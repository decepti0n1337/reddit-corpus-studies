Those forsaken you kill in post cata tristfal where condemned not because they didn't obey the dark lady's will. Instead because thier leader decided to become an enemy. 
---

---
Big difference between being a neutral and an enemy
---
---
---
a centipede is called tusenfoting in Swedish which isn't far off
---
I‚Äôve tried alliance but something keeps pulling me back to horde. I think I‚Äôll do it, main reason would be the shaman.
---
I love how if you sent this meme back in time by a week, literally no one would get it
---
Both. The AP increase you would get esp at a level you're using thrash blade etc just outweighs everything.
---
Air/earth northwest silthus, water northeast felwood , fire center of ungoro
---
I get that level doesnt make a difference, more just checking that I did everything right. I lost to a 21 warlock at level 23 and was told that I was supposed to lose because I was prot spec (did come close to killing him tho after I hamstringed him)
---
Ofc you can catch up
---
Might be rolling for a chest?
---
Pointless post?
---
I second this. Keep it coming
---
Looks like it was still the highest roll.
---
It requires dedicated pvp.  Most people can achieve it as long as you dedicate to it.  Pretty much everyone that gets into pvp groups regularly can hit 10.
---
There you go again thinking like people owe you anything lmao. Keep complaining on reddit.
---
I got one on both my Warlock and Warrior when going through Duskwood. I don't recall getting any in Vanilla though, although I probably did and just vendored or equipped them haha...as is tradition.
---
Only 3h or so farming ZF. Way less than you'll spend trying to get the drop from BRD.
---
The Death Knight starting zone kinda explored this. It was great fun, but I can see it being a mess mechanically
---
I don't even get water from the mages I'm tanking for
---
Had this happen yesterday, me and a friend are pretty chill when it comes to PvP, people just levelling we leave alone.
---
A high level corpse camped us for a bit, we finally got away, saw a Druid in the distance, we didn‚Äôt even say a word to each other, just ran over to him and killed him.
---
All I am seeing is the highest roll
---
Damn that's crazy, it's like 50g on incendius.
---
Are you serious? It's not a common occurrence because there's nothing worth fighting for atm. everyone is levelling and gold farming atm.
---
When phase 2 hits and there's actually a reason to have large scale battles, it will be a problem.
---
Fuck OP for wanting to make sure there's no problem instead of scrambling to fix it as it's happening right?
---
35 runs +  later and i never saw the mainhand :P

7 or 8 offhands

I spent like 10 minutes trying to find people for Araj the Summoner, then saw a huge party of horde storming through Andorhal. Casually walked past them, looted the phylactery and left. Kinda nice of them to make a quest item that's lootable without having to tap the mob.
---
Uh k

Every time I get a blue drop it's shit like [Deanship Claymore](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13049/deanship-claymore).

never had an issue with a mage providing food on Herod. Amazing experience so far. Tip party member mage 30-50s for afew stacks.

Portals going for 1g
---
Maybe he was geared?
---
Usually rogues blows while leveling because they go combat, but if this guy is hemo or something then I could see why he owns you. 
---
At 60, rogues are usually slightly favored versus warriors due to all the CC and stuff you can do, but it depends heavily on gear, but good warriors destroy bad/mediocre rogues completely. It takes a really good rogue to know exactly how to play it, and if they do then they are definitely favored. You could look at some top tier rogue vs warrior gameplay here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0)

I just want my WW axe at 31 QQ

If the orcs where culled after the second war, thrall's horde would not exsist. Leading to azeroth being conquered by either the scourge, burning legion, or silithid. 
---
While the faction war that began during catalysm is both side's fault. Varian was just as hot headed as Garrosh
---
Does it honestly affect the post? You can tell what was dropped
---
You‚Äôre right. Not sure why I had it in my head that it was so long. Though fearing mobs away is also often a way to just aggro even more mobs and be worse off than you started.
---
I just hit 40 this afternoon and my played is 3 days 12 hours
---
It's a goose, actually, but the game doesn't have a title.
---
Omg I have to try steam link
---
Clearly ninja.
---
Does everyone need a key to go into SM arm, or just someone in group? I went to lib and forgot to get key... do I need to run it back?
---
"Hey, these people need to turn multiple quests in to someone, where should we put him? Just have him patrol the entirety of a fucking zone and into another one"
---
And oh yeah, kill five dragons way the fuck out of the way, thank christ we had a couple of mages.
---
As a healer, this is how I distinguish between locks and mages:
---
Locks:  
---
Do lots of dots more dots more dots  
---
Have some AOE  
---
Can heal themselves and don't go OOM, pretty dope  
---
Have an offtank  
---
Can SS me so I can res if we wipe  
---
Give me healthstone without me even asking  
---
Rarely die  
---
Can summon if someone dies and we're deep in the dungeon
---
Mages:  
---
Have water  
---
Have int buff  
---
Can sheep but never will  
---
Many AOEs  
---
More AOEs  
---
Will get aggro  
---
Instead of using Ice Block when they're at 15%hp they will just use more AOE  
---
Die
---
If they're not giving me water and buff then I'd prefer a lock any day
---
this is the greatest love story ever told.
---
Seconded. By itself, you could make an argument for Whirlwind Sword over Axe (sword spec is a bit better than axe spec, and the speed difference is negligible since you don't even get Mortal Strike until 40) but then you realize that the next weapon you get is probably going to be an axe. You can stick with 1 weapon specialization all the way up to 60 if you choose the axe.
---
If you play daggers you play combat daggers right now, not sub or assassination. Seal fate daggers isn't a thing until people are a lot more geared.
---
Mods should just sticky a post about loot rules so I dont see the same thread 5+ times a day.
---
To improve your time tanking:
---
Charge to initiate in a safe spot, Thunderclap(blood rage if you have to), swap to defensive, taunt the most damaged mob, sunder the taunted, sunder again, tab target and use taunt like crazy on targets that are taking damage.
---
Make it a habit to slightly ignore spell casters, they do have aggrieved tables, but move far less, so once the other mobs are corralled, then sunder casters.  If dps can‚Äôt target the same thing you are, try marking targets, if they still don‚Äôt care, ignore them like they are rambling in a foreign language.
---
Because rogues and mages can solofarm it and supposedly average one every 2 hours or so, sank pretty fast once people got some gear.

You know that the tauren are reason why the forsaken where able to join the horde. When wind-runner sent her application Vol'jin voted no and thrall was leaning towards no until the tauren gave a passionate plea

Yea, which to me. Is worse for the game than just reserving an item.

Hahaha now THAT‚ÄôS original content üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I think u can but the rep grind is shit cause you lose more rep then you gain and for completing the entire chain you have quite a high rep to grind for and then back to friendly from whatever hated multiplied rep you‚Äôre already in
---
In my experience I usually find that groups I join from a random whisper are generally more tolerant and polite, even if I fuck up. About half the time when I actively advertise I'm LFG I'm met with some form of toxicity when we get in the instance. And I don't have enough data to form an opinion of groups I start myself as I'm often too lazy to put one together or it's a guild group.
---
That's the real hard core player style. Just need more time to play, but you are the one who enjoys the game best of all of us.

I see you‚Äôre a Doors fan

5g? I will give 10g instead

Wait, other races don't swim crossing every single waterway in the Wetlands? God damnit.
---
That trinket sucks
---
Another thing to consider as a horde player: You don't have (Bo)Salvation. When MC/Ony/ZG/etc become farmable, clearing times will matter a lot. You wouldn't want to go slowly on raids to gear up alts/recruits while you don't need anything from there.
---
Yaaaas
---
Honestly did not expect this to become a thing, but I'd already made this so I thought I might as well post it. Unfortunately the meme magic has ended, I am no longer winning rolls.
---
I'm sorry. You can all stop now.

Just thought I'd share my success or learn something about the trade.
---
And they say that you can't "beat" WoW...
---
&gt;raid logs from private servers where rets are topping the meters
---
Retri paladins topping the charts in Naxx? This is news to me. Maybe retri were buffed at that pserver (something like 2x SoC proc rate)?
---
Aha, thank you a lot. I was just wondering because my brother really wanted the mail chestplate from one faction but didn't realise which faction it was and like an idiot went with the other faction and hes pretty gutted about it, so I was just wondering if I could grind out the rep and do the other line to get him the chestplate without him knowing :D
---
I'm sure you're right in some regard, but I can drink 2 six-packs and be more sober than 4 or 5 shots. Booze seems like it hits significantly harder. Could just be me.
---
 /Roll 99-100
---
Very true
---
I appreciate your post, but I think you're grossly underestimating how much of your time is spent moving from point A to point B in this game.
---
What did you do to earn the gold?
---
Until Blackrock, it's a High-DPS Tank. Just because a Warrior out-DPS's the Utility/Extra classes (Which have laughably been designated "DPS" despite mediocre actual damage-per-second output) doesn't mean they're not a tank as well. It's only once you reach Blackrock that a Damage-built warrior's durability and threat generation keep it from tanking. Everything before then? If you're not tanking, you're deliberately underperforming
---
DPS is everyone's job, and thus not a real one. Some classes are damaged and can't do anything but that, and just take up space in a party.
---
For sure! I actually main a rogue so I know how fun it is but never thought to twink!  
---
  
---
Thing is, kidney shot is so good for pvp and it doesn‚Äôt train till I believe 30-34 sometime. Is this a consideration for aspiring rogue twinks?
---
My god I miss shadow run fps ughhhhhh
---
Banker jargon
---
It's weird that I never concieved of a Hearthstone being that small. I always subliminally thought it was like softball-sized.
---
Must have been 25 atleast. Especially in the northern parts it was crazy! Part of the area and vibe though.
---
I‚Äôve done this too, after they traded me the 1g. I was so embarrassed I sent them back double their money.
---
Hare bear!
---
Awesome! Any knowledge on the shield? :)
---
You could go for the HOTW spec if you want to heal in dungeons and still have an easy time leveling. It's pretty damn good. The trickiest part about leveling as feral is remembering to keep a decent healing set. You will end up tanking dungeons most of the time and might forget to keep your healing gear up to date (especially because it feels so bad to need on something that you only use sometimes, or might not use at all). If you go moonglow this early then at least you will have some decent gear.
---
Took it slow lol I‚Äôm only 43 not even halfway technically but I neither have a lot of time to lvl so makes sense if you play more but slower pace
---
Use the appraise tab for posting, way better imo
---
Sounds like you're playing with shit hunters.
---
I believe he‚Äôs referring to the guard captain one you get from Jintha‚Äôalor
---
What happened is you‚Äôre a prot warrior trying to pvp lmao.
---
Mind Flay would use a debuff slot as well, no?  Downranked MB sounds viable but the cooldown is pretty long.
---
RP server?
---
Pretty sure Prat is doing it (chat addon).
---
I actually liked shaman being pink, can't change it back haha!
---
While I personally was going with druid, I agree. Tanking was such a miserable experience for me in classic, even with *good* groups, that I ended up deleting the toon entirely and rerolling to rogue. (On an aside, I got the toon up to 55, so maybe it was better at 60 but I wouldn't know)
---
I don't even care about stupid dps and all that, it's just rage as a resource is torturous and aggro is so finnicky that it wasn't any fun to deal with even if everything was going smoothly. After leveling a tank and hating it so utterly much, I don't blame anyone for not wanting to do it, warrior or otherwise.
---
What timezone are you, you could probably take out spectre fleets, also my group is looking for au &amp; EUTZ FCs we are mostly autz, but have a small EUTZ presence
---
Look at this guy...has a "wife" and stuff. Flexing on us basement people.
---

---
It is a money sink no matter how you cut it. Amount of mats youve gathered and used to level it instead of selling it alone far outweighs the amount youre making through selling the fish attractors.  
---
Like you have to not only think about how much money youd make by selling the raw mats, but how much money youd be making with a second gathering profession or one that is better at making money like herb+alch. Engineering is a huge money sink and if it wasnt for how good it is in pvp, nobody would use it.

I know you are letting her figure it out but maybe just one nudge towards using WASD and QE for strafing

Living Shoulders are pre-raid bis for resto druids, although the market for them is quite small. The Volcanic set is also in demand for rogues/druids needing fire resist for MC.

Care to link?

There are lots of subtle engineering items that have good profit margins right now.

But like the other user posted, when you share discoveries like this on public places, the prices generally crash so in the end everyone loses.

&gt; She used the forsaken as a tool to take her revenge on Arthas

And yet the forsaken idolize her...
---
This. Forming a group is basically an exercise in finding a tank, so a warrior dps is useless. Worse than that, it will mean a warrior tank won‚Äôt want to join your group as they will want similar loot.
---
There was a chest involved! I missed out on my Stormwind Brie!

Why?  Didn't do any good when I quoted it to you the first time.  If you want to see it hit "parent" a bunch of times.

This comment aged horribly.

So, I tried a different version of this.  I yelled ‚ÄúPRIIINCESSSSS YOUUURRR RIIINNGGGG ISSSS MIIINNNNEEE‚Äù before killing princess in maraudon and it dropped.  Didn‚Äôt have any roll competition so no need to yell for the roll.

How many high rolls did it take for you to get this screenshot?
---
Nice af, but it‚Äôs a duck?
---
It's one of the 5 or so lowest pop servers out of everything in NA. I'd definitely call it relatively dead, if not dead in general. Pop should pick up some as transfers trickle in, though.
---
I hope tauren find someone chill for a change. They kinda stick out as a sore thumb in the horde. Everybody hates everyone, and only tauren are like "Guys could we rather not?"
---
That's called a destiny
---
His sense of entitlement makes him feel like anyone benefiting from something he did means they owe him something. It's zero sum thinking, like that of a child. Some people get stuck in it their whole lives.
---
I started using the "attack nearest target" keybind to switch targets in big groups for this reason. Might help if that's the issue.
---
You might be better off at 40 than what you were at 39, but even at that point you're still the slowest leveler along with paladin. So you might wreck things at level 40 compared to 39, but compare it to any other class you're still very slow.
---
Because they're Cowboy Indians
---
Lol why do you think he wasn't in the end of the video
---
years ago. I don't think they've made 151 since like 2015
---
Leveling prot is just a bad idea all round. It‚Äôs great that you want to be a tank, we totally need more of us around but while levelling, arms and fury actually do a better job tanking dungeons than prot can while also making solo life much more bearable.
---
Ooooo snap
---
&gt;See I talk in ways that challenges and test people. Most simple minded people just get angry...kind of like you.
---
bruh

Close to 46. Having a nice relaxing fun time. I do feel like ive been playing too much though. Cant imagine being 60 right now with feeling guilty about being 46 lol.

This is your best mitigation trinket

(what other trinket in the game atm will give you +25 STR, +25Agi, +25 stam?)
---
Can‚Äôt believe you, a mere child, had the audacity to pvp like a coward.  Be more mature like this guy capiche?
---
A lot of them panic, don't attack, don't use any cc, don't heal etc. They just run around panicking and taking damage and blame you when they die. Maybe ThisPlaceisHell is actually a decent player, but most of the playerbase isn't able to do what he is saying, most of them pull threat and die, full stop. 
---
While kiting a mob and not dying sounds like it's helpful, it's actually the opposite. Instead of 5 players vs 10 mobs, it's now 4 players vs 9 mobs while the 5th is soloing one in the corner. Not very helpful at all and it makes the fight take longer. If he would control his dps and let the tank keep everything on him, stuff would die faster because he could focus a target with the rest of the group, or do light AoE on everything after the tank gets stable threat. Instead, he is running around with a mob on him and making everything take longer. 
---
Him soloing it is better than him dying, but it's not better than him just playing right in the first place. It's so much worse hearing him say that his main is a tank too, because there's just no excuse for it.
---
I don't understand the problem. You're a low-damage and very non-pvp spec, and he's the most durable class in the game. He didn't kill you, but he was able to escape. Serves you right for trying to bully somebody ten levels lower, tbh.
---
Defias traitor in westfall too. Taking his sweet ass time smh
---
&gt; Instead of using Ice Block when they're at 15%hp they will just use more AOE
---
&gt; Die
---
You missed "heal heal OMG HEALER HEAL" while AoEing and "bad heals" after dead.
---
I'd love to man but I sold my account a while back and just don't have the time anymore. I have one I'm just using to farm SP, but irl stuff has kinda made it impossible to play anymore.
---
Sometimes at Booty Bay I stealth onto a freshly loaded boat and pick an Alliance who would see me as skull, unstealth in front of them, emote /lick, then restealth.
---
Then I just sneak off the boat before it leaves.

This is how antivaxx started
---
Sweet. Gonna start charging for each weapon swing on my rogue.
---
Internet is filled with thousands of people complaining about retarded mages, yeah, literally must be my server, you're not being myopic at all.
---
Why did you put up with him for so long in the first place? You can find like 3 dps within 2 minutes for ZF.
---
That's not how statistics work...
---
So in the end, unless you are also putting points into the Improved Imp talent, it's not worth it? 
---
My thinking was with the Imp going OOM quicker, I could put him on passive once he is empty, and he could start to recover even in the same fight (or do pets not really recover during combat?)  
---
Thank you again Kylo!
---
I‚Äôve been playing private servers for 5+ years and speed clearing content with top pserver guilds but thx. Your pro tips from 14 years ago when this was current content are really helpful
---
I'm a healer with a Tank buddy running SM gy for the first time. I messed up and lost track of the tank. He died. We killed the trash. I res and buff him and start drinking. All the while the rogue decided it was a good idea to pull the boss.
---
Not the first time the rogue pulled multiple things. And yes we told him to stop multiple times.
---
And then the very next instance, sm lib, my tank buddy went dps. We got a level 42 warrior tank (who loves to play in zerker stance apparently) pulling two sets of elites when I'm drinking at 40% Mana. And he's two rooms away. For fucks sake.
---
No really. 
---
Stay in stealth. 
---
They are pretty much rogues hard counter.  
---
Severely out gearing them aside... Unless they completely screw up, you pretty much lose 100% of the time.
---
Alternate strategy:  run to a shadow priest and watch the hunter melt into a puddle.
---
Huh must have been left over shit I was drinking I definitely had some in 16.
---
Just caught 150 fish today. Level 39, but wanted to get artisan fishing lol

I got my warrior to 33 and when he was around lvl 10, made a lock as bank char. Then I realized how much fun it is to be op/not die all the time and lvld my lock. Hit 20 on her last night. 
---
One of the coolest things so far was the last bit of my WW axe questline: I couldn't find any helpers to help fight Cyclonian, and so I just sat at the quest guy not knowing what to do. Couple of minutes later, two ally warriors came along: A lvl 30+ and a lvl 60, and summoned the elemental. (I play on Flamelash EU, which is a PVP server) I followed them, and helped them with the (elite) elemental.
---
After the kill, we communicated with emotes, and the allys eventually motioned me to summon the elemental - and helped me kill it. This was an awesome showing of solidarity among players, and really gave me a fuzzy warm feeling :)
---
Does Shadowmeld not work in classic wow!?
---
It's me! Philadelphia Collins!!
---
you could try selling jed runs, reserve the trinket for the caster/healer who wants it. Fill the group with people you know or random melee dps. Masterloot the trinket to them for 150g. Just make sure everyone knows its reserved
---
If it all goes to hell and no charge, no rage and mobs are running by you - I used to Blood Rage, switch to Battlestance - mocking blow 1 -  switch to Def stance - taunt a different 1 and hope you get hit enough to generate rage enough to demo/Battleshout and keep it going with sunders.
---
Tbh in a low rage start - the onus is on the DPS to tone it down and let you get the rage ball moving.
---
If not her, then who are they going to turn to..?
---
Warriors can't be compared to rogues. They take more damage than rogues because rogues have high dodge, and their kill times are way slower. I leveled a warrior to 60 and I'm now leveling a rogue, for solo content there's really no comparison.
---
39 was another very popular twink bracket back in the day, little more variability between specs and a lot of classes get some really good abilities 30-39
---
If I was Blizzard I would insta perma ban him
---
If you haven't invested time in a social circle on yojamba, i highly recommend taking up the server transfer to felstriker. Did it 2 weeks ago, best decision i ever made.
---
Dungeons are chill, 90% are quest runs. No spam for magecleave at all. 
---
The pop's a bit lower, but not enough for me to be worried. It's still way more than original vanilla server cap.
---
I couldn't believe the difference, honestly. Yojamba ended up being a toxic hellhole, compounded further by the ridiculous pop size and faction imbalance.
---
Yeah I know I did that from BC until I quit in Cata. (I really didn‚Äôt like Cata)
---
I had some enchanter get pissy that I only wanted to tip 1g for him doing my enchant using my mats, like dude...you're the one spamming for work and this cost you literally nothing.
---
Sow dissent, scam members, poach members...there aren't a lot of ways to manipulate a guild in wow but it can be done.
---
I snagged bonebiter as a paladin right at 34 best decision ever
---
Just looked it up it was discontinued in 2016, man vegas wont be the same next time I go.
---
It is fine. Bonebiter is a better weapon than Whirlwind (alliance only I think) and in a pinch you can grab Ravager from Herod. So there are 3 axes around 35-38dps in that level range. The point of the WW weapons is you can if you try get them earlier than the other two.

As if they don't have to work, take care of family members, foster relationships with other adults (aka 'friendships' and 'relationships), engage in other hobbies (including staying in shape and other self-improvement), do household chores including cooking, basic hygiene, etc.
---
I mean even assuming you're a kid, 75% of the year you have to go to school.  If you're a NEET, that's cool and all, but you probably are neglecting other aspects of your life.
---
So yeah, I gave you a shitpost response, because I couldn't believe that you were being serious.
---
As much as I get ganked, I figured I'd return the favor, but I guess it serves me right. Im on a pvp server, so please dont talk about bullying, as ganking is so fucking commonplace on there. Cant count the number of times some ally ganked me while I was fighting mobs or had three people 5 levels higher jump on me.
---
im on the same position, already started leveling a mage becose my lvl60 tank warrior is terrible at gold farming
---
Uh ya? It‚Äôs not 10 seconds of cast time, I gotta either wait for you or teleport to you. You wanna be cheap, enjoy your run to Darn.

You have to ask yourself, what is "defense". 1 defense equates to 0.4 % dodge, miss, parry. I've always viewed the stat as a "deflector shield". Defense just makes you harder to hit, which is why you need to wear hit gear to be able to ensure your attacks land on level 60+ mobs. You want to get hit, you want to take damage. Taking damage is a good thing. You're a Tauren, your hp pool can easily get over 8K atm. However you don't have the luxury of weapon skill, so you desperately need 9% hit to ensure all of your yellow hits(sunders) land.
---
Then you have to ask yourself, would I rather the 3.6% dodge, miss, parry from the trinket, or would I rather the 1% hit, 1%crit, 13 agi(extra armor, crit, dodge) and +10 stam.
---
Focus IS in classic but it‚Äôs hidden. You can set focus and attack focus like normal but you don‚Äôt get a focus frame.
---
what is jed and why wold someone pay 150g to get a trinket instead of just running the instance normaly?
---
I always wondered... how the horde could still keep the forsaken in their fold after this. And countless other "betrayals".
---
It just shows how bad the writing for WoW has been over the years, past the "vanilla" and maybe "burning crusade" times.
---
How are you soloing mobs in gnomer , let alone bosses? How are you able to gouge and bandage ? They are immune to gouge
---
Yesterday we had  MH, OH, Briarwood, Finkles, and Deflector in the same run. It was spicy.

Ok that‚Äôs your choice, no one asked you to in the first place lol.

Thanks for the advice, do you know where I can buy one of those backwards hats too?

I‚Äôm finding with this combo it‚Äôs faster to 2v1 every second pull than 1v1 when you can pop the combo
---
yup, and the spy addon beeps when an enemy is near! they should not let people access that info
---
Sounds about right, based on my experience on both sides of this equation. At some point you just can't burst through the plate hard enough to take them down, and their fear + snare + bleed + MS + ugh, fuck this, I'm going back to pickpocketing.

Is there ANY possible way to transfer from Grobbulus to Bloodsail Buccaneers? It's not in the list of servers when I try to transfer and I can't find a way to buy a transfer either
---
There's a difference between seeing someone standing outside SM with you and going, "Hey, do you mind tanking X?" and someone messaging you in Orgrimmar while you are already in a group or in the middle of Badlands questing, asking if you want to tank Cath for them. 
---
That being said, OP was NOT complaining about getting messaged to tank. He was complaining about the way tanks are treated in dungeons, and informing people that tanks are switching to DPS, and that is why people are forced to try and spam message tanks, since none of them want to tank anymore. He was being hyperbolic, but he was complaining about something entirely different because he actually wants to tank, for proper people at least. Someone like me who only wants to DPS on warrior is the person complaining about people using that fucking addon to spam message every warrior, druid and shaman.
---
Bind markings to T, Shift T, Ctrl T, and Alt T. That's four symbols right off the bat. All you lose is the start autoattack keybind.

They pumped out possibly 100+ severs around the world and created multiple layers for each server. They‚Äôll never tell us their exact numbers, but I‚Äôd imagine they are doing pretty well.
---
Yep. I was always a mediocre rogue and honestly I couldn't time the damn combo points, plus getting weapons that could do enough damage was always an issue (if you're not raiding you don't have access to them).
---
What's your problem? He said he's new to wow and just wants some advice he's not sooking about it

If that pally would have bop'd him, that would have been sick

You are definitly  not off the cheseburgers
---
I think 0.0000000001% chance of that occurring if you attempted to replicate it.
---
But there aren‚Äôt bodies to contest them...that‚Äôs my point. If you think the alliance has a chance of contesting world bosses on Stalleg you didn‚Äôt experience the outrageous imbalance.
---
Like I understand your point, just in terms of Stalleg and how bad the faction balance is the alliance has no chance.

Is this the comment you're talking about? Because it doesn't say what you claim it says.
---
As a druid tank, don't do this. I spam tab on multitarget pulls, just hit the skull or blizzard 2 mob pulls, w/e floats your boat.
---
I just tried that at 52 and whilst it was certainly doable.. it was very slow and often meant voidwalker sacrifice then eating. I'd hang at least to 54 before trying again.
---
Hand of Rag is way worse than BRE for PvP. It's also way worse than the rank 14 weapons, and at a super high cost. Any hardcore guild is stocking up on gold+mats to prepare for phase 2. Because of that, anyone in a hardcore guild going for hand of rag would have to pay for it all by themselves.
---
then you must be new to the internet

I‚Äôve also been doing this for years (minus the running in WoW).

Been questing in STV for 6 hours and no ganks yet. It helps if you wait til you have a mount and are 5 levels above the north side noobs.

What the fuck do you not understand about 
---
&gt;**inviting me as a dps** then **expecting me to tank**
---
PART ONE:  INVITED AS DPS
---
PART TWO:  TOLD THEY CAN'T DPS AND ASKED TO TANK INSTEAD.
---
PART THREE: KRISSAM HURTS HIMSELF IN CONFUSION.
---
It takes a few minutes for the flowers to replenish before someone else can get the buff too. I'm not sure how long it stays cleansed though.
---
The healer should have zero downtime to begin with.
---
You can easily drink while the rest of the group is pulling the next pack, and  the only downtime would be a wipe. 
---
Honestly, this is just telling me you aren't that good of a healer, which is fine. Just don't try to say wrong information on reddit.
---
(I am a healer fyi)
---
Jed is a rarespawn in ubrs that drops 3 items, one of those items is a Best in slot item for multiple phases. So you will have it for a while and because its so good there is alot of competition for it. Usually a pug group of 10 people will have like 6 fuckin people all trying to get it. Which wouldnt really be an issue if it wasnt for the fact hes a rare spawn so it makes it a little trickier. Some people would rather just buy the trinket instead of running it a shit ton.
---
A mage can farm the 150g faster than it would be to grind for the trinket (unless your very lucky and get it right off the bat)
---
/r/whoooosh
---
I'd join the last if I where you
---
It also uploads the screenshot to a website of your liking.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work, the game processes the roll before the yell :(
---
He's a rare spawn. Trinket is bis for every healer and caster.
---
U play mtg?
---
And why do you say that? Sounds like you're a rogue who does exactly that and is pissy about being called out.
---
This is true. I was Plat 1 2 wins into my promo and I duoed with a friend d who threw 2 games in a row. I played the last game by myself and lost... got tilted started dropping hard never got to diamond. Took me a while to talk to him again. Couple weeks IRL friend.
---
I support this idea and now need to find a friend to do it with.
---
I play a healer and I never have problems when locks are in my group.
---
I mostly have to end up telling them to stop fucking drinking and just life tap, since I'll have more mana than I need to and their dps is better than me using mana to dps.
---

---
How are you inviting someone as dps then expecting them to tank?
---
Like what possible scenario could come up where what you claim this describes would ever happen?
---
This is op saying "I can dps" and them saying "tank or no go".
---
What did I miss?
---
P = 7/(7-2)2 X 0.02^2 X (1-0.02)^7-2
---
Probably messed it up.

It's not bad, it's that people think blues like this are worth waaaaay more than they are right now. I can only imagine how much they spend on AH listing when no one is buying it.
---
How else?  You ask for a tank and DPS, when someone whispers you saying they will DPS you invite them.  No mention of them tanking, just DPS.  And then instead of looking for a tank, you ask them to tank.
---
What fucking hole did you crawl from and how do you fail to understand?
---
Ohhh my favorite.
---
Group asked me to tank as a paladin. 
---
I put salv on everyone. Run goes smooth for 5 minutes.
---
Then mage goes "wtf give me wisdom". I give into his demand and give him wisdom.
---
Guess who started to complain about me not holding threat?
---
Badlands is a good zone. Easy enough quests,Lots of mobs to tag,good rewards and grays that sells for a lot
---
We had different experiences. Mine was mostly getting ganked by packs of horde until I gave up and ran SM again.
---
Make peace with your inevitable demise.
---
Other people made the choice of playing a class that is less efficient. Should we be upset with them too? 
---
This would be the same as being frustrated that someone "wasting" time cooking their own dinner is taking a job away from someone because they could just make enough money an hour at their job to pay  someone to do it.
---
Worry about your self and not what others are choosing to do with their time.

Just like how the group couldnt have the chest without you unlocking it, YOU couldn't have the chest without the group clearing to it.

Level 55 Ele Shaman here, wondering if I can effectively heal the end game dungeons and raids or if I should bite the bullet and respec Resto.  I want to stay Ele for as long as I can for questing and pvp but I'm getting to the end game content now and I'm concerned I won't be able to fill the healer slot.
---
Can I stay Ele for dungeons/MC/Ony?
---
Should I be switching to Resto now or can I ride the lightning awhile longer?
---
Some build suggestions would also be appreciated if anyone has advice to share, this is my first time going through end game WoW content.
---
Yes they should be, if memory serves me correctly they were in the ~30g range back in the day.
---
So... finally you get it, OP was never invited to dps, he was invited to tank.
---
As someone who just respecced to moonglow for raiding I'm pretty happy that people are minmaxing so hard that they decided to not play druids, because that just means there's more loot for me. Same goes for the druid tank in our guild. 
---
I've seen guilds opening recruitment exclusively for resto druids, because there are barely any to be found.
---
In Wrath of the Lich King.
---
For level 60?
---
I guess that depends.  I usually don't tip if it's an instance.
---
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you pay it forward, give people who could use it for their mount 30g once you can afford it and all will be forgiven.
---
In TBC i believe.

On the other side of it, me and my friends have to tell the mages to fucking stop casting AOE every pull because we enjoy doing some cc and single targetting stuff. Learn what every mob does and which to prioritize.

yes.
---
Definitely worth the trouble for me. It's much better than the other chests and practically equal to T1, and I never know when I'll see T1 drop (and also get it LCed to me, though we only have 1-2 hunters in our raids). It could be next week just like it could be in 2 months.
---
I've started soloing Angerforge for HoJ and it's much worse IMO, you rely on good RNG and hope you don't get any Feign Death resists. Then again, arena was also relying on RNG to get the damn orc to spawn.
---
As of right now there is no option to switch a realm not on the free transfer list. Paid server transfers do not exist but I'm confident they will add them later on.
---
Lol you mean once you have all of your aoe abilities you can do 3 mobs most of the time? I had pretty much the most ideal pull on 2 mobs a while ago, when I was level 35, and they still got me to half hp. [Here's a vid of the pull](https://youtu.be/DfIxw86ldc8)
---
With whirlwind/demo/fear yea 3 mobs is doable, but levels 1-35 if you fight 3 mobs with no cds you're pretty much fucked. Idk if I'd use thunderclap if I'm soloing I don't think it's worth it.. I'd rather save the rage and wait for ww to be off cd
---
As a person who will never be able to get those ‚Äúfirst time play WoW‚Äù feels, it makes me really happy than tons of people are getting that experience. Because it‚Äôs such a great feeling.
---
It's called the HOTW spec. It's mainly feral but you grab nature's swiftness in the resto tree. You can tank, melee dps (not super well but well enough) and heal just fine in 5 man dungeons.
---
Can you like lock your exp/level or something to stay in the bracket?

---
A pve game? Are we playing the same game? The pve is a joke the whole point of it is for the pvp
---
They ask in LFG for a tank and DPS.  OP asks them to DPS.  OP gets an invite.  OP is in their party as DPS.  Party gets bored looking for a tank.  Party asks OP to switch to tank instead of DPSing.  
---
All this other shit you're making up and pulling out of your ass doesn't exist.

Saying he wasn't invited to DPS is flat out wrong.  That's the entire point.

Out of combat only. As soon as you get in combat you can't shadow meld.
---
I don't think so.
---
If you go combat daggers do you use backstab as a combo generator or still ss?
---
Wands still have a cast time.  Are we really making excuses for people?  Its blatantly obvious what you're doing when you do it.
---
I've never had anyone just need on everything, they'd instantly get kicked on my server.
---
I‚Äôm just saying, for me it‚Äôs worked 100% of the time (1 out of 1). With a sample size that big who can deny it? :)
---
Really?  Does this work with macros, too?  Like, can I [@focus] in a macro?
---
One fucking Whilrwind is instant threat if you pop that shit in the first 8 seconds or so. The only time you are allowed to do dumb shit like that is in a full Meleecleave when you are all doing it. 
---
I've seen this with rogues and warriors a lot, they see their energy or rage bars at half and feel compelled to instantly use it all up in burst. Save it. As long you aren't at max energy/rage, it's not wasted. You can reapply shouts or do a single target ability to keep yourself from capping out and then when the tank has threat established, you can start using it. Most won't even keep 10 resource so they can interrupt shit, it's really sad.
---
I use NeatPlates and have mob health always turned on. It shows me whenever I have or am about to pull threat on an enemy by coloring their bar. I can then switch to another target and not be a pain in the tanks ass. More DPS should learn about his and use it, it's an invaluable tool.
---
No, you‚Äôre just being a bunch of whiners.
---
You can do it starting at 36 when you get whirlwind, but 3 is hard to the point where you can still die and 4 is a real stretch. With 3 I sometimes have to fear and bandage
---
[Here's a vid](https://youtu.be/DfIxw86ldc8) of the most ridiculous rng luck I've gotten vs 2 mobs at 35... and I still ended the fight with half hp lmao. Whirlwind + sweeping strikes shreds though so 3 mobs isn't a death sentence anymore just not really ideal lol
---
üëâüòéüëâ Zoop!
---
From my experience vanilla  years back I stacked all the mana/ 5sec items to keep casting all the time without going oom.  Very high heals where not that important after all...  But overall heal was high as I never stopped casting for long.
---
It wasn't any set in particular just best mana / 5 sec items from all armor classes I could wear.
---
lmao what is this post
---
I've had pala dps, tank, and healers in dungeons. I know a pala who raids as ret. Bear tanks are amazing and do tank in endgame. Resto druids are highly coveted because they're super rare and have a great kit.  
---
idk about shamans since I'm alliance but they're cute wolves
---
Some things will increase some things will get cheaper. It depends case by case, but in general gold inflates in wow so things will on average cost more gold over time.
---
[removed]
---
I think a Blizz GM would laugh and then ban the botter. I think you're in the clear
---
You're saying 15% crit to the party is not going to make up for the MINISCULE dps difference between a Druid and a Warlock? Get real. The true reason you don't see Druids everywhere is because of the mana problems. Here's the thing though, with a correct raid comp and consumes, fights will never go long enough for mana pool to matter. Also Boomkins bring a rebirth and an innervate to the raid. You're literally stuck in your opinion of 'there are meme specs and there are real specs' and your ignorance is just perpetuating it all. Get educated about hybrid specs.
---
Some mats that are integral in levelling professions will rise in value because people won't want to farm them. Some weapons that are good for twinks will rise in value too
---
Most hardcore classic players are PvPers, not PvE players as raids are very easy. Going for rank 14 will be extremely competetive, and will require the ones who want it first to use raidconsumes while doing BGs. 14-18 hours a day, every day for 5 months. This will costs tens of thousands of gold, using gold to craft hand of rag is a huge waste of resources and ensures that you're going to have to play twice as much now to stay competetive in phase 2. That being said, OP is probably not a hardcore player, considering the choice of his realm. Any realm on EU aside from the "mega-realms" Gehennas or maybe Firemaw will simply lack competiton at the very top-end.
---
Why are you talking shit when you made an objectively stupid decision? Obviously you cared enough to sink enough time to get max level and are now raiding, don‚Äôt make fun of people that play the game smarter than you.
---
The game has been out for 15 years, which is why people are now smart enough to tell you how dumb you are LOL
---
Haha that's actually perfect. It's really one of the most regular "that was a movie" movies I think I've seen. It's too bad that such a cool premise was wasted though
---
I think it's neat that in some cases elves and tauren put aside their differences for druidic purposes at least.

badlands is hell i couldnt wait to escape

looks like /r/classicwow has found their upvote content for the week
---
Yes im 60 warlock, i farmed gold for robe of the void mats and epic Mount in mara(100g away) 
---
I would draintank untill lvl 60, then switch to sm/ruin for dungeons. When you are comfortable with sm/ruin you can goldfarm with it fine. An alternative for ezpz goldfarm is sm/ds, for more sustain(siphon life/fel stamina) 
---
This guy has sm/ds as a pure goldfarm spec:

Commenting to follow up later today :) Thanks for the tip!
---
I use the number pad.  That way they're still easily accessable, but not taking up valuable keybinds space I might need in combat.
---
Wish I did it in a memorable way but I was too burnt out and I just wanted it to be over lol. I don‚Äôt have fun playing solo and for some reason none of my friends could play when I was 59 so it was miserable.
---
You're forgetting most people are a lot worse then they think they are.  You are obviously a skilled player, alot of people have problems even doing the simplest of things.  So your advice is not valid 90% of the time.  Usually a ranged will pull something, then run away from the tank and jump around like and idiot. until either they die, or pull another group and kill everyone.  I guarantee that is most tanks experience.
---
My brothers been having this same problem as a warrior so now he just tells them hes a two hander tank. It's worked out well so far.
---
Nature prot pots sell for 45s now but will be 2-3 g each when aq40 releases. It depends on the mats
---
lol.
---
To be fair I drink a shitton of cheap domestic lagers (Old German, PBR, Hamm's, etc) and drink hard booze about once a year on the 4th of july, sometimes for friends' birthdays. I don't think the two have separate tolerances, and in my experience a shot feels like 2-3 PBR's worth of drunk. The OP commenter also pointed out that 2 sixers are going to take much longer to drink, which I didn't really consider either.
---
The Macro Toolkit addon he uses in the video seems to work for classic so thats pretty cool. Cheers.
---
Same in mine.
---
Yes you should be able to transfer all your characters, although you have to initiate them one at a time (ie there's no transfer all button). Just make sure you transfer them all before they close down transfers or you might get stuck with some characters on one server and some on the new server.
---
Yeah so for four levels pre 40 you can kill 2. I've never said 2 was difficult, because of ss/ww. I'm saying that 3 is nigh impossible to do consistently and not in a panic, potion drinking scenario. You just dont have the health or self healing to deal with 3 mobs damage without CDz being blown.
---
the numbers on wowhead are way off, like it says the drop rate on essence of air from dust stormers is 24%. It's more like 3-5% averaged out.

Oh aye, let me wait months for my BiS piece to drop and not be outbid like a good priest.  /roll is /roll.

Take it or don't join.  Your loot expectations need to be announced before the run and if you have a problem with someone rolling on the head, don't join that pug.
---
Hell, the fact people are pugging it makes the head even less prized.
---
The last one seems a bit different from the rest but I don't know why...

Quality content
---
Few Q's for you
---
Could you, Or would you be willing to share this spec? 
---
And would I be requiring 2 sets of gear? Ele / Resto?
---
Is this spec Viable for 5man MC and ONY? No mana tide totem kind of sucks =(
---
Also how are Devilsaurs no problem? they F me up haha.
---
Some will, some wont.
---
It depends on what's available in the phase, and what people are looking to do.
---
Not sure what you mean by this. Iron grenades sell for the same price on my server as the mats used to make them. No hustle to be had, unless you mean making $ via mining, which is def a nice way to grind out some gold
---
You don't gain experience in classic battlegrounds.

Yeah of course I do, and my instances are smooth as butter, no one dies, people want to group with me again and I shred the meters.

While everything you said is absolutely true, this post was still about PvE guilds in the frame of recruiting talent. Most guilds aren‚Äôt recruiting players to gear them up, only to completely lose them to PVP grinds in the near future. Sure lots of folks are planning to do that, and the PVPers are raiding right now to get their pre-PVP BiS gear, but that wouldn‚Äôt be the focus of a guilds recruitment strategy for the purposes of this context.

Thanks for all your help man very much so appreciated. If i could give you more than upvotes I would.
---
That was an interesting read. Thank you for linking it. However I'm not sure how that pertains to this. It does a good job explaining why an enhancement shaman is invited. You bring one for your melee group. Then that enhancement shaman needs to be on the ball with totem twisting, mana pots, etc to pull his weight. I definitely agree. But there's no sense in saying: enhancement shamans in a raid, LOL. It's nonsense to think that way.
---
Unless you mean the secret boss in cath then the last boss in cath aggros all non boss mobs to fight which would mean it wasnt the rogue?
---
Set smaller goals for yourself. Instead of full levels, focus on "I'm going to complete all quests in this zone" or "I'm going to open all flight paths on the continent" or whatever. Making your own goals and achieving them is one of the big benefits of classic.
---
In like 5 years.
---
dazzling longsword is one of the bis weapons for 39 twink rogues bc of it‚Äôs proc lmao.
---
F is my favourite keybind for abilities. Any idea of the name of the interface option? I'd like to rebind it but unsure where to look.
---
Only 36?
---
&gt; They are fine for the 90% of the player base who doesn't ~~raid or~~ care about min maxing. 
---
fixed that for you. Who the hell cares about minmaxing.
---
And if they need a boe they equip it before leaving the dungeon.
---
No, you basically just stop all kind of pve/XP gaining gameplay.
---
?
---
* A) 95% of raids are not min-maxing to the point where bringing a specific class/race combo is not an option. You'd need to be in guilds like &lt;APES&gt; or &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt; to be part of that 5%.
---
* B) A Ret Paladin who knows his class, brings consumes, and is geared can top meters. There are numerous raid logs on private servers at end-game where rets are destroying. Particularly in BWL on Nefarian, Naxx trash, Garr, etc. **Fights do not last long enough for them to go oom**. 
---
* C) You are not going to see dual wield Fury warriors going 2H just due to competition. That would actually void their chances of obtaining good dual wield weapons. If a Warrior gets BRE then yes he will go slam or MS (when BWL comes out) spec but you're not going to see Sulfuras wielding warriors in raids. **They don't benefit from it as much as Enhance/Rets** do.
---
* D) BRE outdpses Sulfuras under all situations. No Warrior is going to take Sulfuras if they're just going to get BRE. THEREFORE you should give it to classes who WON'T get BRE, such as Paladins or Shamans (unless literally nobody wants BRE).
---
Either it happens or it doesn‚Äôt. Math :p
---
Because it can result in feeling really shitty. This is when you want to hit level 60 and want to do the endgame content but you always stop halfway to the goal to start something new. It is often not even fun anymore, it is like some stupid addiction.
---
The other guy rolled a 1...just showing it works
---
Nice name
---
I leveled an orc warlock first, got to 40, and then decided to level an orc shaman. Whose almost 40. I loved lock in retail, but I also love healing. For me, lock is super fun in pvp. However, when I saw my warrior friend pulling insane dps numbers in scarlot monastery with ww axe and windfury totem as he tanked......something just said. "why the hell didn't you roll shaman to begin with". 
---
Now I will say this. Lock is sooooooo much easier to level. You never stop. Or hardly ever stop. Being a shaman close to 40 feels like a shittier warrior. Sure i can heal, but I'm in leather and these raptors hit hard. 
---
You are, however, the anti caster as shaman. And I mean, it's dirty. You dispell their buffs. You have 6 second interrupt. You have tremor for fesr and charm (party wide), you have grounding for poly or a spell. It just, hurts. Whereas lock your dots hit like a truck and you can run away and still kill them. 
---
Lock will always be a class dear to my heart. I love the lore and the feel. The playstyle of being the ultimate support in shaman, though, won me over in the end.
---
that's pretty terrible rng. When I was doing the airs the first three were one per fifty kills. After that they went kind of streaky and I'd start getting two or three within a few kills of each other.
---
I did that in durotar the first week. Just skinned the mobs the bot was killing.
---
Sounds like a bad tank
---
For some reason I always thought it was like...the size of a person‚Äôs torso. Never really put much thought into it.
---
8 hours a day? Maybe 10 years ago I could have, lol. Damn.
---
Blind vanish and sap are you‚Äôre best friends.
---
Yeah  ut I'm racking up xp and loot lol
---
I'm just reading where it says VANCOUVER
---
&gt;Wowhead isn't really clear on when it gets added.
---
Not sure if you're expecting classes to change so just want to point out for the record that classes are not changing at all during the classic phases. Not until they do TBC/classic+/whatever.
---
The way they are now is it for the foreseeable future.
---
I would consider myself a casual (but consistent) player. I am level 47, I have a mount, im broke af. Slowly questing my way through Tanaris and Feralas. I will soon start BRD/UBRS/LBRS so search for Pre-Raid BiS.
---
Omg herbing is painful on max settings haha. Someone should almost write a macro to toggle the setting from high to low
---
Not around my place...  Some things are only found in former Western Germany...
---
It's exactly 2 both in Frankfurt...  Never known  this before.
---
I‚Äôm a gnome you wouldn‚Äôt be bothered. When I use a noggenfogger I look like bait
---
I like your plant
---
I would have missed it if not for you.
---
Make macros for all your abilities that have /startattack before the ability.
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm wrong I can‚Äôt read. Long day. I apologize.
---
Just put 51 points in that tree and your covered.
---
That is not to say that they weren't just running 2 or more raids. Even my guild expects to run two raids 2-3 weeks after we begin raiding.
---
I‚Äôm still having a hard time understanding how them not giving up ensures they will get a world boss when they are freshly released and relevant.  The ratio split is horrendous and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much leg work you put in when Horde guilds on Stalleg have already stated they will have world bosses on farm. There is only so much you can do with that ratio and for every raid group alliance makes the horde will make 4. How much effort they put in means nothing. If the ratio was closer I would agree but if they kill one in the first couple weeks I would be very surprised.
---
Tip for casual players who can only play in short spurts is to try grinding, if i only have 30 minutes or so to play in each session i'll pick grind spots and just go grind out that time. Makes for some faster leveled and if done right will be making you gold too.
---
Not relevant at low level, but when you hit the late 30s/40s/50s it can be faster.
---
&gt; You're right tho, every spec brings utility to the raid. Some more than others. Resto shamans bring 100% of the utility an enhancement shaman brings, at 95% effectiveness, but also bring way more healing and flexibility.
---
I did most of my hardcore raiding as Alliance so I have not heard of many healer shamans going Enhancement for that talent alone. That may be marginally better but I have my doubts. I'd rather have a worse DPS than a worse healer, that's for sure. Losing a potential Mana Tide totem seems not worth it.
---
&gt; The only reason i see in bringing a enhancement shamans is your raid being heavy on melee and low on shamans, or as a nightfall bot.
---
This is a misconception. Shamans and Paladins are very poor Nightfall weilders. They lack fast spammable abilities which yields low uptime on the proc. Warriors are the ones who should use it as they can spam hamstring. This is because Nightfall is not on a PPM (procs per minute).
---
Badlands is crazy if you're skin/mine go to whelp area.
---
I guess. There are tons of games to play so I‚Äôm not mad to be pretty much done with classic.
---
I dont play rogue but see NugEnergy mentioned often.
---
except you rarely ever see a mage kite, they just cast aoe after aoe and stand there untill they die. And if they don't die they they suck up all the healers mana :(

Coming back soon (tm)

I loved stuff like this in vanilla. My guild used to raid redridge after raids.
---
What‚Äôs your add on for the moving portrait and ui?
---
...what?
---
Seriously, who? Point the fucker out. Desolace is beautifully dark, it‚Äôs such a nice change of pace from most of the rest of Azeroth.
---
Damn, he said that? I blocked him so fast. It‚Äôs sad how narcissistic some gamers are. He should socialize and probably take meds to chill out.
---
Playing Fire spec to go against the grain. Best thing about Pyroblast is the 6 second casting time gives them plenty of time to build threat. Good opening then switch to fireblast/fireball with a little bit of flamestrike for good measure when there are 3+ mobs.
---
This 100%. Slam Warriors do not use Sulfuras. They'd 100% use BRE, and since you do MC it would not be hard to obtain one, especially if you make the case to your guild that you plan to use it for raiding.
---
Downside of warrior man. I play a shaman, only one viable spec. Feelsbad but atleast warrior has a choice. And it‚Äôs not just the party‚Äôs time saved, it‚Äôs OP‚Äôs. As long as he tells the party ‚Äúyo, I‚Äôm rolling on damage gear too‚Äù, then it simply sounds like the smart move
---
No thanks
---
Tell him why then add to ignore. Someone like that isn't going to be worth hearing the replies.
---
**ElvUI** is a majority of the UI. (including the unit frames)
---
**Shadowed Unit Frames** is an addon that can do what you want, though. Highly configurable.
---
It really is lol, even just a change of scene takes away the monotony for a lot of us. I did ~20 hours of cath farm and ~20 hours of ZF farm to buy my epic and freezing bands, etc and i'll literally take grinding elementals over going back inside either of those instances for a few weeks.
---
Considering I am statistically the #1 rogue DPS on my server, Incendius, most people above 20 IQ would disagree
---
Interface options &gt; targeting &gt; scroll down to Assist Target
---
I dinged 60 last night turning rends head in with the watching buff being given to everyone
---
Yes, changing the loot schedule is how they ‚Äúreserve‚Äù. Saying ‚Äúall greed‚Äù may end up in a ninja looting.
---
Nice.
---
It‚Äôs really cool! It can definitely be difficult to do multiplayer things, but single player stuff if works out just fine. If you set up your keyboard correctly you can cast nearly any ability/spell you need to. Then just make sure you have two different mouse setups, because trackpad is easier for fixing the camera while you may want to actually click on things without a trackpad.
---
If fighting is too difficult just do stuff like sell, AH, craft, fish, travel, etc. It can save you time later on for when you can actually play.
---
Vendors, quest givers, that sort of thing. The dishonorable kill thing was a massive mistake and I'm not happy they're using it. In a raid and one person pulls a DK Target? Too bad, everybody loses honor.  But #nochanges giveth and taketh.
---
so you're saying you have to put a heavier burden on the healer because dps sucks? still sounds like it's dps who should play different not the tank
---
Sungrass is a bitch to find for sure.
---
Enhancement shaman can most definitely dual weild
---
If you rolled a mage, you chose dps only.  If you rolled shaman you chose dps or healing.  Technically you can tank as a shaman in 5mans if you know what you‚Äôre doing but it won‚Äôt be as effective as a war or bear tank.  Rolling a war gives you the choice of dps or tank.  It does not default you to tank.
---
thank you for the inputs. I ended up rollin in stallagg. I'm reluctant to go into the newer servers because of all the talk about them eventually dying once the hype is gone.
---

borderline not possible w/o max rank blizzard. you already need to blow mana gems every pull if you aren't well geared with stats allocated for aoe farming
---
Yeah I‚Äôm nearly 60 and I‚Äôm having a hard time finding a guild with open tank spots.  I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll get better once i finish farming out my prebis in a few days but It‚Äôs not looking good.
---
The trinket is hot garbage. The neck is bis forever. What a blunder. I wouldn‚Äôt even wear that trinket, it does nothing except make you look like a clown when people inspect you.
---
I have yet to see anyone blame a tank in classic like this but yeah it's tough.
---
As someone who used to tank at the end of vanilla and through out bc though this is why i lost interest in it, with a good group or guildies or friends its fun but with randoms it can be like pulling teeth and then you get blamed in the end too. 
---
Usually you can tell them what you want and they will listen or give a reason why they don't want to, if they don't want to and you wipe it's on them.
---
Did the token black guy take the picture?
---
Ahhh, I've never noticed this.
---
Edit: it's an add-on you're using, that makes sense now.
---
Is it possible for a Horde character to go to war with the Forsaken?
---
It's what makes vanilla/classic so great! They turned around and raided up to Darkshire and , not sure it was the same group, but horde raided Stormwind after we left. Just love it !
---
Life is pain as a warrior main. I‚Äôm keeping up because it is getting better but holy crap are early levels rough
---
I would definitely do that, I drink that much without a reason anyway
---
Try binding the raid icons to a key, then Target and hit that key to put a big skull, circle, etc above their head.
---
AND MY AXE
---
In original vanilla i had the main hand and never got the offhand
---
There are always 3 zones you can be levelling in, 1 for each race in your faction. Use them all. Look into Loch Modan, Westfall and Redridge
---
War is only DPS at Blackrock and higher content. Prior to that, it's as Obligatory a tank as rogue is DPS. The choice is an illusion
---
So is frost nova and polymorph
---
Titan Panel it looks like.
---
Agreed, good healers will 100% back you up and not heal DPS like that either, because it's just as stressful for them.
---
Ally hunter and bothered to flair on reddit. Nothing else you need to see
---
Thanks man! Been wondering but haven‚Äôt actually asked anyone. Figured it was time to finally do it
---
I made my bank toon an enchanted so I can just send them over and disenchant them and sell the materials. I‚Äôve been loving it. There are some things I‚Äôll try selling with some luck, mostly ‚Äúof the bear‚Äù and whatnot, you know, the good ones.
---
is it?
---
Yeah it is
---
/w ni hao
---
Political alliances are never simple. I'm sure the argument was that paying the price of a few warriors to take down Arthas was worth it. Look at how fucked up real world politics are, and how factions betray the greater good all the time and yet still end up in the same government together.
---
No matter how much Lady S was pissing off the rest of the Horde, without the strength of her Forsaken the Alliance would have a huge edge on the Horde, and be able to take either apart separately (and happily would).
---
Also explains why the Tauren would side with a faction that had the Horde. The Alliance is a colonizing force, with a corrupt government and a strong thread of fascism. They would happily "liberate" Thunder Bluff given half a chance.
---
Brb. Respeccing feral. No one told me tanking came with pink dwarven sex parties at 4 am.
---
What is it you‚Äôre asking?
---
&gt;It's like me complaining about being asked for water
---
That's not even remotely the same. Now if people asked you to do no dps and only sheep then that would be the same thing. Making water at the beginning of a dungeon is not the same as changing your role entirely in a dungeon group.
---
I agree.
---
When I create pug groups I tell everyone to need all BoE blues and purples.  No one can ninja that way and everyone could use the gold.
---
I don't understand why everyone wants to trust each other all the damn time, everyone needing prevents ninja looting. 
---
But as others have stated, whenever I join other peoples groups, people hit greed on BoEs all the time, so I hit greed as well, but it seems super risky, and I would be pissed if someone ninjaed something worth 50+ gold.
---
Yes, it actually helps me clean up other aspects of the UI by being able to move them up there. It is Titan Panel. 
---
Examples of cleanup - remove all minimap buttons, minimap location, minimap time. Remove need for having bags visible since I can now check how many open slots I have easily. Easily check available ammo/thrown at a glance. I like the gold at a glance as well and it shows me gold on server/other characters on hover which is handy.
---
I could probably turn off things like exp/hr and the addon that suggests and item I can throw away if bags are full.

Well zero would be an inanimate object right so negative IQ would have to be a form of un-intellegence, where in "thinking" actually causes you to un-think.
---
Yeah I'm basically a genius.
---
I'm pretty set on #nochanges, but this is a change I could get behind. Like it was in retail before personal loot, if a BoE was won through a need roll, it became BoP. This stops pretty much all of this "needing for greed" bullshit
---
You're not wrong. The dude's like a real-life caricature of a toxic gamer.
---
My buddy was doing SM runs on repeat as well as farming crimson whelpling pets in wetlands. He made decent exp and made a significant amount of gold doing that. He‚Äôs kind of a nutter for companion pets though. He also got 4 of those dang pets. Depending on your realm they may sell for up to 50g, and will eventually be worth more.
---
There are two opposing factions and neutral enemy NPCs. This is not simply a pve game, because there are two opposing factions.
---
I‚Äôve been raiding for a couple weeks and have tried a few things.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames:  replaces the default raid frames and presents information much better.  You can see health numbers or health missing, have out of range people fade out, and can sort players based on class or group.
---
Cons:  They can be somewhat hard to click.  I‚Äôve found that on occasion, clicking on a player will not register correctly and you‚Äôll dump a heal into the wrong person.
---
Vuhdo: another unit frame replacement.  Very high level of customization.  Allows for programmable one click healing.  You can left click a player‚Äôs frame to cast one heal or right click for another,  all without additional inputs or target switching.  Very useful if you want to have the boss selected at all times so you can monitor your threat meter.
---
Cons: Ugly as sin.  One click healing only seems to support mouse buttons and can‚Äôt be bound to keyboards.  Not a problem for some of the simpler classes, but for a priest there simply aren‚Äôt enough comfortable keybind options.   One click also takes a long time to get used to.
---
Healbot:  haven‚Äôt use it yet but hear it‚Äôs similar to Vuhdo in principle.
---
Dang I have every hotkey slot filled on Hunter, Priest, and Shaman. I'm jelly of this
---
I'm bored again so let's continue this. Can you validate me some more?
---
Myth debunked
---
There's a spot for a weaving priest, and PI/weaving is infinitely more useful than deep shadow.
---
This is true. Agi gives crit armor and dodge in bear form. Str just gives AP.
---
Lotro had a nice farming system.  honestly id prefer some sort of player/guild housing system first in wow.
---
Vanish was broken for a while. They didn't fix it until much, much later (by giving you immunity to everything for about the first second under vanish)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it's not 100% reliable
---
You forgot to cover the time clock, thanks for the account
---
There‚Äôs several ways to break frost nova, including Gnome racial and shapeshift. And you can still use ranged attacks, it‚Äôs also magic and dispelable.
---
Poly can be annoying but it does heal you at an incredible rate so it‚Äôs best as an opener. You can also get immunity from the Deviant pirate/ninja transform I believe.
---
Rogue get stun lock with no real removal. And they can keep it up until you‚Äôre dead. If they don‚Äôt kill you then they can vanish away without an real repercussions.
---
Even as a Mage if I know where they ran off too I can‚Äôt aoe them out of vanish. It‚Äôs bogus.
---
I can handle bad mages, but a lot of the mages I have seen are assholes to boot.   I've had several leave a full UBRS run after they didn't get or got brarthorn.  6 to be exact.  2 in the same run.
---
Daaaaamnü§ò
---
I come from the land of the ice and snow!
---
"l8r retards" - what people think the mage is thinking
---
BRD to 60 or until you get every drop you need, then move to strath scholo lbrs, ubrs at 58-60 depending on your role, tanks should be 60.
---
Itt: people who never played alliance to realize the ways horde has it better.  Yikes.
---
Thanks to this new discovery I've encountered random people in the vicinity yelling AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

while I quest

Story: I‚Äôve been leveling up my fishing, cooking them up, then sending the cooked fish to random warriors around their level ranges. I‚Äôll do some fun note to add some role play lingo, then got this reply back last night. 
---
Hopefully this is part of role play, or if not I‚Äôm glad his family is doing well!

And I didn't say that as well...

Holy shit what if trees are just "unthinkers" ????
---
We have the Federal Bank of Azeroth on my server (Flamelash) only thing they do is beg for gold buy telling us to donate to the federal bank...
---
I looted a chest once and I had a priest pull a whole pack of gnolls and then throw a heal on me to put me in combat and then he faded to drop threat. He even emoted /bye. They all aggroed to me but luckily I‚Äôm a paladin so I just bubbled and they aggroed back to him and he ran away. 
---
People can be so aggressive for the littlest things.  Not everyone on the Internet is friendly.
---
Trust me I tried. She likes the arrows better she says.
---
You don't need to be strategic in lower level dungeons. Just pull and try to aggro as much of it as you can while the mage kites an elite around because they aggroed it.
---
Don't run after mobs unless they're on your healer. Don't taunt mobs off of DPS - save taunt for healer. If they aggro it and think they're a tank then that's on them and their repair cost. Usually I'd end up tanking 2-3 elites while the dps deal with the fourth and then they'd pick off the elites one by one.
---
Fights are much more coordinated in the level 60 dungeons. Up until mara it's pretty much a clusterfuck where you're left wondering why you're even there since they seemingly don't need you. 
---
If DPS are consistently pulling more than your group can handle, and if they don't stop when you ask them to, then just kick them. Especially if they're so selfish that they think that everyone will think it's fun.
---
You don't have to hold all the mobs, just ones attacking me the healer. Chances are better than average that we'll make it through provided that the mage knows what the fuck here is doing.
---
Bonus points if you don't get salty if i drop a pws on you when things get all pear shaped. I noticed that druid tanks almost never get upset about this.
---
There's probably a lot of satisfaction in getting your UI setup just the way you like it but I cannot play WoW without BenikUI.  Next time you feel like tweaking your UI, give it a whirl.  Here is my UI from a week or so ago:
---
https://i.imgur.com/9WYwEEW.jpg
---
In my experience, people will simply trust each other after making sure everyone agrees to the loot rules. Bypassing rules you agree on can get your account red flagged, eventually leading to a ban (depending on how big the offense/ninja is)
---
I'm not getting my account banned over a 20g drop. Also, i'm not going to master loot all of strat until there's an orb drop. Same goes for most people
---
You're a joke lol
---
Correct.
---
Do the scholo quest , which is infront of the dungeon. The offhand is pretty nice, you get at the end of it!
---
Sure, agreed, no teleport besides Warlocks, and definitely no cross realm, that is what killed WoW.
---
I‚Äôm going to need more than just the name to click through and give this a try. Mind dropping a description about what this is?
---
I don‚Äôt care what gear you have as a Warrior - in no way are you ever a laughably OP leveler compared to any other class in Classic.
---
It sounds like when this kid told me Warriors are the easiest character to level.... if you have a pocket leveler. And even then, any other class with a pocket healer would be easier to level than a warrior with one.
---
I enjoy watching someone else play video game whilst hanging out with them. 
---
Other than that no, I‚Äôd rather just play games myself.

It‚Äôs weird how clingy people get about the streamers thy watch. Like cult mentality level of weird.
---
I like my kool aid without cyanide thank you very much.
---
This is literally incomprehensible nonsense
---
I don't really like big streamers, I go for 30-300 viewerish ship, that way you are not alone and the chat isn't too spammy.
---
I mostly watch the ex-private server boys that I know well in advance, but I'd recommend you go to just scroll down under wow and find people of your interests. Like what server class or just try out streams for a bit to see what they are like.
---
Depending on situation orc stun resist can be the better racial :) you can‚Äôt say this is best or this is best because it depends. Fighting another rogue? Orc&gt;ud. Getting charged ? Orc&gt;UD having to deal with a ret? Orc&gt;Ud. Shadowpriest enemy with random stuns and fear cd? Orc&gt;ud. It‚Äôs very depending tbh
---
&gt;	Ackchually
---
You don't have to do all the bosses every run.
---
Uldaman is a huge range, and trash at the start is 11 levels lower than the boss.  
---
Next time just inform the group that you can do the dungeon but probably not the last boss.

---
To be honest, wow is not really that enjoyable to watch. I still watch certain streamers but more for background noise/general banter about the game.
---
Watching someone do MC or BRD for the billionth time gets old fast.
---
They ran ahead and pulled- my fault
---
Tried to taunt them off with 0 rage.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt attack skull first- my fault
---
We died with my threat below that mage.
---
Meh I‚Äôll just grind to 43 and kick his ass
---
Lol there was like 2 pve servers in vanilla and the rest pvp
---
I can't talk for the warrior side of things, but I'm currently a 30 rogue and since lvl 15 I've been capable of pulling 3 mobs my level. 4 if I pop evasion. When I get adrenaline rush and blade flurry things will just be too easy tbh.
---
I just sent this to my friend who had promised to get me smashed for the first time this year. Physically safe environment for me, a fun activity, nobody driving home. 
---
Might do it in live with a BE to Booty.
---
In the hardcore guild community 15 year old PvE content does not matter *at all*. Hardcore guilds do PvE to acquire items tailored towards PvP.
---
lolwut
---
You know most people watch streams while either at work or on their 2nd monitor right?
---
It's not like we are watching streams instead of playing.
---
What is BenikiUI? Is that what gives you the overall look in this screenshot? 
---
I‚Äôve never used one of the prebuilt UIs before. I guess I‚Äôve always liked being able to tweak every aspect and choose each addon. Maybe I‚Äôll check one out next time.
---
Where does this quest start and what's it called to save her?
---
Rolled a tank on the weekend. looking forward to this.
---
That's the one I know, but I think there might be another? I don't remember if Hamuul is sending the Morrowgrain back to Fandral Staghelm, or if they were researching it for Horde purposes.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/blueshamans
---
I didn't figure out that these guys weren't russian until like halfway through the video
---
Just hit 28 been playing since day 1 when I can.
---
I really like Mystical (MW Monk Retail) He is chill and very informative. 
---
Classic streams though.  Tiqqle is chill and funny. 
---
Every now and then Cdew and Tipsout
---
Came here to say, 'add that blood elf asshole in the keep by Ratchet'.
---
Basically so on average, 1-2 out of every 100 guilds that have cleared MC 7 times will get 2 eyes
---
why are here people like ‚Äòsomething must be wrong here‚Äô
---
Get better gear so he can spend even less time in there right? :p
---
Community
---
Says we don't need toxic players, proceeds to be a giant douche.  My point still stands
---
Don‚Äôt listen to the guy who said you‚Äôre not missing out. I liked it a lot for what it was. It wasn‚Äôt amazing but it was enjoyable
---
Archaedas is 47? Wow
---
Totally! Ibuprofen is great for when my knee is giving me bother.
---
I told the to wear a damn condom!
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll have to check some of these. 
---
I‚Äôve seen/heard of Tipsout because of his YouTube content.
---
You could go either 2h fury or arms, probably depends on how much pvp you‚Äôre doing.
---
They think that its somehow related to actual intelligence, and want to think they are smart
---
I hear ya...I ran it with an underleveled group (I don't recall the exact makeup but no one was above 42).  We did fine at the start, stellar in fact, but those big trogs handed us our asses.  
---
We quit in good spirits but it was a brutal ending.
---
I had a lot of fun when Classic launched healing a deadmines group. Most of the group was underleveled and the tank couldn't hit shit. It was pretty fun lol
---
Yeah, but compare it to for example priests. If you have a 60 warrior and you make a priest, will that priest be OP as fuck thanks to some INT gear? Nope. But when you gear up a warrior or a rogue, you make leveling so simple it's just silly. And they are both fine without gear too.
---
Example: leveling a rogue now. In WC I did 40% of the party dmg. The 2 mages don't have spell power yet, so they are useless. In BFD I had dealt about 100k when the shaman and cat druid were at 30k. It's bonkers.
---
Aaaa 2?
---
Gesundheit.
---
It appears to be a classic attitude kek
---
Just type /roll 100-100 and hope nobody notices.
---
It‚Äôs a matter of mindset over spec. I tank just fine as a Fury. But I play tanks in practically every MMO I‚Äôve played.
---
Dungeon finder in retail will also cross realm you, so you end up in groups with randoms from other servers you will never see again. It has it's ups and downs but is something most classic players find ruins the social aspect of the game. You'd often get groups who do not say a single word to each other and with everything in retail being AOE friendly it's just smash through with no breaks as fast as possible.
---
The bpaptu numeral üòÇ
---
Just chilling running around from Desolace to Shimmering Flats to SM to Arathi on my way from 30-40.
---
Had some frustrating PvP times in Hillsbrad as Horde so I'm avoiding STV for now.
---
Tempted to start leveling a druid or warrior to tank, but sticking with my priest for now.
---
Just joined a guild, which I never did before, and am looking to get into the social aspects of the game.
---
Nope, fished up a box that requires 250 and I‚Äôm pretty sure there is indeed a 275 one too.
---
There is literally a guard right beside the guy being attacked it amazes me how stupid you people are.
---
Because that chain is how you get Aqual Quintessence which you need to douse the runes in Molten Core.
---
Why not both?
---
That's not what I said at all, it does suck that the healer has to work a little bit harder, but the alternatives are for mobs to run around everywhere and everyone wipe, or you spend hours replacing dps on top of dps until you find 3 that act right.
---
I can keep threat right off with a Whirlwind that usually procs a Bladestorm on Ravager that makes the healer have to heal harder, or... I can use a shield and the DPS pull threat before I have the chance to even get the mobs in place, making the shield a moot point. 
---
The DPS, in this specific situation are the absolute problem, but there's nothing we can do about them since most of them refuse to listen, what we can do is change the way we play ourselves though. We can use Ravagers as a tank, and work harder as a healer to make up for them. It's not fair, it's just what we have to do.
---
100 runs is nothing, this dude is crazy lucky.  I've done close to 100 and i haven't even seen gorosh once.
---
Yea I‚Äôd recommend if your gonna tank to at least be 44 if you plan to go to the last boss. Buuggers hit HARD... 
---
My healer carried me big time.
---
how's the stormshroud armor for rogues? I like the idea of being able to potentially use my leatherworking to create a set that could be viable for PVE at endgame
---
I don't have audio on my work terminal so I can only hope your vid featured some MGS sneaking music.
---
Reading super hard is it mate?
---
Ok we‚Äôre definitely done now, explaining things I‚Äôve already explained to idiots is boring. You have a good one.
---
blizz keeps track of AH sales like that too
---
iirc some guy got banned for it on accident
---
As someone who tanked all dungeons while levelling, my rule of thumb was to be no lower than -3 levels below the final boss. -4 levels and more seems to make a significant difference in damage/hit rate for non-hunters that you may instead just be boosted, but at -3 I was able to hold aggro (mostly) constantly.
---
It meant I was overlevelled for some of the earlier areas in some dungeons, but it meant I needed just one visit for quests.
---
Hunters and paladins can use Obsidian Edge Blade. But he just said warrior dps roll

i posted preraid alternatives that are nice. in general t0 is a good starting point, you are looking for stam/int mostly, preferably with some spelldamage. the occasional cloth piece won't do much harm, but it shouldnt be all your gear. Necropile Set is also a good alternative, but i personally don't like wearing that much cloth, but  thats just me, its not really that bad, i just dont like it.
---
well you look on wowhead the potential spawn for black lotus, and then simply work your way arround with farsight, i dont know how else to explain it :D your minimap is showing the place where you have farsighted so its very convenient with herb tracking.
---
Im on Kurinnaxx
---
if he's needing on everything he's obviously a ninja. I just kick these people and 4 man it.
---
I'm level 40 this time around and haven't felt like I needed to grind. As people say, quests are grinds. I've even skipped zone.
---
How do you do that
---
Prebis warriors and warlocks are already threatcapped in Onyxia unless your guild is using nonstandard strategies. As such, the neck, which is very valuable to tanks due to having 1% hit that is scarce in plate, is no doubt better in the long run. It's not even a question of deep prot versus dual wield tanking, the neck is just better.
---
That said, if your guild has no dps warriors and warlocks or they don't plan to get (pre)bis, then there is no problem.
---
So post the whole screenshot then.
---
anytime bud
---
retardedly good at the game you mean, surely?
---
When you have something constructive to say I will listen. For now I demote you to the wall of shame on the fight club discord, plebian.
---
Is warlock or rogue less gear dependent? I'm trying to decide which to main, especially considering I don't have as much time to run dungeons all the time to get the best gear
---
Poor mage down on his luck, lost all the loot rolls to a hunter probably
---
Deleted
---
More fails like this need to be posted. To realistically set expectations.
---
I see the problem. You spelled it wrong. The A in AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA goes before the A not after.
---
lmao
---
That is not... remotely the same logic.  Did you eat off of led plates growing up?
---
Depends on what type of warrior you are if you are arms with slow two handed you can easily be top dps and hold aggro. If you are sword and board then good luck holding aggro. Anything else is still weak.
---
Grats. People are reacting the same way with warriors getting Hand of Ragnaros. Play how you want.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blacksmithing-classic-wow-1-300#master-axesmith
---
This might help you out mate. Best of luck!
---
But it's like he's in both camps at once. He insults him for being a mage, and then he insults him because he *isn't* farming at the most optimal area.
---
Why doesn't this guy just go to the best area then?
---
If I recall correctly, DW doesn‚Äôt outscale 2H fury until AQ
---
I'm more likely to tip 69s to a rogue that doesn't charge than pay 33s for one that charges that.
---
Hunters with OEB make melee cry, and we're Horde obvi.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Not sure how to answer this. 
---
-	What server are you on?
---
-	What faction do you play?
---
-	What are you looking for in a guild? Lots of active players? Leveling buddies? Raiding? PvP? A certain time schedule? 
---
There are tons of things people can be looking for when they are searching out a guild. 
---
I happened to find my guild on my server‚Äôs discord.
---
I sinned and descended into the realm of trivial posts, may Lord have mercy.
---
The amount of classes who have sleep, charm, or fear out numbers those that stun. Charge stun is not going to end things for a solid player. Arguing that it helps protect you sometimes from a shadow priest sometimes stunning you also is weak imo. By the numbers, it is strictly better. Everyone can argue specific circumstances all they want, but that is a losing game.
---
2 hours is pretty fast. I got this mace today too and it took closer to 4 hours because we had no flight paths
---
Yea I was a prot paladin... I imagine a warrior could have been able to do it.
---
Let him run around with 7k mana xD
---
Just got to level 30 over the weekend. Pretty happy as I can now user travel form to get around quicker on my Druid. But at the end of the day I am. Just enjoying the journey,  not in any big hurry to get to 60.
---
Too bad you should vendor it according to Auctioneer
---
I've tanked Uldaman as level 42, and it worked out all right because I am extrenely experienced at playing warrior, and we had a good group.
---
I wouldn't recommend anyone under 44 try it. Generally the tank needs to be a lot higher level than DPS and healers if you want a pleasant eun.
---
The important part is you realized your mistake.
---
I hate that shamans are pink
---
Started laughing before it started playing,  saw the Gnomer elevator and knew exactly what was about to happen. Expected it to be the PoV Dwarf though.
---
I Wana level a pallydin but all these tank posts making me reconsider rolling warrior.
---
Truthfully I want to support Bright because I think more movies appealing to urban fantasy fans need to get made
---
That's a supper good number. I'm going to remember that.
---
just missing is another guy doing the yell and getting a 95
---
Absodefinitely, And just drain tank everything with succubus and her abilities turned off. You'll almost never have to rec while leveling doing this. 
---
Hell, im not even running ruin at 60, im running SM/DS which i feel is awesome, im never close to performing badly in dungeons and it makes solo grinding way easier, especially Mara.
---
me too, thanks.
---
I'll have to get my landscape oriented phone first
---
My pally nickname is Arkenos. lol
---
I just edited in my faction and server I didn't think about that.
---
Also I'm going to look for a guild with an active discord.
---
Thank you!
---
That crazy Papa Smurf
---
If people just trade me I hand them a bottle of bleach
---
Got to 52 then the new Destiny 2 expansion came out. been a week, still 52...
---
If they‚Äôre smart Warriors they‚Äôre blasting through quests because they‚Äôre only doing green quests or because they‚Äôre grouped up.
---
If they‚Äôre doing their level yellow quests though? They‚Äôre not blasting through them then.
---
Quests above their level? Lol have fun with grave runs.
---
Oh I'm in the camp of mages being the new huntards. But just like the hunters of old, not everyone is a dumbass.
---
If you go hunter you can do Diremaul solos for even better money come phase 2
---
im having the same conflict lol its been going so smooth but that shadow form looks so tempting lol but what if i start getting down time cause il loose all my disc talents and i don't think il be as viable in dungeons....i hate DPS priests in dungeons......should have rolled a mage or warlock if you want to dps in a dungeon.
---
I tried it today too. Lost 2 sweet blues
---
No shortage of business /shrug
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until your significant other walks in the room with a confused look on their face, admitting that two hours of Barrens chat about whether hotdogs should be considered sandwiches, and whether intimacy with a Kolkar centaur is bestiality or not has completely disintegrated their brain.  
---
Don‚Äôt roll Alliance for the pretty start zones or races - roll Alliance to avoid Barrens chat. And the running. Oh god, the running.
---
Could have been longer, it was his first time and I'd done it before so I was just having fun and running along. 2 hours was a guesstimate lol
---
What shoulders are those?
---
After every mob then yeah they‚Äôre definitely doin something wrong. But you basically have to stop every 3-5 mobs to eat/heal or wait a while between pulls.
---
So thirsty
---
I downvoted you.
---
i think so, he has a specific male target it seems
---
Well I have lots of Preraid healing haha. guess I gotta heal my way to elemental lol!
---
I do love to PVP and am very heart broken that deep resto I just get fucked lol. 
---
I appreciate you taking the time with me as I am a newb to the ways of the shaman lol.
---
I cant look at the links currently because my work has all the good stuff blocked. but I will look when im off tonight. 
---
Thanks again. I think I will give this a try. Hopefully my healing dosnt tank to much.
---
Shamans are branch managers. They can yrande or into good bois.
---
At level 40 deviates stop being horde only tbh
---
Actually no.  This happened to me crafting for someone and reloading didn't work but relogging did.
---
When you're tanking in dungeons, you never see how other tanks do it for you to compare and learn.  Alkaizer has been a good warrior tank streamer.
---
TBH if you get a CC proc, it's the most mana efficient spell for 2 enemies.
---
The mage hate is generally from pissy players that think random mages owe them water. If I‚Äôm on I am normally doing something to be asked to make water for the hundred randoms in the world whispering is too much imo. Sure if I‚Äôm doing absolutely nothing I‚Äôll make some water for someone. If their in my dungeon they get food or water or both of whatever quantity. I usually set myself to dnd everyday now with either sorry I‚Äôm busy and I get cursed out about how lazy of an asshole I am or I set it to something like 1g a stack of food/water 3g for portals because I know no one will take that and it lets me figure out who to put on ignore when they call me a greedy asshole. And yes being cursed out for not making water for randoms is a daily occurrence as a mage that‚Äôs busy a majority of the time.
---
For EsfandTV ,Asmongold and MOONMOON, I really like their character, they‚Äôre funny and easy to watch. I‚Äôve watched qt (imaqptie) for awhile now because I‚Äôm a long time league of legends fan and equally enjoy his wow content as well
---
I'd rather have queues than layering or dead realms
---
None of that takes away from what he said.
---
They didn‚Äôt say a shuffle doesn‚Äôt have a time cost.
---
And finding price differences between raw and completed items is a process.
---
If playing the AH was an easy game then gold would never be an issue for anyone. But playing the AH isn‚Äôt an easy game.
---
You found a shuffle of some sort? Guess what - you‚Äôre more than likely competing against several other players who came across the same shuffle.
---
Making gold will always have a time cost so I‚Äôm not sure why you even included that as though it takes away from anything.
---
that takes a ton of mana too.
---
How's the hangover?
---
It is not.
---
You are defending yourself to everyone after posting something to try and seek validation
---
hes right, enchanters arent anyones personal butler.
---
When u're playing as dru u're either "that cool guy" who tanks and heals and innervates and all that stuff at the same time while leveling an alchemy alt, or u're either melee oomkin type of druid.
---
[Except they kinda already did it.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=128427/murkidan)
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Dirty Horde, clean yourself up with this
---
/spit
---
You go to rachet at lvl 15-28ish, you dont need to go stv at that level.
---
Now there are two of them!
---
Or we have grouped with shitty mages and thus it has some support behind it?
---
Someone should tip that warlock
---
Lol it has nothing to do with cooldowns. It has to do with unimpressive clips, of which mages can produce a lot of. Some triggered mages eh
---
Silly question. When in a melee group I have heard that you just spam rank 1 chain heal. 
---
Is this true?
---
Yeah the grass changes in Mulgore are weird with max clutter
---
"Laughs in Classic"
---
That's when ya just spam sunders till they land because there is no damage component just to threat for landing it.
---
I leveled a paladin and am now working on a hunter. Hunter is ridiculous. I can usually kill mobs 5 levels above me no problem. On pally one level above me was a slog, 2 levels was risky. I'm not sure how everything maths out but a large part of it is that the hunter is not running into the same miss, dodge, parry, resist issues the pally always runs into.
---
I just watch Joana these days. He doesn't talk much, but does answer chat. So most of the time its just the in game music, and sound of his bow. I find it really soothing to listen to.
---
the mage's role is dps, do you make hunters kite stuff for you before/after the dungeon?
---
Because the main betrayal, was Varimathras betraying Slyvanas, not her betraying the horde.
---
Their is no guild bank in Classic. So in Classics case, no. His bank guild is a conglomerate of users who made an alt to bank with.
---
So they can leave the alt by an AH and just send valuable items to the alt instead of having to disrupt their questing and go to a main city on their main character to facilitate the transactions.
---
Sounds good in some respects, but surely it's awful for handling all the green loot that drops in dungeons?
---
Would be annoyed as fuck if I can't roll on any greens that no one needs just because I'm a clothy.

Yeah I think it sounds really cool to. For me, my main allure to WoW has always been the economy within it.

Badly. If you are gathering mobs and frostbite procs you‚Äôll have to wait up for them to catch up. If you are Blizzarding mobs and it procs, you will have mobs outside of the blizzawding aoe frwquently
---
Need before greed definitely has its place, no disrespect meant toward the group loot system.  It‚Äôs just frustrating to have people rage quit because they wanted need before greed, but not the rules that come along with having that system.
---
I mean, the alternative to democracy is absolute tyranny so... it's probably best to put up with idiots.
---
This is just wrong, you spend 4 points on hemo because you need the shitty pre req. You take imp SS because its that or 2 points of dodge, which is garbage. Also, 5 energy makes almost no difference because your energy regens in blocks of 20. The four points to get hemo are better spent elsewhere, which is why 99% of builds skip hemo.
---
I mean, to be fair to him you are higher level and AOE farming. Some zones I've gone in to to level all the mobs are gone from people AOE farming and it can be very frustrating.
---
You had me at Dwarf Sex Party.
---
Pallys and druids are by far the best off-tanks tanks. Druid, especially, are my favourite offtank.
---
they arent rocks
---
they're minerals
---
Question with that, y would you want all the succ abilities turned off?
---
I asked one dude in Tanaris for a portal to IF. He also offered it to me for free. Then he accidentally teleported and he had his hearthstone on CD so he just logged out for the day. Worst I‚Äôve felt in this game so far... I even managed to find a lock to summon him but he went offline before I got the chance to tell him.
---
Showing off the shadoweave set i think.
---
Its so weird fighting one mob and looking up and a mage is constantly fighting 3 at a time.
---
Does anyone even fuck with the tiny tusks on trolls?  All I see are the big pointy bois.
---
What level are you? I hear people in the 30s and 40s are having a nightmare of a time in many aspects of the game, whereas people in the high 50s and 60 had a really smooth experience.
---
Bads being bad 2.0
---
Ziqo -mage, AWC caster
---
Cdew - shaman, blizzcon bby
---
Venruki - mage, AWC caster
---
moO_UK - APES main tank
---
KungenTV - Nihilum MT vanilla OG 
---
Hydramist - APES classy R1 priest
---
All of these are for gameplay but they‚Äôre also incredibly informative and some of the best at their classes
---
Except for when people are rolling against my epics in a raid. Then it's every damn time.
---
I literally have a three part macro that I use at th start of tanking an instance. Anyone has a problem with it I am happy to leave and they can wait another 45 minutes for another tank.
---
A counter point to this. I main warrior with a lock alt. When I start to pull aggro I stop wanding/draining that mob and swap to something else. But my dots will keep ticking regardless. I can't stop them from ticking, and unless the tank gets more threat then I'll pull aggro. So its not *always* the DPS fault if they get aggro.
---
It looks like he ate all of Philadelphia
---
Probably you are just bad.
---
It can be rough.  I'd suggest finding a chill guild you can run with and always try having a friend in your 5 man group.  Even if there's someone being a tool, having someone to whisper and commiserate with can make it way more fun.
---
Also, don't be afraid to lay down the law.  Tanks are seen as leaders so often you gotta just put a rampaging dps down a peg or two.

For all those wondering, here are the clothes!

"Shit Blizzards, Randy."
---
This is genius
---
I was thinking this too.
---
not every mage can consistently make 50g p/h in ZF
---
it can be quite difficult, and even streamers attempting it are wiping so much that it's not really worth it in the end. you need the right spec and gear that's high in int/sta rather than the pre-bis list everyone else is walking around in.
---
a lot of things can go wrong. eg 1 mob resists a nova and it's over if you don't have a 10 minute cooldown up. mob running through blizzard because of spell-batching. pat runs through and ruins your day. graves despawning. 
---
with essences there is close to zero chance of you dying and if you get 3-4 an hour then boom you've matched ZF farming (at its absolute best) without the hassle.
---
Note: not mine
---
Without trying to sound too cocky I raided in top 20 guilds for quite a while and players at this level will definitely spend gold on this. People at that level of play LOVE flexing on other players to let them know they're better than them at the game. Dropping fortunes of gold on rare items/mounts and shit like that is the name of the game. These people are probably spending so much time farming/leveling that the gold for an incredibly rare hard to get item is nothing.
---
Thanks
---
Have fun spamming "LF1M Tank then GTG" for 2 hours at lv 60 because your shitty attitude and lack of respect is what's running all the tanks off. It's not worth the headache babysitting bads like you.

Im living all the tpb memes in this sub lately

Backstab or there would be no point in being daggers.

I'm a woman, dude.  But my husband and I visiting different websites doesn't mean we don't enjoy the same games a lot.
---
Same boat, brought all mine to Arcanite Reaper. No issues really.
---
I'm pretty disappointed by this, too. I get that the exalted AB rewards are pretty strong, but it's not worth delaying the best BG in the game.
---
Brb making a tank

Now I want to start a bank alt guild called "the iron bank".

Nice, thanks!

No shit

Nope. Have had this same problem ~5 times in classic. Reloading doesn't work, have to relog.

Ironic

Your comment inspired me to check, and on Whitemane horde they're all 550g+

Is there a relationship between 'The Boys' and 'Me and the Boys' ? I used to be in the boys but the guild Beef did me a great service to where I couldn't refuse their guild offer. --Gaskevin

---
For sure lol
---
yeah that must be it
---
Idk why but that seems to be the only dungeon that gets lvl 38-42 DPS thinking they can complete the dungeon
---
Uldaman is the one big example of a dungeon having a hilariously bad level range. The early mobs are like 36-38, but then the final boss is 47. Blizzard didn't think this one through.
---
Most other dungeons don't have anywhere near this level of level difference.
---
50 gold lol no sorry
---
That's the Defias Messenger. The Defias Traitor is the escort quest guy that spawns in Sentinel Hill and runs up to Moonbrook, then walks to the barn where DM's entrance is.
---
Funniest shit happened to me today. My little 36 pally is running to SM and some Sweaty 60 warlock sees me and decides to chase me down past the zepplin. He tries dotting me but i just bubble and hit him with the magic dust i bought from the AH. Sleeps him for 30s while i chug a swift pot and book it. He was FURIOUS and spent the next half hour ganking alliance in SM. Of course none of the horde there could touch me cause i just bubbled.
---
Oh, that is kinda cool.

---
You should stop looking at dps and start looking at actual damage done lol. Recount doesn't account for downtime, which is 100% relevant.

RNGesus decided you had enough to eat already. You know, he always likes to think he knows better.

But he doesn't. Next time, invoke the true lord, Lootcifer.

I've never seen this and im so happy you linked it! Thanks!
---
Loved that the hunter is in the back.
---
Or after buffing half a 5-man.
---
There‚Äôs nothing to discuss.  The mage hate is primarily a reddit circlejerk.  Nobody at 60 is disappointed to have a good mage in their party.  You‚Äôre enjoying the class.  Be a proud Frostard.
---
Would this be viable for leveling if you wanted to tank a lot? Or still better to go arms?
---
Yup he gets it üòè
---
u/LumpySkull is my bottom boi toy and he gets it every night from my dom alpha top ass üòè
---
Save rage at the end of pulls.
---
If you want to live like the min/max era in the warrior discord it‚Äôs 2h axes all the way. The 5%crit from axe spec is way better than the procs from sword spec and mace spec. Gator bite is nice (I used WW Axe until it dropped for me in Mara) but the real 2h tanking boost comes when you get Dreadforge Retaliator from BRD, the extra crit and parry will carry you right up until you need to respec prot or fury for raids
---
Oof, forgot to censor that
---
verycoolguy666. also known as satansheterofather, also known as lvl 8 paladin king. i love watching him pvp. when he quests i tune out. He sure found a great way to distinguish himself from the rest of the rabble.
---
I watched that more times than I should have. And laughed more than I should have! 
---
Falling... fallling...  RED HEALTH!!!
---
There are not enough PvP resto talents in the resto tree to warrant not going 31/0/20 as shaman. 
---
All important talents are in the beginning of the resto tree (totem mana reduction, +3hit, +crit) while the most important elemental talent is deep down (casting time reduction for your damage abilities).
---
I'm parched
---
Sorry, bit Smolderweb has the TRUE "Me and the Boyz" Guild.
---
im fucking keeping bleach on me now you are the fucking best dude üòÇ
---
as horde it compares very well.  Completely viable to just use the stratlive sword and go from there, maybe getting an arcanite reaper if you suddenly get money. As 2h fury you don't actually slam very much, you mostly just burn your rage on hamstrings to fish for windfury.
---
It's actually better than that because you are rolling 5 different numbers. The first person who rolls doesn't have to do exactly say 32. They could roll any of the 5 numbers. Next person can roll any of the remaining 4 numbers and so on
---
I believe the odds of ops situation are 1 in 83,333,333 (this is assuming we want those specific 5 numbers. If we want any 5 numbers in sequence the odds increase quite a bit and is slightly more complex.  First number doesn't matter then person 2 has 8 numbers they can roll (4 in either direction then it decreases person but you also have to factor in the odds of the first person rolling a number that doesn't have +-4 numbers from it (like 99)
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
Quick question: Two bored Alliance are currently camping the Orgrimmar gates on my (PvP) server. Is there any way I, as a lvl 45 Druid, can somehow aggro Saurfang onto them, or ruin their fun some other way?
---
yeah, Chain i use rank 3. But my other heals I have stepped down 3 times.
---
horde can go 2h fury, both dw and 2hand is viable on horde.
---
Hunter question: should I upgrade my arrows?  I have been using the 10 coopers one. ...
---
Because the succubus abilities cost mana, and the whole point of using Dark Park + Succubus is to use her mana as your own. She deals a lot of damage with auto-attacks alone!
---
These pretzels are making me thirsty
---
No one ever whispers me for a group on the same continent. Its always the farthermost possible place from me.
---
17 20 55 4 20 69

what is this, lost?
---
A holy human paladin on bloodsail buckaneers has it. I can't recall his name though..
---
Lol I killed like 10 today in tanaris
---
Lol dope editing.
---
Explained perfectly
---
That‚Äôs true. Easy as in not dying and low down time. I‚Äôm sure other classes are having a hoot. That said, often when I group up with people for quests my avg xp/hr goes down quite a bit - casters are always drinking, people not really grinding. I dunno
---
You sound like you play a Shaman on Faerlina
---
Blizzard has done their best to train it out of people.
---
Desolace chat has had more and more "Where's Rexxar?" being asked every week as more people are hitting 60.
---
I would be surprised if that wasn't considered hardcore by most players. When we're talking ~50% of your time is spent at least logged in, whatever the reason or circumstance, you're 'bout that life. Anyways, I'm jealous.
---
Mine prefers the mouse, with the other in her lap... I'm trying, alright!
---
After 1st one it‚Äôs a boot from group and ignore or youre complicit.
---
i've been running from Darkshire and Westfall.
---
Too real. Just gave me flashbacks of ressing in a BG and having to buff myself then drink back up before I can rejoin the fight. That reminds me, my "one change" is definitely the resource buff from retail for GYs in BGs...
---
It has already changed the whole meta for all the best warriors.
---
Right now the meta has changed to people capping at 6% hit(yellow hitcap is 6% at 305+weaponskill), and using a start and stop heroic strike macro so they basically have heroic strike queued at all times and take it off right before autos if they can't spare the rage. Hit essentially became a useless stat since 6% is really easy to get.
---
It's crazy how overpowered this strategy is, already massively changing the game. Also it's a bug. It was always unintentional but it was never discovered/fixed before wrath, so for whatever reasons the idiots at blizzard has decided to keep it in.
---
Watch out guys he's fully prebis!
---
did that the other day! dug it.
---
why y'all not playing the game now
---
like you had whole summer to meet up
---
It's all the stupid quests that turn green by the time you even have a chance at damaging that last boss.
---
I get no fun to kill some random player who can barely fight back.
---
It ia quite sad that somebody needs their opponent be fighting mobs and be low health/mana to be able to win.
---
Bumping into opponenr and start fighting? Thats fine and fun. I mean those that wait for you to start killing mobs before deciding to attack you
---
Who caaaaaaaaaaresssss
---
It hurts dad it hurts
---
You should learn what the F key does.
---
&lt;laughs in stubborn&gt;
---
In retail I‚Äôd make a new character on a new server, walk to orgrimmar, vendor my starter gear for like 4 coppers, and use that to place bids. My wealth would grow, and eventually I‚Äôd reach gold cap on a level 1 on a server.
---
Halt must be one since an alliance shouted it clearly to my horde character last night in stv
---
1 too many A‚Äôs
---
Do you know what a shitbolt is bubs?
---
Probably because he's not stupid enough to give a huge upgrade out as a stat stick.
---
Is this the comedian, Demetri Martin?
---
I tried to tell a pug group that when we started (I'm the healer). They proceeded to mock me for being a know it all and asking me where to go and stuff. I told them I heal, I follow the group staring at health bars and knowing we can't clear the final boss has nothing to do with knowing the layout of the map.
---
Fast forward some time and group wipes instantly on final boss. The 2 mocking me left group without a word.
---
Moral of the story, if someone says "Just to set expectations, we probably won't be downing the boss" don't take it as some insult. It's simply seeing the levels and how fast your clearing the opening trash and knowing the boss is too much for the group.
---
I'm a poor orc warrior that hit level 41 and got my mount and I can't foresee myself getting axe of the deep woods or flurry axe anytime soon as I have to focus funds on getting devilsaur set. Will it be better if I use heavy 2 handers if I'm planning to raid as fury? Until I have money to buy those axes, also any recommendations on how to earn money as a orc warrior that has engi/mining?
---
God I love gay rights
---
4 or 5 years i think
---
Nope, he just roams around Kalimdor and lives in the wilds. See that rock? It's his pillow.
---
That doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that he did actually do a good thing
---
Yep. Huge damage upgrade.
---
I'm content with being close to BiS preraid with a few missing pieces. 
---
Still rocking the royal decorated chest from BRD because I'm not down to arena grind and always lose on the cadaverous chest in Scholo. 
---
Got a lot of my gear from start pretty easy. Mara ring, devilsaur set  and UBRS trinket dont take much effort. My second trinket is a simple +8 resistant trinket, really not down to grind BRD for 20 attack power. 
---
Things I got lucky with are the Baron cape, the hit bracers from LBRS, took about 7 UBRS runs for truestrike shoulders and Eye of Rend. 
---
Been lazy and havent got the amulet from the Plagueland questline.

Don't pallies not have a taunt?
---
Technically, since it happened, 100%.
---
I've been leveling as resto and the amount of thank you messages I've gotten just for tossing a heal to someone who needs it is pretty nice.
---
I'd say build into the feral tree first as it's much faster for leveling.  Going resto is fine but you'll ruin into the same problems all healers do leveling where you're weaker outside of dungeons.

You buy the materials for less then 10s per 1 of each item combined and make a profit vendoring them. Had 200g by 40. Was awesome
---
Duuuude.... no.. just no.. you literally unbound of the most useful things you have. This is like making tab no longer change targets dude.
---
Honestly me and my partner came across our guild while leveling. 2 people from the guild were in the area and helped us along with a quest. Turns out one of them was the leader and offered that the guild was always accepting invites if we wanted to join. We left our current "dead" guild and gave it a shot. We don't do a lot of talking in the guild itself (I do a bit more than my partner) but they are all very friendly and have a discord that they're always on. I think you're best bet is to just keep trying guilds until you eventually find one that feels right, we went through 2 others before arriving at the one we're in now.
---
im afraid it may be to late for that.
---
Blaumeux is the most balanced 50-50 server with a good population. Unfortunately that is Pacific timezone.
---
I love responding to toxic whispers with kindness.
---
"Thank you for your helpful advice! Have a blessed day!"
---
F
---
Thats just the contents on your left boot
---
&gt;Moral of the story? Do good and good will come for you.
---
So am I karmically boned because I spent an hour on my rogue ganking horde at the two alliance npc spots in Hillsbrad and stunlocking them so they'd get killed by NPC's causing equipment damage? If so, worth it. Most fun i've had in classic WoW.
---
loool fair enough
---
What spec are you running? Mind posting it? Or what the end spec will look like? After leveling feral (I‚Äôm 45 currently) I CANT WAIT to get into balance for a nice change of pace.
---
Also I see some people skip boom kin form after reaching the bottom and just moving over to resto. What‚Äôs your opinion on that?
---
I am happy to get anything so it doesn't matter much to me.  10s for any lockboxes you get toward the late game are definitely not gonna be a loss though.
---
Not lying, that chest piece is a rare drop first off, off a boss that is also rare, it's super likely to be true.
---
I feel you on those things, I still think in WoW you can get your day ruined just by questing in barrens and reading general chat lol.
---
Should be a requirement to join a group.
---
it's nice to have the mana cost in combat because it forces decision making, but out of combat just wastes time.
---
Fify: god I love gays, right?!
---
I meant ignoring mid dungeon. But even outside of it I have never put someone on ignore. I really should though.
---
And never get anything done because if an Ally is on your quest/farm spot, you have literally zero recourse.
---
Even if you're absolutely terrible at PVP and you get wrecked each time, just making them kill you over and over might be enough to make them give up and go away because they can't get anything done efficiently either.
---
Yup. That's why I wouldn't want it reduced, just the graveyard buff to make it so you're not wasting like 30s ressing then another 30s buffing and drinking again. It's a pain.
---
I did this shit in undercity this weekend lol, nostalgia really hit me then!
---
&gt; it would not be hard to obtain one
---
   
---
We only ever saw one Bonereaver's Edge drop. We saw something like seven Eyes in the same amount of time.
---
The old people can't fuck me if I fuck them first mentality.
---
This happened in vanilla too.
---
Here's a though.  People get sketchy because of people like you.
---
If it's red it's DEAD! :D
---
They just refer to group loot as need before greed because of player accepted loot rules for choosing need or greed.  No one actually wants loot rules set to that, takes a lot of gold away from clothie types if warriors get to greed up every type of item that clothie can't use just to vendor it all.
---
Wayment
---
fk u.. only 36
---
It turns deep red by 6am
---
Nah, it's not red.
---
That's a Warlock? Mages get slow fall, the grand master of all spells.
---
I did deadmines to see if I could solo it and turned the linen into bags that I gave to people lower level. It‚Äôs not much but at single digit levels I imagine four bag gifts equal love.
---
Wrong for the exact reason you mentioned. Using is more useful than selling. If you can‚Äôt see my point above about needing everything if it‚Äôs just value then that‚Äôs on you man. There is a difference between the usefulness of the item and it‚Äôs neutral value as an economic term. BoP highlights this. You wouldn‚Äôt be a dickhead and need a BoP because you can‚Äôt even use it, but you could need it and sell it for gold. And yet that‚Äôs your exact same argument for needing on an item that‚Äôs the abomsute best in class upgrade for a class just because you can sell it and get more money than vendorinv it. It‚Äôs literally just the upgrade in money to you from the value as a bop vs a BoE that makes you feel like your entitled to the gold that comes from it because it‚Äôs that much more valuable. 
---
Let me ask you this. What is your stance on BoE greens? Let me guess, you let ppl upgrade on those and don‚Äôt roll need. Know why? Because they‚Äôre innately less likely to make gold for you, even though you could sell them all the same. It‚Äôs a greedy, self centered view you and those that share your view have. Atleast accept it. Pretending like it‚Äôs not is literally just blissful ignorance.
---
It's alright man. I can rebind it to something else.
---
Absolutely terrible. Add this guy to the blacklist.
---
Having an easuer time tanking as a pally honestly. AoE threat on happy dps is imoossible mission
---
Here's a thought, people VERY OFTEN roll need immediately on boe epics and expensive patterns.  They do it without saying a thing.  Unless you talk about it before you start the instance.  Stop acting like you're so altruistic and perfect.
---
Lol huntard 2019‚Ñ¢
---
You're missing the distinction between party members and random people.
---
Party members get free ports (and water/food), just like your party members get free heals.
---
But if random people in the world start whispering you and demanding you heal them, are you just gonna do that for free for all of 'em, with a smile on your face?
---
?  
---
It's still like this in Retail.
---
So far at lvl 30 I have found 1 single piece of gear with int &amp; str which is a cloak. I have found zero mail greens with int. The pieces do exist but it‚Äôs not realistic to think you will be decked out with them unless you get really lucky or spend gold buying off the AH. I myself try not to buy too much gear off the AH while leveling.
---
I'm trying to be a peaceful, nature loving Hamuul wannabe, why you gotta do that to me?
---
Pour one out for the homie
---
I'll have to get some sound effects just in case I make another video!
---
Same
---
Ok actually need before greed just sounds like the default but apparently its not
---
This was posted a few weeks ago, should help you out.

Gratz on the ‚Äúsex‚Äù
---
He's for the horde version of raid attunements.
---
The other day I saw an ally struggle with an elite that I knew was for a quest so I helped kill it. When it died I let the gnome loot it. He thanked me and then I fire blasted the gnome killing it.
---
Yeah, his tone was super helpful. I'm sure he was concerned about OP's profit.
---
I gagged
---
Hey, as a skinner i think tauren and all druids should be skinnable, and gnomes should be lootable for cooking mats.
---
You can have them both enabled at the same time but they act completely independantly.  
---
If you download the TSM app to sync data you do your GetAll scans with Auctionator.
---
Also, thank you for using Auctionator, I love buying items under vendor price.
---
Im trying to get into this but it feels like im doing something wrong :(
---
Im leveling a druid, level 11 now, and I can't do any of my quests. I can kill 1 creature at a time and it uses ALL MY MANA, so then I have to sit there and wait
---
and if two creatures at once attack, im screwed. Yet I see some people around my level take 2 or 3 enemies at once.
---
I don't know what to do.. it's not fun to just struggle and die every 5 minutes..
---
removed for low effort in 3...2....
---
Lol, jeez. Talk about an overreaction
---
You'd be better off farming a different spot if you would prefer something more efficient. I appreciate what you're doing!
---
Play the game the way it was intended I guess?
---
&gt; My bf recently got me into it and im loving it. Im a druid night elf. Going to start making potions soon! I hope she enjoys it :)
---
hey wait a sec...
---
This post is def me. Im level 41 and have yet to ask a mage for food or buy any from a vendor.
---
If you do anything in life for the sake of ego. Or to gain image. You are doing life wrong.
---
Go play the game, have fun, study that shit and excel in all parts.
---
Why the fuck did you have it set to that?
---
I mean it probably takes a lot longer to pound 12 beers than to take 4 shots.
---
I tanked this place at 40 and he was the only boss i couldnt kill, pull him to the top of the stairs and just taunt on cd. Ezpz. If youre alliance bring a pally for BoS everyone but you for it.
---
And it's sad that you think you are entitled to a drop because a web site said it was your BiS.  Fuck actual upgrades, amirite?  Or pvp gear. Or grinding at max level
---
Game is bugged I can't skin centaurs and quillboars
---
Oh now I remember why I suddenly stopped leveling my main 3 weeks ago and keep procrastinating going back to it by leveling some new alt. Fuck that place is painful, getting constantly killed by groups of the other faction and getting mobs stolen by your own faction, Stranglethorn Vale questing was actually fun compared to this shitshow.  I still have the last part to do, I just want my god damn Nifty Stopwatch!
---
I just wanted to see if I could yet. Not 60.
---
Literally nobody said that.
---
This time a month ago our WC group done four 72 rolls over a chest, with a 75 last roll
---
I know, I'm waiting for it.
---
They were asking around. We have a pretty good community on our server so it appears a few other guilds helped them out.
---
I‚Äôm a mage who has farmed whelps for hours. Like 20+ total. But at the time, small flame sacs were going 5 for 1g on my server and I was getting my pet anyway.
---
I wish I knew about the cancer that streamers bring to your server, Jesus fucking christ talk about unplayable on alliance.
---
Ehhhh....wut
---
Hate to say it but that's part of the classic way. I think you get Bear form at level 10? If so you can totally hang out in bear form for beefboy defensive stats.  You can also take it a bit slower and moonfire and auto attack and save your mana for your rejuvenations. Good luck!
---
That‚Äôs a good way to lose every BOE blue/epic and cry ninja.
---
Not even the level 25 plus 20 rod. Sad.
---
My god you're right! That's the exact same fucking thing!
---
We are in the middle of category 5 shit-a-cane Randy, it's a shit bearing system.
---
I found out from a YouTube video. Like an interview or where he was posting things online and responding
---
If you sit in an inn or in most major city‚Äôs, you‚Äôll gain a double xp boost which will continue growing for up to 10 days. After those 10 days, any xp gained from killing beasts is doubled. It maxes out at a level and a half worth of boost.
---
Haha right on well y'all got a z anyhow , but Saturday is for the boys!!!
---
Wtf if that‚Äôs true you‚Äôre so lucky.  I love this show so much.
---
I just said it in a different thing before i saw this comment. But BoS everyone else in the group and you should have concencrate as a prot pally ( i know its in the holy tree) you should be able to hold agro fairly easy if BoS is up and you spam con.
---
People often forget that most vanilla players played on potato computers too, I know I for sure did. Raiding got MUCH easier when I finally built a PC that could handle it. Crap tier computers today play the game just fine.
---
How is Ni involved with this?
---
I found a bot in vanilla. Did everything I could to verify it. The clincher was fearing the mob up a hill you could get but he ran straight even after I demonstrated how to get it. 
---
So I bought a skinning knife. Wrapped it as a present I think and did a 50g cod which got accepted.
---
I did the same. I cleared it weekly for the rep on my hunter.           
---
By the time I hit exalted I saw three Eyes, however I've never seen a TF binding drop.
---
Nah there are many people like him. Need rolling a BoE because it‚Äôs worth a lot of money in mid-levels doesn‚Äôt make him an asshole, it makes him a normal wow player
---
Yeah man well trying to keep it lvl 30 + for now we're at 900 and just did our first trash mob clear of MC tonight
---
So, anyone else get a character semi high and realize you don't like it? I hit 40 on my mage, bought my mount and I kind of just hate it since around level 35-36. Mage was my OG main, but I'm finding it super boring now. I hopped around DK, Paladin and Mage in retail. I'm probably craving some faster paced melee.
---
Welcome to Reddit...
---
I second this.
---
Need before greed is trash 
---
Just group loot and if you need the item, great if not then greed
---
Okay. And I do have bear form but all i can really do in it so far is autoattack really.
---
I guess at least now I know im not doing something completely wrong
---
Drinky poo

What to do when its loot council?
---
I still got 2 stacks of harvest fest food feeling good

Lol it's hard to take you serious after reading Quiltshartz. Lighten up man
---
Thank you! For some reason it didn't even cross my ming to check youtube :D
---
MadSeasonShow I don't watch stream but his YouTube videos are fantastic.  He has a great voice and is not someone who seems to be dramatic.
---
By far my favorite Classic content creator.
---
Can see that now, thank you!
---
I should make an Onyxia scale cloak crafting alt named Associate of Scales.
---
The quest line (which was the best quest line they've ever done) included a huge battle in Undercity, and apparently since they were redoing Undercity at the time it broke the quest so bad they decided to just take it out and permanently open the Wrath gate. I always looked forward to that quest on my alts and I was pretty sad when they took it out, as it is a climax of multiple storylines that  you explore while leveling in Northrend.  
---
As much as I enjoy classic I feel like Wrath of the Lich King was the best expansion, and Arthas the best villain, that WOW ever had.

Warrior. Taunt and go grab a drink.

Probs shaman
---
Yup
---
~5%
---
I know Reddit is saying not to give advice for GF/wives playing the game, but at least tell her to use WASD lol
---
lowbie druid tanking is pretty forgiving.
---
Partly the update, partly the art style. It's like how most ps1/n64 hell even ps2 games look ass now but a lot of the SNES era sprite art still looks nice.
---
Grats!
---
Some people are shitty. That sucks dude.
---
I'm curious how this compares to RFD where you get resisted less and can kill more bosses?
---
I have and did receive help in stv. Hillsbrad just heavier alliance presence no higher lvl horde were around.
---
Thats our GM, he gets too much free shit already
---
About that last part. Yeah people did it at level 56, the best players in the world... Not some average Joe pug. Been practicing the game for the last 6 years is a lot different than bringing 10 ret paladins and expecting to steamroll the bosses. This is a very narrow minded look at the entire scenario. Your guild will still wipe in MC with 40 people that seemingly min/max their gear.
---
[Hey, can i get some more food and water? Thanks](https://imgur.com/a/2kpRATX)
---
Druid will pick up a lot when you get cat form at 20, but hybrids are generally slower going than pure damage classes.
---
This makes me happy.
---
Lol they just come out the jungle onto the road making that gorilla noise and pound you.
---
Yeah might as well change his name to KD.
---
Welcome to a very complex game
---
Once you get in a player owned Corp there is a real risk of awoxing (someone joining it to steal anything not bolted down or pvp his fellow Corp mate ). 
---
This is why the recruitment process is very lengthy.  You take a risk with any member.   In big ns (nullsec) alliances the standard is the corp (corporation or guild in wow) guarantees it members so if a player in my Corp kills a alliance member we pay the cost of what he kills within 24h.  
---
If you ask for access in Eve they are likely to remove you from Corp because asking is the equivalent of asking me to borrow my credit card.  
---
You get promoted by necessity 
---
You don‚Äôt wanted be promoted unless your masochistic.  It‚Äôs a lot of work that needs to be done. 
---
Flying a jump freighter back forth between our structures to fuel then.  Carrying cargo between our home and jita (tradehub). 
---
Spending time on drama queens. Oh yes they exist. Sit in alliance meeting if your a diplo (diplomat) 
---
Soend hours looking through player logs to find spies     (With correct api keys we can see everything.  Who sent cash to who. What Mail you got. Etc.  ).
---
Eve as an officer became a second job to me.   After dinner I HAD TO .......
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fine dude everyone got their reason. It just feels hella bad if you see a warrior struggling.
---
A tank trying to hold multiple mobs will constantly be cycling through targets though
---
Game lingo but yes. See other thread I tried to explain it there.
---
The armor wouldn't do anything though against a mob attacking with fire, right?    Wouldn't I be better off with FR, or stam?
---
No op, but I'm a pally and leveling is slow enough,  no way am I going to try it specced as healer. I should imagine most healers are dps spec until 60.
---
If you don't want Warrior, Druid is the way to go.
---
Lol ... shadow priests are bullshit.
---
Just stun the rogue and nuke. Flare if they stealth. FD trap and hope it works. Serpent Sting is usually the first thing I hit a rogue with after they've popped vanish.
---
EVERYONE is looking at your gut, it's fucking huge.
---
Smoke more weed Turtle. Seriously, smoke more weed.
---
what exactly, is its place?
---
Nobody owns the mobs. They respawn.
---
We are here. Those of us who main healers are very team oriented. I wanted a DPS alt in order to farm with. Its rough being a 60 healer and not being able to grind gold.
---
its less i do not WANT to play warrior, i would, IMO, prefer to actually, i am just really bad at tanking in general it seems, so was not sure if either of the others was easier.
---
Peanut butter and JJAAAAAAMMMMMM
---
Love the idea that the other faction is ‚Äúso mad‚Äù when they gather resources to respond to a 40 man raid in a leveling zone üôÑ

&gt; It maxes out at a level and a half worth of boost.
---
Does this mean the boost will only last until you've gained a level and a half worth of XP or simply gained a level and a half?
---
Huge damage spells right after my charge- where did the adds go

Open with Blizzard - tank bad, kick and regroup

Lol

&gt; The lich king is a position, Arthas destroyed what remains of ner‚Äôzuhl  when he took over with a fragment of his spirit remaining in the helm  but was completely powerless. 
---
by this same logic arthas himself was powerless as he was hardly in control. as a matter of fact the reason there must always been a lich king is because he was holding the scourge back.
---
&gt; Everything that happens in and after WC 3 all human baby, 100% mass slaughter of innocents commuted by the human royalty. 
---
is this how we play it? it's all about race not faction loyalties?
---
you sure?
---
the lich king was undead. guess we should blame that one on the forsaken as well? he was their prince. had nothing to do with stormwind.
---
Not enough rogues know how strong distract can be
---
Revenge over everything
---
They either muscle their way through the pages, don't buy the items because the price is too high on the first page, or they use an add on.
---
that's kinda like whwn you're about to sneeze and after a while of preparing you just make a tiny sound that somehow is a sneeze
---
Photoshoped
---
Roll pve
---
Take it from a rogue main since 05, distract is such a life saver sometimes, and it makes life hella easier.
---
Wish it would work like that.
---
A tank only needs tank gear to help him get gear like ravager for soloing. If he passed on ravager when he actually needed it he's an idiot, more likely he was happier with his current weapon which would mean he had a ravager already.
---
It depends on the group whether the healer has mana to spare or not. You seem to be taking the retail mentality to classic. If you have an appropriate level group that's playing decently, then you can make it through a lot of instances with almost zero downtime.
---
With PUGs, you might have a tank who takes too much damage or doesn't pay attention, DPS who pulls aggro and gets hit constantly, or players might be a bit low for the dungeon and the fights just go on forever, or there's too much chaos.
---
There are all sorts of reasons the healer might have downtime, and many instances where leaving the group to pull while you drink isn't possible because everyone is taking too much damage too quickly.
---
That you seem to have no awareness of this is just telling me you aren't that good of a player, which is fine. Just don't try to say wrong information on Reddit.
---
(I'm a healer FYI)
---
The axe does end up marginally higher damage, especially if you have axe spec
---
Aren't warriors the only tanks in classic with a taunt?
---
Ah, ok. Guessing that was only possible in the early days. Iron ore/bar alone is 10s on my server.
---
In the good version of WoW Garrosh dies there.
---
I mean, nothing wrong with calling your wife adorable? Seems like you are trying to SJW this one a bit too hard.
---
Pfft, I waited on mine until I was 49. Dunno why everyone's so hung up on getting it exactly at 40. I spent like 6 days walking my way to 40, I can spend another 2 walking to 50.
---
LOL
---
I second this pve all the way or try another class
---
there's seriously tons of mages, whenever I start a party and LFM I get 12 mages whispering me in a split second, I don't mind taking them all since the runs go quick but they gotta fight for loot in every party they join. Even PUG MC we did had 13 mages or something ridiculous, 2 rogue, 1 druid, 1 holy pala, 2 lock :p
---
You're a genius. I never thought about that!
---
It's funny because it's probably true. I lost a roll on hypnotic blade out of sm to a hunter.
---
MORE! We need more WOW stuff as Mechs!
---
Wait, wait, wait... you chose and Night Elf and didn't jump even once in the video?!?!
---
Let me know what you find. I'm at 33 as well and been struggling for two levels now just out of quests besides orange ones. Wondering what the best grinding spot is.
---
I'm horde lock tho.
---
Was in a group that accidentally had Need before Greed on. First piece of loot that dropped off the first trash pack was an epic no one needed but only three people could roll on.
---
That was fun.
---
Limiting himself? Limiting what? He's doing what he wants to do. You know, for fun? He would be limiting his enjoyment of the game if he went to do whatever farming you are suggesting. There's no such thing as taking a farming spot from someone else. He was there first. If anyone wants to compete they are free to try to cut in.
---
There are tons of different things to do in this game. I'm sick of people who can't settle for the second or third best thing that they want to do.
---
This is a multiplayer game, sometimes you have to work around, with, or against others.
---
Some people prefer to be self-sufficient. I like grinding my own mats most of the time in lieu of buying them. If I have leftovers after my original goal is accomplished, I can sell whatever I make or sell the mats directly, or hold on to them to make stuff for an alt. 
---
The game isn't wholly about gold and economy for all players, or even about optimisation generally for all players. I have enough economy and money efficiency to worry about in the real world, sometimes I just want to be a fantasy character killing dangerous enemies to achieve a goal.
---
Do not farm the bats. Yes they drop expensive loot but the drop rate is extremely low. The numbers people hear about farming bats are from private servers..
---
Nah fuck that. Unless you are tipping the healer to rez you or the lock to summon you as well.
---
Just... just don‚Äôt pvp then?
---
Eh, that left hand doesn't go there.
---
By get rid of I mean stop upgrading it really
---
You've got a video card in there, and I'm guessing it's either a 1050, a 1060 or a 2060. Either way full settings will probably work.
---
wont work at level 30-39. Because a lot of classes learn to use gear that they couldnt before at lvl 40. 
---
 Especially shamans
---
He said no dungeons in his post as he doesn‚Äôt have time for it.
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs place isn‚Äôt in random pugs. Sounds like they had every right to rage quit if they can‚Äôt even roll on vendor fodder. It sounds like you are assuming players know what this is. I played from BC to right after WoD released. Never seen this stupid loot setup or heard of it til now. If you don‚Äôt want people ninja looting blue boe gear then everyone roll need. Most of it goes to the AH anyways. Or at least it should when leveling.
---
And what do you mean they wanted need before greed? I‚Äôve never heard of anyone requesting Need before greed.

The guy with the infernal on the way into blackrock from kargath will start a tailoring quest chain that includes the shadow weave headpiece pattern.

Stay in good spirits! Every roll you lose is a roll you won't have to go up against next raid \^\_\^ at this pace you and your droogies will be in the height of fashion when phase two is released.

Thats... scummy

You're not wrong, I'm a guild leader of one of the largest horde guilds on Thunderfury.   Clapping alliance is our past time.

You'll be fine as 31/8/12. Raided AQ 40 with that in vanilla and was always around top 5 with the other rogues and our 1 dps warrior.
---
I literally can not complete the toxic horror quest, because there are 10 people camping them at any given time
---
Mostly did guild runs and rolled on mainspec items, then offspec after the tanks were geared. And after i had a bit of gear i used it to tank other dungeons and get both MS/OS
---
Get yourself an addon called VanosKOS - it lets you put people on a hatelist and give a reason why, bailing on a group cause you didn't get the loot you wanted screws everyone else over and helps avoid ever grouping with them again!
---
Well yeah they go out and interact with people face to face. *shudder*
---
Don't you also need to be like, specifically specced into aoe farming as a mage? As opposed to the dungeon or pvp spec you'd generally be using when not aoe farming? That's a pain in the ass I would personally opt out of if I played mage, and just farm less efficiently.
---
Not my problem :) Just echoing observations from the community, my static group of people/server have been pretty dope.
---
But it seems to be a common trend among complaints/screenshots in the reddit.

Sorrynotsorry

Linked it in guild,  they saw the same.
---
Then don't advertise it in chat,, or even better, advertise a price that is acceptable to you.
---
ahh yes, fairs fair guess the death threats reasonable
---
You froze it into a solid block of ice and it shattered when the mob hit the ground.  Or something like that.
---
"I've got my own, thanks."
---
Was it free? No? Then drink what I'm giving you and save that expensive shit for later!
---
The blood drained too quickly for you to loot it because the mob was cut to bits.
---
That‚Äôs what I would have thought but OP wants to get butthurt enough to make a reddit post whining cause players are mad they don‚Äôt get a chance at rolling on vendor fodder and leave, because they don‚Äôt know about this shit loot system. I would too, vendoring greens no one needs makes more money then the money you loot off mobs by far. Who enters a dungeon pug and checks the loot rules? I‚Äôve never seen this used in game and I‚Äôve put a LOT of time into wow. OP sounds greedy as fuck
---
if there is a melee dps, do the target of target on him.  tanks will be tab sundering constantly to make sure his threat stays above healers passive threat.  but a melee dps should only be focusing on skull, and target of target will work best with them.
---
You could go boomkin and heal dungeons. Be better doing feral if you're questing primarily tho.
---
Druids have a taunt as well.
---
Shit I don't remember, do warlocks have to resummon their pet every life?
---
Iirc they get it back automatically unless the pet itself was killed before the warlock died
---
Maybe a liver to a boar in WoW is like an appendix to us and they've already had theirs removed.
---
Words to live by

Do tanking druids need water? Legit question.

That‚Äôs just taking this whole thread out of context. OP and the comments are saying it‚Äôs adorable that she‚Äôs playing games, not that she‚Äôs adorable.

Started playing on launch day, hit 40 on my mage last Wednesday. I haven't played again aside from AH. Bought my mount and decided I don't want to play mage anymore lol.
---
If you enable the fishing tracker in the Fishing Buddy addon, it will tell you what the max level is for the area you're currently fishing in and give you a percentage of your progress towards that.
---
I thought classic didn't have focus target?
---
You really think that everyone wants to and should do the most efficient thing for gold per hour? Why is it so difficult to accept that he likes farming there and it drops a material he needs?
---
Ffs, sometimes I pick my farming spot based on which area looks the most pleasing and has my favorite in-game music
---
I believe the chances are 96 / 91,962,520
---
There are 96 sets of 5 rolls that form a sequence, unordered (1 2 3 4 5, 2 3 4 5 6,....96 97 98 99 100) There are a total of 91,962,520 possible combinations of 5 rolls (this is a combination with repetition allowed).
---
Were they really? I guess I'm extra lucky that I managed to order on time. Where was it announced? I honestly don't even remember ordering mine
---
For a boss drop, they'll go masterloot.  I dont know about for orb's but I imagine they just go on an honor system and kick you if you dont.  Or maybe they ML that too.
---
Never actually done strat yet.  I kinda hate strat/scholo.
---
&gt; Fury is the only DPS i didn't play at max level in vanilla
---
You had a level 60 of every class but fury warrior in vanilla and you can't answer this question for yourself?
---
Druids are pretty great dungeon tanks but require a bit more gear to raid tank because of crushing blows.
---
Horde *slightly* heavy server. It‚Äôs not 90-10. More like 60-40
---
I am asking out of sheer ignorance. On PVE servers, can you run around the opposing factions cities? Or do the guards promptly dispose of you when you try to enter?
---
He was a paly
---
The Nameless on Mankrik changed loot rules the week before the raid to suddenly include loot reservations and DKP (including bonus DKP for officers and friends of the guild leaders) in hopes that people wouldn't notice and would raid anyway.

I play 6 characters at the same time, and every time i log in, i roll a virtual dice to decide what character to play. They are all between level 6 and 10 right now.

People really have no respect, with all the ‚Äútank ubrs?‚Äù spam.
---
Call me old fashioned, but If you‚Äôre too lazy to write out a sentence then how will you have the patience to run an entire dungeon?
---
Even if you are copy pasting it‚Äôs just common decency to at least say something like ‚ÄúHi there! Would you like to do UBRS with us? We need a tank.‚Äù
---
Hell, I‚Äôve had whispers literally saying ‚Äúcome heal BRD‚Äù and shit like that. No, fuck you, you‚Äôre supposed to ask someone and not command them to. I‚Äôm not a pet! /rant
---
Yeah, honestly I found him super annoying and he was one of the pile of reasons I stopped playing. Makes no sense that Thrall would be so foolish as to trust the Horde to such an obvious douchebag.
---
Moral of the story is people are shitty.
---
Not gonna lie, those poisons are kinda expensive lol.
---
Magetards!
---
I agree with your statement.  
---
But there are different scenarios in play here:
---
If threat will continue NOT being a problem for us, Onyx trinket + BWL trinket will remain the best mitigation throughout the game.  
---
Realistically during AQ, one of them MIGHT have to be changed due to threat issues.  
---
However, Prestor's Talisman more or less gives the same stats as Onyx Pendant with the exception of 10 stamina, which is neglectable.  
---
Also there is no trinket piece that will ever give as much Parry as the Onyx Trinket does. Parry = AA reset = More Rage = More threat. But obviously not to the same extend as Onyx Pendant if you look at them 1vs1.
---
&gt; Time is money, friend.
---
I'd like to know the name of that last dungeon. Asking for a friend.
---
96 sets, each rollable in 5! different ways. 
---
Out of e10 possible rolls.
---
They're not entirely pink. There are purple drops.
---
Good PvP enhancement names will be fed into the Spy addon and everytime it pops up in your target, you look around and R1 frostbolt/sheep them on their mount.
---
From then on it's an ez kite and fight.
---
I heard Asmongold was the best player in WoW so I watched him. He did this Girabashi Arena or whatever it‚Äôs called before he went on this weird RP thing asking if people were worthy of his guild. I found him pompous and cringy, but that‚Äôs just me. I quickly started looking for other streamers. 
---
Swifty was the next guy I found and enjoyed, but he‚Äôs got these weird self-made meme things that I cannot stand and seem to be made for children. He‚Äôs a cool dude, but while I‚Äôm streaming him at night while playing WoW, his periodic screaming really annoys me. 
---
Shroud seems down to earth and was fun to watch at first, but nothing that kept me interested. 
---
Esfand was a guy I didn‚Äôt inherently like at first, but he grew on me the most. He‚Äôs pretty honest, doesn‚Äôt like a lot of drama, and watching him FINALLY get his chest from BRD felt rewarding even for me. He doesn‚Äôt yell (often) or have stupid self-made memes that pop up too often, his channel isn‚Äôt filled with a bunch of frill, and he isn‚Äôt so involved with loathing the Horde (like Asmon). So now Esfand is who I like to watch while playing.
---
Yes it may get old watching the streamers do MC for the billionth time, but often times I‚Äôm not fully watching the stream, so it‚Äôs alright. Also, I haven‚Äôt played WoW in years so watching them do end-game dungeons and raids helps me remember boss fights and layouts.
---
Damn I have to know, did he do it with feeling?
---
I charge 2g a port if I‚Äôm not doing anything and 5g if it‚Äôs out of my way.
---
Stop giving out shit for free.
---
Yes. 100% yes. That sucks, but it's lightyears better than the DK system. Having lived through the last 15 years of wow without a break, I feel extremely confident the DK system was a poorly  implemented choice that should never have been made.
---
I think that's brd arena run only and I'd probably say that's about 10 minutes.  You really only have to kill 3-5 mobs before the boss. I'd say the boss probably takes about 5 minutes  simply because of the waves of mobs taking a bit to trickle out before main boss comes out.
---
Yeah it really did. I wasn‚Äôt expecting dungeons to be THAT easy lmao. Really upsetting, but at least leveling alts is nice and fast.
---
Guards will still wreck your booty. Any starting zone will be kos as well.
---
What would you say about 2 dps vs 1 heals 1 dps? I think with the heals, the dps should be able to take down one of the others and then inevitably kill the 2nd. Depending on Comp, but the above perspective should win every time. Not to mention, if the teams are balanced it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be an issue and may the best team win.
---
arguing with reddit is dumb, the most important thing is that you know you're right, which you are
---
That makes sense. So the more serious pvp‚Äôers you have on your server, the harder it will be to obtain. Gotcha.
---
My druid was 47 when I was like "meh". Wasn't really looking forward to healing on a druid with no magic dispel or rez. Rerolled paladin and just hit 55 on it. Already thinking of alts though.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Ha, I had something similar happen. Was passing through the Badlands on my mount when a guy whispers me. He half-jokingly asks for 2g to finish up his mount, which isn't chumpchange but isn't a HUGE deal either. I was in a good mood due to very recently catching Broken Tooth on my hunter, so I give it to him and went on my merry way.
---
I also recently met a low level warrior in Ironforge seemingly DESPERATE to dual wield maces and asked me to get him one more, just one with no frills.
---
Having finally fallen to trying out alts instead of just one main, it's crazy how a little gold that's easier to come by can make a HUGE difference to earlier levels.
---
For this reason, I highly recommend Hakurai‚Äôs 1-60 efficient leveling guide. It will take you from zone to zone and give you the most efficient quest routes so that you can efficiently quest your way to 60. Why make 5 trips to Dustwallow Marsh when you can make 1 trip and turn in 5 different quests from various start locations at the same time. It‚Äôs a great guide, highly recommend it.
---
The way she goes boys
---
It becomes pretty bad for a guild to pull stunts like this.  Your image matters and screwing over your guildies or being dishonest to your own guild will hurt your recruiting.
---
It's not so much about trusting them as being a bit shocked they'd shoot themselves this bad.
---
Going to an opposing faction city, or any zone controlled by the other faction (e.g. Barrens, Elwynn Forest) works the same no matter what server you are on. In all servers, you will be automatically pvp flagged while the opposing faction will not be pvp flagged unless they choose to be. And the guards will attack you in all servers.
---
Its like having 1,000,000,000 in cash in the bank. No hopes to ever use it. Seems like a waste for someone who could enjoy the name instead of hoarding them for oneself.
---
but my total was using a combination which is unordered. so i think it would be wrong to count the sequences as permutations which are ordered. either compare unordered to unordered, or ordered to ordered.
---
Some guy was telling me about Yahweh Five earlier and I asked him how many Jewish Gods there were.
---
Tbh you can reserve whatever shit you want, but then don‚Äôt be surprised if no one joins.

LMAO
---
Recognise your name, which server you on? Firemaw?
---
If i get ganked to much. I fly to hillsbrad and keep hillsbrad fields safe untill high levels come and break me out of the council house.
---
As mentioned above I do not whisper them at all. I simply facepalm at their stupidity and go questing or something.  
---
And you remind me of an 60 year old granny, who can be kept busy by candycrush for 5 hours straight lol. Farming bears for 2 hours for 4 Gold cause the forrest is pretty.
---
Hunters use melee weapons 100x more than rouges or wars use ranged. Melee weapons are huge in pvp
---
Cockroach vendor!
---
Paladin then? As a horde player i find them very annoying in PvP. Hard to kill and versatile.
---
It's the norm for ninjas...
---
41 priest here. I was questing and doing a few dungeons up to about level 35 but it seems now that it's more time actually moving around different areas chasing quests than it is worth. Should I just grind dungeons/mobs from now on? I reckon once I get to 50ish I will respec out of shadow and start doing BRD etc..  for gear.
---
I mean in lower lvl dungeons they were looking for dps, did fine as cat Druid dps. Pop out whenever to buff and faerie fire (BFF/stockades)
---
We did this back in the vanilla days. We drive from Seattle to LA to meet up with some the guild at a giant hose party. One of the most memorable community parts of the game for me.
---
I would open:  
---
1. Cheap shot  
---
2. slice and dice  
---
3. gouge right at 100 energy (you get around 20 every 2 seconds)  
---
4. find the back of the mob in this time and get a backstab off  
---
5. sinister strike  
---
6. eviscerate if it kills, otherwise repeat from step 2 with combo points 
---
I got 2 points in SS and 3 in gouge in combat tree. Followed this spec and originally I did get Rem. But eventually I got rid of it because there got to be too much down time between some pulls.  
---
This is the spec I have/had, for the most part. I started in combat tree first to get Adrenaline Rush ASAP https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow#combat-daggers-15-31-5-rogue-talent-build
---
I did not get improved ambush, because it doesn't crit enough. As you get into the 40s you stop almost 1 shorting mobs with ambushes
---
Remember, for pvp, a drinking caster is a dead caster with an ambush! Wait for em to get nice and thirsty then wham üó° üó°üíØ % crit every time
---
I managed to rush the last few levels to get to 60, just in time to go into the raid.
---
I got so excited the only S/S of the raid was from the meters after we all ported out to IF, yes yes meters don't matter but dang I can't believe how well I did (this was with recklessness, so it isn't something normal for a fresh 60 warrior). 
---
Also, I am 95% sure its broken, as I am sure the dps shown is only for what my addon can gather, and is thus not accurate.
---
So everyone should roll need on all level 50+ plate? 2g is nothing. Green weapons vendor for 2g at higher levels, blue items are easily 4g.
---
Double hot helps enough for me. Taunt and or bash if someone does pull and it's like a fix button. Using wrath is cool though, really embracing the hybrid aspect.
---
He meant pull aggro off you.
---
Best captain Star Trek ever had!
---
"but I need water essences"
---
Or you can farm somewhere else and earn the guild to purchase them, and leave those spots for classes that have more limited farming options.
---
If you get say 3 essences an hour, gz. But you could have instead spent that hour farming 50g an hour, bought those essences and had money left over. And in doing so opened that spot to someone else where 3 essences an hour to sell is peak efficiency for them.
---
Just smart enough to put 2 and 2 together, not smart enough to realize that's not what the question asked you to solve for.
---
Had to respec mage cuz my guild is only taking 1 feral
---
I want friend ..
---
Yes!
---
When work buddies start taking hunting I always ask 'em. If they use this trick
---
Would probably save the poor kid from an aneurysm.
---
I've thought about going Prot for 5mans but the lack of a taunt hurts them in raids too much so I'm not sure what I'd even be gearing towards.
---
I waited for this!
---
Its not rocket appliances
---
How to never be able get into a group again
---
How's the faction balance on Felstriker?
---
Arugal is too imbalanced
---
Meh it might not have been wrapped it was a long time ago but I did get gold from the script bot hunter by doing a cod.
---
I was able to heal as shadow until full BRD runs. Switched to deep holy around 54/55 for it, did a few runs, got super lucky with gear. And I did UnGoro and Winterspring just staying as holy and it wasn't too bad. Not as smooth as shadow and not having spirit tap/wand sucks but the holy talents also boost smite a lot so it's not the worst just a bit slower.
---
lol pally tank
---
It‚Äôs easy to tank though tbh, you need to watch the healers mana, don‚Äôt give a fuck about dps mana. Mages can‚Äôt pull aggro if they have no mana lulw
---
I mean, they beat everyone else to the punch with those names, and there‚Äôs thousands upon thousands of names you could choose from . It‚Äôs not like these 10 are your only option.
---
"bro, you seen Bright? It's so adequate, you're gonna tolerate it for sure. I promise, wildly adequate, I only regret like 10% of the time I spent watching it"
---
I haven't actually seen it yet, I just found myself tickled by imagining this conversation.
---
Druid is probably the second fastest leveling class. 10-20 kind of sucks because you will be in bear the whole time. 20 on is fun though. I can take 2 mobs my level no problem in cat. You do a lot of damage and when you get low health you can pop out of cat, regrowth and rejuvenate yourself pop back in cat and continue to dominate.
---
That‚Äôs good!
---
Yikes
---
We understand you're stupid, that's not the point though
---
The escalation after you ask ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù is *phenomenal*. 10/10 read
---
You sure? I thought shield slam did more threat per cast
---
Nice! First off, candy crush is not pretty nor is the music pleasing. Secondly, this is a game.
---
Games are supposed to be....wait for it....you got it.... FUN!
---
The only important thing about playing a game is that it is fun for the person playing it. That's it.
---
Do you even enjoy leveling quickly or earning gold quickly? Is this some sort of competition for you? I almost want to ask if you even enjoy playing this game most of the time.
---
Tbp?

This is too hq for this sub :s amazing art

If you die and your pet doesn‚Äôt the soulshard gets refunded but you have to resummon

Im 21 is that old?
---
Killing higher levels as paladin is fine, it's just slow as shit.
---
Multiple enemies can be harsh because of healing knockback. If they're you're level you can kill a couple before needing to really heal so you should still be good.
---
Saying that your healer needs to 'ask for it' and then deciding whether you give them or not based on how nicely they ask (as if they're your 5yo and you're teaching them etiquette) is making a 'thing' out of it. 
---
I just open trade with the healer as soon as I see them and give them 60 water. It's not 'bending over backwards', it's part of the kit and it makes the dungeon smoother and faster, which is **good for me** too. 
---
Some of you act as if you're exclusively doing the other guy a favor..
---
That guy must be quite the person IRL.  Everyone probably hates him.

If you're questing in the north why are you flying to BB instead of Duskwood?

huh i guess alliance are actually gay

To add, many items in WoW Classic just have stupid stats on them, it was "endearing" to help make the better items really stand out without blowing up the power level of everything.  Additionally, the combat system was way different when some of the items were implemented and they never went back to tweak them.
---
You'll find lots of hunter items that have strength on them, if you're ever not sure just ask the group you're in what is appropriate.

50/50. It either happens, or it doesn't....

It's bad compared to devilsaur
---
You can do all the content in any of the specs. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Play whatever you think is fun until it becomes a conflict with getting a raid spot.
---
Why tho? Looks awful
---
If it‚Äôs same faction it‚Äôs toxic af. If it‚Äôs opposite faction it‚Äôs fair game. If someone same faction is standing near you, you fking know what he‚Äôs trying to do, cause there‚Äôs no reason they should stand near you as you kill a devilsaur. Just don‚Äôt loot and wait
---
We couldnt secure enough FR to become completely resistant to the knockback, so we just made a system with the knockback in mind.
---
mainTank says "Green" on discord if he manages to resist.
---
And he says "Red" on discord if he gets knocked to space.
---
Offtank moves out on every knockback and moves back into melee range immediately after the knockback, if the codeword "Red" has been said, he will taunt and say "Green" till the maintank comes back.
---
Lowered our deaths considerably and allowed us to quickly and easily kill rag.
---
For the other bosses in there, if tanks are having issues, then its best to slow things down a bit, add a few more healers than needed to the raid setup and take it from there, truth is that dps requirements are extremely low, and if people live, you win everytime.
---
You're hitting a sweet spot where there are few quests and many dungeons to choose from.  As a healer you can do well to run dungeons repeatedly even if you're a bit low.
---
Hey! There are skinned centaurs in game but i cant skin em im calling unfair lies
---
Nah but if there are a million players with 9 guys yada yada. Maybe i wanna see a guy named "dude" out in the world over xxdudesxx. If your first in line at the cafeteria and take all the maccaroni just for it to sit on your plate while others watch it rot makes 0 sense. But you feel good hoardin all them mac n cheeses!
---
I also have that skull hanging in my living room!
---
Quick question as my main is a Warlock and I never played vanilla, is off hand dagger better than staff?
---
Well you could start playing a warrior channeling all your hatred into fuel to wipe out your enemies. 
---
Also go for a pve Server that way you wont get ganked.
---
I liked being a part of the third Ghoul faction in the zombie invasion event before Wrath released. You got to blow yourself up and infect all the people in the auction house!
---
Troll for group content, undead for solo content. Don‚Äôt believe the streamer hype on shadowguard. 
---
Make up your own mind. Found it informative to watch kala‚Äôs latest video on the matter and then watch ooze‚Äôs reaction to Kala‚Äôs video. Should give you enough info to make a decision.
---
I usually give the healer 120 water. Because I know they have a ***MIGHTY THIRST***
---
I once had a warlock give me 50s though which was really sweet
---
*"Very bright was that rifle when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its barrel was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Bang√∫ril, Boomstick of the East"*

No, roll a better class then. You lose at the tag you lose the skin. What are you farming devilsaur s with? Warrior?

You really aren't. Eventually you'll get tired of groups, and put on DND. Sometime later a GM will contact you for suspected botting.

This happened to me back in vanilla, which is one of the reasons I play DPS now.
---
I'm 44 too. It's really fun to play when we get the chance
---
My guild is spending a ton of time with spread sheets everywhere. And there are too many forms.
---
Are there better ways to keep track of loot, so sign ups and etc?

Looking for examples

47 mage here and I have not been whispered once for water

Is that a thing?

The point is to not understand how other classes work? Or not reading and understanding things? Because you seem to have that nailed.

Have you seen this movie?

Is there a sub that is like old classicwow?
---
This thing has been a shitshow for over 6 months. It's literally memes all day every day.

Where do you go on reddit to discuss classic wow? Far as I can tell not here?

PS I used to be subbed here until about a year ago so I've been looking

2 mages in one group

That's your problem.. You should know which kinda player you are getting
---
Cheap em, into kidney, into blind (dont use deadly poison) stealth, cheap, into kidney. (Hopefully your slow poison has procced by now. )Try and get a 5 combo point evicerate. If they arent dead yet gouge them, bandage and sinister strike like your life depends on it
---
I've been following a leveling guide from classicwow.live or something like that, Google classic wow live leveling guide it's quite good tells you where to go and whatnot to maximize efficiency. It also tells you to do dungeons once you gather enough quests and it's interactive in that you can specifically enter your race and class and is specifically designed for that
---
I really enjoy EsfandTV, number one Ret Pally on Twitch :D
---
Should I even roll warrior if I want to be competitive in PvP (solo and group)? I'm having a hard time picking between rogue or warrior.
---
Basically if you have flesh, I should be able to carve it off you and vendor it for whatever price these guys will pay
---
So I should be farming anger for force of will? I got HoJ from anger a few days ago. Has something been changes already?
---
Is it just me or are the icons super high quality ?
---
Druid tanking is not only easy, it is viable throughout ALL classic content. Anyone who does not believe that need only to watch Skarm. He'll be the first to admit that there are certain fights that warrior tanks are needed to MT and that they are best suited for OT. Personally, I don't accept the argument that his videos are from private servers and therefore irrelevant. After classic was released they found that private servers had actually over tuned dungeon and raid bosses, so if anything it only boosts the fact that druid's are 85% capable main tanks and ALWAYS a capable off tank.
---
should definitely duel him and use pots, especially if you don't need to, and make a macro to when you use it that makes you say "mmh, pots, yummy!"
---
Idk imo it‚Äôs called greed and need for a reason. Tbh I would prefer if you need on something that it would bind to you. Seems like a great way to cut this shit out
---
I thought I was the only one doing this strat
---
They are all shit names, if he wanna waste his life doing that I don't see the issue.
---
Maybe this one? https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rclootcouncil-classic/
---
Why is that a problem?  It's a 10 man raid.  2 of one class is quite common.
---
Warlocks!!! What professions are you taking and why?!?
---
Good way to hold aggro in this new AOE meta era is to dot yourself before charging, so once in a while you gotta drink. Regrouth + bear form is more than 1.5k mana, that takes 1:30 to regen, so it depends on how much the fights last
---
what PvP server seems to be the most "balanced", population wise, west coast server? i know it'll never be 1:1, but, i want something that's, at least, somewhat close.
---
I am
---
I'm not attempting to insult you, if you're spending 7-8+ hours a day playing, you are neglecting other aspects of your life.
---
People \*should\* be producing something outside of just pouring hours into a video game - maybe it's working a conventional job, maybe it's volunteering, maybe it's writing a novel, honestly even just being a Soundcloud rapper is tremendously better than just doing nothing.  This takes time.  And yes, people should interact with other people outside of the context of a video game.  And they should engage with a diversity of interests.  Not doing any of these things is neglecting some aspect of your life.
---
And, importantly, you can temporarily neglect important aspects of your life; the only person who mentioned someone's "life crumbling" or any long term neglect is you.  It's possible that I'm wrong, but the fact that you're so sensitive to the assertion that 'hey, maybe you haven't been the best person you could be for the past few weeks' only is further assurance that I'm not.
---
Because only dumb people believe IQ is a really good indicator of a person. Or of much of anything really.
---
As druid, They are sleep and pat on sight
---
From experience druid is easy because you just don't have that many abilities. If I recall correctly at level 60 your bear tanking skills barely fill up a single action bar.
---
Esfand talks to his fans/viewers a lot. His attitude is positive and he‚Äôs a fun host
---
I apologize and take it back.
---
Becsuse you are attracting all the LfM sPeLLcLeAvE 8MaGeS  ppl that  usually either don't give a shit about anyone or anything or are just braindead be sued they did not learn how to actualy play the game
---
pee is stored in the tusks
---
I mean, is it a circlejerk if it's true? I and my group's tank both mained mages from vanilla to Wrath and we can't help but roll our eyes at 9 out of 10 PUG mages we pick up. Some of them have so bought into the spellcleave madness that they will Blizzard and CoC on single targets. One didn't cast one single-target spell for an entire dungeon run. Others pull aggro with AoE, then Frost Nova+Blink to get away, not caring that they've just rooted a heap of mobs within melee distance of our other clothies. It's bad out there.
---
Almost 60 on my rogue with 300skinning but haven't leveled lw yet. I plan on getting my devilsaur set but it's nearly impossible to farm the devilsaur skins on my server. Would it be quicker and more cost efficient to just buy the set on the AH instead of trying to craft my own?
---
Yep, a month in and I pretty much only tank for people on a white list at this point. Fucking too many people who don't tank with an "opinion" on how to tank.
---
Happy cake day
---
I watch Cdew, Xaryu, Towelliee and Bajheera the most.
---
The issue isn't that they're bad, though many are, it's that they abandon the run halfway through.   I am doing UBRS in 45 mins with a semi competent group, so it's not a slog or anything.   These people are just assholes.  They're there for the trinket, and dont give a fuck about anyone else.   
---
We probably spent more time trying to find Jed, and reorganize the raid, than it took to get to him, and they still just bail.
---
it kinda is, if its really low or really high
---
I think you want a slow mainhand (more top end damage) and your off hand can be fast as you want. Try different weapon speeds to see what feels best :)
---
You‚Äôre the only one who makes any sense here. How the fuck was my comment so twisted from its original meaning.
---
edit: People literally just downvoting me for the hell of it lol, well whatever, don't let me stop your fun then you fucking morons.
---
Same, lvl 31 lmao
---
This early, mining / herbalism are good money.
---
Tailoring for robe of void. You can drop it after you make it, but you will need it again when ZG comes out for the bloodvine set bonus.
---
Engineering if you want to do pvp.
---
It's more like Ram Ranch with a bunch of cowboys, please go play that song for clarity
---
Yesterday some dude dueled me. I declined. Shocker right? He called me noob and told me change to a pve server and some more aggresive stuff.
---
Some people are weird af.
---
Hey I‚Äôm not the one hoggin names don‚Äôt take it out on me lol.
---
Only great experience here so far 
---
I don't wanna be that guy but maybe you are not as great of a tank as you think you are? Of course there are always a few ppl that don't understand how tanking works but just tell them to wait and if they don't learn then just let them die (tell the healer not to heal them before) 
---
You are the tank Show some dominance t
---
The DPs are your slaves 
---
On the other hand if you want to DPs then why don't you just say no I will not tank
---
Is it the same social pressure that retail got rid of thanks to personal loot?
---
Just drink, let them run ahead and die. Repeat 2x and they‚Äôll learn.
---
I'm not super experienced with vanilla so take my comment with a grain of salt, but from what I've understood 2h fury is very viable especially with limited hit rating. A slow 2h weapon makes whirlwind/hs hit super hard.
---
I'm a level 60 orc warrior with mining/engineering, and I put off leveling engineering for a while and earned a nice chunk of gold selling mithril/thorium. It might not be smart for later, but it's been nice to get some early gold.
---
Its still possible if your dps are smart enough to wait for a bit for you to build aggro. It doesnt have to be a race to kill him asap
---
It is a given .. especially the first three weeks there was a never ending stream of Stitcheses coming down the road :)
---
Google fury warrior classic leveling build.
---
Hardcore guilds wouldnt really care about this meme weapon. And there is always stuff to spend gold on
---
Yeah .. until your fear gets resisted a few times in a row .....
---
At long last a JOJO reference for classic üôè
---
But I get where you‚Äôre coming from. Hopefully he‚Äôs going to actually make that many characters and play on them. It‚Äôd be cool if they could do what OSRS does. If you don‚Äôt log into your account for 2 years they take your name away and you just pick a new name. Seems fair .
---
2-300= 200 to 300
---
What do you mean holding the server hostage? Whether he plays on there or not? He can play wherever the fuk he wants
---
You can easily dot up every mob if the tank is spreading threat evenly. I know for a fact because I do it as a tank all the time. Locks don't pull off of me. It's when the tank gets distracted and suddenly stops spreading threat that it becomes an issue. Dots by themselves don't generate a lot of threat, it's just constant threat. Shadow bolt generates a lot of threat, searing pain generates a lot of threat. Neither of those spells are used unless it's a boss where I want to put out a lot of dps. The rest of the time its dots and wands/drain life.
---
With some time to spare I want to bring up an alt and have narrowed it down to either warrior or rogue.     
---
I played a rogue back in vanilla so I know that the pvp is fun and that the pve is all right too. It feels like a safe bet to go rogue and I know what I would get. Rogues are also fairly strong with weaker gear so it feels kinda suitable for an alt.     
---
     
---
On the other side is the warrior and I've never played a warrior past lvl 20 so I pretty much have no idea how they are to play but it looks interesting and that the armor and high hp would be a nice change from somebody who pretty much only played leather and cloth in vanilla. They are popular so it must be something about them which is awesome.     
---
I've looked on plenty of vanilla pvp videos to get a feel for how they are too play and Iam a bit confused since they at times seem so slow and just waiting for next attack and the next second the awesomeness come and they crit to left and right. I also think stance dancing seem really hard from what I've seen and I don't quite get it yet.     
---
What would be your advice on how to I can make an decision? Please leave a comment, thanks.
---
better to blind the lock and kill succubus.  I can kill your succubus in less than 9 seconds, trying to kill a warlock that isn't CC'd in 9 seconds is a different story
---
Every interaction I‚Äôve had with Ark has been positive lol. Shitty thing to do, but people who are more than likely not even on the same server Talking shit is a little weird imo
---
Quite a few quests in the north from BB.
---
My new goal now is to become a benign loan shark
---
I'm mostly maining a mage since classic and regulary use CoC on single target because of the +100% crit damage and instant (when the mob is about to die) - this will give you a huge damage push before the mob drops. So not stupid at all.
---
Tried and true
---
If you die as mage u are doing something wrong
---
His name is centipede in Swedish
---
Plus the quests where you have to turn in outside the instance, then go back in.
---
nah even at level 60 the Lich and Abom boss can give you trouble.  It's not really worth farming until 60 and even then it's not great gold/hour
---
Taunt has a 10 second cooldown, is single target, and still requires you to build threat on the mob otherwise it runs off again after only 6 seconds. There is an AOE taunt on a 10 minute cooldown, and it only lasts for 3 seconds. 
---
You are bad.
---
Hot'ing yourself as tank druid is just always good. Gives you heals and more threat and more threat is never a bad thing.
---
Dear lord ele fires are 4gea on my server, hoe many fires per hour is farming here?
---
Ha! Some weeks you‚Äôre probably not far off. Playing games is good for my mental health and with how busy I tend to be I wasn‚Äôt playing any games at all before Classic came along. Paying the sub forces me to play at least bit because I‚Äôm paying for it regularly. So if you add some mental health benefits into the sub per minutes played calculation is works out just fine.
---
Hand of Raggy isnt really a status symbol. We have one on our server I think. I dont recall the guild or name of player I just remember they were made fun of for wasting money. We have an eye in our guild as well but we wont be bothered to fund the cost. Much better items to get for our raiders
---
I've never bought vendor food or asked for mage food. Self sustain is the key. 
---
 That's the way of the road.
---
Ah, good idea about second char, will take awhile tho... Who do you think is the best class for it? Maybe rogue cause of stealth?
---
&gt; and I'd recommend you stop spam whispering people with "inv dps" as a warrior when you aren't what they are asking for.
---
And I'd recommend to not make a conclusions based on guesses or whatnot. I'm a rogue.
---
Rawdogging Sandra Bullock? I'm down with that
---
Every dps class, i can't answer it because I don't know how warrior pvp or pve is
---
4k monitor homie
---
It is literally not.
---
Roll on a PVE server then.
---
As someone with tailoring, I say we ban nudity among all species. Make that ooze get some nice runecloth sweater so that I can collect its scaps.
---
at one point i was too broke to buy those vendor food that healed \~1874 hp so i bought many of those 64 hp foods and spam ate them to full hp
---
All hail the lord of correctness.  Some have opinions, others have the truest of facts,  this man hails truth.  Let no other ideal be spoken, for u/tekno21 has communicated that this particular add-on looks awful, so it must be truth.

What are your movement keys since you have wasd bound to spells?
---
Please validate me! I can't live without your validation and acknowledgement.
---
Warp speed 9 mr Worf !
---
I see the barbarian chain chest. Seems you already got lucky.
---
ah sorry i meant 9*
---
Who?
---
Oh yeah venruki is especially good in pve. Like when his guild wiped at a boss that required decursing and he didnt decurse once and then got mad when people pointed out mages were at fault for not decursing. "Sorry i did so much damage". Lol
---
Yes, which makes it impossible for them to tank many many encounters and anyhting that drops threat just for the tank. Their mana issues are really large as well, but that's nothing compared to being nonfunctional for some encounters period.
---
:O
---
&gt; except that you‚Äôre being a baby about it.
---
How's that?
---
It might have been best for the guild, though. If the warrior is much more likely to stay or actually l complete it.
---
That is why you have a lock friend
---
My friend is Swedish, and every time someone does something exceptionally great or terrible he'll say "that guy's living the Danish life".
---
So I guess it's not all bad, being Danish.
---
Its how gold sellers transfer gold to a buyer. Buyer puts up crap for whatever price and the gold seller buys it. That way they technically cant be accused of buying gold.
---
Hooray for allies on kurinaxx!
---
&gt;Now, so far I have no problems holding aggro, but as I have tanked in every 'expansions' except BFA and Classic, I can't be 100% certain how threat will be/can be in future raids.
---
This is your main problem, Right now there is nothing like a "problem with threat" since everything is tauntable in MC. Later there will be bosses that makes you lose threat aswell as being immune to taunt.
---
And the biggest beaf is that that trinket isnt even good. Arguably Mark of the chosen have more mitigation with its insane uptime. with the dodge from the extra agility and the hp from stamina. And you'll replace it in BWL with the impeding scarab.
---
When you gear like you do with this mindset: (I don't have a problem with threat **Right now**). You're going to end up in a situation where you have problems. and by then its to late, and the raids might struggle while you wait for threat gear. A problem that could be avoided
---
If loot rules were not established he's not a ninja, establish loot rules before your run or you're gonna have a bad time, if the rules are established then broken, whoever broke them is a ninja.

I like your thinking!

5th? Thats pretty casual. We do 40 MCs every week.

One mob. You have to kill one mob

What do they do in bosses? Toss in a 2h and dps a bit?
---
On a leveling Shadow Priest: is it worth it to craft and use an item like [Shadoweave Robe](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12055/shadoweave-robe), that gives 21 Shadow Damage and 7 Spirit instead of going for a robe that gives, let's say, +10 Int and +10 Spirit?
---
Why? I have enough money.

Your saying the improved windfury talent is a whole warrior worth of dps over the standard totem all shamans have access to. Don't think it is tbh.

Blue post from 07
---
"‚Ä¶establishes clear rules for specific loot distribution using channels that are visible to all players (such as party chat or raid chat), then breaks those rules by distributing the loot differently, Blizzard considers it a loot scam."
---
Kinda feels like this relevant to your situation. They go on to say the loot cant be redistributed, but will be destroyed.
---
 You could probably report this guy for loot scamming if you wanted too.
---
As a member of the Alliance on a PvP server, this brings me immense joy.
---
What is your tooltip addon?
---
I escorted a level 6 Night Elf on her run from Menethil Harbor to Ironforge. I offered to help under the guise of being OOC (because I know how much of a pain the run is if you don't graveyard hop)

She started IC, and I had a nice chat (IC) with a Priestess of Elune, about Darnassus, isolation, trade deals, Anduin Wrynn, and how cold Dun Morogh is compared to Teldrassil.

Wait, I just noticed you‚Äôre SnackyBox, I use the name ‚ÄúSnackbox‚Äù on retail. Idk thought it was funny
---
I like to look at it this way. Whether you‚Äôre doing single-target, or aoe. Frostbite is hardly ever essential. It can be nice, but not needed.  
---
So I skipped it because it leaves the option for aoe farming open.
---
I wanna be a tank now
---
zzz
---
Hi there! Rogue main here, id like to ask: What are your goals as a rogue, do you want to eventually participate in end game raids?
---
As a general rule you should focus on either combat with swords, or combat with daggers if you plan on raiding. The reason is that you can only realistically put 5 talents into one of them; either Dagger Specialization or Sword Specialization. To put 5 into each (when you‚Äôre only using one at a time) would be a waste of 5 very valuable talent points.
---
Secondly, sure you can swap weapons. Putting it onto your action bars will work, and it won‚Äôt delete your weapon. Only problem with this is that in order to use the dagger abilities Ambush and Backstab, you need to have a dagger in your MAIN hand. So if you just put the dagger on your bar and press it, it might not always put it in your main hand. 
---
Instead you can make a macro that is programmed to always put the dagger in your main hand. I‚Äôd find one for you but i‚Äôm currently on my phone waiting for someone and about to drive.
---
* You see more than 1 mage
---
* You see any mentions of aoe or spelllcleave or whatnot
---
* Someone's in hurry
---
You leave this shitfest instantly. Those people are the problem, why bother spending time on them and help them get their quests and leveling done?
---
Yeah seriously who goes to LBRS?!
---
Pretty sure this is warrior phenomenon only. As a feral IF afker, nobody ever whispers me to tank anything because half the druids are foolish healers ruining bears' name.
---
premium meme good work
---
Ya was thinking about that - do the higher level herbs still sell for a decent amount? Not sure what the demand for herbs is in classic
---
He could have played alot in a month??
---
Yeah you‚Äôre absolutely right. 3 AM brain failed to see this little detail :)
---
My group called me a stoned edgelord lmao. They thought i was afk when trying to get me to loot the 2nd part of the uldaman key staff and i said sry i was looking at my spell book. They suggested that perhaps i was on pornhub lol. Then i kinda semi away from realitied again and had to come clean and say "i mighta hit the bowl" to which a tauren in my group asked why are all undeads stoned edgelords lol.
---
I really was looking at my spellbook sciencing which rank sw:pain i could spam big packs and not oom
---
Don't join groups, make them. Advertise them as "chill" or "quest" runs. You can also put in non-AOE if you wish. These are all keywords that filter out people who are looking for speed runs. It also has the added advantage of setting the expectation for the kind of run you are actually looking to do. I haven't had a problem putting groups together advertising like this. There are a lot of people who are watching TV or a movie on a second screen or just want a low stress dungeon run. Added bonus if you have a healer friend to make them with. They pretty much make themselves.
---
**Is it actually okay to tank dungeons with pure DPS spec (17/34/0) if I just wear plates and shield?**    
---
I'm planning on getting pre-raid BIS from dungeons as a tank so I can get groups up faster but in raids I would play as DPS. Being DPS would also make it easier to do open world content.    
---
My point is to avoid respeccing as much as possible but I also wouldn't like to make it impossible for other group members to play with tank like this. For now I'm Fury/Protection Defiance tank (0/32/19) with hit cap and I have good amount of experience from tanking from retail and classic aswell.
---
Depends on how your guild does loot and shit. Imo right now the best way is to have every class roll at the start highest has first dibs on tier gear, if he doesn't want it goes to the second highest whoever takes the item goes to the bottom of the list, can save the list for next raid if you have a core group. Non set pieces you just roll for 1 per person. Legendaries and shit can be loot council. It's only MC and Ony at this point there really isn't a reason to track attendence and do dkp spreadsheets at this phase.
---
Level 38 Hunter here in stv, can confirm. I swear anything over 41 is a shit show
---
I mean, mages can blink stuns every 15 seconds, and yes you can aoe a rogue out of vanish immediately.
---
Rogues are strong yeah, but not unbeatable. Whereas a good mage should (on paper) beat literally every other class in the game.
---
Did you send this to him?
---
Damage is king especially when leveling and especially as a spriest with wands + spirit tap. The time you save killing mobs faster more than makes up for the int/spirit loss.
---
Not even that. They pull before the tank then expect them to run around with no rage and fix it.
---
Def seems horde dominated everywhere i go
---
r/theydidthemonstermath

Works perfectly, thanks. If I wanted to take the spells cooldown into account too would it just be this?

---
I completed the Murloc quest in tirisfal ONCE. Never again will I do that quest.
---
Priest more fun imo but I say go for a melee class to keep it different!
---
If you hear it a lot it‚Äôs probably true because it‚Äôs the first thing I thought of telling you when I heard your mini-spaz rant about how everyone else is the problem but you.
---
You have a lot of different tools depending on the situation. Fel hunters can dispel and cancel spells from enemy casters and succubus can cc. Think of what is most useful against your enemies and pull that out instead of statically using the same demon all the time.
---
Applies to Gnomish engineering as well?
---
186 runs and I saw HoJ drop. I made the grp so I though I was the only one that needed it. So no need to reserve it.
---
Warriortank, irl friend
---
Rogue, me
---
Mage, random
---
Priest, random
---
Hunter, random.
---
We killed Angerforge for the 186th time and it dropped, I was so happy, its hard to explain. I rolle need ofcourse and was waiting for it to be in my inventory...
---
.. Then the Hunter won it and said it was an upgrade cause he only had carrot on a stick and 20 AP was good for him.
---
Needless to say, that Hunter was kicked from grp and put on ignorelist by me and my whole guild.
---
What are you talking about
---
Here is a tip how it works best: 
---
Be a class that's usually not taken for perfect group composition. Get UBRS Key and look for a Jed ID. 
---
Once you have one - form a group around it. 
---
Everyone profits. You Rogue/DPS Warrior get your chance at Rend. Casters are flocking to you for their chance at the trinket and there are no waiting times.
---
Wait...
---
 Why is being Swedish a bad thing?
---
&gt;
---
Because he's not a mage himself?
---
Ah yeah I could see that making them useful for only trash pulls or certain encounters.  I don't really know the ins and outs of pallies for classic because I only ever played Horde in vanilla.
---
Is it weird that I am having tons of fun, but I have 6 characters over level 25, but none over 35? I love the pace between 10 and 30.
---
I'm not entirely sure if it exists in classic or not, but you  might have to ask a mage to cast Arcane Linguist on you so that you can translate all his gibberish.
---
If you report this it will lead to a permanent ban. IRL death threats are not taken lightly by Blizzard.
---
Gear dependent to do what exactly? To top the DPS meters? To survive raids? To PvP?
---
That was my final and best weapon I got in vanilla. I still remember getting it. Spent all my dkp on it in MC. I must have used it for close to a year before being replaced in BC.
---
Is it worth spending the time trying to get Cruel Barb from Deadmines when I already have [this sword in my mainhand?](https://i.gyazo.com/839def57d5e2b1182df6fc0b830ce616.png) I'll just be using it for leveling and not PvP.
---
Most likely a melee hunter for fun/memes, I've been seeing them A LOT since Classic released, same with melee boomkins and tanking hunters that stack int/healing gear and their pet tanks everything including dungeons
---
Isn't 15 years of game knowledge great? Been seeing people do the craziest things! haha
---
Honestly even if you knew NOTHING about WoW, the Illustrations of him are so good, they make perfect art to put anywhere you want, including above your aquarium.
---
How do you re-stealth and bandage with a pet hacking at you every 0.7 seconds? A pet that cant be CCed for a whole 18 seconds.
---
I tried  it yesterday and it didn't work.
---
It's alright in the same way WoW's current story is alright. If you can turn off your brain entirely and not think about the plot, you'll probably have a good time because the two leads have nice chemistry between them.
---
But honestly, why settle for that? Why bother watching a movie that's only tolerable at best, a movie that takes an interesting premise and then does absolutely nothing of interest with it? There's far better and more enjoyable things you can do with your time.
---
Wait how? Isn't it soulbound?
---
Fyi you forgot to censor one of the names
---
Preference between sm/ruin or Soul link.
---
Kill it it has no health
---
Here's a tip, fuck jed.   Go join a fucking rend/jed run, and stay the fuck away from my full ubrs clears.   The only way to avoid these cancerous pirated server cocksuckers is to tell them to stay away.
---
U can sit on it till its ancient but youre not gonna get the hundreds of gold reddit promised
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem. Either you run Jed/Rend runs or you don‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre sick of it, run a normal run? Never heard anyone ask to find Jed in a normal run :0
---
Chickens move slower than run but faster than walk so thats okay
---
&gt; GetSpellCooldown(s)
---
I think you just have to replace the s with z and it should do it
---
Glad it's working correctly!
---
&gt;Considering I am statistically the #1 rogue
---
Top percentage of ~~rattatas~~ rogues?
---
yeah, it's just regular engineering, not a speciality.
---
For any rogue nearing the 60s, I recommend checking the AH for Serpentine Sash from time to time. I got a pretty close to BiS belt for 9 Gold.
---
Still got Tribal Feathers of course
---
For pure farming and quick leveling I always used hunters. Your pet can take care of mobs while you harvest a node. And leveling is rather easy with them, too.
---
How do you get that number?
---
When I calculate, I use  **(1/100) ^ 5 * 5! * 96** and get 1/868,055
---
Wtf is any of this supposed to mean?
---
No one is obligated to help you. Some people have little to no time to play. The more you rage and yell at people to help you the less likely it‚Äôs gonna happen. If someone has 60 minutes to play maybe they don‚Äôt want to spend those 60 minutes running around getting owned with you.
---
That's a really mean way to say, "if you farm other things for gold instead of directly farming essences you can acquire all your essences in a fraction of the time!"
---
A tUrTLe mADe iT tO thE wAtER
---
Don't joke around about that Fine Aged Cheddar. Treasure cheese is serious business!!
---
The "should I get ready for a screenshot" and "post to Reddit" just makes this cringeworthy
---
Oh look Arreat Summit. Also in this guild!!
---
I'd say no, you will replace it sooner or later anyway. No worth grinding just for that.
---
As i stated, if you need reckoning to get enough threat, you have other issues, as your gear is probably not good enough to survive a double parry 3x in your face hit by any big mean mob.
---
That's why you level as arms and tabk as arms until the harder endgame dungeons. You never level as prot. 
---
The talents in prot are not worth the early levels
---
Is the War talent Anger Management the original bugged version or did they fix it to change it to match the tooltip?
---
(In vanilla it just added a rage regen and ignored combat, so while in combat you slowly gained rage.)
---
Why are you sheeping things? Stop it, I want the rage.
---
Counterspell on the other hand I will love you forever.
---
‚ÄúGod I love gays,‚Äù writes RavagerHughesy
---
It does not give you the choice in pug random dungeons, because no warrior tank would join a group with another DPS warrior.
---
a) the tank will assume the warrior is a noob and slacking for not tanking
---
b) the tank does not want to compete for gear if he can LFM once and have 5 rogues whisper him for invite
---
Sounds good
---
Man sounds like a better option would be to free up some time in your life by just getting rid of that pesky family. Tell em to take a hike you gotta get your classic on. In all seriousness though that‚Äôs a real bummer. Have a close friend who is also missing out because he started med school right as classic released and simply can‚Äôt find time to play, so I really do fee for you.
---
resist resist resist resist resist resist
---
There are some vendors that sell scrolls with a limited amount. You can Google those, but they aren't a reliable source. (The one from Darkmoon faire isn't even in the game yet)
---
I still don't understand how you don't know what meta means. It's 2019 not 2004 after all.
---
Oh then fuck it.  lol thank you.
---
Gank her hard till she drops loot
---
Yeah that is perfectly fine. I have been tanking 5 and 10 mans fine and also offtanked mc and onyxia without issues
---
is it strictly worth it in terms of how much it will improve your leveling speed? no, probably not. is it worth it for the cool factor and satisfaction of having the most badass low level sword in the game? fuck yeah, imo.
---
I‚Äôm a warrior dps when I lfg, I advertise as ‚Äúdps lfg etc etc‚Äù and then, I get invited in a group and party leader asked if I have a shield and if I could tank.. 
---
At first, it used to annoy me but now I don‚Äôt mind. At level 48, I‚Äôve learned how to tank, get the gear I‚Äôm wanting so far, and created new folks to play with.
---
Yeah I tried it again and it's all messed up.  forget that.
---
Can you recommend an add on name that would tel me, please? Appreciate the help
---
&gt; üëÄ it's a pvp server
---
Tip - Tac. I love it so much customization
---
If the population were more balanced, I‚Äôd really love the PVP server experience. Most days I still love it, even on Skeram. But I have finally come to realize that it is a problem on this server and there are problems on both sides making the experience worse. 
---
I mainly came here because my IRL friends have a guild here, which unfortunately is already starting to die out a bit. I feel stuck, but I‚Äôve put so much time into this toon and giving it a full leveling experience with professions and all dungeon blues and everything. I‚Äôll at least push onward to 60 before deciding what to do. I want to at least reach level cap and do what I can to fight the horde.
---
Hrmm wowpro vanilla...  thanks.  I'm going to check it out.
---
You need to stop being bad.
---
1 in 83,333,333 is the first calculation I've seen in this thread that matches my own calculation(except without accounting for other sequences of numbers)
---
I enjoy Asmongold. I enjoy his general cockyness and the fact that he doesnt stop talking. Hes an asshole through and through and i think thats funny. Im glad hes not on my server though.
---
As a pally  just give yourself 2-3 holy lights and you got initial aggro..
---
Depends on what you mean by OK. I'm doing it, and my guildies are very geared. We make it work, but it's kind of janky, and I find that I have to dw for extra threat a lot of the time.
---
When I first got to 60, I met this Priest &amp; Warrior duo in Un-goro.
---
We quested together and then we started to raid dungeons together.
---
We're both fury warriors but somehow I got to tank, so on our first BRD run, Ironfoe dropped, and I lost the roll.
---
That's when I decided I'll not be having other warriors in my group again.
---
Your DPS will be higher as tank than as a melee DPS warrior, because as a tank you gain lots of rage from being hit while the DPS warrior rage generation is abyssmal until level 60 or windfury totem.
---
You can literally tank 90% of any dungeon with a 2hander up until sunken temple.
---
By not tanking you do
---
a) less damage than the tank who gets hit for rage
---
b) waste your own time
---
c) bitch about not being taken along in groups
---
Also need to kill 6ish I think for a quest.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about it like that. I'm a rogue and a few guildies and I ran DM and it dropped, but at the last minute one of my other guildies decided he needed it too and he won :(
---
You should refuse. Either bring a shadow priest or less warlocks. Gimping a healer is demeaning
---
Protip: If you report a name until the name will get eventually changed, the name will be locked for anyone.
---
Depending what you play, it might hardly make a difference.  No grind for mount is the big one, i suppose
---
GL getting healers or casters. Like you want to run it for fun and arent interested in the loot.
---
You should join your server‚Äôs Discord for the best overview of your options.
---
People will randomly PvP you a lot more when the honor system comes out right? Does the game turn in to *"kill everyone on sight"* pretty much?
---
Generally most people use the term grind when it‚Äôs for XP, at least in most circles I play with. Either way, some classes excel at multi target farms, Mages, Locks and Paladins all to certain degrees. You‚Äôre a dick if you fuck with one of their grinds spot. And so you‚Äôre a dick if you fuck with the spread out ST grinds such as whelps. 
---
Just respect the other players grind every class excels somewhere.
---
Mages can make gold faster than almost any other class, has consistently high DPS, great in PvP/Duels, portals/teleports and have lower costs than just about any other class in the game 
---
Warriors like you said have multiple viable choices at end game, but from 1 - 59 are outperformed in one aspect or another by just about every class significantly.
---
Ownage time lol
---
Ok, but then why roll pvp server if you are actively trying to avoid pvp all the time? We‚Äôre a team, and everyone chose to be on this team in a pvp enabled environment. If people only want to quest when they log in, shouldn‚Äôt THEY be on pve servers?
---
Going as tank the first go round is pretty bold. Not so much because it's hard, but because each group needs someone to stop people from doing dumb stuff and wasting time unnecessarily. Normally this is the tank, since they are generally the limiting factor in the run. If you are new, it is harder to tell when people are doing an actually viable strategy or just being dumb. My suggestion would be to whisper your healer that you are new, so if they see people doing something they don't agree with they should feel free to call them out and you'll back them up.
---
Go farm the air elementals in North Western Silithus.  More specifically, the ones on the east side.  They have a very high spawn rate which leads to very little down time.  They drop essences of airs which probably sell for at least 10 gold on your server and allow you to make 20-30g per hour while gaining experience.  Also from my experience, the horde and alliance are very friendly there.  Good luck with the last bit of your journey.
---
1.2e-8
---
The sooner you let go of the painfully slow 1 mob at a time, cc everywhere days the happier you will become.
---
Pretty sure it still does that.
---
The blues typically vendor for a few gold, you don‚Äôt need to disenchantment them. Part of the appeal is there‚Äôs no competition compared to camping devilsaurs to skin for example.
---
He broke the loot rules, as per the EULA you can report him and he'll likely get a week's suspension minimum.
---
Also what fucking excuse is that? "Since we don't have any enhancement shamans, except the dude who is an enhancement shaman, we're going to give it to someone else." What???
---
So you are going to deny casters and healers their BiS trinket? Kind of a dick move if you ask me
---
except with certain (usually pvp oriented) builds, it's generally not really worth it to swap your main hand between sword and dagger for ambushes. and unless you're building for backstab specifically, you're likely better off just sticking with swords + sinister strike even in groups where you can reliably be behind the enemy. it can be fun to break out a dagger from time to time to fish for those big ambush crits though!
---
Thanks. :)
---
I have not tanked that much yet, just all instances to level 40 (so up to all SM besides Cath, and RFK). Until now I have had like 1 bad experience tanking. Sure, there's always people AoEing. Always ppl DPS'ing the non-skull target so taunt is always on CD. But all in all, its been a good experience. Especially I have had a blast when tanking instances were I wasn't really high enough level for it,  and I ran with teams that was ok taking it slowly, a mage actually sheeping stuff, a priest using shackle, really nice. Think I have had 3-4 wipes  all in all so far (out of those, 2 in the dreaded in the goblin room in DM...).
---
&gt; there is no reliable way to find him early on
---
Untrue. Go to top of ramp, /tar Jed every few seconds for two minutes. He has about a 15 second window every two minutes that you can get him.
---
5/5 cruelty 
---
5/5 unbridled rage
---
5/5 improved battle shout or 4/5 and 1 pt into piercing howl 
---
5/5 enrage 5/5 flurry 
---
1/1 deathwish 
---
5/5 dual wield spec 
---
1/1 blood thirst 
---
That should be 32 talents. 
---
Then switch to arms and go 3/3 improved rend, 2/3 imp hero strike, 5/5 tactical mastery, 3/3 deep wounds, 2/2 imp overpower, 2/2 impale. 
---
Switch back to fury and put your last 2 points into imp execute. 
---
You‚Äôll pretty much be in berserker stance most of the time. Blood thirst and whirlwind. Heroic strike to dump excess rage. Execute under 20%. 
---
It‚Äôs a fun spec. Probably not as optimal as a 2H.. but if you get a lucky string of hits/crits it can sometimes do better. But it‚Äôs all RNG. 
---
Make sure you‚Äôre using strong weapons, and a slow weapon in your main hand.
---
Meh take it as a lesson learned and move on. Join your own guild or run with guildies only
---
Mate like 90% of the gear from ubrs is physical dps oriented and you're gonna cry about casters wanting a reason to go outside of quests? Give your head a shake and get off ur high horse lmao. I'm not even a caster but I do what I can do make it worth other people's times and this is something small you can do.
---
yeah MOBAs are wayyyy more tilting than WoW for me
---
&gt; Using the reset exploit
---
It's not an exploit, Blizzard implemented the ability to reset dungeons.
---
By your logic as the group member who already joined the group before the rules were changed, the group leader also could change the loot rules at an arbitrary time after the group was assembled?   
---
No ninja looting possible, because accept the group leader call or gtfo of the group?
---
oh no it‚Äôs a gnome. PUNT IT
---
O think I invoked Satan by giving you the 666th upvote
---
Whats the Addon showing health numbers?
---
Many classes "gimp" their own performance for the good of the raid.  This situation is no different.
---
Proud.
---
I honestly think reporting people like this is the only way  alot of people in the community might learn to fucking stop doing shit like this. And even if people don't learn this kind of behaviour deserves punishment.
---
I narrowly managed as 43 but my god the last few rooms were rough. I won't be going back until 45 so I can farm for a weapon.
---
He's the ultimate douchebag
---
If you're in a group of 2+ mages (and maybe a single warlock if they didn't find another mage) you can go for massive AoE trashpulls.
---
You bodypull about 3-4 groups and let mages handle them.
---
You should only focus on elite mobs wich are immune to CC and taunt them specificly. I really like this kind of tanking since you don't farm repair costs and can handle adds, patrols or failpulls pretty well.
---
I came for this, thank you sir!
---
That  build is for raid dps ideally. Arms is way better for lvling and dungeon dps. 2 reasons, the first being sweeping strikes, which is glorious for leveling and dps. Way better than death wish, which you can't really use for solo play anyway. 
---
The second is that mortal strike scales with weapon damage and AP, while bloodthirst scales only to AP.
---
AP really balloons at 60, but before then, when you have a slow current lvl 2hander, mortal strike will easily outdamage bloodthirst.
---
I have 300 Mining and 300 Herbalism and got like 600g in about 10 days by only selling Arcane Crystals and Black Lotuses and Thorium Ingots. I still have over 10 stacks of Dreamfoil and tons of other herbs and ores left.
---
I know it's not much it's fairly easy. Just ride around a high level map with rich thorium veins and black lotus and that's it. If you are going to main prot war, it's even better, since you won't have to fight any mobs.
---
Also get the Barov Peasant Caller if you can. I use it to distract elite wyrmkins while I go for the Black Lotus in Burning Steps and it works like a charm.
---
And retail dungeons are? You don‚Äôt even lose health. As a warrior you don‚Äôt even need taunt lol, you just rush and pull 10 mobs and never lose aggro. Try that in classic and show me how it was. You obviously don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.
---
Nice! As a rogue what did you find the best levelling? I‚Äôm about to hit 40 on my rogue.
---
The first thing I turned off after returning. Nowadays ground clutter just gives me a headache. Couldn‚Äôt stand it.
---
I mean, that's cool, but the topic was the other healer complaining about the tank using Rav instead of a shield and taking extra damage. I was just saying you don't have any other choice if you want to keep threat off other Rav warrior dps and Mages. Hell, even then you still lose threat a fair amount. 
---
I love Bear tanks, but they have an even harder time keeping threat. Luckily, most of the time we get a Bear tank people have behaved, but that's rarely the case with warrior tanks. People go balls-to-the-wall with AoE and Ravager is the only option for even getting rage, much less keeping threat.
---
This person clearly says they're doing full runs.   They're not sick of Jed runs, because they're not doing them.  
---
95%+ runs I do of UBRS, full clears, there's people dropping group to find Jed.  We almost always find him too.  It's not hard.  I have no clue what you are talking about.
---
You all keep making up pretend answers to a problem that the player can not control at all.  The problem is that the horde are so much more populous than alliance on many pvp realms that ever pvp encounter is 3v1 or 5v2 or worse.  You say ask for help but there is no one to help.  The population just isnt there.  This isnt a git gud issue.  When the population skews past 60/40 the game becomes unplayable.  No one should want this.  This is when servers slowly die on one faction.  It isnt healthy.
---
There are also different systems who mix it up and take the best out of both.
---
Loot council is obscure and you can't track like you can with DKP which has trackable points, everything transparent.
---
DKP allows slackers to achieve stuff without contributing to the entirety of the guild like progressing the gong quests. It also encourages raid logging, because your only way of earning DKP is in raids.
---
Here comes EQDKP into play. Contribute to the guild outside the raid with consumable farming, rep grinding etc. and earn DKP in a transparent way.
---
I always look for EQDKP first.
---
Some solo devilsaur farm, which was maybe the majority. Never really want to do it again though, most toxic thing in the game possibly. 
---
Also got a rare recipe for a red dragonscale chest which made me a decent chunk of change as it is basically BiS for resto shamans for raids. And the mats are really cheap. 
---
Quests and dungeons was the rest.
---
1. They are ranting about it in-game on Trade channel, etc. 
---
2. I have about 40 friends I‚Äôve made from groups, but possibly many of them transferred out, seems like only 2-3 log in regularly. And everyone‚Äôs leveling pace is different so they aren‚Äôt always in the same zones.

3. I always try to lead and recruit for defense groups. A few weeks ago it was easy to get people to group up and we could take certain spots back. But now everyone has their tail between their legs and won‚Äôt join any counterattack groups I try to start. Alliance is acting like we‚Äôve lost already, morale is super low.
---
Yep, 48 here. Been playing for 13~ years, just super burnt out and spent a lot of time doing everything but levelling and grinding gold.
---
Dirty dogs are coming for dat ass
---
So many absolute losers out there. It's apparent that the only way to ensure greed doesn't prevail and you're not taken advantage of - if you TRULY have functioning morality - make your own guild.
---
Was going through BRD yesterday, with someone's wife... After 30 minutes into the dungeon she left because baby woke up))
---
In WoW definitely.
---
I've started doing almost exclusively quests that are 2-4 levels below the level I'm at, and it's actually made leveling and questing significantly faster and easier. The quests take WAY, *WAY* less time and in the end you're still getting about the same amount of xp. I've even roadmapped which zones I'm doing next based on this. Green is good!
---
And I feel you on dungeons - I've been pretty much just running each leveling dungeon one time to get my quests done and moving on. Level 45 and haven't needed to grind at all yet.
---
He can‚Äôt answer that.
---
They are just here to down play another persons issues and nitpick details. It‚Äôs Reddit after all.
---
EU, Morgraine

And Horde, just crafted it

---
Nice recommendations, man! Already got Esfand from others, but Savixx seems REALLY chill! Super nice :D
---
staysafe seems professional (getting ManvsGame vibes) and very interactive. 
---
Will check Cdew out later!
---
Again, thanks!

What is root?

FFS keep your shitty twitch dramas to twitch.

---
Tauren riding a kodo does not swim.
---
Why are you leveling as prot on a pvp server? Reroll arms and you'll be flexible enough to survive pvp and still tank dungeons.
---
You alliance or horde?
---
Thank you for all your help! I've found that Classic is a lot more enjoyable so far too.
---
Type in the chat window /move ToolTip then you  can just drag it over, if you have moveanything installed.
---
This is exactly why I made a rogue.
---
It's fairly easy to me to indefinitely stun lock people until they're dead.
---
Cheap Shot, Gouge, Kidney Shot, Blind, Vanish, repeat.
---
Even if one gets resisted or blocked, I can just move down the line to the next stun.
---
The biggest issues are things like Frost Nova and hunter kiting. Finally hit level 41 so I can start putting points into utility talents that will improve the situation, though.
---
Except it wastes 30 minutes of everyone's time to do the exploit to find him.  How is that not selfish?   They don't fucking need it anyways.   It's not like this is some kind of emergency situation.  it's an insignificant amount of healing/spell damage that almost certainly won't matter.
---
Hol up
---
We are witnessing a griefer be born.
---
29 same for me ! And plenty of things to look after ! I have been playing retail until end of BC and coming back to vanilla it is some much nostalgia and good filling. (Dont say that to my wife)
---
If you can raise a ticket and give times in chat I‚Äôm sure they can check logs on the matter. Bonus points if you have screenshots.
---
Nah
---
I will kill at least a dozen Horde lowbies as a direct consequence of this comment üòâ
---
It basically traumatized me, and now I'm dreading BRD.
---
I mean, multiple quests for that dungeon require 3 separate runs. They definitely planned for it
---
Kill quests and collect quests are different
---
U my friend just started a downward spiral in your marriage that will end in disaster.

---
There's barely a reason for any casters to want to go to UBRS as is outside of quests, and the trinket is BiS for all of them.
---
Honestly if you're putting the group together, do a check before you start the run, if you don't find him, as you add people make them check. By the time the group is together, you should have a jed. 
---
If people drop mid run, blacklist them and don't group with them again.   
---
Imagine if the boss holding your BiS loot was random spawn with an easy way to check, but people still expected you to come run it with them without checking.   
---
This game is ultimately about gearing up, why would anyone come to a run where you aren't getting a chance to do that?
---
Not a big deal, but I felt like I need to defend myself in saying that it was indeed the first time i'd come across the bug, I can upload the 2 minute shadowplay clip if wanted :p
---
whats the fishing addon at the right?
---
I always go Darkshire. Going to have to try this other way.
---
Seen it listed for 420 on a few servers. Just sit on it, that‚Äôs huge.
---
Desto got hit talents at about 30
---
It‚Äôs true, as a student I have dedicated a lot of my time to this game, I‚Äôve got somewhere around 16 days played. I do not recommend this, but compared to some of the people in my guild, this can be considered ‚Äúlate‚Äù. 
---
Play at your own pace, never rush anything if it‚Äôs not gonna be worth it.
---
Pretty much yep.
---
Oh no, people ask me to play the role I chose to play
---
How awful
---
Au revoir, Shoshanna!
---
How is it an exploit?
---
its called Fishbringer :)
---
Unintended gameplay, exploit.
---
On Stalaag, guild noted and blacklisted :) Fuck em.
---
Guild named Team Teamwork are also ninja looters.
---
The fact that they helped speaks to the anarchy no?
---
Having a dagger spec with hemo is great in raids.  Buffs all the other melee damage.
---
Been lvl 53 for 4 days now. Tsk tsk
---
I leveled a priest alt until 36 and then swapped to hunter (now 45) partly because I freaking adore hunters, and I want to add: You have little to no downtime with the wand spec people are recommending, but wanding things down also just takes forever. That's really the crux of things - I'd suggest just planning out your leveling and questing routes so you're overleveled for things by 2-3 levels, and it'll be easy breezy and very efficient.
---
Generally you get in touch with the guild leader and have a chat.
---
Nobody is paying that rn, the tank shortage isn't that bad at the moment and everyone is broke as fuck or saving for mounts still. Best I'm able to do is reserve the first orb in live strat.
---
Alts man, this is a baaaad idea.
---
Honestly my mother was a nurse and I'm an only child so I live with her. I help her out and she needs me (and I her) so I'm no burden on her. I could work to spend my time more productively but being around people is such a drain on my energy.
---
Honestly I ask for 20g to tank when it's not a guild run. Tanks spend 2-4g just in repairs and it's just a basic economics scenario. There are more groups looking for tanks than tanks.
---
Are free transfers still open? One of the choices is an Ally dominated server and being in the dominant faction is pretty similar to being on a pve realm. Which is why the Skeram horde telling Alliance to "get gud" is so hilarious. As if the Horde didn't have enough advantages, they are playing easy mode.
---
Consensus on previous comments seems to be that 2h fury is the way to go for raiding Horde warriors, because of windfury totem.
---
Bad bot
---
If you mean ‚Äúmagic the gathering‚Äù then no, I do not.
---
But.... What else can you do?
---
Do you have 40 friends who play WOW?
---
I never got into WoW rp in the past but I'm going ahead with it this time in classic. Spontaneous rp out in the world tends to be the most fun, I think.
---
Hunter. What you wrote in your comment is objectively false as explained in the comment you were replying to
---
Why punish an entire guild of players because the GM is a dildo?
---
That just makes you look dumb, too.
---
Horde
---
Or worst of all, there ARE people to help, but they‚Äôd rather pretend they can stay neutral on a pvp server, or be a smart alec on general chat about another player suffering
---
Points out of piercing ice and into ele perscision and frost channeling is my exact build and I'm clearing mc each week.
---
You really need the hit for pvp, only 1 point thoughm (max rank is optimal for pve but takes too many points)
---
Go read the thread like ten lines down with the same name and see what the answers were there.
---
And every other class you've grouped with has been at the top of their game at all times?
---
Horde has windfury. Its still worse than dw, but not by a lot, to the point that any difference in skill will put you ahead of an equal geared dw fury.
---
Plus, there's a lot of competition for 1handers.
---
4th phase rag HC walks around, coz the ancients stop him from retreating into the lava
---
Probably the only ones you can kill
---
Go for mobs 2 level below you, arms specc of course. for 41 I guess Swamp of sorrows / arathi / desolace, then duskhollow, feralas, tanaris, hinterlands. Get the quests for ZF around 45 / 46 and for maraudon 48/49. Farm maraudon for the ring and axe and other items. At 46-49 get  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7862/job-opening-guard-captain-of-revantusk-village](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7862/job-opening-guard-captain-of-revantusk-village) , if you are horde (It takes about 3-4 hours, depending on the group. Also get the other elite quests AND zf hammer quest and  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3520/screecher-spirits](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3520/screecher-spirits) )
---
Can confirm, I am much less ganked when i play my Tauren Druid and /moo around.
---
If you find a fool who would _really_ spend 200g on that item, tell me. I have some useless stuff to sell, too :)
---
He broke loot rules. Contact a gm and ask if they can ban him and give you the item instead of it being terminated. Leave that shit guild once you've gotten the legendary.
---
BiS is an actual upgrade, as opposed to a placeholder, which you newb asses demand because it is purple, you regressive scrub
---
Rule \#1 - Keep your streamer shit on their own channel.
---
You're supposed to kite them, not facetank just because your pet can't land attacks.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this will help you but sometimes my RMB (to turn my char) didn‚Äôt react.
---
Tried all sort off things cleaning mouse, using contact spray, adjusting the polling, even buying a new mouse, etc.. Nothing worked. 
---
The solution was as simple as idiotic for me..,
---
I have a bar addon (dominos), the used bars with the spells are put where I need them, the other empty ones were put somewhere in the middle of my screen. They were invisible but still ‚Äúactivated‚Äù which means when my pointer hovered over the bars it didn‚Äôt detect my screen but the bars instead = no reaction = no turning of my toon.
---
As soon as I adjusted the position of those bars to where my pointer doesn‚Äôt hover over my problem was solved. RMB worked fine and toon turned and reacted as it should. I even did the test with my ‚Äúbroken‚Äù mouse and it worked flawlessly. 
---
Hopes this help other people too.
---
I'm sure you'd find a lot of people willing until they get everything they need, so turnover would be an issue.
---
Nope. This is one of the debuffs that are worth having.
---
Or just use the bombs from un goro
---
Check the AH for prices but there is always some fool who will pay more that it is worth to equip an item. So the question is, are you that fool?
---
I only use bows and in rare cases xbows on my nightelves. A gun is the most un-nightelfish weapon there is.
---
\+128
---
It will run without any problems, you just have to tone down the graphics a bit.
---
So they are peer pressured into ostracizing the gm and subsequently leaving the guild.
---
It's not exploiting lol.
---
After battlegrounds come, twinks will pay more than 200 for it, right now i can't sell it 200 i need to wait for people to make gold.
---
And you have enough money how?
---
stoneraven is also a good replacement if you have bad luck in maraudon
---
\+4096
---
It works:
---
1. Camp lowbies in Hillsbrad
---
2. They will call their lvl 60 friends to help
---
3. You just pulled some of the horde from other zones and made space
---
why are you even talking to him, he is clearly botting right now
---
Ive seen a couple of toons in that guild, even if they have more alts, they will never beat a Bank from the Horde to the Horde!
---
We have hard working Bankers that want to achieve financial stability and growth thru hard work and dedication, Beat that! :D
---
It's like you said, need is for need right now with the variable of being able to use it next level / it's your profession / you need to get the training (weapon).
---
Everything else is greed unless otherwise stated (usually in guild runs).
---
Everything else is personal greed and a player trying to hustle the group.
---
If you see a hunter needing on say a priest item, for example, or needing on more then 1 item that you know that they don't use (mistakes sometimes happen) then that hunter should no longer be in the group and if they are you should be needing on their hunter items.
---
Anyone who says otherwise is bulls***ing you to get items. Period.
---
-cheers
---
Rule 3 (of this actual platform where you actually are posting this):
---
&gt; **No witch hunts or brigading.** Don‚Äôt encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community. Names must be blurred if people are portrayed in a negative light.
---
:D
---
Max your rage, get a gray weapon, spam hamstring
---
Mainly because Jed has the only drop casters want in UBRS.
---
Awesome, thanks man :D
---
No. Unless you're a mage with detect magic
---
How do you find a damn guild to main tank for?  I'm looking around and every slot is taken with a waiting list
---
There is a sleep command right? Should work with a sleep command in the middle
---
I entirely agree and this makes sense to me. The reason I'm tempted is primarily for damage reasons, as the shatter crits from frostbite procs are significant. But this is really dps vanity, and the utility of aoe farming is worth it.
---
I always for the opposite idea. I played both side quite extensively (classic as horde, tbc as ally as i wanted to try paladins)
---
Allied races is where i found the most childish players (behaviour-wise) as well.
---
Damn thats ass... but see you get my point though. That shit SUCKS. Ill move on of course but the point is justice for the people that have been ninja looted from.. with the classic servers un merged theres only so many people and guilds on there.. I see the same people constantly and i feel like if theres a community system to blacklist ninja looters and scumbag toxic guilds/players it would make them think twice about doing it again.. idk just venting i suppose lol
---
I have ret paladin and tank everything.
---
Using salvation is enough to migate the disadvantage of having worse righteous fury
---
All need is a better system. There is no chance for the item to be ninjaed and everyone gets a chance at the windfall. 
---
But the older tradition is well ingrained so it's best to communicate about these things before items start dropping. People aren't likely to become more reasonable after.
---
Harvest Moo
---
I like how they ask for a tank for the "last spot".
---
Sometimes seen as "just need a tank and gtg!" -- so in other words, lacking the only difficult to obtain part of a group.
---
If someone with the same raid lockout enters a raid in a different group, no other groups can do the raid since they get ported out after 1 minute because they "aren't in a raid group".
---
If someone raided with the guild earlier in the week, they can form a raid group (just 1 other person) and sit inside the raid to prevent any other groups with the same raid lockout from doing it.
---
Depends on how you look at it, does selling the item towards something you could use count as needing it?
---
The loot system is need before greed, for BoP items this is logical because their value for selling is low. For BoE the sell value can often be alot higher and fund other upgrades.
---
In my opinion someone who needs to use it should get first priority and not someone who wants to sell it for something else. Though honestly I've seen greedy practises becoming much more widespread here in classic than in retail.
---
Yeah I thought if their level was gray it didn't count. Could be wrong.
---
Will apply when i get online
---
What does consistent mean in terms of MC and Onyxia? Pugs clear them easily and consistently. On the other hand, consistency with a guild means raiding on the same night each week even when it's not convenient for you.
---
Yeah, why didn't I think about it? I should partake in PvP, you're right! Next time, I am in Silithus as a holy paladin in my sub-par farming gear doing less damage than a lvl40 rogue I will charge alone into the pack of warlocks/mages/warriors who are farming the elementals and "partake in PvP".
---
My advice If you horde roll a shaman. you can tank up to scarlet monastery. I got in every group I wanted.
---
Playing shaman feels like being the prettiest girl in the prom2
---
I'm starting to think that this is all extreme exaggerated. Ask yourself how many good mages you've meet (in terms of giving things out for free) and how many negative. 
---
I'm casting water and food for everyone that is asking - and you get many many whispers, half of the time you are just casting water and food for people that are asking you instead of farming. Some of them even added me to just ask me for food and water whenever I'm going online. Also while walking to the instance portal, I cast so many water and food for everyone, that they still will have enough to do another 1-2 instances. Also making an OG portal after every run.
---
Well I certainly couldn‚Äôt force them to stay, but replacing those individuals probably wouldn‚Äôt be hard at all. The idea behind this is that the dungeons are actually beautifully crafted and have so many cool nooks and crannies to explores and I feel like so much of it is rushed and ignored just to farm those ‚Äúpre-raid BIS‚Äù. I suppose having some kind of interview process wouldn‚Äôt hurt to gauge a person‚Äôs intent, but again, the risk is low because finding a replacement could be done almost immediately in LFG...(assuming the person leaving would impact the ‚Äúraid schedule‚Äù).
---
Me: *Fires an arrow into a group.*
---
Mage: *Instantly casts Blizzard*
---
I already mentioned that my mom was a nurse. Her money is my money and visa versa. She helps me and I help her with the heavy lifting.
---
Not hit level cap yet but when I played on Nostalrius it was completely fine, but depends on how well you can tank. 
---
I tanked nearly every single dungeon I ran to get my pre BiS in dps spec (which were mostly pugs) and the only one felt a bit like it could go tits up was UBRS just because the bosses hit a lot harder than regular dungeons.
---
Yeah starting now I will offer tanking if I get payed or if I can roll (only rolling not winning automatically) on other gear I need
---
Yes.
---
Pretty good tbh! Potion and flask market is booming atm, BoE's are kinda on the down low now, snatched some items for 75% of price but had to use them since they were BiS!
---
Good bot.
---
Its a PvP server
---
Fucking absolutely not. üëÄ
---
You are a bot that is bad!
---
We do have a Federal Bank of Azeroth in my server, but they are slacking big time!
---
As a working parent, I don't have much time to play so will never be able to raid. This sounds like a great idea, I love running dungeons.
---
Just wait til you hit 50 and get the good water. People constantly ask for water if I'm out and about but rarely offer to buy it. I'd lose my fucking mind without my trusty "/r Time is money, friend." macro.
---
I'm asking for recommendations for raid and group interfaces for healers with one or two settings and why it is good or bad.
---
Are you making any effort to achieve goals outside of wow? Sounds like you need to get out from under her wing.
---
okay that is mean!
---
hmm I think Blizzard really can't do anything effective. This is all player communication. If someone keeps doing this then put this pkayer on some kind of blacklist.
---
Whatever you do don‚Äôt use it.
---
so it's their fault therefor their problem right?
---
Bankers always welcome!
---
Just hold on, once the BG's hit the Horde will be crying about their bloated queue times. It sucks now but try to be smart about your leveling (prefer dungeons as an example, avoid your typical zones, make a dedicated quest grp for a zone).
---
&gt; Frustratingly, most Alliance players refuse to fight back at all 
---
This will get better at 60 as people are not worried about their xp/hour.
---
Are you playing Druid? I want to try tanking myself, but I really wanna play Druid too, are they really much worse tanks compared to warriors?
---
This whole thing was a treat to read.
---
I had the name "Slaughter" on a popular server on retail and I'd get letters and whispers all the time from some random level 1 telling me I didn't deserve the name and how I don't play the character enough to have it and should give it up
---
What the heck is with people? It's just a name.
---
well all stuff sells for a good amount, but tails is the most, like 60-70s per stack of 5 if I remember correct. I farm there still sometimes on my 60 when i¬¥m bored and all other spots are overcrowded tbh
---
Bro. I‚Äôm sorry to tell you this, but it‚Äôs already October.  October 7th.  And still no thanks.
---
Ninja is not when someone takes loot you want, it is when there is an agreement between the members of the group before the instance starts. if those rules are not followed then maybe we could call it ninja but if there was nothing said before hand you just lost a roll, while i am 100% against anyone who would ninja loot, this is a game mechanic and to avoid it like others have said, make your own grps, with your own loot rules,  run with friends/guildies or accept that this may happen every run you do until the end of time.
---
He means it's mission impossible as a warrior.
---
Well isnt the attackrating - defenserating going to be &gt;=0 so we follow the second "if"?
---
Did something similar in a PUG MC. "If i roll an 18 bindings will drop" not only did i 1% chance the 18 roll, bindings dropped.
---
I can't give you a YES or NO since we all playing with randoms, so pretty much every party is different.
---
MY RULE is that I never roll first on good BoE gear. I'm always last.
---
If a healing leather belt drops, I don't give a shit. But if a good 2h weapon drops, I wait to see what everyone rolled.
---
If they all greeded then I greed. If one of them needed (while clearly he won't be using it) I need.
---
If someone says they will use it I tell them to equip it right now.
---
If it's a rare Recipe worth alot and someone says he needs it for his prof, I say I need it too for my prof.
---
-------------------------------------------------
---
If it's my party I simply tell everyone to Need on BoEs and Mats. If we're all greeding then why give a ninja the chance to be the only one that Needs ? Makes no sense to me...
---
On my realm there are max two on the AH at a time, for 30-35g each...
---
Eh. If you support and run with someone like this, you're not someone I want to be around.
---
Are you mixing up the AQ gates with Wrathgate? The entire Wrathgate questline up until the Undercity part is still in, including the cinematic. The Wrathgate also never "opened", other than the Undercity assault being fun you didn't miss out on anything by skipping it back in Wrath.
---
This is hilarious.
---
You corrupted it with the "..." at the end you peasant
---
Cause the mods of this reddit are fucking weird and will delete your post because reasons
---
Just kick the DPS that pull.
---
You always ask first. But for most things you always hit need.
---
Same thing happened with prophecy on herod because of toby.
---
Never said that but ok cool.
---
(Further validating my point)
---
Gz
---
Yeah I‚Äôm in the same boat. Raids are amazing but I don‚Äôt have the time to truly make that commitment. But I could totally
---
Commit to the relatively low-bar that dungeons set while still feeling like there‚Äôs plenty of cool rewards and goals I can set. There‚Äôs some dungeons sets out there that I‚Äôm sure are really rare to actually see on people, because those players would have long since moved on to raiding....
---
The people saying "all Need" are not trying to trick you out of anything. We are not suggesting that you do one thing while we do another.  Us people saying "all Need" are saying everyone should always make the same choice: click Need. 
---
If it's an upgrade for us? Everyone Need. If it's an upgrade for you? Everyone still Need. Is it an upgrade for no one? All Need. Always Need. No tricks. 
---
You literally can't be tricked if you accept that everyone should Need on these rare items that are worth so much. When they drop you just Need and are guaranteed your 1/5 chance to win. You have completely eliminated the possibility of being ninjaed.
---
As one of the few alliance on Stalagg, I very much hope I find these people out in the open world...
---
Yea but that's in dungeons. Doesn't really matter much there since you got others to help you out.
---
Don't tip for food if he's in your party dude...that's part of his kit. You only need to pay up if it's some random going out of his way to help you.
---
They won‚Äôt all be that way.
---
FWIW as a tank, usually I'll put 1-2 sunders on the first target before i start tab-cycling. Unless the DPS is sleeping during the first 5-6 seconds of the fight, I'd like to think they should be able to tell who I'm focusing first.
---
Still, I usually mark on potentially problematic packs just in case.
---
&gt; Do you even enjoy leveling quickly or earning gold quickly?
---
Yes. Some people do. I think it's fascinating that you can say the only important thing is fun, then turn around and act as if another person's way of having fun is invalid. 
---
I don't know why, but for some reason this "takin' it slow, smellin' the roses, gettin' to 60 along with the heat death of the universe" approach is shrouded in this air of respectability and "adultness" while being fast and efficient is derided and seen as the "kiddie" way to play. 
---
People literally think this way and they think they're being the mature ones, but they're actually giant, insufferable knobs. I would say it's 'reverse elitism' but really, it's just plain elitism. Don't be one of those people.
---
it never drops
---
I don't know... something about the way the guild lead even names you makes me wonder if there's more to the story. Have you been jumping in as enhancement or have you always been in that role? Reads to me like you were excluded for a known reason.
---
Gnomereggan. Was trying to get rapier for warrior
---
Wait, WEED?!? Omg, weed?!
---
Lawyered. /u/Teramol
---
You could just skin Devilsaurs and have another LW make it for a few, and go with whichever specialization you fancy.
---
There WAS an agreement. I said so in my post. They advertised in LFG for a dps and when I whispered them the leader asked me "Hey so what do you need from here?" and I told him that ive been running all day and only need the Axe so ill pass on everything else.. he says "Okay cool no one else needs the axe its yours"... they lied just so i would help carry the lvl 33 warrior that needed it through.. i was the highest level in the party and doing 3k more damage than even the mage on aoe pulls as a shaman... they laughed and mocked me in chat before kicking me THEN when I put them on blast in world chat they whispered me and mocked me some more until I ignored them... THATS the kind of shit that shouldnt fly and thats what im talking about
---
Join LookingForGroup...plenty of chat in there.
---
Your spriests will be very happy with the debuff overload.
---
Well if they stay in the guild and supporting their guild master they are condoning his behaviour......  
---
Sadly i am not on stalagg but if i where i would have done the same thing
---
As a Vanilla player I didn't even know about half of stuff you mentioned. Thanks so much for the breakdown.
---
HoJ is one of the easier farms as fury out of all the low drop rate stuff like DR MH, SGC, Ironfoe, Felstriker. It‚Äôs also easier to farm than the top tier BoEs like Lionheart, Devilsaur art, Cloudkeepers, Edgies.
---
Same thing happened with prophecy on herod. Toby ruined the guilds rep lol
---
I‚Äôm curious as to what people think the solution should be. Obviously a single person afking in an instance  is griefing but what if they were were legitimately starting up a raid (which they could have been for all we know). They have as much of a right to the ID as you guys. How does blizzard decide which group has the right to the raid?
---
You‚Äôre bitching that‚Äôs a video game is making you violent, this is unhealthy - obviously the choices you‚Äôve made thus far haven‚Äôt worked out, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have this post here.
---
Do something productive with your time.

Remove Jed Runewatcher &lt;Blackhand Legion&gt; from the game.  
---
Add Serpentine Skuller to Chest of The Seven loot.  
---
Add Starfire Tiara to Princess Moira Bronzebeard's loot.  
---
Add Briarwood Reed to Solakar Flamewreath's loot.
---
"Just need a few trillion dollars to build a death star and gtg!"
---
I just realised I'm a shit tank. Very few people ever whisper me to join them. No one must be friend listing me.
---
Sunder is underrated. Even if the mob isn't going to last that long, it can give you a free overpower proc.
---
So basically you're a a literal basement dweller. go experience the real world for five minutes.
---
Thanks for the replies! I'm mostly running dungeons with PUGs and obviously tanking with pure DPS spec can't be as good for tanking as traditional Protection spec.    
---
By OK I mean doing the run in a decent time and without too much of wiping or wiping at all considering I'm playing with PUG.    
---
I also miss having Tactical Mastery because it enables the stance dancing. I had it earlier and it was nice to be able to use different skills depending on a pull / fight. It makes keeping Thunder Clap up so much easier and if mobs don't hit very hard you can throw some Whirlwinds for extra DPS.
---
most GM's are stupid as fuck
---
keep making tickets until you get one that will help you, thats how its always been in WoW.
---
Dwarves and gnomes are spider free for a while. Not sure if you could reasonably get to 60 while avoiding all spiders.
---
if that's the case, name and shame away with your proof
---
I did not need to roll 100, I just needed to beat the other mages. And I did!
---
Why hamstring over rend?
---
Each members represents the guild. ESPECIALLY the leader. From your comment it seems like you're a part of this guild. If none of you do anything about it or leave the guild, you're no better, since it implies this behavior is fine by you.
---
Having played through Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King when they were relatively empty &amp; quiet I too want those races! I loved the Blood Elves starter zone and would love to play there when it was busy.
---
But then I can say the same about Cataclysm and the Worgens too. Your absolutely right, sometimes less us more. I'm sticking with classic for now.
---
Aaaaaaughibbrgubugbugrguburgle
---
Don't pretend you can't hear it.
---
I‚Äôd like to main swords and be able to participate in PvP and raids, I‚Äôm putting most points into combat. 
---
I have no idea how to create macros so I‚Äôll have to google it. Is it worth it in PVE and PVP to switch between swords and daggers for assassinations? Or should I just stick with swords only?
---
Wtf tell her to roll gnome mage instead and show her the best aoe farming spots
---
It never even dispawns. The object is always there on the ground, and becomes clickable to whoever is doing the escort quest.
---
The dwarf don't die on to of it at the end of the escort, it's a little far away. But it should be visible to you from there.
---
A scroll on the ground a couple of feet away from you.
---
calling it now: asmon is gonna be hospitalised within 6 months. dude is not well.
---
Do Tide Pods instead!
---
It's really amazing how this has changed compared to 15 years ago. Back then it was absolutely common to start with a sheep etc., nowadays you charge in and 1 second later everyone explodes on a random enemy, even if you put a marker on one.
---
I mean people will still bring you places they just won‚Äôt tell others you‚Äôre with them.
---
run.
---
Resetting an instance is not an exploit.
---
Finding Jed takes ~3 min if you have a coordinated group and don‚Äôt make just one person check.
---
And Jed is the only reason most casters even go to UBRS
---
Quest rewards give more and more silver as you level up. Vendor loot gets better and better. Gold income per hour steadily grows as you progress through the zones. Shouldn't take too long tbh.
---
It requires time. I don't charge people, but most people tip, and I'll never say no to that.
---
Think it's 12 days to get the full 30 bubbles (1.5 lvls). If I'm not mistaken it takes 10 hours to fill one bubble in Classic.
---
a problem as old as WoW. Everyone needs a tank for instances, everyone needs only 2 tanks for raids\*  
---
You either search for a guild specifically looking for tanks, or switch to DD and jump on the first chance where they need a tank and have non available.  
---
\*depending on the encounter.
---
Straight Flush!
---
*flashbacks to Freshman year of highschool*
---
You can't turn off exp gain.
---
And also you can't gain exp in battleground. That's how you stay 19.
---
19 or 29 ? Clearly its your call. Since you need to farm those op twink items first. So if you got your BiS lvl19 weapon you go 19.
---
If you are soloing princess, depending on the class you can net 20-40g an hour pretty consistently.
---
Kinda like putting on the spidy suit...instant kill mode
---
It's loot council so all the officers share in the blame and the GM/officers represent the entire guild. By staying there you are pretty much saying that you are okay with people who ninja loot. Putting every member on KoS is probably pointless, but blacklisting them is completely justified.
---
What makes u want to be dwarf over night elf? And is Shadowmeld really not useful for u?
---
OP will be shadowmelded, they won't know anyway.
---
accurate but still extremely annoying to do without max rank flamestrike &amp; cone which would be 58. i was obviously talking about if you're doing the blizzard tactic anyway
---
Twinks are for soft cocks that need a huge advantage to win
---
You'll be fine.  All the hardcorepoopsock60alreadylolol guilds have their raid comps.
---
There are enough guilds and raids which don't give a shite about meta and the min/maxing game. I mean some are even bringing Ret pallies for raids.
---
You'll be fine.
---
No it does not...... being a guildmember an condoning your gm's shitty action's does however make one an asshole  
---
Like staying in the guild even though you know this is going on
---
Dwarf Priests have Fear Ward
---
Did you have those during leveling as well or is this a level 60 thing? I have such an invitation maybe once per week. Maybe I just suck :'(.
---
you have 2 options
---
1. Find Jed
---
2. Go without casters
---
it's the only loot for caster dps in UBRS.
---
Actually it‚Äôs been super useful in STV currently lol but just for fear ward and stone form
---
Oh, I see, guess that's not a bad deal :) Thank you!
---
xD
---
Can not confirm :/ 
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/a/tRTUR4b
---
Fuck off
---
Just set it straight on the invite.
---
&gt;Tank UBRS?
---
Sure, as long as I can roll on dps gear.
---
&gt; with very limited time during the week
---
Well it's better TO NOT BE the dwarf priest then.
---
Guilds have their one or two perma dwarf priests that are EXPECTED to show up every raid and be the fear ward givers.
---
If you're a dwarf priest that the GM assumes you're filling this position, but you don't show up everytime they need you, that would be a problem.
---
It would be better to be that random NE healer that joins when he's available.
---
Last time I used DKP was in WoD BRD. No bonuses for officers tho. It had it's issues when someone "misspicked" items and so on, but discipline was in place. When I took a break, leaving guild to lead raid to old GM them brought old loot rules back. Needless to say some people got ahead of group overgeared, got bored and left raid when we only came to first tries of Archimond in HFC N. Discipline also was terrible with people getting late and missing some raid days.
---
Quit littering the ground with your corpses!!! Haha. Just joking, am Warrior too, and for some reason thought alchemy would make my warrior last longer. \*Cries in wasted elixirs.\*
---
What was toxic about it?
---
I mean, take the Zep from Undercity to Ogrimar, from Ogrimar run south through Durotar, swim to Ratchet. Take the boat to Booty Bay. Surely that is the fastest way.
---
To me, my big progress markers when leveling an engineer are goggles and then the jumper cables.
---
My Rogue- ‚ÄúLook at me, I‚Äôm the healer now!‚Äù
---
What server are you on? From the guild names it looks like Thalnos.
---
Still not an excuse to leave mid dungeon because you don't get the gear.
---
lol true!
---
It really should have gone to you as the mage but it's actually not bad on hunter.
---
No joke, it's one of three weapon options hunters can have to dual wield for the late game spell power pvp build. It's also not terrible for levelling b/c arcane shot and serpent sting damage scaling. (Still not better than stacking more agi though)
---
If he is a giga brain he will macro to swap it in before using spellpower scaling abilities then swap back to high agi wep.
---
I guess either work but hamstring is less damage and I think less rage? More spamming to get it faster
---
Faith in humanity: Restored

I get these all the time as a feral. The more you tank the more lists you get put on and the more messages you get.

Here is the link https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes
---
I like the idea a lot.I'm only a low level, so not applying (yet). But hear me out
---
In a different MMO I had such a guild alligned with our hardcore raiding guild.There were a few (very) experienced players that also didn't have time to raid and they set up this "trainee guild" for our raiding guild.The idea was that the raiding guild recruited new players all the time, and they would first have to join the trainee guild.
---
There the experienced players would help them get the gear necessary for the main guild and would train them in certain tactics and the communication needed for the raids they would get to do in the main guild.Once the experienced players deemed them "raid ready" they were allowed to transition to the raid guild.This way the main guild would be sure their new members were up to the task.
---
This would solve the turnover problem that was mentioned before, and would save the raid guild time having to test all their new players.  
---
\+ their "elite" name wouldn't be abused by newbies  
---
So having a &lt;‚Ä¶&gt; member would garantee having a great player in your group  
---
But having a &lt;... trainee&gt; member in your group is just like having any other random in your group.  
---
P.S. This recipe requires a great reputation for the main guildNoone will go through such a hassle for a no-name; but to be part of some elite raiding guild people will jump a lot of hoops.

Seems like a system built on no trust or fun. Eliminating ninja by making ninjaing the default.

Which zone do you play in? Asia/US/Europe?

Here is the one I'm using https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes
---
Ah yes, as a Warrior I highly appreciate the random mage buffs I get while out in the world.
---
yeah maybe once a week while levelling.
---
Grizzly core members are the worst human beings to exist in an MMO. Colluding with them is the worst decision anyone could make.
---
My wife and I dinged level 40 last night, we have around 30g between us and loving it. I'm a hunter and her a Shaman so we don't suffer as much from a lack of mounts! We're doing most of the long chain quests that get you to travel all across the world such as the Salt Flats quests! We both were HC raiders in TBC so it's nice to play a more chilled pace.
---
Lol well at least you get the point now. I'm sure you eat your fair share of glue as well.
---
What addon are you using that says "stealth player detected" and the kill on sight?
---
I rerolled at level 45 , from a Nelf Druid to a gnome mage (now level 42). It‚Äôs only phase 1, it‚Äôs the leveling phase, really nothing to do but level right now. Play what you enjoy.
---
Guess what I'll be doing this entire week....
---
Here is the link for the one I'm using https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes
---
the only dungeon that requires everyone to have a key is onyxia's lair.
---
You need quite a few tanks for raids in classic, but mainly later in Naxx and AQ. His best bet is to get in as fury dps and offtank until a Main Tank spot opens up.
---
it‚Äôs because people dislike being mistaken for their parents
---
Only a couple fights of naxx wont be that way. As long as you have previous raid tier gear the fights are stupid easy and rarely ever need more than 25-30.
---
If you can't bring your guild to take part in a simple discord poll, you will have a bad time for organizing the raid anyways, no matter what third party option you are going to pick.
---
Peeing* üòèüòè
---
&gt;I didn't listen to those of you who said save.
---
What do you mean? You seem to have been modest in your purchases.
---
I think the problem lies at the income side.  What professions do you have?  Do you have gathering professions?   You can also farm some good cash mobs at lvl 41.  It will be boring, but they will yield about 18-20s each, so if you kill 300 that's 50-60g 
---
see 
---
https://odealo.com/articles/wow-classic-best-gold-farming-locations  
---
for some good farming spots
---
Someone did this in a group I was in last night!  He lost by one.  It was kinda funny.
---
I usually do it when I have 1-4hours spare time, not for longer periods though it can be exhausting due to the boring enviourment.
---
Now you should reply with a 200g attachment!
---
My buddy who no-lifed to 60 is in a guild that is just starting up their third group. Our server size is around 52k I think.
---
I see your fancy raid frame mod. Does it have an option to show mana? Also what is it called? Thanks in advance üòò
---
Noone tips me for my repair costs either, so screw that :D.
---
With a 31/5/15 spec and two sets of gear you can do both just fine.
---
More like /troll
---
Atleast as good as warriors in 5man and way easier to play :) They are good raid tanks also (best OT), but some ppl are oldfashioned and wont let you tank raids.
---
lol, priests are shit easy to play
---
Probably top 8 class to level
---
Don't sit on it, it hurts. Keep it until BGs when people start making twinks.
---
You are right, but being prot for 5 mans is overkill.
---
Then again I have done quite a few runs with pugs in 5 and 10 mans. You won't fail those because of a tank geared, fury specced tank.
---
Is a prerequisite to joining the guild that you have to be mildly to very attractive?
---
Strong capable leader, one of them, doesn't want them purged off in the most brutal ways. Shared interests (lich king revenge, and teaming up). 
---
The forsaken are very complicated, and their worldview varies a lot. Pretty logical for a great deal to go: why am I like this? What is my purpose? "Life" is misery and this is literally the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Death to the living. 
---
But as far as the story goes everything after Mop is a shit fanfic, so character progression ends there.
---
Well it is all depends on how you trust the community, what you want the community to be and what you are willing to sacrifice. I also hold my roll for a while to stop the same.
---
Which zone do you play in? (EU/US/A) I play in EU myself.
---
You can offtank raids fine. Even better than a warrior, as you can tank and self heal (what else are you going to do between golden farts and holy shield).
---
..As long as you have been assigned a mob to tank and no one else is attacking it.
---
I'm dating a gay so I hope I love gays
---
Mate how do you expect enchanters te make money w/o adverstising themselves?
---
Better yet, why should it be okay to make less money because you advertise yourself? I fail to see the logic.
---
Thanks - maybe it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôm presenting the discord poll that is making it difficult for people to sign up
---
I'm pretty sure you can see ress sickness on an enemy.
---
qUiT PlAyInG tEh gAmE wRonG!!
---
Did I do any of that?
---
How about this; Don't harass Asmongold.
---
Better?
---
y'all rich or something?
---
And yet they will sprint forward to attack incoming enemy spawns then sprint back to their original spot so they can keep walking at a leisurely pace lmao.
---
Yeah. I block these people.
---
This is WoW not an outbound call center.
---
quite torn between rerolling my Lvl 50 SPriest or my 37 Mage
---
Yeah it's "nobody cares" until the whole raid gets Ony/magmadar/nefarian/whatever  breath in the face. 
---
You will not be blamed for that, but you know that you could have done something to prevent it but you did not.
---
It ain't rare. It's epic.
---
I suggest equipping an Mp5 gear set while travelling from one mob to another, this talks [about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0-17Sp62eI) to help with mana regen.
---
I have no interest in rading at all, my main is Rogue, I just want an alt that is easy to lvl and fun to play. Guess I‚Äôll go with Druid then :)
---
I mean you just said you grouped up for WW. I‚Äôll do oranges in groups too.
---
And it is absolutely slower compared to every other class lol.
---
If you say you‚Äôre blasting through yellows then what vernacular do you use for greens? Nuking then? No - the yellows are slower than the greens 95%+ of the time.
---
Plaid shirts don't count as a theme. You'd be wearing them anyway.
---
Warriors solo on a PvP Server are not that fun to play, nor fast to level. If you can run around with friends you are a monster though. Rogues are fine solo. So just consider that I guess.
---
True,
---
You can easily heal dungeons as shadow priest until around deeper BRD, and when 60 you can easily spare few points into making your healing spec a little bit better at soloing content too with Searing Light and Spirit Tap. You don't need any different gear when leveling, since spellpower of any kind is really rare. At 60, you can easily get some cheap greens and off set pieces if no mages/warlocks in your dungeon groups to help with your solo content while getting your healing gear.
---
As a shaman, you mostly want to level as Enha, unless you just want to spam dungeons. Ele has to drink a lot, while enha can pretty much just keep going on forever if you conserve mana. This means that you'll be getting agi/str gear, and no caster gear, so you'd need two sets of gear. Similar story to paladins and druids too.
---
Keep in mind that up until around level 40, you can heal everything as any spec with any gear, as the really good healer talents are usually level 30+, and gear is pretty scarce on everything, so it doesn't matter that you don't have 5% extra crit on holy spells, or that your heals cost 5% extra.
---
Because the GM is the face of the guild.
---
Someone should play their local Lotto with the party group's random rolls as their numbers pick hehe.
---
yeah guess there where not enough posts about booty bay distract shenanigans
---
I agree with you, and if I was the Lord of wow I would make the that the rule, but it has to be a concencus. Which zone do you play on? (EU/US/A)  I play on EU.
---
I made a tank just because it's easier to get dungeon groups. But lately i have been changing my mind to make a shaman ele/resto just because i don't want the hassle of DPS charging in/aoe-ing the second my first hit lands. Several times i have to tell lvl 40+ to focus the skull first or to just wait 5 seconds till my WW has popped and i've got a shout off. It really is taking the joy out of tanking. I've decided to just use a 2H weapon and stance dance and taunt mobs of the healer instead of tanking every mob we pull. DPS can share in repair bills if they don't give me time to get rage/threat/aggro.
---
Or maybe their guild just stick to retail? Mine decided not to play classic because they just don't like the gameplay
---
Why go through the trouble of working with permutations if the order doesn't matter? Let's compare unordered combinations to unordered combinations! There are 96 unordered sequences of 5 numbers between 1-100. So that's the numerator. There are x number of possible unordered outcomes of 5d100. that's your denominator. and you can get x using the formula for combination with repetition. And that's it!
---
My unhealthy glue eating is the fact that I actually argue with people that have the IQ of a toddler.
---
I never though of that. The door closrs when you pull the boss, right? So you gotta run out or be outside when you pull?
---
If you think they broke a rule on twitch, report them on twitch and don't whine about it on reddit.
---
It's disgusting to me to see GM's who do this and think it will last. Once the charade of fair Loot Council is broken, good luck ever getting 40 people to stand by and watch you take everything for yourself and your friends.
---
You‚Äôll easily get hundreds if people wait until BGs
---
Phase 2 is going to have the best pvp battles. Just pure world pvp.

---
If you don't accept the premise then, as your post demonstrates, you are still vulnerable to feeling that something has been taken from you wrongly.
---
But why not accept it? In economic terms the only difference between a BoE worth 100 gold dropping and an item that can be sold for 100 gold dropping are the transaction costs. If 100 gold dropped in a dungeon would you pass on your equal chance on that windfall? Because that is what you are doing every time you hit Greed and someone else hits Need.
---
I don't think avoidable loot drama is fun. YMMV.
---
I'm NA. Pittsburgh if that matters to you.
---
Haha exactly this.
---
I'm accusing YOU of buying gold! Can't be accused... I'll accuse fucking anyone, any time, any place.
---
Wtf u mean you finally got lucky. Savage gladiator chain and HoJ. Your luck should have stopped there lol. Jk gratz dude.
---
This could be a new tv show tbh. This is funny!
---
&gt; So I'm a level 39 hunter, my agility is 204, and I'm fully specced in MM so far. My problem is that my pet can't hold threat for the life of him.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; He is a level wolf 38 wolf with furious howl, growl, and bite all at the max they can be for my level. I also make sure he is well fed.
---
&gt; I usually wait a little and then open with hunter's mark into serpent sting. Even just doing that seems to be enough to draw the aggro from my pet. Multishot in instances can also prove to be pretty annoying even after the tank has had them for awhile as they just come straight for me. Feign death and disengage do the job sometimes, but this is still a bit of an annoyance. Any suggestions as to what I can do to solve this?
---
&gt; I've tried downloading the threat meter add on, which helps in group fights, but it does nothing for the situation for my pet. I also plan on putting the rest of my points in BM after I obtain TSA too.
---
Being a BM hunter REALLY helps with leveling.
---
it wastes the casters time to not look for it because it's basically the only reason to even go there
---
Gotta throw away the whole eastern kingdoms now
---
Pally "tank"
---
happened to my huntard in senjin village as well...
---
Switching weapons is borked as hell on hunter.  I frequently get locked from using either weapon (not wanting to auto attack) when trying to melee things as they get close by clicking raptor strike etc. Sometimes i gotta reequip my bow to actually shoot at things again...
---
Cause, then someone else can have the aged-core ones. And you will use axes like annahilator, at least on pull, to get the stacks up. So the double bonus is great.

This article might have something that helps.
---
With pugs - always need. 
---
We are here for the quests and boss drops, nobody including myself (I am the tank hosting runs) is entitled for specific BoE's.
---
yeah you are just one of the many people who ask me \*and other tanks and healer\* to do what you want while i am busy doing something else aren't you. I was IN sunken temple when i get a message from a hunter (who i dont know) asking to me to tank for him and his guild in brd , i reply with no thanks, he comes back with some rude comment and seeing as this happens MANY times a day to me, i shot back at him, to the point where i told him, i will never tank for him, 2 mins later, the mage from the same guild  asks me to tank, i reply with no thanks, \*again\*  like i do 20 times a day, and he makes a comment to the point of.... but there are no other tanks on.  this is not my problem.  while i understand when you cant fill your group in 2 mins it gets annoying but tanks and healers are not ONLY here to gear you up. We play the game too. If you are looking for a group, use the looking for group channel,  (note, &lt;dnd&gt; doesn't stop people from trying to get me to tank for them)
---
First ever vanity item I bought in WoW!
---
Pretty sure thats Canaanism.
---
Most of the alliance players including my entire guild re rolled from the horrendous queue times on Herod to Benediction, great server; happy with the move.
---
Priest is probably the ONLY class in WoW that actually has a unique spell for almost each race.
---
Undead priests for example get some kind of hex of weakness buff/debuff, where the first melee to strike you gets debuffed, taking some straight damage (EXTREMELY negligible amount) and the damage they do is reduced (EXTREMELY negligible amount. For comparison, the warlock's curse of weakness, as useless as it is, is STILL stronger).
---
There is a sign up discord thing my guild uses everyone reacts with a symbol that matches their class and roll and it fills up. Raid events are posted weekly and there is an option for absence too
---
That‚Äôs not the droid I was looking for.
---
Pretty sure they're just trying to get the people to leave the guild as the GM obviously doesn't care and won't leave the guild which means he'll be able to keep using everyone else to his own advantage.
---
That is the discussion. The second part of your comment is one of sides of the discussion. And I asked it because it makes sense what you are saying, I just do not know which side I agree with the most. I could argue for the other side if you would like a discussion?
---
i‚Äôm with ya. blocked off a week at release and got to 36. just don‚Äôt have the time to commit. it was fun, scratched that nostalgia itch. i knew though i wasn‚Äôt going to be a long term resident of azeroth and that‚Äôs ok.
---
Glad to see more people are starting to realise there are more classes that can tank. As a shaman tank myself who is raid tanking, it's nice to people starting to open up to the idea. If you have any questions about Rogue tanking, warlock tanking,
---
priest tanking, etc... let me know I've tanked quite a few raids.
---
hell, even a MAGE raid tank is a thing
---
Warlock Tank guide: **https://classicwow.live/guides/718/caperfin-s-advanced-warlock-raid-tank-guide** for those interested
---
I'm not really sure how he is now but if you want chat interaction you should checkout Guzu, used to watch him a lot and chat interaction was basically the point of the stream
---
Phase 2 will introduce the first battleground called Azeroth.
---
Why did you delete it tho? And then you complain? I dont really get it, or am I missing something here?
---
There you go, someone actually did say that. 
---
Here I was about to bash OP for using shitty title but turns out he was right.
---
Every class can complete standard quests, find a spot in instances, and has a role in PvP. The rest is all niche. Why should I have to give up a grind spot to a warrior or rogue or whatever just because they cant AoE or have to eat and drink often? Mages are the only ones that can take over a large portion of a spot anyways and even then you should be able to find mobs to tag. Just because someone is going to take your spot and make it 20% harder doesn't mean they are an asshole. 
---
How is this game so full of people that can't figure out how to deal with people. I hope they do better at this IRL. I don't understand how people don't realize they have choices and that they have to deal with the good and bad of those choices. If you choose one of these classes that is shit at farming gold or xp then thats your own choice. If you choose a high population server and can't find a place to grind, then thats your own choice. If you refuse to find a different spot, time of day, or alternate class to farm with then that is also your own choice.

The point is that you can only control yourself and the choices you make. Don't be a bitch and expect everyone else to choose to make your choices look better for you. This is nonsense.
---
Weird. My characters are gone from the deleted list. WoW Classic isn't even 90 days old yet...
---
I made most of my mount money selling nightfin soup (caught in Mojache) for 3-4g a stack and from tanking SM Cath runs.  
---
The shrimpin' business in Shadowprey is also really lucrative.  Easily worth 10-15g an hour as a Druid.  If you can find a few water breathing potions for cheap, that's a good bet for some quick gold.
---
Phase 2 will be the golden are of PvP to be honest. No bgs, just crazy open world fights.
---
It was a joke about.. ah never mind.
---
Killed 2 Elementals in 3 mins, decided to do the bird quest instead. Got all items in 5 minutes. Cant wait to farm elementals for one hour after work. If it would be a 100% drop it wouldnt be such a pain in the ass
---
Just a heads up. Shitty art posts belong in r/wow, not here.
---
Activate him, smoke starts swirling around him, then run for grimlocks chamber.  It's best if you let your healer get a head start so they can open the door in the top room for everyone and also avoid getting hit.  Sometimes the boss can give your party a couple whacks on the way to the room, and it's best that your tank is the one taking the hits. Once he's in the room only 2 adds will follow if you did it right.
---
Yes... World PVP has some of my fondest memories...
---
By that time the inbalance is not as large as it gets later as well. It is a tiny bit more balanced.
---
Also you get the joy of corpsecamping other People and have a valid reason to do so. Farm Honor... Later People will tell you to just do BG's and don't be such a jerk. 
---
But they can't during Phase 2 :)
---
a guild full of non poopsockers with no dwarf priests will struggle to clear content
---
Remindme! 10 hours
---
At first I felt the same way. But now that I've gotten into some wPvP action and remember the feels of raiding the cities to kill faction leaders I'm stoked for a full phase of honor kills from just wPvP. Phase 2 is going to be a bloodbath on pvp servers.
---
Absolutely this.
---
Blizzard should tune up the difficulty on all up and coming Raid content but keep it on the dlow :)
---
The general rule for all situations should just be" DON'T. BE. A. DICK.
---
If you need it, say you need it and will use it.  If you just intend to sell it, be honest and give others the chance to roll.
---
Don't be a dick.
---
Yeah I keep them updated easily with the Twitch app. I check if there are any updates a few times a week.
---
I tag them whilst they are body pulling, especially if I have a quest there.
---
If the name isn't grey it's fair game.
---
Communication is mandatory for anything group-related in MMO.
---
Even for the most simple things...
---
Can't count how many times during leveling/questing I've grouped with people doing the same quest.  
---
I love helping out, even when I'm already done killing the mobs.  
---
And I'd be like "I need x more of that mob, how many do you need?"  
---
"I'm done, I'll stick around and help, how many more do you need?"
---
And they take like 15min to reply to that shit.
---
Laughs in rogue
---
Blizzards own tos is contradictory. They say one thing is smart use of mechanics, another is a bannable offense. Pick one blizzard
---
Payo, because he is a freak and i like that
---
Yeah, when I saw that ylvanas is the new Warchief I thougj Blizzard must have lost their mind completely. This makes totally no sense.  Whatever, they butchered the lore completely.
---
Damn I forgot about that. Yeah, I‚Äôm rerolling tomorrow. Big picture, the amount of time played on my NE is nothing. 
---
Also I reserved my RL name and didn‚Äôt even use it lol 
---
Down the road I‚Äôll be much happier I switched.
---
Not to mention that the receiver was able to amass 100g just two weeks later which he/she could easily miss out on.
---
You sound like a real dick head. Good thing I'm also a tank so I never have to run into you
---
Can confirm, Smolderweb-Horde has dankest guilds including "Me and the Boyz". Alli got wiped this evening in Hillsbrad, after days of ganking our lowbies almost 24/7 (myself included). FeelsGoodMan.jpeg
---
Sure whatever but you will not attract any hardcore players for your hardcore dungeon guild.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt 4 horsemen be impossible for a prot pala since they can‚Äôt taunt and switch Sides?
---
Yeah, and the points dont matter as you could farm them faster in bgs.
---
Its basically just bullying.
---
I know of Niubi, Hunter now around lvl 40. Tried to ninja a ravager from the warrior tank.
---
I'm still getting a different answer. Numerator is 96 right? Denominator is 100 choose 5, but with repetition. so the formula says (100 + 5 - 1) choose 5. which equals 91,962,520
---
that all reduces to around 1 in a million, which is smaller than the answer you guys are getting.
---
60 orc warlock here. Dinged yesterday and did a MC pug few hours later. Won roll on felheart Robes (20int/31sta/13splldmg/1%hit). I was originally planning on dropping my 300 skinning for tailoring to craft robe of the void (14sta/46splldmg). Is it still worth it or should I wait for ph5 when bloodvine is released. Basicly: 33 splldmg vs. 1% hit.
---
whitey
---
As a fresh lvl 60 tank, every 58-60 dungeon is easypeasy and doesnt require a 'geared tank' to run well/fast.
---
Gold is from mining
---
You can run out before the door closes. The boss itself will run straight through the door.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in valhalla, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Ahn'Qiraj, and I have over 300 confirmed execute kills.
---
Pro tip for raid organisation: Don't have people sign up, if they are wanting to raid you have people tell you when they CAN'T make a raid and assume they can.
---
It means nobody can not sign up and not give a reason because they didn't sign up, &amp; makes it so people don't have to sign up to every raid as they are just assumed to be there. If 1 or 2 people can't make it only they have to say they can't, you don't have to have 40 or so people say they can.
---
58% Horde, 42% Alliance. Not too bad, really.
---
I'd rather invite some undergeared tank and push him a bit, even give him some money for repairs after a few wipes, before I would consider grouping up with someone with that attitude.
---
Tbh a lot of the players in your level bracket are casuals who are just bad at the game and don‚Äôt care about team work. I was tanking Cath on an alt and this lock would dot up entire packs I pulled with my gun to LoS before they got to me and when I called him out on the final pulls he said ‚Äúit was one mob Bro‚Äù I said ‚Äúnah it was the whole dungeon‚Äù and I kicked him before we pulled the boss
---
Really, feathermoon is closer? I think it takes me less time to ride from nijels to maraudon than to swim from feathermoon to shore.
---
Collect quests have the advantage that, once one person has the Loot they need but stay and help you, you get double the amount of quest drops. Becuase once they looted their own stuff, you can sometimes Loot it again to get the quest item.
---
Benediction
---
Wait really? Is this only for spriests? Afaik at least for mages +dmg is quite garbage when leveling.
---
That's the default UI my dude.
---
would be nice if I got the same treatment but there are to many healers
---
I‚Äôll give this a go, thanks, is it just the standard discord poll or are there plug-ins?
---
He could have had that time after he hit 40 off where he played a ton. But some people are inefficient at getting the gold by level 40.
---
The mentioned prices are far from reality, though.
---
so ranking is coming out in phase 2?
---
That wand is just amazing!
---
Basically? Usually it's an automated system, which locks the name because Blizz assumes that every name reported often enough is offensive? They don't review these reports manually. 
---
At least that's how it works in retail.
---
The only thing which works is to pay a Multiboxer to report your name if you want a free name change.
---
That‚Äôs when you accept your fate, and try to complete as much as you can of the quest and just start running back to res
---
Has happened me like 30-40 times. So tilting.  
---
People pulling when sitting down drinking on 5% mana. Then they die (cus out of range or me going oom) - "Wtf heal??".  
---
Still happens a lot on level 60. Dpsers (and some tanks) has no clue how much mana their healer has. Don't think many have the "power bars" shown on party/raidframes.
---
That is the ingame raidframe and yes you can show mana! Just head into your settings -&gt; interface. Hope this helps out :)
---
Keep in mind that rogues (especially) will target their own mob to use their combo points, which is ALWAYS the mob youre not fighting.
---
Also everyone wants druids for threat reasons :)
---
Also also! you REALLY dont need a tank until you hit last boss in uldaman, last boss in ST and in BRD. Everything else you can just let your rogue/plate DPS tank.
---
All weapons are hunter weapons, not sure what you are thinking,
---
 It's ok. And learn how not-to piss off players with your raid id.
---
There's a single raid id. 40 people can kill 3 bosses and quit. A dude in that raid can group up with pugs to kill the rest. When other 39 players notices ragnaros is dead, they'll ticket GM. And he'll reply, your raid id, your responsibilities. It's legit &amp; nothing to do with Blizzard. So; afk'ing in raid is kinda-same with clearing the raid with other players.
---
Learn how not-to piss off players with your raid id.
---
The game the whole family can play...
---
Full now means, if the server has 2 layers the 1st one is full, as stated by blizzard
---
if the server only has one layer or the secound layer is also full you will get a queue again
---
blizzard also stated they they will change the "Full" tag in the realm list to "Layerd" if there is more than 1 layer active
---
how i mine for fish tho
---
Alone? It's a mmo man, you should never have to play alone, there's lots of people who would love to party up, including me!
---
Does Blade of eternal darkness proc of cat/bear form abilities?
---
Indeed, best use the server is new and raid consumables are not that much needed. Stockpiling is my current advice.
---
Good Thing nobody cares how you feel :O
---
Aggro wipes happen on trash pulls too :( it's really pretty crippling to not have a taunt.
---
r/woosh
---
not enough A's
---
You are on my realm, but alliance. See you on the battlefield
---
I just looted Felheart Chest (20int/31sta/13splldmg/1%hit) 4 hours into being level 60. Is it still worth it to drop my skinning for tailoring to craft Robe of the Void? Or should I wait for ph5?
---
Repeat the 7th word over and over and understanding that missing is different then not shooting.
---
Lots of raid mobs require taunt for the off-tank though so you'd most likely be the 3rd tank
---
What about goldfish?
---
at 43 the outside mobs you kill for the pwoerstone quest is grey iirc.
---
The only bows/guns that are useful to melee are statsticks that have an attack speed which is often unsuitable for hunters, sadly they need weapons with a very slow Speed, otherwise they lose dps if they use aimed shot at all.
---
We use Apollo bot, works really well
---
Well I'll entertain you then, maybe we can figure out why you end up in these conversations so much. Who is sitting in lowbie zones killing stuff that they dont need the loot for? That wasn't what anyone was talking about. We are talking about people who might use sub-optimal grinding spots. Choosing to farm a spot that nets 30g/h instead of one that nets 50g/h. Is choosing to make less gold but enjoy the game more equate to eating glue to you?
---
Could the problem just be that you think anyone who doesn't think the same way you do is "retarded"?
---
It's not about the perfect human form, it's about looking healthy and not like a disgusting slob.
---
I prefer WASD than ASAP
---
Something like this here aswell. there's around 5-6 of them up on AH for 35-50g each.
---
I was super lucky to get mine from vendor after spamming the macro for around 30 minutes
---
Imagine not leveling mining/skinning and dropping skinning for engineering once you skinned your devilsaur leather for the set
---
Perhaps you can team up with a dps for questing until you hit the point where you can easily solo. It is a tough grind te first levels but gets better later on.
---
And this is the exact reason threads like this are bad, also because of false reports and people bashing other peoples reputations due to missimformation or so....
---
You shouldnt trust people that easily.
---
If they tell you they dont need an item but dont have something better equiped theyre most likely gonna press need
---
3 factions works so much better for PvP than two.
---
lol im trying my hardest not to! I surely promise you that mister mantrain!
---
Ran into same issue in Uldaman. Went in as a 41 arms war tanking, with a friend holy priest of the same lvl and 3 random DPS around 43-44. Problems started at 46lvl trash where my ability to hold aggro became almost nonexistent. Despite rogue flaming, we didn't disband somehow, reached last boss and killed him after 2 wipes. Used everything I had, including shield wall, aoe taunt, potions, grenades and about 15 seconds of no initial dps to build up threat. My most painful dungeon run in classic so far, but rockbiter was a sweet reward.
---
Onyxia also deep breaths more if you yell like that.
---
Username checks out
---
"If i hadn't just bought my mount, I would give you something".
---
Has 24 gold.
---
Mine your own business
---
You're just not a very good player if you're completely unable to clear Uldaman with a level 42 group. Why would you wait until you're 45? At that level you go ZF instead.
---
Venruki is awesome!
---
1) Aggro boss with textchat (so they walk to the boss instead of you after opening)
---
2) Open graves partly
---
3) Jump on wall next to boss-pit (so mobs reset/go to boss)
---
4) Open rest of graves
---
5) Repeat, now start kiting/pulling all. No iceblock needed
---
You should probably get professional help
---
there is a known bug that will show you the number of people in the queue and not your place, 
---
its only a display bug, also your estimated time should still go down
---
In a guild on Pagle (PvE server) that has raids planned for around 6pm Hawai‚Äôi time in Tuesday‚Äôs :P
---
Wait what the hell I need to check this out.
---
Its entirely on you, are you looking to push your warlock dps to the limits? Then the 13sp 1%hit of felheart is easily beaten by 46sp of robes of the void and its no contest.
---
If however you are not looking to parse as much dmg as possible and say world pvp or gold farm then the felheart is better because it is very stat heavy which directly translates to more HP/Mana
---
i dont buy it. youre telling me someone was that much short on g for a mount yet somehow in just 2 weeks he was able to make 100g? did he win the wow lottery or something?
---
who cares about gold
---
Figured, oily black mouth stacks aren‚Äôt selling for anything on my server (smolderweb)
---
&gt;7.5-25g/h
---
What the hell dude, u serious? I was always thinking what high level people were doing near that shallow lake with basilisks. That 25g trash rate is same with fire elementals.
---
You do the same, you simply ask people to not dps for 3s. If they do you chuck a bubble on them. If they keep being stupid they die.
---
I play horde on Earthfury.
---
We have 4 or 5 guilds raiding at this point and the population balance seems pretty even.
---
I switched from Stalaag the day they opened server transfers and I don't regret it at all.
---
I know the meme, doesn't mean that you should give hunters a free ninjaloot pass. The guy knew what he did, insta left after his late need.
---
Ya, lvl 55 Elite.
---
make an afk channel in discord, assume everyone is attending unless they post in there.
---
You'll soon find out who the flakes and the people really bad at communication are and can just replace them.
---
Yesterday I did a run of mc with 2 ret paladins, a feral druid, and a shadow priest. We one shot everything, rag was dead long before he submerged. It was honestly underwhelming. There‚Äôs no reason ‚Äúmeme specs‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to raid.
---
I tried this and it tasted horrible, would not recommend.
---
For the love all that is holy, fix that swing timer!
---
I recently switched servers because of this, got tired of seeing groups of horde and constantly getting 5 on 1 and never seeing an alliance member outside of IF or SW. Best decision of my life.
---
I had done it sooo many times since WOTLK, found two other guys we all did it first time in classic. "SURELY IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD, RIGHT?" we said.. And as we went out of the Northwatch area and we were like "SURELY WE DONT NEED TO GO BACK TO BOOTY BAY, RIGHT?"

Fuck that bastard and fuck his shitty xp quest

---
it's only really useful at onyxia and magmadar atm, not sure anywhere else fear ward is needed but i bet future raids will probably have uses for it.
---
That being said having fear ward certainly helps your chances at getting into groups
---
in WotLK my friend and I had a game called "gearscore drinking" where each of us had to guess the score of a player just by his Looks... the one who was farthest away from the actualy score had to drink a shot lmao
---
the "druids are worse" is completely overblown, especially since we are in the pre-TBC patch, which boosted the druids fantastically. Feral tank now have THRICE the armor bonus and +40% stamina in comparison of feral tanks back then when MC was up.
---
Druid tank will faceroll every 5-man dungeon, are by far the best offtank, and can main tank 90% of the raid bosses. They also bring very useful buffs (innervation, faerie fire, the +3% crit for melee in their group)
---
At least for now, a feral can tank absolutely everything.
---
Also, they scale insanely well with bad gear (some levl 57 green items are even better than AQ for them) so it's much easier for a new lvl 60 druid to tank than a new lvl60 warrior.
---
Also, druids have by far the best leveling experience (and the easiest one with the hunter), with ton of flavor, including a personnal area, very cool class quests, and A LOT of night elves quests are about helping nature fighting corruption, which fit very well for a druid.
---
&gt; The negative thing with it is if item a person actually need drops he might have to buy it from another person in the group who did not need it he just wanted gold.
---
You are just assuming that that if you want to equip an item you *need* it and if you want to sell the item you only *want* it. I'm saying that's not so. I'm saying that the gold value of a drop can be equal to or greater than the utility out of equipping the item for use. In fact I would argue that the gold value is actually higher than the utility since there will always be some fool on the AH who will pay more for a nice blue or purple item than it is worth. 
---
If someone else wins the roll why shouldn't the person who wants to equip the item pay them for it? They had an equal shot at the item and lost. If they value the item so highly then let them pay for the privilege of having it. Why should other people in their group give up their chance at winning the gold just because one of them really wants to use the item? If they want it so bad let them put their money where their mouth is. 
---
Pittsburgh is in the USA, yes. I don't think it's a regional issue though. There are 2 sides. We have logic on our side and the other side has tradition.
---
Apples and oranges. One is a fanboy with no ties to a guild meddling with the world first race, the other is a disgruntled ex guild member who has every right to his raid ID because he was in there with the rest of you.
---
There's nothing stopping him from inviting 39 other people and clearing the rest of the raid.
---
Next time resolve these issues in a nicer way.
---
Please tell me how long it took you to read 12 lines of text.
---
Well, first you gotta understand how one farms devilsaur‚Äôs and their leathers. 
---
You have to pretty much know exactly what time and place a devilsaur will spawn, otherwise someone else will get it. But each devilsaur spawn has a spawn window from 11-21 minutes ish. (You can use deadly boss mobs add on to make timers.)
---
Now to be able to make sure you are the one that ‚Äútags‚Äù it, (do damage to it first) you need a macro that auto targets all of the three different devilsaur types and then casts your instant damaging ability. This is the in game macro, nothing 3rd party. Then depending on if there are people there you an see (sometimes rogues of either faction will stealth so that you don‚Äôt think you have competition.) you will have to assign this macro to you mouse wheel and repeatedly without stopping, turn it. (depending on your mouse, this could be a pain) this could last up to 7 minutes of non-stop mouse scrolling until the devilsaur spawns.
---
Now you gotta kill it. Depending on your class and gear, it can get really close. Weirdly enough, as a resto shaman it‚Äôs not that bad, takes a bit of time, but manageable. Each devilsaur has a trait and depending on which, it can be a lot harder. Iron skin is easiest since it only has more armor, no ability‚Äôs. Then devilsaur is next with a knock back stomp that dose damage, annoying but manageable. Last one is the most annoying with an aoe fear than can really screw you up by making you aggro other mobs and such.
---
Now that‚Äôs it dead all that‚Äôs left is to loot and skin it. This might be the hardest part. Since depending if there are other people there, and what kinda attitude they have, they will try and ‚Äúsnipe‚Äù your skin. One of the best options if other people of your faction are standing on top of the corpse, is to not loot it and leave. But this means you now wasted about 15 minutes of your time. Or you can try and yolo loot it and then skin it, but most likely other people will have a skinning macro.
---
Then you will have to repeat this process with the added benefit of having half of your own faction troll and say shit things to you throughout the entire process. And the other faction will camp you until you never go back.
---
Then there is rogues, who skip the tagging part usually and come in stealth to snipe your leather by either hiding in invis if their on your faction or just sap you if you are on the other.
---
On a good day, it can be crazy amount of money with just some time keeping and minimum attention. On a bad day it‚Äôs well.. just leave.
---
I would rather uninstall than paying a tank.
---
Nobody needs to look at their ability to remember what keybinding it is, its about the fact that a simple glance over an ability icon displays a ton of information to the point that hiding it is just pure stupidity for nothing more than "style" points.
---
Glancing over an ability icon tells you...
---
1. if you are in range to use.
---
2. if you are in line of sight.
---
3. if you have the resources to use.
---
4. if its off cooldown.
---
5. if its locked out.
---
All of that at a glance, thats the whole point of User Interfaces in the first place which is to convey information in a easily understandable fashion and the simplicity of the ability icon is so good at this that is berserk to see people defending their decision to blind themselves to this information.
---
If you want to play dumb so that your UI looks "clean" by all means do so but to argue its even remotely the same in terms of being optimal is pure ignorance.
---
Of my favourite blades of all times. I use it all the time for cosmetics in retail.
---
I'm leveling full affliction, 38 currently. Really enjoying that! Once I get 40 and get dark pact, gonna be way better.
---
Has been more enjoyable the last 5 levels or so as more talents come online. Rarely eat and/or drink, able to take on any reasonable attack, it's a good time.
---
Also the not waiting 15+ minutes for the tank to get from BB to SM by summoning is awesome!
---
What a psycho. They just need to take the L because thry didn't get the OG name they wanted.

I‚Äôm on Zandalar, RP is great, PVP is great.  Lots of trolls about but fewer since I went to the Eastern continent.

I'm not sure what kinda too good to be true realms you've been playing on, but in my soon 13 years of playing wow, all realms has hade their fair share of infamous guilds. Especially when it comes to PvP guilds.
---
MC can pretty much be steamrolled if you have a few competent people in the raid. You can easily carry a few underperformers or meme specs. It gets harder to accomplish anything with too much of those after BWL, though.

Its chance on landing damaging spell not chance on hit.

I like it was a sick underhanded burn. :)

However, with how parry works, it is to be expected more AA, and if [this source](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry) is correct, it's 0.24 extra swing per parry, which is more rage and threat.

I also pointed out that if you looked at both items isolated, pendant would win by a mile, but that's not to say that it could be replaced by Prestor's Talisman.

Same all my friends were busy and I was like 4 bars off so I just got into a quick lbrs run with randoms and dinged just before the last boss. Was hoping to ding with friends. 
---
Today I got to be with a friend in strat live when he hit 60! We met on stalagg in the 40s and I guess he fell behind. I hit 60 a few weeks ago and wound up transferring to heartseeker, this weekend he joined my new guild on the new server at lvl 57. I was astonished to recognize his name and excited to help him get raid ready. What are the chances we were able to reconnect!

So you lucked out?

I ran so many times brd, can‚Äôt see it. The chest in 2nd run without knowing it dropps there :o
---
The only spell you are casting within cat or bear form is Feral Faerie Fire, and is not a damaging ability, so no. Cat and bear abilities are not spells beyond that.
---
&gt; Resetting an instance is not an exploit.
---
The whole raid doing it continously to look for a rare spawn is kind of an exploit.  It's unintended use of game mechanics.
---
Takes 3 minutes, my ass.  In an ideal world, sure, maybe.  But a pug is about as far from ideal as you can get.

&gt;  And Jed is the only reason most casters even go to UBRS

Then dont join their runs....  Go join the rend/jed groups.

Those guys most likely do a /who Warrior 60 and spam all of them.

I'm no expert but in my experience, when I'm just waiting for my next attack like you talk about I'm using that encounter or that time to build rage. That's what enables the crits all over the place that you're seeing later
---
Wouldn't a paladin tank run out of mana on a long encounter? Eventually the dps are gonna catch up on threat right?
---
Its sexy as hell!
---
I'd say while you are right to a certain degree - I think a lot of People currently just don't want to pay for a tank. While it Speeds things up - People might not worry about that too much.
---
See most People  still Need their own Gold - farm for their Mount - get their enchants and pre-BIS etc..
---
While you would probably be able to do this in 3-4 month time without a Problem. Currently you might find it harder to get a Group.
---
I mean it is up to the Group really. I'd take a great tank in return for some vendor trash for him. If I was melee then especially because I could be sure this tank won't roll on my HoJ :D (if I was a melee) but you get what I mean.
---
Just give everything a bit more time. I guess private Server People are quicker to Level up while the majority of People here is still 40-50^^
---
nope. 
---
offer yourself on trade if you want to be a mercenary prior to the run.
---
but if you join as normal, you can ot expect this.
---
Kungen is by far my favourite!
---
He is so down to earth, takes things lightly and very good at explaining what he is doing and why he is doing it.
---
Thx for the reply! My endgame goal is to get t2 and go pvp a bit. Maybe ill level Engi instead of tailoring and drop my herbalism for tailoring in ph5. What is the first pve upgrade over robe of the void? Robes of Volatile power?
---
Wtf, people do this? I don't want something back in the first place.
---
My mage is now level 38, I have been leveling with quests and spend talent points with a focus on single target.
---
My question is, how do spellcleave dungeon groups work? I keep getting msgs from random people asking me if I wanna join their group, but i have no idea what they are doing or how those groups work. Can any Mage join a spellcleave group or do you need to have the talents for it?
---
edit: Typos
---
Anyone else noticed the ravasaur hunters in un'goro poisoning themselves?
---
#Classic+
---
Why are you thinking of rerolling?
---
that's some steep interest there
---
It is not about the first raid tho. Becuase the price per item is fixed and you get fixed amount per raid, you are always behind someone else by the amount you were behind, when new raid starts. There might be some point squish to lower that difference, but not every guild does that.
---
Exactly how I feel about all the +healing gear. I don‚Äôt understand why so many guides expect you to ignore stats!
---
Pretty much yeh.
---
Rogues have a high damage and are good if you get yourself in sticky situations because of Gouge, Cheap shot and Vanish. Vanish always saves me during a dungeon wipe, not wasting money on a repair bill low level is clutch.
---
aka aoe at blackrock mountain chains. the bigger group wins
---
Hoping someone who knows spriest gearing can give me an assist...  
---
I'm looking to stop levelling my Spriest at 49 and twink out there for a while. I'm not sure whether to prioritise spell damage or more general caster stats...  
---
For example: Dreamweave Gloves (4 int, 7 spirit, +18 spelldamage) vs Jumanza grips (11 int, 10 stam, 10 spirit).   
---
Also I'm a bit confused about specific types of damage vs general spelldamage. Say if one items gives me 18 SPELL damage and another item gives me 12 SHADOW damage, do I effectively have +30 shadow damage?
---
And while rezzing the elevator goes back up, moving the corpse out of range &gt;\_&gt;
---
Guilds that care for pvp have their shamans elemental/resto spec
---
With Undead mobs, Exorcism is sorta like a taunt due to the damage it does. Not sure if it would be consistent though.
---
I'm getting a few whispers but usually to dungeons that aren't popular for healers. Mostly scholo, sometimes lbrs.
---
Untrue, a friend of mine got flagged and had to change so another friend made a character with the flagged name to joke around. Not sure if he would get auto-flagged within some timeframe but he could definitely make a character with that name.
---
his face expression not very good
---
I'm not sure the locations, but there is a Master trainer for each profession somewhere in the world. Might be able to find it by digging around on wowhead. The Master trainer is who makes you an Artisan Alchemist.
---
Hahahaha. My main is Peanutbutter. I just look in the fridge for inspiration.
---
True but since it takes forever, there's always people waiting to do it and your disguise is bound to fall off.
---
Didnt mean full prot, but having like 17p in prot might be helpful if they struggle with threat or tanking in general. You could do arms with anger management and sweeping strikes or fury with enrage and flurry.
---
You do realize that mages get a talent with a pretty high chance of getting 100% mana reduction for their next spell, right? Would be a waste on Frostbolt.
---
Use FR for Rag.. and threat gear for anything else. Your DPS will hate you for not doing enough threat since you are stacking def.
---
&gt; cant report player for some reason from just the chat window
---
https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023
---
You kinda can.
---
you might check but you did not tell others to check and I as a tank can tell you people DONT check where or what you are doing 1st.   you deleted this post because it is clear tank/healers dont want 400 random dps asking them to run stuff, If we want groups we will either A: go to a city and use /2 or join the channel blizzard added to the game called LOOKINGFORGROUP, if you cant fill your group using these channels or your built up friends list/guild then dont start whispering random people,    ALSO stop commenting on a post you deleted.
---
you are a douche
---
This absolutely contradicts my own experience. Are you sure there were no special characters involved?
---
That first link looks like it was on a private server. Looks like when he cone of colds that the mobs should be hitting him at that range. Also doesn't look like batching is active.
---
if you use the same wifi, don't worry about it. Should have the same IP address for both.  
---
you could always use "whatsmyip" website (google it) from both machines, you should have the same IP.
---
This robe is good but not better than Archmage.
---
+3 int(45 mana, 0.05% crit), +10 sta(100 HP) + 10 spirit(a little mana regen OOC + 160 mana on evocate), +1% critical chance, +6 armor.
---
Archmage? +17 spell damage, +500 mana per 5 minutes. 1% critical chance is roughly equal to 7 spellpower. So you'll do quite a bit more damage with Archmage. 100 HP, 45 mana and 16 spirit combined are worth way less than 500 mana on use(every 5 min), whether in a PvP fight or in a dungeon/raid. 6 armor is not worth mentioning.
---
Yes it costs a lot of gold. A rare drop out of MC is a lot of time when spread between the raid. Way more time than it takes to farm a robe of archmage for a mage.
---
Making water is like 1 minute of your time per dungeon group. Tanking a large dungeon is 2 hours of constant focus and stress, because if you brain-afk for 10 seconds during any pull someone probably dies. How you can compare that is beyond me. And as a reward you get yelled at by the Rogue who barely did any more DPS than you because, turns out, you also need on your DPS BiS because raids bring maybe 2 prot tanks and every other warrior is expected to do DPS. 
---
And that's coming from someone who tanked every single dungeon he ran so far, from RFC to UBRS. I'm okay tanking because I know I'm decent at it and I like getting into groups faster. But I fully understand warriors who refuse (side note tho: If you are a warrior, refused the offer to tank the dungeon so the group invited me, and then you roll on my tank gear, get fucked).
---
i've hoped not to watch youtube videos, because i currently am only online via mobile and my traffic is very limited.
---
I still wouldn't call warriors op levelers by any stretch. They just become bearable when you gear them, but that's about it. The only people who would call them OP levelers are people who haven't spent much time learning and leveling other classes.
---
Why is this not happening to me on my priest?!  :'(
---
Yea it‚Äôs hideous lol.
---
Here's what I got. Assuming we're looking for the probability of someone rolling a 99 before anyone rolls a 100 and then at least one person rolling a 100 afterwards, if we add up all of the favorable outcomes:
---
99, 100, [1 to 100], [1 to 100], [1 to 100]: **100^(3)**
---
99, [1 to 99], 100, [1 to 100], [1 to 100]: **99(100^(2))**
---
99, [1 to 99], [1 to 99], 100, [1 to 100]: **(99^(2))100**
---
99, [1 to 99], [1 to 99], [1 to 99], 100: **99^(3)**
---
[1 to 98], 99, 100, [1 to 100], [1 to 100]: **98(100^(2))**
---
[1 to 98], 99, [1 to 99], 100, [1 to 100]: **98\*99\*100**
---
[1 to 98], 99, [1 to 99], [1 to 99], 100: **98(99^(2))**
---
[1 to 98], [1 to 98], 99, 100, [1 to 100]: **(98^(2))100**
---
[1 to 98], [1 to 98], 99, [1 to 99], 100: **(98^(2))99**
---
[1 to 98], [1 to 98], [1 to 98], 99, 100: **98^(3)**
---
and then divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, we get:
---
(100^(3) + 99(100^(2)) + (99^(2))100 + 99^(3) + 98(100^(2)) + 98\*99\*100 + 98(99^(2)) + (98^(2))100 + (98^(2))99 + 98^(3))/100^(5) = **~0.00097035**
---
or about 1/1030.6
---
ownage time
---
Are, you, big enough?
---
What‚Äôs the percent difference there
---
Had a similar situation.  
---
I found my first epic in azshara.  
---
A couple levels later I returned with a friend to kill the giants for the BRD quest and I told him that this is the area where all the epics drop and another one will drop for sure for us now. 2-3 giants later one actually dropped.
---
Can someone explain the strategy for tanking with a DPS warrior in the party, or even what a smart DPS warrior should be doing.
---
The way I see it most DPS warriors are equivalent to a mage who opens with Blizzard full balls to the wall AoE with Whirlwind/Cleave and do nothing else.  The reason it seems to be accepted is Warriors are in tankier gear and can eat a few hits but the issue I have is when my healers are complaining about healing multiple targets or the DPS Warriors start throwing shade at them to do a better job.  I know the meme of 2H tanking, but it really doesn't apply to trash when the healer is struggling and those 2-3 hits per second are not having 50-100 damage shaved off them with a shield, and the fact that DPS warriors unlike people like Skarm are not chugging a 1g pot to boost their armour values.
---
When I have clothies and rogues in the team my attention and cooldowns are going their way, I have to let the DPS warriors deal with their own aoe aggro or its going to end up a bigger mess.  When the healer implores me to do something, and the fact that teams go infinitely smoother without a DPS warrior (even Arcane Explosion happy mages are a breeze to deal with in comparison), I really have nothing besides having a blanket ban on DPS warriors in my teams unless I know the particular warriors/healers have worked well together in the past.
---
im lvl 57 with 600gold
---
what the heck are u doing
---
You're clearly incapable of following the context of a conversation. No one else has been talking about immediately after launch in this thread.
---
Goes well with your green offhand :P
---
I have a somewhat similar issue.
---
I'm a druid specced into hybrid tank/heal spec.  My raiding role is healer. In healing I'm in full pre-raid except cape, belt (random enchantment drop and 500g+ BoE, so substituted with high level +healing greens) AND healing neck from Ramstein. In tank I'm only missing 5 pre-raid pieces and have decent substitutes. 
---
Every healer and their mother wants to run Strat UD for the chest and neck, every dps for hat or cape.
---
The result is several groups at once are looking for Strat UD tanks but since there's almost nothing in it, they can easily spend 40+ minutes looking.
---
I offer these groups to tank the instance under the condition that I roll need on the neck piece (not reserve, just fair and square need roll between me and healer). I don't anything else there (except mount, hah). However, the healers would rather disband and not run at all than have a lower chance of getting the piece.
---
My question is, what gives?
---
Still trying it out for science, I plan on switching to fury and all that against onyxia for threat but thanks for the tip!
---
I would most definitely not level as prot. You can easily tank dungeons up to brd\~ as arms or fury.
---
You mainly lost because your spec is very bad for pvp.
---
Is that Windows Vista?
---
Kratom extract and star bucks espresso shots (cold).
---
Thank me later
---
&gt; lol of course its different. Just because you don't value the reasons why it's different does not mean they don't exist.  
---
Mentally deficient people exist. Me thinking they are stupid is simply accurate.  
---
&gt; Shocking, I know. Is there something about this game that cause only those with social disabilities to play it? Is it like a version of real life where you can hide behind your keyboard and avatar and be as big of a piece of shit as you would really like to be?  
---
Anonymity allows for brutal honesty. Why wouldn't one make use of that feature? That isn't a social disability, that is knowing what you are capable of doing without facing repercussions. And thus "playing" by your own principles. For me that is not whispering rude shit to people, but thinking it and complaining about them.  
---
And there are people like you who invent next level special snowflake reasons just so they can argue and have a "Gottcha!" moment, even if they pull the most abstract shit out of their arse which they stubbornly argue for to _win_ the argument.
---
It's not an exploit... just like layer hopping or that cauldron bug in retail ;) There is a large gray area in WoW for things that are allowed.
---
Any tips on soloing arena? I'd imagine the first wave to be harder than the boss.
---
Desolace beasts until 40. You make a lot of gold by vendoring grey items.
---
pretty sure the growth rating is 0.2 per point up to 305 even though you have more than 305, otherwise 305 would be better than 307 - which is not the case.
---
You have to stand there and target him while party wants to run the instance ;)
---
Sorry man! Went to Payogamertv, who was spanish with spanish titles for his videos :D
---
My bad!
---
I didn't say it wasn't.
---
But it's also the best tanking class in the game for most situations. Which means that if I have four group applications, three of which are from classes who can't go tank, then I will ask you whether you can tank.
---
Too*
---
For two whole minutes, boo hoo.
---
Sure, I hope your honesty gets you far in life.
---
Heartseeker hasn‚Äôt been low pop since the last transfers. In fact it isn‚Äôt even the lowest pop bottom three anymore it‚Äôs disgustingly too big.
---
Plenty of tools for a palatank to gain mana through seals. Also between threat buffs and talents, no way DPS can rip aggro from a couple of consecration, especially if you throw a higher rank for good measure.
---
Worse case, if you have a DPS in your group who's just too strong, you can throw them a threat-reducing blessing.
---
gz on 13g
---
Lawls no
---
Yep, warriors would already pull half of the instance by that time rushing to Rend ;)
---
I'm pretty sure +dmg is the best stat for any caster, including mages. The exception would be if you aoe-grind you need a big enough mana pool/int to cast enough spells for the mobs to die.
---
I have a Razer Naga. Also I'm a healer and use healbot. I normally have everything changed with bartender, just not at the moment.
---
Lottery Numbers???
---
The other one rolled 1, right?
---
I'd say keep Felheart. The hit is really nice, and hard to come by otherwise. RotV is better on paper, but leveling Tailoring just for the one item is not worth it in my eyes. If you're not in a super tryhard minmax guild (which you apparently aren't), it won't matter.
---
Are you the guild's main enhance shaman?  There is typically only ever one in a raid.  I would assume that is what the charter means.
---
No, its kinda a dick move, but keep telling yourself that you are alright.
---
yes, i got my wardens staff for 169 gold, no need for my own post but happy for the price i paid.
---
How do you actually make sure someone isn't doing this? (assuming something like a chest roll)
---
I did this for like a dozen people in my guild, didn't want interest or anything.. and eventually got kicked for a stupid reason.
---
man i used a rick and morty meme earlier and they deleted my shit lol
---
fuck off you know i didn't get my grade 10
---
The old fashioned way. I‚Äôve got two accounts I just keep a data entry of certain things. I can who every zone and count manually doing specific /who‚Äôs and that‚Äôs how I get a count. Some guy did it for a week on discord tor all the 60s he had seen and he counted them up where it became 75% alliance to 25% horde for level 60s. It‚Äôs sad.
---
Mm yes, yes they where. 
---
Atleast in my experience. Honestly shocked when i returned and found out this seems to be the general consensus.
---
Then you have to think this is reddit, where most users are north american. One of the greediest people on earth. So the experience on EU realms is a bit different.
---
Problem I have with spy is that it doesn't track the death/kills that well. Moments where I get ganked and I gank the dude back 2 times but when I check the counters it says 1 kill, 0 deaths.
---
It's a different style of game, much more community focused than anything. More modern games, are far too instant gratification focused and flashy for individuals rather than focusing on the team.
---
Combat in classic is much slower paced, and relies on a lot more preparation in terms of the player before the encounter, rather than in it.
---
Catch up with your secondary proffessions like fishing and cooking. 
---
Or search for some gear upgrates to chase after.
---
Farm some gold for later on or buy some gear improvements for your alt.
---
Or just play some other games
---
You can turn them off in plater and use the ‚ÄòClassic Castbars‚Äô Addon as a replacement.
---
It's not about demanding or refusing though. It's about complaining that you get asked in the first place. A lot of groups are looking for tanks, yet we have enough mages, warlocks, rogues and hunters to field an entire army.
---
And there's another reason I am less likely to take a warrior DPS into pre-raid environments. They are ace when it comes to dealing damage, but they will roll on the warrior tank's gear. That makes another plate tank joining less likely. With more DPS than we need and it sometimes becoming harder to find a tank, yes, I am inclined to ask whether you can tank. And if you don't want to, that's fine. 
---
The rogue thing is a constant though. I got yelled at by the warrior for rolling on Ravager on my shaman alt. This isn't tank exclusive.
---
Yes this is how it was back in vanilla but with spell batching it seems it seems even more delayed.
---
While healers are in demand, tanks are in even shorter supply.
---
I say ditch the laziness. I spent some 45 minutes setting up a BRD group as healer, checking in LFG channel every few minutes and eventually resorted to whispering all warriors and druids in an appropriate level bracket. Rather than just going "TANK BRD???" I did my best to be polite and modest in my request, and after some 20-25 turndowns (Sat evening, people were busy/going out) I finally found a tank for the run, and it was a nice and smooth run in the end.
---
What's even better, though, is that about 25-33% of the tanks I whispered who did not join that time asked me to add them to Friends and said they'd be up for running it another night. Been running end-game dungeons with a handful of said people since, and made some good in-game friends in the process. 
---
A bit of politeness can go a long way!
---
*shrug* 
---
There‚Äôs a reason why no one has bothered to write an addon for that. 
---
There‚Äôs years of historically accurate BiS lists that negate any of that. 
---
Simming is for retail where drops have RNG traits.
---
Does it work on just one mob at a time, or can it proc on multiple?
---
I got mine yesturday aswell. After 5 runs at lvl 58. Can‚Äôt complain hehe
---
they give such good exp, so it's def worth to farm them. Also like the picture above - easy money.
---
Nice
---
I'm going through somewhat similar atm, respect for making these videos.
---
For those who are misunderstanding:
---
&gt;	My bf recently got me into it and im loving it. Im a druid night elf. Going to start making potions soon! 
---
Refers to the commenter 
---
&gt;	I hope she enjoys it :)
---
Refers to OP's wife
---
Typical redditor and new generation gamer. A bunch of virtue signalers only looking for fake internet points to validate their actions and exhistance, none of it is real, just fake sjw signaling
---
Is there such a thing as too many healers?
---
You are strong and wise and I‚Äòm very proud of you.
---
Solo?! Can you show me a vid of how?
---
once you go fire bloodvine is better
---
I really wanted to enjoy it. I love the idea of mixing fantasy with the modern world. But I slept through it twice.
---
Are you on Rattlegore?
---
Woudn't that be Goblins? Gnomes are basically tech nerds.
---
Of course you want NOED nerfed with an attitude like that.
---
I see, you're not here to discuss this, just throw around nationalistic insults. There were plenty of people in vanilla who ninja'd, and a simple Google search will prove it. Try to have a good day.
---
Fresh pasta, tasty
---
What will stop me from rolling need for the item that I actually NEED if it's reserved? Nothing. I would just say that yeah, cool, it's reserved, but still would roll need, cuz these items are still very rare to be dropped, for example Ironfoe.
---
Screw these reserved item groups, I will do as I please, and it won't be loot ninja act or I just don't give a fuck.
---
Like silk comes out of a worm, Mageweave comes out of a mage?
---
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
---
No idea what happend, but nice clean UI!
---
&gt;Terrible idea not to commit. You only have 20 levels to go and you‚Äôll have a class that will generate easy money for the entirety of classic WoW.
---
Disagree. This is a game, not a job, despite what many will have you believe here. If you don't enjoy what you play, then make another class. This is ultimately about fun and enjoyment. The real terrible idea would be deleting the class. Your level 40 mage will always be there to pickup again if you decide to devote time to another class.
---
I was a Warrior back in the days and got kicked way too many times for rolling on leather/mail for my DPS Gear. 
---
I was kicked from my guild, because i was unorthodox i guess (ran fury back in the day and made more dps than our guildlead (rogue) and one of my friends (rogue, too).) After i was kicked another friend(warrior) joined the guild and did arms. The Rogue-Friend trashtalked me so that i got kicked and the warrior-friend could join. We are not friends anymore. Got this info from a priest-friend (we are still friends).
---
so yeah. Friendships got broken because of wow. But i think it was for the better.
---
First thing I learned while playing a warrior tank: Only start my own groups.
---
My words seem to just carry more weight when I'm party leader, wonder why that is. I've had DPS just be assholes and once even mocked me for not keeping up with them. Never had that problem when I had the option to kick them.
---
Frankly I think most DPS are just braindead when there's nobody actually in charge. Be the guy in charge.
---
I think you should have a bigger chance to find somebody if you just ask on that server (or on some russian community forum).   Not many people here will play on a russian server.
---
Now I want a ten gallon hat for my Tauren.
---
You dont play hemo with dagger in MH in Classic
---
Text won't be the right color
---
&gt;I just don't think people realize that others arent going to do something for you unless they get a benefit out of it. I have helped a ton of guildies get their bis without charging anything but im not going to do that for some random person I don't know on the server.
---
Its not really greedy when I gain nothing from tanking the dungeon. I already have most of my bis gear from mc/ony.
---
With a little effort you can shitlist guys like this and ruin their reputation. take screenshots and link them to trial rank players in their guild
---
Well ill be getting that Nearby addon.
---
They‚Äôre both strong healing classes. The pally is the best single target healer, whereas priests are probably the best all round healer with the most versatile healing toolkit.
---
I personally find the priest a lot more fun since pally levelling is essentially autoattacking mobs to death and their healing is pretty much spamming the same 1-2 spells.
---
Another point I‚Äôd raise in favour of priest is you don‚Äôt have to carry an extra armour set since your levelling gear also works well for healing, whereas Pallies will have to carry around healing gear to swap over to when doing dungeons.
---
Second this. I dont care about seeing 100 different posts about the AAAAA roll, albeit funny.. its just spam at this point
---
pretty much the same. did some time in IT customer support. yes, I phrased it like that on purpose.
---
Oh right, I forgot emote text is different
---
Is joke
---
Or they won‚Äôt.  Really depends on nothing really.
---
The opposite happened to me. I was helping some guildies with Only attunement, killing dragons and whelplings. Some random priest was struggling and I had already finished attunement so I told them I'd drop group so he could join.
---
We pull a mob, I drop group, he gets in, I finish killing the mob for them. Epic dagger drops for them.
---
It went to a guildy who sent it to the gbank so I wasn't mad but damn that was some luck.
---
I got the onehanded sword from Onyxia a few days ago :D it was my 4th Ony kill
---
I‚Äôm a priest so my only ‚Äòcc‚Äô really is psychic scream.
---
OOTL, explain?
---
Not sure if you are aware, but you don't need Tailoring for Bloodvine itself, only for the set bonus (2% crit). That being said, I hope you have a Mining alt, to support Engineering. ;)
---
The name was 'spankdaddy', so sure about that!
---
drop resolution down to 720p and play on minimum and it should run fine even on integrated gpus
---
I mean yeah that's the fastest way for sure but were talking an EK run from UC to BB. No kalimdoor allowed
---
That is quality content here!
---
I bought a 40 dollar craidslist craptop. Havent tried any serious stuff but it runs fine( once it finally turns on).
---
I got a lot of whispers while I was leveling (usually several a day). I don't think I got any on lvl 60 yet. Got 1 whisper asking for a healer.
---
Then again I'm only 60 for a couple of days, so not a lot of time to spread my name.
---
I mean... What even is hardcore at this point in the game?
---
Epic mount and MC/Onyxia on farm?
---
My guild is doing split runs and clearing onyxia with 22 people in each raid. MC is probably next on the split raid schedule when we get tanks ready.
---
The content is really easy and as people start getting properly geared it's a lot of "what do we do now?".
---
Making a couple of Hand of Rag is fine. Guilds who play this much have enough gold going around anyways.
---
As a mage I don't expect people to tip me nor would I even accept it in dungeons. It's part of my role and it makes it easier for the whole group. That's like if shaman's would want to be tipped to put down a totem.
---
Same here. Usually chill guy... Once I beat a guys ass senseless(talking face hematoma) in a internet caffe for using pots in a duel although we agreed not to.
---
In my own experience, they are either like that in RL, too, or are basement dwellers who can't get a word out in an actual real discussion.
---
Back in the days i stumbled upon this quest and quickly decided it was impossible solo even with my shiny raid gear. Was still doing BRD for hand of justice so i did what  anyone would do. I dragged my entire dungeon group there before going into BRD :P Never saw anyone doing that quest back then but i guess questie is bringing people over there this time around.

The frog fish still boggles me. For the longest time I only saw a frog.
---
But that post was in the begging of the sub-reddit. 
---
Are people still talking about it?
---
what about a totally different class?  Or is that blasphemy?
---
Yes, as I said, you should get a chance to roll on that item for healing. I don't know why they keep leaving.
---
The problem is, I would like to do PvE content and I would prefer healing, but as stated, way too many healers on my realm (Zandalar Tribe RP-PvP). Yesterday when I went to a dungeon (as dps because they already had a healer) our party was made of a tank and 4 priest. And not because they are dps but because they cant get in as a healer. I have never experienced such before
---
It's because people realised you dont actually need to cc 80% of the pack and kill it one by one if everyone in your group has a functioning brain.
---
Really? So, I'm a hunter and I've got a BP with 25 Agi and 10 Stamina. Then a blue BP with 8 Stamina, 8 Int, and 2% crit drops. Which one is better?
---
So you are telling me if you were the best-geared tank on the server you would tank dungeons for free for everyone out of the kindness of your heart. LMFAO say bye to having your epic mount
---
Its nice to have a thank you for helping, but I wouldnt get offended by no reaction. Like you said it's a selfless act, expecting recognition is just a way to feed your ego.
---
I love solo questing purely for the challenge, putting yourself in hard situations and getting through them is the best way to improve as a player. I know that from nearly 2 decades of playing fps games. 
---
Once I was doing the Southsea pirate quests (I was 1 or 2 levels below the mobs) with my priest on my own when a mage comes invites me a couple of times, then starts flaming me when I declined. He was calling me toxic, arrogant, stupid as well as other things.. I died twice and both times he just watched, laughed and flamed me. I'm the toxic one? I certainly didn't want or expect help, but his reaction was just childish.
---
Yes, there is. This was seen in private servers already. But opted to still do a shaman. Its hard to get 5man groups going, but once you are in raid gear, it doesnt really matter.
---
As a tank the hardest thing is the guy whispering you every hour after you ve done one dungeon with him acting super friendly like you re best friend forever. Everytime I have to make up stories to deny his request and I feel bad for him everytime even if I don't know him at all &gt;&gt;
---
didnt find out about it until lvl 59 lmao. Had been asking in cities the whole time.
---
It's just threat management. Just /dance with the horsie until the paladins pewed it enough.
---
Granted it's making things more difficult than they need to be, but isn't that why we're playing classic anyway?
---
Mate, that's the bloody Australia addon.
---
I hit 40 on my warrior bought my mount and had to put that character aside for a few days. Crossing those thresholds really does fatigue you. I got some alts to 10 and did some questing for gold and dungeons on my main for bis before coming back
---
I'm looking at getting an ultrabook for when I go travelling such that I can have off days playing WoW when I feel drained. From the research I've done it sounds like most of the integrated graphics solutions will play it in some capacity (Intel HD620 is pretty common).
---
ya ret is really fucking strong on the one fight in bwl that has a million skeles for them to AOE. fucking lmao. Their single target dps is fucking trashcan tier.
---
i should add im pretty much full holy spec xD
---
Paladins are safe, but slow levellers. Unless you want to be a supporting unit in mass PvP change class now before you invest too much.
---
1v1 / small PvP fights in the world are not in the paladins favor.
---
Saying that, prot does okay vs rogues later on... but sucks for leveling/has mana issues galore.
---
If the mage wasnt wiping you guys its insanely rude to just kick him. Why are you proud of this?
---
I stole the guys elite mob, I felt bad after. But don't regret saving time. Thanks for the Horde!
---
Keep on keeping on. ü§ôüèª

Too many BiS-nerds who will probably never even raid and even then it's mostly not needed.

Tbh, how can you remember that ? Im willing to bet, you have no idea how it was back then, but have gotten used to faster, reactive games (and because wow back then was the best game available, it must have felt reactive too).
---
And i played in open beta + vanilla.
---
There is a really nice discord bot called Raid Helper. It lets you create a raid event where ppl sign up just by simply pressing theyr class icon on the event. Looks really clean and pro.
---
Arms. And the shaman might want to not go enh because you guys will compete for loot (weps, str stuff). Wfury totem is MORE than enough
---
Can confirm the stunresist exists.
---
ffs
---
ha I had someone whisper me from Org for some water while I was in Azshara farming felcloth and insisted I can just port to them quickly, no big deal.  I couldn't believe the entitlement
---
I recently read that layering will soon be removed, how will that affect the price of companion pets like Dark Whelpling? I've been trying to get it myself but I'm leaning towards buying one from AH before layering is removed, as I suspect the prices will jump for any items with rare drop chance as supply dramatically decreases. Currently they're going for 70g at my server, how far will you think the price will climb after layering is removed? What were the prices in Vanilla back in the day for these pets?
---
SAY MY NAME WHEN YOU PRAY
---
Yeah i know but I am asking about the scorpid.
---
Nah. Always tip in town, never tip in group - you don't tip warlock for summoning you, this isn't USA.
---
I know it‚Äôs up for debate, but I‚Äôm trying to avoid pseudo substance atm. Cbd, Kratom, etc. if I compromise there it‚Äôs like why not just do the real thing at that point? Tried harm reduction for awhile and it always got me in trouble.
---
I did rfd runs quite a while ago on pserver so take it with a grain of salt and can't verify because I am not playing rogue in classic.
---
Take the right path at the entrance, kill glutton (careful he has a pulsing aoe that can get you out of stealth) when he is in between mob packs on his patrolling route. He is the hardest boss here, pop cooldowns. Then you go up the spiral, there is a rare spawn boss on the way and usually a chest, kill the end boss. Obviously pickpocket everything on the way. Then you jump down the spiral and head straight back the way you came in.
---
Consistently got me about 30-35g per hour.
---
Being a dickhead by repeatedly killing someone (especially lower levels) and engaging in world pvp are two very different things.
---
What's even worse is being a dickhead at the expense of someone innocent just because somebody was dickhead to me.
---
Hes french canadian but streams in english, def check him out hes funny as fuck
---
TO THE SKIES
---
Haha that‚Äôs awesome! Shoulda frostbolted you when I had the chance ;)
---
‚ÄúKing‚Äù is also considered mature language somehow
---
I see. Scorpid got buffed in later expansions. I "believe" it's useless right now.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt worry to much I ran cath where we had 4 glove drops, gauntlets of divinity are much better anyway :D
---
Walking around for 20 minutes ;)
---
I've done 2 BRD full runs so far (I'm the healer).
---
One was with a level 46 Druid and another was with a level 45 Tank. Both properly specced and decently geared.
---
The first group we cleared up to Torch Room, the second we didn't even clear half of the dungeon.
---
Druids are viable tanks except maybe for raiding - whoever tells you otherwise is a fool.
---
i know full well what im getting into as i knew nothing to start i did a bunch of research and paly just stuck with me haha im happy not being the big dick player killer i just wanted to know if im doomed to die while stunned to rogues lol
---
Hands of power from LBRS. Last time i saw them, a 58lvl gotten them :( . doesnt help that nobody wants to do this dungeon and full run is usually lengthy. I an on my 19th run already
---
On any server that you play on, there will be a huge tank shortage and the other classes will never be as "in demand". It's just the way it always is. Healers are usually the 2nd hardest to find, but still normally very easy to find compared to tanks. It might take a minute or two but you can usually find a healer very quickly - tanks can take 20+ mins to find sometimes. I've even seen tanks charging a "service fee" of 1-2g from each of the other members. DPS are almost always available at the drop of a hat. 
---
Sounds like your server might have a higher population of healers than most? Either way, no matter what server you play on you'll never be truly in-demand like a tank as a healer. If you want to be able to pick and choose which group you join because everyone is crying out for you (e.g. you can only join groups that only needs 1 tank and then good to go, no waiting, and have a warlock with summon ready) then you'll need to be a tank. No other roles have that luxury. 
---
If you switch server you might have more luck, I play priest and I've never experienced healers begging for a group to take them, I usually find groups fairly swiftly, but often have to wait for a tank or start whispering random warriors. But as mentioned, if you want to be the "in demand" guy, then tank is the only choice. 
---
Nobody can tell you "you should" or "you shouldn't" reroll tank. You need to weigh up the pros and the cons (easy to find groups vs its not really your favourite role) and make tha decision yourself.
---
Paladins can just AoE grind instances out.
---
I went from ST questing to aoe dungeon farming. From 37 to 44 I was in SM cath only so zero world pvp.
---
Its boring, slow groups feel like time wasted, replacing people and finding new groups take time and feels like time wasted. Its boring as hell..
---
But when you find that 5 runs an hour group that stays together it feels so nice. Gold income isn't to good but you will end up getting lots of exp fast.
---
Right now I'm 45 and going to do ZF till 48-isch followed by solo aoe runs in maraudon till 51.
---
Its really boring but its fast. You miss out on alot that classic has to offer so only go for it if speedleveling is your thing.
---
*Jodie Whittaker intensifies*
---
I like that it's pretty clean, but for me, the bottom of the screen is a little too cluttered with buttons, and you can't see anything at the bottom if threat + damage are filled.
---
[This is mine.](https://i.imgur.com/0ZKhosC.jpg)
---
I have different settings too, with smaller chat (or no chat at all), no damage meter, or with additional threat meter etc.
---
You didn‚Äôt mess up, this is pretty normal.  I‚Äôm sure I did the same back when I started vanilla.  Keep in mind that your gold/day is a lot higher at 60, so just keep leveling.  Your ability to ‚Äúpower level‚Äù lagging skills at 60 is a lot better too
---
Good luck forging the hammer when nobody wants to go raiding with you because you're a scammer :D
---
Some people are just plain stupid....
---
Ye I agree, as a mage I don't worry much about threat with all the shields, ice novas, ice blocks
---
&gt; it's 0.24 extra swing per parry, 
---
Its 0.24 extra swings at **Average** per parry. Its still based on RNG and doesn't matter at all if your MH is fast. And you have a funny way to translate that to damage and threat. Its still less significant then the rage you lose from parryin. The only upside is that you avoid that damage. Thats it, don't try to twist into "Its more threat to parry an attack" because its not.
---
Reminds me when I ressed a person, but she accepted it too late and elevator started moving again, killing her for the second time.
---
On my server the bottleneck for UBRS full runs are usually healers rather than tanks. But that is really the exception, I guess there isn't a lot of interesting healer loot after Rend.
---
Maybe they just don't like watching mediocre old shows?
---
This would be funnier if he was shouting KAAAAAMEEEEHAAAAAAA...
---
Probably for the spell crit aura
---
Classic PvP problem. Be it ganking and corpse camping people forever or bridging in an armada of blops on that lonely Caracal, "hardcore" PvPers tend to push too hard and ruin their own community. Don't be surprised if most PvP servers are PvE in a couple of months.
---
AOE Trinkets and Threat
---
I enjoy tanking as a druid, but I was wondering about the different methods of increasing my AOE threat beyond self-HOTing before pulls and swipes.  Would trinkets like Six Demon Bag or Smokey's Lighter significantly help build and maintain AOE threat?  I don't lose out on my defensive trinkets like Smoking Heart of the Mountain since one of my addons automatically replaces my trinkets once they go on CD.
---
"OHHHH HE NEEDS SOME MILK!"
---
Against a good rogue yeah. I‚Äôd swap to sword and shield when a rogue wants to fight (I carry them in my bags).
---
Use seal of justice and devotion aura. Other than that it‚Äôs just bloody difficult.
---
Doesn't make it any less specific tho
---
Yeah, he says, "aside from toetime"
---
What did toetime do to not be on the list?
---
And here I am not even downloaded the game yet.
---
Yes, I would. There are other ways to make money. You even get gold from just money drops from mobs. Then there's a chance to get an item while putting greed with everyone else. Professions. Flipping the AH. Getting lucky with a drop like Warden Staff. Grinding. Et cetera.
---
Believe it or not I even made decent money with fishing and cooking.
---
Also it's good to have
---
Play what you have most fun with playing, its not worth it playing a Tank when you get annoyed quickly because as a tank in classic you are basicly a babysitter to lots of DPS meter kids. 
---
There are a few reasons why there are more healers than tanks, biggest of them is leveling as a Tanks means you have to spam dungeons or suffer the incredible slow questspeed. Another would be you need way more healer then Tanks in Raids.
---
Not really. It‚Äôll be hard to afford a mount at 40 but quest good rewards ramp up, so if you‚Äôre careful with your gold you should be able to buy a mount by your mid 40s.
---
If you put all the time reroll would take into farming - you‚Äôll be better of farming, although it may feel more boring.
---
If you‚Äôre really worried, you could drop herbalism and pickup shining, and then farm turtles for a decent gold/hr.
---
Respec costs do come down each month, but you‚Äôll want to avoid a respec between now and 60.
---
I mean I can't buff you back as warrior anyways, but whenever I get healed (especially in a bad situation) I write a quick /s ty or /s thanks.  I would expect that from others, too, otherwise I'd think twice if I help out again. I won't get salty if somebody doesn't say anything, and of course I won't harass people by following or whispering them.
---
you sure you got enough meters there?
---
I wait only one thing when I give buff or heal, the same help when I need. For example when I help someone and in the next second  a horde player randomly attack me I except for some help but a lot of people just run away and leave me in s*it.
---
what mouse are you using? if its a logitech you sure have the logitech gaming software installed.

TL;DR
---
* Hit cap for those who have 305 weapon skill or more is 6% instead of 9%
---
* Glancing blows happen 40% of the time, this doesn't change no matter the weapon skill.
---
* Glancing blows damage can be increased with higher weapon skill to a maximum of 95% of normal damage with 308 weapon skill.
---
He wasn't actual tank though, he was a paladin rofl
---
Professions really won‚Äôt be making you much gold until the later stages 200-250+. A lvl 35 character can rank professions all the way to 300 so if you do want to reroll that is a good stopping point. Mages can also make and sell portal services st 40.
---
Respeccing costs are reduced by 5g each month so its really not the end of the world! 
---
If you‚Äôre feeling disheartened with this toon you could set it a side and try something different for a bit and decide what to do with It later.
---
Past lvl 40 gold making really Ramps up from quests and dungeons and mages are great at aoe farming mobs. Restarting professions at 100 isn‚Äôt terrible either
---
I am in the same boat, that is why I was looking forward to doing bg's, I was always pvp focused anyways.  It wasn't after I started playing that I found out bg's weren't available right away.  I also liked bg's to break up the constant questing while leveling.  :(
---
Just 4 stacks of milk visible would have been good. The're already stacks of 20.
---
This is before selecting any character for the free migration. In the full server queue. I click the button "Character migration" and this shows up. ... or do I have to clean all characters on the server for a possible migration (empty AH, empty mailbox, no guildmaster, etc...?)
---
You've spent alot of time learning to play mage in both dungeons and solo. You've also gotten to level 32 which is somewhat time consuming. All of this has value. Even if you're broke in gold right now. Gold will come. Don't worry to much about it.
---
1g is fine for easy to get enchants, like if you are just getting a minor speed to boots or something.  But if you're getting enchants that have a big formula cost behind them don't be a cheap ass.  Crusader and some of these other formulas cost 200+ gold.  And if your server is like mine, there are only a couple people with spell power and healing to weapon so far and honestly they can charge whatever they want!  Enchanting is not a cheap profession to level and get all the formulas for.  I have easily spent 500+ gold on formulas so far.

Desktop Ryzen 3 2200G can burn through Classic on mode 4 at 3440x1440 with 70-80FPS. A mobile variant of Ryzen or a laptop with MX150, MX250 should do similarly, better when at 1080p.
---
Imagine playing the game with PVE as the end goal. Yikes.
---
Nothing you can do when you pull aggro off your paladin "tank" with a single heal.
---
No.
---
If people agree on it, it's a win-win situation.
---
Also, questing/farming can be tedious without DPS gear, so yes, they are allowed to ask - if people refuse, then they can look for another tank and nobody is feeling robbed at the end of the day.
---
Not true.. The Hammer is BiS till AQ40/Naxx since it is the only weapon with the highes Weapon-Damage and highest DPS you can get. Which makes Slam-Warrior / MS-Warrior and Spam-Hamstring-Warrior  superior. But dont forget Shamans and Paladin get the most profit out of it because of Spell-Power-Scaling with AQ-Gear. Why they use Sulfuron as the Main weapon and BiS till Naxx.
---
This is new then. Loot rules where well-known when I played vanilla, and on pservers. The few ninja looters I encountered never even used this excuse themselves.
---
‚ÄûYou are a great employee, but we need you in the position you are!‚Äú
---
I understand what you're saying and I've had the same experience myself, usually I ask them to chill 1-2 seconds so I can grab aggro and pray I hold it or I'm just angry the whole time while trying to keep aggro.
---
Other times the random warrior quickly learn to avoid going balls to the walls eventually when our healer simply ignore him and or tell him that he need to chill out.
---
I'm usually with a priest (healer) and shaman (ele/resto) on any group I do, so we can usually deal with it thanks to communication among us and outward communication.
---
But it is definitively easier just to just blanket ban them to avoid the extra work sadly (also the damn ele shamans do take aggro like no other, but that's another discussion).
---
That being said, having an warrior dps in ubrs etc (10man) compared to 5man is beautiful, they can act as an off-tank if they manage their CDs.
---
Read somewhere that the crit aura is not giving enough to cover the difference between boomkin and normal dps :D

Thorium runs
---
I love the poison effect, but it's only useful in pvp (because it will be hard to remove your stings). In PvE owls are fat best in my opinion because of screech.
---
I like to have my pvp pet, my raid pet and my solo content pet. Although I suggest to get the pets you like.
---
&gt; It's kind of annoying to see it.
---
Weirdly I get constant whispers as a Warlock, didn't know I'd be in high demand. I mean it's all for cleaving groups that pull with the eye or something (I have no idea how to and don't have any interest) but hey at least it's attention.
---
I see Nestle has started playing classic.

Reminds me of the best WoWhead comment i ever read (that i can't for the life of me find right now, else i'd link). Regarding the horde only escort quest in ashenvale, where you rescue the bear from the furbolgs.
---
The comment read something along the lines of *"Best way to deal with Ruul Snowhoof: /point at him in his cage, /laugh and keep on walking by"*
---
That dude has nerves of steel. One one attempt he just kept on truckin when the "special delivery just for this escort quest"-pack of Forbolgs spawned. RP-Walked right into the next camp of Furries and got both of us killed.
---
&gt; Who's complaining? 
---
YOU ARE !?
---
&gt; It's kind of annoying to see it
---
I think it would be  be a good idea with some tweaks:
---
Have this core group of guild dungeoneers, but also make a list of reliable guests that like the idea and want to join regularly, but also want to stay in their own (raiding) guild.   
---
In raiding guilds you usually have 3 kind of people:
---
1. Those that never want to do a dungeon unless a quest forces them. 
---
2. Those that want to dungeon all the time (it's 23:45, you just finished Onyxia + BWL and they shout: 'who want to go Stratholme Living?')
---
3.  Those in between, who sometimes do a dungeon if people need help.
---
Get a mouse over macro for sunder. Makes your life much easier. I bind it to my mouse wheel.
---
You dont really even make gold until like L36-37. Then the amount of gold you generate will shoot up ( to prepare you to get a mount ). Respec costs will drop slowly (but not under 10g), so no worries there, nothing really lost there. And you are a mage, making gold is what you guys can do. 
---
Especially when Diremaul comes, then you can grind solo easy.
---
I tanked BRD today up to the seven at lvl 52 (dinged 52 in the dungeon). It was fine, but some bosses hit hard (golem lord onwards) and the fire damage from elementals was rough. Couldn't get past the Lyceaum because of agro. It was challenging and fun!
---
You can't stand in the fart cloud, it does too much damage. Tell your garbage DPS to calm their tits while she is farting around, save your intercept so you can quickly connect when she's done, spam sunder/revenge and nothing else. I know it's hard for DPS to understand anything but mashing their dumb face against the keyboard every waking minute but they have to learn sometime. Actually, when I think about it, they never seem to learn looking at the Onyxia PUGs I've seen.

Thanks for sharing. Gonna steak this

He probably knew the kiting trick where you pull him back to grimlock so you don't get any adds.

Westfall alliance is flooded. I rerolled to rogue as it's even lower pop than druid and am having no trouble getting spots, tanks are tough to come by.
---
And here I am, grinding ores day in and out, am at 17g.. And it's fun!
---
Yes, a friend got me into playing Wow Classic and I enjoy it! Very different as you sad, but when I just wanna chill at home, this is the game I go with.
---
I think most Tanks would much rather play as DPS, but the second they join a group they are almost expected to tank, lest the entire group risk disbanding due to the current shortage of tanks in general.
---
Therefore, I would say since the Tank is absolutely the most valuable member of any group at the moment (in terms of how difficult it is to find a replacement), it is fair for them to **request** to roll on DPS gear. 
---
The group can by all means decline the request, the tank can offer his services elsewhere and the group can do their damnedest to find another tank. I for one would accept the request because unlike every other roll and class, good tanks are NOT a dime a dozen.
---
Not trying to defend anyone (I'm not even on Stalagg) but in your 2nd Screenshot he says there is a "lack of presence of a shaman". So he does say you're the only one but that you weren't present... Am I missing something?

That is your problem.

wtf does this screenshot even show

You can't levitate anyone but yourself in classic :/

&gt;while classic it seems like valuable BOE drops should be ~~greeded~~  needed by everyone.

corrected it for you.

All greed leads to ninjas and drama  (4 greed, the last roller needs and says tyvm, arrivederci and HS out)   
---
If everybody needs, it will be fair for everybody. Al have 20% chance on this jackpot item.   It doesn't matter if some can use it and some can not, most that could use it would rather have 300g anyway than a marginal upgrade that will be replaced by a raid drop anyway.
---
Not enough information. What about server for a start?

Shittier UI  in 2019 then 2012. Interesting

Poster asking if they have master loot on, they say yes, then poster leaves group. You use master loot to assign loot.

Edgemasters is BiS for non-human/orc players. So is Obsidian Edged Blade.

For humans bis is flamegauntlets out of mc and sword from rag.
---
You keep responding saying the same thing and people are telling you why you're wrong. It's not just one person doing this, it's the guild leader. You blacklist the entire guild and Kill on Sight until either they kick out their guild leader or the guild is disbanded.

Exactly my thought. OP‚Äôs greed ruined it a bit.

Rend does more damage than hamstring, not able to skill up as many times on the same mob

I think icy veins has a ton of research that answers your questions.

Aggro on DPS is a DPS problem. Aggro on healer is a tank problem.

how does this make them a ninja looter, we have 0 context

Verigan's Fist. It starts in the stormwind cathedral area from a guy with a blue ? above him, you then have to go to SFK, Deadmines, BFD, and Loch Modan to collect items to craft it. It's also how you learn the spell Sense Undead.

How about this: grow up.

Wanting to black list people forever because they trolled you (you might have deserved it) is very silly. Especially over an item that doesn‚Äôt even matter.
---
I leveled ret til 50, it was fun and when u are really well geared (happened at 30ish and 40ish) it was fast. Outside those times it was a bit slower. Tanked pre 45 as ret but once you begin to party with 50+ the threat becomes heavy and improved ret, consecration and holy shield become much more useful. 
---
I am currently lvl 52 as prot - regular leveling is slow but theres always dungeon runs available which helps.
---
I full appreciate all of those things - but that was kind of my question, what builds did people go for that were just ‚Äòfun and cool‚Äô to play, not the optimum, but an interesting twist
---
All of your replies have massively helped me decide to carry on this mage venture without any further damn respeccing. Learned a few bits too
---
My sword skill is 300 so leveling up is possible
---
Good luck raiding cities with dishonorable kills..
---
Nice one.. lucky lucky!
---
Because I forgot I can screenshot from keyboard
---
Many will probably level up another char or so.
---
If you get tired of playing, do something else. Forcing yourself to like something backfires eventually.
---
He bought all skills, that's not modest at all!

KURINNAXX REPRESENT!

100% agree.

When everybody needs, you give everybody a fair chance (20%) 
---
See my comment elsewhere in this topic for the rational explanation.
---
I say "good to go" because I'm a warlock and we can all be in the dungeon within a few minutes thanks to the summon portal.
---
Why is it always Mograine when it comes to rude players like this? Is it something in the mage water?
---
Theres PLENTY of healers that want UD runs and have one of those pieces. So im sure you can still find people that HAVE the neck and need chest. When you find a capable one, just friend list him and run it over and over.
---
Can confirm, survived multiple wipes with vanish.
---
SHOUT FOR THE MODS!
---
They say they don't want witch hunts, but witch hunts are a thing in vanilla wow and it is a good thing to do. By censoring us showcasing assholes they are protecting the ninjalooters
---
I started playing end of Vanilla, mainly played BC-Wotlk. Back in the day I would play 6-10 hours everyday, easily.
---
These days, even when it is raining outside and I have nothing to do that day, I can't play longer than 4 hours straight.
---
Times have changed and I bet your buddy would not collapse anymore
---
I feel like intent is a big factor in things like this, no? The intent in both situations were the same. Proving intent in a situation like this is the hard part. 
---
But that doesn't mean the guy was in the right just because it's a "he said, she said" situation.
---
&gt;	my guild told me you stole my name
---
Or, you could‚Äôve just used ‚Äú/who Rojo‚Äù to figure out who had the name you wanted.
---
It's a good spot, i used it on pservs and now in classic.
---
Do you want to play as a tank? In that case.. Yes.  
---
Want to play as a healer? In that case.. No.
---
Ha-ha! :D Does it also give a bonus for healers though?
---
Can't wait to get to 60. Start asking for.money or items in exchange for my tanking just like on vanilla.
---
I apologize as well then
---
I tried all, mainly enhancement in early levels, but switched to ele at around 50, then to resto at 60.
---
Dont forget your Spirit Bond talent gets stronger by adding max. HP to your pet..
---
You‚Äôre not smart.
---
Fear ward is amazing but at the end of the day play what makes you happy
---
Nothing stupid about this... You made up a fairly elaborate game, that's cool, who cares what your materials were.
---
Including excelling at DPS. You're contradicting yourself. I don't know what point you're even making anymore.
---
Look. I get what you're saying. And the dude in this post is a dickhead. But there's nothing wrong with trying to be as efficient as possible, that's a fun, satisfying way to play for a lot of people.
---
Getting 100g in 2weeks post 40 is hardly unbelieveable, i got that as a rogue even
---
hc players would buy useful consumables with that money instead of hand of rag.
---
What do you think "Mage" part of "Mage-weave" implies? it's basically silk threads woven by a mage (Or magic user)
---
That actually looks really neat, size is perfect.
---
I always thought the same.
---
[*birdman handrub*](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-uDwKGxTFrADvO)
---
Hey, newbie here. Is this the so called Molten Core with Ragnaros as endboss? And is Rag the highest/Best endboss in classic?
---
did you cheese the boss? run him out to the room above with the 4 golems event
---
I mean, not really, because the time you save and extra bag slots you have available because you're dumping stuff on alts, far outweighs the 30c/stack mail fee.
---
It might seem like 30c/item can add up, but if you put it another way, you can send 1000 items for 3g, which at 60 is absolutely nothing.
---
Imo there are places to penny pinch, but penny pinching 30c/mail is going to actually cost you more money via lost time in the long run.
---
Assuming I can't charge, I don't have rage left, and I don't have bloodrage (which is a shitty combination, but happens):
---
- Mark Skull, preferably on a low damage mob.
---
- Gun pull in Def stance (bonus threat on initial threat)
---
- Zerker stance, berserker rage when first mob is almost there
---
- Def stance, target whatever target that is not skull.
---
Now I tab through the mobs, using the significant bonus rage from berserker rage. I can usually easily get all except skull, unless the healer is *really* over-eager or you have one of those stupid AoE bombers in your group that open up right when the first mob arrives. Talk to the first, kick the latter. Then, if skull isn't dead yet, I taunt that one. 
---
Like seriously, Berserker Rage is the magic that makes rage-starved range pulls manageable, it's so fucking amazing.
---
What bombs do you mean? And how do you get them
---
I'm glad you like arcanite reaper for looks / flavor / history I understand why you crafted it. With 1.12 stats they can get the sword   [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13348/demonshear](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13348/demonshear)  and 2 shot your buddies as well.
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
The problem with that argument (although I totally see your point) is that there simply wouldn't be any tanks doing dungeons other than Scholo. Also when they've done 3-4 MC's, they simply would never run a dungeon again.
---
Could be nice for me tho. I'd just respec prot and take payment for tanking.
---
Oh. Look another big guy part of the top 0.1% able to do this. 
---
Or more likely, someone that's not even 60 screaming their lungs out of ez this game is while not able to do the same himself.
---
Yes, this is a perfect example of what not to do. Attack the skull. That's why they're marked. Your tank is likely switching target every second on all the other mobs to solidify threat on them for the inevitable AoE spam that will be coming once skull is dead (or as is more likely, 0.1 sec after tank pulls).
---

---
That's always been difficult. Aside from only needing 2-3 tanks and only one MT, guilds also funnel gear and resources into their tanks - that TF is expensive, and warriors suck at farming so gotta buy elixirs for them. So a guild wants a tank they can really trust, preferably GM himself or a long time friend, otherwise there's a risk of the tank quitting or changing guild and then your guild just dies.
---
Tank roles for alot of guilds were already filled before character naming was a thing. 
---
And let's be honest here, unless you have a group of friends to play with, leveling a tank will be a night mare. 
---
That being said, most tanks will already have their groups premade for clearing dungeons and stuff. 
---
And from my experience so far. You don't want to tank for pugs in this game at all. The vast majority of the playerbase doesn't understand the threat mechanic, and wants to do an aoe spell cleave because they saw a streamer doing it. 
---
I havent had much trouble finding groups as a priest, but what I do have trouble finding are groups that aren't 3 mages and a warrior...
---
I don't even bother staying in those groups unless I know all 4 other people.
---
This is the bad side of having a game built around a community, shame it happened my friend.
---
Marginal threat *is* a thing, but it's not  relevant here. With such low threat/s and tanks at 1.3x generation it doesn't take much to take back. Let me be clear. I'm not ripping aggro in a single target scenario. What's happening is the initial pull is started, I dot primary target then begin to dot in the order the tank tab sunders. The problem comes when the tank, for whatever reason, doesn't continue to spread threat out across the pack so that the dots slowly take aggro.
---
nice
---
I recently started the game as a warrior and I've had a few dungeon runs as the tank so far. Is it usual business that the dps starts attacking as soon as I make a step in the general direction of trash? I have no rage, can't aoe tank and mobs are everywhere. It's extremely stressful. Will people change on higher levels?
---
I needed a 25g loan for my mount 2 weeks ago, I'm now 49 with 250g after repaying the loan. 40s make you way more money than the 30s
---
Damn, great achievement my man. What's the /played?
---
Is it possible to have my raid log reviewed? Is that a thing? Im a fresh 60 and only gotten a handful of good gear for my feral druid before my first raid, but it would be great to hear out how I can improve things in MC.
---
I've had my fair share of rude players like this, but most of the time players I meet in the wild or in dungeons are pretty cool. Only  lvl 32 yet so don't know about the higher levels. 
---
My main issue on Mograine is just the gnomes man. Always the gnomes.

---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Yes though the same... shit is, raiding is impossible with this...
---
lol @ all the potatoes in the responses saying hybrids are best because of a specific role in organized group PvP.
---
The average person does not care about organized group PvP. They'll probably never participate in a serious WSG premade. They didn't roll a druid to be a flag carrier.
---
World PvP, duels and non-organized battlegrounds is where 90% of the PvP will take place and being hard to kill won't help you there. When you're 1v1 in the world vs that warlock or shadowpriest, you're going to get fucked, you can be as hard to kill as you want.
---
You people have insanely slanted views of what matters in this game, because other than the very specific niches you mentioned here, hybrids are god awful, and will remain god awful for a pretty long time. Thankfully TBC does improve on a lot of these issues, so maybe then telling people not to play hybrid classes won't be good advice anymore!
---
You shouldnt need to respec before lvl 55-60 ish to heal or tank dungeons. 
---
Just keep a seperate set of healing / dps gear in your bank.
---
This is something not too many people think about.. time your IB exit with the autoattack animation of the mobs, wait for the majority of mobs to swing at you, THEN leave IB &gt; Nova :)
---
The best gold comes from being ahead of the curve.  Enchantments will drop in price when DM comes out - everyone's going to have your idea.
---
Being one of the first with an arcanite trans means you can charge 20g just for your cd.  Being one of the first with crusader means you can charge 50g with their mats.
---
The exact same as rolling any other 5 numbers
---
Well, I'm not minmaxing anything which could probably make it even better. I'm just mining everything I come across while doing quests and smelting into whatever is yellow and requires the least rescources. While enchanting in particular but also likely tailoring if you mean business with it, will be a net negative in income, mining and smithing is literally only income. Mine, smith and vendor what you make and you will have a very steady stream of income with no expenses a part from fluxes and stuff, which makes even more money.
---
Gl hf
---
Serious dickhead stuff here lol
---
selling stuff to a vendor is not as bad as it seems. you can probably make 25g+/h even when you are not a mage or hunter just by grinding and vendoring the drops.
---
making gold very much depends on your class and professions tough. a few guildies made thousands with herb or some super fast levelers took the great grindspots in epl way before the zone got populated. one of my guildies read up on the current ah marked and just played the ah with flipping items (he is currently the richest person i know with a cashstack of 5k+ and more than that sitting in his bank).
---
i personally just buy items that are bound to go up in price to resell or use in later phases, grinding vendor drops and calculate profitable crafts to sell.
---
pro tip: not alot of people like to fish and train cooking ;). try it, look through guides, droptables and test grindspots for them.
---
So hyped for the new show!
---
I have a 60 warrior and a 35 paladin on Judgement EU but the realm is super dead, 0 competition, 0 good guilds, nothing sells on AH so I made the decision to reroll. I know I probably have a slim chance of finding anyone at this point but here's hoping. Looking to reroll on any faction, any realm, only criteria is for the realm to be high pop. Thanks!
---
Shall put this to the test tonight
---
Hey what addon do you use for your chat and what addon allows you to move the classic unit frames?
---
\^this is a good attitude to have as a warrior.
---
I'm also a warrior myself, and although I'm fury and will be raiding as a pure dps, I've farmed pretty much all of my pre raid bis as a tank. 
---
I see groups looking for tanks for hours at a time, even if they already have a warrior in the group which is crazy to me. 
---
If you're a fresh 60 warr, sure tanking UBRS might not be an option if you're new at it, but you can easily tank everything else.
---
No, getting giant eggs will be a bit tough but you should be able to it. Otherwise just get them off of AH
---
Blizzard doesn't give a shit about anything posted outside of in game chat.  They won't do anything here.
---
SteamLink has been a godsend for my WoW cravings, it‚Äôs surprisingly smooth and easy to play!
---
Would Crusader on a WW axe be a good investment for an alt?
---
&gt;Combined this comes out to 25.8 points of threat
---
Per second, per mob.
---
Curse of Agony rank 3 comes in at level 28, which is actually nice for this example because I happened to ding level 28 on my tank warrior today.
---
&gt; A stray battle shout could keep ahead of that.
---
Battle Shout rank 3, which is what I'll have until level 32, adds 17 threat per party member who received a *fresh* buff. If we assume all 5 party members received a fresh buff, that's 110 (17 * 5 * 1.3) threat - or ~4.3 seconds worth of your two DoTs. It's a bad assumption to make however, so realistically we're looking at 44-66 threat for a completely fresh shout. If we use a macro like this:
---
```
---
/cancelaura battle shout
---
/cast battle shout
---
Spamming this we'd generate a whopping 14-15 threat/sec per mob, compared to your 25-26 threat/sec. So I have to disagree with the idea that your DoTs don't do a significant amount of threat.
---
A quick overview of my other abilities at this level (doesn't take into account 1.3x multiplier for being in Defensive Stance):
---
- Demoralizing Shout rank 2: 17 threat
---
- Sunder Armor rank 2: 140 threat
---
- Revenge rank 2: 195 threat
---
Had to do it yesterday in searing gorge. 60 rogue killing everyone that tried to go to incendiosaurus. Nobody came to help, even after 30+ min calling in chat. Got together with 2 other 50s in the area and in 2 min, after dying twice, he left
---
So just go the "premium" dps build for solo questing but having the preferred style of gear in your bank for when dungeon grinding become an option"
---
Not gonna lie, Grom'gol is a big reason I rolled horde.
---
Absolutely, sounds like a great idea.
---
Looted "Kang the Decapitator" should I try to sell now or wait? (PvE server)
---
Hmm... then it seems to me - and I might be wrong - but it just sorta seems like whichever one you pulled aggro on you shouldn‚Äôt have dotted.  That is my conclusion here.  Is this hard for you?  I feel like this isn‚Äôt hard and you‚Äôre making it out to be rocket science.
---
If a dps pulls aggro, the dps our TPS‚Äôd the tank.  The dps done fucked up.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs not hard.
---
Not to mention using a macro has the opposite effect.
---
Let me clarify my previous answer. There's a ton of skill involved in druid decision making (when to change forms and heal or cc, when to take your hits, when to swap weapons, etc), but not so much during the leveling process. Basically, when leveling, you'll assume cat form, kill 3 mobs, pop out and heal, then go back to cat. The only time skill is involved in leveling is when you pull too many and have to be crafty to live. While you're in bear or cat form, however, you only have like 2-3 buttons max that you'll press regularly, so the "rotation" is very simple and rather boring. If you manage to get geared enough to take a cat as a raid dps, that takes a ton of skill and consumables and form shifts to be competitive, so there's that. If you tank, you also have to gear appropriately and be creative with a lack of tank coolfowns. PvP has a crazy high skill ceiling since you mostly deal damage via DOTs against other players and try to Outlast/live them. I can't speak to raid druid healing, but I think it's similar to priest healing with fewer skills.
---
If you or a group mate kill vendor etc npc you get a dishonorable kill afaik that reduces your honor rank in Pvp a lot. This mechanic means you don‚Äôt want to group with people you don‚Äôt know (in case they kill a npc) and you don‚Äôt want to do a big city raid because of this (in aoe etc a lot of npc will die probably)
---
Thats multiboxing and totally fine to do.
---
There is no rogue spec that works in both pvp and pve.
---
Want to know this too!
---
Wintersaber rep grind, leveling alts to 35, doing dungeons for non-bis pieces (mainly high int/stam for PvP).
---
not really, players can easily leave said trash guild and this puts pressure on those to do so.
---
When a 5-man group is full of DPS that act like tards, healing gets *harder.*
---
When a 5-man group is full of DPS that act like tards, tanking gets ***super frustrating.***
---
With the current spellcleave/melee cleave/AOE twitch/streamer-spastic meta, most DPS players act like streamer-style hypertards 99% of the time.
---
Healing specs are universally useful in PvE and PvP (sure there are difference between optimal builds, but a PvE build can still do fine in PvP and vice versa). There's a good deal of overlap in  terms of gear as well.
---
Tank specs suck hard in PvP. Tanking gear is generally useless in PvP.
---
A healer can group up with a warrior / combat rogue / other melee to go powergrind (just yesterday I advertised "heals + WF totem, who wants to grind?" - 3 instant whispers).
---
A tank can go grind green mobs. Slowly.
---
Playing a tank just isn't really appealing, unless you have LOTS of time to dedicate to it, and a guild large enough to never have to tank for a pug.
---
Yes, and no, unless you start handpicking people you know. 
---
Best case you can expect is DPS opening on the mob as it arrives. If a DPS feels like he wants to pull or shoot at stuff that I have not reached yet, I'll tell him to hold back or I'll find a new one, that's my red line. If a mage starts AoE-ing too early and draws threat on everything, I expect him to be able to manage that or he dies.
---
This is a outstanding move, but kinda normal in wow. The reason i am on a PvE Server.
---
*My dad works for Blizz bro, be nice to me or I'll get you banned!*
---
yes, but not Battlegrounds, they come in phase 3
---
people need to leave these shitty trash guilds asap.
---
Greatest reaction ever
---
some people dont even know what ninja really is
---
1 salty roll loser in an influencial guild is enough to get you in a lot of trouble for nothing
---
You know anyone that you secretly consider to be really dumb?  
---
    
---
That's what they're like.
---
With that levels if arrogance, you don't have to do much to aggro everyone and everything withing a 5 mile distance
---
Hit% is extremely valuable for Warlock, as only Affliction can gain bonus. I would keep it.
---
Wait until Bloodvine
---
Be careful. Steam link is against the ToS. I asked Blizz support this question last week and the responded saying that Steak Link is against their ToS.
---
Neat I didnt know that I felt like I was a horrible healer because I ran out of mana after 6 or 7 heals but maybe I just need to read a guide to see how its properly done
---
You guys just have so many members! lol
---
Good news with the fights druids cant MT is most of them either have need for high threat OT or the ability to pick up adds quickly (druids are good at both) or are healing/decurse intensive and the druid can provide extra support
---
Class is also insanely fun, you have tools for just about anything
---
I killed him once..
---
if you are in a guild you could ask your class leader or raid lead to take a look.
---
you could also compare yourself with your competitors. raidlogs are an incredibly powerful tool:
---
find someone who did better than you.
---
try to find differences: better gear/ different specs. if hes similar to you proceed to look into it.
---
what rotation does he us at a certain boss.
---
what consumes does he use etc.
---
And Kurinnaxx official Reddit server or what? Bahahahah
---
I got one guy three boats in a row. He ended up hearthing.
---
Alright, i'll try to communicate more. Just afraid of peoples impatience
---
Glad to see so many Kurinnaxxians in the house lol
---
Depends on who you meet, I met a great group of experienced players and we instantly hit it off so I kinda stuck with them. They did outlevel me because I took a break but now I'm at a point where I can finally do endgame dungeons with them and it's been an amazing experience
---
Afaik this is correct.
---
This at least sounds fun to watch to be honest :p
---
The average to smart mage will blink after charge. If he tries to sheep after blink, intercept stun will counter sheep. Pummel the next sheep try. Mage should be dead by third try.
---
You won't make shit for a few more months. Stockpile and fill a couple toons bank with squid
---
right? everyone jumping ship to hate the GM but what if OP just got into his first raid with the guild? what if he respec just for that raid but he's actually resto? idk there are a lot of variables.
---
If you really like dungeons I would say warrior is a great choice to level. I would choose to level as arms as it is a decent spec for tanking dungeons (tactical mastery talent is a must)
---
So why did you go shadow at all?
---
I'd say craft Truefaith if you're willing to then drop it if you aren't enjoying it anymore.
---
Because it's not worth the effort to keep track of. Sure there are runs where you will win none, but you'll build up a huge bank anyway. I already have about 80 of them.
---
Am enchanter. I overwrite my own enchants all the time. Sometimes enchanting the same piece of armor over and over just to get the proffession points.
---
This is a coffee break fix that they've ignored for 15 years. #NoChanges #IndieCompany
---
Dueling is probably the easiest/best way to learn but it's still a lot different than World PvP. Combine it with watching some PvP videos of your own class and perhaps the class you have the hardest time with to figure out what's annoying or countering them.
---
Cheating with FAP and LIP potions will win you most World PvP duels, engineering is the cherry on top.
---
Something which I did but wouldn't suggest because it's so time consuming is leveling alts if you don't know the skillset and limitations of other classes. There's enough good pvp videos out there now so you can pretty much learn the class from that.
---
\^this.   
---
I was MT back in the day and the hardest part was not the tanking.   
---
The hardest part was to keep everyone in check to not increase the pace on their own.  
---
This and actually communicating with people.
---
there will always be impatient and rude people.
---
also dont be shy to ask for directions if you havent been to a dungeon before.
---
tldr: open communication :)
---
I find it pretty hilarious when people are stressing about having optimal specs for raiding when guilds were clearing raids with groups that weren't even all level 60 or geared on like the second week
---
This exactly, if they are not posted in a public chat (via blizzard like trade chat/party) nothing can be done.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs on an iPhone. Apparently it‚Äôs against ToS to use though, but I don‚Äôt see how they could detect it.
---
Why 35?
---
explain
---
Preparing for the next patch.
---
It‚Äôs not possible to have 2 enchantments on 1 item right?
---
I did the cooking one on level 35. Just buy off the ingredients from the AH (except for the cheese - go to a regular vendor for it). Both the Giant Eggs and the Clam meat were sold an nearly vendor price on my server.
---
I pretty much just slide out that /ignore command the moment you realize they're 12 years old.
---
I'm fully aware of that but was looking to understand how the numbers work for myself. 
---
Based on what /u/masterblaster0 linked to me I can now see what I need to know.
---
Default: 35% glancing penalty, 9% hit cap
---
With orc passive weapon skill: 15% glancing penalty, 6% hit cap
---
With edgemasters: 7% glancing penalty, 5.8% hit cap
---
With edgemasters ADN orc passive weapon skill: 5% glancing penalty, 5.3% hit cap
---
So from this I can conclude that just because you are orc / human and have passive weapon skill, does not mean that you shouldn't get a weapon skill item like Edgemasters. Even with your racial passive weapon skill you still suffer 15% glancing blow penalty, which you can reduce to 5% with some more weapon skill.
---
Flash of Light + Illumination (talent). 
---
The mana efficiency is incredible. Holy Light will burn through your mana very quickly but it's also extremely strong so try to use it sparingly. 
---
The best tip I can give is to learn about mana regen and triage. Simply summarised you need to not cast for 5 seconds to start mana regeneration so casting as infrequently as possible is important. This is where triage comes in, if a DPS is at 2/3 health then he doesn't need to be healed unless there is damage coming - a DPS at 1 health might as well be a DPS at full health if he isn't being attacked or standing in fire. If you use triage well you won't have to cast as much and so you'll have more mana to help you heal the tank.

I bought a Acer nitro 5 earlier this year. They're are cheaper versions. But it runs like a dream.

SteamLink is basically remote play for steam but can be used to remote control your PC and have some cool control overlays. It works surprisingly well, just look in your App Store :)
---
If you don't agree on rules, there are no rules. Those who complain afterwards will always find a reason why it's not their own fault they lost.
---
&gt; Hmm... then it seems to me - and I might be wrong - but it just sorta seems like whichever one you pulled aggro on you shouldn‚Äôt have dotted.
---
*Again*: threat management isn't an issue if the tank also knows what he is doing. If the tank tab sunders at the beginning *and continuously* through the fight, dotspread and small scale AoE like a cone of cold every 10 to 15s should not be an issue.
---
If your mage blasts Flamestrike into AE into Cone of Cold and then Blizzard for three crits, then that is obviously the mages fault.
---
But if you are tanking three mobs and one cone of cold or a dotspread 30 seconds into the fight loses your aggro on two of them, then you're not holding up your end of the threat generation.
---
I get whispers like this all the time to fill spellcleaves and it's so annoying
---
Using potions is totally OK.
---
He's clearly saying that it doesn't work for specifically him, probably due to some addon
---
I've been buying all going under 15s, and there's still quite a lot to buy. I'm too much of a cheapskate to use them yet though.
---
Blessing of Protection = big ol you can‚Äôt die button
---
Druid.   Skinning/Enchanting.   Skinning is crap, and enchanting is a money sink
---
I mean, that was kind of the reasoning Blizz used to streamline all the classes "People only ever use these specific builds, so why bother having anything that isn't cookie-cutter?"
---
Phase two is going to Bea shit show of world PvP and guilds will fall apart and people will server transfer and the drama that will ensure. 
---
All the fuckhead streamers are going to be spammmmmming YouTube with videos and the sort. 
---
It will be a mess that will cut the playerbase in half haha. 
---
Expect like April - may for phase 3. Phase 2 will probably start off during the holiday season. Although phase 2 should really wait until at least Feb. 
---
But blizzard knows best. I imagine they will release content with how the playerbase is scaling.
---
It was a long time ago, obviously. But I leveled a priest back in the day and it was very boring. Druid doesn't seem to be a pick at end game but it has a good toll kit if you just want to enjoy the journey. That would be my choice.
---
I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs him trying to justify giving it to himself. ‚ÄúSince there aren‚Äôt many dedicated shaman besides this ONE guy with us. Imma just take it for myself.‚Äù
---
You're welcome friend
---
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll make sure to not post any more detail to link to my account specifically. I don‚Äôt see how they could detect this though, I guess just don‚Äôt steam you playing it lol
---
It‚Äôs called boycotting, and it works for a reason.
---
God this movie was a masterpiece
---
eu dreadmist horde, im playing a priest and so far while leveling (im lvl 36) its been pretty difficult finding dungeon groups because theres tons of healers in every zone LFG for the dungeon already
---
&gt; If everyone has more gold everything will cost less hence gold is less worth.
---
Yes, ty.
---
Very very low drop rate. Plus mages making robes out of them.
---
It can be decent for a quick 1v1, but playing without stealth talents and improved sap feels awful.
---
It took me a fair bit of tweaking to get right but it was well worth it!
---
Yea, droprate of all essences are fcked up. Maybe it has something to do with phase 1, like they will increase droprates in later phases?
---
if i folllow your logic i can just need on everything.
---
i need money, bop sells to vendors, i hit need
---
why should i let someone equip an item when i need the gold? they can go out and buy one of those boes.
---
statistical speaking you get a lot more gold from needing bop items than the occasional boe.
---
those need on boe is indeed an regional US approach. haven't seen it once on EU realms. not in vanilla and not now
---
Aye, too bad use have no cohesiveness in how you do it. Letting some memes stay and others banned, while allowing the same text posts being reposted daily. This sub would be better if it had no moderation considering how fucking retarded the mods are, I'd rather have no horde tatto posts, or vaguely wow themed food posts not appear, but i'd take them over the mods removing funny content because they flipped a coin and got heads.
---
Don't trade accounts... Terrible idea
---
Bump. Same question. Killed eles for multiple hours not a single essence. Not sure about bad rng on my side.
---
Trade what you didn't even specify
---
No
---
it works just fine but you had to go for lowest number wins.
---
And dw tank only just out threat them, meanwhile these druids take less damage
---
I love how being called Swedish has become the ultimate insult
---
I just did this yesterday with an STV elite mob. Stood in stealth next to the spawn till another player fpught it to 50% HP. Ganked him and stole the kill. I felt bad but also very excited. :D
---
I started a lil late so I'm just at 25 but as an ally rogue on Skeram I'm having a lot of fun. 
---
I'm liking how many horde there are to kill compared to not finding anyone at all on retail.
---
I can definitely see how it'd be awful for any non stealth class though.
---
The horde I've encountered have all been easy to kill but they're extremely petty. 
---
I'll kill someone my level once and then they'll call a lvl 60 over to camp me. Like calm down lmao.
---
Also yesterday me and my friend 2v4d a group (all within 2 levels of us) and then they got like 4 more people in the area to come over and help them.
---
Seems like most of these guys don't actually want to PvP, they want to pve with bodyguards üòÇ

Okay thanks. So I got that question answered! What about removing an enchant? Possible too?
---
Ty!
---
PvP
---
In my experience you gotta play fast as a warrior in order to get the control you want. The DPS has to 'feel' like they are 'behind' constantly. 
---
Would also recommend leveling with tactical mastery to utilize the rage from charge for that burst rage.

Hold on, I was in the same boat. On launch, installed it on my 2010 MBP only to have it not be able to start...some error with OpenGL (can't remember specifics). 
---
Did some googleing and that apparantly happens because classic is built using the modern client, which no longer supports pre 2013 MBP graphic accelerators.
---
So you can‚Äôt disenchant once you‚Äôve enchanted but you CAN replace the enchantment?
---
Depends on the group. And depends on the people. Talk about it before you start. And then you know.

But like if a 400g bis purple drops. I don't give a fuck if you are in greens, I am need rolling on it.

Unfortunately no. But you can 3 man it pretty easily especially if you have preraid bis / raid gear.

This post is sad attempt of the moochers to convince players to lend them money. :-D

Out of all the people I lent money in WoW 90% never return it. And it makes sense. If you are that bad with money that you can't afford a mount how are you suddenly after that gonna be good with money to repay your debt lel.

Yours was literally just a screenshot with words.
---
This one compares Mageweave and silk on a R&amp;M background.
---
potions are absurdly powerful. also very expensive.
---
optimal play with alchemy costs at least 100g+/h.
---
since duels are intended to be (competitive AND) fun, the generals census is that potions are bm.
---
think of a duel as a competition between your mastery of your class/ character. not a measurement of how much gold you can waste in the smallest possible timeframe.
---
most other professions have way less investment involved or are one time costs. alchemy is one time use only
---
Yeah I'm just saying it just looks different than what I've experienced.
---
i mean in pvp it's arguably even more important. Giving your mages fear ward so they can blink in and sapper charge and arcane explosion without being cced
---
Ah, I was seeing it as "You can't report people just by what they say in chat" or something along those lines.
---
Anything specific? like farming something that you are gonna need, or just making gold or ?
---
I am at level 17 and still doing quests in Darkshore, but I‚Äôve never been to Stormwind so I said screw it and went on a journey to get there cause there was no way of fast travel. It was a really good adventure and explored lost of new places on my way. I finally arrived to Stormwind and it is an amazing place, love design! There are some quests too for low level characters as well so I am going to stay there for a while!
---
I mean, let‚Äôs be real, the reason I was being so facetious is because the situation the above poster presented was so ludicrous.  The healer out TPS‚Äôs pure dots, so the tank would HAVE to be generating more threat than the dots on all targets anyway.  The above poster is leaving out something from the story.  It is easy for a warlock to pull aggro.  It is not easy for it to be just from dots, unless it‚Äôs the beginning of the pull.  If you‚Äôre sitting shit up and the warrior has zero rage, gg.  If the tank is generating less threat than your dots and the fight has gone on for any reasonable amount of time, the mob is t coming for the warlock, it‚Äôs coming for the healer.
---
You shouldn't really be having any issues on princess. I don't mean to sound elitist but the fight really isn't that complicated. Dodge dart cloud and have healer stand far away at all times. That's all there really is to it
---
when you level a frost mage you dont buy fireblast past rank 1
---
Minimum level to get artisan professions.
---
People will use it for Arcanite transmute, mooncloth etc.
---
Okay gotcha. Just wanted to make sure
---
but all sources I've checked say over 20% drop rate
---
Disenchanting destroy the item
---
For Artisan profession level. I just plant them and log in once every 4 days to use my crafting CD.
---
You can overwrite the enchantment with another one or a weapon chain. Disenchantment will destroy the weapon producing enchanting materials.
---
The drop rate is low, it's just random how you do.
---
Best I've had is 9 in 30 minutes.
---
Worst is 1 in 5 hours across three days.
---
It's usually heavily contested too, and feels like it drops less for me with more people around (tinfoil hat)
---
Your DPS shouldn't really have to give you time to build threat on princess
---
Your character has to be level 35 in order to train professions to 300.
---
This is what got me started, it has some good tips [link](https://youtu.be/HTNPoBUYuXI)

i got 2 in about 20 minutes of farming there it's called RANDOM for a reason
---
No, not really. Still worse DPS(+1.05% crit is not worth 17 SP even in a fire spec.), and mostly worse in PvP, too. 100 HP + 45 mana +10 Spirit(160 mana on Evocate) + 6 armor vs 500 mana + ~1% more damage. Geez.

Reality is different. Not sure if bug or intended. Also old drop data may not be so accurate.
---
on google.  
---
and the search function here gives you alot of info, because this is asked atleast one a week.
---
Okay I understand. Thanks for the help :)
---
Whoever tells you not to use a potion in a duel is a sook - use whatever advantage you have to win.
---
That chestpiece is great for those of us who don't want to farm or even wear that awful turquoise prom dress. Super cheap to make, usually sells well over the cost.
---
AOE grinding is only going to work against minimum level green mobs, and you're going to need to use Seal of Wisdom to keep it going. Caster and ranged mobs will be super annoying to deal with. It's a situational kind of thing.
---
If you want to keep tanking/healing 5-mans and want to keep the spec, your best bet in most situations probably is to single target with SoRrighteousness and keep JoWisdom on targets. Slow, but low downtime.
---
Ret is a good deal better for levelling. You get a pretty good increase in single target damage, and it costs almost 0 mana to deal that damage - so you use your mana to heal up, and let spirit regen do some work. Faster killing, less downtime. You do have the annoying dilemma, though ... 11 holy first or not. 11 holy makes 5-man healing easier (70% pushback resistance) and gives you consecration - but it delays the ret tree.

The two circumstances are different.

BUALS

but 0 in over 100 is not 20% thats why I'm asking

At least mages don't roll on everything... (Except that mage who rolled on the VC sword)
---
WST / WeaponSwingTimer
---
When it comes to green equipment, at least, I'd say need when need. They are rarely worth much anyway.
---
I guess if valuable recipes or unique blue BoEs, then it gets a bit more fuzzy. At that point, I'd probably say it makes sense that either everyone greeds or everyone needs (basically making it a greed, but ninja-proof).

I would say to make a troll holy priest since you have a rogue.
---
Priest can fill your pve itch and rogue your pvp.

I would also recommend getting herb as a profession and to level cooking on the priest so you can make tea for your rogue 
---
Main tank with a 2 hand sounds kinda sketchy. Bet he wants the Windseeker bindings too. Scum gm.

He is not paying respect to UnderCity...

To be honest I didn't notice huge increase in dps. I was using Trash blade and mirah's song before.

I thought sharia prohibits riba, or usury =)

Until 4 horsemen that is. Back in vanilla most dps warriors in fact tanked when doing 5mans. Hybrid builds were a thing, and once you add a few tanking pieces from raids you can easily tank dungeons with a pure dps spec.

Use game mode in windows to disable those key functions, or use something like Razer synapse to remap functions.

I keep my fkeys set to raid groups for healing purposes, but lots of stuff that you can in theory do

I‚Äôm fine with DPS warriors.

When I‚Äôm on my priest, I‚Äôm happy because they do a lot of damage. 
---
When I‚Äôm on my warrior, I just don‚Äôt invite them because I don‚Äôt want the loot competition. 
---
I‚Äôd never shit on someone for wanting to play something they want to play.
---
not really, he said it to the helms conn or first officer, usually data and riker
---
The best way to keep aggro on eager dps is to pull before they are ready, but then you are rushing your healer sometimes and now they are mad at you.
---
Zandalar Tribe is also recommended. Lots of Ally. STV is a PVP war zone as always, the rest of the contested places are pretty chill.

Druid vs. Priest was the decision I was faced with for choosing my main.
---
I eventually picked druid for the following reasons:
---
- capability to stealth is extremely usefull in Open-World-PvP
---
- travel form to break snares and get away in all sorts of PvP
---
- I can tank 5-man-dungeons which is tremendously helpful for gearing up in the leveling- phase and when it comes to farming stuff in them becuase you'll find groups much more quickly
---
One thing that I learned was a misjudgement I had from before was the usefullness of Omen of Clarity for Healing.
---
Early on it was super-great and I could use it all the time to go from mob-group to mob-group mostly healing for 0 mana with my Omen-Proccs.
---
But at Maraudon and BRD the amount of heals cast from Omen-Proccs have gone down tremendously. AoE-Silence, AoE-Stuns, Interrupts, AoE-Damage and simply much more damage in general require to comit to healing from afar reducing the opportunities to try and get Omen-Proccs to almost nothing.
---
There's also things I didn't consider that much initially but that I really learned to love about druids and would really miss when playing priest.
---
Thorns: Whether I heal, tank or DPS. Putting those on the tank is such a helpfull thing for the tank to keep aggro and the passive damage adds up a lot. Since I had Omen anyways I also got +75% more Thorn-Damage right there. When in Bear and tanking large groups they are a significant part of my damage and play a big role in the healer not getting aggro. Which is also true when I heal.
---
Innervate: It basically refills 2/3rd of a Mana bar of either myself or a healer. In some encounters it can even be used while tanking. The cooldown is also reasonably short. It has saved the day on quite a few occassions.
---
I been in the same boat, but did you tell them that you Will leave? Or just left out of the blue?
---
&gt; he is right about it was not like that
---
Except he's not. Go ahead, Google it.
---
Hello,
---
Looking to roll a Tauren Druid, I think Kodos are ugly as sin and Wolves are best mount, would it be worth me running to the Orc starting zone so I could get that Orgrimmar XP from the early quests? Or can I go back and pick them up later?
---
I'd be looking to be exalted by the time I hit 40. Time efficiency isn't an issue, if it's possible to go back and do grey quests for rep (Don't know if that works?) I will happily.
---
I see what u mean, and im thankful for the information!
---
I just checked out an detailed bis-list and can link it this evening if you like, where this is included (it seems). 
---
From this information I assumed that they calculated with Edgemasters (which IS a great item) and the gauntlets of mc. They had two sections: human/orc (divided by weapons ofc) and other races. 
---
Therefore the hit with 6% as human/orc and 9% seems familiar.
---
Did you forget about 50% of a hunters damage? ... That little pet thing that stops you from stealthing ? Lol
---
people are not playing on 2005 computers anymore and will attack your pet to put you in combat when you feign.
---
You should scatter before you attempt to trap
---
Got me wondering. Can I disenchant another players item if they place it in the "do not trade" window?
---
Grind out elementals in arathi/badlands. 
---
Elemental earth, and fire sell extremely well right now. 
---
As well as selling stacks of charms for the warrior quest is lucrative.
---
Otherwise Stone elementals drops tons of vendor trash that stacks well.
---
As I said I see your point but needing for AH can also be seen as greed. As needing say a prostetic leg for walking and you want/greed it because someone who needs it might pay money for it.
---
This might be an unfair comparison, but it gets the point across.

---
Yeah, I always wait for my healer if they sit down. Me being stupid results in some very unlucky pulls and I'd like them to have full mana then üòÖ
---
RNGesus should bless his faithful followers instead of rewarding heathens.
---
Sorry but this is just not true, you're just playing with terrible players or are incredibly unlucky. This is not the norm.
---
You also need to put pet passive in the macro. When you want to use the macro, spam it like crazy as it doesn't always work with a single click.
---
It's certainly not 100% reliable though.
---
When I was leveling I pretty much was down for anything that gave XP of sorts. I usually don't volunteer for dungeons if I don't have about 2x the normal dungeon time available.
---
Well.. I didn't "just kick him", I said I asked him to stop 3 times before doing it. He had the chance to play along with the rest of the group and didn't, so he was being the rude one.
---
Fwiw, I kicked him for two main reasons: he could cause a wipe later, and wipe or not, he's slowing things down and making my job, and the healers, much harder regardless. When you grab aggro on a pull, it means the warrior can't build rage from being hit by those mobs, which makes it much harder to grab aggro back when you need to. If the healer is too slow or the mage gets hit too hard, he dies and the aggro transfers to the 2nd highest. Usually in that case it's healer because the tank doesn't have the rage or abilities to keep up with that kind of AoE. Then the tank has to scramble to get aggro back, use cooldowns etc, and then we waste time ressing, rebuffing and drinking.
---
It also means that the healer has to use much more mana (healing the mage + the tank) which means drinking more, and it means the mage has to drink after every pull too (when single target means you can go 3-4+ pulls without a drink if you manage your dps properly). And finally, if there's only one mage doing any serious AoE, the mobs won't die before they're oom. Which means they're still attacking people, still costing the healer mana to heal their damage, while the mage is stood there wanding and the rest of the dps focus them down one at a time anyway.
---
There's plenty of videos of it by now, it costs 1 invis potion per run.
---
On the priest.
---
1) pretty easy to level and you can heal dungeons whilst shadow spec.  Ideally you want two gear sets, +spirit for grinding and in shadow and +int gear for healing.
---
2) Spriests were great in early wow PvP, you have a huge tool kit!
---
3) On raiding depends on your guild, let's be honest, we over aggro and are hugely mana inefficient, long fights we are gonna be oom very quickly.  Our one saving grace is that if your guild has a lot of locks, then us Spriests can get a spot for the +shw rebuff we have.  But your individual DPS contribution will be meh.  I think there are some extreme builds that allow for the debuff and to do some healing.  Again your healing output suffers.  So it's all down to your guild, have a chat with your GM / class leader.
---
Fwiw, in my guild I do have the backup spriest raid slot, though I haven't finished the 60 grind just yet
---
#ScreamingBeforeRollingGotFixed
---
Blizz is fast on those hotfixes
---
Better than useless scorpid debuff that never stacks to 5, waste of focus.
---
Mind control your gorilla, pull all trash mobs, clap, volley, gg. Easy farm in DM.
---
Would you say the same for BOP items?
---
quite a bit, but it's also ~12s each on my server right now. not really a great motivator for picking up herbalism.
---
Don't listen to people telling you sit on it, they are economy noobs.
---
Gold is worth 10x more now than it will be in a year when bg's come out, if you're even playing still. So even if you sit on it and sell it for double, you are still losing out big time.
---
It‚Äôs fine. I did the same. Say sorry and leave it‚Äôs ok imo if they advertise it wrong
---
yeah I would have left as soon as I realised nobody had the key
---
Sir Ian McKellen wasnt in Star Trek...
---
Criticizing our lord is not the behaviour of a "faithful follower" 
---
Repent and amend, brother
---
Not a bit, a lot.
---
This went from a "oh, what a nice gesture" post to "what a f\*cking scumbag" really fast. Not saying that he needed to pay the guy something for this, but the need to lie about it really makes it trashy.
---
That is another system where the need depends on the value of the item.
---
Ty sir
---
\+1 for Zandalar
---
It fits every requirement he just listed. It was pretty balanced at first but it's minorly Ally leaning now. Great faction rivalry
---
I used to farm them in Vanilla, there is no way those drop figures are correct. The drop rate on them is very low.
---
Lmao that's kinda sad.
---
Done.
---
or just an owl or carrion bird with spammable aoe lmao
---
Shadow Priest and Rogue sounds suitable for you.
---
To be honest it's not really worth it. It's better to specialize. If you specc into swords, and you equip a dagger to ambush someone - it won't be very powerful as you don't have the right talents for it.
---
When I first went UG a few weeks ago it was bliss.  Wild pathing Devilsaurs all over.  I got in a few good farm sessions before it gradually got busier.  At first it was just competition for the tag, and people respected your tags and allowed you to loot. Now however it is literal hell.  Some dipshit streamer/youtuber did a video about sniping skins, so now, at least half the tags you get end up being sniped by either friendly or enemy rogue. Now I can deal with enemy faction snipes, I have done my fair share of killing Alliance who have tagged a 'Saur, but being fucked over by your own faction members sucks.
---
Just have to get a feel for each healer and dps you play with. If you see your healer running close to the next pull while you're doing the previous pull and immediately starts drinking, you can usually pull when they are at 70% mana because they are showing you they are ready to go. Most important thing is to let combat drop for at least a second so they can start a drink before next pull.
---
I agree since there is a price limit the lines are not clear. Then it's just how much money are you willing to take away something from someone.
---
Yeah, the 0,01% of the times as a shaman it actually procced like that with enough crits to give you an instant boner. The other times you are just that guy that gets instantly focused thanks to your big glow dick.
---
I know I have sinned. But the Lord makes it truly hard to stay faithful with these tests..
---
&gt; Gold feels weird in Classic.
---
Doesn't Classic feel weird in general if you are spamming dungeons to level? Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to belittle the playstyle, but for me it would be the same as playing Diablo (or another action-RPG).
---
Honestly, fury warriors are a plague in classic. Not only are they making the tanking pool smaller, they make it hard for the already hardest class (rogue) to gear and find groups because leather is mostly their BIS.
---
Like yeh cool, you don‚Äôt want to tank. But we have literally been looking for a tank for 2 hours and the group is about to disband cause there‚Äôs 3 other groups in trade chat looking for a tank for the same instance.
---
Hahaha. Salt I love it. 
---
People like this make me smile haha. Just knowing that things in a video game make these people so upset is actually quite hillarious. 
---
But my laughing at you for being weak willed aside. 
---
Most guilds have a blacklist. Most community servers won't have one because it's pretty much whichhunting on a he said she said basis. All those lists do is cause a causality loop between stupid people, and drama.
---
No shit, I'm sitting at like 55g at level 47. I get in new and don't know how to properly grind it out or whatever, but tailoring/enchanting has had me broke as a joke the entire time up
---
Not really, there's nothing there for priests at least. Just Reed trinket and maybe boots from Rend.
---
I run it on. Microsoft surface Pro 4 basic settings..
---
It does kick up a fuss and gets warm but it is playable for questing and some instances but nothing further.
---
If recommend at decent processers, an SSD and a dedicated gfx chip at a minimum if you were wanting to do more than just levelling.
---
Every day when I log in now, the first thing I do is pay some random mage a gold for 80 level 45 waters. It makes grinding so much faster on a shadow priest being able to spam water like that.
---
An Arena , Anger , Golem run Takes Like what 45-60 minutes. Tops? I did the full run before and it took us like 2-3 hours with everyone getting their Quest.
---
I usually mark skull before attacking and tell the dps to focus on that. One of the DPS will tank it and that gives me time to get aggro on the other mobs. On single targets (except bosses) i don't even try to tank and just go dps.
---
I'm in a relatively casual guild actually. Almost all classic raid bosses don't have hard mechanics, they are extremely simple. People are generally better players now than in Vanilla. I cant imagine any current 40 man raid not clearing MC in 2-3 evenings on their first try if they read up on the fights and have threat meters.
---
Don‚Äôt trust online drop rates
---
I may be wrong but I think it‚Äôs impossible to be exalted by 40. 
---
Also if you‚Äôre a Druid there won‚Äôt be any Druid trainers in the Orc starting zone meaning you won‚Äôt be able to train or do class quests without the big time dump of running to and from the nearest trainer
---
That's single target dmg, not aoe. Doesn't matter if your enemies have lowered dmg. You'll get dazed anyway.
---
Whatever source you‚Äôre looking at is not a reputable one.
---
The piccolo isn‚Äôt a bug they changed it at some point I‚Äôm like 99% sure
---
For Rogue BIS on Wowhead it says that the Wyrmhide Spaulders are a good alternative option but it only grants 2% hit and nothing else. Is it really better than shoulders that gives a large amount of agi?
---
BRD "save the princess"
---
Some will. There will always be people like them though.
---
I do have some tips to help though. First, get Anger Management in the Arms tree, as well as +parry and the talent which gives you rage retention when changing stances. Before I go on, Anger Management has a hidden effect not in the tooltip - it generates 1 rage every 3 seconds whilst in combat (**take this talent**). The other main talent here, the one which lets you keep rage when you change stances, is very useful; early on you can use the following macro to give you a little extra starting rage with Charge. 
---
___
---
^((Remove the brackets around the #)^)
---
***For battle stance use this macro:***
---
(#)showtooltip 
---
/castsequence reset=nocombat Charge, Defensive Stance.
---
____
---
***For defensive stance use this macro in substitute of the first:***
---
(#)showtooltip Charge
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
With these two macros you can easily swap between stances and use Charge to open fights all in one button. You can then use the rage you get early on from this to use Demoralising Roar. Demoralising Roar is one of two ways to generate AoE aggro the other being Battle Shout - although neither generate a ton of aggro, it helps though.
---
if you want another factions mount, doing the starter zone while its level appropriate is the best way to do it.(ie, starting at level1)
---
i think as a tauren you have some restriction to that though. i think tauren cant ride every mount since they are "too big/ heavy" for them. not 100% sure about that, youll have to look it up/ wait for another comment to enlighten us about that.
---
That's why it is called faith. It is hard, illogical and sometimes even downright infuriating, but we are all his --slaves-- servants
---
I saw an alliance druid dying to a croc so I thought I'd help out and gouge the croc while he got his heal off. He repaid me with a faerie fire and tried to kill me? I spent the next hour following them and making sure they did their quests as ineffeciantly as possible
---
That's... not accurate. Why on earth would you not want a long range, fairly cheap, instant cast that hits reasonably hard and benefits from ele penetration and shatter?
---
I left after the wipe telling them its not as advertised  as well as letting them know before that im not here for questing or others Bosses.
---
You must be playing a different game.. that doesn‚Äôt happen

Whats the name of the addon that shows debuffs abot the nameplates? :)
---
Yeah, I've learned to mark at least skull and X by now but your suggestion to actually ignore skull makes kind of sense. It's getting whaled down anyway, better focus on the remaining mobs, thanks
---
Your a bit of a dick
---
It's BiS for the rich twinks @ lvl 39 so theres that.
---
I often refuse grouping when the target is humanoids cause i need my cloth for tailoring skillups. I've told people that and they've offered to give me the cloth that drops so i didnt mind joining forces.
---
Tauren can ride Kodo and Wolves, (Lucky me)
---
Well played
---
This is how you find the players who have a deep understanding of their class, and these are the ones you want on your raid team and or in your battle ground.
---
Yeah but SteamLink isn‚Äôt a stand alone program as far as I am aware, it‚Äôs built directly into Steam so I don‚Äôt think that will ever happen ü§û
---
Then i dont see you doing anything wrong, some groups are like that, other are amazing
---
FYI, you do not need to open the chest, just move up to the platform so the boss aggro's.
---
Drop data is from an addon so it may not be 100% accurate and doesn't account for patch number.

And to trigger WoWhead lets check [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7082](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7082)

* [Whirling Invader](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=14455) has 12%
---
* [Cyclone Warrior](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=11745) has 11%
---
* [Dust Stormer](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=11744) has 7% (and this is the usually farmed one)
---
Going to the dark side of Azeroth we have [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7082](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7082) which lists 7%, 7%, 4% respectively.
---
It still creates more aggro than 100 damage every minute
---
Wait, somebody actually pays for that?
---
Currently rewatching this as we speak. October 11th bitch!
---
crit also applies to Hunter ranged DPS.
---
I'd debate exalted isn't impossible, as a lot of the early quests give 100-150 Rep for Org. 
---
Your point about the lack of Druid trainers is the real kicker though, in that regard do you still get full rep if you go back and do grey quests? Do grey quests stop appearing after a certain level threshold?
---
Blood rage is a 1 min CD.
---
Yes, hit is amazing in regards of damage! :)
---
If you advertise "no fee, tips welcome", you're not allowed to be angry when someone tips you &lt;insert any number here&gt;g
---
Mage and Hunter require very little effort to play effectively.
---
It triggers me so much when people talk shit when they have others on ignore. It's so goddamn dishonorable and craven.
---
Much appreciated! The charge in battle stance and then switching to def I already did but I always used rend... Stupid me, I'll do the shout instead now üòÖ
---
Your AP and Crit don't really work if you miss the enemy. Hit Cap &gt; All.
---
I think using a macro is allowed. To automate is it‚Äôs not. Maybe check how to write a macro to buy the bag to have a chance. Not sure if it‚Äôs possible otherwise without a lot of luck.
---
Hit percentage makes sense once you think about it. How much damage do you lose with a single missed hit? I dont know what a typical rogue damage tick looks like but lets just say 500. How much agi would you really need to compensate for the 500 damage? Quite a bit
---
Nelf druid. Vagina confirmed
---
I've seen some names that I'm certain would be forced to change if anyone had reported them.
---
One that stands out (for obvious reasons) was the human rogue "Assblast".
---
You're* and yes I am
---
What the fuck with the comments in here.
---
I'll find you. And I'll kill you.
---
I used Rend too when I first started - it just seemed to make sense.
---
Gee you mean like bop items? And these are boe? And I wonder then why all these noobs keep acting like boe is treated the same as bop just because they can ‚Äúequip it‚Äù
---
Wondering why players of a game that has a (for today‚Äôs standarts) very pricey monthly fee are paying for guides?
---
Guess i need to farm again :(.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, why does pvp get people so fucking hot and bothered? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any actual risk involved beside maybe some time wasted, but this dumb fuck wasted infinitely more time whining like a lil bitch
---
this reddit makes me feel like my german realm is really just full with good people. Atleast so far I have not encountered any of those horror stories you read on reddit all the time. ninja looting, extreme ganking, mages that think they are joker, excessive layer hopping or begging for inv...
---
Reddit and the forums will be flooded with people begging to release phase 3 lol. I've been trying to warn people who are already complaining about getting ganked now but it's always glossed over by people saying it won't be that bad.
---
It's going to be a shitshow and A LOT of casuals will quit.
---
Talk about shut them down with hard facts. If this was me I would have just apologized and soaked in the info, what a douche
---
Seems pretty marginal when you lay it out like that. Considering Archmage is around 500g (recipe + mats) at the moment, I'm not surprised to see people go for this when it drops instead.
---
It's like an honor code. If it's consumed on use people will frown. Some potions are stupidly powerful, good luck as a warrior or rogue against LIP. Long cooldowns are also looked down upon but that's another thing.
---
Imagine seeing a binding drop two times within a month...
---
Ah I see, is there any way to check how much hit% I have?
---
&gt;Also if you‚Äôre a Druid there won‚Äôt be any Druid trainers in the Orc starting zone
---
the other comment is correct aswell.
---
a rogue guildie of mine leveld his gnome in the nightelve starting zone because he wanted a cat instead of the strider. he didnt have that problem since nightelves can be rogues too.
---
Bad for heart patients too :(
---
Panadol is useless.
---
I would wait a few weeks until the economy has stabilized. Right now, prices are still pretty low because the majority of players hasn't reached 60 yet.
---
What I do is if I leave a realm (did this on pservers) is to go to the level 15-20 area and look for people who are new on the realm. If I find some I give them some gold to have a nice start :) this way your gold is not wasted
---
I think what servers you are on should be in your advert at the very least.
---
Is it for tailoring skillup you want it?
---
No fucking way. Any mage with halfway decent gear could easily be making 300g or more per hour on that server.
---
just 1 shot the hunter, just 1 shot his pet, just 1 shot the server first kazzak. No you have legs and if the hunter cant scatter you are on him regardless of "just do it" style arguments. You have 1 stun and the rogue can wait for the right time maybe wait for sprint.
---
I see what you're saying about not wanting stuff in the middle of your screen - I prefer it there to quickly see everything. Probably just personal preference. The zoom out thingy doesn't change anything for me, I can zoom out as much as I want too.
---
And as for the keybinds: Obviously I use more than those few spells in the middle of my screen, and I do not click a single thing. :D I just don't need to see any of the spells that do not have a cooldown. All my action bars are hidden, but in total there are 5 with 12 buttons each (elvui adds a fifth actionbar, because four isn't enough if you want to bind GFPP, GAPP, FAP, sappers, all kinds of trinkets etc)
---
A founder from the gamma quadrant, makes sense.
---
Does she make strange "sksksksks.." noises too?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and call a Retard Penalty on OP. Do not pass Go, do not collect vendor trash.
---
Weirdos making shit like this be about religion. Ever stopped to consider you're both wrong?
---
Same here, also often just keep on going if the cloth loot seems good. Never had anybody offer me the cloth after I told them what I'm after...lucky you!
---
Per cast maybe but not per rage
---
Our raid has feral druids, ele and enhance shamans and a shadow priest. We clear MC without wipes. Also our main tank is undead and our mages aren't all trolls. You'll be fine.
---
It's being automated most definitely, as there are macro's out there already. One just needs to spam it with a 3rd party program.
---
Right? I had over 100g at 44 by the time I stepped foot in ZF after buying my mount at 40.
---
Now I‚Äôm on my way to 60, currently at 55 and at around 350g. This is with minimal farming that is unrelated to leveling my character or keeping my professions caught up, which are mining and engineering. Not exactly the most profitable for leveling. I have not had a single high value drop either. Most expensive thing I‚Äôve sold is essences and stuff that are around 5g each. 
---
By the time I hit 60 this weekend I should be well over 500g and won‚Äôt have far to go to finish farming for my epic mount.
---
look, if someone within a 5 level range comes up and fights me and i lose. that's cool, i had a fighting chance and felt like if I was able to play it right maybe i could have come out on top. the reason people don't like PVP worlds is because a skull level player can just walk up on you and 2 shot you with not really having anywhere near the tools to need to win that fight. does it help build a decent world on concept? sure, it is afterall a world of warcraft.  but dying to something you have no control over doesn't make for fun or interesting gameplay. you don't get much time on this planet and i would rather not have to waste mine having to walk back to my corpse because some neckbeard that has no real power in life felt the need to get their jollies off.
---
Yup. That rogue who rode past you in phase one isn't going to just ride past now. 
---
There is a reason they call phase 1 the leveling phase haha....
---
Get you main and your alts up now. Leveling will be canceled for months as soon as soon as the ranks start
---
I'm DPS and I usally take it easy during the first minutes of a dungeon to get a grip of the group. If we clear fast and smooth I go full nuke every pull, it's just faster.
---
If there's a weak link in the group I slow down to make sure there's now wipes.
---
Just hit level 53 on my gnome Warlock and wondering where to level next? I've completed Tanaris, STV, Un'Goro and Hinterlands and am just finishing Searing Gorge.
---
Where is next?!
---
Shouldn't be taken lightly wherever it's said. Most gaming companies permanently ban any sort of talk like this. Can't understand how some people think it's ok to say shit like this.
---
Yeah, it will be hard to get into a raid group as a non-resto shaman if you don‚Äôt know the people beforehand. Enhancement is a lot of fun because of wind fury, but ele seems more viable for PvP as it requires less rng and more skill. (Since with elemental mastery the lvl 40 talent you can crit with 2 spells if the first spell doesn‚Äôt hit before the second ie. lightning bolt -&gt; chain lightning at max range)
---
I use Android lol. I'll check it out possibly. I play on a laptop tho, so I don't really need to play on my phone. Would be cool tho.
---
This is easy mode... Try walking next time..
---
I think in silithus are some mages on the top right of silithus.
---
Well that struck me yes.. but first i want to see if there is a slight chance of a trade first :)
---
Phase 2 Arathi/STV battles are going to be epic. Good luck turning in Green Hills of Stranglethorn!
---
Swifty 2.0?
---
It is if you have cleared the bosses to the room with the goblins.
---
Soloable by a few classes.
---
Exactly my thought.
---
Yes, the AH sells it for 60g while the vendor has it for 2g.
---
Its like this in most games with the tank/heal/dps structure, there's not always too many healers but there's almost always a tank shortage. Overwatch is the same, if you queue up as a tank your queue time is much shorter than heal or dps queue
---
A good dps will give you a few seconds to generate aggro and rage before attacking. Seems like an inexperienced player.
---
So Zep from UC to GromGol then.
---
The rich get richer
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people ignore so quickly. It‚Äôs like they fear the sense you are about to bestow on them. Had one Gnomer run that didn‚Äôt end up pushing through because we were Horde and it was taking literally forever to find a healer. With my time to play running out, I didn‚Äôt want to start a run a couldn‚Äôt finish, but being the tank, me leaving meant the run was over. One of our rogues took the teleporter to gnomer and then the run collapsed in on itself. The angry rogue then messaged me ‚ÄúYOU FUCKING IDIOT! NOW IM STRANDED IN GNOMER!!‚Äù And blocked me before I could reply he could simple take the teleporter back to BB. Big man just wanted to berate someone and not have to deal with the response. The little bitch. Tried to save her a HS CD.
---
You obviously don‚Äôt know about mass pulling and the thrash mechanic.
---
"most of the good players"
---
How are they good if they need a broken class to pvp with?   A good player will face roll someone with a sub par class.
---
"I'm frost and I'm cheap." Is probably a pretty common reason. CoC is definitely trained to max level, fire blast maybe not.
---
Yes I started playing December ‚Äò08, two months into WoTLK. 
---
I feel you on that. I was so bad that I actually never hit max level until sometime in Cataclysm lmao. But it would make sense that your original journey to 80 was more difficult, you were also learning the basic functions of the game.
---
I'm currently using blade of shahram during raids, am I better going for this "hamstring spec" or just a standard 2h fury build

Yep you are right, mixed up the 14 minute + 7minute spawn with the 11 minute one.
---
Step 1) Meet nice people
---
Step 2) Help them with no guarantee of return on investment

Step 4) Profit from your friendships more than gold can buy
---
who is speccing shatter to level?
---
People are saving mount money before 40.
---
Yes definitely. I am always interested in doing everything i can to make it as smooth as possible.  
---
When i said that the group never waited for me to get threat i was referring to the entire dungeon run, not just on this boss pull.  
---
Im not sure what else i can do on my end, though. After the fart knockback thing, i charge in on the boss and hit her with like 4 mauls, one of which crit. Through the entire time she is just going ham on my healer and killed the healer before switching back to me. Is it possible that this healer was pulling more threat than you would in the same situation? I noticed the healer probably wasnt downscaling any spells. always waited for me to be at around 50% hp before hitting me with a very big heal.
---

Real value should be closer to 2%.

Do Burning steps if you haven't already and then Western Plaguelands should open up to you at 54.

BRD is actually fun though.

Exactly

How did they not melt tho
---
I‚Äôve never taken the leap to hide all my action bars. I guess I just always want them visible so I can see everything at a glance. üòä
---
Your character was so brutal in combat, that you literally devastated the enemy (smashing them to bids or slicing them apart), their blood splashed all to the ground and on your armor and there's not much left to collect into a vial.
---
Hybrids kill slower, but often don't have a lot of downtime which helps. Druids are considered one of the faster leveling classes as feral.
---
Yeah skinning won't make you much at 60. You can get some valuable skins in raids so guilds have one skinner for the job but that's about it. Enchanting is kinda useless if you don't take the time to farm rare enchants (crusader, 4 stats, thorium/AD reputation, MC patterns).
---
Or raiding with half a group.
---
You must be looking at a wrong source, all databases I check list them in the low singles.
---
If i put on big-spender pants on today. and wanna buy best BOE weapon in AH for fury warrior. What do i buy? 
---
Hit me with top 3 weapon!
---
Because the average person is dumb as fuck. I sell the Blackstone ring from Mara and when people hear that I'm selling it for 20g they say "roflno". They'd rather farm it for 8 hours than pay 20g... half an hours worth of gold farm. 
---
I'd happily pass 5g worth of vendor trash per person to a tank that'll double the clear speed of the dungeon because I can make quadruple that gold back with the time I've saved...
---
I'm a level 31 human mage, at what level could I consistently run Scarlet Monastery? I've heard that's the place to get reliable silk cloth drops for my (insane) tailoring needs lmao
---
P.S. I mostly play fighting games, this is the first time I've played WoW. 
---
My friend with ungodly amounts of time in Retail convinced me to start playing WoW Classic with him from launch. I absolutely love it but man do I feel like a noob.
---
Aggro on a healer can also be a dps problem. If dps pulls aggro and I have to heal 4 people instead of 1 and the tank can't build aggro cause he's chasing mobs I'll get heal aggro eventually.
---
I know the feel, when creating my Warrior Alt I wasn't allowed to name myself "Jigglytank" or "Jiggletank"
---
They really aren't that juicy. Most of them is in range 0.7-2 gold, and you need more and more money as you level up. I feel that comparatively it stays the same just because of inflation.

---
You answered your own question because people do it to try and get the last word in and then run to their Gchat and complain about x player being shit and that this is why wow classic community is shit and it isnt TRUE vanilla.
---
He can't answer, he got nuked
---
Guessing you've nerver played pala then.
---
Loch modan -&gt; wetlands -&gt; arathi -&gt; hillsbrad foothills (get thesouthshore flight point there for easier access in the future)
---
From there, you either go on the eastern shore of the lake (NW from the village), past undercity into tirisfal glades or follow the road through silverpine into tirisfal glades
---
SM is in the northeastern part of that region.
---
Wait until she gets to darkshore and learns that the rotting bear carcasses sell for ONE SILVER each! 
---
Makes you feel like royalty tbh, especially since you end up killing SO MANY bears in that zone
---
‚ÄúHow slow do you have to level to make friends?‚Äù 
---
Interesting type of question. I don‚Äôt believe there is any correlation to ‚Äúleveling-speed‚Äù and ‚Äúamount of friends you make‚Äù. But I do see your dilemma. I made a lot of friends and yes we were all the same level early on, and we slowly started to out level each other. I still talk to them whenever they are on to keep the friendship there and once they hit 60 I‚Äôll be there to run dungeons with them :). Another great way to meet people is through dungeons. Right now, everyone at 60 are running high end dungeons like Scholo/BRS/BRD etc. for their BiS and I found Already met a good amount of people at end game  through dungeon grinding.
---
Let me describe a situation wherein I might pull, as healer.
---
Tank is standing in place, looking at a couple packs of mobs.
---
A patrol of a single mob is wandering around.
---
I know I can solo that single one easily, but he is a pain as an add to any other group.
---
The pat is within range to be single pulled, but he is walking away and will be out of range in a couple of seconds.
---
SW:P it is.
---
The pornhub part checks out though!
---
in german "fotze" means pussy and in slang you lose the e at the end so it somewhat sounds like the first part of that name. always makes me smile when I read it in chat. So here I am a grown man over 30, playing a game that I used to play when I was in school and I still am immature enough to laugh about stuff like that! NO CHANGES! :D
---
I think the problem lays til ZF and Uldaman. You face lots of newbies and alts who hurry a lot.
---
Once you hit some higher level dungueons, you decide how fast you going. And It is on you how you handle everything. You only need to join the lfg channel to see those guys asking for tank for an hour, you really think they wouldnt try to do every reasonable thing you asked them to do? I have seen tanks get into dungueons they are not ready for just because people gets tired. And even if the tank do som shit they consent it as soon as he says sorry
---
videos/streams are you best bet here.
---
Troll loa worship is going too far.
---
Actually agree here. It also makes me less inclined to help when people don't seem to be able to type in complete sentences, skip punctuation, or make unnecessary abbreviations (come on, do you really think you save a lot of time typing 'u' instead of 'you'? You're not texting me from an old Nokia3310). I know it's not intended to come off this way, but it makes me feel like the person doesn't really care about their interaction with you. And it almost always comes off looking more rude than they maybe intended.
---
I've had other people of the same class just randomly ask me stuff on /w, without saying hello or asking if I can answer a few questions, typing like a pre-teen who's been told that butchering English is cool. If you want legit advice - don't do that.
---
Classic has a lot of 'oldies' and just people in general who value proper (ish) communication, it's not mostly kids anymore.
---
Thats the fault of the dps but people are conditioned to do that from modern wow over the years, if you enjoy warrior look.into dual wield  tanking videos  for when you reach higher lvl but yeah you are in the right on this
---
Apologies if this isn't what you mean, but people often stress the importance of getting hit cap as if it were a matter of simple logic, and it really isn't. Hit cap is *usually* a top priority for DPS because of the way item budgeting and stat scaling works, but we know this because people actually work out the math and run the simulations, not because "missing does no damage, QED." If you have to give up 2% of your damage per hit to increase hit chance by 1%, it's not such a great deal; it's just that it doesn't usually work out that way.
---
There's no logical reason that hit capping has to be optimal, and in fact there have been times when hit capping was not a priority for certain specs.
---
I feel so dumb.. 10y since I played, started again in the weekend. Cheers.
---
I have had the same experience with the "LFG" channels, people are much more immature there.  
---
I guess it's because they contain all the people who CBA to stay in the zone or a major city to look for a group.
---
21-8-22 or a 31/8/12 variant
---
21/8/22 has more control, 31/8/12 has more burst, 31/8/12 is also not complete ass for raiding
---
Such a strange class. Easiest by far to solo with, but also one of the easiest to completely fuck your dungeon group if you're a new player.
---
It's like blizzard wanted everyone to hate us
---
The real gold was the friends we made along the way
---
Yeah I mean its pve who cares.. and even by pve standards classic raids are easy until Nax/AQ40.
---
Also the definition of weak.
---
If the tanks dies the healer is a noob.
---
If the healer dies the tank is a noob incapable of getting threat
---
If the dps dies, hes stupid.
---
I fish in the Bay of Storms area of Azshara, and I make plenty good money there. You need 300 fishing and must use +75 bauble at a minimum.  Req. 330 to fish and 425 for none to get away. Both winter squid and stonescale have a good catch rate there. You'll get a lot of big mouth clams which have a chance for golden pearls which are going 18g each on my server. Also if you go around the islands and coast pools for essence of water pop up fairly frequently.
---
I think a lot of is is because there is no cross real, so if you scam people of money your reputation is in risk. Unless youre in a olympus kinda guild i guess you dont need to care about it, but other guilds prob dont want members hustling others.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPBlDOaio1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPBlDOaio1I)
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôd be totally fine with that - pats I think are fine for the dps to pull if they‚Äôre done skillfully since they‚Äôre almost always small enough to not even need a tank for.  But if you mess it up imma go off lol.
---
In a way I hope he does get a name change so the moron who reported him gets to know that he will never have the name no matter how pathetic he is at attempting to take it from total random players.
---
 I cant stand fishing.   I probably spent 100g for stonescale eel, because I dont want to fish that shit later, and it seems cheap atm for some reason.
---
it's all good. If a mage has to pass put water for afew mins to afew members I tip them
---
I always try to replay Titanic on the Zeppelin. Who else does that?
---
Well their wrong for sure
---
Why do NPC Warlock's Void Walkers not disappear when the warlock dies, but imps do?
---
You have the dungeon tanking build... so tank dungeons? Seriously, AoE SM grind is the fastest way to level 30-44, and tanks are the most sought after role.
---
There's this one site, I don't remember the name, something to do with a bay of water and some swashbucklers, maybe?
---
Yeaahh. Sometimes It helps me realise the limits of the party and thats great. It is kinda infuriating when I first see it tho. I just wanna feel everything is inncontrol :P
---
Thx i will test it
---
Pretty sure it doesn't work in games. Even in borderless
---
Yes, i hear the best way to farm honor is to camp honorless targets as the port in.
---
I‚Äôm probably not the best rogue to ask unfortunately. From my short experience with double sword, I do pump out a lot of damage. I cannot speak on the sword Mh dagger OH because I‚Äôve never used it. If you are searching for the most fun playstyle then just do what you want. If you are trying to minmax and be efficient as possible, I‚Äôd try to do some further research on utube extremely. There are a ton of ‚Äúserious‚Äù rogue leveling guides.
---
Yeah I'm horde, thanks
---
Also would u rate it over obsidian edged blade?
---
Long term it can still be significant loss or gain. To even out statistically you have to play literally hundreds of games, which you probably don't.
---
And I often answer "Dude I'm fishing"
---
Not sure about SM, but I've had good luck with getting silk cloth in Thousand Needles as Horde, but I see Alliance there often.
---
Nope, but the ratio is not even comparable to mages.  Any reason you selected such a pointless criteria or are you unable to comprehend that when people complain about mages they are not talking about ALL mages.
---
Well, that's why I've got rules for when I might pull as non-tank.
---
Basically if the tank decides not to get involved it shouldn't be a problem, so why should they care?
---
This is the macro you want for only bag
---
 /run for i=1,GetMerchantNumItems() do local l=GetMerchantItemLink(i) if l then if l:find("Pattern: Runecloth Bag") then BuyMerchantItem(i, 10)end end end
---
You can get it even while camped, I've done it more than once.
---
I personally wouldn‚Äôt go this route, I hopped realms myself but just kinda left all my other characters as they were in case I felt like going back at some point, if you really wanna use your stuff just give it to some low level new players who could benefit from it
---
Prolly depends on race and level
---
They're mocking the people who do reservation runs. Hopefully.
---
To be honest I don't really understand why everyone hate reservations. If you don't like it, make your own group.
---
I've had crusader for like 2-3 weeks, and thus far I've done 2 enchants and made a grand total of 8g.  Spent 100g for the recipe.
---
The 10 min cd? Thats my panick button and using it usually means I gotta get tougher with ny party members xd
---
Is there an addon that tracks instancelockouts? Knowing precisely when I can fish for Jed again would be immensely helpful.
---
I'd rather farm the gold somewhere else and buy it off of AH, that particular part of Silithus is pure cancer on a horde dominated server.
---
I used this mace as my main Melee weapon until Ravager, and my healing weapon for another 10 levels after that. Well worth it.
---
Yeah I mean it's not impossible for healers to pull aggro but In that case they should be popping all their threat mitigation. I'm a paladin so thats a plus in a situation like that but I mean even a priest should be able to outheal her until you or even someone else can peal.
---
Haha, thanks mate!
---
I did that fight with my whole group being lowbies(42/43), its not a hard fight if everyone knows what to do. The boss himself doesnt hit hard so the healer just needs to stretch out heals and try and regain mana, while dps esentially go afk for the tank and get the adds in the room. Once the tank has 5 sunders the dps can step up on dps but its better to stretch it even further out. Letting phase 2 happen and killing the adds then saving all mana and cooldowns for phase 3. If you tank him in the sidehall at low level you will prolly die as the eilite golems which hit very hard are going to kill you. And since your in the sidehall they wont despawn when the boss dies.  Either everyone in your group doesn't know how the fight works or people are just going ham out of the gate. Hes not a burst fight its an endurance fight.
---
/r/nevertellmetheodds
---
I played on Frostwhisper too (transferred during TBC and played until end of WOTLK)!
---
On Alliance though and I guess you guys were horde? :(
---
bring nature pots to absorb the fart spray.
---
Well, with a high IQ, you 're considered a stable genius.
---
Classic WoW is like fucking heroin.
---
And retailers are like the people who think you can OD on Marijuana - never had any experience with any drugs other than alcohol and tobacco but somehow think that these stories of people shitting all over train station toilets and passing out are all there is to heroine, totally ignoring the blissful feeling people get from shooting it. 
---
Now nobody is saying heroine is good for people but if you ask the people who take heroine, they'll tell you it's the best thing ever.
---
(disclaimer: I've never taken heroine and am not planning to unless maybe if I got a terminal desease and am gonna die in a week anyways)
---
I think partying makes it a bit faster by killing the regen time somewhat. At least in my experience
---
What a guy. Human decency transcends factions my friend.
---
Lol I haven‚Äôt bought skills in 15 levels. Went to UC and finally got everything I have been missing.
---
It is known.
---
There is also Azeroth Auto Pilot which is completely free and has better quality (imo)
---
Threat is a *group* problem. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs respond to manage their threat. Part of what makes this game *feel* like an MMO is that everyone in the group matters.
---
Truestrike have no stats either
---
Wyrmhide are good until you can get your hits from someplace else
---
both Wyrmtongue Shoulders and shadowcraft shoulders have a good amount of AGI on them
---
you only technically need to ready 9% hit if you are playing combat, you dont NEEd the houlders to do that. IIRC the rogue BIS list puts you at like 13 or 14% to hit 
---
im at 10% without the shoulders and bow
---
Stonks
---
Ya I've been offered it a few times. Was definitely suprised. I never mind helping and feel bad declining but skilling up is rough at certain points.
---
Isnt this most leveling guides? Unless you're a hunter or warlock and grinding every mob from point A to point B, ive heard they can be a slog as you quickly start to fall behind.
---
I made a macro for that. middle mouse button is my go to button for mobility like travel form. When I'm in another form, I get out of it with that button. It's second nature for me to just press a mouse button every time I approach an NPC or quest objective.
---
wow classic has some real dick wads in it.
---
Every time someone writes "x them for a couple hours" it's probably just once or twice lmao
---
Yeah I dont really need anything else , just need that MC gear.
---
HORDS DO DRUGS, FUCKING PISSERS
---
Haha, good memory you have üòÑ I'm still not even 60 yet, but if you have need for an healer at anytime, hit me up!
---
Red is dead mate. Live by it.
---
It's kind of a no win situation tbh. If you kill them on sight, you're almost 100% guaranteed to get ambushed when they come back. 
---
Honestly, I say just leave them be and do random flares behind you every now and again, maybe even place a trap and then move a few steps forward. 
---
Outside of that, roll a paladin. Pretty much your only hope lol.
---
They're not gonna open transfers off LOW pop servers lmfao.
---
COLLUSION! BANnNNNNnnnnNnn REeeeeeeeEeee
---
But yeah it happens alot. I'm the kinda guy who will mind control you off a boat, or mind control you because your buffs fell off, and I'll re apply them. 
---
All depends on the situation. Lol
---
Hahaha, I'll be using that one!
---
Its extremely fin just running as a line member but i dont recomend anyone to aim for a leadership position as it‚Äôs a lot of work.  
---
It‚Äôs a game where the developers aren‚Äôt punishing grieffing and destruction of other players assets.  
---
Fooling someone is allowed (outside of the beginners system) 
---
But I can fully se why you say that because eve is not for everyone.
---
Looks like mostly talented into ele but I couldn‚Äôt see enough detail to say for sure cuz could be a resto/ele build
---
Correct
---
If it is, comparatively, that's actually pretty reassuring!
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Chance is 1.
---
I've been able to learn Armorsmith recipes and I'm only 274/300. Have you unlocked the quests to get Imperial Plate?
---
So you got... cuk'd ?
---
true\`?
---
Not sure which you are referring to, but all the imps left from NPC warlocks I kill, persist and need killing also.
---
So keep gloves that are BiS for every other race forever so that you can use daggers better for a short time until you either outgrow dagger content (phase 3) or get the better dagger gloves (available phase 1).
---
You have to realize how crazy that is. Also Edgemasters only marginally affects chance for Annihilator to apply debuff (that is me assuming you have to hit for it to apply).
---
It's just not very good on humans.
---
Because reservation runs are stupid. You're basically asking people to help you, but then telling them all the shit they can't have. If it's maybe 1 thing specifically for your class as say the tank or healer that's one thing. But blanket reserves are just fucking stupid since you're basically asking people to come help for basically nothing, as close to r/choosingbeggars as you can get
---
The bit about having to cater to a maturing player base ( e.g. empty leveling zones as most players are at end game ) is an interesting point I never considered - the social dependency we are seeing flourish currently on Classic, like finding groups manually - is great but you can also see why they decided to implement LFG.
---
I was going hardcore on my hunter but my girlfriend decided to play so I'm splitting my time now with a priest so she can destroy as a warrior. We just broke into the 20s last night and are having a ball. We had our first real pvp encounter (real as in a fairish fight, not a level 60 ganking us before we know what's happening) and she did really good! We have only ran into one unpleasant person so far and it was more entertaining than off putting. She bought a new sword off the AH last night and at the end of the night she was pushing me to keep going. Couldn't be happier with our classic casual play so far. No rush for phase 2. No complaints.  Just happy to be here.
---
WITH THE LORD MY PROTECTOR
---
It's so fucking useful to have this rogue paying attention where you're tanking, see the pat, starts to move the stuff and you see this mage his back turned spamming frostbolts about to aggro... And he distracts. That's where heroism is at.
---
Na it‚Äôs 7 or 8 which is equally scary
---
What happens to your ships and stuff when you log out? Do they disappear with you or remain in the game world? If they remain in the game world, how do you guys keep them safe?
---
You can do the ony chain in raid btw! So no need to leave :)
---
MAKE THEM BOW TO MY WILL
---
I gave up doing quests in STV, too many players there, takes x4 times as long to get anything done &gt;.&lt;
---
Is there a reliable way to kill Onyxia without clown fiesta in P3 with her running around one-shotting people? Every kill I've been on we were basically playing russian roulette, surely there's gotta be a more consistent way of doing it.
---
From what I understand, aggro reset comes from P2 fireballs, which are fired at the highest threat targets, wiping their threat on impact. Some videos suggest maintank (who is not tanking ony on P1) stay in the middle of the pack and pop DPS cooldowns as she's about to land, but that assumes P2 has a certain duration, otherwise she might have enough time to fireball both tanks and then you're screwed.
---
It might be better to get her used to WASD earlier rather than later.
---
I know from painful experience.
---
Roll druid, tank through leveling, then switch to healing at 60 when healers are in demand for raids.
---
I had a gnome warlock named Gulpttub back in WOTLK. On an RP server. Good thing Blizzard doesn't bother to read the names backwards.
---
I once whispered a guy who needed a tank how many plate wearers there were. He said 1 and quickly followed up with "I'll ive you 15g to join". Like, fuckin' sure mate I was about to do it for free.
---
r/thatsthejoke
---
Dont aggrevate rogues would be my advice, if u see a rogue around just avoid that area and come back. I can tell you as a rogue main lvl 60, i do not kill every single player. 
---
That being said if you gank me when im dealing with mobs( especially alot of hunters), i will absolutely grief you, everytime we meet again. You will land on my KoS list and then you will be in much bigger trouble.
---
It's harder for the tank to get aggro from the mob you pulled than to keep aggro if he had pulled it himself.  
---
I was tempted to just pull with my wand a few times when a single pat was near and save to pull. But I never went trough with it because the tank is the one who pulls - without exceptions.  
---
And nobody gets hurt if the tank takes a few more seconds to pull the next group.
---
Mark them, you will see them come towards you or they run away.
---
I second rock elementals. The ones in the southern Badlands are 39-40 and have about 16 in a nice loop evenly spaced. Pretty easy xp and gold per hour - roughly 20k xp and probably 5-10g.
---
Priest shields block warrior rage so reserve them for ‚Äùoh shit‚Äù moments until you can get a heal on them.
---
Ye, might have killed you once though ;)
---
Do you have an ability in your spellbook named "armorsmithing", and did your blacksmithing icon change to a plate chestpiece icon? If not, you aren't done yet.
---
Genius.
---
I really don't get some people. On my mage, it's always the first thing I ask when the group is full - "Would anyone like some food/water". It's no big deal and people are always grateful. I don't see why you wouldn't do it.
---
Poor worf.
---
The character written to come up with all the obvious but wrong solutions, just to make Picard/Riker/Data look good.
---
The majority of your damage even in Ret is auto swing so more strength is more damage. I'm leveling Ret will basically no int gear at all. You simply don't need it in my opinion. 
---
Also your weapon is massively important. Get into a Gnomeragon run and get the axe from last boss that will be a big help. He'll the crowd pummeler might be an upgrade but slower is always better.
---
Merci. I'm adding them to my KOS list.
---
I think dungeon runs where everything goes wrong but you still come through are the ones where you get your loot. 
---
I've done about 10-15 UBRS runs by now, all of them wipe-free except for a few wipes at Drakkisath (son of a bitch). Not once I've seen the shield. Yesterday, a more than 2 hour run with a dozen wipes, a raid reset due to a bugged out Rend event, and replacing half the raid over the run, and it finally dropped for me. 
---
On a side not, not seen shoulders or any of the Dal'Rends once. Luckily I don't need the swords as Orc ...
---
I tried. She prefers the arrow keys . But she also clicks all of her abilities. Her gaming experience before this was a couple weeks of the sims when she broke her ankle.  She‚Äôs got a lot to learn lol
---
Poster didnt ask about open transfers.
---
thats because they think its a private server. they'll get the hit soon
---
Level 45 is about the halfway point for leveling, so I'll use that and not level 40.
---
For many people playing for the first time without a guide etc., they will probably take about 15 days played to 60, so half would be 7-8 days.
---
Experienced players will probably do it in 8 days or so, so about 4 days for half of it.
---
Of course there are extreme cases way below or above that, but I'd guess most will be in between those numbers.
---
Roll on a pve server and stop bitching
---
I agree, and also, I just learned there are zeps in grom'gol like three weeks ago.
---
Have played since vanilla beta. Lol.
---
Hey I actually recognize u. Bigglesworth rise up
---
Do these people  or realize they gain a server reputation in classic?
---
It's not low pop today, it's a high/full realm too, but it was the lowest pop at the time before any new realms came (which means it was still full, but with a 30 min queue instead of 7 hours).
---
Don't worry about tailoring. Focus on getting your mount, then at 40+ you will earn plenty of gold so you can buy all the silk cloth you could ever need and more.
---
I really preferred the BC method where the small ones drop frequently that you combine into the actually useful ones. Defs see why they did that after vanilla
---
They did exist but not until like a year and a half after
---
Retribution stat priority while levelling:
---
1) +hit is great if you can get it, but it's a seriously rare stat.
---
2) Strength/AP and agility/crit.
---
3) Spirit (only while levelling, forget all about it at 60).
---
4) Stamina.
---
That's it. Forget int for solo play. It doesn't really do anything.
---
With ret, you just want to seal Command (usually rank 1, only the judgement gets stronger with higher ranks) and autoswing away. Against mobs that live for 20+ seconds, seal wisdom and judge it first. Against weaker mobs, don't judge.
---
Your damage will be \~70% autoattack, \~30% seal of command. Consecration requires 5+ targets to be worth the mana (rank 1 is alright is there's JoWisdom on your target).
---
Autoattack and SoCommand both scale well with physical stats (and SLOW 2-handed weapons). All you need mana for is healing, cleanse and such.
---
i was like: 10g to roll on greens in SM? hmm
---
" You're much less likely to encounter wandering monsters while following a road."
---
currently lvl45, sadly its rare i ever get long enough periods of free to run dungeons so its most all questing or grinding (damned full time career! lol)
---
Try several guilds. I am in my third since starting and it's the best so far. They started raiding, many active players daily and casual atmosphere in the chat. As you can't browse guilds anywhere, it's a hit or miss thing.
---
As a healer, I find a tank and start a group around us. This solves most problems as you can weed out jokers and jackers. Keep pushing through because an endgame tank is the most coveted class.

Got 10 essence of water from Toxic Horrors in Felwood in about 2 hours yesterday, drop rate seems decent. Got 2 essence of air in 2 hours from the elementals in Silithus, drop rate seems less decent :D 24% is definitely highly inaccurate, i'd put it at more like 2-3%.
---
It‚Äôs what replaces your xp bar since you no longer have a use for it
---
Thanks! Im 30/0/21.
---
Currently I out heal most healers in are raids as this spec with the right +healing/mp5 gear equip, I melt people 1 on 1 in WPvP and in duels thanks to my stam/+spell dmg stacking PvP gear. I can grind Demonic Runes for days to compensate for my lack of mana tide totem.
---
I'll post more vids over time of my shaman shenanigans!
---
Congrats. This should be fun for a very long time.
---
Top 3 weapons are all BOP.
---
There is a difference between:
---
A 40 man raid clearing MC in 2-3 evenings. 
---
And 
---
Anything but naxxramas is so ez you only need 25-30 to steamroll it. 
---
Yes, I agree MC is super easy. But saying everyone can clear it with 25 people is just stupid.
---
I think a lot of people(like myself) went online to check guides and a lot of them recommend Tailoring and Enchanting. What they do not mention, is that in an economy as busted as Classic's, this is a very very bad idea. Ended up getting to Enchanting 100ish before swapping to Skinning. Gold really spiked after that, just slamming everything to the AH, even doing dungeons becomes quite lucrative if you get leathers and whatnot. There is a light at the end of the lvl 40 tunnel now.
---
Not if you use it as a nickname
---
Yeah, I feel the pain (not of the ankle, but that does sound painful!).
---
I tried my best to not dictate how my wife should play, but I did insist on WASD when she was learning Left 4 Dead, it's for her own good.
---
Well, what the OP is asking is what are the odds of rolling a sequence, which is lower than a non-sequence.
---
God, such a loan shark (/s)
---
counterspell is a 30sec cd chances are the mage already used it or the mob is immune / resisted
---
I've been doing exactly this recently, works well :)
---
What servers still have layers?
---
Perfect example of the typical rogue mindset. Every gank is personal.
---
&gt; since you're basically asking people to come help for basically nothing
---
I mean sure, if you're reserving literally anything that's useful in the dungeon, then that's a problem. But it's only a problem if you actually *join* that group, which you are under no obligation to do.
---
I don't do reservations myself, but I don't see why it's a problem that people are upfront about it. It's better than just ignoring classes that can roll on the same items as you.
---
How is educating you on dualscreens being defensive? We're just trying to get you up to speed gramps.
---
(Putting text between parentheses does not give your point any more validity)
---
In the case of a paladin this isn't as big of a deal. See Flash of Light is essentially a hyper efficient and fast Holy Light whereas Holy Light never gets a cast time increase. So generally speaking the equivalent of a downcast Holy Light is to simple cast Flash of Light, though I haven't reached a very high level yet so I might change my mind later on. Were this any other class though I'd completely agree with you.
---
Just did this quest. Lord this is annoying .
---
Saw a character name that I thought was a reference to a book character, specific name, perfect fit... nope, kid got it from some anime. Sorry to bother you "Ticktockman".
---
understandable but it works for me. I usually save space for additional spells and then just rearrange them properly when i have every spell later on.
---
Show me a case where cross faction had been banned and something in the last 5 years that where it says it is bannable. Frowned upon sure but not agAinst the rules .
---
Some people want them to be seen as some kind of guardian angel  for giving you a 5 min bow/bom etc when inreality your gonna do just fine without them and then when ultimately people don't say thank you they act as if they have been personally wronged by not being thanked. Its really really weird.
---
They often run back to the dead warlocks body and despawn. Voids never do!
---
If it matters to you, most Rank 12/13/14 grinding groups won‚Äôt be taking either a Spriest or a Hunter in their groups
---
because you have better options and dont need it.
---
the lvl 1 is enough for pulls and quickly destroying 1 hit adds / totems
---
I was in ungoro leveling my priest with skining. There was a rogue fighting devilsaur. He was dieing and i was standing there to steal the devilsaur when he dies. He vanished 1 hit before and i finished of devilsaur and when i tried to skin it he beat me to it and got the skin. He thanked me and gave me 5 gold thinking i just arrived to help him. He still doesnt know i m scum of the earth.
---
As a priest, I stopped buffing, healing and ressing random allies until I was oom. I better safe my mana for myself, since apparently I shoulnd't expect help if I aggro 3-4 mobs (which I still can handle with enough mana).
---
Nice thanks!
---
At which point the top guild on the server absorbs all the tanks.
---
Paladin healing gear is mainly a mix of cloth and leather, with the occasional piece of mail. This doesn't really change 'till Naxramas (seriously there's almost no plate healing gear 'till the very last raid instance). If you want to gear for healing, you have to roll for cloth.
---
Paladin tanking gear = warrior tanking gear. Forget int. From MC and onwards, a lot of it says "warrior only", so you don't get to upgrade anymore.
---
This is a really stupid "insult". But yes, know it all, I played 15 years ago. 
---
And I have never in my life played a "private" server (that's what you meant to type but you are too busy hyperventilating trying to acksually me)
---
Eh, I stream it makes WoW leveling a little less dull haha.
---
I think you get significantly less rep when you do grey quests. I think you would have in this instance do the quests when they are in your level range, but again, no way to get exalted through questing alone, but only in combo with cloth turn ins, which is expensive. 
---
You can just survive the kodo for 20 levels and at 60 farm the rep. I have the same problem as a nelf druid as I could only get a tiger but I actually like the goat a lot more. Was planning to farm Ironforge rep at 60 for it.
---
You can also use it to split packs, for example if you want to kill Steelsnap without his adds.
---
Keep in mind that if you group, as a general rule, you can kill mobs at a faster rate with less downtime so the amount of loot you‚Äôd get over the same amount of time is relatively similar. There‚Äôs rarely a benefit to soloing.
---
I feel there were multiple ways to avoid this happening.
---
Uhm, not really. DW threat keeps scaling significantly better with gear than a bear. Right now ferals are very potent tanks. And unlike paladins they stay viable all the way up to Naxx. But Warrior simply is the best MT class.
---
Why play a druid? You are gonna have the same leveling experience as a rogue :P
---
Always kill rogues on sight. As a hunter if you see them first they dont stand a chance. If hes too high a level then just leave. I rarely fight enemy players lower levels than me, but I fuck rogues up everytime I see em. Anyone that plays such a brain dead class deserves being camped.
---
I read a great post about upgrading from WW axe and the breakdown on different weapons/speeds  
---
 [https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/36841-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-from-your-ww-axe/](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/36841-how-to-know-when-to-upgrade-from-your-ww-axe/)
---
the triggering
---
Some people like to misconstrue ‚ÄúThe Community‚Äù as an expectation for strangers to always go out of their way to help them.
---
Imagine holding the door for someone and then getting mad when they don‚Äôt offer to carry your shopping bags for you.
---
It‚Äôs not laziness, someone will respond positively to it eventually. Formalities are only important for some people. I have an English degree and write emails all day, when someone asks me to ‚Äúcome heal BRD‚Äù I respond in kind, ‚Äúnah about to log‚Äù, ‚Äúsure, can u summon me?‚Äù
---
It is rightfully alliance lands snatched by the forsaken after the terror of the lich king
---
Usually all it takes to get righteous revenge though

---
I have it but I haven't run into anyone else using it yet :(
---
Me too
---
What class are you? PvP success requires using a lot more tools from your kit than the PvE in most cases.
---
Or you could use /startattack macros like all other melee
---
Especially if you tanked while leveling too.  People remember the good tanks and hit them up for dungeons all the time.  I have 2-3 healers that immediately message me as soon as I get on.  
---
I‚Äôm not 60 yet, but I have a feeling that I may end up grinding out dungeons the rest of the way.
---
Yeah why not.
---
i dunno but with 16% crit i still very often have streaks of like 4-6 crits in a row.  feels like we're playing on retro wow not a blizzard realm.
---
in fact i kind of have a conspiracy theory that this isn't the original data at all lol, so much stuff feels very weird
---
yeah but the prices haven't settled yet, I thought it may be because few players are in the level range to farm it and even fewer in the range to use it
---
Yeah I've done this. There's a quest in Searing Gorge where you have to kill an elite who is guarded by another two elites.
---
An alliance warlock showed up and helped me by fearing the adds and DPSing the boss. Then I waited around and helped him as well. Then he got ganked by a horde group as we were leaving the cave.
---
Such is life.
---
Right under our noses the whole time
---
Rofl
---
Thanks!
---
What a nice idea. All I need now is: friends.
---
A mage got a HoJ? Why??
---
Every mob in felwood and ungoro. Im lvl 52
---
Yeah on tanks look at the final boss level and be below 3 max.
---
It sucks we already xp slowly but when you reach the level then you can spam :p
---
Those essences, mostly air &amp; fire but sometimes also live &amp; water always were \~15-20g back then on my retail vanilla server and it always confused me why they were going much cheaper on most private servers. I farmed a lot of those back then just to make money and sometimes went for hours without a drop, imho their current ah prices are much closer to actual vanilla than they were on pservers.
---
appropriately tagged as humor
---
Why 2 warlocks and 2 hunters? I understand twinking and trying different classes but this?
---
I'm late to this thread but got my xbow today after about 30 undead strat runs (still no fucking pants though) and this hurt me to read. At least the warrior didn't win it
---
Damn.. I had my "Boomcumshot" name till lvl 27
---
Not every gank is personal friend, if it is a fair fight and you win ill do /clap and take my leave. 
---
However if 2 hunters gang up on me from behind when im on a mob, you can be sure they are in for a hell of a time, the moment they drop their guard.
---
Or u could play how I like to....
---
I did that quest yesterday, but when I went back to org to buy the mithril casing, I bought 5 instead, and sold them in the zone for 4x what I paid
---
Well I would see this as a cross-faction collusion which results in disruptive behaviour. 
---
This is against the Terms of Service and a bannable offense. You got good Video material of this. Your own faction showing the other faction where you are hiding and helping them chase you down. In order to get the devilsaur leather. Which is (IMO) definitely disruptive.
---
There has not been good examples on this since - in retail - there is no real cross faction collusion Happening :D
---
Everything is cross faction / cross realms anyway there is not much to disrupt by colluding cross-faction. Therefore there is no good example case for this. 
---
In Classic this is very much different though. I would surely give this a try. Even if it just results in a 24h ban. 
---
Get those suckers and make sure they don't do it again. There is a reason we can't make Horde and Alliance chars on the same realm. This is not supposed to happen
---
?? ??
---
What would a shaman or paladin use a 2 hander for, especially one that doesn't grant them any of the stats they want.
---
Why do it?
---
Because i know somewhere in the world someone like you will sit and wonder "why?". Thats why i do it.
---
You're aware that the trinket it also your healers reason to go in there, right?
---
pvp and any situation where you aren't attacking a mob with +3 lvls on you
---
Yes but playing the way you prefer is vastly different from saying its needed
---
I also cant stealth past the lvl 49 elites on front of BRD's entrance.
---
Agreed! Felwood is nice at this level (just finished up there myself).
---
You may have to wait until after Xmas for phase 2...
---
This is exactly why I keep random int scroll drops. Really helps when I have to use a new weapon with 0 skill
---
[He did](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/BAKpKfH)
---
I think some of the hardcore members will start looking at alts if they can stomach the level process again. It's a lot easier with a main and gold.
---
Gearing up alts, gold is always useful. There is still stuff to do, you just gotta figure it out yourself.
---
I think the "set your own goal" mindset is a big draw of classic. In retail the stuff you do feels like chores and not something you do with a personal goal in mind. Do World Quests, get you +10 keystone in, get consumes for raid, do this months rep grind etc... Chores.
---
Camping the flight points into Blackrock Mountain seems like a lot of fun, even though it doesn't have an intrinsic reward other than salty alliance and getting blacklisted on the server discord.
---
I thought druid couldn't use potions in bear form?
---
No its still normap bs icon. Thx for reply, looks like im lost in the process somewhere..
---
&gt; I maxed just over a week
---
Understandable in that case.
---
Gotta be intentional
---
There is a generations joke in there somwhere
---
I mean, as soon as she goes to land no one should be touching her until the main tank has a girl, and the off tanks have been also hitting her. I think that's the easy part really, the hard part is usually people getting one shot by the deep breath. Make sure everyone stops dots on her when she is around 45% that way when she recites a girl she won't run around to the castros.
---
I bound the second action bar and put non-combat spells there. Portals, water, arcane intellect, etc. all share keybinds with other spells. Also bound the first to switch back of course. Besides, I still have a keys/combinations left for engineering items that will come in the future
---
I'm on my #99 angerforge run. Still dont saw a HoJ dropping.
---
As long as you're up front, I see literally nothing wrong with getting help from others.
---
Seriously doubt they're going to mess about with paid transfers while the game is still so new. They're still allowing server populations to stabilise via the free transfers, so that they can shut layering off before P2. I wouldn't expect paid transfers before then.
---
So it‚Äôs gotten to the point people are complaining about the game working as intended now.  Got it.
---
I like to think us Tanks and Healers can bond over our mutual hatred of all DPS.
---
I think I found another one, in Arathi there is a place called Refugee Point, but for some reason the game has it as Refugee Pointe.. Or am I misremembering which one is correct? lol
---
That's some sick keybinds you got there!
---
First of all, big gratz! Hope I can get mine soon :) or one of Rag's weapons.
---
Obsidian edged blade is pretty fast, for a 2h weapon, so would decidedly recommend not using Slam with it and going with Hamstring spam to dump Rage in between BT / WW usages. Good luck!
---
Similar story.  Had a rogue a level below me come up on my druid while I was at half health, but Faerie Fire + Bear got me to survive and kill him.  I kept moving in the zone but I still was found, killed by the rogue in his second try and then corpse camped while being told to go to retail.  
---
No I idea what their malfunction is.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
---
All unusable when I get stunned/feared at half health or less farming mobs...or am I missing something
---
Imagine being a hunter and saying rogue is braindead class , lmao.
---
I rarely played with warlocks, the class seems underrepresented. I guess most people went for a shadow priest instead since the general recommendation was to play a healer if you want groups. I was thinking about a warlock because of that as well, but I hate managing a pet :D.
---
I have some imperial plate bracers and boots now on 295. Guy in Tanaris gives them for turning in thorium. Do I have to learn all of his recipes and then i have Q available in Orgrimmar?

#NOCHANGES
---
Twinking @ lv60
---
1: identify someone in IRL is actually not allowed. It against the EULA. Now some corps have overstepped those boundaries.
---
 but just digging throug your in game full history of economic transactions and game time and in game contacts / channels etc incl your reputation.  
---
Example if you tell me you only have this account but I can see transactions to another account I‚Äôm getting  Suspicious.  If I see communication with known leadership in opposing alliances it‚Äôs a red flag. 
---
We ran a auth script on a player gathering all of intel and if the questions don‚Äôt match answers we reject 
---
Then we had to check your name vs alliance blacklist.  
---
Another example if your new and the character is very streamlined towards one path we get very suspicious as no new player know what they want to do.   
---
Joining a Corp in eve is about handing over your history and then talk to them answering there questions.  Having a player vouch for you means you can bypass most of it. 
---
Everyone gets screened 
---
I think my Corp had a expectancy to join 2 fleets /month (we set it to 4/2mo ). Logistics ppl was excluded from that so I‚Äôm not sure. 
---
We held training courses for new players so they can follow directions in big fleets.  
---
See it like we required you to join two raids every month.  With 20+ fleets /day it‚Äôs not hard to meet.
---
I can't check the video now, but come on. Don't be usch an ass-hat about it. Give constructive feedback if any. Jikes.
---
Bold Statment. 
---
Gold is the building block in which you're able to supply your guild with the proper consumables. Whether it be classic or retail, without gold, there usually is no guild.
---
Nazona baby, it‚Äôs ownage time sweetheart.
---
Blaumaux?
---
It's MEANT to trigger you, I don't think they care if they seem craven to you.
---
Took a lil longer than I expected but yeah, here we are
---
All those sources are wrong. There's a reason why everyone is farming essence of water instead of essence of air / earth. Essence of water has a much better drop rate.
---
About 50 runs in after getting swords/ring...seen truestrike once..yet to get em.  Feel like all I do on WoW is run UBRS.
---
What
---
Bet someone tricked him in to being the wielder of Nightfall, RIP.
---
Clearly it's instance dependent, but I've been able to keep the tank up long enough for dps to corpse run, as well as I've been able to walk back out the door.
---
That is Shadra, spider loa, from Hinterlands.
---
In BfA we meet another Shadra in Zandalar.
---
As a paladin I always throw out a might or wisdom buff to people I see on the road immediately. If they don't give me an int/mark/fort buff then I just switch my pally buff to the wrong one as they fade out of range. It may be petty, but I'm not in the business of helping randoms that don't care enough to press a single button in return lmao.
---
yup:)
---
If people are willing to pay for a good tank for fast runs (or because they cant find any), THEY will let YOU know, not the other way around.
---
You could absolutely make some money doing that, if you offer yourself as such in chat or just form your own groups with f.e. "orbs reserved". But dont go around asking random pugs for an invite but have them funnel all the loot to you because you're "carrying" them, that would be similar as if a war/rogue joined a random brd lava run and asked if they would reserve hoj for him as he promises to top the dps charts.
---
Nope, in both occasions they will only group up to gank horde players
---
Priest leveling is like butter after around 25ish once you have all your early talent points in place.  It‚Äôs awfully mindless though.  Big opener, dot, wand.  Reapply big, reapply dot, wand....  but there‚Äôs practically zero downtime 1v1 grinding out in the field.
---
Get an auction add-on. Send 5g (whatever you can spare really) to a bank-alt. Start buying stuff cheap on the AH sundays and mondays and sell back stuff on the AH right after raid resets or thursdays/fridays. 
---
This is the way to really make money in classic.
---
Pre raid daggers suck, so yes.
---
Hit 30 on PVE got a little bored, rerolled RP-PVP, nearly 20, loving it!
---
&gt; others are scripting the other with a 3rd party program
---
Proof? Or are you just salty someone clicked the macro faster than you?
---
So if i give my friends to the trainer i will get a mount + skill ?ü§î
---
I barely had enough gold at 40 for my mount. Two weeks later and I'm in my 50s and have 300g and I gave my druid friend 70g so he could get his mount. Herb/skinning for professions and I don't farm anything. The gold just starts flowing in like crazy when you get into the late 40s/early 50s.

I won a roll for a chest with 35 the other day, it felt weird.
---
Thanx mate. I digged around the talent calculator looking for places where the shield talents might yield a bit more and while it was not possible to go with the dodge suggestion (as this need 10 points in the tree to become available) what seems possible is to shift points needed in the tree (20 points) for the adv windfury away from the shield to get 2 seconds shorter grounding totem cooldown, which might make larger difference in pvp settings (and in some dungeons) than 2% higher block chance and 10% more damage blocked. 
---
This is what I have atm as a long term plan - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-50202321500201-05035051005013
---
Yeah, they will just go to the american server and start speaking only russian. 
---
they will think about it as an exchange...or a revenge...
---
&gt;Gold is worth 10x more now than it will be
---
Who cares? What do you need to actually buy RIGHT now that wont be cheaper in the long run. 
---
Consumables will only go down in the next few months or until people get gear and want to parse in MC. You have MONTHS to craft any BiS pieces you want before BWL comes out(but you dont even really need em). If you're gathering then you should go ahead and sell it for an epic mount to make more money in the long run. 
---
So what's the point of keeping it in the bank?
---
Well sure, you cant mage polymorph the demons, but did you try fearing one instead? /s
---
VC
---
Slightly...at 60-40, horde have 150% as many people as alliance.  That‚Äôs not slightly.
---
Let‚Äôs address some facts here because your comment is some serious twisting of those facts. 
---
Sylvanas kills a siege tower and a handful of mooks in that Lordaeron Cinematic. Hardly a tall order for a faction leader. ..And the Orgrimmar cutscene, striking, has nothing to do with the Lordaeron.
---
Don't pretend to be naive, it's a waste of time.
---
I am not the one crying here am providing you with solutions to your problem
---
"Before violent videogames"? Uh... What rock have you lived under? Doom and Mortal Kombat, two of the most controversial violent video games ever were both released long before Vanilla.
---
Just buy it.  If you were to farm it, you could sell the recipe for that value anyways.  Its the same amount of gold either way. 
---
One is just paying gold now. Other is the opportunity cost of the selling the drop. 
---
Perfect example is the top comments story - he could have just turned around and sold the enchant pattern for 200g himself.  He is still out 200g either way. Maybe more if he could have increased the price on AH with his recipe - buy at 200g, sell at 250g, all depends on supply and demand.
---
Just skillfully mount your friends!
---
*Is the lyceum in BRD possible without a mage?* I'm a level 55 tank, my healer is 54 and I have a dps friends that refuses to group with mages. I've yet to successful do lyceum without a mage because I simply can't hold aggro for very long on groups that big.
---
I know mages aren't the only aoe class. I get that. But a fury warrior can't trap/slow. It's not like he can hamstring every single one of them, and that's what I'm worried about.
---
i dont think they stun me.... im fresh 40 so i have all leather so they open with ambush and then just nuke me down since i cant get away from them. i could have a chance with some poison remove and wing clip proc
---
you wish. Im a prot pally lvl 45 and i drop a consecrate and if does not tick 2-3 times at least 2-3 mobs lose aggro. Its impossible to hit at everything before blizzard does
---
Those that weren't listed in the forum post about single layer servers, presumably.
---
I played paladin for six years and it was a mistake. Eleresto is different because it's a genuine hybrid so you get to play both offence and support.
---
One could simply surmise that since you cropped out your level, and aren‚Äôt displaying the mob level, and and you gave no description of the scenario, that you... Well I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious.
---
dang hope we have that luck this week. almost no mage loot so far for us
---
Are you basing that off your own experience with being a basement dweller? I wouldn't think you would see many of these basement dwellers outside of basements.
---
But Lordaeron still belongs to the people of Lordaeron, undead yes, but still.
---
PC humans are Stormwind humans.
---
The real gold came from the interests
---
And there is none when the guild manipulates DKP in order to give their friends loot, which is the equivalent of what you just listed.  Both are just as ridiculous
---
Yeah, pretty sure I'll get CoC to max, but I'm still &lt;20 so Fire Blast is my go-to execute spell atm. Even later on, the range of Fire Blast and the fact I don't have to aim it, just hit the button, mob dies; I'll probably spend the coin to level it.
---
Alright, gimme a break it's been a while since I saw it. Haven't actually played BFA. I just remember her death god powers practically thrashing an entire army while she left with nary a scratch.
---
Honestly how do you fuck up a fast food order that bad though? I used to work fast food it isn't that hard
---
What seems to be the officer, problem?

I want to know this too.
---
I just hit 41 on my paladin ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/050501-053221330101](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/050501-053221330101)  Consecration and Blessing of Sanctuary are the main points, move others freely), and I can do 8-10 melee mobs of lvl 37-39 in one pull, drink and repeat (which gives about 1/70 of my level per pull in xp, so not bad). If I'm questing I usually try to pull 3-5 mobs instead of doing them one by one. There are more effective ways like reckbombing, but I dislike the hassle it brings and just prefer to pull and let the passive damage do it's thing. Works fine for me but the real problem is finding good aoe spots that are not contested. Unlike mage, you will want mobs that do not run away at low health so at least you're not competing with them as they prefer humanoids for the better drops at that level range (or atleast to my knowledge, never touched a mage).
---
He tries attacking you from behind, you can use your pet's stun / wrath. He'll vanish. This means you are out of combat and you can put on freeze trap. This will freeze him if he runs stupidly after you. Activate track hidden. Mark him if possible.  Start running horizontally and concussive shot him. If he gets in this cycle = dead.
---
/point /laugh
---
So now we need to update everyones bis lists?
---
Interesting.  Thanks for that.

What's the resolution of your monitor? That will affect what screen resolution you can get to, not your video card.

im not crying, im asking for strategy on killing a rogues

[Blue Post](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update-english/92241) here mentions that the following servers have one layer:
---
* Bloodfang
---
* Dragonfang
---
* Earthshaker
---
* Hydraxian Waterlords
---
* Judgement
---
* Ten Storms
---
So I assume every other server has multiple layers still. Apparently layered servers will be soon be indicated in realm select
---
Probably just trolling you. You said ‚Äúpicard‚Äù not Picard, yet he still knew you were referring to a person. I would assume he thought it would be obvious.
---
Ironic guild name then xD

An almost-BIS (-3? Healing from the true BIS) wand dropped for md from a Snapjaws during that quest.

Are those all bank alts?!?

With that logic you should sit out all melee on shazzrah and bring in 12 other ranged dps

&gt; I have a dps friends that refuses to group with mages.
---
What about you ask him to cut the bullshit? I mean yeah it can be done very painfully without a mage (take a warlock instead) but seriously, wtf is wrong with this guy?
---
Well people usually don't release until the healer dies.  
---
And even if the dps die and you (and the tank) make it to the exit alive you didn't gain that much. You still didn't kill the group/boss and you still have to wait for people to do the corpse run.    
---
Of course it's satisfying to see dps die because of their dumb actions while you survive, but in the end you're just slowing the whole group down by letting those people die.
---
Agree with this , But we were killing snapjaws.
---
Prot Warrior who‚Äôs profession is enchanting.  I had to borrow 30g to get my mount at44.

That's how multiple sources and videos describe the mechanic. And it seems to align with what's happening in practice if you pay attention to the threat meter - she will always go down the list and fireball #1, then #2 etc.
---
It probably has a lot to do with how fast you do P2.

A few days ago some dude tried to make a group for some dungeon and locked specific items. Some other player was like "locking items in Classic? What a retard". I replied to him with "nobody is forced to join a dungeon group. Don't like the rules, don't join". He replied with some impeccable logic: "then make a group with players who don't need those items, idiot" and immediately ignored me.
---
Like he is insulting others for doing pretty much exactly what he wants them to do, except they are saying "mage item locked", instead of "LFM no mages".
---
Sorry but, if the sword is worth 100 gold in the first place, it means that lot‚Äôs of people are needing it, and potentially by one person in the group that should not have to pay 100 gold for it. The lvl 19 sword is the example for a twink, for an item that will useless 5 lvl after, but let‚Äôs talk about a warden staff for example. If the staff is dropped during a dungeon, why should a Druid tank not have it, as it will be the BiS ever regarding mitigation? You can argue that it will be sold, but in that case I can argue that I can disenchant dal rend main hand for a better price that the x gold provided by the vendor, sell the Reagent at the AH, and therefore make more money. 
---
In that case, where is the limit? The price amount? The fact that it‚Äôs a boe?
---
Personally, I‚Äôll roll ‚Äúgreed‚Äù if it‚Äôs for money. For me the term is self explicit.
---
There is a risk that a ninja takes the item by rolling need but eh! I‚Äôll take that risk
---
I've tried a few, I've heard that hunter might be the best for me but I didn't really enjoy it that much.

Blizzard are trying to encourage people to join the low pop servers, so I don't think it'll be happening anytime soon unfortunately.
---
Classic wow feels like a perfect balance of a carefully crafted premium experience and one that doesn't hold your hand, leaving you with lots of things to discover. I think I might be addicted.
---
80% of the experience imo is to not use addons and try to limit the use of searching online for solutions.
---
Highly recommend it.
---
Disc is always viable for leveling and dungeons. However when it comes to raids, bosses will outlive your mana-bar no matter how much spellpower you stack. And there isn't enough mp5 gear in the whole Classic content to keep your dps up. So in raids Priests are never viable for dps.
---
So until level 60 go full shadow talent tree and respex when I hit 60 then?
---
Hunters mark counters their stealth doesn't it? Just put it on them as a warning
---
How is the addon called next to your unitframe?

What's the best way to have decent Destruction Warlock gear as someone who's not a minmaxer and can't nolife too much?
---
I just want to pvp as destro (conflag) but it seems like I have to max Tailoring and have the most expensive gear and be raiding 247 to keep up, and even then, it will become obsolete in a month with the next phase once I finally have it.
---
E.g I got excited that there's a cheapish alternative to Robe of the Void (Winter Night) but saw it's only shadow damage.
---
Advice pls?
---
But Forsaken are Lordaeron people lul.
---
Honestly they've had it coming for a while now..
---
ƒ∞ have only 4 flasks left. ƒ∞ have all potions, elixirs and 1 flask recipe. Only 4 left and i will buy them when i got enough money, meanwhile, i will farm for it. ƒ∞ have to farm some gold to buy it either way so i am gonna farm money in potential flask drop zones so i will have a chance to drop it while making money to buy it.
---
this marked as humor cuz it didnt happen?
---
All minions despawn when they go out of combat with their master dead, it sometimes happens to imps randomly as soon as master dies tho.
---
you and me both xD
---
Sure, but the point is that you, as the tank, are often in the lead. You make the pulls, you take the heat, you set the pace. So of course, you also need to communicate. Whether you like it or not, you are the leader.
---
However you do not want your pet passively sitting there while you fight. If you‚Äôre using your succubus she does approximately 25% of your damage. Just turn off her abilities and only casts them when she has full mana and you‚Äôre not using dark pact
---
Probably just a regular person tbh. I've played league and overwatch with some 'acquaintances' from a university club and despite being put together and chilled in real life, they regularly say nonsensical toxic crap in-game when they're tilted. Some people just use gaming as an emotional outlet rather than recreation.
---
Trans goes for 5-10g on my server. Never seen higher than that.
---
I feel it dude, but maybe don‚Äôt argue points you can‚Äôt defend.
---
They can't but the AH works well
---
Sorry--I don't watch streamers. But can you try and keep this "Picard" off of my server?
---
I wanna be on your realm, dps here goes full big dick dps as soon as my arrow leaves my bow, mages be like los or counterspell never heard of that nonsence and just facetank ranged mobs.
---
Grab a guildy or group up with local players.
---
Your ‚Äúanti-social‚Äù thought process is ridiculous for a game centered around fighting for valuable resources.
---
&gt;I am extrenely experienced at playing warrior, and we had a good group.
---
If you were extremely experienced, you would have waited till 44 to run it...
---
Nobody has a PvP trinket right now; so prep is completely broken and you can 1v1 and often 2v1 pretty reliably especially if you get a sap. The amount of time you can CC someone for with prep is just perverse.
---
If you need to raid and also pvp then you'll have to go seal fate but isn't as good at either pve or pvp with current gear. Its the only real compromise spec. Personally I am combat daggers atm so I'm not competing against all the sword users in my raid and I want first Perdition's blade. I'm doing comparable damage to the PvE sword rogues and am slightly better in PvP thanks to imp sprint, but not having prep is a big deal - adrenaline rush is not as useful.
---
Is it possible to solo them as a Shaman or is stealth necessary to skip the packs?
---
It does though. 
---
As a dps war you may just have to wait longer for your group.  Both of your bullets are assumptions not facts.  While ‚Äòb)‚Äô is accurate that tanks can find a group easy.  ‚Äòa)‚Äô is just dumb.  Speaking by as a tank, I‚Äôve never thought less of someone dpsing just because their class is capable of tanking.
---
As a shadow priest grouping makes drinking become a thing, no one leaves the kbs so I never get spirit tap so it feels like it's slowing me down even if it's not.
---
Yeah thanks for last hitting that mob, I didnt need that spirit tap anyway :'(
---
Update:  
---
Went to TSM's discord and found out how to get their name. Just returned it to em. They posted it for 26s instead of 26g, but they tipped 5g, so hey I'm up 15x and they're not down 26g

You'll see something pop up on top of their head when they switch stances. Also you can tell by the buffs/debuffs they have
---
the last message was a lost opportunity for "tank and spank"
---
Also low level leather isn't going to sell much.  It is the leather towards endgame you'll make money from.
---
1. its not working in bfa
---
2. why dont you create a lvl1, delete him, create another with the same name and test?
---
I had skinning on my mage - got some profit from devilsaur leather at around 6-7g per piece, got even one pristine hide of the beast, skinned some leather for runecloth bags, got few core leather from MC and that's about it. Had to drop it for tailoring and the epic chest. Likely mining gave me more money (and that's without selling arcane crystals).
---
Np. One thing I wish I did was to make a huge list of quests and items I needed from each dungeon and to do them in order to reach 60. I ended up having to go back to BRD to do onyxia attunements at 60 for example which is pretty inefficient. Try to get everything in brd done by level 58-59 and move onto lbrs
---
Votekick him.....you are the tank...
---
What class are you?
---
Before you get all up in arms..... I had just hit level 44 and had enough gold to go buy my mount and hop on the zeppelin to go to UC to get my skills (which is where the screenshot takes place).
---
I hadn‚Äôt bought skills since level 30 so that is what the 24 gold was for. Most of the skills were 2-3g and I still didn‚Äôt have enough for all of them.
---
I wasn‚Äôt being greedy, I have just been frugal with my money so that I could get everything in one fell swoop. 
---
I didnt think 24g was a lot all things considered.
---
If a dps takes agrro it's usually the dps fault, there is no real reason to do a dps race, it is way more efficient to kill mobs with focused dps unless you spell cleave. Let the warrior die, don't even answer him. After 2-3 time he will attack only one mob at a time I promise you
---
You‚Äôll be wanting more stats for PvP imo spell damage is talked about for warlocks often, but it tends to be in a PvE environment where you‚Äôre relatively safe and your HP isn‚Äôt at risk. I would say Int and Stamina are definitely what you want , taking spell damage where you can. 
---
Shadow damage is still good for a destro lock also! Corruption and Shadowbolt benefit from it not to mention shadow burn and drain life. You‚Äôll be using a good mix of fire and shadow damage as a Lock in any situation , and 40 damage is hard to pass up if you can get your hands on Winters.
---
funnily enough, so does your print screen button.
---
Not that you seem to know
---
Its so easy to keep track of. 0 effort at all.
---
How is that false? It's very common to use DKP based system and still give maintank to prio everything he needs.
---
Seems like you have a great hold on your class already. Find some friends in game with similar PvP goals and practice duels with them. Grouping for fights in contested zones will help your teamwork as well. Basically, treat PvP like you do PvE, practice your role and you‚Äôll do great.
---
Thinking you have such great memory and cannot remember anything wrong ?
---
I did it kinda like this :
---
I started off as a shadow/disc hybrid until 40. I got up to Mind Flay from the Shadow tree and put the rest of the points in Disc. Then I respecced into deep shadow, getting my shadow form, and then I put more points into disc again. At around 52, I started to feel the need to respec to holy, but I decided against it, and just grinded quests and mobs my way to 58, while healing some early BRD runs just fine. After hitting 58 I just respecced started to heal dungeons as a holy. I actually got my level 60 from finishing my Onyxia attunement, and had big portion of my pre-bis done while doing so.
---
This is my first time playing wow myself, and I play rs on and off still.
---
I'm currently loving wow.
---
Rs is a game that's literally just "grinding the game." Now you're gunna say "every mmo is grindy" but rs is king. It's the type of game you have going on in the background while you afk on some skills to level them. Now I'm not ripping on rs, cuz like I said I play it myself here and there, just stating how I feel about it.
---
Wow is much more hands on, and is much different in terms of its grind. Wow also has a much better social scene, as you need to group up for dungeons, raids, and sometimes even quests that require you to kill elites (or go into quest zones your class alone can't handle.) 
---
What I say to do is buy a month of wow, and see how you feel about it. Sure its subscription costs a little more, but again, it's much more hands on. It can't hurt to test it out as it's something new, since you said you've played rs before so you already have an idea with that game.

I saw someone named Jagoff and he wasn't even from Pittsburgh smh
---
awesome thanks!
---
Mage is overall the best pvp class with a lot of default wins like warrior, hunter, rogues wihtout cds.
---
so the question is who can beat a mage, with 2-3 iceblocks in 3 duels. 
---
Shadow and warlocks are good in 1v1 but mages can burn them down pretty good while they have a hard time doing dmg against shield/iceblock/silence/wotf.
---
I would bet on a mage. Easiest and best class to play and win in pvp
---
Hey Guildie :D
---
There was a time you couldn't whisper people you had on ignore, I miss those days.
---
Is it better to solo quest your way up as something like arms or fury or is it more viable to play as prot tank and dungeon grind your way up? Or should you just keep tank gear in the bank and just dungeon grind while arms or fury?
---
Atleast keep it to 60, your at thick and soon rugged leather which both sell for double vendor price in trade chat or AH. Between 43 and 60 yourll probably get atleast 60-100g just from passive skinning whenever you kill a beast.
---
Ahah yes that's a thing, but I trained myself to time the final Mind Blast for the last hit. Years of dota paid off
---
Those people should be kicked from group.
---
My bad.  
---
You clearly generate more threat by /sit.
---
Reserving dalrends is too common so people don't even bother to joke about it. But reserving baron mount? Time to pull out our "MC all loot reserved" macros.
---
For what race? What??
---
Great, really glad I made this post. I'll be doing some research today before I get back into WoW and figure out all I need to do!
---
Yep, always on that channel
---
I got tailoring and engineering for my professions as a warlock first time playing, and engineering feels really useless for me atm.
---
Should I just switch to skinning/herbalism and then get engineering back when im 60 and PVPing?
---
It usually takes some CD but I just try and read the nova and blinks. Try my best to dump them with cold+evis to spike them out. I pick lowering their armor over garrote though.

I've come to the general understanding that prntscrn is a myth to many people.

It‚Äôs not going to recover to another account.  The most you could for would be it restores that toon on your account and forces a name change.

---
I say this, now I am suddenly making some money enchanting.   I guess you just have to log in when the other enchanters are asleep.
---
Imagine using a Picard meme without knowing who Picard is...
---
I don't think so. There are just more than 3:1 dps to tank ratio.
---
There are many talents that work based on taking crits/spell crits, so it's not irrelevant information.
---
Yea i can see where that is a problem, and in classic i do appreciate a good group, i really do. But it seems finding/forming a group is a hassle.
---
Go disc/holy and heal dungeons all the way to 60, inbetween runs just dot and wand mobs around your level. If you just wanna grind for a few hours, grind the satyrs in felwood, you will want there demonic runes anyway for raids.
---
I was cut from an elite questing group in the hinterlands yesterday by a mage leader who complained about my healing when for the last 20 pulls I asked him for water and he refused to give me any. Keep in mind no one ever died. The worst part is I had 3 mobs left to kill out of an 80 MOB QUEST when he did this. Luckily a level 60 came through and I begged him to help me finish for 5g and he didn‚Äôt even want the money. Jesus walks, and he‚Äôs a level 60 rogue and the devil is a 47 mage in the hinterlands.
---
Engineering is going to be really expensive without mining.  what level are you?
---
Both are great games. Been having a lot of fun playing both. I've played OSRS for the past like 4 years and still have so much stuff to do so the pros of that is so much content. Another thing about osrs is there is a lot to learn about the game so many different ways to level skills up and play the game as a whole. There's also a lot of things to do in RuneScape where it's really afk, like you click a few times every few minutes or so and wow does not really have that. 
---
The cons of RuneScape will be gameplay and graphics, its combat is not as active as wow and graphics while it's charming some people can't stand them. It's a little difficult to get hooked on it just cause it can be really overwhelming at first and there is zero hand holding, once you do the tutorial it literally just plops you down in the main world and that's it. Biggest issue that RuneScape has though is for sure the botting, since it's such a simple game it's really easy to not and get away with it. there will be many times where you see so many people fishing or woodcutting and none of them will be real people.
---
Ever since classic launched I've been playing both, I've had a big afk grind to do in RuneScape so I've just been doing that while leveling on classic. They are both really fun MMOs with a lot of grinding to keep you busy. The only way to know which one you will like more is to just try them both out I would say sub to wow for a month and see how you like it, then get a month of membership on RuneScape and see what happens.
---
So thats a no
---
Join a guild with a schedule that is convenient for you. I mean consistency in clearing the raids with the same people and you know they will clear it. The pug may or may not and may take significantly longer
---
Really great to have a feral dps join the 5 man too. Tank dies? Bear form. Healer dies or goes oom? Switch to heals.
---
History will repeat itself.  
---
The realms with balanced A:H ratio will be stable for aslong as people want to fight.  
---
The other realms that have a huge faction imbalance will just start dying and it will be boring as hell.
---
A lot of people that joined pvp servers and don't want to pvp are just gonna transfer or quit game.
---
Hunter, Priest, Warlock, druid. These all are quite strong at leveling. Some dont really get strong until 10-20.
---
Hmmm that logic can be applied to your comment. What a dumbass hypocrite ü§î
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
To tank 5-mans at 60 you absolutely must have the Holy Shield talent. Technically the DDs could just wait for a few seconds till you got your aggro managed, but realistically they will be on the mob 5 seconds before you decided which group to pull.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVuoxZVhxIxzVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVVuoxZVhxIxzVo)
---
This would be a good Tank/Heal hybrid spec. You loose a bit of crit, but other than that you should be fine with the healing. For tanking you loose the parry and some extra dps, but you should still be fine for most groups.
---
I‚Äôll say 1/29/21 if you do more pvp. 1 point in entrangling root can be very useful
---
You open with anything other than cheap shot in pvp? Why?
---
Could work if you played the ‚Äúaccidentally deleted‚Äù angle.
---
Thank you! I started a warrior alt recently and thought I was losing my mind when everything auto-replaced.
---
Grind sartyrs. either in felwood or azshara. Demonic runes ftw. Be warned thou, theres usually lvl 60s farming there. if you plan on grinding anything during primtime hours, then dungoens are your only choice.
---
I played RS from 2004-2006, then i started wow and have never returned to RS since. Thats your answer.
---
Why is it against the ToS?
---
Huh.  Never noticed.
---
those numbers in any order is like 1 in 100 million.  Far lower chance than any drop rate in the game.
---
There's a lot of should out there. Wool shouldnt be sold at the same price as silk but on mankirk it goes for more than silk.
---
Pretty sure he meant that pallys fuck up rogues in pvp. Because they do. Pallys are hella underrated.
---
&gt;I only play PVE
---
So camping Broken Tooth was near pointless
---
If you meet a really good frost mage , your chances without engineering 300, subtelty spec and a couple of free action potions are close to zero.
---
Taking into account both of you have all cooldowns, he has coldsnap you have preparation, 2 blinds, 2 sprints, 2 vanishes, iron grenades which stun , frost/fire reflector trinkets, free action potions are element of surprise and the edge usually if you bait his first iceblock with this.. It is a match of exhausting his two iceblocks as soon as possible. Ofcourse, the skill ceiling in such a matchup is through the roof and hard to execute, many things can go wrong. I feel it is a very interesting fight.
---
Same for me. My guess is that rude player are "optimizing" their leveling by spamming dungeon, so we don't see them as much if we are not spamming dungeon too.

I remember seeing a horde member getting mobbed as I was sneaking(feral druid) through a valley, and I popped up out of nowhere, helped him and we parted ways.
---
My guess is because you lost in a fight and some people just really suck at losing. They feel inferior and try to justify that they lost by being like "Oh it was not a fair fight, 1v1 i would stomp you" if you then win 1v1 they go like "You bought so much gear!". There will always be another reason they lost that is not their fault.

Keep in mind, this is definitely not all people. But those who are like that are a loud minority.

Gotta macro it, you will still be in combat if your pet is still attacking, they resist the feign, or if your serpent sting dot ticks.

It was like that on both servers I played on.

Actually, they sit there afk but never go afk. If I fear them away from the vendor they stay wherever the fear ends and never go afk. Something is running to keep them in game for several hours.

Always depends on how long you keep the weapon and how much gold you have. If you get it right at 30 and keep it until level 48 for the gatorbite axe that would be a better investment than for example a fury warrior who farms for krol blade and can replace it right on his first raid
---
Look up Prot Paladin GBOK spam. It's something the Prot Pally community recently discovered. Makes threat trivial to hold.
---
Because a mage just blinks your cheapshot and you basically did zero damage... His blink is also on a very low cooldown...
---
I'd assume this is heavily influenced by whether the druid is willing to farm Gnomeregan for the consumable 50% attack speed buff. I doubt even a DW warrior would keep up with that, but I might be wrong of course.
---
It was merely a joke aimed a the current news debate, I did not think anyone would take it seriously.
---
I cant stop laughing ü§£
---
It's fair if you don't need any other gear from strat live. Otherwise why would you do it?
---
I quit my main (which was only level 32) and gifted my entire 30gs before deleting my toon to a NE hunter level 39 who was shy 20 gold of her mount
---
I asked in guild how do I get to badlands and a lock sent me an invite and a summons like a minute later
---
got lucky lol
---
Either 1) don't invite them or 2) go DPS also and only pop Defensive and a couple of sunders if elite goes for your healer.
---
At least that's how I do it. Only go serious tank mode /w shield when you get to a spicy boss, like Magmus and Emperor in BRD.
---
Killed onyxia twice in like 10 trys total, only saw the breath once and it seems tht landed where it shouldnt have...
---
James T Kirk.
---
I lent 33g to a guy from my guild. He said befor that he didnt enjoy the game too much (leveling a warrior) and I thought a little pony might make the experience more enjoyable. 
---
He was glad and leveled on (at least that is what i thought) until some day I get a message with 30g enclosed saying something like "Hey im gonna send you your gold but its 3g missing because that is all I have and i dont want to play this game anymore"
---
So by offering him the gold I made him play the game he didnt like even to a point where he just played to repay the gold. As I got more than enough gold I told him all the time that I didnt care but I guess his pride was too high.
---
sry for rambling
---
Some guildies had planned to farm the blue dragon sinew in WinterSpring for hunter weapon quest, I'd got there early and was basically AFK close enough to the Dragonkin, but in a safe spot.  I'm a Gnome Warlock.
---
A Hunter wandered over and asked if I was doing the Eye quest.  "No, just waiting for my friends... they should be here by now." She asked if these friends were imaginary, or demonic, etc... I realized she was RPing.  Now we ARE on an RP-PVP server but it still kinda caught me off guard (such is the state of my server, a bunch of people joined to avoid PvP server queues)...
---
Anyway I had no idea what this Eye quest was, so I did a quick Google and realized it's the Onyxia chain.  Suddenly a switch flicked in my brain and I'm thinking like a Gnome.  All the voice lines from all the quests, I'm imagining myself speak in a squeaky, happy go lucky voice.
---
"Oh, you're looking for Haleh!?" I asked.  
---
\- I might be, what's it to you?  
---
"I know a short cut!"  
---
\- Sounds... dangerous.  
---
"No, no, Perfectly Safe!  Just a quick run up an ice covered mountain. Perfectly Safe!"
---
I led her up the (wrong, lol) mountain.  Got the 'You have discovered' message.  
---
\- You look lost, Gnome.  
---
"All these ice covered mountains look the same, but I'm pretty sure I haven't been here before.  Wrong mountain!"  
---
\- No kidding.  
---
"Perfectly Safe!"
---
On we went.  Found the right mountain.  I showed her the jump (took me about 20 tries hah).    
---
\- Performance Issues?  
---
"Perfectly Safe!" 
---
The whole mini-event lasted maybe 30 minutes.  It was great fun.  It doesn't happen very often since everyone is either rushing to 60, stuck in dungeons for pre-BiS, or rushing their alts to 60.  But when it does happen, I'm really really glad I rolled RP-PVP.
---
I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret.  This dude has NOTHING positive to say in any of his comment history.  Just a sad pathetic mouthbreather.  I wouldn‚Äôt even use the word troll, it would be an insult to the actual trolls on Reddit.
---
Ummm.... Classic WoW very much holds your hand.
---
Less damage means fewer mobs, the objective iw to maximize time hitting a mob not killing them.
---
We get it, you were not loved as a child.
---
HAHAHA serves him right.
---
I actually ran from gnomeregan to badlands.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs faster but it‚Äôs a option. Also very few alliance on the way (mostly low levels)
---
True, but for a ranged insta-cast nuke I still think Fire Blast is worth having key-bound.
---
Back of envelop calc's @ lvl60:
---
CoC R5 = 353 ave dmg + 6% Piercing Ice = 374.18 + 35% imp CoC = 505.143 &amp; 555 mana
---
FB R7 = 485 ave dmg + 10% Fire Power = 533.5 &amp; 340 mana
---
I don't think there are enough pt's to have both imp CoC &amp; Fire Power (&amp; I've ignored crits, Winters Chill, Imp Scorch, etc), but even if you spec deep frost, the dpm for R7 Fire Blast without extras = 1.42
---
which is better than a fully pimped CoC = 0.91
---
So yeah, as a mage, even if I go deep frost, I'll still invest in Fire Blast, because I'm a mage, not a frost mage; those came later.
---
Damn man, I wish I had more time to play.
---
Been playing almost every day since release, and i'm only at 7 days /played D:
---
Lucky I picked Hunter so i'm level 57.
---
A totally random person saw me running on foot at level 40 and asked how much gold I needed for my mount. I literally only need 1g and was running to a new quest zone to try and farm it out. He/She instantly traded me 2g and once I had a bit to spare I sent back the 2g.  I know its only 2g, and I didn't pay back more, but it was still a random person, giving someone gold for their mount.
---
I truly appreciated it and I hope to be able to pay it forward in the future.
---
That's pretty much all of classic PvP is not balanced but its wicked fun
---
It's literally currency because it is tradable for currency!  Its the exact same as if 300g dropped instead if the pattern itself. Things that are exchangable are worth the same. A boe is worth the same to everyone. It's not BiS bop gear that's dropping, it's a pile of money.  I'm not giving the mage 300g just to save him a trip to the AH. Same with any other boe blues and purples.  'Not hsving to spend money on it' is greed to! Because there is an alternative, buying it yourself. BoP gear doesn't have an alternative means of acquiring.
---
And that mage who rolled on the Chief's Enforcer (melee staff with a stun proc).
---
Shouldn't have said anything after it dropped for better effect.
---
Completely reasonable. Reserve whatever you want provided you can get people who still want to do the run.
---
Reserve too much and you'll look dumb, but there's no real harm in trying.
---
Technically, they are the same odds of rolling any other set of numbers.
---
Nah I'm not doing the grind again, I'd rather take a break for a couple of months or however long it takes for them to add transfers.
---
Shit was absolutely wretched
---
Because tanks are in high demand and he can.
---
On one hand i really like those posts, always nice to have your SO try your game.   
---
On the other it makes me incredibly jealous since i am having serious trouble finding someone suitable for me :(.
---
In fact "Wanker" is a very common name in the region where I come from.
---
There are a lot of "Wankers" I know. One of this family even did go to Hollywood and composed music for "Buffy the vampire slayer".
---
Due problems he got in USA with his name he has a pseudonym, "Wander".
---
I don't get it why people having this name for generations should suddenly change their names. The obsession with simple words in this culture is crazy snowflake stuff.
---
Words are never a problem and a culture that tries to control words is a not a little bit crazy, this culture has a massive problem with maturity.
---
People who insist on "watching the language" are a real problem and must be shown their limits in a world that is more as the small horizon those people can imagine.
---
It was never the words that were bad and it will never be the words.
---
It is what's in the mind of the brain that condems words.
---
Oh that's why he's mad.
---
rage from a druid: you cannot retalent at the Mopnglade druid trainer!!! have to take a flight to Thunder Bluff for that. literally unplayable
---
&gt;I get that. But a fury warrior can't trap/slow.
---
Could you spec into piercing howl?  I haven't dabbled with tanking yet in classic (but tanked a lot from TBC and on), that ability might be useful for the lyceum.
---
Google search jigaboo my friend
---
Jig is short
---
Yeah that much I can believe but I'm saying OPs post is really pushing it
---
Week 1: So?
---
Week 2: Literal fantasyland. Healers and Priests are a dime a dozen in classic and not difficult to find. A lack of free water in the leveling process wouldn't matter anyhow.
---
Week 6: LMAO. I generally don't respond nor do I think anyone is selfish for trying.
---
This post is so weird.
---
I leveled engineering without mining. Until you get to thorium it's actually really cheap.
---
BiS lists are for the maximum DPS for raid encounters. They assume you are using the best mana potions, demonic runes, and other consumables every pull. Downrank if you are still running out of mana after all of that. If everyone has the prebis suggested the boss will take significantly less time to kill compared to people stacking int gear and mana will be less of an issue.
---
PVP is a different beast entirely and BiS lists are completely tuned for PVE. Stam is a major stat in PVP while you get more than enough from raid buffs in PVE.
---
Everything he said is correct except the word double. You don‚Äôt get double the drops. Your quest drops are no longer being split between two people.
---
Do both, spec arms/fury for questing and slap a shield on when you run dungeons. You can still tank, no need to be specced.
---
I can walk by a few packs while not stealth-ed,  if you were will to wait for patrols you could also skips some stuff as a shaman but in the upper hall way, i am not sure how you would pass those packs without stealth as their aggro  range is pretty much the entire width,  I also skip one of the 6 trolls as he just heals way to much. Only way to find out is to try,

Are you sure Windwanker is allowed?
---
Bop is tradable for currency too. Just much less. You‚Äôre showing your greed by admitting it‚Äôs simply the amount of gold that you can exchange it for that you seem to think makes it ok to take another classes BiS. Pathetic really.
---
Pretty sure my friend and I just met guy called Turbonegro - apparently that is fine too
---
Pre-bis is a pve thing.
---
Yeah, the track through wetlands and sun morough can be pretty shitty. I got lucky and didn‚Äôt really deal with too many ally on my way, but it easily takes like 20 minutes no matter what. The gauntlet in burning steppes is ass lol
---
I would agree, but I've dealt with more than my fair share of the same type of people. Then again, 1 is more than anyone's fair share.
---
Oh god, another snow-flake entitled private server tank.
---
The average mage also has frostnova and iceblock, both twice

As a paladin I eat rogues for breakfast, second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, pre-dinner snack, dinner #1, dinner #2, after-dinner meal, dessert, late night snack #1, and also as late night snack #2
---
You‚Äôre not going to be getting Debuff slots So combat is the only viable option because you‚Äôre not gonna be allowed to maintain deadly poison rupture and garrotte.
---
Yeah it's worth it. You're right, it's not profitable up to where you're at, besides vendoring, but at 300 and level 54 I'm selling 5-6 stacks of thick leather a day for 1.5g each and 3-4 stacks of rugged for 3g each.
---
Facepalm.
---
You don't need to but it's a boon for your melee dps party to have 30% bonus damage on all their windfury. You don't NEED a shadow priest, NEED a bear tank in the melee group for leader of the pack, etc but these are things you can do that are either an improvement or equivalent to just bringing another normal dps. You're not going to lose overall raid dps by bringing an enhancement shaman. The tiny difference in dps between him and a fury warrior is made up by his totem talent to the group.
---
I think most people dont fall for these anymore, they have been as old als vanilla retail
---
What gear should I roll for on a shaman while leveling? Leveling as enhance but sometimes heal for dungeons...I was healing WC yesterday and rolled need for leggings of the fang and got yelled at, but then healed SFK and rolled need for the robes (won over a mage) and also got yelled at...
---
Soul link warlocks should win depending on what sort of consumes and other restrictions are in place.
---
Would it really be vanilla if the photos weren't taken with potatos?
---
Guards are not aggroed even though they are within site and about 10 ft away. There is a spot in the back left next to a book case on the ledge and another outside to the right of the door behind the tree.
---
No worries man, I'm still a new content provider and I get this isn't for most people. It's still the right subreddit for the video though.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of someone who maybe hadn't had the time or money to jump in at first and wanted to see what it was like starting a new character now, just over a month into release.
---
But hey, we'll see how long the series lasts, it's also a nice excuse for me to play some WoW in a semi productive manner.
---
Classic wow is the way to go. I tried to get into osrs for awhile since it came to mobile but it‚Äôs just full elitist A holes that make fun of you for not playing the game as much as they do and pretty much all content is dead except for endgame stuff and anything that isn‚Äôt dead that not endgame like castle wars for example is pointless without be maxed in combat levels. It is simply a solo grind fest with an occasional interaction with a another player, feels more like a single player game then a MMO. Classic on other hand is full of good and awesome MMO interactions.
---
Would u use obsidian over blade of shahram? sorry for all the questions
---
There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to defend yourself or your position after being attacked, and that's exactly what putting people on ignore after talking shit does.
---
And btw this isn't real life, it's just a dumb game.

That's because we forgot the parentheses I think, I'm not 100% sure I can't test it right now haha!

Hello, I've played osrs for about 2 years now and just started classic at launch I think wow is so much more intricate, immersive and group/community focused. Osrs is a very grindy game, you could spend the same time 1-60 on classic just getting your woodcutting skill halfway to max on osrs just standing there and chopping trees, for weeks which was very fun for me because idk why but I love hard grinds. But wow has taken me away, in osrs there isn't alot of group activities and so running dungeons in classic,having to communicate and play roles has me hooked, I feel like it's a team sport and never have felt that way in osrs it's more like Everyman for himself type deal. While grinding classic you will meet alot of people along the way who will group with you on quests and help you. In this month of playing classic I have met more people than my 2 years of osrs. But you should probably post this on r/2007scape too if you have not already, because there are some hardcore people who could probably say better things about it and who would probably have my neck for this response. But cheers and one last thing. Osrs 1 character=11 dollars a month/ wowc 10 characters per server - 15 dollars a month and lots of servers.
---
pretty sure thats pve gear only. Or is there a way to filter pvp?
---
Possible. But it needs some fraps in there somewhere.
---
Can't go wrong with Swifty!
---
Not so much as Zygor's guide used to specifically state to grind for a whole level or 1/2 level quite regularly. So far in Joana's and Classic-WoW.live I have yet to see anything like this.
---
Play your cards right and you can keep your 2h on, tank and top the dps üëç
---
 
---
### Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun!
---
Yeah :/   The writers more than made up for it with some great character development in DS9 though!
---
I'm full Fury DPS spec currently and I've been dual wield tanking /w full defensive plate gear (~20 defense or so from gear) up to and including full BRD runs. I only switch out offhand to a shield for spicy bosses like Magmus and Emperor.
---
Other than that I find stance dancing between battle and defensive stance to pop Thunderclap on CD is a decent way to hold AoE aggro (and quick pop to zerker for Whirlwind and Berserker Rage).
---
Warriors get a lot of this even if they don't know you. Especially during certain levels, at around 38 i got spammed for SM all the time, and at 40 I got spammed for RFD. I just hit 50 last night so I'm sure the Mara/ST whispers are incoming soon enough.
---
It also died down a bit once I actually stopped playing with randoms.
---
Fair enough, I dont see them happening for a while though. You should do what i done...I was on a server that still has queues, and my friends rolled on a smaller one, now we have all done free transfer to the same server, that way we can play together.
---
Hi /u/Frigid_gerbil
---
The bot has been offline the past couple of days. Is it discontinued or will it make a reappearance?
---
Whoops I completely didn‚Äôt read the PvP part. As far as I know there aren‚Äôt many PvP lists because how situational PvP. But for warlocks it consists of necropile set with mc tier pieces
---
I just followed the Wowhead guide to the letter. :o did all the quests and that.
---
&gt; Going for rank 14 will be extremely competetive, and will require the ones who want it first to use raidconsumes while doing BGs.
---
Why would you bother? Ranking teams duck other premades amd roflstomp pugs that mostly just roll over for them. They get into nearly zero fights that require raid consumes.
---
Pyrewood EU
---
ok, watched it. liked it. go get them!
---
Level 55 elite.
---
solid guide.
---
You can't take a screenshot which is higher resolution than your screen. That's not how it works.
---
How do you guys have so much gold!
---
I gotta stop with the trade skill alts hahaha
---
That‚Äôs called a return on investment, it‚Äôs why the stock market even exists.
---
If he didn't land in water, the fall damage would have been fatal.
---
Hord-Warrior play 2H that way even Nihilium did it back in Vanilla. This is nothing new and played by Horde-Warriors only and SwordSpec-Proc can also Proc Windfury that even worked in TBC.
---
I read those comments everytime and I don‚Äòt understand where this comes from. Mage burn is so fucking op, you just burn everything down with instants, while you use a block to complete negate the dmg of wl and sp.
---
You're the ones who kept trying to kill us while we were just trying to chill in our dead civilization.
---
If the rogue is like the others I grouped with, he spent all weekend farming LBRS for a certain crossbow and probably saw several of these belts (and the gloves). I won multiple from greed rolls.
---
It's a nice gesture but there was no need for reciprocation. When you start farming for your crossbow, you'll have plenty to hand out to lowbies.
---
"No, get on our level" - the non-vertically challenged races.
---
That dwarf has the same issue as them though
---
I just wanted to point out that all good weapons happen to be BOP, in case you thought you could give yourself an edge by buying a BOE one.
---
You sound like a great tank.
---
For a moment I thought that priest was making from of the dude above him calling Arena runs needing a healer. I thought nothing dropped from arena that a healer uses?
---
Can the dwarfs see over the tables either ? Lol
---
I know roody poo was a term that replaced slurs when they got censored in messengers, idk about the bix nood, but probably is similar.
---
Hold up... So how did it get there?
---
How fucking dare you. Everyone is ultra friendly and nice all the time, this community is the best of any game. Yesterday I grouped with a random guy AND he buffed me when we were done with the quest. If that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äòbest community of all time with the ONLY nice people‚Äô then I honestly don‚Äôt know what does.
---
Haha you‚Äôre the one going against the grain of the other comments! So I guess this is where the disconnect comes from...I see your point too (I would be annoyed if I were that mage)
---
You'll want to buy everything that you use regularly, that will probably come from all 3 of the specializations. Save your money on stuff that you don't regularly use or need.
---
The dwarf made me laugh way too hard
---
That's how you summon a mount. And open a door. And cook food.
---
i dont think so
---
I‚Äôm sorry getting downvoted
---
For anyone using shadowed unit frames, is it possible to show incoming healing or is there a seperate addon needed for that?
---
Have fun looking for healers for hours.
---
Have fun running ubrs with 6 ppl needing shoulders, ring and mh wep...  
---
Im crying in joy for every caster im grouped up with in ubrs because thats one less person im competing with for 3-4 of the preraid bis loots that drops in there for meles.
---
I do, and this line of thinking it's what makes tension between groups four less than a gold...  It's completely unnecessary drama.
---
r/angryupvote
---
Thank you! :)
---
And? You act like single target is all the matters. News flash: 80% of raiding is clearing trash which rets excel at. Use your brain.
---
I have anal in both my main and bank alt. I suppose I should start thinking of new names if snowball is blacklisted.
---
This addon won't hide the long buffs in combat, but does allow you to show more buffs on the raid frames overall, allowing you to see your renew and shield with other buffs active:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mybiggerbuffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mybiggerbuffs) 
---
It's released for retail, but from personal experience it works fine on classic too.
---
Your melee don't top the meters on shazzrah?
---
&gt; because he thinks being a tank makes him entitled..
---
Thats the thing though. It does. If there are 12 groups LF tank and he shows up he can quite literally set the groups to bid against eachother to get him.
---
Pw:s doesnt prevent crits, ive had lots of time even in pvp where i get matyrdom proc while shield is still up
---
"Don't come to crossroads tomorrow."
---
Meanwhile my mate got it on his first run and I got the Briarwood Trinket on my first run at Level 57 lol. Luck wasn't on your side it seems.
---
Always get ready to ignore them as soon as you see they ignored you, this triggers these kids so much when they actually try to message you back.
---
So basically you‚Äòre the dick in this situation. Do you think he is obliged to group up?! Hell, he even (needlessly) apologized to you.
---
Some people on this sub....
---
Good joke 5/11
---
If you're on Dreadmist [Horde] my guild is still looking for 1 more tank.
---
If elsewhere I'm sure there are plenty of other guilds in the same boat and best bet may be pugging for partial guild runs as many guilds are likely to look to recruit the classes they are missing so they can do full guild raids.
---
I don't get why people want the recipe so desperately. You don't make much money making these and for skillups there are other options which cost less time/money.
---
It's called Refugee Pointe.
---
Don't argue with someone who refers mobs as "minions".

Cannot agree with this. The only time loot reservations are bad is when the party leader reserving loot doesn't inform the rest of the party.

As an arms warr, I've killed rogues 4 or 5 levels higher than myself. The overpower trait basically makes arms warr a hard counter to rogue, especially if they pop evasion. I don't know if there is a way to counter arms warr on rogues, so I'm interested to hear someone weigh in on this.
---
Well I have never played or watched OSRS. 
---
So I'll just say that Classic is great. 
---
As far as I know OSRS is a game. Classic is a great game.
---
Make your choice :P
---
While you're at it, put an anvil next to the engineers! They already have a forge, so why not.

Huh, why?

Sounds to me you want to roll a pve server
---
My favorite thing to do on my Troll Leatherworker is, when I'm waiting for a group to form, to run around low level zones and skin some of the mobs the low levels are kiilling.
---
Then taking that skin, make some armor kits and say "Hey Mon, your armor is full of holes, these should help." And give them 4.
---
Then I wave and ghost wolf away. Like a magical armor fortifying fairy.
---
That's not a jed problem
---
It's really not though, IQ only represents a person's ability to solve logical puzzles within a specific time frame, that's it. It serves absolutely no other function or indication. I've met complete dumbasses that are in MENSA and met doctors that pull a below normal IQ.

they can start by advertising truthfully.
---
Free enchants = free enchants. Not "If you don't tip enough, I will refuse you service".
---
Pre-Bis does not mean anything :D
---
&gt; People were always doing dumb shit.
---
But in my experience people weren't as quick to /ignore back then. Granted, less people were likely to even know such a feature existed back then, which might be part of the explanation.
---
yeah people that are offended over the word retard have tight butholes.
---
Why do people type again after they see that they are on ignore, whats the point
---
It's all the democrats fault! :P
---
Short, sweet, and answered the question. Thanks!
---
Interestingly enough I've started tanking more and more as my level got higher. I guess one of the explanations so far is that fewer warriors make it thus far and more priests now spec to their final-healing-spec.
---
I'd say druid-tanking during leveling is realatively easy. And seeing most warriors are neither specced nor equipped for tanking, I'd say the feral-druid might be better suitable of doing it than the arms-warrior. Especially with the talent that gives you 5 rage for each crit, which proccs off of swipe, it plays very fluidly.
---
I'm not 60 yet so my furthest experiences are from Temple.
---
According to a guide from "Skarmtank", a youtuber who played both druids and warriors excessively on private-servers as tanks, druids supposedly even have an edge before warriors get their gear. 
---
But warrior-itemization an inherent design means they scale better with further gear and eventually surpass the druid.
---
In the very end, though, both aren't played as defensive as possible. In order to be able to keep aggro against highend-gear-dps the warriors have to mix their avoidance-gear with some dps-gear so they can generate more threat and so it's actually more even once again with the druids.
---
Playstyle-wise, at least when it comes to solo-questing, I'd assume that the remark about the similarity to rogue is true.
---
I do most of my stuff in cat-form... Building and using combo-points but lacking a lot of the neat tricks rogues have. For example you can't make the mobs face a way you want via distraction so to get a starter from behind, you'll actually have to sneak around the mobs and hope not to be seen. But on the flipside, if you lack health, you can just pop out of cat-form and give yourself a heal.
---
Tanking in classic sucks. Sorry but its true. Its just not fun getting all the blame for everything and it‚Äôs stressful. Poor warris it‚Äòs not a job I want to have
---
I dont get players who dont kill the other faction on sight on a pvp server
---
If its red, its dead. No matter how many mobs they are fighting or what class they play
---
Im a rogue btw.
---
Try both, osrs if free
---
What if a warrior wants to equip a blue boe shield? Pretty fucked up for a mage to need. I‚Äôd go as far to say the mage ninja‚Äôd it.
---
you can¬¥t tame boss monsters but elites, right?
---
I remember babies sweet but damn you salty.
---
Shit lol, well how do you know it's a ramp? I totally meant ramp :P
---
What is your opinion on rolling on flask recipes in Scholo, UBRS, Strat Live etc?.. I've been kicked out of groups for suggesting that alchemists have a priority on the patterns but people need it because they are worth a lot of gold. What's the etiquette here?
---
Its really easy to get a circlejerk started and people whipped up into a frenzy over nothing. I would rather not be camped for hours on end because someone came to tell reddit about whatever mico-aggression breach of etiquette they've decided I've broken.
---
I need the know what this is from.
---
I pushed in SM Cath until 42, then quested in arathi highlands and STV until 44, then straight to ZF, currently nearly 47, mostly from ZF and a bit from questing in tanaris. I will be hitting up Ferelas a bit in between getting groups to ZF. Planning on ZF until around 49-50 and throwing in Maradon runs as well. After that quest through as much as possible from 51-55, and after that its end game dungeon time.
---
pretty sure the 96 is the number of possible straights of 5 you can roll with 5 rolls (check /u/Taliv1 1st comment in the chain starting with a deleted comment).
---
Factor by factor:
---
* 0.01\^5 : probability of getting the exact sequence posted in the OP pic
---
* 5! : counting permutation, so at this point, you have the probability of getting the \[31:35\] sequence in any order
---
* 96: counting other possible sequences: {\[1:5\], \[2:6\], ..., \[96:100\]}. So you get the probability to get any straight in any order. (you count 96 possible sequences since you see the first entry of the sequence go continiously from 1 to 96 in increments of 1, and thus, you must have 96 of them. If you wanted to include sequences like \[99, 100, 1, 2, 3\] by closing your ring, you'd have 100 of them.)

Did blizzard add a way to transfer a character to another world in wow classic yet, if so how?
---
Thick, in all the wrong places.
---
Perfect score 5/7
---
This thread got me thinking so over the weekend too k time out to flesh out the rest of the classes on the horde side.
---
Got all 8 classes now, and all the new alts to level 5 and resting in the nearest inn. Then someday if feeling like another class, all ready to play with a complete bank of rest xp.
---
Was fun setting that all up, took much longer than i first expected but, was fun to dabble in all the classes. Nice feeling knowing all that rest xp is getting banked for later on.
---
Happy to see others like this, when i see a horde i know needs help, i am that guy too (i do play on a pve server so maybe that is more common there?)
---
Where is there a nickname allowance in the guidelines for naming characters on RP servers?

Almost no where uses IQ to establish anything, they use actual standardized tests instead to assess learning and understanding. IQ tests are just a person's ability to solve logic problems within a time frame, the number is ultimately arbitrary at best. They are also not sanctioned by any psychologists because their is 0 legislation for what a "proper" IQ test entails or its analysis

It‚Äôs hilarious how much this bothers people. Don‚Äôt let it ruin your day that he didn‚Äôt print screen buddy.
---
Oh really? That'd be closer to 4-5% then.
---
If you see a warlock the general rule of thumb is run. Unless you can ravage their back when they are low I guess. But essentialy. One fear. You dead.
---
Ohhh! I met some people from this guild. They wanted to recruit me and my bf! Awesome people, really. Not surprised one of them helped you :) EU - Zandalari Tribe.
---
Are you a gnome?
---
Eh, would be pretty easy to be short if they bought all their skills and maybe are leveling a profession. Maybe they smartened up and stopped buying every rank of every skill, or the profession is starting to pay off.
---
Or BOE drop.
---
Bet you play human warrior haha ;-)
---
You definitely want it since it stacks with Sunder
---
It only takes you 3 seconds to skin a mob. At end game Rugged leather vendors for 5s. That is 60 gph.
---
Its a pvp wep.
---
We do loot council. No rolling in our raids.
---
I roll with three sets of gear on my drood, one healing, one tank and one PvP/world farm set. It's a loooooooot of bag space but it's still manageable.
---
Which is a shame because I absolutely love bear tanks. The few I've run with just go ham on both single and aoe targets. 
---
Hell, the last tank I ran with was a NS/feral hybrid (I think? Idk classic druid things) and he did phenomenal.
---
and lots of them... probably already too many... gonna need a purge real soon...
---
This is awesome
---
Yup my ud was fun af, early arena was awesome and my human I played hella rbgs.  Currently enjoying being able to stomp everyone 1v1 ü§£
---
Do you skin?
---
If so clear up your bags and heady to ungoro.
---
Plenty to kill and skin there.
---
You can heal as shadow, having a set of +int gear helps.
---
I'm guessing windwanker is fine because Blizzard are an American company, and wanker is a very British insult that probably got left out of their profanity detector

Alliance?

Im also a first time wow player and have reached lv57 with 600g, the preraid bis cannon, 2 rare pets (broken tooth, olm the wise) while using a bunch of addons and macros.

If you get along in modern games (dota2 and eso in my case), you get along in classic
---
That depends. OEB will do more personal dps, but Blade of Shahram will help your group more, particularly if they're melee.
---
There was a line hidden somewhere in the video that sums it up.
---
"All of the fixes blizzard applied were for real problems"
---
And the pairing point
---
"But it's no wonder some players felt left behind"
---
The problem is that blizzard fixed their game into a different game, not that they were off base with the challenges/problems their game faced.
---
Which is why I want to see Classic+ rather than TBC/WotLK. Those updates start down the path of "Fixing the problems without preserving the game's spirit". Cataclysm may have finally broken things for people, but the problems started before that.
---
Hunter solution: roll blacksmith and get the 30 seconds of fear immunity trinket
---
Fair enough. That's an interesting point.
---
Wait till phase 2 whit pvp system  :D
---
There a guy called wankybob in my guild. No idea how that hasn't been picked up yet.
---
Bought my mount at 40 and was left with next to nothing - that was about a week ago. 50 now and have about 140-150g just from casually questing. Gold really picks up after 40.
---
Try to edit the video and put in some cuts. Check the starting areas and how it is to start right now and give a summary of your experiences instead of 30min pure gameplay. Will be much more joyful to watch imo
---
39 is where its at.
---
Other 39 normal players stand a much better chance, but overall more twinks and every single class is a powerhouse.
---
19 is a gimmick that favors hunters and rogues, and horde priests. 29 is solid.
---
Where does it say that in the guidelines is my question.
---
There was a quest mob up that I didn‚Äôt need and saw a Horde member killing other mobs around the area. Ended up pointing him to it‚Äôs location.
---
Yer, I have nothing against getting revenge but corpse camping is just pure shitty. 3hrs worth of corpse camping makes someone the human equivalent of cancer. Not going to lie man, I'd be embarrassed even posting this.

Maybe I just read in wrong. Certainly hope so.
---
YOU HAVE to cheap a mage to force his blink, but if you gouge at the right time (like right after) it will gouge him after he blinks your cheap. But even if he doesn‚Äôt you should, the either sprint once he roots you or vanish and re open, sometimes I even blind but depending on the mage it‚Äôs a hard fight no matter what. Mage op
---
I tank in dungeons quite easily as holy/ret. i keep strenght/stam gear and int/stm gear and can do any role really. Give it a try
---
I had a friend named Cunnilingus in vanilla that name got flagged, but my alt with the word balls in his name did. Silly shit.
---
Why not, this is the highest weapon damage in the game. If you play arms or 2h fury this does the most dps, apart from bre with its proc stacked.
---
It's also the most efficient skillup from like 280 to 290
---
To be fair I do this often just so I can get the cloth to train my tailoring .. :( now I worry that I‚Äôve missed out on some sweet loot.
---
You just have to be self confident. Mark a skull and If DPS pull, that's their decision, not your inadequacy. Let them pop a cooldown or kite a mob if they want to, if they care about not being hit, they will let you get aggro.
---
It's ok if DPS pull aggro, don't take it personally and you'll feel far better about it.
---
Nice. Im still waiting for the 40g I gave to my guildie for his mount since week 1...
---
Im proud.
---
Quests. Do all the quests in the higher level zones. Just doing epl at level 60 is like 300 gold
---
Well he has a point, locking items is like a child making up its own imaginary rules
---
They do pay editors and writers a fuck ton of money to do this already.
---
I have a macro that "/y Wait!"s and "/point"s to the person who buffed/healed me, and run up to them if I'm out of combat. I then give my healthstone to them if I have one.
---
Why would I heal an UBRS PUG if i literally get nothing out of it. Besides the spell crit ring everything else is not interesting for healers. So once you've got the ring why would you heal anything besides jed runs?
---
do the mistake of leveling enchanter on your road to 60 and you should be aware of the money issues
---
Had a guy post on reddit the other day, JUST OPEN the social tab and look for tanks there...... if you are dps and reading this, tanks dont need to you whisper them. Use the correct channels  (  /2 in a city or the   /LFG channel blizzard added)  because all that will happen is you will run the risk of being the straw that breaks the tanks back, i can reply with "no thanks", like 20-30  times a day but after that i start comming up with rude reasons i dont want to tank for you.

Big Brain Time: Get everyone to report his name as sexual so he can change it to Imdry.

How else would you install an addon??

A little gnome boi has one on alliance.  Grats on the hand!

Did you play on Quel Thalas eu retail server?
---
Absolutely including! We agree on this. 
---
 DPS is just the very peak end result of all of your traits and dedication.
---
I just hate when people ignore instantly so you don't have the chance to argue back. Always want to start arguments, but never actually have one.
---
No, because one of my guild members was named Frostitute on release, was mass reported, and a few days later there was a horde mage named frostitute instead.
---
...there's a portal to Gnomer?
---
So go do 10,000 good deeds!

So if you roll feral druid you can only tank and must be ready to tank at anyone person's whim? S

Don‚Äôt feel bad. They earned it. I keep running into horde rogues that don‚Äôt know you follow cheap shot with kidney shot. They keep rupturing me. I never die because they give me the ability to control my character.

My bad. He didn't get it. It dropped for him back to back though.

low-level ones will give dishonorable. aka honor-loss. So not as much gimping.

Bonebiter from SM quest is your next upgrade

Ah ok, yeah I wasn't considering it for any straight. Thanks.

We got 2 ferals, 1 kin and 1 resto. The boomkin won all the mage loot.

MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK, BERSERKER!

WOULD YOU LIKE MAKING FUCK, BERSERKER!

Fair enough as long as they dont have peacemaker imo
---
Why is having an enchanter on your account important? I heard it is a pretty expensive profession, so I didn't look into it for now.
---
Spellret is pretty cool.
---
To my knowledge, you can only get a free character transfer if your server is particularly high population.
---
It's not a 100% thing to do, just an example. Lot of times not every pull is marked especially in easier dungeons. Or do the F thing slightly later into the pull etc.
---
The Twitch app does it all for you.
---
If you haze someone repeatedly like this, then ignore so they can't reply back, it just means you are a coward.
---
Can you just stand on the same safe spot and kill them?  Not being derogatory, just a curious question.

Hey, I‚Äôm really interested by this item, can a hunt equip maces ?

Because those are the people that take a 2-minute IQ test online, hosted by R-U-Smart.com, get a bullshit number, and think it‚Äôs proof that they‚Äôre a genius...without a hint of irony. 
---
Even if it is a real score, they sought out the test to begin with, because they wanted to have a number that assigned them worth.

Rogues should get prio on Felstriker even though their best spec is swords this phase?

Alright buddy

I played both a lot. WoW is less monotonous grinding which is bad if you want to afk play but good if that is not your thing. Jagex is a tier below Blizzard as well as a company. 
---
I like the real time combat of WOW not the tick system. Keyboard  movement.
---
RS has more in depth quests but I hated RS questing anyways.
---
Wow costs more.

Wow has actual quests and better multiplayer.

Battlegrounds when released in wow are fun.

Wow has a lot less dead content

Thunderfury you say? &lt;Synergy&gt; will see you next Saturday &gt;:)

&gt; I don‚Äòt understand where this comes from.

This comes from actually getting into pvp situations instead of just writing about it and making theories.

Yeah

also server of mine

3 hours? Really?
---
How the hell didnt you get bored after the first 3-4 revenge kills?
---
Try the addon threat plates. Its nameplates with integrated aggro meter
---
I smell a ninja looter
---
How do they benefit more from it than others? A 100g recipe is worth the exact same for everyone, alchemist or not. It's up to the group to specify the rules, and if nothing was stated beforehand then you shouldn't make any assumptions.
---
i am horde
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 56 warlock looking to grind to 60 and get ready for raiding. The problem is, I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.
---
I understand the specs I need to reroll into and the fact that I need to be casting shadowbolt, looking for prebis, etc. I was curious if there are any written  guides on a different aspect, namely which consumables to grab, and how to manage threat, and how to play a raid in general?
---
Only if you don't upgrade it.
---
But If you constantly keep "up-to-date" 2-3 slots from AH, you'll shine in damage addons.
---
how do  I install https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime_tugs ?
---
I think I got it right but I only see like to level 9 or 11 demo
---
I think some gnomes where dragging it or something. I saw a bunch running past before I saw it lmao
---
The old "cutting off your nose to *spike* your face."
---
Kudos to you for still blotting out his name.  I fully know I would NOT be a big enough man to avoid blasting this shitter's name everywhere.
---
Are you taking about the stun effect only applying after the enemy has finished their current attack animation? If that's the case it's the same with rogue's Kidney Shot. To be fair I don't remember if this was in Vanilla though - too long ago.
---
Computers obviously didn‚Äôt catch the grammar mistake
---
with excessive layerhopping (wich is sadly not really doable anymore).
---
also we have a discord where our herbalist coordinate the time at which they farmed the valuable nodes in what area.
---
that way we know roughly which area still has value and when its reasonable to assume to go and farm it again.
---
also we can assume how many layers there are at the different daytimes.
---
farming herbs at 4am-6am is very lucrative aswell.
---
Well yeah, but you can mix it up finding groups to heal dungeons, run til you get a couple blue upgrades, then just quest/grind again til you can equip gear from the next dungeon, and repeat.  That‚Äôs a nice part about not being new to the game, you don‚Äôt have to worry about missing parts of the story along the way.
---
Another option since you‚Äôre doing alts, just do both.  Park one at an inn, play the other for a week, switch toons next week, build rested xp on them.  Once you‚Äôre in the 30+ range, that extra level and a half of bonus starts to make a big difference.
---
what guild?
---
I‚Äôve done this quest with quite a few randoms.  No one ever gets the Congo reference...
---
Everything I do is out of spike
---
The chart corresponds to a full run (as in, the last boss). Full runs of BRD are fairly uncommon.
---
People tend to do Arena / Angerforge / Golem Lord, which is a boss max level of 57, so you'd be good at 54 there. 
---
Sometimes you see people doing prison XP runs, where you just clear the trash around the prison area. That'll also get you two bosses, Lord Roccor (51) and High Interrogator Gerstahn (52). And possibly the arena event. So you could focus on doing that if you want to do BRD before 54.
---
the problem is if he is only playing PVE he is probably markma so pet is just a small addition and for raiding he needs wolf anyway
---
It sounds like you need to roll a rogue to understand their weaknesses and strengths. You're a hard counter to rogues and with more understanding of their class may fare better.
---
Prot pally is great until you run into mobs with aggro reset mechanics. Once that happens you become the "just taunt them" meme tank. Some encounters just require a taunt unless the group plays around the lack of taunt very carefully. E.g. the doctor in scholo will enrage and attack random targets. You can BOP the first target but after that you better hope your group knows how to kite. But for most encounters paladins are fine.
---
Run forest run
---
Because of rule #3.
---
Did you use SHIFT, or CAPS LOCK? Because one is lazy, the other helps to bestow the blessing of RNGesus.
---
It‚Äôs basic human nature in arguments to get the last word, it gives the sense if victory. The ignore feature does that and WoW doubles down with it by telling you you are being ignored and everything you just typed was for nothing. Basically a power play.
---
I must be missing something
---
Traitor
---
Which means they can't exceed other classes easily in the context of the extended fights dungeons/raids need.
---
Lightsabers &gt; phasers. Fite me.
---
People who ask for others to help earn gold make no sense.  I am one of those who barely have time to play yet am already easily on pace to get the 90g (shouldn't be 100g for anyone - you *should* be honored with your own faction within the first 10-15 levels).  It really isn't that hard as quests begin to ramp up their pay outs.  Don't waste your money on every skill that is available because a lot of the skills aren't needed while level.  Don't go spending money on the AH to get great gear because that gear will be replaced sooner than later.  
---
Do your quests, get the upgrades from quest rewards and drops, don't blow your money on stupid things, just repairs and necessary things like pet food or ammo if you're a range, and sell whatever you can with your two skills you have (you *are* leveling those as you go, right?).
---
As /u/filterallthesubs said. He gets a group every single time. Because hes a tank. He is in demand in everything.  At least hes not advertising, "Tank LF group. 50g/run."

I was doing an elite quest in searing gorge, and some hordes were killing the mob when I got there. They died as the mob was &lt; 5% hp, so I quickly blood rage executed it for my quest. I felt real bad so I just sat down near the spawn and waited for them to come back and just spam pointed at where the mob spawns hoping they wouldn't kill me. I ended up tanking for them after they tagged it, we exchanged /thanks and went our separate ways. Definitely one of the more wholesome moments Ive had, I love this game.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Should I respec to balance now and then respec again to Resto at 60? I‚Äôm usually healing my guilds‚Äô dungeon groups so I wasn‚Äôt sure if my heals would be less effective if I respecced as balance and I obviously don‚Äôt want to let down my guild mates that trust me as a healer but yeah... I‚Äôve been suffering out here in the PvP world as a low 30s Resto.
---
I thought as much, its sad really, I feel sorry for people that hate everything
---
Do the next right thing, and the next right thing will come.
---
Glad to know! I‚Äôll shoot for 52-53 before attempting to go inside at all then. TY for the info!
---
The chance of Clerks fans being on the Blizzard Dev team is rather high.
---
Yes, for shamans and paladins who still have better PVP specs that don't even use it, so at the end it's still pretty much a meme.
---
This game has been out for little over a month. It is the first phase of at least 5 other phases, the second and third of which will be *heavily* pvp focused. Go engineering. You can level it before phase 2 comes out *easy*. Less than two weeks of casual play and you‚Äôll be near 300 with whatever goodies you want. 
---
Keep skinning for a little while so you have a gathering profession to assist you in making money. Get to 170-225 engineering without dropping skinning and then asses your server‚Äôs AH to see if you‚Äôd be better off mining your own materials to train it up the rest of the way. 
---
Devilsaur armor is relatively shortlived when looking at the grand scheme of classic. Thorium ammo lasts forever. Engineering‚Äôs usefulness spams classic‚Äôs entirety while LW has a few niche moments, this being one of them.
---
PvP is the main reason people get all this fancy gear.
---
Run around 2 shotting people who aren't as hardcore as you.
---
this person does not deserve this name,
---
THis \^ you wont be getting a server transfer in the foreseeable future. This is what blizzard wanted to avoid and is not going to open transfers unless some realms just die. Then to preserve the community bliz will merge and still not offer transfers. Reroll now or you wont be playing with your friends
---
There's an alliance druid trainer in the park of Stormwind :)
---
The thread is a spiky meat-a-ball
---
Atiesh
---
The whole conversation was a bit spikey
---
First time I ran DM on my Priest, the mage in our group pointed out that I still had my pole equipped. This was just before we were about to pull Van Cleef, so I had apparently been running the majority of the instance without my staff.
---
To my defense, my current staff probably only had +5 spirit or something, and nobody died in that run, but I still felt like an arse for not noticing it myself.
---
If they are on the ground its ok.. it‚Äôs only if the guards aggro them and they can‚Äôt reach them that makes it bannable.
---
I did. I know the manual crowd pummeler is BIS, but it only has 3 charges and then it is trash. Not worth to farm gnomergan 5000 times. This doesn't explain my questions tho
---
Me and my husband were having this argument but with regards to lottery stores posting that they had winners there.  
---
He said he would not buy a ticket from a store that won before.
---
I said it is irrelevant because the odds are exactly the same of whether or not the store has won before. The odds for the store also remain the same. However, the PARAMETERS are changed if you are calculating for the store to win TWO times in a row which IMO is a DIFFERENT calculation.
---
Applied to the above, once 1 number is rolled, the options become limited as to what the other numbers can be thus the odds go down no? Are the calculations affected by the dice all being rolled at the same time or sequentially?
---
I thought if you were attacked by a PC while in combat there‚Äôs no durability loss even if the kB is from an npc
---
As long as they are not higher in level then the hunter, yes.
---
Ok Kevin from the office lmao
---
Oh, yeah!  
---
It's the same both in Ashenvale and Tanaris :)  
---
Never understand this difference.
---
The two people I've loaned gold for their mounts haven't paid me back yet. One stopped logging in.
---
It's a gamble people. And here I am, 150g short from my epic mount.
---
Not sure what spec you'd run in a raid. I'm currently just arms. Pop sweeping strikes, thunder clap, demo shout and cleave your way to aoe victory.
---
It doesn‚Äôt not say it. It allows by omission
---
IMO Druid and other hybrid classes are good because they provide a lot of utility. Especially as a Druid you have an answer for every situation.
---
I posted this on the Wowhead site, in response to the Phase 2 release "upgrades" we get to experience before the end of the year. 
---
*"Ok, I am a little confused concerning the Mage Spell for new water.  The  notes you list say that you can get the Dire Maul quest when Phase 2 is  released to get the new level 55 water (rank 7 I believe).  However, if  you look at the actual comments on the spell, Thotbot comments actually  state that in patch 1.12.1 (supposedly the patch that Classic is based  on) the Rank 7 Water is trainable and the quest is no longer needed.*  
---
*From ThottbotBy falcon89 on 2006/11/28 (Patch 1.12.1)*		  
---
*Subject:  "no quest required"This doesn't require a quest any more.  just talk to  the mage trainer and he's got a nice surprise for you.  yay.*  
---
*Can someone please verify which way this is going?  (1.12.1 or prior patch) "*
---
Does anyone know definitively and can explain how Rank 7 of Conjure Water will be handled?  
---
Thanks for the info guys &amp; gals!
---
Under testing. I closed my eyes with it in my hand and I turned up at home. But I was already home.
---
TLDR- there aren‚Äôt any true PvP/PvE viable builds because you can‚Äôt get hemo/prep AND after rush. Without hemo/combo points from openers you‚Äôre going to struggle in PvP as you only have AR every 5 minutes. Same with blind and vanish. 
---
I would drop murder for imp SnD, being able to 1-2 SnD is really helpful in both PvE and PvP in terms of uptime and will increase DPS. That or take 2 points out of crit damage (tier 3 assassination that feeds off crit Chance) and put them in SnD.
---
You know what I hate? A really Long lag *spite*
---
&gt;being a tank makes him entitled.
---
On my server it's really hard to find tanks, so it defo does make them entitled but I think it is reasonable for the tank to reserve any item that could be an upgrade for them. What makes this case so egregious is that the guy is reserving ALL blues and epics which is insanely greedy.
---
A man always pays his debts
---
Great during the leveling phase! Not sure at 60.
---
Valor Spaulders
---
WHAT? I just thrashed it yesterday. Twice.
---
Does anyone have this issue where after every patch your addons folder gets magically deleted?
---
It's not trash it has acceptable stats
---
Does this macro work in the German Client too or do i need to edit it
---
They benefit because they learn the recipe and then benefit from it's use.  How does a warrior benefit more from a boe epic shield than a priest?   They use the shield then benefit from it's use.  Groups I've been in have all been need before greed, and greed is taking an item you can't use in order to sell in a group where someone else can use it.  You're right though, people shouldn't make assumptions and specifying beforehand heads off problems
---
Run it to get cookies stirring rod. An excellent wand.
---
You are so lucky you get to experience this again "through her" enjoy your journey together,
---
That's not how taunt works so I guess that's why your tanking sucks.
---
It gives you the threat of the person who has aggro, and that person now has to exceed 110% of the threat he had before to overaggro.
---
It is worth to farm it... that's it.  That's ferals bis weapon for all of classic.
---
Our feral dps does this. He farms it every week so he can make enough damage in raids
---
Pay for my epic mount, then I'll thank you.
---
I approve.
---
I know you think you're being facetious but come on dude, revisiting this shit three times over 7 hours? What's the game plan here? What exactly are you trying to convey here, other than you have the social skills of an oyster?
---
YOUR NOT PREPARED.
---
I couldn't have "Lust"... didn't think it was bad lol

‚ÄúLook what could‚Äôve been yours if you grouped with me‚Äù

I kinda get it, I'd kill you aswell.

I healed as a Feral till 47 something, just equipping some trash second gear with int on it.

i sometimes ask the party for 1g each to compensate for my repairbill. im always so broke :(
---
Cdew (shaman) has it on faerlina
---
Look at how many reports there are for it next to the percentage. Itll tell you if it‚Äôs accurate or not. There‚Äôs a lot of wrong info out there still.
---
Yeah, wait, what? And it connects to BB??
---
The classic Druid discord should have everything you need
---
imagine caring about min-maxing when u can pretty much pug and clear MC in an hour while playing one handed and eating a messy burrito
---
you should also look into what upgrading the skill you want to buy actually does, even when you regularly use it.
---
for example "frost nova" for mages.
---
rank1 costs 45mana and does very little damage (lasts 10 seconds)
---
rank2 costs more mana and does a little bit more damage (lasts 10 seconds)
---
however since you never use frost nova for damage and only for the root duration i never bought rank2.
---
certainly not.
---
the WHOLE idea is that these items are sellable, and worth much more in gold than in utility. 
---
BOP items are obviously always greed, except if you actually need it for an upgrade.  Any mage that rolls need on a bop melee dps sword is wrong, as is a warrior who rolls need on a bop staff
---
That explains why I keep seeing low level items on the ah for 10s of thousands. Think I saw a bolt of runecloth listed for 40k yesterday
---
man none cares
---
Someone named their undead toon Imdry.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say they were dumber. People that can beat bosses without scripting the fights are most likely smarter and better players than those that do use cheats (addons).
---
That‚Äôs what I like to hear
---
Also why didn't he just buy your listing?
---
Good thing shaman has a trainer in Undercity :)
---
Oh wait.
---
The thing is, maybe hes not raiding. People play this game on many different ways.

Alright, cool, thank you. I‚Äôll look up a balance talent tree later to respec too since I‚Äôm not really sure what it looks like off the top of my head - thanks again

For horde, yes there‚Äôs a small quest to get an item to activate a teleported in booty bay.

I used dm for deadmines until BC I think, everyone did until the lfg warp happened. Then it was van cleef

What does that even mean

Are you gonna raid with feral?
---
But if the amount of things you have to kill is a set amount then this doesnt come into play.
---
&gt;at what level could I consistently run Scarlet Monastery?  
---
31+ is good for Graveyard  
---
34+ is good for Armory and Library  
---
38+ is good for Cathedral  
---
P.S. Rule of thumb for dungeon - you should be not more than 3-4 level lower than last boss.
---
5g for the last two I've sold on incendius.  I made 9g buying cheap a Crystal and reselling arcanite with my last cd though.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dej5nj/anyone_else_been_enjoying_classic_wow/).

I had the same experience as a warrior. You still can't really hit him, and it's just that much more depressing when your Taunt resists and your Mocking Blow gets dodged, so then you're just watching for ten seconds as he beats down your rogue or healer.
---
There goes my idea for a group of friends called; Bingo, Bango, Bongo, Congo. That's alright. I don't have any friends anyway.
---
Remove the ignore, send message and then ignore again
---
Hey when you did this was your character over lvl 30? Was there a delay at all of how long your friend had to take your name? Considering trying it haha
---
Need to try this out!
---
It's raw damage is higher but the proc of BRE will literally make some targets take 25-40% more damage. Lots of very good PvPers even use BRE over rank 14 weapons because it's straight up better offensively thanks tobthe proc. The only 2handers that will grant you a higher damage output than BRE is corrupted ashbringer and might of menethil.
---
I kind of stopped caring for boosting and such in wotlk, so it makes sense! Then the cata-babies came (I love that dumb term xD) and just went with the newest definition I suppose?
---
That's not the monkey speaking, though.
---
That sucks! I believe it gives it to the person who selected need/greed before the other.
---
It's just a very good game\*
---
I watched it til the end, the bitter end.
---
What addon is this for the UI (minimap in the middle).
---
Likely didn‚Äôt deserve it, and logic would dictate your reply and defenseless of this kind of behavior means you‚Äôve likely been the one who trolled/ninja looted from someone.  Idgaf, you set expectations, if you then troll me/blatantly disregard the arrangement. Your ass is getting reported. I pay for this game and if I don‚Äôt feel like being harassed by some disrespectful meta pre-teen, I don‚Äôt have to be. 
---
To OP: he‚Äôll no, there was an outright agreement made from the start. The group lead didn‚Äôt adhere to that agreement, light his ass up. Do not want people like this in game ruining the experience for others because they think their entitled enough to do so.

A blacksmith could sell the recipe for 100g and buy a blacksmithing recipe for that money. Having items to go players with direct use for them is just a convention, some groups will follow it and some won't.
---
Why do you think gnomes specialize in making goggles?
---
&gt; I‚Äôve seen a few vids of a fury dps tanking raids, what kinda specs are they running?
---
It's a build you run for high threat but they usually use a armor pot.
---
Yeah we had a similar issue in my Uldaman run. Cleared the full dungeon with no issues but wiped on the last boss 4 times. We managed to find a level 60 guildie in the badlands who helped us overcome it. Couldn‚Äôt get the quest item off the last boss since we had turned it into a raid, but totally worth it to finally down him lol.
---
Life ain't always a brieeze. We're here for a gouda time, not a long time.
---
Its not their fault you don't know the customs. 10-20% tip for using your own mats is normal and expected.
---
It's the same as tipping culture in the US. Is it kinda bullshit that it's "unexplained but expected"? Yes. Do you still like like a dick if you don't tip properly? Also yes.
---
I do as non-holy paladin with a heal set, shouldn't be a problem.
---
I had a human mage named Rekciltawt.  No one ever noticed.
---
Destro spec with what's currently available in phase 1 isn't really viable. Also warlocks are heavily gear dependant. You'll get more bang for your buck right now pvping as affliction until you get better gear.

I‚Äôve had 4 leafs in a row from domo.., not one eye. I‚Äôve had 3 mageblades in a row. I wonder if drop rates were effected when they changed drop rates due to later phase items on the loot tables.

Sorry for a very late reply.

I got nice help from the gm and the problem was most likely a proxy or vpn that they used on work =)

i draw the line at 1g, use your brain 1g is 1g. just common sense that everything valuable is valuable
---
what now?
---
There's no "general method".
---
You have to adapt to the situation and your opponent if you want to have a chance at winning.
---
As you pointed out: Hunter and Shaman are the hardest opponents for a druid. But I'd say priest is amongst those aswell.
---
The good news is: The only one you actually have to fight is the Hunter because you can usually escape from Shamans and Priests.
---
Also I don't think that your note that you are Resto is unrelated at all. This has a huge impact on how you play out the encounters.
---
Resto is Moonfire+Insect-Swarm then run out of range while they tick and come back to reapply them. Heal/decurse/deposion yourself if needed.
---
Well, actually Resto is: Get in a group with others, stay just close enough to heal them and let them do the work.
---
Not every class is build for 1v1. Warriors are horrible in PvP without someone who heals and dispells them. But when they get those heals and dispells, they are very strong.
---
A Resto-Druid on it's own also obviously is not great at killing others. But the druid is awesome at staying alive and getting out of sticky situations, while supporting others with heals, decurses and roots.
---
Oh I 100% agree that mages should have fireblast as an option, mine has been bound to 3 since like 2005. Any mage that doesn't take fireblast is gimping themselves in order to save like 5 gold pre-40.
---
I also objectively agree with the "back of the envelope" math you've calculated here. It checks out.
---
However, consider this: the major use of these instant casts is as burst damage/execute ability, often on a frozen target (shatter), so strict damage per minute is not what is important. Within that context, you *have* to take into account the talented damage multipliers besides piercing ice to recognize why CoC starts to outstrip fireblast at a certain point.
---
Mainly:
---
-Imp CoC is a base multiplier, which means it's 35% damage that is added to the base, and then multiplied again by crit. 
---
-Ice Shards 5/5 is a full 100% crit damage multiplier for frost spells.
---
All of a sudden, you've got CoC with slightly lower average, non-crit base damage that has a 200% crit damage multiplier. I noticed it started outstripping fireblast for instant burst around lvl 40.
---
&gt; Your write, they should have you go thorough all they're games and reed everything to make sure it is all correct

I watch Kevin Jordan. He was one of the original 3 designers that worked on Vanilla. He designed the classes, abilities, and talents. The reasons I enjoy watching him are: he‚Äôs a middle-aged father of three and does not try to hide that in his temperament. He‚Äôs measured and calm which is relaxing and makes him easy to listen to which is good because the other reason he‚Äôs enjoyable to listen to is that he provides a wealth of interesting facts about the development of the game as well as deep insights into game design in general. One of the best twitch streams I‚Äôve watched by far.
---
lol :-)
---
and yes.
---
I've been doing the elite ogres outside diremaul on my 50 Spriest. It's tough, but they are worth 660 xp each, and they drop runecloth.
---
If the water near the wall is shallow, he'd still hit the ground and die.
---
Sliding down a wall does not prevent fall damage afterwards. Landing multiple times during the descent, does, however, split the damage.
---
Arms warriors are def problematic on rogue. Best way to go is to apply as much pressure during stunlocks as possible, while kiting warrior with crippling poison in the deadzone in between the bursts. If pvp trinket is gone, catching warrior with blind-sap-bandage-cheapshot can be a huge boon. After this blind sequence it is probably better to use bleed as a finisher instead of evis while continuing to kite. Its been a looong time since I dueled my last war in vanilla on rogue, but that's roughly how I remember it.
---
I don‚Äôt see an issue here and I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would. 
---
It‚Äôs a PvP server, they engaged you first not once but twice. Nothing wrong with a smack down at that point. 
---
PvP servers are just as much about open world engagement as they are about questing.
---
A rogue could keep them 100% locked, I don't think Warlocks can currently get &gt;5k hp + voidshield which is needed to survive an expose armor stunlock.
---
But if it's an Orc gl and pray to RNGezus.
---
I had no intentions of tanking it, it just ended up that way.
---
Hooch *is* crazy
---
This vendor is the worst thing in game right now easily.  I gave up entirely, I'll come back to it way later.

Do you happen to know whether it shows rogue energy ticks?
---
Right now drain tanking with succubus is the FotM with locks, you'll find lots of useful guides on Youtube
---
Hi Folks,
---
I have a 60 warrior who is pretty much done with gear besides raid drops. I want to make an alt for farming, but unsure what would be best? I often see mages, hunters and warlocks listed as good farming characters, but thought I would come here for some more accurate advice since I haven't played WoW for 13 years!
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MdfrMO9aaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MdfrMO9aaE)
---
Many people consider Druids to be better than Warriors in dungeons. When people talk about warrior being the best tanks, they are only really talking about main tanking raids. Even then that is assuming optimal gear.
---
Could just use AAP
---
Azorath auto pilot which does the same thing and is free
---
wpvp anything goes. Using pots in a duel is tryhard and lame, because it's just a fucking duel, there's nothing on the line and you just basically spent money to win it anyway

It worked for me last night, won me the warden staff and greater resist cloak enchant recipe in st

Whats the "hit"?
---
Hey, I got flamed like this from some dude in my guild after I gquit because guild members ninja looted me. They called me a lil bitch for quitting their guild full of ninja looters.
---
A pretty high pop guild too.
---
They ninja'd an item.
---
When I reported it to the guild and then quit, apparently they told everyone I just wanted the item so I can sell it for profit.
---
I GREEDED. Lol.

Some people are just literally insane. These are the types of people you see on r/choosingbeggars
---
instance lockout is 1h with a cap of 5.
---
when you get your first id/reset, you can make a note of the time. 1h later its free again
---
i havent seen an addon for it yet so you might have to do it manually ( i do it manually aswell)
---
we're all 1 decent random world boe from 100g
---
Seconding Ashbringer! Seems really balanced, very popular on the alliance side.
---
There are plenty of guides on the web right now but let's me pitch in my $0.02.
---
Use imp until you get void bro, then use void bro as a meat shield. Some people also swear by drain tanking while using the succubus (basically you're the tank, she's just dps) but I personally still think the voidwalker is superior. Put your talents mostly in Affliction and optionally some in Demonology.
---
.... I looked it up for you.
---
It is part of the "Blizzard Termination of Service Agreement" Point 10.
---
QUOTE: For World of Warcraft specifically, allowing Players who are playing character aligned with the "Alliance" faction to Chat or otherwise communicate directly with Players who are playing character aligned with the "Horde" faction, or vice versa.
---
This has defenitely taken place right here. It may depend on which GM you get - but this is defenitely a bannable offense.
---
A 10 year old document is still relevant. Probably on Classic Servers even more relevant than on retail. Because a 10 year old Agreement is far closer in Terms on time to classic than to current retail...
---
I don't have to give you an example of someone being banned for this because there is no Need to. It is against the rules 
---
OP should simply Report this and hope These guys get banned.
---
Burn the lot and the other island for good measure
---
&gt; The fact that it‚Äôs a boe?
---
Certainly.  It is very irrational to need bop items for disenchant value. A 10 year old can figure that out.   If you bring that as a  argument , you are either trolling or argueing just for the sake of arguing. 
---
The price is indeed  the other important factor.  Where do we draw the line?  I admit that this is a grey area. ideally a group should discuss this before rolling.    A 300g item?  All need sure.  A 3g item?  pass( or greed ) unless you will use it.     But a 30g item?  Be my guest, do what you want, just communicate with the other players.
---
For the occasional period of questing, and if he's on a PvP server, there's that. 
---
That's my best guess, since his original comment seems to suggest he was healing from 10-60.
---
Is there an auto attack timer addon that resets properly after casting a spell?
---
Horde on kurinaxx here. How is it over on your side of the pond? Seems like the ratio is not too bad on this server although I do feel like I see more groups of horde than alliance at BRS. Last time they did a census it was around 60/40
---
If it has decent stats, I'll AH it and undercut similar gear by a few gold. I'm not maximizing profits by doing that, but I'm making more than I would if I vendor it and I'm greatly increasing the chances of it selling, thus reducing the risk of wasting money on deposits.
---
Classes are how they are they wont be getting changes.
---
"Pre-best-in-slot" basically just means anything before the best pair, doesn't it?
---
No one said it did
---
no idea
---
About 1/2 to 48. I see most of my friends are 60 and running cool dungeons all the time, and I‚Äôm stuck questing alone haha.
---
Haha tru, he competing for the longest fear
---
he ignored the other guy before he could read any replies.
---
PvE worg wins 99/100 times. The only time worg loses if you are in a full caster group.
---
Because 1 team using raidconsumes to stomp pugs will stomp them harder and get more honor than the team not using raidconsumes....
---
Keep your gear on you. Levels as arms the whole way if you're on a PvP server. You can easily tank everything up to the back end of BRD. 
---
At 60 you can tank everything before UBRS as arms or fury you just need to get a bit of gear and make sure to have a solid healer.
---
That bastard!
---
That would mean that it's wasn't a loot reservation...

For anyone else that doesn't immediately recognize the sword.

I don‚Äôt know how the other side isn‚Äôt KOS for everyone after questing through Hillsbrad and STV. I went in there a kind and gentle Holy priest, and came out as post-dog John Wick.
---
you have to have the mats in your inventory for this to work afaik.
---
There was BonusScanner and TheoryCraft combo but I couldn't find up to date versions of those :(
---
Thank you! I've already done Feralas actually.. 
---
Yeah I prefer to level in green/yellow zones. I think it's more efficient. I think i'm gunna go Burning Steppes then Felwood. Then on to WPL.
---
All new zones to me so lots to discover.
---
Is Felwood the place you get to Moonglade from? I still have that quest turn in for Seed of Life in Mara!
---
You do know a lot of people aren't native speakers, right? Latin america has no dedicated servers, as well as most of europe, africa, asia...
---
Even so, a lot of people in english speaking countries can't even difference "you're" from "your" (for examples, see reddit).
---
Aren't you being a little pedantic? This isn't a workplace, people are just playing a stupid game. Relax and just play too. Go to a RP servers for maximum fidelity, if that is your vibe
---
Damn, now I'm being pedantic
---
I'm sure you could AoE grind SM Cath with Holy Nova at 60. The damage isn't awful, it just costs a lot of mana.
---
What is the benefit of a swing timer like this?
---
I've met a dwarf named PlasticKneecap.
---
As a Prot Warrior... This is definitely what I experience. Now kinda know how all these women feel on social media with all the thirsty messages they get ha.
---
Is BRE really better than Dark Edge of Insanity and Might of Menethil? Or is it more that you don't expect to get these items?
---
DEoI's proc is pretty sick, I heard it doesn't break from damage and can proc multiple times.
---
Open with 2h sweeping strikes and whirlwind then switch to board and sword.
---
Then that is bannable. Blizzard usually does ban waves though. Give them time. A ton if people are doing it and they have to investigate.
---
Yeah every healer wants to run Undead Strat for the robe and amulet. Once you get the briarwood there is nothing much a healer would want in UBRS. Pallies/Druids will also want the leather helm from rend.
---

Its the pvp specc for swords(or maces or axes) means w/o backstep Skills will be way better with hemo ( hemo‚Äòs pro is that u get Ur 5 cb Easy in cs for full stun rota) playable till 60 and After but Not efficient for raids since autohitting with swords+specc will do more as you at all

Sad to see reddit turn cry about this shit, but ofc they will.

Anyway 10/10, this is why warlocks reign surpreme at the water boys

Well we were stuck at chrom after vael until they fixed him, because our guild leaders were scared the ramp would count as exploit xP
---
FFA loot? Why are people so quick to be contrarian on this subreddit?
---
Tanks for sure, but you're probably gonna need to find a guild that needs a main tank or off tank.  Otherwise there's always alt runs.

And cenarion spaulders, just like in literally every raid.

I asked for a layer swap while i was out in the world a couple weeks ago, after the instance layer abuse bans. I got a /w telling me that they were banning people for layer hopping, to which i replied that it was only for dungeons. Their response was "well I just read about it." So i wanted to know where this was said. "Oh, where did they say that?" -User is ignoring you. I was very confused haha. People are weird.
---
Are you all from Texas?
---
Gah! I‚Äôm torn now! It sounds like there will be world PVP then but do I want to wait that long? 
---
Kinda thinking about rerolling on a PVP server. I‚Äôve played warrior thus far but I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre absolutely garbage in world PvP, maybe could try arms instead of fury this time but still. 
---
Rogue could be fun and I love the class fantasy but I feel like everyone‚Äôs playing rogue atm, mage could be a fun choice but same issue.
---
What a shitdick.
---
Do most people here realize that the server size in classic is much much larger than the server size in vanilla and it's easy enough to be hidden in the crowd?
---
Ndr, right?
---
Lol people act like their ignore list is the end all be all like if everyone will need them. What‚Äôs true is the reverse. You ignore too many people and you‚Äôre really only limiting yourself. The person you ignored has thousands of others to play with.
---
Sounds perfect to me, op doesnt have to waste his time and you keep looking for a free tank
---
I charge 10g per tanked dungeon for people not on my friends list because i get so many whispers, i‚Äôve had a few take me up on it
---
When I'm questing in Horde heavy areas, I make a point to help the Horde players kill a few mobs as a sort of "I come in peace" gesture. I don't want to get ganked, I just want to level up. 
---
Along that note, one day I was killing Saytrs in Ashenvale, and I was the only Alliance player among 5-6 Horde. Everyone was pretty cool, save for this one undead priest who was 4 levels below me (also priest) who kept trying to kill me. I killed him twice while the rest of the Horde players just watched. It was pretty cool that the rest of them took "my side".
---
Alc who just learned Arcanite transmute - but I saw that Arcane Crystals sell for basically the same amount as Arcanite. So is the main profit here in selling the transmute to people who already have the mats?
---
They are not fake. I had the name Gay and got reported which resulted in me needing to change my name. My name automatically got changed to some gibberish like: sdfjoiuw#4512. I just chose Gay again. A few days later I got reported again and was handed a 1 day ban. At this point I did not want to choose the same name in fear of getting a longer ban so I chose something else.

Did you do Desolace yet? It's a bit lower level but from what I remember it's got some decent quest rewards.
---
These are the people that don‚Äôt actually learn how the game works because they aren‚Äôt interested in learning, just having an outlet for their anger.

It‚Äôs those people that nothing is their fault and the people in the world around them are responsible for their unhappiness.

But what if I am playing from my old Nokia.

The thing is, that the voidwalker starts to get useless around lvl35-40 even when talented to it. I switched to drain tank build at 52 (tried both affli and sl) and I feel like an idiot for not doing it sooner. You can get by with anything tbh, but from my experience mobs start hitting real hard around 50+, and when you start questing in the plaguelands...oh boy...90% of the mobs are immune to fear and it is your only reliable way to cc, so you are just better off drain tanking them. At the end of the day it's whetever you prefer. People managed to lvl even on destro which is far from optimal but in my opinion/experience drain tanking is the easiest way.

I love wholesome stories like this.
---
Last week I asked Gen chat in SW if anyone could possibly make me some bags if I provide the materials and I got so many whispers of people telling me to check my mail in an hour and one person came up to me and straight up gave me 3 10 slot bags I was like holy shit lol so now I have an abundance of bags in my bank for when someone else needs some bags.
---
In retail I was 10g short for my flying mount and asked if anyone could help me out and I'd pay them back and someone sent me a couple hundred gold with a heartwarming message.
---
What time st does this go down? Also on thunderfury
---
Yeah, being familiar is a big part.  Although, I honestly was fresh 60 by a few hours when I entered.  Still was arms spec as a warrior, Herod helm/shoulders equipped, lord alexander's battle axe BoE equipped.  Other members were during the past week.
---
I still think the bigger part was the commitment of the tanks in the guild.  There was a lot of effort to get them in FR gear, we got the LBRS buff for everyone (tanks were at FR cap with it) and that was it, no onyxia buff.  I was only popping a mongoose and str elixir.
---
The more interesting part were doing fights like Garr, Domo, Sulf.  We only had1 or 2 warlocks?  Didn't have enough mages to sheep all the casters on domo either.  Took us a few attempts until we figured out to tank the caster/melee together instead of trying to separate them.
---
Ive watched a few of hit videos. It awsome watching him fury tank. Would love to try that but will wait till im much better geared. Just ran my first lbrs last night.
---
I kited him to Revantusk as a 51 Hunter and let the guards there finish him off.
---
Fun times :)
---
Leveling:
---
‚Ä¢ Only 2-3 classes can fill the role.
---
‚Ä¢ Lots of posts lately about how painful it is to run with idiot dps.
---
At 60:
---
‚Ä¢ They gear up quick due to the storage (fast finding groups) and lack of competition on defence gear. Once they gear up, they can switch out of the spec.
---
‚Ä¢ Less need for them at 60 because of the low demand in raid groups.
---
Anecdotally, I‚Äôve noticed that groups I build myself are generally really smooth and groups I join that are ‚ÄòLF Tank‚Äô are much rougher.
---
Regarding FN, if I understand correctly, rank 1 = the same chance on rooting, same duration, with less mana, but less dmg per cast compared to higher ranked FN?
---
If this is true, I've been nerfing my mana pool for too many levels.
---
SM/ruin is pointless on leveling. If you start with SM you'll get Ruin at lvl 60 which is by definition the end of leveling. 
---
If you go SM there's no reason to not take dark pact (which trivializes leveling) at lvl 40.
---
Imp snd is a must have for pve.
---
It's the current culture. Stay in your bubble and don't let any facts that may upset you in.
---
Just to address your concerns about gear becoming obsolete in a month: classic is about the long game. It's not like retail where a patch comes out and everything before it becomes useless and you replace all your gear in 2 weeks.

Warriors are top-tier at both tanking and DPS, so it'll depend a lot on what your guild actually needs. Which do you prefer?

In the guide section, shedo‚Äôs cat simulator should be helpful.

1. Yes I'd like to keep the default UI and only have a small castbar there under their avatar , iirc I had it back in the day  but cant remember how.

 2. Yep I see debuffs however I'm nit sire if theres a way to see buffs? I might have heard its not possible avtially

What?... man.. really? I cannot kill your character ingame? or take some herbs you want? pure intentionally? is it making your experience bad ? Then do not compete at all.  Warlock only challenged him with saying that he can do it for hours..

Should I do the whirlwind quest or just go for bonebiter in a few levels?

Live and learn. Gold isn't everything
---
Didn't they just presume they wouldn't be accepted? They just went "look at us, we're so slim now, especially compared to those chubby dwarves, better go join the horde".  
---
No wonder alliance hate them, they just straight up gave up on their faction just cos they lost weight
---
don't know if you are Horde or Alliance, I really only know Alliance side of things, but I would probably do Dustwallow then go to Badlands. When you get to 42, start heading to Tanaris
---
One correction I believe, mobs damaged will hunt you beyond mobs you just aggroed, not indefinitely.
---
Hahah yeah it's the other guy that's an asshole
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Yep, ClassicCastBars adds a bar under your target, and also to nameplates (this is all configurable).
---
You can never see enemy buffs in classic. That's just not possible, unless a mage uses Detect Magic.
---
3 hours lmao wow. I spent just over an hour last night in badlands just fighting horde 4v2 winning most the time. 
---
 Started farming earth rock elementals. When a undead 
---
 mage hits me with a cheap shot while we're all peacefully farming. This is what started it. Before you know it. Hunter mage lock and warrior fighting me and this pali. And we're locked into this battle. Eventually had to give in when a druid 9 levels above us showed up and we got spawn camped lol but we did down them all including the druid at least once. The rest of them a few times.
---
\#nochanges though, tough luck for those gnomes and the dwarf.
---
hahaha i did the same in STV, he was afk with like 3 mobs on him so i killed them and protected him till his health regen'd and then about 5-10 mins later when I was afk waiting for those basilisks to respawn on the top right, the fucker killed me.
---
Isnt snowball a coke thing?
---
Man I have been thinking the exact same thing! Like some of my guides are telling me that my pre-raid BiS are some pants from BRD with legitimately no stats apart from +15 defense. 
---
Then I see others telling me completely different gear sets. I see some people saying you MIST have defense of 440 and prioritize that over anything else and others saying we need different stats. 
---
I‚Äôve gone the route of listening to Skarm Tank. I‚Äôve been watching a ton of his videos and he seems to have better reasoning for picking certain things opposed to just using a shopping list
---
I legit downloaded it onto my work issued laptop and it runs great. I have it on the lowest settings and never have any issues.
---
This happens alot, in wotlk I bought a 20k gold Boe wand for 1k in the raid and sold. 100g can be made in 3h farm when you are maxlevel, and you will find more expensive items
---
I've always been of the opinion, even back in 2004, that everyone in the group should be rolling need on everything that's BoE. Everyone in the group should have the same chance to get gear that drops. They may want to sell to get mount money, or to buy an item that might be more useful to them. They may want to gear an alt, or a friend. Just because someone may want the item on the character they are currently playing shouldn't matter, it's bind on equip.
---
I understand I'm sort of in the minority here, so I compromise by using the need/greed system on greens only. I outright tell my groups right from the start to roll need on all BoE epics and blues and they usually all agree.
---
Obvious typo in the levels, my bad. Meant 56 &amp; 55, the rest is correct
---
Healer here. Just ask your healer if it's ok if you pull while he/she is drinking. I'm completely fine with it. I usually tell the tank in the beginning of the instance that it's ok to pull even if I'm sitting down, and that I will shout if I *really* need time to drink and buff.
---
Form a strong bond with your healer. A group with bad DPS:ers, but with a good tank and healer couple will almost always do ok. As a healer, I view the tank as my partner, my purpose in the dungeon is first and foremost to keep him or her alive.
---
As for DPS ... well, if they die they die. (not really, they should be kept alive as well, of course, but if they can't manage their threat they will have to live with higher repair bills)

Yes? You missed his point completely.

Anyone using SpartanUI? I'm trying to get debuffs to show the timers inside the debuff icons but I can't get it to work. I've tried ClassicAuraDurations but it doesn't seem to help on target debuffs (only on my own buffs)
---
I could really use a benevolent angel too. I dont think there's any way I'm going to be able to afford my mount at 40.
---
im offended that you are offended. youre now /ignored
---
everything included by the ElvUI
---
yeah I respect him. I wrote him back I respect him for doing it but he didnt have to. Pride is often a useless drive I guess...
---
STV is what creates and solidifies faction pride and or your hate for the other faction.
---
Basically every Undead is KOS for me. 90% chance you‚Äôll get fucked around with by some UD. Most of the time rogue or mage.
---
Except it has been proven that until NAXX raid's do not need min maxing at all. MC is being cleared in split raids of 20/20 to double loot already. I'm sure the 20 other slots can be whatever the f they want.
---
Everyone has this absurd mindset that we all need to min/max blah blah. That's not the point of vanilla at all. The point was you could have lots of fun with just about any makeup. It was more about getting the 40 people to work together then needing to be in the 0.1% gear and spec wise to have a chance at all.
---
Yes it's harder to get into raids as "not the internet perfect specs" but it's absolutely doable.
---
So I'm trying to learn the ZF Graveyard farm as a mage, but I'm dieing way too often. A lot of times to one or two mobs resisting my Frost Nova. It's so frustrating.
---
Any thoughts on how to deal with this? For reference, my max mana roughly is 5750.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a simple case of basic economics supply/demand. If you see people as providing a service then they can get paid - be it with gold or reserved loot - but only if the demand for their service is high enough. DPS are a dime a dozen, there won‚Äôt be issue finding one. But if you‚Äôre hurting for a Tank then you might be inclined to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for one by offering choice loot or even gold.
---
That guy is advertising those groups for a reason. More than likely people are taking that offer frequently because they need a tank. It‚Äôs even more likely if he has a reputation as a really good tank that people are fighting to play with. If no one is taking that offer then he‚Äôs just wasting his time in chat but that‚Äôs no skin off any one else‚Äôs back.
---
I trust skarm all the way. Join his discord for specific questions!
---
Actually, he just asked if it *was* a Star Trek reference. That's not the same thing as thinking that the word engage 'only' comes from Star Trek, genius.

He expressed his disbelief that someone wouldn't know who Picard was.

He did not express disbelief that someone would use "Engage" to refer to something other than Picard.
---
What the hell, so u have last on F1, is it like reference to HELP?
---
Thanks! I'll have to check deeper into this and get maybe get myself a swing timer.
---
Darkmoon is phase 3 I think.
---
I think it's fine to run a dungeon specifically for a pattern/card you need, but you gotta make sure the group is on the same page or else you can't be surprised when everybody needs on it.
---
&gt;I'd be looking to be exalted by the time I hit 40  
---
Nah, not possible. You will be half past Honored around level 40.  
---
You need to get 39k rep (6 + 12 + 21) to become exalted.  
---
With average ~150 rep per quest, that's 260 quests to complete.  
---
For comparison - there is around 460 quests on Kalimdor for Alliance. For all factions.
---
THIS IS TREASON I-

NA server problems
---
Any guide telling you that you must be 440 is trash.
---
Why is he asking a mage for a res?
---
Agreed. Orcs/trolls get killed if horde has been antsy in the area, taurens get a pass unless they start it.
---
But did you ever duel Getz?
---
80 sp much and its most likely not a 100% addition to its dmg. More likely to be in the 10 to 20% addition.
---
The type of person to post this on reddit would never even kill rag LUL
---
Not really. No one is forcing you to join a group with reserved loot. If you want that loot from that dungeon, make your own group with your own rules. If people join, good, if not, who cares. Always weird when people go out of their way to shit talk stuff like this. Like people making fun of how much people ask for items/professions in trade chat. No one is forcing you to buy from them. I know this game reminds many people of their childhood, but there is no reason to act like bratty kids while playing it.
---
Blizzard fucked Stalleg by not putting a faction lock on Horde which they easily could have done. Having some faction imbalance is fine but 80/20...fuck that and heartseeker is no where near as bad as that.

---
&gt; The disagreement then becomes you want to pre-empt anyone from ninja  rolling need over your greed roll. What other reason would you argue for  everyone rolling need vs. everyone rolling greed? 
---
I understand that, however for BoE items of high value rolling greed offers no benefit over rolling need. I am not talking about stopping ninja looters as my reason to roll need, I am saying BoE epics/rares benefit everyone equally regardless of whether they can equip that item because it can be sold, so everyone has just as much reason to roll need as the other. I do not apply this concept to trash greens because they are time intensive to sell, cost significant auction fees to sell, and are most often vendor trash. If greed means that you want an item only because you somewhat desire it, and need means that the item brings significant value to your character, then you should always need an item worth hundreds of gold.
---
If edgemaster's gauntlets drop and a warrior wants them, the warrior who equips them saves 500-1500g on buying his BiS that anyone else in the party could have used to buy gear for themselves. Therefore, everyone should roll need because everyone stands to save 50-150 hours of farming at least, and the warrior would still have to farm the same amount of hours to get the gold to buy it, unlike BoP gear where the gold gained by vendoring or disenchanting is pathetic compared to the time it takes to farm it.
---
If everyone rolled greed, that would have the same outcome as everyone rolling need, but doing rolling greed is pointless. You don't have to worry about someone needing it to equip which is not a more valid use than selling it in this case. I saw your point about trust, but there is no reason to run a trust exercise with every one of the thousands of strangers you encounter, especially when inevitably many of them will be untrustworthy. IMO the only people you need to trust are guildies, in real life I learn to trust my friends over time by spending time with them. I don't need to trust strangers, because if I always roll need they can never hurt me. So I won't trust strangers.
---
Kiting is moving and attacking in order to allow you to attack a mob without being attacked yourself or simply running to keep the mob not attacking. Most mobs run faster than the player so the classes that kite tend to have abilities that slow enemy movement(mage frostbolt) or increase their own(hunter aspect of the cheetah). You should do it if it‚Äôs relevant to your class and you‚Äôre having trouble killing it normally or need to keep it busy for an amount of time.
---

---
Lol Whaa. I've been unaware of this, seeing as when I have done it I haven't gotten ganked, and assume they understand my stuff. Maybe they think I'm a crazy guy just waving his hands everywhere. Whatever doesn't get me ganked I'll take it.
---
Almost all classes gets the best gear from raids so I'd strongly suggest you to look into finding a guild that does some MC/Ony but does not require you to attend but if you happen to be free on the day MC/Ony is running you might be able to tag along. If this is not an option try to find MC pugs to try and get a bit more gear. Most pugs do rather well, at least in my experience, up until Major Domo or Ragnaros but there's a decent chance to get your hands on some loot before that.

OP changed it an hour ago. They forgot to black out the name next to the "that's not your nickname in real life?" line.

It looks pretty similar to what I'm rolling currently, and it pretty close to the standard Sub/Assassin build.
---
Personally, I would drop ghostly strike, and try to find a way to milk two more points for the improved Sap. It's a great tool for wPvP. And honestly, Hemo is a much better point builder in the long run due to the low energy cost. Energy management is pretty key to playing a rogue effectively.
---
Here is the build that I am using: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305020005051-3-500250030332121

I've always been a Delicious Cave Mold kinda guy myself, to be honest.

Basically its when you run from a mob (to avoid damage) while killiing it. Ranged DPS classes do it a lot to gain an advantage.

I'm gonna say your wrong unless you don't do any PvP and suck at PvE that insta cast fireblast is great for those clutch moments. In PvP especially you can CoC/Fire Blast down a good chunk of HP with no cast time.

I found that regular questing got me the gold I needed. Farmind wasn't necessary. I couldn't afford a mount until 45, but as soon as I got it I was able to afford another one before I hit 47. The amount of gold you get after 40 ramps up so fast.
---
My best advice is to not worry about getting the mount as fast as you can. You'll look back in about a year and wonder why you put such an emphasis on it.
---
Hilarious that you filmed and edited your own TOS violation

Right.. Like if the majority of the people here are up voting and having fun with it, leave it lol.
---
Gold is always a struggle until after level 40 when you buy your mount.  You're supposed to be broke right now, it's part of the struggle that no longer exists in retail.  Its actually pretty tough to make money with your professions until much later in the leveling process, and still a challenge them.  The easiest money you'll get is with skinning and vendoring the leathers.  It aint much, but it's honest work.  I highly endorse skinning and herbing.  Herbs starting around goldthorn and blindweed start to sell consistently and for a couple g a stack easy.
---
Best source is the warrior discord. The guys on there (Skarm is one of them) maintain a pretty pimped out google docs that shows both ‚Äúthreat‚Äù and ‚Äúmitigation‚Äù options and instructs you to mix and match gear as necessary for fights.
---
I‚Äôve also seen a lot of flat out wrong information out there. I think articles on wowhead are the most notorious because they are usually pretty official looking and seem authoritative but often end up being completely wrong.
---
Truth. All warriors need to be uncrittable and uncrushable on bosses is 1 pt in imp shield block. 
---
Druids and Paladins have to worry more about 440, but even then a crit/crush is survivable on a lot of bosses.

Obviously not "Only" from Star Trek, people are sometimes hyperbolic when doing jokes on the internet.
---
 I really like you sarcastically calling me a genius for that though, very big of you. 
---
Let me fix the wording of the joke. Just for your sake. 
---
"Its odd to assume, or even to guess, that a word with as broad a usage and meaning as 'engage' would specifically be a reference to the show star trek. It would be similar to asking someone with the name 'bear' if theyre a reference to whinnie the pooh. The chances are low. Please clap."
---
 That better?
---
You wouldn't turn on ffa loot with randoms if you're staying to help them get quest items? Seems inefficient at best.

You are just assuming OP is telling the truth and assuming he is right and assuming they were completely wrong - no evidence at all.

Ya, this is why you don‚Äôt blacklist people. It is always abused by vindictive people (like OP, probably)
---
Dunning-Kruger 101
---
Its really up to you. At 30 its great but you can get ravager a bit closer to 40. 
---
I think the idea is, if you're lvling fast there is no point, if you're taking your time, then go for it.
---
Meanwhile every friend I have that plays horde posts screen shots at how they waited for someone to do the chicken escort quest, follow them to near the end and kill them. 
---
two types of people I guess.
---
Haha.. well tbh I was farming SM because fuck all the lvl 30 zones.. its really good xp in there if you clear fast enough so I was fine with just the XP farm. But that dang weapon is the nuts for shams for a long time. I was off so I figured Id get a good grind in that day so I ran ARM with a little CATH thrown in from 9am to 1am lmao 3 levels a shite load of gold
---
Works for pve melee, strafing is very important in pvp or on any caster
---
I think I lost my Argent Dawn trinket that lets you pick up Scourgestones in the Plaguelands... or perhaps I never picked one up to begin with.  Is that something you get at 60?

They can time travel to retail.
---
Slow fall? 
---
Who needs that when you can just time your Blink correctly and negate all possible fall damage. Even if you're off a bit, you'll reset your falling speed so at WORST you'll take 50% fall damage.
---
Exactly. I had a 1.5k TPB post with Reddit gold about a week ago that was removed two days later for "Low Effort".
---
It's a damn shame. These mods should be vetted.
---
Hey, fuck off.
---
Ah in the US servers every classic pvp server is horde majority. And it makes sense. Horde have better FPs and towns and pvp racials. I‚Äôm surprised there‚Äôs less horde but from private server stats it seems most progression pve guilds are alliance
---
I thought ability use didn't affect autoattack timer?
---
Lightwell is generally not taken for 3 main reasons.
---
1 - you can spam click it and with limited charges and people not being familiar with it, you'll have that one guy that just uses all the charges.
---
2 - the hot breaks on damage
---
3 - people have to move to get in range to click it thus lowering their dps.
---
If I remember correctly there's a few very specific fights where you could use it and drop it on a ranged group that would take aoe damage every so often so they could use it to heal up between the damage but, again, people have to know how to use it.
---
These posts are a dime a dozen in this sub. Just whining.
---
Twink warriors are a fun wildcard
---
Yup. Was in shimmering flats and was just running to a different spot for mobs. Was going to go right through an ally rogue killing a mob. I threw some dots on it and he immediately vanished thinking I was going to Gank him. I tried /sorry and /cry. Since he vanished it made me tag the mob. So I ran off. Sure enough he sapped and ganked me. Laughed at me. And then later ganked me again and laughed. Like bro, I was trying to be NICE. Such is life.

A lot of refugees went down into Stormwind to live. Lordaeron citizens are mixed into the Stormwind population.   
---
That's why after the events of Legion in the books, Anduin sets up that Foraskan and Human meet up. For the families to see eachother again.  
---
PC humans are most likely not Lordaeron humans but a significant minority of Lordaeron's people actually survived and are still alive in the Kingdom of Stormwind.
---
Those are both "LOL". Bur is common and kek is orcish.

Are you assboi by any chance?
---
*shudders*
---
okay I'm really surprised to have to point this out but gambling is bannable so maybe don't do it?
---
Absolutely. So mentally deficient they actually don't understand how inept they are.
---
It doesn't. I walked as lvl 20 into Barrens for my succubus q and got killed by every lvl ?? I came across. Same in stv, the expedition is permanently camped by lvl 45+ who attack anyone on sight and often if I find groups of horde they a attack you on sight too. Not individuals though, just groups, but I do now have a hefty list of names that I try to camp at every opportunity.
---
You should have found a different mage.
---
Not the case with Holy Paladins though, We stick our Moonkin with the Holy Paladins and they say the mana returns are awesome.
---
It's the double G that Blizzard is blocking.
---
I couldnt create Jiggles but Jigz worked
---
In my current non-perfect set I just calculated my DPS at 230 assuming I use my clearcast procs perfectly (not realistic due to travel time even if you're using chain to make up for it a bit).
---
I'm sitting at 140 spell power 9% crit. If you believe the default sixtyupgrades.com settings, my optimal (given the occasional sanity downgrade) setup is 300 spell power 6% crit.
---
Using similar math, I get 304 sustained DPS. Account for imperfect clearcasts by shaving off maybe 30dps? 270dps is what a perfectly pre-raid geared warlock can put out.
---
Yeah, on paper at least it shoud be doable you'd think. The problem being even downranked to 7 you have about a minute of DPS. Mana totem buys you 2 extra seconds of casting. Each consumable (pot, demonic rune) will net you another 8 seconds. During that time you'll manage to generate 1 more spell from mp5 assuming you have soup.
---
84 seconds is your limit. You're completely burnt out at that point. I'm not sure how long mages/warlocks can last, but probably longer and they both have emergency mana issues you're lacking. You could use burst of knowledge to push an additional 4 seconds, and second wind for another 4, but you're losing spellpower/crit for that.
---
Kevin Jordan was the original Vanilla class designer and streams pretty frequently. It‚Äôs a chill watch with lots of good information and insights. Highly highly recommend.

I say that everytime i kill a mob. Have been right about 4 times. Im your god now.

If you need protection, you need Durex-on!

---
I had an alliance mage (when I was on a horde toon) help me all the way into and out of Pyrewood village.
---
It was unexpected but nice.
---
There's at most 1 spot In a guild. No real reason to take one in a pug or be bothered about using one unless you stacked like 15 warlocks.
---
Could you take one anyway? Yeah sure. But you are never "desirable", ever. Even organised PvP you suck cos of mana.
---
I'm pretty confident when fighting mobs but freeze in PvP, especially when they get the first hit.  What should my strategy be as a hunter (lvl 32) when they get the first hit?
---
They don't do a lot of damage compared to other classes but it's not uncommon to have 1 in a raid.
---
Alliance knows no Honor
---
I was directing it at OP. The whole vibe I'm getting from this post is that they attempt lecture everyone they come into contact with. Hence the ignores.
---
I never get ignored, idk why this guy gets it so much.
---
Just like most people that heckle comedians, there is probably something terrible going on in their life.  For whatever reason, its manifesting itself here.  This is their outlet.  I would be curious if you just simply asked, "Hey, is everything ok?  For reals."  What would the response be?
---
Then again, some people are just dicks.
---
shoot on sight fuck rogues
---
This dude needs to come play horde. He doesn‚Äôt belong over there.
---
Just keep skinning beasts like a boss.  Should have no problems getting your first 90g between leathers, greys and quest rewards.
---
I have it and it doesn't reset after spell casts. If I swing and then immediately cast Lesser Healing Wave, WST tells me my swing should be ready about a second and a half before it actually is.
---
‚ÄúRetard‚Äù is where I draw the line

I just use dual wield in Sm and farm GY chest if I‚Äôm bored. But really most of my gold is going to come from mining and running dungeons without deaths.

This require you to scan the auction house yourself tho,  so if you don't do it regulary the pricing might be screwed
---
Yeah just yesterday I mindcontrolled a horde guy to give him stamina and spirit he /thanked me and jumped around in an overwhelming joy from the unlikely friendship we just formed only for 2 allience mages to show up and wipe floor with him.
---
For dungeons it's not really desirable because it has no AoE and a priest healing, whether shadow or holy, will bring all the benefits plus heals.
---
In raids usually only one is taken and there DPS is  focused on maintaining stacks of shadow weave without pulling threat.
---
PvP. Hell yeah.
---
This was on Herod? You're doing the lords work son!
---
As a first time WoW player, I did the Whirlwind quest and it was worth it. I got my axe at 33, and then got Ravager at 37. I basically used Ravager for dungeons until 45/46, and I used Whirlwind for solo questing until the same level.
---
Chasing Amy was great
---
Niceee
---
I keep seeing these, post. I feel like these people are buying gold and that's what they are putting in the comments to throw of the GMs
---
You need to realize that the patch the game is in made players way stronger than they were at any point in raiding in classic
---
Lmao I‚Äôm a pally and have a tank and healer set because dps can be a bitch and I don‚Äôt want to wait. (Couldn‚Äôt find a healer last night so I swapped roles and got an ez dps for example ) 
---
But when I was tanking SM this dps would try to occasionally just shoot, throw or move too close to groups and ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô pull.
---
I‚Äôve played this game long enough to notice everything esp when I‚Äôm tanking. So I let him grab the mobs, stopped casting consecration, watched him jump around in front of me trying to get me to take them. Told my friends ( who were the rest of the group ) to not help. He dies. I kick him and tank the mobs. We kill Herod easily as a 4 man 
---
Dps need to respect the tank or they‚Äôre back to looking for a group. A tank as party leader is the best combo.
---
There is a undead priest on Netherwind named Devinn.
---
Devinn is a good man and did a somethi f very simular.
---
Devinn and I helped each other out for a bit.
---
If you see devinn tell him he is a good person, and if you are alliance dont hurt him, please.
---
I hate this, horde and alliance are supposed to hate eachother
---
Some websites are still with the old mindset of getting your 440 def cap, which we know now isn't needed until some BWL fights.
---
I wouldn't say it's necessary for you to get your hit cap for MC, but definitely work towards it.
---
For reference, I'm MT with ~380 def (more or less depending on fights) and 6% hit.
---
Gotcha! Thank you for the help.
---
ƒ∞ didnt mean that way. My guild has a tons of nice people. ƒ∞ know all of them. ƒ∞ meant literally everyone in my guild saving for their epic mount right now. ƒ∞f i ask up to 50g,  am sure they would give me but one flask recipe is around 300g and i need 4. ƒ∞ am talking about over 1k gold. Not many people have that kind of money even like i said even if they have, it is way too much money to giveaway. ƒ∞ wouldnt accept that much money anyways.
---
Lvl 38 Priest here (new to WoW), I took the professions tailoring and enchanting like almost every guide said and now Im sitting here with 32 Gold, not even close to my mount.  
---
I figured out, it¬¥s because of enchanting. Should I drop it for herbalism or skinning to make more gold? I lvled enchanting to 205 already and feel stupid now, but I didnt take any advantage of enchanting yet.
---
It doesn't exist, blizzard lied about the loot tables
---
It's going down pretty steadily. It was nearly $1 per gold not too long ago. Even still as high as $0.50 per gold like a week ago.
---
\&gt;they need to be punished for the future sins they will commit
---
lmao fuck rogues i feel this
---
Good thing that no night elves can be warlock then :p
---
Find yourself a good healer and duo strat live
---
I main a rogue and I do not play like that at all. I never attack anyone first. But sadly it is a class that draws a lot of people that are like that.
---
people like to talk shit without consequences. Reddit/Internet Forums have a lot like that too, people will just post and then never look at the replies, or say shit like.
---
Or say shit like, "okay I'm done checking this so don't even bother responding"
---
Are you running the talent that reduces chance for spells to be resisted by 6% in the frost tree? I haven't done this, just a thought
---
Embarassing
---
Gross "our" you mean your. :p I have a floofy prime Minister
---
no they're not
---
No, not really. One might be brought to pugs, if they are desperate for DPS/don't care; so it's not like you'll *never* be able to raid but yes it will be far, far harder as a spriest than a holy/disc priest.
---
All they really bring is shadow weaving for locks, their DPS is sub-par with meh mana management.
---
If it was a mage you would‚Äôve been fucked
---
or just go outside of org/storm and just duel rogues your level
---
You're right. The issue is 100% that you're using the materials to level the profession instead of vendoring them/selling them. So it saves you a few silver/gold in the long run to only learn some recipes for Enchanting, but you're also not really making money, either.
---
On one where I have a reputation for being a useful healer
---
Really does look like something out of 2006-2007 :p
---
There's an Alliance Warlock Trainer in the Goldshire Inn in the basement.
---
They also got together and organised 40 people to kill said boss.
---
It's one thing to pug MC, it's another entirely to get a guild run. I did my first full guild run yesterday too. For the 3 weeks prior I have pugged MC.
---
Adjust interest rates accordingly!
---
If they're strafe spamming they're just a spaz.
---
Avoidances are automated and RNG. The only thing you need to be sure to do is to consistently face your target because parrying has a front-facing requirement, as does blocking if you have a shield.
---
I‚Äôm going to assume you are asking this question seriously. I‚Äôll tell you my techniques for name generation from some of my earlier characters.
---
First, think of a theme: Frost mage, Resto Druid, Assassination Daggers rogue. Try to think of general words or impressions around that theme and build a name for it.
---
For my original Resto Druid, I just randomly thought of the Biblical passage about ‚Äúbeating swords into plowshares.‚Äù Since he‚Äôs a healer, the pacifist tones of the verse seemed appropriate, so I named him Swordbreaker.
---
For my frost mage, when I think of cold, I think of the Norse. Then Norse gods were of a race called the Aesir, so add a feminine ending and you get Aesiria.
---
Assassination rogues use poisons. Poisons are toxins. Do a little aesthetic phoneme juggling and the rogue Toksin is born.
---
Or you can do what everyone else in this thread and hit up the 4chan Random Offensive Name Generator.
---
huh.. TIL. 1, 2, or 3?
---
What level are you?
---
How hard of a time have any of you playing non-meta specs been having getting groups?
---
Context: I started up a Priest that I plan to play as Shadow at 60, and I am a shit healer. I get that Shadow isn't exactly topping meters, but it's not like you really need the top specs for clearing dungeons.
---
That mongo horde idiot probably got 4v1ed on every quest he tried to complete that day. Try leveling a horde toon in hillsbrad or Arathi and see what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Your proficiency with axes is really only useful against raid bosses to prevent glancing strikes on them due to them being higher level than you. Use whatever weapon you want until you're fighting something like that. The best warrior dps weapons in the game are axes though, like arcanite reaper and whirlwind axe (at lower levels), so if you're running arms dps you'll probably be using axes anyways. If not, I believe most prot weapons will be swords which is why humans are considered to be slightly superior because they get bonus to swords.
---
Benefits of new client 8.x

I‚Äôm level 24
---
I‚Äôm rolling with the scholo legs atm but I‚Äôve thought about swapping to brd legs with dodge and str. Personally I‚Äôm not having a problem with threat as an axe wielding orc as long as I have WF. But I‚Äôm also not raiding yet.
---
I was gonna express my disappointment, until I realized he's following Jainas example, and she's the only Ally worth a damn. o7
---
It will be relatively peaceful until you hit up Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, Arathi, or STV. Then it is going to be very very rough.
---
But yeah, something is very wrong when SW, Goldshire, and basically all of Elwyn are a ghost town at peak play times. The theory circulating here is that while Blizz was offering transfers, Alliance used them to escape the faction imbalance, not to avoid queues as Blizz intended. Haven‚Äôt seen a queue in weeks, but the Alliance has certainly thinned out severely.
---
Another tip similar to this for warlocks is to use curse of recklessness rank 1 on fleeing mobs to stop them running into another pack.
---
With that, there‚Äôs a lot of melee that are farming rend that‚Äôll never really use or, or it‚Äôs not necessary.
---
Tried farming when APES has a place on lock-down?
---
I'd like to see you gather your own army to break that stronghold.
---
Anyhow, sounds pretty logical to give up a farming spot if it is held by alliance players who kill you over and over. 99% of the people you'll try to rally up dont give two shits about you wanting to kill people in PvP, and even if they did, its too much work to care.
---
I'd say that his thought process is very reasonable, I'd say that its you that have unreasonable expectations from the average player base.
---
Same. I'm a dwarf hunter but my friend is a gnome warlock and needed to go to Kalimdor to get something to let him summon a succubus so I went with him to help out, and any time I saw a Horde player fighting a mob nearby I'd take a few shots at the mob and wave at the Horde people. Although I think sometimes they take my gestures to be menacing rather than friendly. One time I waved and blew a kiss at a Horde player who was a few levels below me and they just turned around and started running.
---
Right now is the only spot. 2 lakes i EPL.
---
Before the elemental invasion.
---
There are way more people in my own faction I wish I could gank than the other side.
---
I got a slap on the wrist with a 24 hr vacation for doing this.  Yes they started it but you‚Äôre also breaking the TOS by going to them.
---
You‚Äôll need at least 4 warlocks to do Garr ideally. You‚Äôll need 4 mages for polymorph on Majordomo but you want more than that anyway for the bosses that curse the whole raid. And you‚Äôd like at least 1, ideally 2 hunters who know what they‚Äôre doing so they can use tranq shot and maybe kite Majordomo mobs. Most of the other problems with pugs are finding a main tank with good enough gear and offtanks for some MC bosses(golemag,sulfuras harbinger, majordomo) and onyxia whelps.
---
All need be epic, never greed.
---
Undercity was Lordaeron,
---
Now it's Undercity not Lordaeron, but that's nobodies business but the Undead.
---
Battleborn Armbraces, Brigam Girdle, Blackstone Ring, Rune of the Guard Captain,
---
Actually it‚Äôs not even close, you can get green healing power hats with up to 62 healing
---
THey can holy nova in aoe situations.  Just because they are shadow spec doesn't mean they cannot drop out of shadow form to spam holy nova when necessary.
---
I‚Äôm around the same level of fishing as you. Best to just run down the coast of STV in off peak times. 
---
These prices are what I sold last night on AH, Noggenfogger-EU. All full stacks at peak times and I undercut slightly so they‚Äôd sell quick. 
---
Oily blackmouth - 1g.    
---
Firefin - 1g.    
---
Greater sage - 85s - 1g.    
---
Deviate(only in the Barrens) - 1g 25s.    
---
Floating wreckage‚Äôs are priority, trunks are the most profitable, especially if they‚Äôre Mithril bound.
---
We did a pug last night and had problems, but that was mostly just pug things where people wouldn't listen and kept standing in the wrong spots.  Once we finally got enough people in the raid that were actually committed to finishing it, and we got in discord together, things went much better.  The lone druid in the raid bear tanked her in phase 3.  Then because blizzard hates us, two druid helms dropped...  For our lone druid....
---
Then you deal amazing damage in raids and get some nice epic weapons to boost your damage even more. 
---
Fury preRaid BiS has some very good pieces in it that are BiS for a long while iirc and that's not really a bad thing imo.
---
That‚Äôs not far from the truth. Lol
---
Yeah exactly. A guildmate of mine does this to earn extra. He got all his pre-bis now all he needs to do is raid. He doesn't get anything out of the runs except gold. He states his terms, if they don't agree they can refuse him. Which imo is reasonable because why should he go out of his way to boost others and get nothing in return.
---
I had fun in yeti cave, as together with a rogue we managed to repeatedly kill horde lvl ?? that was ganking people there. But yeah, I guess it's the same everywhere. I mean I don't complain, as it adds a lot of fun, but sometimes it's just frustrating.
---
The benefit more by...making more gold? So because they can make more gold they should get it for free?
---
Which are used for the Tribal LW quest, yup.
---
Clearly these guys aren't all stars, anyone can see that. That being said, does this make you feel good about yourself? Is your life so miserable that you have to get your kicks putting people down? 
---
Not everyone has been raiding forever, or got the chance to do this themselves.

It's amazing how relatively nice to each other everyone is without HKs. The real war hasn't even started yet.
---
I was gonna try and defend org from this, but I was in UC, and there‚Äôs just not great ways of getting to org easily from there.
---
I'm in a Scarlet Crusade guild and dispite this an Undead player saved me after I pulled too many mobs. I'll never forget that moment, I really think that the nicest gamers play wow.
---
Had to kill him of course.
---
Except a keyring because....we forgot?
---
I understand the "Best Spec" is combat swords. However, if a rogue is running a combat dagger or a hemo spec, then they should totally have priority. I personally plan on going a combat dagger spec once I hit 60 because it means less competition for weapon drops.
---
Also, since Felstriker drops from a dungeon compared to a 40 man raid, you have a good chance that the rogue in the group is mainly focused on PvP. This is arguably one of the best PvP daggers in the game. A PvE fury warrior who wins this might find themselves a good replacement with more raiding, and then the Felstriker will sit in their bank. That PvP rogue might never find a better dagger, and will lose a chance at a weapon they will actually use for the rest of their time as a 60. (I'm not considering the PvP weapons as a 'possible replacement' because the odds of someone actually getting rank 14 is super low).
---
Like I said before, I know that it's not "correct" for rogues to get priority over daggers. Technically warriors can use them too. But fury warriors have a lot more options out there for them compared to a rogue who is a dagger spec.
---
Do not log in outside of your home country. There have been multiple posts about this causing blizzards automated system to ban you and the stories are awful about the pain in the ass it was to get someone to actually review it
---
I think there's a case to be made for maces in group PvP.
---
I was with my gnome lock in arathi to buy the first aid books for my alts when i see a lot of low lvl hordes standing next to the fozruk giant , some were dying trying to kill him while the other group was waiting for them to fail. Since i'm an asshole and the big group wasn't helping them I decided to destroy the giant saving the small group and fucking the others.
---
It's just childish. Amounts to calling someone a name then sticking your fingers in your ears and saying 'lalala I can't hear you' when they try to respond.
---
My server (bottom 5 in population EU) at least doesn't have any of the problem some people are saying with tanks having issues to get raid spots.. Molten Core requires 4 tanks anyway (or 3+1 Fury Warr that has gathered a semi-proper tank set).
---
Also btw as a full Feral (tank) spec you can still heal 5-mans/UBRS quite fine, as long as the group isn't full of idiots who triple-chain pull packs and take unnecessary damage all the time.
---
&gt; yea it's not great to hear but often the people that shit on them are people who don't do anything themselves
---
I'm not sure if that's true. It's all about the end goal: do you want to help someone who needs help, or do you want to be acknowledged by complete strangers for the fact that you helped someone? That last thing shows you need affirmation, however random it might be. That's why I said to turn your comment around, "you were not loved as a child" seems more appropriate for someone who needs affirmation by a group of strangers on the internet.
---
Giving stuff away to person A, B and C to make person A, B and C happy is selflessness, which is seen as a good thing. Giving stuff away to person A and asking if that story could be posted on Reddit, like u/SMP750 said, is "looking for fake internet points to validate their actions and existance".
---
Hahahaha. Sex.
---
What raid frames are these?
---
Hey, if someone wants to reserve a nonexistant item, who am I to complain?
---
Lmfao
---
Why can't a mage need if the said BoE sells for 100g?
---
Are you saying the warrior is entitled to 100g that the entire party worked for? Obviously everyone is entitled a roll for 100g. The mage then takes the item, sells it, and gets a mage BoE for 100g.
---
I'm chill dont worry lol
---
Griefing is against TOS so I'm not impressed that he found a new way to grief like you are
---
I've always enjoyed calling out toxic people for what they are. What I find interesting is the people who CE to their rescue.
---
Most BIS-lists are generated by using an algorithm that just adds up stats on the items an uses different multipliers for different stats depending on the role.
---
I'd assume that Def, Stamina, Dodge and Armor have a high multiplier and so the result is that the items recommended are basically just the best in the slot for these attributes.
---
So the big picture of tanking requiring you to hit the target is probably not taken into consideration.
---
It's better if you look at "handcrafted" lists, where someone made sure to take these things into consideration instead of just blindly calculating a score based on avoidance-stats.
---
What I usually do is demo shout first, then sunder/revenge the kill target a few times, then tab sunder each other mob at least once. This usually is enough so the healer wont pull aggro on the other mobs, and if someone rips aggro on the kill target while I'm sundering the others, I save taunt for that.
---
Another thing you can try if you have faith in your healer, is start with a 2H, charge in and pop bloodrage, sweeping strikes, then zerker stance whirlwind. After that you can pop in D stance and sword and board for the rest of the fight. The damage should give you a huge headstart on aggro.
---
Yeah, me and some warrior were in our own personal hell farming tusks for seperate quests and i stayed long, long after that shitty droprate would allow me to leave
---
Quest and vendoring
---
It‚Äôs almost as bad as trying to get the gladiator chain mail and I don‚Äôt need it made yesterday just inquiring thanks for answering tho hope more people do.

Full raid highlight -  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/491432137](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/491432137)
---
For me gnome mages are kos. No longer will I try and be chill only to get ganked while I'm pulling mobs.
---
I tried. I promise.
---
Dungeons and raids are apples and oranges.
---
Exactly as likely to see this roll and any other roll by 5 people.
---
Outside of a warrior or mage what is ‚Äòconsidered‚Äô? I thought hunters where usually thought after, I saw a few rank 14s who were pretty unstoppable back in the day
---
I'm actually more shadow at this point spent money fully on black out, spirit tap, and mind flay...
---
Tanks are so in demand for strat live I can literally reserve pattern + all orbs and still get a full group.
---
Oh god yeah. I was like 8g short getting my mount (borrowed from my leveling buddy) because tailoring/enchanting (even though I started ignoring enchanting), and at level 50 with minimum playtime, I'm over 100g. To be fair, I've sold a couple mooncloth cooldowns...but it also means I can spoil my alts a little! So the chain continues forever, where cloth gets passed down, and passed down, and passed down. I just made a prot pally alt I intend to spoil by feeding stuff for engineering &amp; another crafting profession...either BSing or Alchemy, and sending him little upgrades has been really really nice. Just feeding him the cloth to level first aid has been amazing.

&gt;you're in like flint

---
Haha, thanks. Wish I still had it. I renamed it to handjabber but the GM contacted me and told me if I got reported again I would get a temporary ban and asked if I wanted another name change for free. I accepted and Bloodbrew, my blood elf monk was born.
---
Grats?  So what you are saying is, you are used to highly regulated loot and the idea that an item could be usable by someone as an upgrade is so anathema to your experience.
---
PUGs are taking undergeared players into the raid, sometimes not even max level players.  Why would you think clearing MC pre-nerf and BWL world firsts would be anything equivalent?  This is a bunch of casuals jumping in to do a raid.  No one is doing it with the expectation of winning anything.  It certainly isn't the same crew week after week.
---
GTFO with your elitism.  You've swung your epeen so hard you've hit your own face with it.  It's a PUG, people know that.  If loot is random and open to anyone who can use the items, it's up to that person to roll.
---
If it's an upgrade for me because I haven't gotten to MC yet and keep losing the rolls for UBRS sidegrades, why the fuck would I pass?  If everyone else is getting BiS and I get shit for drops, I'm going to fall behind and not be picked for future raids because my gear isn't good enough.  So kindly fuck off with your entitled bullshit.  A caster with 0 BiS pieces has more right to the head than the warrior or rogue dps with all BiS but the necklace!
---
You realizing i was mocking those who say that right?

Lol that /yell

‚ÄúCan someone give me 30s for training? I‚Äôll pay it back‚Äù

okay thank you :)
---
Surprised I haven't gotten any weird whispers yet then. I have a few names that I thought would be gone almost immediately.
---
Had my name "RichWhiteMan" reported and had to change lmaooo
---
Then "TheRealTrump" on another character got force changed
---
I mean. You'll need to raid to get epics - thats kind of part of the game. What sort of gear do you expect to have if you cant farm or raid?
---
I had the opposite of this happen and it was so odd haha. I was farming elemental fire in Arathi and went afk for a minute or two a lvl 60 ally rogue came up and killed the mobs that aggrod and did /shoo . So I conceded the spot cause I couldn‚Äôt compete with a 60 and he‚Äôd kill me easy so I mounted up and left. After riding for like 1 minute I see that he‚Äôs chasing me on his epic mount and he tried to dismount me but I resisted his attack‚Äôs and just kept riding. I just kept spamming /question.
---
That spec is now awful for pve. I don‚Äôt think you understood my point at all.
---
there is no server rep when the server size is as big as three or more servers in vanilla. It will take some time. People will eventually quit and the population will go down to a size that allows for server communities to exist. But right now there are just too many players.
---
What is the level range in bad lands? Trying to find a grind spot from 27-29 atm.
---
Instant abilities do not reset the swing timer, but ones with cast time (Aimed Shot, Slam, etc.) will.
---
Also, if you have a source of "additional attack" proc (sword spec rogue, Ironfoe, HoJ, Flurry Axe, WF), you want to use your instant abilities right after your mainhand hits because a proc will reset your swing timer.
---
Stop all DPS (including wands and autoattacks) going into P3 and give the tank a minute to build threat. Every once in a while someone will still pull threat off the tank, but we just have them run to the where the MT is standing and tank Ony until they die, then the MT will pick her up again. We get through phase 3 with 1 or 2 deaths at most.
---
I have *a lot* of luck with both finding Jed IDs, and having the reed drop when it's my ID. However, in about 40 runs, I have not seen a single Rend's main hand. Someone in my guild has it. Some random 58 rogue whispered me once asking which off hand to pair it with till he got the off hand. I've had the fucking off hand since my first damn run. I've been using this damn trash blade since level 50. I'm considering just buying a Krol Blade, but I know as soon as I do it'll drop.
---
I haven't healed since WoLK, and that when Circle of Healing was silly good. Haha. I've got a lot of work to do.
---
This week was our first week attempting her. We got her down in second attempt. First attempt was just too many dying to breath. Our tanks were able to pick her up in phase 3 pretty well. Seemed exactly as I remember the fight in Vanilla.
---
Plenty of people have posted on Reddit and the forums that they were leaving Skeram Alliance exactly to escape the faction imbalance. I am under no illusions about the future I am facing on Skeram. I named the toon "Willtransfer" so I would be too proud to ever transfer it. But this is just a side toon for me. I wouldn't keep my main on Skeram.
---
I got Ding on Firemaw-EU (full server) 3 days ago
---
Rage potions and the brutal hauberk help as well with this. Get some rage potions of the AH if you're not an alchemist, and use them for the more difficult LoS pulls. They really help.
---
that's incorrect.. can confirm as a classic wow hunter that I can buy rank 2, which costs a little more mana, slows 5% more, and deals more damage..  (but is still basically no damage)
---
Its Iron *Forge* not iron anvils. It'd be heresy to have anvils, obviously.
---
u/PoachTWC is ignoring you.
---
The crazy part is that the guide I read said it‚Äôs only used for 5 levels. Honestly though these guides make finding a market really easy.

This comment is Zechs

---
&gt; Having to trek the world to connect the flight paths is one of the best things about exploration in Classic
---
Thats the thing though, you think that this ONE TIME ruins the experience of being out into the world and exploring.
---
It does not.
---
You do a death run to get a flight path. Once. its frustrating and long. And you know what? Once you get the flight path, you dont do that death run again. And you STILL go out into the zone and walk/mount up and explore and interact.
---
You DO IT ONCE.
---
Getting rid of that one-time frustration is not ruining vanilla experience.
---
Correct but other rolls might not be nearly as cool.  It‚Äôd be cooler if he rolled 100
---
idk, but this whole thing kinda looks like that mage making fun of these devilsaur mafias, and to be taken second degree. Wouldn't surprise me if he had actually intended to interrupt skinning at the last second. The whole caps lock into "you got a pass for now" into "NSA be tracking you to nuke you" is just too over the top for me to interpret seriously.
---
But who knows...
---
Truestrike shoulders and dal‚Äôrend‚Äôs sacred charge are just as rare. In fact I‚Äôve not seen truestrike drop once and the main hand once. I‚Äôve seen briarwood reed a few times.
---
Went by there yesterday for something different and saw their pricing on large scale color printing - about $6 per sq ft - not too bad but not cheap either if I am aiming to get something maybe 2x3 ft in size.
---
Sometimes people misconstrue actions in the heat of the moment. It can be hard to tell sometimes if you were going for mob or them
---
We were doing stuff like that. Even did recklessness to try and boost.
---
She felt like she was targeting randomly on landing. One time she focused a DPS warrior while I watched him sit their hands at their sides while the tanks hit away, and she just stayed on him. Went in to phase with full rage and everything.
---
&gt;Sunder is underrated.   
---
Underrated?  I thought using sunder was pretty much warrior 101 and like the first thing a warrior should know.
---
There's just one thing I disagree with this, otherwise he's spot on:
---
Forget imp heroic strike. You'll barely have enough rage to use bloodthirst and whirlwind on cooldown. And even if you do, sunder armor in the beginning is a more rage efficient method of increasing your damage than heroic strike.
---
Heroic strike is only useful at 60 with good raid gear. You'll know when you start to get close to capping rage even while using bloodthirst and whirlwind on cooldown.
---
So just move those points into Deflection. Doesn't seem like much, but 2% extra parry will help decrease your downtime, and heroic strike is truly that awful.
---
If DBZ taught me anything the longer you "AHHH" the more powerful you are.
---
yuvp, multiboxer bought 2000g worth of dsaur leather lul
---
No, he just simply replied to the wrong person, u/Snakerunners was asking about the use of these swing timers.
---
AAAAAeeeeee that‚Äôs hilarious
---
So now it's 7-8 hours and not 5? Lol...... Next comment gonna be 10-12 hours? I clearly said that it's 5 and that there's another 5 extra do anything else which is enough for most people without kids. Once again you're just listing random minor shit that most people don't care to do. If they want to spend 5 hours on WOW and 5 hours on other things that's perfectly fine. They don't need to volunteer or write a novel, that's not neglecting life. That's just you listing random things they could be doing (things that YOU deem worthy), those things aren't *essentials* to life.
---
The fact that you think your opinion matters to how I or anyone else handle our lives is hilarious. Your opinion being annoying doesn't mean anyone feels guilty about spending 5 hours playing a video game, believe me.
---
Sorry you feel that way. Overwatch takes the cake for me
---
205 enchanting I would stick with it.  Maybe leave it alone until you are mounted.
---
Some of the disenchants you get now/soon sell for 2g+ on the AH.  I had a rogue in a recent group that offered to need all the stuff we didn't actually need and DE it for us.  I made like 8g that single run just because he was DE and giving it to me.  I split it half with him.  So maybe offer that up to your groups.
---
I assure you lottery winning odds are worse than that lol, unless the only lottery you play is pick 4
---
That doesn't actually do anything if someone is already way ahead of the tank just from their P1 threat. Having people die generally works but that's hardly ideal - and you don't know that you need to run to that spot until she's already targeting you, by which point it might be too late and she's already casting breath.
---
You don‚Äôt need to spec as disc or holy to heal dungeons at your level. I healed Sm cleave groups pretty easily as shadow, so you should be fine once you get the gist of how they are done.
---
hillsbrad and arathi are pretty much horde territory on stonespine EU.

OK lol

So then do you both still get quest credit for killing him?

I read this comment chain mid yawn and the laughter abruptly ended the yawn but the yawn ruined the laugh.
---
My brain is laughing but my lungs hurt.
---
Threat meters aren't accurate and you dont understand her mechanics.
---
During p2 her fireballs target those with the highest threat and wipe their threat when hit. Your tanks should be following her and sundering as much as possible while she's flying.
---
People who do inevitably have threat when she lands should suicide in the tank spot in order to not kill anyone else.
---
Kill him
---
He referred to reserving orbs as "it" so when he used "it" again to refer to running strat live I mistook it for:
---
"otherwise why would you [reserve orbs]"
---
Problems were on landing.
---
Made sure tanks were full rage, even tried recklessness.
---
Ranged were getting hit with fireballs.
---
She felt like she was targeting randomly. Wasn't even only at ranged, we had a warrior hold threat who was literally doing nothing (I watched).
---
Dual Wield arms with sword spec is actually not bad. Not as good as a 2-hander, of course, but if you're determined to dual wield, it's not a bad way to go about it. The Thrash Blade and HoJ only helps it even more.
---

---
My guild had no issues with her.  There is a moment where the tank loses aggro and has to quickly regain it.
---
Some subreddits have it enabled and others don‚Äôt. The app makes it nearly impossible to tell one from the other.
---
So how much do you want to give me your reddit username? ^^^^^/s
---
You'll make most your mount money right around level40. At level 30ish I probably only had 25g. Quests start rewarding more and items start selling for more. 
---
My suggestion is to not slow your leveling to grind gold. Grinding gold is more efficient at higher levels. I was 41 when I snagged my mount. Focus on experience, selling what you find along the way, and pushing through the levels questing.
---
Slow down there Rocket, let dizzy have his eye!
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúplay the game‚Äù? Isn‚Äôt having fun the goal of the game?
---
There's RFD, which has a few nice drops, and is fairly easy and decent experience. Also, after you hit 50-51, go to Maraudon and farm for your +hit ring off Princess. That will give you a couple levels by itself.
---
Yes but they are a lot more common compared to a world drop green that has a random roll for stats... 
---
Theoretical BiS vs Practical BiS
---
Phase 3 threat table transfers from phase 1 threat table. 
---
But the fireballs (that she spits periodically in phase 2) directly hits a person settting his threat to 0 in the table.
---
And in phase 2 she targets ppl with highest threat from phase 1 (so tanks). 
---
So when she lands in phase 3, you tanks start from 0 threat, when most dpses hang at like 10k or whatever you get in phase 1.  So you all wait when tank builds 10k+ threat again to overtake dpses.
---
~
---
how to counter it? just autottack/wand at phase 1, so you get low threat. (tanks threat is irrelevant since its got reseted to 0). So dpses/healer need to have low threat in absolute numbers, so it would be easier to tank to build this threat at phase 3.
---
or more advance strat, have second tank hang on like 10-15th place in the threat table on phase 1, so when she lands he would be without reseted aggro and pick here up much more easily.
---
tldr. tank start from 0 threat at phase 3, cos fireballs reset aggro to 0. while other ppl still got threat in phase 1.
---
phase 2 threat is irrelevant.
---
I got Bag'thera in STV this exact way. I even got it on capture I think. Fun stuff
---
I think that‚Äôs reasonable. My comment was in response to what I see as a massive over reaction and bringing in topics, i.e. ‚Äúsjw‚Äù, that have nothing to do with this situation. Projecting like that can be a sign of other issues. One of which can be lack of positive attention, or love. 
---
Lol it‚Äôs all a bit hyperbolic though of course. Not surprised, but a bit dismayed people are upvoting his comment. People try to get affirmation in strange ways all the time, seems a bit harmless here. Then he jumps straight to commenting on a generation of people and making sweeping statements. It‚Äôs a bit absurd and way beyond the scope of the OP interaction.

Ofc.

Most common lottery is pick 6 out of 49, chances of winning are 1 in 1 in 13,983,816. This particular event I just posted has a 1 in 100,000,000 chance of happening (0.01*0.01*0.01*0.01) which is 7 times less likely
---
Lol you made the no guilder and the other guild dude stand out of the photo... Kinda lame.
---
Eranikus holy shit. My group has been doing ST lately as the grind XP is actually pretty good, and we clear all bosses with ease but we haven't been able to do him yet. That non-dispelable sleep is a huge PITA.
---
Yeah, it does. Having frustrations and overcoming them is an extremely important aspect of video games (and life in general, really) that makes the experience memorable and rewarding. 
---
When everything is easy, readily obtainable and handed to you on a silver platter, there is no feeling of accomplishment. Everything becomes tedious and boring.
---
This kind of design is what ruined Retail. Not a single instance of it, but every little frustration ironed out makes for a hollow game experience.
---
All the PvE servers I see are medium at least.  But this was on a highpop server.  :)
---
Good luck giving handouts with no character name
---
I need to know, too.!!
---
OP I made this mistake, did all the Mithril order quests etc without actually getting the Armorsmith quest. Have you spoken to Myolor Sunderfury in IF (next to BS trainers). He asks which you want to be, select Armoursmith and the quest will pop up above Grumnus Steelshaper who will want you to craft some items which you will already have the plans for since you‚Äôve done the steps.
---
I think you think that‚Äôs funnier than it actually is.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt need to shield tank until BRD
---
lol.  Maybe Classic isnt for you.
---
I'm absolutely understanding of such things. All I ask for is the courtesy of a reason. Just say "I'm almost done," or "no thanks, I prefer to do this on my own."
---
It's particularly rough when it comes to collection quests because the drop rates in Classic are pretty abysmal (because there are so many claw-less gnolls, eyeless murlocs, toothless troggs, and brainless basilisks on Azeroth, amirite?), so if you don't want to group for those kinds of quests, I totally get that. But don't baselessly decline every group offering because of it. This version of WoW was meant to be played with others.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs how it works. That dps warrior was the highest person on threat who didn‚Äôt eat a fireball in P2.
---
Secondarily, every warrior becomes a potential tank in P3. If it ends up on a warrior when she lands you got lucky.
---
I tried doing it as a druid with my warrior friend. My friend was probably too low level, I think the named mob was orange. Guy hit for 400-500 damage so we just gave up and took turns tanking and jumping off the ledge so we could get the plans. No head though, guy is TOUGH.
---
But you are clearly the one being wrong. Its ridiculous to argue otherwise.
---
Right no spec is optimal for both. You typed that SF was dreadful for pvp . Which is wrong
---
I haven't done her yet but all the descriptions I'm hearing line up with what I remember it being like in Vanilla.  It we all know how good human memory is.
---
I read the same guide and just crafted a yellow instead an ir maybe cost 20 extra runecloth. The bags are not worth the hassle for sure.
---
Yup. I usually leave general on but I've got a separate tab that filters it out for when the chatter is getting to be too much. Not everyone is tuned in to general all the time
---
I'll sell it for 7.9 oz of belly button lint
---
that's fine you will still be plenty good even as Shadow
---
for spellcleave groups not many people will be taking much damage at all outside of the tank pulling mobs
---
Although you calculated the odds of a roll where 4 people roll the same number correctly, the statement " **Seven times more likely to win the lottery than to see this RNG again"** is a bit ambiguous. 
---
If by win, you mean get any prize i.e. the lowest paying prize (1 in 38.32) that is way more than 7x as likely. 
---
However if you mean win the jackpot ( 1 in 292,201,338) the jackpot is exponentially more difficult to win.

Man, and here I am sleeping a warrior running around 10% hp to get him to full health fast, and he kills me after the sheep runs out.
---
Damaging the mob resets how long it'll chase you. You can kite anything across the map so long as you tag it every 5 seconds or so (how you have to kill the Winterspring demon for Rhok'delar).
---
Side note, some mobs will trigger city guards to attack them. So long as you do a decent chunk of damage, you can have the guards help you kill difficult enemies and get credit (elite crocs near grom'gol come to mind).
---
&gt; Oh god, another snow-flake entitle

Oh no another shitter that ass pulls every pack they walk by.
---
slower weapons benefit more from windfury.
---
1000% yes. But aim for closer to the 30-40 level deficit for maximum efficiency and effectiveness
---
Yeah a lot of people take it for granite, that because no one has ever corrected them, they are saying it right. They never actually type it out, so no one notices.
---
Do I make my alt on the same server/faction or make an alliance alt? Curious to hear what you guys have decided to do. 
---
I have an Orc rogue at level 55 and want to max out a mage next. I figured I should go alliance to have a character on each faction, but then I don't get the benefit of having characters on the same realm. I know there's no right answer here, just want to see what other people have done and get a few opinions.
---
Frostnova all you want, im under FAP
---
I installed mobinfo2 ; not showing drops and dropchances for me. I need help :-(
---
Sword spec isn't necessarily better than axe spec. 
---
Well geared max level pvp players who already have a lot of crit prefer it because when it does proc you can completely 1 shot people but axe spec is better off when you have a low crit chance to start with.
---
Same thing happened to me. Poor little gnome. :/
---
 Because we have a migraine ü§ì
---
If it is an item to start or end a quest,  everyone will get one,  and you need to remember to loot yours.
---
As a forsaken priest, this is why I go out of my way to try and kill every paladin of the light that I see. The light itself didn't forsake us, it was the dirty alliance and their pretentious holy knights.

I feel he is the more bearable streamer, compared to others included in the classicast

I got 100g from level 38-41 by farming elementals. Took very little effort. 2 weeks is a loooong time to farm 100g for someone with a mount in their 40s.

So will overpower reset swing time?
---
Think of the exposure you'd get. /s

Just rng being rng. I have barely seen any usable mage loot including mageblade and such in 5 ish weeks now

Is there a way to get a few days playtime without buying a months subscription.
---
The time has come where it's ran out and I'm too skint and rather than trawl the web to find out I'm just an idiot, I'd rather just ask and be told here... Thanks :)
---
I look up lists of mythological figures from cultures I think are cool, I try real names sometimes, I google "words having to do with X", etc. Shortness is key; I used to have a bunch of characters with long-ass names like Induction and that sucked and I hated them.
---
Most of my characters have names that are water or ice related. Fluid, Flow, Mist, Lake, Rain. Some are just names I've always used that are short and easily pronounceable but not actually words so they're never taken; when I was choosing a classic server, I couldn't find ANY server where my "main" name was taken despite being four letters, no weird characters, close to an english word, a reference to something from vanilla wow, etc.
---
I like some real girls names too. Grace, Lily, Daisy. I made a priest during Legion on a high-population server and the name Hope was available. How???
---
I also keep a list of names that I like and I try those first, then look for things like them. You can throw in a weird "i" if your preferred name is already taken but I never do that, because then you feel like an offbrand version of what you wanted to be.
---
That's what he means. Secret loot reservation. Where you don't know about it till the item drops. In which case it ends up being ninjaing basically.
---
Nice!!!!!
---
I greatly appreciate the offer, but I‚Äôm on Grobbulus!
---
If I can still make a request, pay it forward to another struggling lowbie. Never know what kind of good connections you‚Äôll make!
---
Also, you totally missed the point, AGAIN. It's not that engage is only associated with picard. It's that the guy didn't know tho picard was. That's the point of the post. How do you still not get this? 
---
Similarly, it wouldn't matter whether 'oh bother' is only associated with pooh. It would be remarkable if someone replied, "who is winnie the pooh?"
---
Seriously obtuse.
---
It does depend how often you play in those 2 weeks though I guess.
---
did you read the "while leveling" part at all?
---
I laugh at lock, I wait till you cast fear then silence you then it's just a DPS race and my Shatter spec wins every time.

Nova, Frostbolt CoC. 2k damage done. Maybe a Fireblast and spam Arcane Explosion. Then just Ice Block as the Warlock sits in his body hoping his dots will kill you and laugh as you eat and drink because you picked a class with actual damage and utility.
---
I urge you all to take advantage of the /who mechanic. 
---
I typed in /who warlock badlands and copy pasted a whisper to about 10 warlocks saying, hey could you please summon me! Three of them said yes and I was in the zone within minutes...
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate how much people are willing to help!
---
I find it implausible that there is any possible scenario in which you get more total honour by farming gold for consumes for N hours and ranking for M hours, instead of just ranking for N+M hours.
---
Maybe you delete that clothie in greens 1/10th of a second faster because you flasked, but how long did it take you to get that flask or the equivalent value? An hour? That can't possibly work out to be a net benefit.
---
Kick the warrior then
---
I use a couple but could be an issue I'll look into possibly re downloading them from 100% legit sources. What's the best go to sites for reliable addons?
---
I named my Troll Mage Sarumon - and people seem to get it... occasionally. ^^
---
It's not a PVE warrior weapon - it's either given to a shaman/paladin if for some reason you have one in your raid, or to whoever "deserves" it the most for PVP.
---
I found those elementals to be incredibly profitable. They drop great vendor trash and Elemental Earth sells really well.
---
Definitely not my own IP
---
I tanked Uldaman at lvl 51. Warrior. Yes, Archaedas was awful. But a combination of having a taunt, using a sword (for extra weapon skill) and having the dps wait a bit for me to get threat allowed us to get him down. Also, a big advantage for warriors is sunder armor. For a red mob, your damage dealt is cut significantly, but sunder armor will do threat regardless of your damage dealt. You just have to overcome rage starvation.
---
Nah, where's the classic spirit in that?
---
Yeah I have it, thanks for your reply though!
---
I started adding to the report that it wasn't spam but a report for each instance so they know how many times it happens. It takes a lot of reports before they do anything so might as well send one for each case.
---
I feel your pain. Tried to run ST as a holy preist the other day. The dungeon is REALLY cloth heavy and the only people who ever want to run it are priests. Took me three days to find a group.
---
I had to respec to shadow and come as a DPS and Pass on all boss loot just to get a slot to come. 
---
Then we almost didn't finish because the Tauren Icebreaker dropped and the DPS warrior ninja'd it before hearthing out.
---
Ok you got me there
---
A-A-Ron
---
It sure is a good thing you showed up to tell all of us what's funny or not. Wheew! That was a close one. You're a hero.
---
Somewhat reassuring but I can't seem to find anyone else who have had the same issue.
---
When I got WoD I picked a lock as my free level 100. Granted, I've leveled a lock to 30s or 40s a few times, I know the basics, etc.
---
I'm pretty sure that after Cataclysm they just kept changing locks over and over because they didn't know wtf to do with them.
---
I had no idea how to effectively play my level 100 warlock, nothing I did felt right. Just lots of button pressing and nothing felt like it flowed together.
---
Vanilla was a good time for locks, though.
---
Respectfully worrying about your security to this degree is probably doing you more harm then good.
---
First you can't make a alliance char on a PvP serv where youhave an horde char.
---
Then the only benefit I see having another char but on the other side is for the story/questing experience, because it's basically another game for the first 40 lvl.
---
Just don't use thunder clap. it's a terrible skill to use as a tank.
---
Farm humanoids 3-4 lvls lower than you for cloth and vendor loot

Then it's not a screenshot, it's some kind of graphics exporting system that bypasses the screen entirely.

yeah cuz there's nothing for tanks, but when you whisper a priest needing 1 more person and you are reserving everything. Happened saturday. Warrior messages me for strat live, pattern and orbs reserved, which is 100% until the people you whisper actually need those items specifically truefaith vestment patterns. If I'm ever not in a dungeon I get  so many whispers, this I've been in MC and had whispers to come to MC or Ony.
---
Loot be like that.

Got Truestrike on my very first run in UBRS yesterday as a fury war, won the roll over 6 people.
---
Meanwhile I've done over 20 BRD arenas so far and have yet to even see Gorosh (Guy who drops Savage Gladiator Chain) spawn as my arena boss.
---
Shadow is a nich role you want 1 for raids to buff warlocks damage they just don‚Äôt bring as much utility compared to mages (food water isn‚Äôt buff)
---
And mages damage is more versatile. 
---
Shadow can top meters but you need the gear to back it up once your geared you can too dps but have to be very good.
---
Idiots want the healer, but don't want to gear the healer.
---
Alliance vs Horde works a bit like civil wars in general. Both sides accuse the other side of crimes but in the end both sides have done lots and lots of nasty things.
---
Me too, but with daggers and stabbing. It's very much up to chance whether I'll be stabbing you or the mob you're fighting. 
---
Always stab the mages because no love for OP hero class.
---
Always stab people from 2 particular guilds. 
---
Always stab my rogue nemesis. 
---
Sometimes stab level 55+ depending on mood. Usually not stab 54- people, unless they attack first, at which point stabbing commences.
---
On a warrior you can soften them up with a garrote then a quick rupture the vanish, unless they're quick on demo you can wait while those 2 bleeds wittle them down then proceed to open again with cheap shot
---
makes sense, but many people also have a relatively stable schedule so guild raids are ideal for them. even if there is some turnover, most will stay the same, so even if you have bad luck, you will gradually have less competition for gear. whatever works for you though. it is a game after all and play to have fun.
---
&gt;Come on, now. Your joke is built on a faulty premise.
---
" then I met someone as unbelievably anal as you. I hope you learn to relax a little in the future. "
---
That pressure when someone gives you mats for an enchant, you open up trade window, and then you slightly panic when you have a hard time finding the right one...
---
Shadow priority is always +spirit. That way you are getting the most from spirit tap and minimizing your downtime between mobs.  So you have a smaller mana pool but better regen.
---
When healing you are not going to get the final blow, so spirit becomes useless and depending on the group you may oom quickly (you prob don't have the gear to downrank either).  So you opt for a bigger mana pool by stacking +int instead.  You are going to be drinking lots anyways but just makes it less overall. And more tolerance to bad groups / chance crazy encounters.
---
Bite claw dash growl. Whoever said to keep claw on auto is retarded, I see literally zero scenario where that is preferable to keeping claw on manual except for dungeons and straight PvP, but in both of those cases I still have bite.
---
Bite/growl auto, dash and claw manual. In dungeons bite/claw auto. Claw will focus dump your pet, so you don't want it on auto. It doesn't matter if you just do claw/growl, you'll still be clipping growl CD's, especially with BT who will basically claw on GCD. Bite has more damage per focus so it is better than claw unless you would focus cap; which is why you train claw as well, so that you can cast it manually any time you are close to cap (which will be pretty rare) and when you aren't using growl at all.
---
Sonii

But but but ma pitchforks is redy
---
You can play pvp with success as every single class and specc. However if you wanna play in premades it's a different thing
---
meh. let them have their potato TV lives
---
Witch-hunts are inappropriate.  It‚Äôs mob rule against crimes that never occurred.
---
WoW Classic however is a community centric game for better and worse.  Mods should use discretion when deciding what to allow or not, as that‚Äôs their job.  However, that is also more difficult and receives calls of favoritism or such.  And they are already believed favor Horde as an example.
---
Their method is safer call, but also the more cowardly one.
---
No but you sure do.

Dual monitors is nothing new.

 **&lt;GankEm and SpankEm&gt;** **\[US-EAST\] \[BENEDICTION-PVP\] - We are NOOB FRIENDLY!**
---
We are a pretty small guild right now, that is trying to recruit some more players! Most of us have real life responsibilities during the day, so you'll find a lot of us on in the evenings and weekends. We have a very small core group of guys that we are trying to expand upon.  We've had some success pulling some awesome people to play with from Reddit, so I'm hoping to continue that trend!
---
Our main goal right now is to help each other level up, run dungeons, work on professions, etc. We want to get into raiding and more organized PvP eventually, but none of us are in a major rush. If you are looking for some laid back people to play with and enjoy helping other players, then come give us a shot. If you are completely new to WoW, come join us! We have members that are always willing to help!
---
Feel free to send me a message here or on Battlenet at SLUzer#1138.  If I'm not online, I may have an officer send you an invite.
---
I randomised the name Pornhaden the other day
---
Since when do people don't get the words NEED and GREED ? That gotta be some stupid retail shit were people don't have to think about the other people they are in group with because you never see them again.
---
That‚Äôs what we used to call smack and blow together in a 1 to 2 proportioned line. Not in a rig. May have been a southeast thing. Don‚Äôt hear it so much anymore. That and I don‚Äôt do snowballs anymore anyway, so that could also be a factor.
---
Yeah what am I missing here lmao
---
All these systems Blizzard add exist in a vacuum that disappears with the next expansion. MoP farms, WoD Garrisons, Legion legendary weapons, etc. The only thing I can think of that they properly introduced were gems in TBC.
---
There is few upgrades for dps warriors each tier. 4-5 items in MC, couple cloaks, weapons, trinket rings off parts like boots etc in BWL. Few more parts when AQ40 comes out etc. If you wanna replace that leather eventually ur gonna have to either dish out tons of gold for Lionheart, Cloudkeeper Legs, and then ofc. Push for BARE MINIMUM rank 10 pvp, but rank 13 has some insane items aswell like Legs
---
As a healer, I never had a single mage fussy about giving me water. And if he did, well let's just say it's pretty likely he would pay the price in repair fees.
---
Your best bet would be to find some druids that like healing. If a druid is the only rez in a dungeon you can get into some annoying corpse runs. However with a DPS who can rez they're back to being just as good as any other healing class for 5 mans.
---
Ok I‚Äôm a 27 almost 28 warlock. Nearly done with the barrens, did stonetalon mountains. Where do I go next to quest? I have breadcrumb quests to hillsbrad and another place (ashenvale I think) that have greyed out, and an orange quest to go to 1000 needles. So...where to?
---
I /w'ed someone the other day i'd never seen/spoken to before and i was already ignored. Guess i did something? :D
---
Retail had an addon called Move Anything (or Everything?). You should be able to find a classic equivalent.
---
I'm a nelf priest currently level 45. I'm shadow now but thinking of switching to holy at 50. I'm really interested in maxing out spiritual guidance and spirit tap for a huge boost to my spell dmg to make soloing a bit easier. 
---
At my current spirit level, this would give me about 85 extra spell dmg while spirit tap is active. I think this is pretty solid but I'm wondering how this would synergize with starshards, the oft neglected nelf priest spell. Would the 85 spell dmg be added to each tick, or would it only be added to the overall dmg?
---
That's pretty much correct. Druids are great dungeon tanks, but they are really shit at dpsing. Warrior does both things very well, but tanking dungeons is more difficult as warrior.
---
Should put a bulk buy in there. a full dungeon worth of heals (max 1 wipe) for like 5g.
---
Check out SUF (shadowed unit frames) can easily be customized for what you are looking for.
---
Show me your gear set and talent spec that has you both uncrittable and useful for more than 10 seconds.
---
or step stools
---
Who said anything about doing PvP?
---
In general content, if the shaman drops wf and has mana, the warrior will kill everything. Lightning bolt is only going to oom you faster, not worth it.
---
You know? You're absolutely right! Im just so angry. What was I thinking putting this sorta funny thing on here?? Thank you sir for your intelligent and apt assessment of this post. I shall take it down straight away and only post future items when I run them past you. Lol.
---
This is either some grade S+ trolling or laughable chest beating.  There is just enough self-back patting cringe to make me think it is real.  
---
If someone wants to start a group and use those loot rules, go for it, seen plenty of Live Strat spam with 1st orb on reserve.  Not worth my time.  Same vein as people controlling group comp to not have loot competition.  
---
If someone messaged me when I was looking for a tank with that, I‚Äôd laugh at them.  There is no content hard enough in a 5 man, short of a dearth of tanks, that would induce me to pay them because they are ‚Äúso geared!1!1!1!!!‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs laughable justification that really are the icing on the cake.
---
Yup. Lionheart till Forever.  
---
Savage Gladiator Chest until AQ 40  
---
Hand of Justice until, probably naxx?
---
Kek
---
Now you‚Äôre just being MEAN.
---
Had that with the demon for the staff/offhand quest - feared him off the lock who was about to be killed, we finished him together and then the other lock helped me kill mine. No emotes needed other than /ty and /bye.
---
I can and will, but not hardcore, and idk if that's what's required to be decent
---
No it doesn't, but ironically your post is an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. 
---
Dunning-Kruger states that you can learn self-assessment, and that professionals are generally good at assessing themselves. So no, it doesn't apply to "even the smart ones".
---
This sounds like an imp name.
---
Cringe name and cringe yell...5/7 cringe would cringe again
---
You can unlock those on the default blizzard ui. But I would recommend MoveAnything, like the name indicates, it allows you to move literally anything, a bit hard to get used to, but once you get it down it's super useful.
---
A good tank is more likely to be taken places.  If you are consistent and good at tanking, it's not too difficult to get taken if you have a group who does it regularly.
---
If you are looking to go in a PUG type situation it is more likely to work better as DPS.  Even if a raid is pugging, they probably already have their tank and are simply looking for people to fill slots.
---
I mean.... you seem like you got triggered...
---
This.
---
The default state is not grouped.
---
You‚Äôre presuming he has 10k gold to pay
---
Yeah, rogues are easy mode. They can't kill you quick enough, and when you make the comeback from their early burst they're dead rather quickly. Other warriors is gonna come down to pure skill, obviously, but Shaman's are hard to kill as well, which isn't immediately obvious from theorycrafting, because they can kite really well with frostshock and the slow totem. Hunters can kite you around almost as well as a mage can...
---
No, this is a well documented bug. Priest shield doesn‚Äôt have its protection value reduced at all when a melee enemy crits on them.
---
It‚Äôs causing shields to last much longer than they should. Multiple priests have tested and proved it.
---
It‚Äôs working as intended with spell crits though.
---
I was trying to let this guy know he needed a mithril casing for the robot gorilla in Ungoro and the guy starts yelling at me, saying idk what I'm talking about because he's 'using a guide'.
---
People incapable of questioning their own knowledge are the worst.
---
...snowier snow
---
You're probably going to have to do some shopping for a guild, but just set it out front about your prospective raid attendance.   See how the GM reacts, and choose what works for you.  Its good that you already understand that loot goes first to consistent players, so as long as you're at peace with that you should be fine.
---
Yeah it sucks but all you have to do is add them then close the program on task manager. It doesn‚Äôt have to be running to work.
---
Gems were the best, and reforging was awesome too! I could go full mastery as a destro lock instead of being a metaslace afflict lock and was able to compete at a high level... Now everyone is the same special snowflake, so no one is....
---
Yea this is a lil confusing, it takes way less time to skin a mob than to type out all these messages?
---
&gt; In other words, you can do something with the goal to trigger someone, without needing to witness it.
---
Cool dudes don't look back at explosions
---
Yeah that guy's a fucking dunce but I'm telling you right now if you tell others to stop calling people retards on an online game you'll probably be harrassed even more.
---
Simple.
---
Back in Vanilla, everyone who played a healer class accepted they would be asked to heal in instances. Everyone who played a tank class, notably warriors, accepted they would be asked to tank.
---
Fast forward to Classic. Healer classes still heal, but the majority of warriors flat out refuse to. I've lost count the number of times where my druid was brought in to tank because the two warriors in the group insisted on just DPSing. And druids are MUCH less common than warriors.
---
You can also cheese the Lyceum by walking on top of the ledges on the side of the room, allows you to evade all the packs until the altars that need to be lit.
---
In a different game I play I managed to get my actual first name. Which is a very common name (just looked it up, and it was in the top 20 boy names from 1980-2010). I do get whispers about buying it regularly, but I have never gotten any threats over it. That's crazy.
---
BRD, Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, Un'goro Crater, you could start Feralas. Really at 50+ your options just explode for questing zones. Felwood is good for 53-54, then you have the plaguelands at 55, and Winterspring for 56+. There's a bunch of quests in Silithus that are good for 58-59, and of course there's a new dungeon every two levels, most of which are ridiculous xp if you do the quests associated with them.
---
"Someday, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me."
---
Shouldn't be the case. The appropriate rank is probably just not trainable from the class trainers. See if the spell book is on the auction house.
---
If you didn't know all classes have a handful of spells that have an additional rank that you have to get from spell books that drop from raids. They're BoE though.
---
I didn't realize until this go around that your pet stops 'eating' when he attacks. So if you feed him and immediately send him in to fight it just cancels that food. So much wasted Roasted Quail last go around.
---
One of our first UBRS runs we had both drop and one of the Rogues won both, needless to say he got lot of various whispers as people told their friends/guilds.  
---
Almost as good as us managing to complete the UBRS key after 2 runs of LBRS and later on even having 1 run where all the gems dropped.
---
I totally got a mage named Flag I thought was good
---
alliance can use the flight path at ratchet
---
It's possible that the rates are off  or were buffed at some point in Vanilla and not documented, therefore the high chance in Classic for bindings match up with their "reference" client.
---
I mean my other toon is a Fury Warrior, so if I'm ever feeling down I can just go play him. I'll probably just end up having my priest be my PVP toon and warrior be PVE.
---
Same with Ashkandi.  Its damn near impossible to get into runs as a pug healer.
---
Thankfully guild has caught up now and we have some tanks, but i actually took a break a week or two ago because it was just impossible to get into a strat/scholo run as a healer.
---
PVP server right?
---
i demand obedience
---
I started going between Hillsbrad and Ashenvale at that point, quests should be very doable and chain you up to higher levels. I went to 1k Needles in my early 30s.
---
I stole 4 devilsaur leather from the filthy horde yesterday by sapping or blinding them as they start skinning and forcing them to watch me take it. Feels good
---
Oh, actually, pinning down people who try to weasel out of their **completely and totally wrong premises** is how I like to spend my downtime at work. This is leisure to me. You're just wrong and don't want to admit it for some reason so you're trying to change the subject to me being 'anal.' Nope, you're just wrong. It's the most relaxing thing in the world to me to point out how wrong you are, because you make it so easy. 
---
No one said engage came only from Star Trek. No one.
---
If you can get some of the items required for a few quests in Badlands I would start there. You can grab the Nifty Stopwatch which is a boon for those without a mount. The only caveat is that you have to run through several Alliance heavy areas to get there.
---
And why is that, exactly? Warriors have always been considered a hard counter to rogues in classic.
---
I dont really get what youre saying. Both zones have a horde and a alliance town, and both zones are on the continent thats mostly Alliance controlled.
---
It's ok, I was classically trained on Battletoads, Dark Souls is a cakewalk.
---
Go play Retail, it's tailored just for you, you'll love it!
---
The point is that if you can sell a bag, that tailoring level is basically cost neutral. Making other things tends to result in a net loss. 
---
The camping for the pattern (along with the gloves which are also great for levelling) is silly but you can't deny how good the recipes are if you manage to get one.
---
I don't know if that is accurate, there are some "actions" that can stack in a macro, like changing your warrior stance doesn't use up your one action. I don't know the exact rules for this but I don't think it's as simple as one click one action
---
Play any meme spec all you like just don't try to say it's better than a standard comp.
---
Those work just fine. /e is for gesturing, it's not /s(saying)
---
Yeah it does suck but all you have to do is end the task after you download the addons you want.
---
I wanted Baz but some [presumed] asshole already had it so I went with Baaz. Fuck foreign characters. I‚Äôd gladly pay 10g to have Baz tho, and check regularly if it‚Äôs become available.
---
Druid is tough. You honestly have no real opener until level 32 when you get Ravage. Shapeshifting is super mana intensive so use it sparingly. Obviously try and open in Cat form with Ravage, get some bleeds, shift out and apply Nature's Grasp as soon as possible to get a snare on them any way possible. Try to root them then get a Moonfire on them. Shift into travel form and get out of range to get some breathing room. Shift out and get a Regrowth + Rejuv on yourself. Shift back into bear and charge immediately (especially if you see them casting). If you see a cast coming interrupt with Bash. At this point you should still be close to full health with your Heal and HoTs ticking and they should be in rough shape. Your mana will likely be low though so try and finish them in Bear form. 
---
Travel form is your go to snare removing form. Its way less mana intensive and allows you to create distance which is huge.
---
Sorry just remembered your previous post about Getz and thought I'd check up!
---
Had a great moment over the weekend as alliance on Kromcrush in STV. I was ganked several times on my way to kill trolls for the tusk drops. Finally there, there was a shaman the same level and I /waved at him. We killed mobbed peacefully. We ran out of spawns and there was the group inside ruins, so I pointed at one hoping he would aggro it and I would aggro the other. It worked. 
---
We stayed in the area for 30-45 mins taking turns tagging the mobs and helping the other kill it. A mage kept coming to kill him and wouldn't listen to me when I tried to tell him to stop. Poor guy got killed a few times while /cry /wave to me as he died. He kept returning though. Once or twice he managed to get to wolf and run away to disappear for 10 minutes only to return again. 
---
Eventually a rogue he was partied with joined and I was the one human in a full horde party killing named troll mobs. They defended me against horde trying to gank me, and I was able to successfully mind control and buff them. We were all understanding when my mind controls held them in place too long for the mage to catch up and kill them, and when they would accidentally Windfury kill me. 
---
Easily the coolest moment I had in classic. I thought about making a new post. If anyone on horde Kromcrush wants to thank them for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Shambulanc√´ and peekaboo I think.
---
That green offhand is preraid bis for mage...
---
Can we stop perpetuating the Gnome hate? Every UD player is a piece of shit but I don't mention it incessantly.
---
What ur doing is good, don't listen to the idiot that says firewalls are doing more bad than good. With that attitude is how you compromise ur PC and get fucked.
---
Seems they're talking about OP's comment further below. Weird way to use reddit but oh well.
---
You can enter Molten Core without attunement. The attunement just gives you access to a shortcut.
---
I doubt they do. I checked one of the gold sites I got spammed with and 1k good was like $500. Doubt anyone is dropping coin for 40k even if sellers have it
---
That doesnt do jack shit when theres very, very few tanks and those tanks already have healers that they always run with.
---
I had the same issue on my server until the tanks in guild caught up.
---
Yup!
---
Whoever gets the first hit gets credit. If something aggros but they never swing at it you can pull it and get credit.
---
I assume they pulled it twice so that both could get credit if necessary.
---
This one I don‚Äôt understand. Are they afraid of having competition or something?  I‚Äôve only seen this after being fanned by a rogue in your typical post-fight scenario.
---
I have helped numerous alliance on my warrior and I would say it's around 50/50 whether or not that they attack me following my help, and out of that 50% if the person has a pet it seems to be a 100% chance they will turn on me.
---
I have stopped helping Hunters and Warlocks of the opposing factions simply cause they all seem to be dicks.
---
12g on my server. shew! Guess ill head back to EPL. Get some experience as well as hope for drops.
---
The only thing I play in classic like BFA is my crippling addiction to alts. Also I get frustrated at my prot Warrior and will often switch to my hunter.
---
youre fighting bad locks then lol
---
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
This actually has a definition: Mondegreen -  A mondegreen is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony, in a way that gives it a new meaning.
---
I still don‚Äôt get it
---
My tanking powers have DOUBLED since we last met.
---
This is hilarious, thanks
---
I could go for a median fry right about now
---
Yes I'm dual welding. Maybe it's just good luck on my part but I feel like I DPS mobs down a little quicker and end fights with a little more health than when I was Arms. Could be the RNG is on my side when it comes to misses.
---
Meanwhile my hunter Skeetshot is just fine
---
Yeah all you have to do is click install, wait 5 seconds and you‚Äôre good to go. You can also update all at the same time in a few seconds.
---
As you should. I don't trust non-priest undead players and I'm on the horde side. I think the threat level of being ganked by horde is undead&gt;orc&gt;troll&gt;tauren.
---
I always kind of hate when I'm trying to be civil to enemy players, and members of my own faction gotta run in on a Red Is Dead kill spree.

I got 60 Water and 40 Food. Had to deal a mage for additional water later down the raid. He gave me 40 Water and 20 Food. Seriously, DONT LET YOUR WARLOCKS STARVE!
---
Exactly this.  You should be focusing on DoT'ing us, and slowing us.  Don't let us stand behind you ever.
---
The stealth part is just all luck.  You either spot us with Flare/AoE or we give away our position due to being to close.  Really though, the stealth is the rogues staple.  They aren't gonna make it easy to counter
---
Ill chalk it up to being in tinker town which is rather makeshift and sudden right? The gnomes are still fleeing gnomerang when the game starts right?
---
Annual performance review is coming up at work. I think I'll try this as I sit down for the meeting with our director. Surely it works IRL with raises right?

Herod has them at about 16-17g a piece and Faerlina is like 20g

I think it's just a pun with the verb eat

read man... im talking about pug dungeons
---
I was killing murlocs cause I was a bar and half from my next level. Some guy was doing the quest for them and invited me cause he thought I was doing the same. Yeah bud, I'll stick around and help you get all your quest items. He told me when he was done and asked how many more I needed. I just told him I got my last one a minute ago.
---
Makes sense. Much like the UD mage/rogue combo.
---
Y'all are getting ~~paid~~ bindings?
---
Ive (prot war) got a macro to reply with. "Can't, I'm a healer".  Bandaid spec is hugely underappreciated.
---
I saw no one and started escort quest. 15 secs later people appear. Throw me an invite. Join party. Ask "why did you start it dipshit" and proceed to leave party and pull everything in sight to try and kill me and escort. Checked /1.. nothing. No whispers. Nothing indicating they were near or needed it. Moral of the story, don't be a dick just bc you're upset you missed out and will need to wait. 
---
I understand there are situations where people will run up and start with you standing right there. But barring circumstances such as this, no excuse to root for someone's failure or to try to directly cause it. Toxic behavior is unacceptable. There are enough assholes in the world already. Not saying this is the circumstance you're talking about, but your post screams lack of empathy and consideration of someone else's position or view point. As others have mentioned, /1 isn't open and visible for everyone to see. So even though the circumstances above may not match your post exactly, the lack of empathy can lead to similar situations and outcomes.
---
Why is it off-center?
---
I still haven't even seen it drop, let alone been fortunate enough to lose a roll on it.
---
It wasn't too bad when I still pre-60. The farming is still good XP, right? But now I am 60. And I've got my UBRS key. So any run that doesn't result in that crossbow gains me nothing.
---
Wait seriously?
---
fuckin blimey, I've made the executive decision to not bother with that nonsense. Thanks for doing the math!
---
Since you are getting towards the end of the grind I would say pumping up that Int would be a huge advantage.

If you don't comprehend the concept of trash talk, then no one will ever be able to explain it to you.
---
Which class?
---
Probably going to be difficult to be casual and a main tank for raids.
---
"Loansharks R Us". Friendly neighborhood nonprofit organization.
---
Well, you don't need to kill him to speak to the NPC.  
---
An alliance killed it just as I got there and I was able to talk to the ghost without lifting a finger.
---
In detail: The cellar ist under the city Lordaeron.
---
I mean, chances are because people who are "serious" about PvP rolled Orc for stun resist or UD for WotF. Makes sense that those races would be more likely to gank you
---
It does! I've lost it twice already!

Just google gamblers fallacy and you will understand why you‚Äôre wrong

If you‚Äôre horde on GROB, just type /join Uber, ask for a port to Blackrock Mountain, pay the warlock 1g, walk the short distance to Badlands.

I'm allergic to cheese so I get a burger and ask for no cheese and the fuckers almost ALWAYS put cheese on that shit so I have to go back and have them make it again. Like, how the fuck do you do MORE work than you have to? It's not like they forgot an extra ingredient. DON'T PUT CHEESE ON IT! And I say this as someone who has worked in many fast food restaurants. It's really not that hard.
---
yes, sure, but this isn't the blizzard method which is what we were talking about 
---
plus you would need block and mana gems for every single pull which means you make nowhere near the advertised gold per hour anyway
---
I did the tanaris quest to retrieve some equipment  from a bug‚Äôs hive with a night elf warrior as forsaken priest. Would have been an annoying quest to solo, but it went smoothly as hell together. Fun times, I enjoy those unexpected alliances.
---
A-Me good gorilla!
---
Had this happen last night.
---
I don't need to reach you, only my crafted shot does and at over 300ft/sec it will have no problem.
---
Feral druid and without dungeons at the moment :)
---
So is TB the only horde city with a druid trainer? I can't imagine there's a druid hanging out in the Undercity... That really is frustrating. IF doesn't have one either, but Stormwind's just a tram ride away so I can't complain.
---
I got 10 in 2 hours yesterday from Toxic Horrors in Felwood. I'm on a medium pop server and did it early in the morning so I had the spot all to myself.
---
So all I need to do is wear 3 items with 2% hit cap to reach the 6% hit cap I need?
---
I think it's basically asking if people want to do the dungeon for reasons other than the reserved loot. I don't see anything wrong with asking since it's not like you're pressured to run with them or anything.
---
Haha I'll never help lock or hunter, they have it easy enough already!
---
It's only 10% at honored. The only other mount discount will be available in phase 2 by reaching Rank 3 in the honor system.
---
The only time it was really a thing/worked on wow was for Achievements, tbh.  It was kind of a legit thing since you could get carried through AoTC (or before that was a thing, just the achievement for the raid) because people would want you to link it to get into runs and it was just about impossible to get into them if you didnt have it already.
---
Basically no point on Classic, though lol
---
German client needs german spellnames, the rest can stay.
---
Skeram? Saw this flying to hillsbrad lol
---
Pretty easy to figure out.  Shadow oil is 15% chance to do a lvl 3 shadowbolt when it hits, ignoring any internal CD it might have that's an added average of 8.4 dmg per swing, so once you factor in swing speed it's probably less than that.
---
You'd have to pick a sharpening stone and figure that part out yourself.
---
You may get lucky sometimes, and depending on your talents you may be generating some healing that helps with survivability, but arms also just has a better early toolkit when it comes to tanking and cleaving to hold aggro.
---
TM, AM, Sweeping Strikes. All that stuff should be helping substantially from pull to pull, especially if you pool rage correctly
---
Thanks mate. That's pretty damn inspirational. I suppose I'm sitting around mile 20 or so right now.
---
if you are nowhere near 5-6% hit, you are better off as arms unfortunately. as you have stated above the chance to miss is way too high when you're below the hit cap.
---
as for the ring, keep it till 60. you'll need it.
---
Arcane has never really been a power house in Vanilla that I can recall. The only time I specced into it when I played was deep enough to get PoM when I had specced fire.
---
Ice right now will be the raiding spec due to the large amount of Fire based enemies.
---
Don't switch to DW until just before your first raid.  Arms is still better in dungeons and such
---
I like Method Xaryu and Method Venruki. They‚Äôre mage PvPers though
---
Just be prepared for a rough grind. It's likely a 2% drop rate at best and I killed earth elementals in Silithus for two hours and got one essence.
---
I'm working on the robe but instead I'm just farming \~40g/hour and buying the essences.
---
I'm not totally interested in getting the speediest kills. Mostly just want a change of pace, to get myself accustomed to holy for raids, and to have some fun with a spell that's just been gathering dust. Thanks for the info.
---
I was in the Barrens with a quest to kill some cat, Echeyakee.  So I get there, and there's a dwarf hunter.  He has a cat named LetMeTameIt.
---
He points at the corpse of my quest mob, and points at LetMeTameIt.  I nod.  I move back, and sit and wait.  More trash cats spawn, we kill them.  He's killing, I'm skinning.  I'm waiting for the respawn.  He keeps pointing at LetMeTameIt.
---
Then some more horde come along, blow their horn, and summon Echeyakee - and then kill it.  Dwarf starts to /cry on me.  D'oh, the horn - I'd been hanging out with this dwarf killing respawns, and didn't read the quest text.  I gotta blow my horn.
---
So, I wait for the other horde to leave, then blow my horn.  I /dance with the dwarf while he tames his white cat.  He thanks me, bows, and bunnyhops off.  I go to blow my horn again so I can finish this damned quest .. but there's no horn.  It was consumed.  I gotta drop the quest, and walk all the way back to fekkin crossroads.
---
I hope he still uses that cat.  If I see him without it, ima kill him.

---
Is there a discord like fight club but actually let's you ask questions?
---
It makes it easy to lose track of what stance you're in, is extremely likely to repeatedly clip rage, and makes using stances for their effects (ie defensive stance when about to be bursted) much more difficult.
---
Pit a warrior with stance-bound ability macros and one used to independent stance control against each other and the latter will perform better, he simply has more control over what hes doing.
---
I don't think any good guild is wasting money on consumables for MC. Unless you want to stockpile for naxx already or are aiming for 15-20 man clears.
---
Aggro radius is so wrong in this game
---
I assume you meant skinning not LW, but definitely mining or herbalism.  Which one will depend on your server.
---
You made a big fucking mistake dropping tailoring and enchanting, youll regret that
---
It's really hard to make this transition, I'm with you...starting to stack mp5 and +healing over the traditional int/spirit gear.
---
However...it does make sense.
---
The [wowclassicbis.com](https://wowclassicbis.com) gear for resto druids gives a total of 511 +healing and 9 Mp5, but only 30 int and 85 spirit (before enchants anyway).
---
That means that every healing spell cast is +511 though, which results in greater mana effectiveness, being able to downrank spells and needing fewer spells to achieve the same result.  Higher spirit than int makes sense given the druid talents that allow 15% mana regen even while casting, plus synergy with innervate.
---
It's a little weird making this turn away from mana pool stacking, but I think the net effect seems logical when you can see the efficiency.
---
Can't stand this kinda stuff. Yesterday I found a warrior LFM for Ubrs but when I went to join him, he said I couldn't because he'd have competition for the Rend swords, then switched his adv to lfm caster and ranged only dps
---
&gt; "Oh bother" only comes from winnie the pooh.
---
Yup, no other instances of putting the word "oh" before the word "bother" could ever happen in the English language unless it was a Winnie the Pooh reference.
---
You could join a friendly guild and ask for assistance through them. Or if you are familiar with the quest and know it‚Äôs going to be a long chain try to find a group or partner when starting it.
---
Yes, you should report him now. Don't wait. This kind of threat is something they usually take seriously.
---
From what I gathered it is just 10% for honored and potentially another 10% for Rank 3 once the Honorsystem is avaiable.
---
i hit 42 last night and i have only 40gold .. no mount yet :(
---
Whatchu talkin bout man? Thats not true, so idk what you base it on
---
I would until the point where you get sword spec.  Once you complete the quest for poisons having the fast off hand will be ideal because it will apply poisons more frequently.  Easier to find fast daggers than fast swords.  That poison quest is kind of tough.  Make sure to look it up because certain mobs die fast to specific rogue moves on that one.
---
dunning-kruger
---
Horde scum. Alliance trash.
---
If you follow the lore, you would know that‚Äôs not true.
---
At 50+ you need to start focusing more on +Frost damage or spell power gear.
---
All good. No issues getting groups for anything, maybe slightly outnumbered when in contested zones but enough people around to put up a fight
---
10% honored, and I think another 10% at a certain pvp rank?
---

you missed the joke...
---
I won them in two consequential pugs. I‚Äôm aware Vis‚Äôkag is the better MH but with limited OH selection it seems I‚Äôll be using these two in junction.
---
Or mind soothe if humanoids. Pretty sure I never once did this in vanilla due to my tiny preteen brain, but it‚Äôs pretty nice.
---
I haven't been reporting the bots only the safe spot killers. But if you really doubt they are botting I have trouble taking you seriously. You are pretty much telling me I know nothing and am a complete idiot, when I have a pretty good idea how it works and how to do it.
---
Current low bids on these are 95s each. If we were looking at that price instead of the buyout price as the base, I'm still offering a 5% discount, which would be pretty close to the AH cut, I think.
---
This guy countered with what would've been a 28% discount on the bid price, or a 31.25% discount off the buyout price, which I'd consider insulting. He was looking for a deal that I wasn't willing to give him. Maybe the way I presented my counter argument might have been considered rude, but it was in response to what I considered rude as well, and was meant to highlight the large discrepancy in his offer vs. the value of the item.
---
Rather than barter back with me, he simply ignored me instead. No harm done, I guess since I just sold them all for 1g each on the AH anyway.
---
But Baron's cape and Blackstone ring are from dungeon drops?  I think I'm misunderstanding your premise here.
---
Nice, I actually just loaded up FF14 for ther first time. I've been a FF fan forever, can't believe it took me this long to look into the mmo
---
How are tanks any worse than healers at farming?
---
Exactly, I never touch a mob until I am sure the tank has aggro.
---
What's a good way to make money off of Herbalism/Alchemy? Herbalism is at abput 205, Alch at about 160. Any particular herbs or potions that are worth farming for? I'm lvl 34 and feeling kinda behind on my mount savings.
---
A feral druid won't have the eye-popping numbers most other DPS classes can produce.  
---
However, you're a lot more durable as a druid.  You're more likely to win longer fights if you can survive long enough. But, if PvP fights last long enough you'll very frequently have other people jump in which can completely change the dynamic.
---
Overall, just be super opportunistic as a feral druid and you'll be fine!
---
in theory yes.
---
Also the hit cap is 6% against lvl 60 enemies. 
---
You want 9% for lvl 63 and boss enemies. ¬®
---
The "hit cap" you are talking about is for just your special attacks (yellow numbers over your target). So at 6% you will always hit with bloodthirst on a lvl 60 target, at 9% you will always hit with bloodthirst on a lvl 63 target. 
---
But for you to hit with melee attacks (White damage numbers), then the hit cap is way higher. I think its 15% or more for lvl 63 targets.
---
Wholesome
---
Classic Onyxia is significantly easier compared to private servers. As are all Classic raids. Naxx won‚Äôt be any different.
---
I run a lot of spellcleave groups. The warlock makes or breaks the group with their pulls. And competent Locks will still be right there at the top of the DPS chart. Plus with the ability to summon idiots from all over the world. I love Warlocks.
---
Well I made a couple of points that you just dismissed with a "muh mage instant dps op", such hypocrisy.
---
Duels are so much more than that, a cs being joked or successful can decide a fight. Instants are not enough to burst through 2 health bars.
---
Also try to tank dungeons where you are a level or so above your dps if possible, and the mobs as well. also be vocal, you run the show. If you are having trouble, make your own group of competent people, and stop joining other groups.
---
I just hit 60 on my druid and tanked the whole way up.
---
You summed the issue up quiet good. I agree with your opinion, but if no one else agree one has to adapt. 
---
The problem comes into play mostly when the 2 approaches clash.
---
I discovered yesterday that you need to do it before they target you back - if they have you targeted, you just end up MCing them and then buffing yourself...
---
That's not for you to judge.
---
/2 and /4 are the toxic channels, most /1 is reasonable engagement appropriate to what you're working on.  Other than perhaps barrens chat?
---
But my point is if you've decided to ignore the social aspect of the game and ignore /1 while you tag an elite or escort...I'm not going to feel bad when you die alone.
---
Its a lot closer looking tho lol. I think dwarves can at least see the tabletop
---
I knew saving it all that time would finally pay off.

Yeah sorry if I wasn‚Äôt clear the easiest way to get into a dungeon was to heal no one really wants shadow priest dps which is why mage aorta was most wanted as a healer I reaped the exp benefits and when I wasn‚Äôt in dungeons being shadow and questing was easy!
---
Trying to DPS as holy won't get you prepared for raids at all, and there isn't really any difference between healing as holy and shadow, besides having 2.5s casts instead of 3s.
---
I've been using starshards a lot when healing dungeons or questing as holy, because it does "okay" damage while costing pretty much nothing.
---
Wow, I feel like a fool now not knowing there was a shaman trainer in SoS.  Woulda made leveling there in my 30's and 40's a lot easier.
---
Mark of ford requires Live strat.
---
I was leveling my alt and needed a quest mob, I asked for an invite but he ignored me, I tried to invite him but he declined. I ended up blinking past the trash, killing the boss and then I Nova the trash and adds on top of him and he died. Didn't even feel a little bad lol.
---
Exactually the worst part about it is that it would work!
---
What the difference between all the different types of BRD runs people are advertising in chat for (arena, anger etc). Are any of these full runs?
---
Also is scholo key worth getting?
---
So sick and tired of people shitting in whispers and immediately ignoring.  
---
Would be interesting like this - you can ignore only if the person responded to you.  
---
If you already ignored the person, but want to send one more reply, this reply automatically removes the person from ignore list.
---
Or atleast step ladders!

Ensure the mobs die, and immediately drink after pulls.  Ignore the haters because regardless of what the plebs who are level 25-35 say, LFG chat is poppin for mages.  I constantly see AOE cleave spam groups, and let me tell you that I will not go into BRD without a mage.
---
tll;dr play a mage if you want and ignore whatever flak people give you

That's some serious lag.

I think you have to be in range and targeting them for all the other options
---
Stonetalon actually has an FP for Alliance at the peak. Badlands requires you to run from Thelsamar every time.
---
Definitely does not need to be within the next 10 min and also OP probably knows already.
---
Oh I understand trash talk. I don‚Äôt understand how ‚Äúgo back to retail‚Äù is considered an insult when the same exact situation happens there too. 
---
I‚Äôm used to people screaming ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù or something else dumb.
---
First time going up to the FP in Stonetalon while I was horde I was confused. The place was 98% horde and 1 alliance guy who just flew in. There's like 4 or 5 NPC's there. What a strange spot.
---
Its obviously a hunter weapon.
---
There is no aoe on any of the bosses, all mages do is spam frostbolt.

Yes deathbringer is def. your best offhand at the moment.

Yup. I want to say either Wrath (when lowering all the costs) or Cata.
---
You're a traitor!!!!!!!

Feels good, sadly that mob spawn is not so long.
---
In roulette, if results are black, black, black, black; what is the chance the next result would be red? (Assuming only black and red, let‚Äôs forget about green). 
---
The answer is 50% chance of being red. 
---
Same for Rag. None of the prior events have ANY effect on the next loot table. 3% is 3%.
---
You can Tune a Piano but you cannot Tuna fish!
---
You should only use hemo with swords, and also hemo is not worth a debuff slot and will get you in trouble if the raid leader has any idea of what they're doing.
---
Just remember, you are the tank, they can't do the run w/o you. If you leave the group they are out of luck. The only two spots that are indispensable are the tank and the healer.
---
If you explain politely and they keep dps'ing before you have aggro, you will eventually wipe and can leave the group without guilt. No one needs that aggravation or repair bill, especially in higher dungeons or raids.
---
Blizzard gave locks the possibility to banish to claim two mobs at the same time.. must be griefing.

Arcanite transmutes are always an easy way to make money for clicking a button.  
---
For raiders, right now fire protection, shadow protection, and armor potions are in decent demand due to people raiding MC. Same with wizard oil and agility potions (and the other attribute variants.)
---
You can also stock up on free action potions (FAP's) for the PvP patch since people will be wanting to eat those things like candy!
---
Really just depends if you want to go the quantity over quality route (agility pots, fire protection pots, etc) or quality over quantity route (flasks).
---
I got mega ganked and corpse camped in BRM by ally scums. Death to them all. This is propaganda.
---
Niiiiice...
---
yeah but think of the 10s of silver you could have made by rushing the lesser and greater magic wand recipes
---
Maybe that's why it's so hard to get a horde group. People think you have to run all the way there :p.
---
Yeah the alliance has a realllllly good reason to be xenophobic.
---
I've left a couple of guilds, if I leave I give my reasons to the person who invited and they've been understanding. I tell them no hard feelings and look forward to grouping with them sometime and they've been pretty cool about it, I've repeatedly pugged with the GM of a guild I left.
---
He said on bosses he topped the chart. He said he lagged behind everywhere else probably because of either multiple mobs or too short fights.
---
39 Twink warriors with crusader hitting cloth for 700 damage whirl winds are amazing.
---
BRD is not linear, there are multiple paths/routes you can take inside the instance and they are advertising the routes/bosses they will be hitting during that particular run.
---
I personally grabbed the scholo key on my main back during vanilla and will be doing the same this time around whenever I manage to get high enough!
---
Players that do the 'whisper then ignore' thing aren't ready.
---
I go to global LFG and let people know that person's giving away gold to the first whisper who can correctly answer what CLASS Sylvannas is.
---
People love answering trick questions.
---
The exact same way it's helpful for hunter. So you don't clip your auto attack
---
For engineering I've made alot of scopes and a profit off those atleast but some things require a money sink in engineering.... I just hit 285 and learned thorium shell which I'll just use for guildies when they want bullets or they can trade them to a npc for thorium arrows to get to 300.
---
Two rogue questions
---
1. For dungeons, what is preferred spender for max dps min threat?
---
2. Possible for mace rogue to be viable at any stage?  Or is sword and dagger always far superior?
---
Definitely lag
---
You didn't do any quests?
---
Spec does not determine which spells you're using in vanilla. Deep frost tree gives you iceblock and ice barrier, which do nothing for PVE damage, while arcane gives you arcane power. So most PVE mages will be spec'd arcane but still cast frostbolts.
---
I've done this for alliance enough. I see a squish squish accidentally overpull, I just pop to bear to challenging roar it off them and let them kill it more safely.
---
I'd imagine, going back to World of Roguecraft, that an experienced rogue would know if he could take you or not. And if not, would just escape or hide from you.
---
Can confirm, am old and I've never seen an episode of Star Trek, although I still know who Piccard is.
---
Seems weird to have Baron cape on there when it requires more luck and time to get than the BiS crossbow and headpiece from bosses that appear earlier in that dungeon. I'm currently rocking a +15 agi green cloak but I've also seen some with 9agi/9int.
---
Also add Warmonger as the weapon. It's a BOE 2H sword with 3% hit which is absurdly good until you can afford a scope.
---
While heroic strike is queued your offhands attacks don't have the duelwield penalty which means you are hitcapped on offhand attacks, people are using a macro to start and stop heroic strike right before and after attacks so they can get this bonus at all times even if they can't afford the rage to heroic strike.
---
There aren't too many healers, there just aren't enough tanks.
---
I had planned to go herb/alch but a great portion of the community told me to wait to get alch until 50. So I went herb/skinning I hit 40 and asked if I should swap and the community still advised to wait until 50.
---
Seems like Alchemy won't make much money until PvP is prevalent for HK or you hit 300 and have access to herbs at 60.
---
I stashed all my herbs in bank alts (2 are full now) and I recently ran through to calculate how much I could have.  It looks like if I sold everything now and undercut everyone's current prices I'd get about ~30-35g.
---
I noticed Stranglekelp sells very well and it has been one of the main herbs I farm/sell for gold.  There's a handful of good farming spots but one off the top of my head is the entire coast south of ratchet.  I just run up and down for a couple hours and end up with stacks of the stuff.
---
... I'm so happy in the jongle
---
Get your sheeps DIALED. You see that pat coming that‚Äôs about to aggro? Sheep it right as it does. Your healer got aggro and is trying to run for his life? Frost nova + sheep. These are things that will make you look like a pro and only require a little situational awareness. Brownie points if you hand out a stack of food and water to everyone in the group BEFORE they ask and make sure EVERYONE has int. Int helps melee train weapons and make sure it doesn‚Äôt fall off. These are all easy things that will get you invited back to groups.
---
&gt; Hi there! Would you like to do UBRS with us? We need a tank.

Similar situation, was in a 'native-language' leveling guild, but all the active and chatty people left once they hit 60. I stayed at 60 but the guild is dead and i dont know where to go..

It also wins out over Curse by letting you Update all for free and not trying to paywall it. 
---
Saves time when you have a ton of addons, instead of sitting there and clicking Update individually.
---
Warriors: bleed and kite

Mages: the usual + free action potion
---
I‚Äôm a noob mage but here‚Äôs my dungeon run down:
---
- Don‚Äôt nova EVERYTHING. Mobs in the nova will just slap anyone nearby. Potentially messing with the tanks aggro. Save your Novas as emergencies. 
---
- If there‚Äôs a kill order marked follow that, don‚Äôt aoe. 
---
- Along the same lines; I tend to avoid AOE all together unless someone in the party does it first. 
---
- Be careful with blink. If you pull aggro stay near the tank, don‚Äôt blink into another trash pack and pull more. 
---
- You can save your tanks a lot of hassle by using your CS well. Use it to interrupt annoying moves or pull mobs to you 
---
- Sheeping: nobody has EVER moaned at me for sheeping stuff. If you feel it‚Äôll help, drop a sheep. At the very least it can mitigate incoming damage. 
---
- I tend to not AOE packs smaller than 4. It‚Äôs just inefficient mana use and if I frostbolt them all I do similar damage without needing a minute break between every pull. 
---
- Be ready to fire blast runners in dungeons so they don‚Äôt pull more mobs. 
---
- utilise fire ward/ice barrier to soak damage. If you just have 1 mob on you rather than panicking and running
---
Farm fire elementals during slow hours for elemental fire. Should make you a decent chunk of cash.
---
You're right, it doesn't help at all with giving you info. Just flashy and ultimately pointless, so I agree.
---
If I get a reply I‚Äôll announce it to everyone so the people of Myzrael can rejoice
---
There are a million guides for every aspect of this game, you can be new and informed.
---
The Alliance is organized and working on getting actual shit done, instead of ganking for no reason or trying to raid SW failing miserable like the horde being doing every weekend
---
I macro my stances into my abilities for ease of use when tanking, because I can hit key X faster than I can hit key X + Y.
---
That said, I also have a macro for the three stances keybound so I can switch manually if necessary. Best of both worlds.
---
It's called wasting your and another individual's time.
---
Runeblade, Diamond Flask, and the Bloodfang 8-piece set. However, none of these have been tested but are only datamined (but the datamine has not only been 100% accurate so far but is also backed up by old comments from 2005).
---
The premise is to avoid as much of the dungeon grind as possible because it is boring, while still remaining as close as possible to preraid BiS performance.
---
Those two items have no equivalents that are even remotely close to them for a while to come.
---
So while you're not completely avoiding it (can do if you choose ofc), it's as "casual" as it gets since you are free to  earn the required money in the manner you see fit (some maybe from maraudon while grabbing the ring solo).
---
I hope that clarifies it :)
---
This is true. It is also one of the reasons why Human Warriors and Orc Warriors are such strong tanks. Their weapon skill allows them to output a LOT more threat on bosses.
---
It‚Äôs not a script per say but a one button spam. 
---
There is an in game script that will attempt to buy the pattern in slot 30 of the vendor and then close the window automatically. It detects the vendor interaction of your hot key, attempts the buy, and closes the window. 
---
All it requires is a single button spam which can be done with a lot of modern keyboards, without software. Yes they are AFK but it is not a ‚Äúbot‚Äù or ‚Äúscript‚Äù in the traditional sense. 
---
Not saying it should be supported, just giving info.
---
That's about it.  Aggro and AoE pulling are the main reason for the hate.
---
Also avoid AoEing in PvP as it uses a lot of mana, unless the time specifically calls for it.
---
Seems like main thing is to learn when to use AoE spells instead of just mindlessly spamming them because it's easy and makes numbers appear.
---
Congratulations!  I prefer vanilla wolves to the modern model.  Enjoy your 100% speed increase!
---
A guy in my guild has the name assitch
---
Yeah I get you, people are a bit lazy, that's true

Nice list man, I didn't realize that tattered leather hood is BoE equippable at 51 - gonna look for it in AH when I play today.  I appreciate you putting this together for us.

You have enough self-awareness to ask so you are already safe from being that guy.
---
But really, you already nailed it with
---
&gt;Other than obvious dungeon stuff like don't pull, try not to take agrro
---
Don't go balls out and pull packs by yourself, chill with the aoe if your tank asks it, and keep baddies off the healer and no one will complain about you
---
&gt; 58 rogue
---
Aggro problems in the dungeons for plaguelands.  You should be able to hop into anything in BRM or DM when that comes out in a couple months.
---
Is this Zandalar Tribe, EU?
---
I figured it was another warrior. Can‚Äôt exactly tell.
---
So do you respec at 58 when you start running LBRS?  Wondering if im hybrid questing and dungeoning - running BRD/LBRS/ST from 55-59, what spec would make sense? Not sure if Destro is efficient for times outside of dungeon runs.
---
I enjoy MCing off the boat, but i usually wait for it to have crossed the ocean. I enjoy dropping people in the water off the coast, not wasting their time waiting for the damn boat.
---
Yeah? Yeah? You really think that? WELL......
---
I wouldn't know. That shit costs too much rage for me to ever use it. I'd rather use cleave..... man I wish I had more AoE abilities.
---
&gt;10% at a certain pvp rank
---
Yup, rank 3
---
God, I know someone who does exactly that, and I could without a doubt see him react this way in WoW. Spot on comment
---
Never realized the name of thos quest is a hat tip to Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy. Awesome.
---
I feel you, just hit 35 last night. Progress feels good but I still have so far to go.
---
aww :)
---
Roughly around 20 runs not a single mh oh rend weapon nor truestrike shoulders. I have seen about 7 reeds
---
3%... for an individual drop. Not once did I say that the previous events change the future probability. 
---
If you do 5 games of roulette, what are the chances that you will get a red? Higher than if you play one game. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you have a higher chance of getting it *on your next game*, but the overall probability of getting a red increases *as a whole*. 
---
Are you actually implying that, if you run Molten Core 100 times, your chance of getting a Sulfuras in 100 runs is 3%? 
---
And again, I already know gamblers fallacy, I‚Äôm saying that that doesn‚Äôt have to do with overall probability, just on individual occurrences.
---
Before I level'd my priest I was thinking about druid but all my super elitist friends (whom they got bored and left already) discoiraged me from druid because of 
---
1) Druid healing is all about spamming healing touch rank 3-5-7 and druid healer is the worst. Only reason they bring a druid healer to raid is because of innervate. (While is could be true honestly a priest healer is kinda tue same at least for now. Keep renew up and spamk heal rank 1 or rank 5 when needed...but no innervate)
---
2) Druid tank is a joke and they dont exists. Nobody will take a druid tank to any PvE conte t because there are a class (warrior) thats simply much better at it (I know there are people out there saying this is bullshit and me, myself would take a druid tank anytime just as I took a shaman before and had no real problems. What I miss from modern mmos is that people are always min-maxing taking only the best while "back in the good 'ol days" I am pretty sure there was a lot of not the perfect build or class to take the job...just as a druid tank)
---
3) Druids ARE a joke. They can do everything and thats why they are the worst at everything.
---
But yeah druid was an option before my priest. I took a look at the hybrid build 0/30/21 and it looks promising on paper. A spec that can tank, heal and can be good in PvP (and assume for farming as well). But do people share with this open minded thinking as general, or its hard to get into frouos just because of you are a druid? A jack of all trades but master at none. Whats your experience?
---
Note: As for myself what I would love to do is tank/heal 5 man dungeons or UBRS, and mostly heal in raids, mostly ZG when its released. Not quite fan of the 40 man raids (and their theme) so those big raids are secondary for me. Ahh yes...and PvP. Ganking the opposite faction...specially gnomes.
---
I didn't know those additional discounts existed so yeah they were definitely added later.
---
How exactly is searching for the addon you want and clicking install demanding?
---
I don't know what class you've rolled, but as a warrior I don't have any more keybind to spare for marks. Instead I just unfold the official group thingy with the marks and the ready check button, and use that. Since you're usually marking targets when out of combat (by "usually" I actually mean 100% of times), it's not vital to have it keybound imho, as we have already enough stuff needing a keybind as a warrior
---
Might be different for paladin or drood, can't tell, haven't played them in a vanilla setting
---
Would like to know as well. Loving it for leveling, zero downtime. But i'm never first on dps meters in dungeons, usually i'm 10% behind the other dps (rogue, mage, warrior).
---
I didn't want to take a Lv 41 Rogue into ZF. (Mobs start at 44/45, bosses are 47/48)
---
Ignored.
---
Yeah, that's what I have bound in retail.  Haven't gotten around to binding them yet in classic but as I do more dungeons I def need to! Only downside is when numlock is toggled off because of autorun :)
---
TB is indeed the only horde city with a Druid trainer. I forget SW has Druid trainers and I‚Äôm assuming teldrassil does as well so that‚Äôs nice üò≠
---
This was just a lighthearted post to bring some humor to the subreddit.
---
i dont even have trade chat enabled. i just use the auction house to buy and sell stuff
---
ive seen a few guilds say they are recruiting in the lfg chat channel, but all of them are only recruiting for raids and have like a set schedule. i dont really want to commit to all that
---
20 fish, for 1g, i guess in theoryyy  if you aren't able to kill the mobs in the zone, then fishing is faster but for the lenght of time it takes to catch 20 of a fish, i could have killed all the crocolisks on that beach for more vendor trash
---
A week+ late. Definitely not the first
---
Please tell me you ganked him after.
---
You make a good amount of money simply by spamming SM
---
Probably young'ins.
---
And I can't fucking wait!
---
I second what Acegro is saying about the talent trees. One of my absolute favorite things about playing a druid in Vanilla was the options on talent trees. You can do so much to get things dialed in just as you want them.
---
Irregardless
---
I want to play on solo battlegrounds 1 2 hours a day after hitting 60.
---
I wish I could upvote this more. I played alliance druid first time around, and Darnassus is so close to moonglade it wasn't an issue. I never realized how freaking far the flight to TB is from Moonglade. Top this off with it being the only major city with a druid trainer. 
---
I've decided to take it as a blessing because I can take a much needed (long) break from the game during the flight lol.
---
That‚Äôs what the greed button is for. Need is for using the item. Need &gt; greed
---
You can spam in general in a main city, ask in trade or look for people spamming for leveling guilds. Check your server forums on wow, or check and see if you have a server Reddit page. The best way to do it is to ask in general for a leveling guild. Or a helpful or social guild. And once you end up in a guild be social and helpful to other people and they will be more apt to help you when you need it. Wow is a social game, and you kinda get outa it what you out into it. A lot of your guildies will take note of that.

awesome

Me casting Seal of Wisdom on Warriors and Rogues
---
How does +healing items work in conjunction with the following:
---
Seal of Light, Judgement (Seal of Light) for the attacker, Troll Blood Potions, Bloodthirst, and Lifesteal enchant?
---
I had a group of alliance attack my 60 mage while farming zf. I escaped back into the instance but my ice block and cold snap were on cooldown so aoe wasn't going to happen for awhile.  I zone out and their 60 had left.  I proceeded to spend the next half hour murdering sub-50s out of spite.
---
Does mob respawn rate change with the number of players in an area? I was killing farmers in hillsbrad, but they were respawning almost immediately after being killed. Made it near impossible to get into the houses and barns. I've also had it a few times in other zones where I've been killed by mobs I just killed. So frustrating to try and plan an encounter only to be thwarted because I'm trapped by instantly respawning mobs.
---
Alch may suck for making money leveling but the value of making your own  pots can't be overstated
---
Wow. That sounds horrible.
---
I did this on my warrior too right after my WW axe at lvl 32 and I'm lvl 40 now. In 8 levels I did nothing but killing ogres west of refugees point in arathi, raptors in northern duskwallow marsh and tigers+trolls in northern STV. I have skinning + mining and no cooking (too lazy there I guess). I started with 10g at lvl 32 and now have 58g at lvl 40. I'm planning on just grind mobs to lvl 60 and I don't know how long it's going to take. I don't think I care since I'm having too much fun.
---
As a pve or d spec combat rogue.... Zero.
---
Your best hope is that you have all your cooldowns up and that they are terrible. Free action potion will help a lot against mages but your dps is min-maxed for high sustained white damage... Basically garbage in PvP. You want controllable cc and burst - the exact opposite of what raid specs tune for.
---
The thing that was really pissing me off is that a single miss early in the encounter would throw off my whole rotation. I usually tried to save rage from my last encounter so when I charged in and popped SS, I could Demo Shout before switching to Zerker stance, hit Blood Rage (again if needed) and WW. I'd hit cleave if I had excess rage, then switch to Defensive stance to sunder/taunt as needed, hitting WW when I could if the cooldown was done. That one missed attack usually means I Blood rage early, and everything kind of falls apart from there.
---
Any advice for someone planning to go Fury dual wield?
---
Out of all the special elite gear like this that I have seen be made, it is always the Guild Leader or someone equivalent who ends up getting it every time.  And it winds up being the majority of the guild working together to get that person the weapon/gear/etc.  I guess they are the "leader" who formed it and is in charge, but I frequently get this thought of how in high school there was always 1 girl who sort of "ran" the group, making decisions for everyone, and expected everyone to do things for them.  I don't know why I feel that way, but I've seen it too many times to think it's a coincidence.
---
Horde on Thunderfury checking in. You guys missed me lol I just saw in chat you guys were there and noped on out. I got gold to farm for my mount I ain‚Äôt got time for dat
---
Downvote for OP not knowing how to use a hand-held pocketable screenshot device
---
Whom, Where, and Whatever.
---
I probably just don't play on them often enough. Where is my shaman that's like level 10.
---
"Anyone wanna kill this horde that's doing nothing wrong?"
---
Remember when the Forsaken of Lordaeron tried to mend forces with the alliance of stormwind and were rejected based on their xenophobic beliefs?
---
Damn dude. I‚Äôm a Druid tank, it‚Äôs dropped my first run and we literally didn‚Äôt even have anyone who could equip it. Mage just D/E‚Äôd it.
---
I'm a lvl 34 priest and I got obliterated by lvl 28 rogue yesterday. Haven't played proper PvP for YEARS so fighting this guy with all his cast-cancelling and fast movement was a pain in the ass.
---
I didn't even bother. I just purchased the pattern off the AH. It costs more gold, but saves a TON of time.
---
Great read thanks for the few minutes of entertainment haha
---
What did you farm? My warrior is lvl 24
---
followed and gonna listen to it. thanks
---
Ghey?
---
I also feel bad as hell ganking people. I hate it when people waste my time with it, I aint gonna do that shit to anyone else.   
---
Except for that dumb lvl 56 hunter killing lvl 50 horde players. That guy had the chance to walk away peacefully and still wanted more. Camped his sorry ass.
---
I only grinded from lvl36 to lvl40 had 20g after mount and training.
---
Bro you‚Äôre projecting a lot of what perceive people are like upon me without knowing literally anything about how I interact with others. I believe I am nothing but pleasant when I‚Äôve seen someone in a place I‚Äôm trying to grind. 
---
My only shit experience was on my Alliance Warrior when a Mage told me he was completing a quest (There is no quest) as he killed Crimson Whelps. Like... I just layered away, but that gnome was definitely a douche for taking the spot and lying. 
---
It‚Äôs not really about this ‚ÄúWoe is me, the warrior life is so hard‚Äù it‚Äôs just yeah it‚Äôs hard, please just be courteous to others.
---
Nothing but auto attacking mobs for 3 and a half days. I would go mad.
---
Running SM with a farmgroup wil net you 10-20G/H. Its also great way to push up to 40.
---
Feign death, freezing trap.
---
Backup, send pet, pew pew.
---
The results are highly dependend on what / where you grind tho. Harpies or turtles are a huge dif for example
---
If you have your PC running at home you could set up Chrome remote Desktop
---
Well I dunno if Warlocks are ever going to top DPS charts over a Rogue/Warrior especially if a shaman is in the group so that might be hard ask to do consistently. I think ~10% behind while managing threat to pure DPS classes is pretty decent.
---
One could turn it around and say if all ninja no one ninjas.
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôre dead right about that man. Stalagg was fucked up. 
---
As for it not being as bad, I‚Äôd disagree. Stalagg had layers at least. Heartseeker hasn‚Äôt had layers. And the population here is 80/20 as well. Seriously just pick any time any day and you can count the alliance and horde in any zone. You‚Äôll always come out with alliance having quadruple the number of people in the zone than horde do. And even before I started counting myself we had a guy on the Heartseeker discord who counted every person that was level 60 and made a graph. It was a legit 75% to 25% split for the 60s. 
---
Heartseeker is screwed just like Stalagg now. Horde are giving up trying to level and with transfers closed it isn‚Äôt gonna improve. Once paid transfers come the remaining horde are gonna peace out.
---
12 year olds played wow 15 years ago and they'll play it today. Glad to see the game hitting such a wide demographic again.
---
I always pick up Last Stand, def worth it in SO MANY situations
---
The immersion is real
---
Or the other group could have waited like 30 min, and the one guy came by stole it and didnt add any of them to party.
---
Uninstall Norton Security for starters.
---
Block WoWVoiceProxy.exe, I think is the name.
---
In my eyes, both of you seem like asses.  It's just haggling. No need to take offense. A simple No, thank you, 3.6g is my lowest would've been more than enough. I always try to lower the price, even if it's lower than AH already. Why wouldn't you like to save a bit more if you can? 2.75g is too low a counter offer, I agree, but no reason to act like an ass afterwards.
---
Ik, but i keep seeing people who would rather use hero strike or some other bs. Sunder is extremely good and should be pretty much spammed.
---
man you really hit the nail on the head here. i always got frustrated by this but never realised how much of a phenomenon it was on this game. a lot of the replies have already explained it and made a lot of sense, but i just wonder why this games community attracts more of these types. maybe it's because the same type of people that prefer to bury their heads in the sand so they can't hear things they don't want to also enjoy burying their head in wow to escape other things such as real life. i really noticed so many (for lack of a better term) weirdos on this game, who are completely socially inept, and seem to carve out their own little word in this game (because it's amazing and let's you do that), but then have no perspective outside of it and cry when you burst their bubble.
---
bit of a culture shock as someone who played consoles in the golden era of smack talk and has 1000s of hours in csgo and league of legends, where in the former at least people are always down to fight with you verbally until the end of time even over the smallest mistake. i guess more people in this community refer the flight response to arguments or confrontation.
---
1: Install spy
---
2: Use track hidden when stealth classes are around
---
3: Place a freezing trap at your feet before you pull
---
4: Don't use intimidate/bestial wrath when alliance are around
---
If you get them trapped/intimidate cheetah to get to range, put Hunter's Mark on them as you are getting range. Then aimed shot(multi if you don't have it yet) as you sic pet and conc/multi/serpent on the run.  Switch to monkey if they just imp sprint so they don't get you dazed.
---
Looks almost compulsive. Maybe he has Tourette's?
---
Grinding SM can get some good money.  Work on AHing your crafting materials instead of grinding them.
---
Don't buy your unimportant skills like thunderclap (aside from rank 1) or all three elements for mage (don't buy all frost rank ups if you are fire).
---
As horde, you can grind fishing traps off the coast of Desolace, Shadowprey Village.  Fishing poles will sell for 2-3g and you can get 55s for every 5 shellfish.  You can get around 10g an hour this way, depending on your ability to hold your breath, undead are great here.
---
I've made around 10g or so from small silk bags, selling for 40-50s each.  You can also just sell the silk or cloth drops on the AH as well, tailors are always hungry for cloth.
---
Speaking your mind and ignoring facts? People like that are presidents in real life.
---
Not really, it just means that it wasn't wanted by a dumbass.
---
"only" :D
---
Yeah, from these lines I can see you must be great to have around. 
---
Hmmmm, this might be a game, but you are putting in time, and according to OP there was an agreement before he joined (we have no evidence of this, but we also have no right to assume he/she is lying, so let's believe it's the truth). Those dudes are dicks and they make the experience worst for other players. It doesn't matter where you are, you can always be nice to one another, it enhances the experience for everyone involved. Of course you can choose to be an asshole, but don't complain when you face the consequences, ig or irl.
---
Cheers!
---
I have thought it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to post here too it‚Äôs getting attention all that matters
---
That‚Äôs a speedball

I know how easy she is, I find it funny that you had to come here and flex pserver experience though despite my post simply stating that fights will be different and it will be entertaining.

"LFM STRAT ORBS RESERVED PLATE SUCH AND SUCH RESERVED AND I HAVENT ASKED THE HEALER YET"
---
tbh if I needed to do Strat UD for another reason I wouldn't give af if the mount is reserved. Absurdly low drop chance. It's like your friend telling you if he ever wins the lottery he's not gunna give you any money. It's like ok ur not winning the lottery anyways lol lets go do the dungeon
---
If you have skinning I‚Äôd just grind out animals.  If you don‚Äôt have skinning then grind out humaniods.
---
You‚Äôll actually get some decent green gear.  I actually came across a pretty awesome boe blue that I‚Äôm still wearing.
---
Spellcleave
---
Snowball maybe a npc name they blocked most npc and lore names.
---
I can agree with this assessment.
---
Bigglesworth
---
Well your best route is to attempt to find a few friends while leveling. Unfortunately without a guild a lot of the content is going to be harder at level cap. So still being a part of a social friendly guild is still helpful, but if your that close you might opt to just avoid the quest and find another avenue to acquire experience.
---
Update it
---
That's why PVE servers exist
---
No one is saying they cant do that, we are just laughing at them for it.
---
The default loot rules is "need all BoEs". Because it maked ninja looting impossible and is ultimately the most fair since BoEs are worth the same to everyone. It also allows the winner to have people /roll again or gift to someone. 
---
If you want to go with "mainspec need BoEs, offspec greed" and open yourself up to ninjas, you need to state that at the beginning of the run so you can actually determine if someone's a ninja because they aren't following loot rules.
---
24-26 durnholde keep in hillsbrad (there is a hidden vendor in the area) 26-28 I went for the barrens beasts by the razorfen dungeons!
---
Venruki,Staysafe, and Cromm are great
---
You‚Äôre fighting bad rogues lol
---
Thank you for the responses figured that this was the case
---
Blizzard did confirm and say they were implementing dynamic respawn (more people = quicker mob respawn) in certain situations and zones.
---
According to the official post, the lower level zones have higher respawn rates. So, as you level up, you won't see as crazy respawn rates.
---
[Source:  Blizzard Post on August 8](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dynamic-respawns/245750/71)
---
I would assume so
---
I think its tied with legend of the black shawarma for my favorite, and im the supervisor is also pretty great
---
$$$$$ this guy gets it. Got me to 60 real fast. I will say, tanking for pug idiots wears you down, but you‚Äôll have dps and heal options to fall back on, and leveling as feral is way easier than leveling a warrior.
---
Commenting for same thing!
---
I don't get why it's obnoxious? (I have never made a group for a dungeon, reserved or unreserved.) 
---
You can just not join the group if you don't want those items reserved? Why is this an issue for you?
---
I truly don't know the answer, but as resto druid I've been seeing the same challenge.  I did leverage [wowclassicbis.com](https://wowclassicbis.com) to see what kind of endgame stats I should be looking at pre-raid.
---
For resto druids it's this:
---
* 511 +healing
---
* 9 mp5
---
* 30 int
---
* 85 spirit
---
So for my class, +healing is way better than more int.
---
But...you may be in a different spot, so maybe do a similar exercise for shaman endgame bis?
---
Now get Ironfoe
---
same
---
same.
---
kinda sad how many people are actually seriously bothered about this
---
&gt;if everyone in your group has a functioning brain.
---
That's a high bar to set there, friendo.
---
Ended too early
---
Yeah, but aren't many people running some logging software that uploads their runs on wow/warcraft logs and whatnot? I assume, I don't know, but I assume it may also include character names.
---
&gt;I will say this again (for the 10+ time). No matter how many times you do something, the chance of it happening is still 3%. Just like in roulette; if 500 blacks in a row came up, the next one is still only 50% chance of being red.
---
&gt;the next one is still only 50% chance of being red.
---
&gt;the next one
---
You‚Äôre still talking about an individual drop chance. I‚Äôm saying that, overall. At the root of this discussion, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs more than a 3% likelihood that a guild would get Sulfuras, so it‚Äôs not that impossible. The likelihood that they got the drop is *more than 3%*. 
---
I feel like I‚Äôm being trolled though so ima hang up.
---
i felt a little bad the other night when i ganked a warlock on my feral druid.   he had just finished eating/drinking and was at full health/mana again, but was still sitting down so i knew my ravage would crit.
---
ravage: 600 crit
---
shred: lucky 400 crit.
---
dead warlock.
---
he couldn't even react.
---
No mechanisms for collections.
---
Weapons can be Main-Hand, Off-Hand and One-Hand. And early on until you specialize through talents i would say a slow weapon is the best Main-Hand, and a fast weapon the best off-hand. No matter type
---
All abilities scale of the damage value on your Main-hand, not the DPS value.
---
Off-hand deal 50% damage, And with talent Rogue takes this up to 75%.
---
Just msg me if you want to know anything else. GL!
---
Cmon man, some of us find it funny. Its a perfect example of confirmation bias.
---
New day, new bot, same spot! seems the Vul'gol ogre mound in duskwood is very popular, check your server!
---
the thex thing is sorta a meme here haha
---
Yeah if you already have curse of agony applied for example and they start running you can apply recklessness and they'll run back to whoever has aggro. It can also be important to use rank 1 of the ability on melee mobs as it increases their attack power.
---
Time to reroll. We will not stand for this abuse anymore!
---
im not doing the quest for experience. it rewards the best in slot ring for my class
---
Some words are hard... lmao
---
While I do see where you are coming from, there are still some pretty decent talents within the Frost tree that directly correlate to an increase of damage, that you just can't get to with only 20 points spent into it.
---
He's incorrect though
---
Yep, the stereotypes are very real. UD rogues and mages are KOS, for the horde it's gnome mages that are KOS
---
google "oh bother". Then google "engage". This isn't a discussion.
---
I've never noticed that, when you mc does it make you target whoever your mc victim was targeting? I have mouseover macros on my buffs and I don't think I ever had a problem with this, maybe u gotta retarget once u gain control of them.

Auto attacking a large portion of your damage.

iirc if you use an ability right as you're about to swing then you use that swing for your ability and you don't get your swing. So if you just make sure your ability is just before or just after the swing you shouldn't negate it.

If I'm wrong, I welcome correction as long as it's backed with evidence

I put fiery on mine and it lasted until 44. Does decent damage and relatively cheap on my server.

If I walked up to you and told you the same joke 27 times in the span of one day, would you laugh or get annoyed by the end of it?
---
That's literally what this subreddit is doing.
---
I don't think you have really helped much when you leave the name of the guild in. You are doing your best to work around rule 3 and still have your witch hunt.
---
If that's your problem I don't think fifty extra mana from a blue chest is a viable solution.
---
Ret paladin so luckily I can skip that struggle
---
Haha sorry it went over my head. Kind of new to the wow subreddit.
---
Honestly if someone's ignoring you and it was for a stupid reason, you won't have to group with them ever again, so think of it as a win. 
---
The shitty shit, is them still messaging you after ignoring you.
---
That's shit.
---
What unit frames are those?  I need them.
---
Yeah the recipes aren't worth jack shit, but just for the drops off the boss and stuff. Pyro has a wand and staff on his drop table, vendors well, he adds like 2-3g to each run.
---
MC is really easy.  My guild just did 6/8 MC with half the raid being pugs and a handful of people not even 60.  Lots of fresh 60's too with low level gear and many people who have never done MC before.
---
Only reason we stopped was bc we didnt have enough people who could douse the flames.
---
But I NEEDED Alterac Swiss for my cooking quest WTH.
---
Oh ok thanks. I wasn‚Äôt rly aware of the damage reduction in off hand weapons
---
Yeah that's fine, you can play like that, but if you've not made any friends along the way while doing that you're not gonna have anyone at 60 who wants to help you out. That's what guilds are good for - people help each other out. It's that or sit in LFG all day putting together a Darrowshire group, you will manage eventually.

Going to be leveling up an alt soon with a buddy who is leveling a Hunter. What has the best synergy with a Hunter? Particularly for 2V2 when it releases.

After all that you haven't understood a word. Dense as a rock, jfc LOL.
---
You're part of the problem
---
[I believe this is the source](https://i.redd.it/gc6bq2v83sq31.png)
---
no, since mobs are way lower level i didn't pull them, to get into the vault i used one potion of invi tho.
---
BTW, if you get reported for your name, you can just choose the same name again, unless they fixed it recently. Just in case you know ... you really want to stick it to him :)
---
I‚Äôm in the same position as you right now and I‚Äôm also on Incendius.
---
I convinced some irl friends who played with me back in the day to come play classic. But none of them are playing nearly as much as myself. So I have found myself alone at 60 for a few weeks now.
---
I joined a guild to raid with but it ended up collapsing due to drama. Went in an out of a few different guilds and spent some time leveling an alt, farming gold, working on professions. I‚Äôve found a new guild since then and have started raiding. So fingers crossed this one is a keeper.
---
My best advice is to join the server discord and scroll through the guild recruitment/pugs channel. You can even put out a post for looking for guild. Find something you think you will like and jump in. Keep an open mind and try to be social. Just continue doing pugs with people and I‚Äôm sure you will find some people you like. That‚Äôs how I found my current guild. 
---
Feel free to dm me if you want to chat. My current guild is quite large. It‚Äôs social but has 3 raid teams right now. So lots going on and lots of people to do dungeons/chat with.
---
pve servers are alrdy dead
---
Always welcome! :D
---
And yes it is purely bankalts, the highest we have is around level 20 and he basically have to prove it that hes a bank alt!
---
I guess its a difference of perspective. I expect everyone to do the shitty thing the moment they get the chance. Sadly I don't get proven wrong. 
---
You are right I don't have proof, only blizzard does, but I can take the parts of the issue and make a pretty good guess of what's going on.
---
Just whisper someone else in the guild saying you want to apply and ask who the GM is.
---
This is definitely the case, years of retail created the expectation that you always need to be in the most optimal spec for the job. Fact is a warrior can tank any sub-40 instance in the same str/sta gear he‚Äôs using out on the map, sometimes not even needing to switch to 1h/shield. It‚Äôs a similar story with Druids and to an smaller extent Paladins(they‚Äôre the first class to need a separate tanking set and points into prot as early as SM).
---
In my experience if one person is attempting to fight an obviously losing battle - i‚Äôd guess they are relatively new to the game..
---
I‚Äôve been running into these players left right and centre and feel so bad I just help out as much as I can. Saw an underleveled solo Paladin start the chicken escort in Feralas - after considering my options I chose to help her out with the Q. 
---
I figured if she started it solo chances are they didn‚Äôt really know what was coming (3-5 at a time a few times throughout)
---
I was 2h arms with Beastslayer this ~42dps shitty axe from Ungoro until 58. I swapped to fury with Thrash Blade and a ~35dps OH sword and saw a huge improvement in kill times.
---
Worth it if your 2hander REALLY sucks. But you won't be able to kill 2 at once without sweeping strikes
---
Pretty sure the modern WoW client could detect speed hacking. Pretty sure its bad lag but it looks really bad
---
I also just hit 35! Levelling in the 30's in Desolace and Scarlet Monastery has been a blast so far.
---
hello! you can download my addons from my discord: [https://discord.gg/wVSpShW](https://discord.gg/wVSpShW)
---
For enchants in general, the prices usually don't decrease that much because people keep getting new weapons during all the content. There is a constant demand. For example, righteous orbs are always valuable because it's the best weapon enchant for warriors, and they get new weapons in every phase.
---
Well yeah excepting the fact that I don't think anyone looks cool in an argument in fucking World of Warcraft of all things.
---
I had a similar problem as a hunter in LBRS. I just wanted to tame a wolf for the howl, I had to tell tanks I didn't want the crosbow.
---
Stance swaps and abilities have separate gcds, meaning you can press them simultaneously.
---
That's faster than pushing the same button twice.
---
Yo, i just did that one! Its so great that the spawn table only has like 7 shamans in the entire ogre area, 4 of which are in 1 spot and the other 3 are scattered to hell and back. And then ou get to go back and kill ogre-mages! I just want to kill everthing and bring all the bodies back on a giant Forsaken Meat Wagon and be done.
---
Assuming you followed your add-on's advice and immediately disenchanted it, right?
---
Its for the "extra attack" from sword spec in combat.
---
The extra attack really just resets your auto attack timer but can proc off of all attacks.
---
So you want to wait until you auto to use special attacks in case your proc a swing timer reset.
---
But if you want just unit frames that look extremely similar, **Shadowed Unit Frames** is an addon that can do what you want. Highly configurable.
---
Yeah for a lot of guilds this is a precarious situation.
---
Some things I've done for my own guild:
---
* Guild PvP events and go gank an area or raid a town
---
* Goofy guild fishing trip
---
* Internal duels (organized or not) at Gurbubashi arena
---
Just make sure that everyone knows they are invited and make sure to go out of your way to tell people to protect your lowbies if you all end up in a higher level zone :)
---
On the other hand, if you aggro three mobs and I jump in to help so you don't die, don't run away and leave me to die.
---
Your clones are very impressive, you must be very proud.
---
That or https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Opl77bP7vbY
---
Mom can we get a [Sulfuras hand of ragnaros]? 
---
At home:
---
Scholo is a great place to farm AD rep and although only one player in party needs a key, it doesn't hurt to get one yourself.
---
BRD is huge and there's a lot of popular routes. Full runs are usually advertised as such, and can take like 3 hours to complete. Once you got your shadowforge key and don't need anything from interrogator (since you probably farmed that area in your low 50s), there's little reason to do the "lower" side anymore.
---
Disappointed in you. All gnomes are KOS. You should know this, it's part of the Horde handbook
---
There‚Äôs also a bunch of tweets. 
---
‚ÄúWell it doesn't matter what it was meant to be. All I am saying is that this is nothing, absolutely nothing like original Vanilla. This is 2 years after Vanilla. or even 2.5 years later if you count the 6 months US had on EU.‚Äù
---
I wasted at least 8 quail while figuring out a macro. So dumb of me
---
Still happens sometimes
---
But they did the math! For a video game! Fuck people just dicking around for fun!
---
Great guy, that is the spirit ! I am glad that the community is mostly friendly and helpfull on Classic.
---
BTW I love his nickname ! (It's not me though)
---
Kinda how horde dont have a FP in WPL.  Have to run from hillsbrad or undercity.
---
But it basically makes for infinite mana on a holy paladin
---
Check out the macro I posted above. Free up some action bar space!
---
3. He is one of the Bowery King‚Äôs assassins.
---
That makes a lot of sense, thank you for explaining that. My first character is a troll mage, so this is especially applicable!
---
Find a new discord server then
---
The item is useful for anyone IMHO. It is quite logical to need it if you have nothing in the shoulder slot.
---
That looks like lag. Really really bad lag.
---
if you get aggro do. not. run. away. from. the. tank. 
---
you risk pulling more packs you might have skipped, run in to patrolls, and be annoying for the tank. Instead, run to the tank, freeze it, iceblock. Even just stand still and do nothing untill the tank gets aggro back is better than spazzing out.
---
Me and other player rolled 94, I won the role lol.
---
Why are you SV spec while leveling?
---
Heartseeker is high pop alliance friendly
---
ITS CLOTH!!! You know about the different armor types, right? This will almost do nothing for you, you ninjas this out of ignorance apparently
---
I can run it fine on a T430 with integrated intel graphics.
---
Where are you from? I only ask because I live in the states and my experience is that most people would have said or typed "halfway done with a quest" whereas you said "halfway done a quest" which I have only ever heard from people in Delaware or Maryland, USA. Just curious haha

This is why I didn't respec from deep feral until I had my pre raid resto set, I still haven't respecced cause the sex parties are too wild to give up
---
Yeah basically give him a few seconds to get aggro on everything.
---
Maybe there weren‚Äôt any or they already had it themselves?
---
You aren't wrong, but there is currently a very important bug with Heroic Strike that was never fixed in retail (they just got rid of the spell instead)

He probably needed on a nearly useless item and got accused of being a ninja.
---
Just RMB become turn, no combination needed, you turn so smoothly with the mouse
---
Skinning is fine if you can do devilsaurs, but on most servers that's probably not likely.  It's also fine while lvling, because it does not slow you down too much and is good supplemental income.  But mining and herbs will last longer, and make more consistent income, especially as more people get raiding.
---
Yea I figured I‚Äôd have to do some greyed out quests to get the chains going was just hoping to avoid that if possible but had to do that in stonetalon as well. I seem to be out leveling some quest areas before I get to them which is weird because I haven‚Äôt really ran many dungeons (did 2 so far) and haven‚Äôt really ground many mobs.
---
Well, that and Gnomer is a pain in the butt.  I'm only going there if I'm a druid and need to restock my weapon supply
---
I totally get reserving 1-2 (maybe more) if you're a TANK and that is your only motivation to do the run, as tanks are really the limiting factor to dungeon running, and there is nearly 0 tank gear in strat, but this was a DPS lol.

---
Further: you should fish all the pools in the area to increase wreckage spawns. If you only fish wreckage pretty soon there will be none.
---
But that first one will always look the most badass.
---
I mean, it might look good lore-wise, but if you give all of Kalimdor to the Horde and all of NR to the Alliance, you're basically destroying all natural interactions between factions.
---
I far prefer questing as well, but that was hardly a valid option for me on Mograine. Questing was blatantly impossible from about 35+ onward unless you were playing in the early morning.
---
And well, the leveling thing is one thing, but since hitting 60 I've frequently made like 60-100g from a single night of dungeons. It just feels really strange considering the perpetual poverty I was in in actual vanilla. I couldn't imagine ever buying an epic mount if not for hitting R11 back then.
---
Thankfully as a mage this takes a little less time :)
---
If you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about why reply. 
---
Each number is selected randomly and independently, the number before and after does not affect the next number selected. Getting 1,2,3,4,5 has the exact same odds as getting 23,45,2,78,12
---
Ah makes sense. I'm filthy casual and started using addons for the first time, but thanks for the clarification!
---
How does 4hp5 do nothing? You wrote that comment out of nothing apparently
---
Hit 50 on my paladin last night. The grind to 60 is going to be rough.
---
Yep, just like lotto numbers
---
Had similar experience, except alliance guy wanted the mobs and I wanted the rare spawn. Couldn't pull one with out the other 2-3 mobs, so we team worked it out.
---
Makes sense since I just started using addons and this is one of them. Thanks!
---
Depends on the server I think, Mankirk on Horde side is kinda hit or miss for mages. Leveling it seemed like mages were a dime a dozen, but into the 50's plus I see less and less. I know a few guilds that were recruiting mages and rogues exclusively since there seems to be a shortage. Seems to me like everyone rolled mage to start but it seems like most either quit or re-rolled due to the meta being old. 
---
Warriors on the other hand are plentiful (to the point where most groups have 2 warriors, as well as priests.
---
Did you ever stop to think that maybe it isn't lazy but a masterplan? Because we have all seen the mad rage it sends ppl into on this sub.
---
Any screenshot I plan to post on here will 100% be from my phone camera for that reason üòä XoXoX
---
The mages I play with always pull mobs through my consecration so I get aggro, it's convenient for everyone
---
But that requires the warlock to find 2 other people to help summon..
---
...?
---
Not the bad guy, that mage is a loser. Empty slot,  the armor and hp5 is an upgrade for you as well at that point of time. 
---
The mage needs to grow up if he‚Äôs really posting about that being ninja looting. It‚Äôs not like you need rolled shoulders with int and spell dmg on them
---
r/titlegore
---
I'd be frustrated with a prot warrior.  WHAT TF ARE YOU DOING MY MAN!
---
Mom: But you already have a [Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker] at home!
---
Imo just always be willing to pay and whenever you message them say: "Can I pay you for some water?". It's not expensive. Just do like 25s-50s or if you think that's too much you can ask them how much do they charge. Again, important to ask in that way because it communicates your willingness to pay with no ambiguity.
---
That dude may have been an asshole but he was right about the price being too high. But it pays off to play on a shitty server I guess. People buy the weirdest stuft.
---
Ignore him he's a dipshit
---
Yeah but not til a later phase. You will likely be 60 by then
---
look it up big guy
---
Now that I agree with.  But that ties into the 1.12 itemization and raid changes into that window of WoW.  We are seeing the game as it was post Naxx release without the Naxx and AQ instances, inevitable then that content gets steamrolled from before that time.
---
Not yet.  It's going to be a few months for bgs
---
I would pick Classic if you‚Äôre more concerned with a community focused game. I hardly ever grouped up with people when I played OSRS but am constantly working together and playing with random people every day in Classic. Both OSRS and Classic are time sink grinds, but OSRS is much more time consuming in my opinion. Classic is more engaging as well, where in OSRS you are typically able to do other things while you grind. Due to the point and click nature of OSRS it can get very boring at times (at least to me).
---
I‚Äôve gone back and forth with both of these games for the last 10 or so years, and have enjoyed them both at different times. I‚Äôd suggest Classic right now because it‚Äôs very alive and the community is amazing for the most part. Don‚Äôt let the fact that you are new to the game dissuade you from trying it. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to try out WoW, Classic is where you want to start. I‚Äôd suggest watching a few videos from Madseasonshow on YouTube to get started.
---
42 is halfway for time played and 47 is halfway as far as total required xp.
---
It‚Äôs cloth..... a rogue uses LEATHER, can I need for leather when I‚Äôm a level 60 hunter?
---
she‚Äôs cute :]
---
Low levels arent gonna have a fun time running through searing gorge.
---
Bring an offtank (warrior/feral/paladin DPS with a shield). Mechanic solved.
---
I use Mouseover macros on quite a few abilities. Targeting someone who's low health and struggling with a mob, but casting at the mob they are killing is always fun. I've had a few people stand there and just /golfclap or sigh, even  had one person alt f4.... All because they think I was going to kill them. Most of them /thank me after too once the confusion has worn off. A rogue chased me for about a minute just to thank me for saving him last night in stv instead of ganking.
---
Then in the next breath I'll heartlessly gank someone because they're killing mobs I need and the drop chance is low enough already.
---
Putting your mains on the opposing faction to send the executioner to collect on unpaid debts would be pretty fun.
---
Again, not profitable, but I would bet my boots there are people who would spend their time doing this level of RP.
---
How does a bank alt work? I started WoW in Legion so all this Classic stuff is new to me. Do you just have them next to a capital city bank and send stuff to them?
---
The reason they're yelling is because classic leveling is a lot different and gear lasts a long time. People saying leveling gear doesn't matter are just indifferent to caring about it. It is often expected you will be rolling for gear in the spec you are playing unless you indicate otherwise. The cloth robe was great caster loot and because you have three armor loot tables to loot from and a cloth caster only has one loot table to loot from they should get first rolls on the robe.
---
Your white hits can still glance, regardless of this bug. Even if you are cancelling HS perfectly, your main hand can still glance.
---
Wailing caverns is basically a massive empty cave with boring mob types, no really good loot drops for it's level range, horrible XP gain, and little actual story behind the whole thing. It's questionable why it was even included as an instance, especially at such a low level and basically not tied to the rest of Azeroth in any meaningful fashion.
---
BRD on the other hand is chock full of different types of encounters, exciting themes and interesting details, great XP and loot for endgame content, and it is full of backstory that is woven in to the lore. There is so much to explore and learn about it that it is difficult for it to really get full unless you're mindlessly grinding BiS gear in it.
---
Even though the two are very long dungeons, they are not comparable at all. WC is a complete mess and not worth consideration at all. BRD is an absolute must and will be core to your vanilla experience.
---
Except that one time I grouped with someone in Feralas to kill the ogres in the south. It was over crowded so good to have a group. There's a parallel quest to find an orb off one of the ogre shadow mages, but only 1 person can get it. We spent almost an hour killing these mages before I had to go. I logged back on an hour later and he was still at it and I helped for another half hour or so that I didn't have cause I really wanted him to get it, I felt bad leaving
---
They will be, not currently in though. I think in phase 3 we'll get Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley.
---
When talking about "being high enough to solo", I'd argue most people think about dire maul before deadmines.
---
Do you not know of the leather shoulder pads you can get at level 22? And how this was a ninja?
---
Level 60 hunters don't wear all mail. Literally half Hunter prebis is leather. Do some research.
---
Thanks for this find man
---
I think those whelps are around level 38... not sure why it was suggested for level 27

---
You should prob stick with retail.
---
Now you're just arguing semantics. Do you have a better, succinct way to characterize it than a screenshot with greater resolution than the monitor?
---
Harpy cave in thousand needles was EXCELLENT from 28-32. The respawn time is low and the density is high. Only works if you can deal with two mobs at the same time sometimes.
---
I guess it depends on how you're spec'd. I don't do very much dmg with a cheap shot, but I get 1 CP closer to my eviscerate. With how few opportunities I'm going to get to generate a CP while being kited, I'd like to get to 5 as soon as I can.
---
For 1 gold?  This is funny
---
Just hit 55 and I refuse to pay $375-425gold for devilsuar set for just 2% hit for a pre raid bis...
---
And that is when you report them.
---
As a priest, I also never go on PUG UBRS runs because I inevitably end up solo healing the entire raid as they continuously pull when I have no mana and make comments when they die. Then, when something good for me drops, I end up rolling verses half the raid on the few things I'd want. Last night I lost a roll on Briarwood reed to our druid tank because he's "about to respec restoration for MC." 
---
The few pug runs I've been on have ended up costing me more than I made due to repair costs amd drinks. I die more since people don't cc anymore they just run in and start hitting whatever so agro bounces everywhere including on me and no one bothers to get shit off of me. As far as drinks, the last two runs I've been on have had no mage. Since the current meta involves going through everything at a break neck pace with tons of melee DPS, I don't think I got more than 2 sips of drink between pulls. I ran through close to 60 money glory dew at 40s per 5.
---
Smokes!
---
Took a guildie warrior 230 runs to get his. Im on that painweaver grind myself. It's just brutal when you're grinding for small upgrades.

At lvl 38 I walked thru on the path without aggroing a single mob

Didn‚Äôt you see this is precisely how you remember the game from 15 years ago?

It is 6% for 63 lvl mobs if you have 305 weaponskill (orc with axes or human with maces/swords).
---
What bosses have armor after faerie fire, sunder armor, curse of recklessness and annihilator?  Excuse my ignorance, since I thought after these four debuffs that bosses would be at 0, and some bosses do not even need the complement of the druids or annihilator.
---
Why? Maybe they're friends but not guilded.
---
If you don't like what they're offering, don't join. It's pretty much the same thing as requesting a specific class to fill the last slot of a party without being explicit about why.

It makes sense to have a diverse group to reduce gear competition as much as possible.
---

---
Yeah I‚Äôve always loved people in car sales who are like my manager always fucks up my deals they always miss something and it‚Äôs their fault. 
---
And I would be like, that‚Äôs strange man my deals are never all fucked up. Who‚Äôs the common denominator? Oh the person complaining. 
---
They never seem to get far. Even when it‚Äôs the same person fucking up in raid mechanics, I‚Äôll still even take some blame. I have to decide to stay grouped with them or I‚Äôm the one not explaining it properly for their chestnut brain to understand.
---
wasnt telling you what to do only that youre no better than those who you claim are bad, if the tank did a shitty thing ok fine but so did you and it triggered you enough to global blist then cry about it here unsderstand what i mean?
---
So you don‚Äôt enjoy actually doing well in the game? I guess if you‚Äôre a paladin I can see why.
---
Repent, Harlqeuin!

Yes no one forced me to join . However when half the player base wants to make such groups and ii dont wanna join such groups  then i have much less players to play with . So it also affects me .

Yep, but I'm just surprised there aren't actual spam accounts. It seems lucrative enough to warrant spending $50-100/day on disposable gold spam accounts for operations running at scale.

Sorry garbage players don't get to take BiS items because they are impatient and short sighted. Anyone not terrible at this game wouldn't even think about it
---
A friend of mine had a name, Fangboner, reported in retail - she was able to send proof to Blizzard that this was a family surname in her lineage and they reversed the name change.  So there's some recourse for getting these things turned around if that wackjob does get enough people to report you.
---
I like to add healers who heal me at 85% instead of 55% with mana efficient heals, and wand or hit stuff when they aren't healing instead of standing there.
---
Also am more likely to ask for another run if the cloth dps knows when to stop casting and start wanding, so they don't have to drink as much. Warlocks when they life tap to a point and then eat and drink to be faster

---
The set is only about 200-225g on Westfall server. Which are you on?
---
I believe, without looking at your character sheet that warriors embrace is better.  
---
Leggins of the Ursa I think are better. 
---
The armor contribution will be relative to your current armor rating but shouldn‚Äôt be neglected. Armor/def are bread and butter mitigation against crushing blows and damage that you will be guaranteed to take. 
---
I prioritize: 
---
Defense to cap 
---
Armor
---
Hit
---
Parry 
---
Dodge
---
Str 
---
Crit
---
Again your priorities may be slightly different relative to your gear set. Armor up to cap is more valuable than anything else(If you‚Äôre at def cap). The armor cap is somewhere around 17.2k and with raid buffs will put you around the 21k mark to cap against 63 raid bosses or w/e.
---
My Hunter was Cumfarts until level 17.
---
People who talk about not changing ANYTHING are just being reactionary.  No one ACTUALLY only enjoyed the game because Paladins couldn't tank raids.
---
in 15 levels or so the warrior becomes very sensitive to you having an up-to-date weapon, and choosing mobs that are relatively low level or not overpulling to keep the kill times down.
---
The priest, once you get the spirit talents can go on for days. Once I got a couple of spirit blues from some dungeons I was able to solo elites for quests when I needed to. Set up dots, wand for a while while mana regens, heal self, then repeat. Ridiculously easy.
---
All the joy to them. üëå That's the shining beauty of it all.

Pepsi Co identifies it as a violation of their Mountain Dew trademark.  They roll through each wow server periodically to flag everyone with Dew in their name.  It's definitely nothing to do with feminine hygiene.
---
Diana's isn't.
---
You're right.  It comes with BWL.
---
Can confirm. Was present in the raid, determined he was the only one who was able to fund it, because he was the only one with guild bank access?
---
Some circular ninja looter logic. Would have loved to see it given to Bigtotem, as that‚Äôs the best use of that item.
---
Please note this is a notable and famous item, so it‚Äôs getting publicity but they change loot rules every raid and it becomes more and more ambiguous when you‚Äôre eligible for loot. Nearly everything is reserved for ‚Äúraiders‚Äù and that doesn‚Äôt necessarily constitute guild members. There are only a handful of people with that rank, and they are just friends of the guild leader.
---
So it‚Äôs a nice set up for them to profit off of others.
---
2 bis items on most list are lionheart helm and ring from mara. That 3% right there
---
Start mining bro
---
Had no idea about the paladin trainer in Dustwallow. Neat!
---
Whats the name of the addon?
---
I like this set up. The only piece I'm concerned about at a glance is those boots, don't they require mc trash drops?
---
You‚Äôre too low for badlands
---
I'm a disc priest but have 5 points in spirit tap, I try to get a mind blast off on low hp mobs in dungeons between heals to proc it. Sometimes my wand does the trick too! I'd definitely say it's not terrible in dungeons just a little less useful
---
Do I have to fill in the name of the weapon I want to use with your macros, or does the system just pull out a shield or weapon from your inventory based on the description in the macro?
---
Currently I manually go in to my macros and fill in the name of the weapon, every time I get a new one.
---
Where do you think they're getting the gold to sell us?
---
No, no.  Blizzard said Paladins would be fixed in the next patch.  It will be worth the wait!
---
*There are no balance patches or class changes for WoW classic.*
---
Oh...
---
I definitely killed the fuck out of an alliance warrior that charged in and attacked the mobs we were fighting, thinking he charged my friend.... I never got to apologize for nuking the poor chap
---
Didn't say I bought any. Said I saw what prices were.
---
How I feel sending in my raid application to a Rogue GM with my 21/3/27 build.
---
If they werent reserving items, they would just exclude entire classes. Reserving items is more inclusive and saves everyone time
---
Not sure why I didn't think of doing the shellfish while I just watch TV, and I have a backlog of stuff I want to watch. I think that's what I'll be doing tonight, thanks!
---
He, today I managed to get on Ignore for telling someone "Kazzak Griefing is a banable offense." (Not refering to the dragging him into Stormwind, but suciding characters into him to ruin a guilds kill attempt)
---
The end result of the roll does not affect the chances of it happening, you can literally google it
---
I don't cry about it. Did you see a post about that? I don't. Do I claim that I am better than others? No. Again, I don't see that. But yes, you are a random guy on reddit, with a sex name, I sure have to believe in all you say. OH SORRY MY DEAR GOD DEEPCUMINHERASS.   
---
I share my experience about ignoring someone.   
---
If you can't take that, I can only assume it was you, that failed and left.
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
Dis your lint!!
---
Im a magetard myself but if you think ‚Äùdoing well in the game‚Äù means popping off on dmgmeters then thats kinda weird. I‚Äôd rather take the good dude with spatial raid-awarness over the sweaty damagepumper. But whatever floats your boat man, just dont dismiss other people for having fun in a different way you do
---
There was no enhance shaman in that MC run though...
---
Yeah, warrior pretty much sucks at wPvP until 60 where your scaling really kicks in.  You can get pretty kitted though at various levels through dungeon gear.  It's a pain until 40 at a minimum.
---
Did ya make it?
---
I could go either way. I think you're reading into it a certain way that isn't necessarily the reality of the situation.
---
For example, the "come heal BRD" isn't necessarily a command as much as an attempt to persuade. Like if I messaged a friend and said "Come eat with us." Sure, you can argue you're not their friend on your side, but some people are just familiar with everyone pretty quickly.
---
At the very least, I wouldn't let those messages dissuade me from joining in. I'd rather judge the people from more interaction than a single line of text. You could hear those messages in actual voice and it sound a multitude of different ways, some of them rude and some of them perfectly acceptable.
---
Honestly, I'm at the point where the ring just isn't that much of an upgrade to stress about. Magni' s will is only a tiny bit lower. Nothing like no other sp trinket option or by far the best mh/oh combo till raiding.
---
That‚Äôs pretty funny. Petty revenge
---
[I mean it's not like there's a ton of options](https://i.imgur.com/9PYQ5Gw.jpg), it's pretty basic settings wise. You can toggle the border on/off but can't change the texture, and the default border looks bad. I'll try reinstalling, maybe I have an outdated version. Thanks though.
---
I don‚Äôt think people can read well
---
Thank saved this for when in finally there
---
Too true.  On this note it really isnt that big of a deal not to have your mount at 40.  Its more of an emotional thing and a minor convenience to have it at 40 rather than 42 or 43.
---
If you're not going to have the gold by level 40, then the time spent grinding in your 30s doesnt account for the time saved by being to mount up.
---
I mean, I'm definitely making sure I have enough by 40 even though it's slower overall.  I have nearly 4 days played at level 35 from all the dicking around I've been doing.
---
Sure, but he's really doing nothing wrong here. Reserving the item whilst offering payment for it is pretty fair imo
---
I needed to wake up to that
---
Lol. I find it funny how all these first time wow players appear all of the sudden already at level 60 with epic mounts and what not..
---
Nothing wrong, never said that. Some people like playing ret-palas on the expense of dps, whats wrong with that?
---
I tried to help an undead rogue kill the elites in the towers in the western plague lands, I took the agro and let him dps while I used evade. The elite swapped agro to him and two shot him so I vanished. I don't even think he had to kill the mob so I essentially got him killed and his armour took damage too. 
---
I am inadvertently a horrible person.
---
You honestly could have spared one more level of skills to tip the guy 3g. I‚Äôm not saying you should have. I am saying that your excuses are lame and statement in the pic was unnecessary and hollow. 
---
To me, it appears that you were given an extraordinarily rare/unexpected gift through an act of selflessness and felt compelled to reciprocate. However, it seems just after that initial surge of nobility you were pricked in the ass by self-preservation and needed to justify to this Samaritan by feeding him information that would make it appear as though you lacked the resources for the aforementioned reciprocation.  
---
I think if you imagine how he might feel stumbling across your post, you‚Äôd appreciate the essence of what people are saying about the perception of greed.
---
Downvote to keep this all a secret, but upvote because I never knew helpful pandas sounded so cute and calm when speaking English
---
They don't want logic or context, just blood
---
I did but fell off anyway in the heat of the moment
---
All bad names
---
But, getting money *is* part of character building. If I'm saving up for my epic mount why would I hand over for free a pattern worth a hundred gold or more? I mean by all means discuss within the group, I've even done things like okay if you want to buy the pattern from me I'll sell it at 50% cost but this "give it to them because they can use it" in a random pug group? Ehhhh
---
Some people are able to communicate and bypass the language barriers. In Tanaris, some Ally yelled out how we were Korean or something. Can‚Äôt remember the exact phrase, but it was odd, unexpected, and funny.
---
Garrote DoT breaks Blind though, so it can be a good idea to open with Cheap Shot even if you know that they'll blink it anyway. Lets you close in, force nova or some other cooldown, then Blind, restealth, etc.
---
Something similar happened to me. I gave someone 25g to be able to buy their mount, and he payed it back a few days later with interest. I love classic.
---
They got a lot of things wrong. Players are constantly discovering things that are wrong or plain broken with Classic. If they can't even get buffs right it makes me wonder what else have they gotten wrong that we've yet to discover.
---
Another point to consider: 
---
Players on smaller realms or more casual realms might have a weaker economy supporting their gear options and a weaker raiding infrastructure, causing them to be undergeared compared to players on the hardcore realms.
---
I know I specifically avoided some of the bigger realms in order to not play with the super-hardcore crowd. I'm a relatively casual player and I'd like to compete mostly with other casual players.
---
Sometimes, we nod to enemy. Sometimes - it is returned.
---
Yeah, they just want to be assholes and be "right", even when they're idiots and wrong. They're also completely unable to face even the slightest bit of criticism, hence the childish ignoring immediately after saying something shitty. 
---
Don't get me wrong, if someone is being a dick to you or is harassing you, block them by all means. But being a dick, then ignoring someone, then being a dick, etc., is such an immature thing to do.
---
You might want to try actual Fight Club for something less toxic.
---
It's due to the combo of all the stats- high armor for the bear multiplier, stam and def all together is just everything you want as a bear other than +hit to make sure you get to 8%
---
Yes, I believe conjured mage food is considered bread, so any pet that can eat bread as one of their listed food choices, it'll take. Great way to save gold if you have a mage friend.
---
This was a compelling read haha
---
Love the setup! What monitor arm is that?
---
Yes, if they can eat bread (like boars)
---
My experience so far is that this is because there's already two rogues in the group. Seems like they want to do Strat more than anyone.
---
Yes there was.
---
‚ÄùGet carried through the raid by others‚Äù what do you mean by that really? Healers get carried? Are you supposed to solo raid content and others are there merely to carry? What is teamwork?
---
What even is this absolute trash of a comment I just read jesus christ, its bad even by /r/classicwow standards
---
I plead the 5th...
---
It's a Vulcan thing
---
First Hunter player.
---
I'm having trouble teaching my Owl Screech and I think I must be doing something wrong. After catching my Owl I also caught a Greater Fleshripper. The entire weekend I used the Greater Fleshripper active and made sure Screech was the only ability it would use. After hours of playing I still can't teach my owl Screech. Am I doing something wrong?
---
arcane power frost is specifically for those bosses you are doing more dmg on, its the spec for sustained boss fight dps and nothing else. I'm assuming any mage outpacing you in DPS actually has better gear OR has 5/5 shatter still from ST leveling, which means more crits on trash that can be frozen, and thus more dps.
---
Also, you do have imp frostbolt 5/5, right?
---
How did you decide where to grind?  I'm thinking of grinding my alt up using the rested xp heavily...but I want to maximize xp and drops.
---
I often wonder if it's intentional that the (female) night elf crafting looks just like when you're crumbling down a bud of weed.
---
They are the same, use google
---
Paladin leveling is rough. You have heals so you can fight higher level stuff and solo elite quests and such but your Mana is always an issue. And AoE farming? Maybe way later with prot? I didn't know that was a known "good thing" haha
---
It's not really amazing or anything. It gets replaced in P3 with Drakefang talisman. It's just there's only 2-3 viable raiding trinkets for melee in p1 depending on if ur alliance/horde and HoJ happens to be one of them.
---
I just let them die.
---
This picture makes me dizzy
---
The pally was prot and trying to tank. I think he eventually gave up on that hope.
---
Seriously when are people going to stop posting personal issues on here? Not to be rude, but people really don‚Äôt care about this. Imagine if everyone on this sub posted every personal grievance here. It would be a shit show.
---
Remove him and move on.
---
Here's my policy when I tank with my feral druid.
---
1) Quickly outline what I want from the group at the start of the dungeon before the very first pull. Typically during the initial buffing phase.
---
2) If I notice people not observing my rules, especially in regards to AOEing and not focusing down my primary tanked target, I stop and advise them again of what I need from them for a smooth run. I might give them a second chance should this happen again.
---
3) If it keeps happening even after I've advised them, I leave. Tanks are scarce and I'm not at all inclined to spend the next couple of hours banging my fist on my desk because no one is doing what they're supposed to do. I can find new groups much more easily than they can find new tanks.
---
Note: I'm much more easy going if the group as a whole greatly outlevels that instance as I know the DPS can probably just tank those elites on their own, lol.
---
Yawn... Lol nice downvote for asking a question. What‚Äôs wrong with that?
---
Oh my, what a classy fellow.
---
It's nice to have a totem dropper that's always in melee range. Other than that, yeah not much benefit.
---
Wait, u can fish up essence of water?
---
Since overpower doesn't use GCD I generally try to stack it with mortal strike on top of white damage for a huge damage spike. Usually the rogue panics and will either very to vanish reset it run, which I then either use the bleed from deep wounds to expose them or hamstring and keep pressure on them. Maybe all the rogues I run into are just shit players like the cliche lol
---
25g per hour?
---
How does a healer or tank do this?
---
There are more classes in this game besides frost mage...
---
I can see where you're coming from, and looking back at my previous post I think that I shouldn't post things while hungry because it makes anything I write come off way less nice (read: dickish) than it sounded in my head. :&lt; 
---
Basically, what I feel is that PMs like 'tank ubrs?' like the previous poster pointed out do seem a bit lazy. I'm not expecting people to talk all posh and formal or use workplace email writing etiquette, just simple hellos and thank yous, basic politeness, is what I miss in game sometimes. For example, a 'hey :) we're looking for a tank for UBRS, would you like to come?' is already miles better, is polite enough, and not outlandishly formal for a game, and it's all I'm looking for in a similar interaction - in fact, any more niceties and it might even start looking creepy because of what everyone is used to in games. Meme away in group/guild/whatever chats (I've been known to do that myself actually), but I feel that when you target a specific person by whispering them, you should be able to actually say something like a normal person. Does that make sense?
---
Regarding your last sentence, I've actually never expressed this opinion of mine before (it was merely a shower thought until this post), so if I am insufferable it will be for other reasons most likely! :p
---
Search it in your AH for a couple of days and see what people are posting it for. Currently 35g on my server
---
Is this an EU realm?
---
Yea this guy doesn‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúviable‚Äù means. Lol
---
I don't ever gank Tauren but Undead are KOS for me as are any Horde rogues. I've played Tauren, Undead, Human, and Gnome, among others. Out of all races, Tauren are probably the coolest, and gnomes are the funniest. The Forsaken would betray the Horde the moment it's beneficial for them so I don't like them.
---
I dunno from the one guide I looked up they mentioned AoE farming post 32 and I‚Äôve witnessed Pallies using AoE spells to clear Stockades quickly
---
Oh that's a fun idea. Thanks!
---
Most lists have multiple items for slots, some have hit, some have defense.
---
However, keep in mind, the Pre- MC BIS list has a lot more damage mitigation than hit for a reason. In MC you are only ever tanking 1, sometimes 2 guys, so you don't need a whole bunch of rage and damage. 
---
Nothing in MC is immune to taunt either. So you can use taunt as your crutch for lack of rage from doing big hits. You'll get most of your rage from being hit, rather than hitting.
---
As healers get more geared, you start swapping out +defense items for more hit and crit.
---
Basically, the lists you are looking at are error-ing on the side of caution. As much damage mitigation as possible, then dropping the mitigation to a point where both you and your healers are comfortable.
---
This is a question more appropriate for retail WoW subreddit. R/wow. Has nothing to do with classic
---
Loaded questions are kinda old and tiring, I wish not to see much of them, sorry
---
Well, yes...
---
But you literally just said in this post that bears want def. So it's not a *terrible* stat.
---
It's not as good as it is for warriors or paladins by any stretch of the imagination.
---
But it's better than plenty of other stats for the sake of bear tanking.
---
I've said too much.
---
&gt; tool
---
There we go. Let it out.
---
Best to farm from Noon to 6pm(EST I believe).
---
I'm leaning towards the +5 damage since the mats are so much cheaper.
---
This isn‚Äôt a personal issue, imagine if everyone on this sub was as annoying as you? I thought it was silly/funny and I posted it. Shut the fuck up and move on
---
&gt; I thought nothing dropped from arena that a healer uses?
---
Which is why arena runs are always looking for a healer.
---
Fighting over Murlocs. Smart.
---
It‚Äôs griefing because theirs no counterplay. For tagging, you can race and still get tags off. You can‚Äôt stop banish (can‚Äôt kick or PvP same faction) and there‚Äôs no mechanism preventing banishing a mob tagged by another (as is the case with polymorph).
---
They intentionally removed a mages capability to sheep mobs tagged by others for similar reasons. People complain about tactics used to try and steal devilsaur skins, imagine if you sat and tried to kill one and a mage comes and polymorphs it, causing it to heal faster than you can damage it. If the mage is same faction, there‚Äôs ZERO counterplay. That‚Äôs griefing.
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt even notice that
---
Yeah, generally I'd say...you have to take the bad to get the good.
---
However, one thing I'm ok with...
---
&gt; Tanks skipping half mobs in a dungeon because that is the optimal way . 
---
If the skipping results in missing key things or wipes due to aggroing too many mobs on accident, this is a problem.
---
But skipping mobs we don't need to kill because they don't matter for anything is perfectly acceptable to me.
---
I know this isn't answering your question, but for perspective: level 44 is about the halfway point in terms of xp and time required to level to 60.
---
Eavesdrop
---
Wish I could upvote more than once
---
Even with my guild, at some point the run turns to "you pull it, you tank it". Stops pretty fast when the druids res is on cd.
---
Batlands
---
Yeah, I conflated farming with grinding for levels and they're not the same thing. Makes sense that it would be tougher at max level if you're not spec'd into wand and ST.
---
I don't plan on spec'ing into holy for a long while, so I guess I don't have to worry about that at the moment. From my perspective, priest is solid at farming at the moment.
---
Yeah American "left" is basically center-right in most other western cultures.
---
Its more like 1/3 reduction because quests count for a little more than half of total xp gained and quests dont get the double xp. But fun idea I like it and love playing my alt with a level or two of rested xp.
---
Im a horde, and was running up the coast at south shore leveling fishing.  Came across a bunch of lowbie allies.  Saved them from murlocs in exchange for fishing in peace.
---
Seems plauseble but do u even get rested at lvl 1?
---
Why does the best sword that will last for a few phases have to be so ugly? Lmao
---
Has anyone been getting wierd pulls in lbrs or scholo?
---
Lbrs: engaged ogres in the head on Pike event, and all of a sudden both sets of Scorpions came and rekt us.
---
Scholo: spectral teachers who disappear didn't come back....  And then what felt like the entire instance worth of trash aggroed us
---
We demand equal heights
---
if its "just" a name, then give it to them
---
Posting personal issues and yet so friendly too, what a winner
---
You can literally see it in the details tab that BTT was enhance, it shows spec next to his name
---
Yeah you can't really tank when someone is cleaving like that. Best to just throw on a 2-hander and do DPS, haha.
---
can i turn on do not disturb and write ok, like /dnd ok
---
so if he writes again, would the reply "ok" go through the ignore?
---
Dismissing others is exactly what you just did with your ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather play WoW than statistics‚Äù comment lol holy shit the irony
---
Could you post the Macro?
---
I understand your fear. I'm level 41 with 75g. Yesterday I had 50g. I'd try to farm scarlet or badlands earth elementals. The gorillas northeast of Booty Bay have pretty good chance to drop greens and their vendor trash sells well. Plus you can skin them if either of you have skinning.
---
I think the community is good because it *exists*. There *are* good and bad people in it. It‚Äôs just that in Classic, you are a part of that, and not seperate. 
---
Anecdotally, my experience up to level 50-ish has been mostly excellent. I‚Äôve obviously had a handful of people that I know not to play with anymore, but that‚Äôs not the majority.
---
I don't have briarwood reed, FeelsBadMan. I've SUCCESSFULLY lost the roll 5 times.
---
Gnome, so Edgemasters it is. Follow-up question: if a mace drops that is higher DPS than whatever weapon in have at the time, should I pass on it because I don't get the +mace skill?
---
2nd one has a much lower drop rate, doesn' tit?
---
Just an FYI.  There was a blue post last week that gave a list of the 5 servers that were down to 1 layer each; the rest of the servers are down to 2 layers each.
---
If you‚Äôve got that much played time in per week since launch and are 42 you‚Äôre just very inefficient. Not saying that‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs just true.
---
&gt; Tank specs suck hard in PvP. Tanking gear is generally useless in PvP. 
---
In a guild WSG we had our Prot Tank carry the flag and we watched as the opposing team tried to take him down, while we healed him.  (I forget if he was wearing Prot Gear, or Grand Marshal Gear, but he respecced after getting GM for raids).
---
Needless to say, we got a lot of HKs, and he had 3 Flag Caps. I had dug up the screenshot right before classic started up when nostalgia was hitting hard.
---
I guess you forgot to put /s?
---
I obtained the item in classic and I am asking about the classic value. Has everything to do with classic.
---
lmao, I've had the opposite experience (but I also don't do many dungeons). The gnome mages have been really nice. It's been mostly druids who have been assholes.
---
/u/WeirdAside might be disabled. The chance of getting 5 sequential numbers (in any order) is (I think). 96*(1/100^5 * 5!)
---
NA east I believe.
---
You dont want a mace. Axes: Bonebiter ot pravager. Ravager is easy enough to get, has a nice aoe proc that I still use at 59 to farm stockades. 
---
If it procs when you dont to want it to any other action will cancel it, such as battle shout or MS or whatever
---
Personally I still use Stoneslayer from ulda as Ive not came across anything with the high top damage
---
Tell waapti to quit crying.
---
I think tailoring could be worth keeping, especially if you want to hold onto it/use it at end game, but enchanting is one of those things where it's really hard to keep it up while you level unless a bunch of people are funneling greens at you. Maybe if you dungeon grind it's beneficial? I started vendoring everything over 30s because holy god enchanting mats are worthless if I use them (and weren't worth much on AH--IDK about now).
---
I personally wouldn't change at this point, because quest rewards pick up in a big way after 40, but IMO feel free to disregard enchanting a little bit until you get to cap. It'll be easier to go back and catch it up then, and it's one less headache to worry about while you're leveling. :D
---
That‚Äôs what you do, just keep paying it forward
---
Im from eu sadly
---
You cant, at higher levels your pet doesnt eat the cheap stuff
---
Goodbye epic mount, hello epic gear.
---
Lasts you all the way till Bonebiter.... Axe.... 1/195 ..
---
&gt;how would we value this in classic
---
Thanks, I will have to look into it again. I was always so confused by weak auras so I never really made use of it.
---
As are Pigbenis and Tigbitsmcgee
---
I actually avoid grouping for these quests because I have no intention of hanging around.  The only reason to group would be if there‚Äôs few mobs and many people fighting to tag it.
---
Right? "omg so mad look they defending lol"
---
Do you have screech learned in your pet training list?
---
There could be multiple problems and it is hard to diagnose from just what you've provided.
---
If you don't have it in your pet training menu then you still need to fight with your Fleshripper until you learn the skill.
---
If you do have it, make sure you have enough training points available to teach the ability to your Owl. It might be necessary to either: level up your pet, go up a loyalty level, or respec.
---
Yup. I‚Äôve seen 2 HoJ‚Äôs. 
---
Statistically speaking, I should never play the lottery.
---
That's your cue that you can say something ridiculous about him in trade chat and see what silliness it may ignite without him being able to see what started it.
---
As a pala, fighting rogues has been like fighting mobs so far, and I kill mobs 10 at a time.
---
Probably, but this method is guaranteed to get you pretty good money if you're a low level without rich friends or much knowledge of the game.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that actually be a pretty good motivator for the community to fix faction imbalance?
---
Did Ony earlier this week. Saw some guy rolled a 98 on the bag, my helm still waiting to be rolled for, me: "I'm not even going to roll, what if I roll a 97? Fuck it, I'll roll anyway" *rolls a 2 on the bag then a (winning) 98 on the helm*
---
I was the tank.
---
wait why
---
As long as you are having fun in the limited amount of time that you have to play does it really matter if you are the asshole?
---
Organized? A bunch of you guys the other day tried to raid org and got killed by the guards alone. In what way was that productive?
---
I went from borrowing 45g at 40 for my mount to buying a Devilsaur set (~300g) and a Flurry axe (250g) in about three weeks.  Gold ramps up fast.
---
That is fucking bullshit. If I as a warrior can hide in a bush and have my model not be seen, i shouldnt be outed by an addon
---
There's a mage trainer at the troll camp in durotar, no mage trainer at razorhill  so I assume it's so people don't have to walk all the way to org to train
---
We're playing on a hybrid patch 1.12. We have the mechanics and bug fixes of 1.12, but content is obviously following a different release cycle. I think battlegrouping is a big enough change that it should be considered for a later release.
---
You should have said ‚Äúopen trade‚Äù instead of saying yes over and over. Standard mage
---
40 people is not required. Great gear is not required. Meta specs are not required. Thats all hes saying. He never said any 25 people could clear all content easy. Youre just trying to sound correct.
---
Why?  The average might be 2 orbs per run, and it's probably less.   That's 40g.   40g/5 people = 8g.  Takes like an hour, so thats 8g + w/e else you get.
---
Grats brother !
---
No problem! Glad I could help! If you intend to ready her for raiding nonetheless (attunement), the first part of the attunement quest for Onyxia rewards you with a pair of gloves (Voone's Vice Grips) that give +2% hit, 9 agi and 6 stam. You can then equip those to keep that hit % and grab an alternate pair of legs with no harm done (well, you lose 2% crit unless you find a pair of legs that gives you that back, but eh)
---
I have 10 days on alliance and just rolled horde. The balance is not that bad. Where are you pulling these numbers? Your ass is not a valid reference.
---
It took a guildy over 500 arena runs to get the chest
---
It would be yes.  I wasn't disagreeing lol.
---
DID SOMEONE SAY  \[Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker\] ???
---
Join my group to get me loot. Ignored.
---
It comes down to how they look. Do they look like mage shoulders or rogue shoulders?  
---
TBH they are more useful to the rogue because mages shouldn‚Äôt be taking hits ever
---
As you stated earth shock is a high threat generator, rock biter is a threat generator, if they keep reapply their lightning shield that‚Äôll hold aggro obviously. There is also a warrior study showing demoshout spamming is more aggro effecting than sundering but that might have been patched. Regardless I play enhance and can easily pull aggro if I blow my wad before the warrior gets a good grip. If your shaman is grabbing aggro ask them to cast flameshock instead of earthshock (unless needed to silence then use rank 1 earthshock) and at 30 they‚Äôll switch to WF which when it procs can pull aggro but is less aggro intensive as rockbiter.
---
Bish bash bosh.
---
IIRC the key ring they said they just didn't have it ready for release and as such they'd add it when they did their 1st major patch.
---
when i am on my mage i have water ready and make a statement once before the run starts, "Open trade for water/food", during the time it takes to finish the instance if anyone opens trade with me, i dont ask, just pop in some food/water (what their class may need) and go on, if no one trades i assume they have what they need. 
---
oh and the priest is the jerk
---
I‚Äôm sure he could of cared less about you‚Äôre hatred
---
^^^^that ^^^^hurt ^^^^to ^^^^type
---
If you want to do a dungeon and you want to get as many quest completed as possible in one run i reccomend checking wow head for an overview of the available quest as sometimes the rewards are definitely worth running across Azeroth to pick up! https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow

EDIT3 10/7/19
---
* Updated functionality for fear ward
---
* Positioning and size of buffs for clarity
---
* Re-checked all Prayers are enabled
---
done!
---
My friends hate me for it, but I‚Äôm on a mission to befriend all Horde I come across. I give em a nice /wave and /hug as I pass by, will help out if they seem in trouble, etc.
---
Some higher level guys still kill me, but that‚Äôs what makes the ones who are nice about it all the more enjoyable.
---
I need more Impractical Jokers memes in my life &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs an idea, especially for Live Strat which has little incentive for tanks.
---
Hahaha this is ridonkulous. You can't possibly be mad at the mage there lol
---
Who wants a bird to suck their dick anyway?
---
That's what bothers me more than anything about Classic, besides bid sorting in the AH I suppose.
---
Thunderclap should be usable in Prot Stance.
---
But how does this work with contribution towards the 9% hit cap? If i have an axe on offhand thats still yellow hitcap then? Or it only aplies to the skills that does main-hand only damage?
---
If you find anything by any chance, please tell! I‚Äòm looking for this addon too..
---
Got second wind on my first Golem kill. I feel bad for you and hope you get it soon!
---
There are no reinforcements in the 1.12 version.
---
They removed some NPCs and made them overall a little easier to kill, but it's still very much the old-school AV that many of us remember.
---
its bis for hunters bro, there is no other dps trinket for alliance
---
My experience was smooth from the getgo. Maybe it‚Äôs cause I started about a month late.
---
I WILL. however it's going to take time. i won't be home for another 4 hrs.
---
What level was your problem? Lets say level 20. You cant hold aggro. Even if you were the maintank for some hardcore raiding guild. If DPS does not know what they are doing at low level, you will lose your aggro almost instantly. 
---
Only if you lose aggro to the heal mid fight (as in not at the start but in the middle of it) you are doing something wrong.
---
I am priest, mage always opens trade at their leisure. I have my own water f they don‚Äôt have time to open trade. Who cares
---
The % hit is calculated per mh/oh. There's no weird averaging, or mh only logic like there are with certain weapon abilities.
---
So you have to use double axes as Orc. It's why human is the best overall race for fury warriors, as swords are easier/better on average as you progress the raid tiers.
---
I think wsg/ab was &lt;30 minutes on my server. AV games would pop 2-3 times at night and mostly during primetime. Honestly 30m queue is not that much longer than what it takes to build a group and travel to an instance. And yeah I guess some people had a lot worse experience. 
---
To me, cross realm battlegrounds are similar to LFG tools. Well meaning quality of life improvements that end up destroying a part of the game.
---
Items like this are highly valued because of xmogs, outside of RP realms they won't be getting a ton of value in classic. It's a solid item, but most people aren't making 39 bracket twink healers.
---
Level 32 dwarf hunter, looking for tips on the best dungeons for making money. I've heard solo dungeon runs are a good strategy but I'm not sure which dungeons I should try to solo at this level.
---
Winter fall firewater
---
They were both idiots.
---
I'm pretty good at keeping my mana up, don't go oom much. Moving around happens a lot I'd say for various reasons (someone nearby pulls aggro, mob moved out of range, etc). I've also noticed it takes me too long to switch targets. I usually tab target since click targeting is difficult especially when there's a lot of enemies (I do have nameplates on and stacking). Not sure if there's a better way.
---
I feel like part of it too is that I'm usually focused on my threat meter. Ony and Rag are two fights where at least in one phase you can go balls to the walls as ranged. Since I'm not worried about threat I just watch my castbar which seems to result in me getting off way more casts. Thing is, I'm always watching it in the corner of my eye so I'm hesitant to pin that as the main cause, though it's all I can come up with at the moment.
---
If you‚Äôre using 2 axes you need 6% hit. If you are using something other than axes, 9%.
---
I bet said tailor only did it to level his tailoring skill. I haven't checked any guides, but I'll bet the bags have the least money spend / skillpoint. Even better if you get the mageweave for free.
---
On my server a stack of mageweave was the same price as a bag, so I just crafted it until the skill went green.
---
There is no port to TB. The druid flight path is off to the right through the inn.
---
Surely there has been enough of these and we are due for a backlash sometime soon...  
---
"Saw a level 60 skinning the gorillas I was killing, I couldn't solo Stranglethorn Fever alone, so I used /beckon and /point to lead him to the cave. He immediately stealthed and a few seconds later ambushed me for my entire health bar. He then ganked me repeatedly for several hours, never missing an opportunity to /spit on my lifeless corpse. While corpse camping me he seemed to kill a bunch of gorilla's for their skins without my help. yay!"
---
did you kill him after he helped?
---
yea 100%
---
Southshore should be fine to get another level or two. It includes Alterac quests which have mobs up to lvl 39. Dustwallow is one or two questruns so maybe half a level, quite easy quests. Might wanna do some SM runs for both gear and xp as well
---
6 what
---
Serious question as a paladin. Is there any point at all to being the "best" 5 man tank? Being the "best" insinuates max-mining and theres no heroics so theres really no dungeons that take any max mining to clear.
---
He should be able to get the desired item if the other person prioritises other gear than Vis'kag. Else, yes he should wait in line for a year. The person having the same attendance as him but started trying to get the sword a year earlier is definately more entitled to it.
---
If the other person bids his points on T1 gear, an OH or other stuff, the person in the back suddenly moves further up by quite a margin.
---
Could fix being a jackass, but you seem dead set on being one. Gl.
---
Orc prot warrior. I‚Äôm level 53 and starting to look for BiS gear to keep an eye out for. Does anyone have a list or a link to a simple BiS. I have googled various things but don‚Äôt really understand the different phases and variety to BiS seeing as I‚Äôve never made it this far in WoW and am pretty much a noob
---
This exp punishment was implemented only later on in wows history. I don‚Äôt believe there is a punishment for having a higher level.
---
I have Stealthblade which people are saying sells between 50k-100k gold on retail, but only 40g or so on AH. Im just gonna keep it cause it looks cool.
---
If you're alliance and the raid lead said caster dps only that's a rip
---
That chest is BiS for holy pala , same with mageblade
---
One of the lesser reasons I didn't.roll alliance for classic even though I prefer alliance and gnomes
---
One day.. but today is not that day
---
No I haven‚Äôt played on private servers. I only played throughout vanilla. 
---
I guess the private server community may have bad experiences that weren‚Äôt as prevalent in vanilla
---
because DKP would have prevented this...
---
My experience is only from a private server, but I didnt switch to fury until I had devulsaur set, Blackstone ring, wyrmhide spaulders, and something else with 1% hit on it. I was 58 I think. 2h is the way to go I guess.
---
Because there is two mob packs for rep with Timbermaw and Deadwood ones in Felwood tend to be heavily camped with a few parties at least.
---
You actually should go back to BFA, it sounds like it's more your speed
---
I honestly don't think people like this deserve to have their names censored.  If there's overwhelming evidence, show everyone who the idiot is.
---
Sick!
---
Even more impressive to see you were allowed to roll on it at all.
---
Regardless of main/offhand? What about the skills that are mainhand only?
---
So unspoken that no one has heard of it... lol
---
And its shit.
---
#AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT
---
The set will carry you to the mid 50's, I'm just about to upgrade some pieces from the endgame dungeons BRD and Scholo. 
---
It's just that strong of a set, even if it lacks stamina.
---
Is priest the go-to healer if I want to heal end-game for dungeons and raids? Healing seems interesting to me but I can't really decide between druid for the fast leveling, paladin for the hybrid nature, or priest for all-out healing. I had a shadow-spec priest way back in original vanilla but now I know that their DPS isn't competitive.
---
Agree
---
Cool I'll try again then.
---
I understand that vending grays is different. My point is that this different activity that no one could possibly find objectionable can also be described as greedy. So we shouldn't put much stock in such descriptions. Since either side of the All Need debate can be described as greedy such accusations not useful in determining which system is better.
---
The logic **does not** work with BoP items because they are not equivalent to gold. You can sell them but you cannot buy them for gold. When they drop that is the only opportunity to get the item. With BoP items the opportunity costs can be easily measured in gold.
---
In my experience, people that put smiley faces in chat are disproportionately passive-aggressive assholes.
---
I would stick with the Thrash Blade MH, Vanq OH. The lifeforce dirk would be useful if you used a macro to switch to swords immediately after opening with ambush
---
I conjure a shit tonne of water and tell people to trade me for water. It's not our job to micromanage who needs water and when.
---
You‚Äôre continuously arguing a ridiculous point where you are patently wrong and refusing to listen to players who clearly have more experience. What exactly did you expect?
---
But my vending machine...
---
What server/faction?
---
If you still haven't gotten Screech after playing with it ALL weekend I would retame a new Greater Fleshripper and try again. Maybe you experienced some weird bug. It should not take hours and hours to learn a skill. The longest it has taken me to learn a pet skill so far is 30 minutes (level 40 hunter, have learned ~15 skills so far. Usually I learn it within 10 minutes.)
---
At 60 you get extra gold instead of XP rewards. Dungeon quests are often not time efficient due to all the traveling as you said, unless you plan in advance and fit them into your questing route. Some questing guides manage to accomodate long chains spanning many zones, but they usually don't cover dungeons.
---
That said, running dungeons is not about XP/hour but about fun, so personally I tried to get and complete every dungeon quest. Except gnomer, fuck that place.
---
Nice video but really nothing new here, I mean, all you're doing is making potions that sells for the most money. If you're on a low-medium pop server this is very easy to do but on a full server the competition is very fierce. Also if you're anything other than an alchemist it's really tough to make money from crafting.
---
i mean, BFA literally had 2 distinct horde and alliance islands, but there was plenty of interaction
---
"Assistant branch manager?"
---
"Assistant TO THE branch manager*"
---
"Same thing"
---
I did some of those as a fresh 60 and got like 6 pieces of gear and over 8k rep in a couple hours. I even got the cloak of Baron which is something many people struggle to get.
---
Absolutely worth it and people are a fool to mock it. Maybe it isn't for you but it's a good money making strategy for the leader and helps the others get gear that is otherwise much harder to obtain.
---
I don't think typing /who playername counts as stalking 
---
Now if you searched social media for his character name and found out his real identity, where he lived, etc, and went to his house to hand deliver a cake that has "Learn to play noob" written in icing, that would be stalking.
---
Look for grinding guides on Google.  There are tons out there.  I've been following [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbRXBu1PSPA) on both my warrior and priest.  They are 28 and 26 respectively and it's been a pretty good guide so far.
---
Trueaim gloves aren‚Äôt bad once you get a bow, you can also use voones gloves from the LBRS quest for 2% hit.
---
Legwise you can use most things with voones.
---
You lose some stats but considering how quickly you could replace devilsaur it might be worth it.
---
It has actually changed because of these farm groups in zf
---
I pretty much only scroll through the daily question threads on this sub, i'd agree the rest of the posts on this sub is meh. There is tons of good info in the daily question threads whether you are just starting out or have played a while.
---
Alright, so ive tried a few different healing addons/setups and none of them seem to fit what i want.  Looking for some advice/suggestions.
---
-------
---
Vuhdo: I have a couple of annoyances with it. 
---
 First, is there a way to disable the out of combat auto-dispel?  If im not in combat it tries to do that and it appears to be very bugged on Classic (says theres nothing to dispel because its trying to use dispel magic if theres a disease on them, and i cant heal the person until i put myself into combat).
---
Second, and probably most importantly: Is there a way to downrank with Vuhdo?  Ive tried manually typing it in, but it doesnt seem to work.
---
Third, is there an easy way to set it up to to show things like Fear Ward?  Trying to keep that up on tanks is a nightmare.  I tried fiddling around with the settings for buffs/debuffs, but was pretty overwhelmed trying to figure it out.
---
Grid/Clique:
---
Is there a way to make clique ONLY work on raid frames?  its 100% a deal breaker for me to have it behave the same on all frames.  Not being able to bind right/left click to a heal on raid frames, but still having it act normal on my player/target/pet/whatever frames is 100% not going to work for me.
---
------
---
Healbot: I have a few annoyances that i cant even remember (only tried it last night), but hopefully im remembering the big ones.  I'd rather not use it, but if i cant get Vuhdo to work and theres no other alternatives, it might be my only option.
---
Is there a way to change the logic it uses for how it sorts the groups in the frames when you have multiple rows?  Its driving me bat shit crazy that it puts group 2 below group 1 instead of having 1-4 in the top row, and 5-8 in the bottom row.
---
Maybe i missed a setting, but is there a way to make it show other priests' renews on the target?  Same with Weakened Soul.  It baffles me that it shows me a mage's ice barrier (and something else that im forgetting right now) but not very important things that i actually need to see.
---
They're probably feeling uphappy.
---
I was farmin heavy for thorium brotherhood the other day and followed around a lvl 43 horde warlock for about an hour waiting for them to get the tag, then killed and skinned. They were pretty grateful with the emotes and jumping.
---
The priest should not have had to ask for water.  The mage should open trade with each party member that has a Mana bar and offer them water.
---
I may have exaggerated on the whelps thing, but nevertheless, the purpose of this setup remains that you're free to do as you please, and it won't stop you (again, almost, I know, the cape and the ring, I KNOW) from gearing up just because you'd rather run around mining a bunch of stuff, grinding some whelps, crafting stuff for people or something else entirely!
---
The entire point is freedom. You don't HAVE to sit through that dungeon 59 more times until lady luck graces you with her presence. You don't have to sit there and watch rng screw you, sending you back in there another 33 times for the next drop that hopefully you won't lose to another player AGAIN... 
---
You're free to do that, if you want, or you're free to not do that.
---
I don't dislike grouping or doing dungeons. I dislike doing the exact same thing for hours if it isn't something I am in the mood for. Let's be honest, sometimes it is more like DAYS or WEEKS or MONTHS. Being alliance back in vanilla, I grinded out Hand of Justice, and with 6+ hours of dungeon-running daily, it took me 5 weeks to obtain it. I don't even want to count the amount of runs it took, and I think it only dropped like 4 times. 
---
Can't even remember why I wanted it back then, I wasn't thinking much about BiS stuff and such, but I just know I made sure I'd never wanna go back to that dungeon ever again. 
---
I'm actually very social and interact with nearly everybody I meet in-game. It has nothing to do with wanting to play a single-player game. I just don't want to feel limited most of the time. This "list" ensures that regardless of what I do, in most cases, I can be working towards an upgrade without having to do something specific (unless you count "making gold through any means necesssary" as a specific action).
---
Why is frostitute worth of report?  If the guy wasn't being a jackass no way I'm reporting that name..
---
Yep I farm there for Eko and firewater. Rep is just a bonus.
---
Can you give me the link of that ToS ? I need that, i just open request, i'm gonna send it too
---
Combat Sword spec.  The extra attack proc resets your swing time.  If it procs off a white hit, cool.  If you proc an extra off an ability right BEFORE your white hit attack.. then basically you just got the proc hit but reset your white hit that was about to land anyway.. effectively nullifying any extra damage.
---
PS: I'm not an expert but this is the way I understand it works.
---
Oh, that's a lot. Maybe I should clarify -- I'm under level 40 and really only ever need 1-2 stacks before I'm logging off.
---
Faerlina Alliance
---
man. when i got carried through some raids for the achievement, it was need all for all. the carries were free too.
---
some guilds, seriously...
---
although i got carried because i was in the same guild, just on the pvp side not the pve side. so mightve been diff. for random.
---
Can u get a life
---
They're closer to 68-70%.
---
same :)
---
I see Chef Nomi is trying to make his speciality burnt food.
---
Thanks. I thought we redeemed the marks for reputation that is needed for the gear and that we also get xp for redeeming them, isnt that correct?
---
However we dont need to get reputation with redeeming marks, as we will get reputation just from playing WSG. Or?
---
Yep. Almost always the case. Once in a while people do ridiculous things but if it happens all the time you‚Äôre doing something wrong.
---
It's still easy kills that drop silver, runecloth, and give rep. It's not a terrible mob to grind.
---
I hit lvl 39 and had 4 gold to my name. I ignored the advice about staying away from the AH and not buying skills/upgrades.
---
Took me two days but I farmed enough for my mount by the time I hit 41.5.
---
I haven‚Äôt *earned* something in a video game in quite some time. I‚Äôm still elated.
---
RemindMe! 4 hours
---
You can grind the crimson whelp in NE wetlands, east of the dark iron dwarf encampment. They drop the rare pet but more importantly they drop small flame sac that sells for around 35-1g each depending on server.
---
YTA. I've seen similar things as people Q up to get the final spawn of a quest chain or something. There might b 8 people, 5 of whom are grouped. It's quicker for everyone if you are orderly, but really nothing stopping you from being an asshole and tagging it. It's basically "If I can, should I?" sometimes no, it makes you an asshole.
---
There's a lot of mistakes in the quest descriptions. 50 here and I've seen at least a dozen.
---
My gripe is that you're assuming it's lazy, and assuming that they're unable to say something like a normal person when in the context of the situation - it's very normal to speak like that.  It's less work to spam "LF TANK UBRS" in LFG than it is to find someone and message them.  The example you posted, "hey :)", I mean whenever someone sends me that I'm anticipating a netflix &amp; chill type follow up, kinda meme worthy in its own right.    
---
I think it's just personal preference, which for me, I really don't care about formalities at all and I'd be willing to bet most people don't care in the context of playing a recreational video game in their free time.  And this is coming from someone with an English degree.  In the end, I wouldn't judge people because of how they communicate unless it's egregious, which "tank ubrs?", is not.
---
Gay*lord*
---
Well, this is one option I am considering, but people probably won't even be wanting these until Phase 3 when BG's come out. So I was trying to get a general idea of how much I could just sell the plans for right now vs. holding onto them and having them possibly drop in price as more people get them before phase 3.
---
Checking in.
---
It sounds like you need to find a guild that you enjoy the people in and are active endgame players. If you have issues with PUG mindsets then stop pugging.
---
Hunter in PvP is harder than rogues though. Getting a CD tracking addon and spamming CC is literally braindead.
---
I'm playing a priest healer and I am having trouble where I have too much threat in certain fights. Does anyone know about a healers mod or threat mod that will show me where my threat stands compared to the tank? My party is using Details! and the threat meter there seems to only show DPS threat.
---
I love it
---
I'm an adult with a job, its been a month+ since it came out lol.
---
I completely understand some reservations. Something like a tank shield for a guild's offtank where you have 7 guildies who don't even need any gear and just need 3 more to fill out the group. In those cases if you are just going for one or 2 pieces and the rest of your group doesn't need anything then it is more than fair. To outright reserve all leather/mail/plate or something is taking it way too far though.
---
You can definitely start ZF at 44, and I‚Äôd only go to 50 then you can do maraudon. Then sunken temple after a couple levels.
---
Oh no look at all the egg on my face.  Oh wait nobody cares
---
But it needs to be farmed to get onto the ah... no offense but it seems like your just mad that other people are playing in an area you want to farm for yourself.
---
If you want it for some reason, others will obviously have reasons to be there as well. Gang up and kill them, to lessen the competition?
---
I'm not sure, I just see people talking about it a lot when this question comes up. I'm alliance so I didn't get the chance to try it out.
---
Only lucrative if it's uncontested really. There's no way it is when you have to wait 5 mins for a respawn every time because there's 5 other dudes there
---
Yeah, my dilemma right now is choosing to whether to continue leveling as ret for solo questing outside dungeons or switch to holy to spam BRD but not be able to quest solo.
---
BRE is one of the dopest swords in classic
---
The reason they make it look like a grilled halibut, I'll never know 
---
JUST MAKE IT A BIT LONGER EVEN JEEZ
---
If this happened, your name was changed because it violates naming policy. Renaming it to the same thing will likely result in a suspension next time, and if you keep doing it the suspensions will get longer. Your best bet would be to send in a ticket explaining you didn't understand why your name was changed but don't want to get suspended for it and request another name change.
---
I'll suggest the addon LetMeCast which dismounts you automatically when you try to use a spellcast of any sort, and makes you stand up if you're sitting down and press a spellcast. :) Like anything else, you have to press Charge twice to charge, but the auto dismount is nice.
---
If your name is against TOS then yes.  If not appeal in a ticket and the people falsely reporting will most likely get temporary bans.
---
Just your friendly neighboorhood Shadra
---
Recently horde was planning on raiding westfall...Then we had a change of plans and instead raided SW.
---
idk if this helps though
---
A horde helped me complete a quest at Tanaris some days ago, and after I waved him 2 alliance players came and insta killed him :(
---
What‚Äôs ur character name?
---
I apologize for those Hordies who killed him. I would 100% respect this dude :/
---
Ill take whatever option gives the shortest queue times please.
---
btw masterloot was set to someone else, by the time we got back to the boss the items despawned &gt;:(  
---
idk why we didnt have a SS up, RIP!
---
41 mount club here too! I found grinding for my mount to be one of the most rewarding things so far. Well, that and killing horde.
---
some of us are lucky, as i got mine i think withing the 1st lap, the next day in STV got hyacinth macaw.
---
/u/5H3R
---
You guys have any resource you used to know which spots are best at all levels? I am actually really interested in doing some lifeless grinding
---
This makes me want to create a new character and message the person who ignored me so I can get the last word in. That'll show 'em!
---
Thousand Needles is where I lvl'd at that time. Then arathi/desolace after that.
---
I'm pretty sure they will. They're considering adding them once more players get to max level, so hopefully within a month or 2.
---
&gt;We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We'll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm.
---
Definitely not. The loot tables in classic have really weird items that don't always fit into typical class archetypes, and this is the perfect example.
---
What are zoomers?
---
I just don't see any reason for Horde to camp it. Alliance has a valid reason because of wintersaber. Horde doesn't.

---
Not sure if this helps you, but here it is

I haven't yet ignored anyone for an actual interaction, I have only ever ignored people because they were spamming unmitigated stupidity or a macro in zone chat.  I go through and clear it out every once and a while cause I'm really just using it as a mute.

Ya idk what his deal is...sure you aren‚Äôt a cloth wearer, but he should be able to make better shoulders himself by that lv

I got three blue dreamweave items for cheap by farming wildvine/mageweave from trolls in the hinterlands.
---
No it's not scummy 
---
People might not appreciate it but what are you supposed to do? Pass on your BiS?
---
It's dkp, my guild is too, meaning open market. If they want it more than you, let em show it through a bid.
---
I‚Äôm so over it. I couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck about people rolling numbers and getting lucky???
---
Pretty gay.
---
Check out LetMeCast addon
---
Yeah you can get in earlier, I was just questing and got a message from someone asking if I wanted to join the raid so I said sure lol
---
If your name was considered offensive and you were asked to change it, and you didn't change it, the next time it gets reported you could be heading for a ban. Because all actions against your account are recorded and whoever gets the next report will be able to see it.
---
I mean, if I was working the case I'd be like, "Didn't he get the message the first time? Looks like he needs a vacation to contemplate things more carefully."
---
Yes Reddit is full of shit people and you're swimming in the pool man
---
Desolace
---
I remember the quest. Mage actually can do it solo with kiting :P
---
But ye what an ass lol.
---
Why is this a wow playlist and not just any other playlist for people who happen to like specifically those songs?
---
It was never hard to interrupt lockdown a paladin as a warrior.
---
Anyone ever wish you could heal the opposite faction when you know the dude trying to gank them from your own side is just being a griefing dickhead?
---
Yeah doesn't work. Second time I've made a run at this and bust. 
---
Same as others here, no data to be found in the import data screen in Gathermate2, just all greyed out. Not sure why it would be such a leap to import my own already found nodes into Routes but I guess it doesn't work that way?
---
&gt;Oh wait nobody cares   
---
That explains the entire subreddit dedicated to finding this stuff.  
---
Anyway even if nobody cares, at least you learned something here today.

I suspect its the ghosting/blocking internet culture seeping into wow culture.  Its too easy to cut people off without facing any consequences.
---
both
---
I hate ST, and thankfully I had a guild run through that! 
---
In most solo quests I can get by via offering 2-3g for a player or two to help kill elites (duskwing, etc) to keep moving along swiftly, but dungeons are another beast all together.
---
I blame my heavy Danish/Asian accent xD
---
I always love the mismatched raiding gear at pre raid. Grats btw
---
I don‚Äôt see the issue if I‚Äôm able to hit 350-400 dps in molten core. People are obsessed with the insane notion that the class makes the player but don‚Äôt take in to account player capability. You have a boomkin on WC logs right now with a consistent 500 dps on all bosses that‚Äôs really high. 
---
The 1400 dps fury warriors are abusing the fact a fight is lasting 30 seconds with a stacked raid that‚Äôs unrealistic.
---
Given time people will hopefully open up more as they form and make their own opinions instead of regurgitating the general consensus portrayed by years of lack of information. 
---
Fact is, players are just much better now then we were 15 years ago and far more informed.
---
Has anyone seen a scope drop yet?
---
Yes it is, I do it all the time. Not that hard to zig zag behind a rock my guy. You don't need to hyperanalyze or get defensive about something you don't immedietly understand.
---
the guy is clearly not from the US...
---
Locks are usually my favorite people to fight. I play a druid and I try to pick fights with locks on sight. I've only run into maybe half a dozen of them, but I haven't lost a fight yet. It's a really fun challenge trying to kill you Bastards lol
---
You can usually skip 3-4 packs until you see the torch carrier and then jump off and go directly to him
---
I‚Äôm trying to make this as simple as is possible, man.
---
Using 2 axes - 6% hit
---
Not using 2 axes - 9% hit
---
Banned? I'd understand a name change would be appropriate but a ban is clearly uncalled for.
---
üôÅ
---
You can make solid cash with Alchemy and Herb at around 45+ when you start getting raid consumables. The 25 agi/2% crit potion is super ez to make and goes for 5g+ a pop on my server.   
---
Probably less useful for a druid then a warrior though
---
Seems like fakenews.
---
I appreciate you answering my question but i can say that my question is now answered.
---
How does the weapon skill apply to abilties that use mainhand/offhand is the question. If i have an axe in my offhand and dont reach 9% hit but have one in my main hand, how does abilities like whirlwind and bloodthirst work with the hit because they are not main-hand/offhand abilities?
---
Just to make sure, this is the menu accessed from the Beast Training skill in your spellbook? You're not looking for it at the pet trainer?
---
It's a complex issue and it's not necessarily as cut-and-dry as a lot of people like to think it is.
---
Essentially, incompetent people tend to overrate themselves - it's why it's so common to see that guy coming in, guns blazing, very quick to brag about how he's the best player in the raid or how he's "been playing WoW for 15 years" - only to die to the first mechanic that presents any remote level of difficulty. He think's he's hot shit, because he lacks the level of competence to see *why* he's not there yet, to see *what* he's lacking.
---
For people who are *genuinely* great, they've often reached the level where they can see what they're missing - they see what they could be doing better. They see every mistake they make clear as day. They're hard on themselves because they understand that they don't know all there is to know, so they tend to underrate their own competence - because they're aware of what they could be doing better, or they can see what they could improve on. And yet, they'll outperform most people they encounter. They might even be *surprised* that they're doing so much better than others. And yes, as you touched upon, they might even assume that others are on the same level as them - because how hard could it be to interrupt the mob casting a healing spell, right?
---
That's it in a nutshell. There's obviously a lot of generalisation going on and in the real world (of warcraft) there will be a bit of variance, but in the years I've played this game I've found it to be remarkably accurate for the most part. So much so that it's almost uncanny, actually.
---
Literally none cares about your shitty mount rep man. The mobs drops valuable stuff, ofc there is gonna be people there. Also how do you think firewater and winterfall e'ko are gonna be on horde AH if according to you, only alliance have reason to grind there?
---
&gt;people probably won't even be wanting these until Phase 3 when BG's come out
---
PvE server I'm guessing? That's unfortunate, since Stronghold Gauntlets are basically mandatory for melee classes in PvP so they can keep Crusader on their big epic 2 hander.
---
A 32 mage asked me(27 reso druid) to help him kill mor'ladim(35 elite). Went in, didn't clear any of the mobs around him, aggroed them all while trying to kite around then got mad when we died and kicked me out of a group that was only us 2. Some people are just dumb.
---
Haha basically :)
---
The extra attack can crit. Even with just the base 5% crit, an extra attack that can crit 5% of the time is better than just 1 attack that crits.
---
I mean, yeah. Maraudon, for example, drops the Inventor's Focal Sword which is pre-BIS. Or the Maraudon quest Corruption of Earth and Seed, which has a good quest reward in the Resurgence Rod.
---
Dungeon GRINDING can be efficient - but I'm not endlessly spamming dungeons. I'm mostly doing it to help break up monotony of questing and making sure I get certain pieces of gear along the way. You really should do a few runs of each dungeon, even if for the quests. You'll learn a lot of mechanics in dungeons, which will make you more competent as a lock, as well. Killing quest mobs is not really a good way to prepare for raiding.
---
I mean, world pvp isn‚Äôt THAT big a thing in PVP servers until you are lvl 60
---
Everyone rolls with a Leveling build and repec‚Äôs at 60 
---
As for warrior, every pvp sever is desperate for tanks, you literally will find groups in seconds for dungeons haha there is a huge shortage! Aha 
---
If you want to warrior go for it man!
---
Oh that gives me the names of ppl there?
---
How the f did i not try that? Thx yo
---
Why is that? Do they lack something? Or are groups trying to avoid gear competition?
---
I am either really bad at rogue or people are just really bad at their classes lol. Probably both to be honest. Unless the only rogues attacking you are like.... spec'd for pvp. Which seems weird unless you are 60 &amp; they are 60 since there no honor right now anyways. Combat rogues really not that terrible. But only people who really fuck with me are casters &amp; for good reason. I guess if you ally and they undead rogues then yea... but undead rogues brain dead F tards. Can't imagine having such a bullshit pvp racial... but that's the human life I live.
---
Quickest way to get removed lol
---
I use Leatrix and put the rare elite emblem around my name (stock frame still). Because..I'm special! :X
---
I think use Weak Auras with a custom code snippet to keep track of my target's health, my health, and my power (mana/rage/energy); setup underneath my character.
---
I don't really need to track the targets debuffs because I use Threat Plates Nameplates, which registers that for me. Then for my own buffs I, again, use Weak Auras.
---
For party/raid unit frames I use Grid, but for healing I use Vuhdo. - Really just wanted a tidy unit frame for when I'm in a group/raid that doesn't take up a sizable chunk of the side of the game window.
---
...then BuffWatch keeps track of my buffs on the group members.
---
All in all, I really don't need any of the default unit frames. But it's nice to look at (again, rare elite! :D).
---
I am a well-geared 41 warrior (all the plate from RFD, all the best items from SM)  when can i expect to be able to start tanking Uldaman?  43? 44?
---
I tried to kill one in Hillsbrad, but he lured me into the range of the Alliance town guard, so I died. The dude spent the rest 30 minutes with his lvl60 buddy trying to find me and then let his buddy kill me while spamming the lol emote. I mean. You beat me the first time dude.
---
can someone pls give me the number of tanks/dps/heals you typically bring for 10/20/40 man raids?
---
This would obviously be quite hard to do, but yeah, some middle ground solution might work.
---
You can end up with difficult scenarios where one realm has really good queue times, and another has very long times (at least for one faction). Do you then make half the people on the balanced realm wait longer to help the unbalanced realm?
---
How do you put icons in chat?
---
Yeah I know they have a bad rep and everyone and there mom rolled one but honestly it doesn't have a huge factor if I could play it decent hopefully it'll outshine the rest that don't know what they are doing.
---
Where do I get this 50% discount from?
---
There are still up I believe. I just transferred off Skeram a couple days ago because of imbalance and I was horde side. While in character select screen click on store button bottom left of screen. Should have a free transfer there. Hope this helps. I went earthfury which was 50/50 last time I looked.

You can't cure stupid, but you don't have tolerate it either.
---
By that logic, anyone selling anything for more than they put into it is a scammer.
---
Yeah I think I can manage SFK. Somebody recommended suiciding to open the door and get to the stables. BFD I don't know if thats soloable or not. Been so long since I went there. Level 26 about to hit 27.
---
I mean best case there, you get 1 heal off after casting piles of wasted time, and the warrior just swaps weapons for his second interrupt. You get 1gcd and thats it.
---
Passive aggressive asshole gets rude reaction from salty kid. Good content.
---
I remember getting thanked on the forums for doing this back in the original launch, helped a horde with a mob in a cave as a druid in stv, I tanked it with my bear form.
---
Can't for the life of me remember which one but after leaving the port on the footpath it's around the first major bend up in the hill on the right side in a cave.
---
My name was Daemonmatrix and I was on the stormwind server in the guild Working as Intended at the time I think.
---
As a first time WoW player, I make a conscious choice not to let people leaving a party bother me. It does nothing for me and I choose to make the game as enjoyable for myself as possible. There is strategy around getting a group together to run something, and part of that strategy is: *Is this person going to need roll on anything I would need roll, and if they do, is it going to bother me? Is it going to bother them?*   
---
It's odd that something as simple as clear communication can be ignored, and by ignoring that you let it deconstruct a positive experience of the game. When gathering a party for something, it never hurts to say what you need and your intentions. If there's a disagreement, then take the necessary action and leave or kick. It really doesn't have to get anyone disgruntled, it's just the way it is.   
---
I've slowly accumulated a list of friends from running with random groups and adding the people that didn't mind the occasional 2 minute AFK to let the dog inside, who didn't get triggered when a wipe happens, who know dungeon strategies the best, who are great at playing their role. Some people are there for themselves, others are there right along with you. It will never change
---
undead mage on herod actually
---
Pressing X worked!
---
It's funny because those tables are even too tall for Dwarves!
---
Sure if you get the recipe quickly by chance. If you buy it for 40 or waste hours "farming" it then you are better off doing something else with your time. On my servers the recipes sold for 75 at one point and are still at 45.
---
You can't see enemy buffs directly in classic, though you can watch for the animations
---
no idea i play a mage on herod
---
Not if the lock is your brother and your the tank.
---
Dogmolester and kidmolester are both names that don't get stopped for inappropriate words. I feel like I got put on a list just for seeing what words were "okay"
---
No I don't play on these characters. They were promptly deleted.
---
Is this where we pretend to give a fuck?
---
You're spamming Sunder Armor and then it seems *you* are getting salty when **tanks** take offence to you pulling aggro?
---
You sound like you'd make a shitty PUG, honestly.
---
If you're going to tank then tank, **if you're in a group for DPS it's literally half of your job to manage your aggro.**
---
Even if I leave out immolate coa and corruption with a single wand pulls agro off voidwalker with ease. VW is exceptionally viable lower levels but once you get closer to 40 I wouldn‚Äôt even waste my time with it unless you are utilizing him for sacrifice. Mobs die fast enough where you won‚Äôt have to continually eat after every pull.
---
Friend, your art is just so damn magical. I think it's the way you play with soft, bright lights and colors that makes me feel so nostalgic - for what I don't know, but I really feel it. Do you take commissions atm?
---
For the Horde!
---
Yesterday I read that hunters are subpar in a raid setting and that people would choose shaman over a hunter, is this still true on Alliance side? I want to get into endgame content and have chosen a hunter as my main, but if I will have trouble finding a raid spot, I'm not so sure I want to to continue leveling it.
---
I also just found out that I've been playing it really wrong. I didn't know how to train new skills(not the ones you can train from the trainer) because I build a bond with the animals I tame, so this entire time I've been with my pets who just have growl. I don't want my choice in class(and really pet, because apparently it's wolf or bust) to hinder my chances at endgame content.
---
Delete this message one hour after you see it
---
I don't have any suggestions (I'm boring when I stream lol) but I wanted to say thank GOD I'm not the only one who can't stand the music in the background in most streams. It's always so loud and annoying.
---
If scamming is bannable (requires investigation) I'm sure we can also ban people for win-trading, right?
---
But maybe I'm just an optimist.
---
I play on a PvE server. You think I would put up with this grind if Horde could gank me while doing it? lol
---
The only reason to use a name like "Fakenews" is to troll about politics. You knew exactly what you were doing when you chose that name.
---
So drain tanking isn't very effective until lv 30 or so, it gets much stronger at 38 with a new rank of drain life. Before then you can either do the imp triangle, imp pulls while you strafe to the side making a triangle then you pull aggro as it reaches the imp. You are basically making the mob run around while it dies. If that's too hard or your lazy, I was lazy btw, then you can go with voidwalker tanking. This is much simpler, send in the walker while you kill. Be ready to wand a lot either way. 
---
Drain tanking is easy. You dot up the target and drain life it down while succubus beats on it. The trick is to not overheal with drain life.
---
I can‚Äôt see more than a few gold at best. Probably 7-8 is realistic.
---
I want an addon that takes me out of LFG the moment my party hits 5 members.
---
Unless it's a raid. Then people should open trade with mage.
---
drink to that?
---
Yeah but thats not gonna happen,  people will just complain and suffer.
---
My money got refunded for mine :(
---
Are all bosses fear immune?
---
What is the highest solo-able dungeon at level 60? Mauradon? Does this change for duo's? My friend and I are pally/warlock which provides a lot of resources together, if this may affect the answer.
---
2 heals for 10
---
4 heals for 20 
---
12 for 40
---
Might want to check those logs closer.
---
I wish there was a way to quickly apologize after accidentally killing the other faction.  I was farming near-by when I saw an ally completely surrounding by six mobs.   He was was a priest so he was constantly running and healing and doing whatever he could to survive.
---
I jumped in and killed three of the mob to let him know that I wasn't going after him.
---
During all the chaos, he jumped right in front of me as I was attacking another mob and I killed him instantly.
---
Whether or not if he thought I was there to kill him and the mob, I will never know. I just kneel down beside his corpse for a couple of seconds since he didn't rez yet.
---
And then I went back to farming.
---
\------
---
I was fishing when an ally Hunter that was the same level as me came running up but she was just passing by doing her quest. She ran back and forth quite a few times. We just left each other alone. We even waved at each other.
---
And then up on the bridge, I saw two Hordes Rogue coming from the other side of the river. They were right across from where I was fishing.   I said "She's nice, leave her alone."
---
They both swam over to me.   I repeated myself again.  "Just leave her be."   She noticed now that there were three of us and was hesitate about coming in our direction.  She crossed over to the other side of the river instead.
---
I stopped fishing by then and swam across the river. The two Rogues went into Stealth mode so I had no idea where they went.  I was walking toward the Ally hunter NE,  and "Wave"
---
Suddenly, she was attacked and killed by the two Rogue.   The two Rogues was level 43.   We were level 28.
---
*shrug* I guess you're just better than every warrior I've fought, man.
---
Don‚Äôt give your money to a PC company trying to silence the masses
---
ur just jelly cuz you dont get a pink sparklesaber
---
I got it recently but lets talk about the cape from strat...
---
I blame the hunter
---
I dont see how his name is offensive. Its funny. Are humorous names not allowed?
---
Thanks buddy!
---
Yeah it's nothing new, but (at least on my server) people are insanely poor and I just assumed that maybe the majority don't know how to make money efficiently. Hence why it's also an Introduction to AH as title states :)
---
Actually I've had luck with both Tailoring, Enchanting (shuffle), Alchemy and Blacksmithing which is my main inc.
---
Think I net like 10g per Arcanite Rod craft which sells at least once a day, and usually 2-3 alongside with Phantom Dancer (15g per craft), truesilver rod (1g per craft) and the engineering something Cylinder thingy (60-80s per craft)
---
Anyone who is employed and doesn't play6-8+ hours a day.
---
Only outright AoE if you are specifically in an AoE group.
---
Otherwise, you need to ask the group if it's cool and if the tank is capable so they can start with like small 2-3 mob pulls to make sure the tank can keep aggro.  If they're cool with it, you should be able to frost bolt the skulled mob and when it's like 20-30% you can AoE.  Then, keep it up but if you get aggro assess the situation--if you or someone is about to die, run back toward the tank so he can get aggro..  if you pulled just 1 let your aoe finish then run back to the tank with your frost shield on to kite a bit and the tank can grab it back then.
---
If the group is overwhelemed, you would still want for the tank to get it all under control because if you AoE you will pull all of them and just get rekt most likely.
---
There's a weird dance to learning to AoE and maintain your threat level.  So definitely just ask your tank and start small.
---
You can pretty much always AoE the easy mobs like the ones that rush at the end of SM armory.  Or if your group has 3 mobs and 2 are 50% health and one is on the tank you are pretty safe (and it would actually be really helpful) to AoE as you wont catch aggro from the 2 that are not being focused.  So watch out and see how well your group is at focusing down single targets too.  If they're all attacking different targets and not working together then AoE your heart away.
---
Aap sucks really bad on classic. Guidelime is way better
---
I definitely miss the talent tree system from when the... whatever it‚Äôs called now where you have 3 talents to choose from every 15 levels or so, and you can change them on the fly, same with glyphs, I think glyphing was ok though for at least the minor slots since it added some flavor to your character like turning into a deer instead of a sabertooth tiger for Druid.
---
Let‚Äôs not. Saw it on my first run and lost the roll. I‚Äôm scarred.
---
Its a quest reward from SM so as soon as you can grab the quest (maybe 35?) then you just find a group to clear SM Armory and Cath
---
Going completely solo like soloing dungs later on can mages or locks do it more easier/faster? Or both kinda neck and neck?
---
The worlds so entitled and sensitive... bunch of soggy twatters.  Freedom of speech is a joke and and equality means pussys prevail.
---
Well I mean we're technically on "1.13" SOOOOOOOOOO
---
True I‚Äôm not sure about Execute. Other abilities are still relevant though
---
Llab is not.
---
Link doesn‚Äôt work
---
I also wanted to originally play a warrior but was turned off by the numerous posts (and videos!) outlining that Warriors were not made for the casual player nor did they provide a smooth leveling experience. I made a Warlock instead and got it to level 15 before I said damn it, I'm not happy and I want to play a Warrior! So I did. I'm only level 46 atm but I have to say the whole 'warrior is terrible to level' feels more like a meme than actuality to me. I only have first-aid (not cooking) and I really dont feel like its slow or painful at all. THAT BEING SAID, its all I know.  Im sure other classes are easier to level. But in and of itself, I have no regrets making a warrior at all thus far. The point of this post is to say you should play warrior if you want to play warrior, most likely youll have a blast with it if that's where your heart is.
---
The only reason I can think of is that most of the tanks do this poorly. Optimally skipping through everything assumes that the rest of the team is also playing optimally. One small misstep by a dps/healer can wipe the raid by accidentally pulling. 
---
Mitigating the potential for a 10 minute wipe + rebuff, is sometimes better than saving 30 seconds clearing a pack.
---
Deselect filters and move selection to gray item.
---
Casual means ‚ÄúPlays less than me‚Äù and no-lifer means ‚ÄúPlays more than me‚Äù
---
meaning for everyone overall.
---
If it's a case where 3 mobs spawn, like in Loch Modan, trying to tag them and only getting one or two, means all of you have to wait all over again and hope you get the missing ones before they do and then *more* people show up...
---
Do you guys not have hand-held pocketable screenshot devices?

That would use the first slot in your default backpack. Bags are numbered 0-4 left to right and bag slots are 1-whatever left to right top to bottom

Or you can use `/use roasted quail` and it will use the first one it can find (left to right top to bottom) but you have to update it whenever you switch foods

Not saying you can't win verse these cuz obviously we can but unless you spec'd for it and have shit planned out most classes right now and 1.12 aren't auto wins.
---
Sorry. I should have stated I am talking about two handed tanking. Which you do not need insane gear to do. As soon as I hit 60 I made the switch to twohander for 90% of pulls and it has only sped up my runs substantially.
---
yeah, savespotting is a bannable offense
---
The fact people are getting epic mounts less than 2 months after launch.....
---
A man of science.
---
&gt; Yes, but my camping is more important than others
---
Lol you sound so entitled.
---
Mining, IMO. But if you like mindless grinding a lot, skinning may be more your cuppa. I never cared for wandering around looking for nodes, myself.
---
Details absolutely shows healing threat. You need to have it installed.
---
Bloodthirst and Whirlwind are not mainhand, you can use these without having a mainhand equipped. So this:
---
&gt; Your specials require 6% with an axe in your main hand. If an axe is in your off hand you still need 9% hit
---
Is only true for abilities that require mainhand to use, but how is it for abilities that dont require mainhand? Does these go of the hit% of your mainhand or offhand weapon?
---
This is better for mana efficiency while you level, too. A bunch of small heals doesn't allow you to invoke the FSR, so one big heal then waiting again might enable you to get a couple of ticks of mana back. So this strategy is multi-beneficial. :D
---
Huh? I use steamlink on iPhone on cell service no problem.
---
HOES MAD X24
---
Well put it this way. You don't need alchemy skill to use potions unlike alot of engineering items..
---
Engi/BS is probably the best combo for PVP, however, with alchemy there are things you can create that do bring things to the table such as Free Action Potions for WSG. That being said, all of those things you can simply purchase, and with the other professions you must have them to use. In Wrath Alchemy becomes a lot more pvp friendly because you can make an infinite-use HP pot and an infinite-use mana pot.
---
Point is he‚Äôs selling on ah for less than they sell for to the vendor. Losing money in the process.
---
He just needs to keep his feet off the ground.
---
No, I just wanted to say that there are good people in classic and not just people being assholes. I've run into a lot of people giving away things for free, but only really see posts on here of people complaining about others.
---
See here for more information on multisubsets: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_combinations_with_repetition
---
...what
---
Yes. You're definitely gonna be better off saving the pattern and using it or leveling an alt to use it, than selling the pattern.
---
Yes he was perfectly polite. not sure why he deleted?
---
Ahead of the curve on the Hydraxian Waterlords than most fresh 60's too huh? :)
---
I don't do it when it's a fair fight. Only when they 3v1 me or engage when I'm at 10% health from a mob.
---
I literally just got the ring on my first run as a fury warrior. Got super lucky since 4 other people rolled on it too. 
---
Now if only I could get the HoJ to drop....
---
In my experience it's about a 25% chance someone will stay and help. Its normally " k I'm done thanks for party"
---
look, closer.
---
This is false. BGs were only cross realm for the last 4 months of vanilla. The previous 1.5 years were not.
---
To clarify you need ClassicAuraDurations AND omniCC for it to work, not one or the other, BOTH. 
---
Try deleting and reinstalling/ resetting them so you don‚Äôt have the settings messed around with and make sure you have both
---
good idea! We also couldn‚Äôt manage Baron in the hallway lol. Had to tank him in the Garr room -_-‚Äú
---
TRAITOROUS SCUM.
---
I would quest from like 47-60. There are so many quest that don‚Äôt require you to do much, or do very little, and gives tons of experience. Esp western and eastern plaguelands
---
I dont see the classic collectors
---
Laughing in Mini-Diablo
---
But very nice collection mate :)
---
Go to the auction house
---
Fair enough but with the conversation that ensued after, I'm 100% certain this person was not manipulating any bots.
---
ok somehow the changing the anchor point for the target of target worked and its now showing.
---
i still cant find the energy ticker option, you got a screenshot of the setting maybe?
---
Wrong again... what about the shadow forge? Theres not always going to be someone to pop it, majority of the time it has to be cleared, thats 15+ mobs.
---
Only downside will be having to level the SFK wolf to your level if you did not grab it around 18-19. But, just bring it with you in 5-10mans and it should catch up pretty quickly.
---
Birds of a feather flock together as they say.  Usually these people will hang out with other people that tolerate their attitudes.
---
Oh snap. I didn‚Äôt even realize it. Thanks!
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll pst you tonight!
---
I‚Äôm pretty active posting on this sub so I try to insure my toon and reddit account aren‚Äôt associated.
---
I'm all for contend creators getting rewarded for their effort, but when you sacrifice the actual quality of the content by converting it to video format just so you can get your reward that's where I draw the line
---
That's a little sad then, would have loved some wholesome math tutoring story. Maybe he didn't want to confuse others with his errors.
---
Good on you for explaining the whole thing so thoroughly to a stranger :)
---
Are you purposefully missing his point or are you just a moron in general?
---
For the most part its not worth the extra time you'd have to spend feeding it and it won't save all that much gold because you'll have to use more food
---
Noice
---
I'm all for fighting the good fight but man, I'm struggling to see this as a "PC company trying to silence the masses" level of reaction.
---
yikes, I think you're actually in the wrong here. sorry
---
Try explaining a 0/26/25 Shaman build lol
---
What I am saying is that the leveling experience is fine and also plenty fast. Not a bunch of GY runs from over pulling. I also grouped for some class quests for other classes (rogue, and mage).
---
It's not some horrific beat your way through mob grinding experience it's made out to be. Maybe if your only goal is 60 as soon as possible then you hate the grind, but you will hate it with any class if all you want is 60. Warrior leveling is plenty fast and not hard in my experience.
---
Kagebunshin-no-jutsu!
---
Engineering is the only profession that requires a minimum skill to fully use almost all the items it creates, thus the reason is remains so popular.  Pretty much every other profession creations, outside a few exceptions, can be bought off the AH and used immediately.
---
So while Alchemy pots and flasks will undoubtedly be huge for PVP, there is no inherent advantage in making them yourself, except the cost savings.
---
really, i kill extra of those while leveling they have such low hp/armor ,
---
edit, also this looks like wetlands environment, am i wrong?
---
I wouldn't take alchemy OVER engineering if you wanted to PvP. But alchemy would be a nice thing to have alongside engineering. Since you'll need to use potions as well as engineering items if you want to be a serious PvPer and you can save money by crafting the potions yourself.
---
You are just straight up wrong, the average player is more than capable of that. Maybe people who don‚Äôt show up to the raid with consumables are doing less, but it‚Äôs definitely possible for people to be exceeding that kind of dps with minimal preparation.
---
If you are out of combat you don't generate threat.
---
A valid point. I‚Äôm still torn!!
---
Keep in mind that anyone reserving items almost certainly has the rest of what they need from that dungeon. If you're not in the same boat, your odds of an upgrade may actually be *better* in a group that's reserving something.
---
"I kicked a beehive and got stun. Please commiserate with me."
---
Go solo RFC in Orgrimmar, the troggs in there drop a ton
---
Thanks! Besides Vanilla, WoD and Legion are actually the hardest ones to find believe it or not.
---
Valve.com has been given me a chuckle for a good ten years everytime I forget that's not Valve's site.
---
How low is the bar for humor where just saying Fake News is considered funny?
---
His name isn't really funny in any way lol
---
I need to make a good VuhDo set up guide.
---
1.) Yes, go to Spells -&gt; Misc -&gt; SmartCast and uncheck the box.
---
2.) Yes, type **Holy Light(Rank 4)** exactly like that, no spaces. (You've figured it out, I see.)
---
3.) BuffWatch is annoying... I set mine up on my mage to white out the bars if someone doesn't have a specific buff on them, but I think there's a complex way using bouquets to set up buffs such as Fear Ward. I'll have to fiddle with it to see.
---
Threat is literally the biggest limiting factor in terms of speed kills. For good guilds threat is substantially more important than survivability.
---
I‚Äôd sell my toons name in classic. 30,000G and not a copper less.
---
Kill everything from ratchet all the way into northwatch hold and repeat
---
You dont need a fast offhand explicitly as fury. In fact id say go for a slow mh/oh combo so you hit harder. A fast offhand will eat flurry stacks. Could also be a preference thing.
---
Try Ballbareing, getting hit by a gigantic ballbearing by someone bareing their balls has to kill just about anything.
---
How would you suggest a content creator generate revenue from a text based guide posted on Reddit...?
---
Congrats!
---
How many MC runs did it take?
---
While dpsing is it worth switching to battle stance after a dodge in order to overpower?
---
Yet make levelling in badlands awesome
---
You can also use it to break up dense packs. Me and two rogues managed to separate Demetria from almost all of her adds.
---
It's always trivial regardless, I was in a pug for MC, the leader explained the strat and it was killed with 0 people dying, half of us doing it for the first time.
---
No I don't pref blog styles, each format has its pros and cons, I would never read a blog on how to pick pocket farm BRD or rogue openers, those things work for video but not for blogs.
---
Sell for 80-100 now instead of 50-60 later.
---
Recently I used the word Fakenews in a sarcastic tone in a FB comment (wasn't even political).  The comment was immediately flagged as spam.  I appealed and they reposted it but changed the word "fakenews" to "ghost stories".... 
---
Strange and interesting what triggers censorship algorithms these days.
---
You don't generate threat if you are out of combat.
---
IIRC if it gets past the filter when created, Blizzard doesn't really care unless someone reports you for the name.
---
Vanilla wow I had a guild (with just me in it) called &lt;got herpes from a toilet&gt; and had it into Wrath when I quit. Got glad in S3 and S4, they didn't catch it even then. Bigger guild named &lt;mind controlled girls say yes&gt; had a forced guild name change after some forum drama and multiple reports. Big footprint = more reports.
---
However I had a friend named Condosleeza that made it to like level 30 before he got reported and had a forced name change.
---
What?  No.
---
Unless you mean "top the tank off before they pull"...which is fine.  But starting them off with a HoT on them is worse than just waiting.
---
You go girl
---
Scarlet Monastery groups are going hard and fast right now, and I think the money there can be decent. Lots of cloth in GY, and it's easy.
---
Queen Azshara would not approve
---
And questing as prot after 51 has been fine, still think I'm moving through it decently fast. It's always possible to group up too. Like at the higher levels, I've found more people willing to team up for killing quests which you can fly through just holding the threat and letting them aoe
---
Like 3 weeks ago they nerfed the exp hard on high levels in dungeons. Before at like level 28 in sm gy I was getting 130 exp per elite even with a 60 in group. After the update it was something like 40 exp. There were multiple posts and they confirmed the exp rates were way higher than intended. Even exp you gain in the world is based off of % damage you deal to the mob. 
---
The only real way I know to power level now is have a healer outside of party heal you as you kill stuff. I leveled a warrior super quick having my shaman heal it out of group.
---
As for dungeons you can have someone help you for quest sake but its pretty nerfed and not the best exp/hour
---
Easy decision. Who would win a 1v1 duel. Warlock!!!!
---
No worries man :)  
---
I appreciate your feedback doe!
---
I don‚Äôt know the answer, but maybe can clarify the question. He is talking about certain skills, not white attacks. Does heroic strike only hit with main hand so only mainhand matters? Does ww hit with one weapon or both? I have never dual wielded in classic so no idea how the skills work vs dual wielding.
---
Can't wait but don't really have high hopes after watching ST Discovery so far. If it's bad I still got the Orville at least
---
15g on Rattlegore.
---
might be worth going on wowhead to check what mobs have the highest drop rates and choosing what to farm based on that
---
Is it everyone month or every week? Imo it‚Äôs every week you don‚Äôt, coinciding with the weekly server reset
---
Maybe they could change his name
---
Oh this server mageweave is usually around 1.2g but I‚Äôve seen plenty and even sold stacks myself for about 1.5g. Runecloth is around the same. It‚Äôs been fluctuating up and down though. Either way. The tailor was making nothing off of it unless the buyer chose to tip them. So I can‚Äôt see how that would equate to a scam on any server...ever.
---
Winterfall firewater, Winterfall e'ko and rep for the transmute earth to water recipe. Sure it may not be the best gold/hour but there are plenty of reasons to farm there.
---
Pretty sure you get threat from putting renew on the tank regardless of combat
---
One does not simply walk into Blackrock Mountain....
---
This happened yesterday. Mage quest for building a staff in dustwallow marsh spawns an elite lvl40 mob you have to kill. I start the quest, the mob is spawned and then another player has higher lvl mobs spawned in for his mage quest. Those mobs decide to aggro me, and us two Mages fight but I don't make it. He apologized in Whisper, it's np, and I run back. 
---
I show up, restart it, and an alliance ?? priest who is watching decides to murder me. It's a long run back again, and when I get there there's now an alliance ?? mage hanging around. The mage points to the quest npc, but I'm not sure if her intention is to help me, especially since I've been chased by probably 12 alliance players already in the zone. 
---
Start the quest, and she shadows me to the spawn area, waits for me to do some dmg, and then unleashes hell on this poor lvl40 elite mob. Thanks mage, you made my night.
---
There are guild banks in classic?
---
Lol for what
---
Sous vide is legit
---
Yah and no one gets salty if you win a roll over them ever. I never had a mage roll a pure healing item over my holy pally because I needed on a gear upgrade and won it. That would never happen. Community is 100% perfect.
---
The community has been 99% great from my overall experience. But there are bad people everywhere even if only a few.
---
If you're gonna undercut, actually undercut. If you're undercutting by copper pieces, I'm gonna go with the more expensive option out of spite.
---
heroic strike is your rage dump when you have excess rage generation  (fury warriors at hit cap, or tanking bosses that deal high-frequency dps)
---
I don‚Äôt think any tanks appreciate someone else pulling for them, regardless of class. Sure in lower level dungeons it‚Äôs not a huge deal but it can create a whole lot of confusion when you are tanking UBRS and all the sudden someone else pulls a group of mobs.
---
ClassicCastBar - very lightweight and shows the enemy castbar including what they are casting 
---
Nugrunning - I think it‚Äôs a really great addon for enemy debufs, it puts them anywhere you want on the screen and/ or on the nameplate .... additionally, it‚Äôs greyed out on a mob your not targeting to make it more obvious if the target needs the debuff thrown on! 
---
Should also do buffs for friendly units, but not sure about the enemy
---
But the real question is..
---
OUR VICIOUS YET DELICIOUS *WHAT*?! WHAT IS IT THAT IS SO DELICIOUS THAT THEY HAVE?!
---
I don't not invite 58s because they do shit dmg, I don't invite 58s because they aggro from a mile away.
---
But whats moving in his pants region.... \*hmmm\*
---
I play a mage but i think both fucked up, the priest more so for ruining the group.
---
So you're saying this addon puts a list of nearby names and you can click on this list and it targets them for you to mark?
---
The idea as a mage is to not get hit. Your defense is kiting. You can face tank single moms once you get ice Barrier.
---
I reckon you were doing something wrong. Warlock you can just face tank.
---
I knew I forgot to do something when HoJ dropped...
---
I've memorized the dungeons, so I haven't used a map in years. My big suggestion would be to just announce to the group that you're new and haven't been here before, and someone else may take it upon themselves to lead you through. I used to use an addon that put down world markers and 'led' people through the instance that way, but another leader could mark targets so you know what pack to kill next, or even offer strategies for where to jump/etc (such as in Gnomer, things a map won't show you).
---
LOL Andy Dalton was playing Hearthstone on the sideline! The Bungles are back!
---
Yup, you cannot possibly obtain Phase 2 or later gear until they are released, and it will probably be a couple months for 2, and several months for each Phases thereafter.
---
hemo damage is based on your weapon damage, so a sword will hit harder than a dagger.
---
Really though, you should just stick with swords and open with Cheap Shot, since swapping weapons triggers a GCD
---
Yup.
---
Heroic strike if you already have 5 sunders and you are almost rage capped.. .just use it as a rage dump.
---
Cleave: Also if you're getting to be rage capped. Generally only use it if the dps in your party is so low that you've already got multiple sunders and you are still rage capped.
---
Slam: Never.
---
Leveling is plenty fast? Ok I‚Äôll bite. Compared to what class in Classic is the Warrior leveling fast? It‚Äôs all comparative, for something to be fast something else must be slower - so what is it faster than.
---
&gt; I didn't know how to train new skills
---
This will help https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php
---
&gt;Ok, sorry, rant over. I rolled a hunter and mage and I'm enjoying those two classes.
---
[Sadpepe](https://i.imgur.com/FoebjQV.jpg)
---
It's probably due to some little known copyright.
---
Good? You know that undercutting with 1 copper isn't a dick move right? You aren't rewarded some good guy or anything.
---
Is this how Cooking 1000 look like?
---
Here's what you do: just put Hunter's mark on every rogue you see.
---
WoW with voice actors reading quests would be awesome. Even if they make less quests but more epic voice actors would be good. Even diablo 2 had voices and that had to fit on 3 or 4 cd's. Its just lazy or cheapness not hiring voice acting. "Im going to party like its 999" "stay a while and listen" EPIC!
---
Honestly, why does 1.2 matter? AS only makes a difference for two things: Frenzy and PvP pushback.
---
Wolves aren't PvP pets, so you shouldn't be looking at min-maxing PvP with it. So then it's frenzy procs, but are you raiding as a BM hunter? If not, it literally makes zero difference whether it has 1.2 or 2.0 attack speed.
---
If you are already level 60 (or honestly past level 25 or so) then I wouldn't bother getting the SFK wolf, and would just get the BRS worg with 1.5 AS that already knows bite 8 howl 4 dash 3. If you are level ~20 ish, fuck it if you really wanna min max your wolf grab the SFK one, it's not like it's crazy hard to keep it leveled with you or anything.
---
The projection is real
---
Um it is the best 2h weapon for Fury warrior if you're horde. Windfury baby.
---
So really, you're saying his content as it stands isn't good enough to warrant payment, because that's a lot of additional work you're saying is necessary.. lol
---
And u cant just press a button on your keyboard?
---
HoJ is a good BiS for DPS Warr's as a Warr Tank I'd rather do Diamond flash and Mark of the Chosen personally. Managed to snag Force of Will which is ....okay for now.
---
as a fellow  blacksmith,  with stacks of these as well, if i am in If and notice (based on their gear  because people cant transmog Yeah!) a \~lvl 40 i ask if i can put them on their boots for free,  there are some nice/good people out there still,
---
r/boneappletea
---
Yes. I would advise having macros for every single ability that requires a stance change. DPS should be switching between battle/zerker all the time to use overpower, thunderclap, rend, whirlwind. Even using sunder and switching to defensive can be a benefit against highly armored enemy's.
---
Most of the time youll be in Zerker stance and only switching to battle stance for Rend (bosses usually), overpower, and charge. If your tank is a warrior, they will normally use thunderclap for aggro control. Whirlwind should be used on CD even on one target because it is off the global cooldown.
---
That's screwed up. I'm on skeram and I just sold 10 last night at 34.99 ea. The only downside of this farm is there's always competition. Is your server low or high pop?
---
For anyone else who has yet to do this quest: let the witch doctor tank it. He‚Äôs got a lot of health. Stand behind him when the wave comes, and attack his target. This way you can kill them one at a time.
---
Before I realized I could do this, I died, walked my ghost back rezzed, and he was still fighting them. I just got right back to it and finished it.
---
Bro I would very strongly consider meeting with a mental health professional that can help you manage and deal with your emotions. It‚Äôs okay to seek help.
---
The Blacklist is the stupidest shit ever. It used to be exclusively for ninja looters. Now that the non classic players have swarmed from the game they ruined (retail). Screaming "my guilt is gonna blacklist you." For anything but intentionally wiping the group multiple times, or ninja looting defeats its purpose and dilutes it to be insignificant. Even though it was hardly significant to begin with.
---
Did this get fixed? IDK where to look for classic patch notes and I don't see anything on Wowhead's news feed.
---
Pertinent information is in the centre of the screen, everything that's less relevant is on the borders. I'm GM/MT/RL of my guild, so I need to be able to quickly check on certain things (such a deaths meter). My main action bars are hidden in order to free up screen space.
---
Blacklisted. lmfao. Alright you win man.
---
Not officially. Just alt toons used for storage of gold and mats.
---
I wish I was a hit a parties
---
I had a horde help me with a named boss last night too. We communicated with emotes lol it was cute :3 I was alliance lol obviously lol
---
Damn. Talk about toxic.
---
From the looks of it, OP is using the same guide I am.  You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbRXBu1PSPA).
---
I did it as feral in feral gear when I was after the ring so it is very much possible, albeit pretty slow.
---
Not worth skilling up tailoring just because you got that pattern. It's good and will sell to a few mages/locks, but most of those will be going for archmage or void. The real market is shadow priests, who don't have an alternative until bloodvine. Still, as a rogue you're better off engineering for pvp/jumper cables in pve, and either herbalism or mining for farming.
---
Much hate.
---
It remained the same without the addons but I figured out how it works. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/RGiEM7c.png) you see my original issue. The solution is that you are supposed to look at the color of the highlight(green in this instance, [yellow here](https://i.imgur.com/yAAqOiv.png) for example.) Feel like kind of a dumbass but such is life.
---
Its worth it if you have the arms talent that lets you keep rage on stance switch.
---
I remember people doing this shit 15 years ago though
---
I'm not sure what model of Surface Pro you have, just be aware that on the 3's and 4's the fans near the USB vent out so you shouldn't be pointing a fan at that. You're better off having the fan blow down on the top of the Surface, or even just blowing air on the back of the device. The Surface can lose a lot of heat by pointing a fan at either the screen or back, significantly more than by trying to shove air inside those tiny vents.  
---
Also you could just get a tiny USB hub so you can use a mouse and fan at the same time.
---
Such butthurt.
---
All I know is Warlocks can solo DM North by themselves, I'm at work or I'd hook you up with some vids. Basically by using the ramp that leads down and the lip that goes around the whole room, you can use some pathing trickery to dot up the bosses and have them be constantly running to try to get you. It's pretty fun, and super rewarding when you get it down.
---
Edit: No fearing is even needed
---
The color of the highlight is the same as the color the text would be if it weren't highlighted
---
On a kill everything quest i can see where youre coming from.
---
If youre inviting someone to a group for a 'gather 15 of x' type quest, im really not sure its even necessary to respond.  It should be obvious.
---
Are you a Prot Pally? Why did they even take you to begin with.
---
That assumes that they are killing the same mobs that you need. It sucks when you kill a mob you need, but the other guy is fucking around and doesn‚Äôt loot it.
---
Had this happen to me as well. The guy was super angry I took "his name". Just ignore them.
---
Good job! Im level 39 and not sure if I ever get to set my foot in that raid. You know, work, family, gf that dont like the gaming side of me.. :)
---
Arcane shot should be rarely used. Rank 1 for pulling / keeping mobs or players in combat and max rank when a mob is about to die and you won‚Äôt get an aimed shot off.
---
Stood in front of WC yesterday handing out free mage water/food for about an hour....was bored and it was fun.
---
Shadow weaving only gets applied with the initial cast of SW:P, not every tick, the easiest way would be to cast rank 1 mind flay. The debuff it puts on the boss has lower prio than SW:P and will usually push itself off so you dont have to worry about overwriting other players debuffs.
---
Even though i try to build healing and prot sets (60 paladin), i generally ask if i can roll on them. You get some people that dont care and some that do. I don't want to be labeled negatively, so generally i ask. 
---
Ended up getting the healing offhand from emperor thaurassian, but losing the healing mace to the priest in that run. He was cool with me rolling, but not everyone will be as generous.
---
Kiting is the key word here though.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/warlock-dps-beginners-guide-classic-wow
---
Also no battlegrounds so world pvp is the only way to get honor.
---
That‚Äôs friends for life right there you know that dude will drop everything to help you with a quest or a kill
---
Shouldn't that person be playing Fortnite?  You know, since he's probably 8-10 years old.
---
They ran out of time to get it working at launch according to the blue reply about it.
---
That‚Äôs right. I noticed that I was able to completely level out of the rested exp on all toons easily while playing ~5 hours per day. Now that they‚Äôre all level 19 it‚Äôs getting a bit challenging to keep up! That‚Äôs what professions are for ;)
---
In Vanilla Boss Debuff Slots on raid bosses are limited. And even MindFlay Takes a debuff slot (because of the "slow aspect"), so essentially having more than 1 shadowpriest (4 possible debuff slots) results in other debuffs such as warlock curses being knocked off, and likewise your own dot's/weaving/VE would get knocked off and need to be reapplied. The 1 shadowpriest thing, is literally to make the 5 or so warlocks in the raid do more damage than it is for your own dps.  It's the same reason we tell feral druids to not do the finisher that is a dot as its generally weaker than the caster DoTs.
---
This changed once we got Vampiric Touch and its mana return, but that wasn't until BC I want to say. (or later, I don't remember). (I also forget when they increased the Debuff Limit and Reduced raid sizes, which opens up the door for shadow raiding.) (Like perhaps people will be more accepting in AQ-20 or Zul'Gurub,  to do as a shadow priest).
---
I do this when I'm putting together groups... but I'm also a warlock. I tell them to keep doing what they're doing and I'll summon them to the instance.

#For the Horde!
---
I take lower level healer and the xp is usually a good enough incentive.
---
Push to Angerforge if you have trouble finding one.
---
Why? Melee do the best damage on that fight.
---
Yes I've trained for years to acquire this level of skill
---
100% NTA
---
Agreed, although on the other hand don't undercut by like 50% item value either. Supply and demand is all well and good but let's not make prices fall any more than they're already going to.
---
I just saw a toon with this name last night! lol. If it was you, I totally laughed and did not report you. If it wasn't you, then someone else definitely had the same idea and hasn't been banned, as of last night.
---
It is worse than Spinal Reaper due to axe racial for orca, it is worse than OEB as well due to the +sword skills.
---
BRE‚Äôs selling point is armor reduction, which is irrelevant because bosses are at 0 armor without the debuff.
---
So, um, yeah.
---
&gt; So im exping, minding my own business when i see a fightning rogue from opposite side with 50% HP. Do i kill him? No, 
---
first mistake, what did you learn?
---
Very cringe.
---
I wish I was a hit anywhere..
---
hmmm no. It was simplier than that. Just the searchbar. But I really don't care the addon if I can get the same feature.
---
Depends on the situation and approach. I like to push them into using one of their defensives then disengaging. Outside of HoJ and Repent, there is no way for them to catch you. Leave combat and find them again with another opener, exhaust them of another cd, rinse and repeat. 1v1‚Äôs always dont have to be in one go.
---
My brother gets invites to dungeons while inside the very same dungeon.
---
Did exactly that.  Left party, hearthed, healer whispered me "QQ", ignored the lot.
---
I did something like that back in the day. It was just to get every totem buff in the enhancement tree though. Losing mana tide only sucks when you're in a caster group which you wouldn't want buffed totems for anyway.
---
I got my Truefaith Vestments!  Last Thursday i was up way too late because we ran 3 rounds of Strat live.  Only one orb (total!), but on the last one the pattern dropped :D
---
Saturday we ran another Strat live and got 4 orbs in about 3 packs of mobs (wtf).  I got to grab 2, and then bought/had the other stuff made that i needed.  Felt good to finally get that :)
---
Rolling priest soon, just for this.
---
I mean, gnomes have bad grammar.
---
Blizzard staff reserved names are also in the mature language name filter. (Kevin Jordan mentioned it in one of his streams)
---
Carrot on a stick can help
---
People keep saying you‚Äôll be constant broke... I havnt found that at all aha I‚Äôve bought all mine haha
---
Fucking sissy, should have killed the scumbag.
---
Don't worry about it -- take your time, explain to the group you don't know the layout, and to course-correct you if you go astray. It is OK to be learning. Most groups will be happy to have a tank who's actually sword n boarding. If people give you grief, let them know there's a game out there where RFK takes 15 minutes to complete, and they are welcome to go play that game. 
---
You'll be fine. Remember, wipe-avoidance saves more time than "go go go" mentality. When in doubt, pull creeps BACK to a safe area, use line of sight to your advantage, and ask DPS to accomodate your experience / gear level, instead of auto-pilot AOEing. If you do this, you will manage to clear every instance in the game in decent time, as long as 1 person in the group can help you out with directions.
---
Raids, yes. Dungeons? Hasent come up much as long as ya down rank a little. Not optimal but passable.
---
Yeah the whole prot spec thing was definitely something that was a huge blow to me, I absolutely hate not being able to do anything in PvP, just feel like a sitting duck who can't fight back.
---
"When will then be now?"
---
FFS they shouldn't cater for the no job no lifes. Most players are in the 40s or below.  Everybody is 15 years older than they were in vanilla. There is only a limited amount of content for classic WoW. They should spread the phases out. Let even really casual people completely farm every raid before the next one comes out. I know there's only the world boss in phase 2, but putting phase 2 out this quickly is not a good sign for the timetable that they'll release the later phases at.
---
If the the no lifes run out of stuff to do, they can level an alt or play retail.
---
edit: this comment clearly a fly-catcher for the no job no lifes who are refreshing new
---
what do you do while you wait for end game?
---
MC every tues...
---
ony every 5 days
---
You'll only see rockbiter weapon sub level 30 before they get windfury. No one is putting that much effort into watching their threat at that level and if they take a few swings it's not going to hurt at that level either. 
---
You did not understand and I stand by what I said.
---
the reason they give at the start of the video is because people are complaining they're bored already
---
if they're really delaying phase 2 because of layering lol
---
This alongside a question of how long a mob is staying alive. With 0/3 imp shadow word pain I generally have 1-2 wand hits once a mob loses SWP while a 3/3 would make it die before I need to wand.
---
This is a game, my dude. Fundamentally, a game should be fun. If you are playing the game and not experiencing fun, then you need to stop. 
---
If you're not enjoying your warrior, roll a hunter and have fun with the game. There's no reason for you to waste hundreds of hours of your free time on something that you don't like doing and has no consequences to your real life.
---
You could watch YT videos, or run with others who know the instances well and learn from them. Guilds are helpful in this regard.
---
Dang. No one is going to want to do BRD runs now.
---
Mages right now . [excited](https://imgur.com/9Nno3lD)
---
Not the response you was looking for. But I used to play warcraft 3.  All the time. I lived for the custom maps like castle fight and hero line wars ect
---
I've tried to play them recently over battle net. But im unable to log into the server
---
Anyone know if it still works. Or if there is any other war to play war3 online like the old days
---
In the Barrens.
---
the shrug emote even more-so *shrug*
---
Nope, you're free!!!!
---
At this point, I am refusing to group up for collection quests.
---
"Oh I am done, thanks for the help and while you only have 1/10 due to bad drop luck I will still leave!"
---
No thanks.
---
I think it's the perception that people always want you to tank, I was definitely happier before I specced prot, but I don't like the feeling that you HAVE to if you want to raid or do anything.
---
Just wing it dude.
---
Be more careful on your first runs and take time pulling packs, ask for cc if needed.
---
Didn't say you weren't.  Simply said if your name is safe then you have nothing to worry about and can open a ticket in regards to it.
---
Firstly, I want to apologize for my banter. I was tired and out of turn. 
---
In regards to deep prot vs fury prot, I‚Äôm not the most familiar but here‚Äôs what I do know. The number tweaks on PS are mostly wrong so the concept of tuning our fights to there‚Äôs is going to waste more brain power than it‚Äôs worth. As far as deep prot goes, I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs deep prot rn. I know people are but if you have the right gear it‚Äôs not necessary. And as far as fury prot goes, on PS people were doing it because the absurd damage dps were doing, and as long as their numbers were wrong in the first place, I don‚Äôt know why what they did matters in regards to what we do. Fury prot is a deeply gear dependent build. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone do it that wasn‚Äôt already in epics. Which is also exactly why you‚Äôre gonna people 2H prot right now instead. Fury prot is only gonna see play once we hit BWL and all bosses will be untauntable and SOME bosses will have unique aggro mechanics, requiring more creative tanking methods. That aside, if your guild isn‚Äôt 100% engineers, full flasks and elixirs competitive, I promise the min-maxing debate does not apply to you. You can tank just fine with a shield. 
---
Remember that fury prot is a solution to a lack of threat generation issue. If you‚Äôre not having one, don‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôre dps is garbage no matter what, and you‚Äôre putting extra strain on your healers that you don‚Äôt need to. Which either requires them to play even better, be even more geared, or change your raid lineup. All of which negatively affect the raid for no reason. And as an aside, people on YouTube are doing it to flex and to test. Is your guild hardcore enough to willingly be spending 3 extra hours in a raid not clearing it so you can figure the plausibility of x and y?
---
Regarding the trinket conversation (which is totally off base regarding asking about fury tanking, these should‚Äôve been two separate posts), you‚Äôre mostly right about Prestor‚Äôs. It‚Äôs mostly the same but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. 90 health, 15 fire resist, .1% chance to crit VS .4% chance to dodge. But you could have onyxia‚Äôs now. If we‚Äôre gonna factor in a BWL neck, factor in also having replaced your trinket too, since at which point you‚Äôll have access to it just as easily.
---
As far as the blood talisman equating 14.25 defense, I‚Äôm not going to even touch those numbers. Remember that not all of what defense gives matters outside of hardcore parsing. If you have shield block up you can‚Äôt get crit and you don‚Äôt need more block. So the only part that matters is the parry, dodge, and miss chance. And dodge is hardly the worst avoidance, it‚Äôs the exact same as miss, both of which are much better than block. If anything block is the worst. 
---
I get that you‚Äôre not going to find parry on necklaces but that‚Äôs not the debate. It‚Äôs not neck vs trinket. It‚Äôs this neck AND that neck, vs these trinkets AND that one. Which also has to factor in what we have access to now, verses later. What you get in BWL doesn‚Äôt matter right now and atm what we‚Äôre losing/gaining with both options is less forgiving and you‚Äôre forgetting that. 
---
Assuming you have verek‚Äôs collar and the trinket, you‚Äôre looking at 2% avoidance and 10 defense. Which otherwise could be .6% avoidance, 1% to hit, and 3.6% chance to crit with the neck and blackhand‚Äôs breath (I‚Äôm choosing breath assuming you‚Äôre using hand of justice in both build since you‚Äôre not a fan of the mark of the chosen). Between these stat lines, this is the only debate that matters right now. Is the 1.4% avoidance and 10 defense really better than 1% hit and 3.6% crit?
---
Because that came before the honor system, so it's true to vanilla, and also layering wont affect it. Rushing would be grouping 1.3 and 1.4 features instead of simply releasing a 1.3 dungeon and waiting with 1.4 stuff.
---
I mean, if he can pay id run that a few times. Still need some things out of there and if it drops, i get some gold.
---
I wish you could heal the opposing factions
---
read the announcement before you comment. This isnt phase 2. they are splitting Dire Maul separate from phase 2 and releasing it earlier.
---
It‚Äôs less about ‚Äúfaction pride‚Äù to me and more about ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a real person behind the character‚Äù
---
should allow unlock, since it reqs only DM
---
How does shadow+ spell damage gear affect damage over time spells? if i have a total of 50+ spell damage from my gears does that just add 50+ damage on top of my DoTs?
---
Also look at Uldaman. There is a decent gun and polearm.
---
If you are combat you should have improved sprint. Wait till you get stunned and use sprint to break CC
---
oh, sorry, as you were
---
I was like that but I saw a video posted on /r/wow that seemed to hit it on the nose for me.
---
Classic is grindy and is not difficult, mostly time consuming.  But once you complete the mandatory "level to 60" path, you get funneled.  Do dungeons, gear up, do raids, gear up, the end.  But outside that there's not very much direction - it's pretty much do what you want.  Grind mobs, gather herbs, accumulate a pile of gold, stealth run instances, etc.  Retail on the other hand offers 16 different ways to progress your character and many of them progress your character in different ways.  Do M+.  Do raids.  Do dailies.  Do islands.  Do events.
---
Some people like all the choices and the unending number of things to do.  Some people feel overwhelmed and want near total open-endedness.
---
Everyone's different and no one answer is right or wrong.  But maybe you like the absence of something you *have* to do.
---
Layering has nothing to do with server capacity.
---
That's like saying slicing pizza into smaller sizes allows you to feed more people off 1 pizza.
---
Same with us, easiest way to keep a blacklist is to make a discord with the other top guilds.
---
I think that's a bit harsh
---
You are probably right. I think the amount of people surprised them and the bigger servers need more time before they remove layers alltogether
---
Not really, however I think there is a stigma where people seem to just think ‚Äúlow dps = bad class‚Äù so they don‚Äôt bring them to anything.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the hate on shadow priests for dungeons. I would get straight up ignored by people or told they wanted a real dps when I was still shadow. So be prepared to deal with assholes. 
---
But shadow priests are actually quite good in dungeons. Contrary to popular belief, you don‚Äôt need to aoe everything down in dungeons for it to be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù group. I‚Äôve topped dps meters in dungeons as shadow and surprised plenty of people who thought the spec was just useless. The mana issues only really applies to longer fights like raid bosses. You also bring a lot of utility, especially on horde side being the only class that can dispel magic. If the healer is a druid, you can res which helps a ton. Shackle undead, aoe fear, silence, shadow weave if there‚Äôs a lock in the group, slows, fort buff if no priest healer, heals out of shadowform to prevent wipes. You also have VE which provides some additional group healing to help out the healer. On top of that you have mind control, one of the best abilities in the game. In dungeons like lbrs, strat live, and scholo there are some really strong humanoids to mc that have aoe abilities that do some serious damage which helps a ton.
---
0-1 are brought to raids though. It‚Äôs very rare to see more than that even in casual guilds or pugs. They are brought for shadow weave, not dps, and guilds can have a priest run PI+shadow weave as a healer just to get the debuff up.
---
Shadow priests are gods in 1v1 pvp, but honestly not great in group pvp due to your mana issues and having to switch out of shadowform to heal.
---
Tl;dr not desirable in raids or group pvp, gods in solo pvp, underrated in dungeons
---
That logic is what is wrong. It may be technically be bis but it's a completely negligible upgrade. On a dps meter it's less than 1% increase. It's game changing warriors and rogues. It's an asshat move. No matter how you slice it.
---
As a hunter, the million dollar question now is whether or not hunter tribute runs are doable or nerfed. There are some arguments as to why it should be, in that it is too lucrative, certainly this early. But I would definitely rejoice. I rolled a hunter specifically for epic soloing!
---
I made so much money giving away spurs while leveling.
---
Every 3rd or 4th dude tosses you a gold or two.  It was really quite profitable.
---
yes, yes I am...
---
The rested accrues for 12 days, so ideally, if you are leveling 8 toons, have 4 days off mixed in and level a different toon on the other 8 nights in a rotation. OR if you like play every night, you can rotate 12 toons. This works really well on retail since there are 12 classes. But Classic only has 8 (if you stick to faction).
---
Yeah that sounds really frustrating. You probably made a good choice, if they want to play with you, they can go back to that old server again.
---
theyre still not going to be pvping for purpose though, DM wont have THAT many upgrades apart from farming gold / stocking up on mats
---
Did you look at the loot?  If so, that prob made it despawn faster.
---
and 99% of the playerbase wont lol. so ill just keep cutting by the copper
---
I think it‚Äôs fun to level a class you don‚Äôt know and randomly pick talents you think are good. Ignorance is bliss
---
How is it stopping you from enjoying the content with all the other people that aren't 60 yet?
---
As long as it's only diremaul and not the whole phase 2 then I'm ok. I don't need a big giant gankfest on both side before I get to 60.
---
No honor system. :(
---
38 - Almost there!
---
You can always spot the players who think memorizing theory makes them good lol
---
Spirit regen maximization also lets you wand more vs constantly casting so your DPS is increased as well.  All around the best way to live.
---
Arms is strictly pvp fpr a number of reasons. 2h fury is very strong and competes w DW fury on meters.
---
Arms does not compete.
---
Im not gonna type out every reason arms is awful in pve.
---
2h fury still gets points in 2h specialization in arms.
---
Rule #5.
---
It‚Äôs like 40AP extra on the swing, which translates to 5 DPS or something like that. It‚Äôs basically nothing.
---
Nah, there will always be shitters/good folks. Throughout classic and BC I remember this happening on more than one occasion.
---
Curse of recklessness is a thing.
---
my comment stands
---
I wouldn't use it on my shaman, I prefer 2h weps.
---
I could see that being really good on a rogue or maybe fury warrior (which I don't think there are too many at that lvl).
---
Yeah we should totally wait for the people who are level 15 right now to have full tier 1 before we move forward. Great plan. We will hit phase 2 in 2021.
---
#JustWarlockThings
---
 Cool. Thank you
---
Purely out of curiosity, why would you only run 5 mans?
---
You sign up for regular WoW, and you can choose Classic or Retail from the installer. It's the same monthly fee, regardless of which WoW you want to play.
---
Not played DotA, but a lot of LoL and I still gotta give it to Overwatch.  The shitty players have the same attitudes in both but the OW players have a mic to yell slurs at you.
---
Yep.  A few deaths from pulling aggro will keep them from doing it as much!
---
I generally have to alt+tab to get into WoW rather than the Bigscreen page.   Other then that, no special setup!
---
2-3 Healers for 10 man
---
4-6 Healers for 20 man
---
6-8 Healers for 40 man
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
Because that level of competency only applies to guilds who want to build that way. 
---
My guild doesn't run that way. I am a paladin stocked in full plate gear and almost entirely +spelldmg/healing pieces (not pre-bis) blues. Everyone in the guild is of the same mindset. We are building for what we would like to be in pvp. We also don't play 6 hours a day so we generally don't have time to farm dungeons for multiple sets of gear. We are also doing fine in MC and can usually finish it in 2 days. Everyone enjoys the 2 days spent doing MC. Less time in MC just means less time enjoying the game to us.
---
It's your TUNNEL VISIONING on min/max that you rigidly apply to every one you play with that we are sick of.
---
Have that atmosphere in YOUR GUILDS. Not on these forums where we are attempting to play an RPG and we might put points in charisma instead of strength even though it would be faster to kill things faster and not talk (other RPG analogy obviously)
---
You have exactly the same chances to raid
---
In Cataclysm, spirit as a stat was so insane that on my shaman, I could spam heals for what felt like forever and never go OOM. Classic doesn't work like that, especially as a holy paladin (I don't have much experience with priest and druid, but I think it's similar). If X amount of spirit regen continues during casting (for, say, a priest), that's great, but a % of regen is NOTHING compared to 100% of combat regen. You're generally going to be better off using bigger heals and regenning in between.
---
That said, I sometimes use other spells, especially if my mana is full. I have a lower rank Holy Light that gets used to top off DPS in dungeons (or the tank if he's just not taking too much damage), and Flash of Light is great for tiny slices of damage.
---
Lately I've been keeping stacks of bandages and bandaging DPS during fights, especially warlocks, which allows them to lifetap a bit more and kill things faster (while enabling me to regen mana lol).
---
..they're already spreading the phases out though? DM isn't that much content. Like you're going to still have another 4+ months I'm betting before we even see BWL. And even then if you're a casual player you can just do your mc, then slowly move into BWL and so forth. Like you are going to be farming MC for the rest of the game, trying to add months and months onto that isn't going to change anything for the average player
---
I guess dropping alch kinda makes sense it‚Äôs only 10g ish sunk from levels and recipes, mostly made health and mana pots and sold every other herb. Better to do it now than leveling from 200 to 300...
---
I mainly just do guild runs at this point
---
why do you need a guide? Can't you just grind anywhere with similar level mobs? I've been questing in Ashenvale. Not many people in this zone so just kill everything. 
---
But as for leveling with only grinding, how do you upgrade your gear?
---
Does the vault ever have any good drops?
---
yup
---
I think the whole perception that everyone wants you to tank, and do nothing else but tank is super frustrating. I definitely enjoyed it more when I was arms spec, the expectation from my friends was I would tank, and I hate it. That's partly the reason I want to roll DPS, so I can do it without having to respec or worry if I actually want to PvP.
---
Oh, then it's really just a 1% chance to resist.  You'll have to burn a cold snap if you get that unlucky.
---
Download the Blizzard battle.net app (google it, it should be the first result) and buy a WoW subscription. A WoW subscription covers both modern and Classic WoW.
---
might as well not do batches then and release all content in order of the patch it was released in if it's that easy and it gets us a more steady stream of content.
---
they promised us layers would be gone by now, so delaying wpvp and bosses because they broke their promise how about no
---
I knew there must be more to the warrior because yeah it was so fast, thanks! Rest xp to the rescue lol :)
---
Makes me wonder, or not sure why people make note of how long it takes to kill mobs and how slow priests level
---
It's 100% next on my alt hit list, was nice to feel op af, i mean it's the only class i've felt op and yeah, i've played them all now (sort of) back at original launch i went alliance and pally was my main, so yeah all classes now, more less.
---
I am debating starting to do the same thing on opposite faction, but my understanding was that full rested comes after 10 days. 
---
Either way, the way I do it is by doing a couple quests away from the inn, hearthing and logging to a different alt for the exact same set of quests. This way I can optimize my strategy by repeating it, and I can maximize my efficiency by logging after I hearth (that way, my hearth is always up).
---
Lmao my name is drater and I haven‚Äôt had a problem
---
I feel sorry for any paladins and warlocks that just bought their regular epic mount because it would still be a while before you can get the quest one *cough* me *cough*.
---
Dire Maul actually helps casuals more then Hardcore players
---
Make sniper scope until like 280, then thorium widgets which are needed for thorium shells until 285... then make shells for guildies or others as needed from 285-300.
---
(I know it's easier said than done but I waited for deals on scope schematic (40g... seen one Saturday for 25g... and the thorium shells I got for 7g)
---
Mobs will just rotate, they are aimbots.  Vs a player you would be rotating your camera as you go through them anyway so that you are always facing, but they react slower.  That is the idea.
---
And those people will farm all they need from DM within a week and be back to square one. Catering to the most hardcore players with the release schedule isn't a great idea.
---
Just give your group a heads up before you start.  
---
Just say that you're still trying to learn how to tank in general and don't know the dungeon very well and could use some insight.
---
Most people will be more than willing to teach/show you the mechanics of a dungeon or give you a heads up on pulls. People like to feel smart / knowledgeable and this is a great way to do that.
---

---
very good leveling guide, i've been following it and am almost 60 now
---
I'm laughing too hard to come up with a better reply LOL
---
I don't think RP is for me personally, but I agree, I get caught up a lot in the whole progression thing, I was a hardcore raider in Vanilla, so trying to take things slowly is something really different.
---
I‚Äôm just looking forward to all the Compendium drama.
---
Why?! DM makes MC obselete...
---
I'm one of those no-life players ready for the next phase and even I think it's too early. They definitely shouldn't cater to us, but also not to casuals. There should be a balance imo.
---
Members of Generation Z who value speed and convenience over everything
---
i stopped playing my priest pretty much completely, but i do have very fond memories of MCing people off of boats. best is just before the cut screen crossing continents ha
---
If I can get more than vendor for an item im happy honestly if im close to an AH
---
But that assumes I want to use multiple Mind Blasts, and I don't, as I consider this mostly an excessive use of mana. At that point I am forced to drink a lot more often, which both potentially hurts my wallet if I don't have mage water, but more importantly just adds downtime where the goal is to keep moving and finish things as efficiently as possible.
---
I‚Äôm in the middle of this. I thought Alliance had a bad chain until ‚ÄúOh cool BRS!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh now UBRS side, cool!‚Äù ‚ÄúUhh, UBRS? That‚Äôs fine kinda weird though‚Äù ‚Äú.... UBRS?‚Äù Luckily I love UBRS :P
---
They shouldn't in retail wow, but they should in what is essentially a nostalgia trip for a group of players where the average age is approaching 15 years higher than it was in 2004
---
It outright says Epics and Blues
---
Wow that method would drive me NUTS! doing the same couple quests 8 times in a row... Plus keep in mind that some classes can do some quests a lot easier than others and you might want to do things a bit differently. But yeah do whatever works for you.
---
I am almost positive it is or at least was 12 days, but not 100% sure.
---
Another thing to consider is that there are MANY paths in the game to do, and you will be skipping a lot if you just take the same path on 8 toons. I would recommend at least splitting it to like 4 toons taking a path through Kalimdor Zones and 4 toons doing Eastern Kingdom Zones.

Bro you literally just said yourself that you spend 2 days doing MC. It‚Äôs not tunnel vision it‚Äôs called clear goals, if you wanna pvp you should wanna spend less time in MC and should be interested in how you can make that happen. As a healing paladin as well, you must want to be confident enough in your dps that you won‚Äôt OOM during the fight. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre in a guild that‚Äôs not really focused on raiding and that‚Äôs fine, but at the same time, spending 2 days of your week on that, if you wanna really pvp you might need especially considering you don‚Äôt have that long to play, will be a waste once phase 2 comes out. 
---
Idk man I don‚Äôt have that much time myself that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested in smooth and quick clears with fast kills. Everyone in the raid needs to do a little bit of prep work and you can make it all much easier. Just some food for thought man.
---
Then it also does nothing for the mage so why does he get priority? 
---
If it had int then of course it would be a dick move but HP regen is a fairly universal stat. Arguably its better for a melee because they can't avoid taking damage while questing.
---
It‚Äôs actually sad tho, almost every other lock that I fight doesn‚Äôt use their kit fully.  I‚Äôve taught my rogue buddy how to beat them as well
---
killing someone 5-10 levels below you isn't really pvp, at least not in any meaningful way, it's just the higher level flexing their ego

Hi, /u/SmokeCocks

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/denjvd/why_is_the_friday_thread_still_stickied/). 
---
First I'm hearing about bosses being at 0 armor without the debuff? Is that because of uptime on SA + Annihilator debuff?
---
Right.... I see alot of people support the op here. But according the dmg meter all you did water auto attack. Your second best damage came from ret aura.... you could of used some skills..
---
No need for hyperbole.  If everyone who's 60 hit it with a pretty fast leveling time of 6 days played, that would still be averaging over 3 hours played a *day* since release.  That's a lot of time to spend on a single thing in your life daily.  There's no question this decision is catering to no-lifers.  People who are playing the game *a lot* by any reasonable metric still aren't level 60.
---
I mean completing mythic raids in retail is more achievement than anything in classic, my dude.
---
I'm not saying people aren't going to be happy. I love that people are happy. The achievement isn't anything special.
---
Yeah, unfortunately this is one of those things that didn't age well with vanilla. As a warrior main, your ultimate destiny is to tank. The only other way around this is to have a 2nd warrior toon specifically for PvP. He will never have MC gear, but honestly neither will a lot of people when phase 3 comes out.
---
If you do decide to roll hunter, know that you can prob be 60 before even phase 2 comes out. They level incredibly fast. Some people have hit 60 in 3 days as a hunter. Just go pure beast spec and you'll be flying through stuff.
---
I'd imagine you'll have a near impossible time recruiting PuGs to your guild MC run if you tell them you're using DKP or loot council so they effectively won't get any loot. 
---
Open roll seems like the only viable answer unless its a full guild run.
---
Dang. I've been grinding since launch night but haven't quite dinged 60 yet and I was glad they were going to wait for later in the year to drop P2...
---
Welp, guess I got my work cut out for me.
---
Priest was a jerk, you trade the mage while they are drinking so they can regen mana from making water while they trade. 
---
Mage was a jerk because he was douchey enough to finish drinking, get up, and still not trade. (Same as tanks who refuse to taunt when dps takes aggro off them mid pull. It's like god damn, it's a levelling dungeon, stop flexing your epeen, just because you're a tank doesn't mean you're better than the rest of the party.)
---
I would add both to my ignore list tbh.
---
If you want to take your time and enjoy a nostalgia trip that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt expect everyone to wait on you
---
Im not sure what route you're taking,  but you take a left right at beginning of instance.  Go through the shadow forge room and up the stairs.  Then you proceed to run in the top of the arena and jump in through there.  
---
You can avoid the fire elemental, you might get hit with a pat, but that's about it.  If someone pulls the 3 dwarves just to the left of the stairway leading into the arena you've got 3 mobs to kill.  The boss does take 5 minutes.  I agree with that.  That's why I think 10 minutes is more accurate.
---
IDGAF about my ‚Äúfellow seller‚Äù
---
Too soon. So many casuals not even 60 or just hit 60 &amp; now we have a dungeon that makes a lot of gear obsolete before people even had to farm it or had a chance to
---
And what difference to you does it make if other people enjoy the game differently?
---
How does it benefit you that they can't access content until you catch up?
---
So is reckoning not worth doing because of that?
---
As a tank, i dont care for shadow priest dps. Lots of drinking and they generate stupid amounts of threat making me have to work twice as hard
---
I'm a hunter, but I always like going to the area where you get the whirlwind axe and helping warriors of both sides kill the elemental
---
Well that was fucking unexpected!
---
Isn't there a hybrid spec that allows you to DPS when you want to, while still being able to tank reasonably well in 5 mans when required?
---
Personally, I LOVE tanking. LOVE it. I had a high level warrior in Vanilla, and my main now is a Feral druid, and I could tank dungeons all day long. Granted, that's assuming my group isn't composed of epic 'tards who don't follow my instructions.
---
Absolutely you did. It‚Äôs correct.
---
Using one blast per mob is fine, but what if you get a double-pull, or the mob resists, or you get ganked? Better to have that cooldown working for you, IMHO.
---
I do this sometimes too.  Sometimes they turn around and start attacking me.
---
It's hard to find specific videos back from vanilla. However, the item was never worked this way. The patch changes were as followed:
---
**[Patch 6.1.0]¬†(2015-02-24):**¬†Rebuilt into a Toy Box item. Players can channel for 30 seconds to cause those around them to dance with a 5-minute cooldown. Additionally, the effect will no longer interrupt eating or drinking.
---
*Originally lasted indefinitely so long as the user didn't move.*
---
**[Patch 7.3.5](2018-01-16):**¬†Piccolo of the Flaming Fire now only affects those that are in your party or raid group.
---
The risk is that someone else tags the mob. But if you pull it away from them, they are less able to do it.
---
I do dungeon grinding when doing regular questing is too difficult due to the number of other player on the same quest at the same time. Too frustrating getting anything done with low drop rates and fighting dozens of other people for the same mobs.
---
Some of the people I know play on servers like Garena (I think that's what its called).
---
More importantly as a priest.... mage water?
---
Do you play melee? If his weapon skill is really low, nothing will hit and nothing will show up in damage meters.
---
Not to mention sunder armor doesn‚Äôt do damage and won‚Äôt show up even if it‚Äôs hitting.
---
In that case it's 100% ok to just leave when you're done.
---
The reason behind transmog makes sense. They don't want that everybody looks the same.. buuut, why is that? Everybody get's top gear, with just a tiny time frame between green and epic gear. I was amazed back then what shiny epics existed outside of my reach, I knew I would never get them and that was ok. There was always this huge huge world I would never fully explore.
---
like you've never talked shit to anyone in game. You snitches are so vindictive and hypocritical. 
---
&gt;Aw man he talked smack in a game so im going to try and affect his fun in real life - said the nerd with no life.
---
Be ready to interrupt him. I think that's really the only thing.
---
BWL in vanilla was released in Jul 2005, 8 or 9 months after MC which was Nov 2004
---
oh shit.....  
---
they told me to but that is good info I will nottttt pass on the guildies just yet :b
---
Yes! :D
---
I didn't read your post but I'm a priest so I'm going with the mage is the asshole.
---
That‚Äôs fine but this guy runs solo, but every advertisement he requests every piece of gear for himself along with say he‚Äôs looking for strat.  He requests every scourgestone too... that‚Äôs a bit obnoxious as a solo fully pugging groups, is it not?
---
That's a large deviation
---
I‚Äôm too high for this
---
Theradras can be solo'd even in casual gear, so Blackstone ring seems appropriate. Baron cloak lol, I have no idea how that one fits casual since hes probably one of the harder dungeon bosses if you dont have a mage or lock, even if that isnt saying much.
---
Haha yes, was the general idea :D
---
It doesnt really make gear obsolete, its mostly complementary. The problem is that some caster stats simply dont exist (beyond a few anomalies) in the current non-raid dungeons, mainly spell crit and mp5. Dire Maul was the dungeon that was released to fix that, and it was released way too late in Vanilla.
---
It also has gear more suitable to PvP which doesn't really exist right now (namely dmg &amp; crit with stamina ... almost all caster gear with damage currently only has int and spirit)... so PvP gear would have made Dire maul obsolete if it was released at the same time.
---
[No.](https://i.imgur.com/ddXt0p1.jpg)
---
Booooo!  Boo, warriors, booooooooo.
---
If we are going by wow etiquette the mage is correct. The normal steps for this transactions should be the priest opens trade with the mage and that is a universal que to all mages that the person needs food/water. I mained mage for many years and that is what is expected. On the same hand now I am a warlock and with healthstones it is the same. With that being said they are both being tools and shoule just open trade..
---
There's a lot of suggestions above, let me add that as a Warrior your weapon is important and you get a huge advantage if you grind green mobs instead of yellow - your hit rate, crit rate, and they're damage to you will all greatly assist in kill speed and not needing food/bandages. This goes for most classes, but since weapon users dont get a base spell damage(mostly) like casters, weapons have a huge affect on kill speed. 
---
Grinding green mobs and quests is one of the secret OP ways to level fast, though it may not necessarily result in highest gold income. 
---
My rogue 55 now(Benediction), but around 24 there are dwarves in a pit in southern barrens that I grinded a ton of. The bristlebacks to the north of camp taurajo or west of that dwarf pit can also be decent, though some have annoying debuffs. 
---
And also very importantly - finding quiet places you can grind without interuption greatly help. Having groups clear 80% of your mobs every 5 minutes can half your grind speed, and getting harassed by the opposite faction will also slow you down a ton. 
---
Do all of that and only go back to town when you really have to(are you getting an important skill or just a new rank of hamstring? maybe wait another level or two) will help a ton. Lots of ppl get distracted in towns and waste days of gameplay by 60 fooling around with vendors/banks/AH/chat in cities and then wondering how their friend hit 60 weeks before them.
---
Honor to the Alliance, Glory to her warriors.
---
Wow I'm bleeding heavily. Thank goodness i have this stale bread to fix me right up
---
You dont get hk's for killing lowbies.
---
hmmm... found the guy who wants "slaughter"
---
Run.
---
Hide.
---
In the end it doesn't matter.
---
If you are close enough to see the edge, it is already too late.
---
Light forgive me.
---
You can play the game a lot but not be playing efficiently, which I recognize is not everyone‚Äôs goal. The point is releasing this now in no way hurts people who are not level 60 yet and gives folks who are more to do.
---
If you want to really dig into it, dire maul released before the honor system and everything else that is coming in phase 2 anyway.
---
I'm not allowed to have my desired name because for some reason no GM can agree on Siraeyou isnt allowed. 
---
Some GMs say it is because Sir is blocked and others say aeyou is too many vowels in a row which some say gets auto blocked.
---
Didnt stop me from convincing a GM on retail to name change my name to it but so far Classic GMs are unwavering.
---
I'm only lvl 40, but keep getting the urge to re roll class and faction to horde. Also there are about 5 classes I want to play and I've been continuously undecided for ages..
---
I think part of it is because Dire Maul gear isn't as good as MC/Onyxia gear (generally) so they may as well release it as soon as it's ready. Keeps the instance relevant for a longer period of time.
---
‚ÄúnO hArM DoNe‚Äù idk seems like you may have lost someone you could‚Äôve done continual business with instead of being a dick but that‚Äôs my opinion :~)
---
They are trying their best to only break rule 3 just enough that the mods don't care, but they still get to have their witch hunt. I could take these same 4 pictures and name any other guild and it would apply. Because they have stripped away all context.
---
Most of this is true and I agree. I‚Äôd just like to clarify a few points.
---
Debuff slot is currently 16 and that‚Äôs final for classic. It won‚Äôt be increased. I believe it was patch 1.8 that increased it from 8 to 16 in vanilla.
---
There‚Äôs a priority system on debuffs. You won‚Äôt be able to knock off warlock curses with something like swp or mindflay. I don‚Äôt think shadow weave will ever get knocked off either. Debuffs classified as ‚Äúvulnerabilities‚Äù have higher priority. It‚Äôs common practice to not even apply swp on boss fights because it gets knocked off easily and you will just waste mana on it. VE is a non issue because it shouldn‚Äôt even be applied on most bosses. It only affects your group so is only useful in certain situations and causes a lot of threat.
---
If you're prioritizing pve, then Dual weild Fury will be the best bet for raiding. Although arcanite reaper will be decent for dungeon farming as well as Arms PvP.
---
I would reccomend devulsaur and farming ubrs, lbrs mara and brd for 1handers.
---
Good, now kill them all!
---
I mean, if you're sub-60 or 60 but too poorly geared to get into a real run, then it *is* more rep than you otherwise would have gotten for that lockout. 
---
They shouldn't expect any takers capable of actually contributing though.
---
On my server alliance is constantly spamming
---
"U K I L L M E Y K I L L U"
---
and 
---
"NO M A D" 
---
after literally opening fire on me unprovoced.
---
I thought it was already out. I keep seeing people LFG for DM
---
Profession advice: I'm not hardcore enough to try to make millions, so should I just pick a profession that can make good gear for myself, and another profession that supports the first one?
---
You people are stupid. You think I want to go out and immerse myself around you sorts of human filth? How can you not possibly empathize with someone who despises reality? I don't understand how you can tell me to "go out and smell the roses". There are no roses. You sort are delusional and you think I'm the crazy one. I'm just a moron for playing with children and people with no sense of how bad things are.
---
It really doesn't. There are a handful of better pre-bis items from DM, not generally better than MC gear.
---
I've been having the same issue and I too found it's related to Prat.  Specifically, if someone posts a macro or Details/Recount data it freezes the game for a split second.
---
Y‚Äôall are weird. I would‚Äôve killed him and left as soon as I got the mob I needed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'd be careful, had a priest that had to restart the game because their mouseover macros stopped working; apparently this might be a bug.
---
Not possible to enjoy parts of classic WoW if they put Classic TBC out before you've cleared them.
---
Honestly I have no clue. I just tried the /sit and couldn't get it to stack no matter what I did so I gave up on the idea lol
---
Wow you know Andy Dalton? How come the bengals cant ever win anything with him?
---
pretty much everyone that want to play the game is 60 
---
i dont know what make u say most ppl are not 60 thats the opposite there is thousands of ppl already fully geared lvl 60 while the leveling zone are sometimes empty
---
/s my dude. Didn't think it was necessary.
---
Super micropenis
---
I walked up through the south intentionally to grab flight points on my way.
---
As much as I've had fun with Classic I'm really running out of things to do.
---
To be honest, I think it's a bit too early. Dire Maul was a neat catch up dungeon but the gold farm is too strong for many classes. It might mess with the economy too much
---
I actually liked the Warcraft movie. It wasn't amazing, but I thought it was fun.
---
With most modern computers it's faster to Exit Game -&gt; Exit Now then relaunch the game.
---
Duuude take it easy, no promises are broken unless you provide any proof aluding to the fact that phase 2 timing is delayed. They're only rushing out a part that they safely can (pvp and world bosses cannot due to layering)
---
Did you ask him if he minded waiting for the natural hp/mana regeneration to bring you to full between pulls?
---
Warlock is much easier for leveling due to better pet or self tanking mechanics. Properly played, they have little or no downtime.
---
In 5 mans, while Mage can normally out DPS a Warlock (since Warlock DOTs take time to do full damage and mobs are often dead way before that happens), Warlock has a ton of great utility that mages wish they had. They also have  a variety of pets that cater to different situations and hence they are more adaptable.
---
Imp: Generally best group pet due to big stamina buff, fire shield, and the fact that Imp is completely immune to damage if they don't themselves attack, so mobs or bosses with big AOE attacks don't even tickle it.
---
Voidwalker: Need an offtank? Done!
---
Succubus: Need crowd control? Done!
---
Felhunter: Need to shut down really annoying caster mobs? Done!
---
And of course, summons are simply better to have in a group over portals. Portals are nice, don't get me wrong ... but the big time sink for grouping for dungeons is the amount of time it takes for players to actually get there. As long as you and two others have arrived, you can pull the remaining two from across the planet without a worry. Food and water is fantastic, but these are consumables that can still be bought at general goods and innkeeper vendors. So the conjured food and water is really only there so the healer and mana dps can save some coin. Meanwhile, Warlocks can provide healthstones, soulstones for wipe protection, Eye of Kilrogg for scouting, a variety of curses that not only do damage, but also prevent runners, and increase damage on target,
---
Basically, Warlock is a mage with less dps and significantly more utility.
---
Not only fire mage dont take improved blizzard... single target spec doesnt take it... And far from everyone leveling use damage meters.
---
There are been multiple cases of 3 mage groups that find out none of them actually have improved blizzard so they end up failing hard... You realize like most casual filled group dont even finish dungeons?
---
Im considering leveling a fire mage just to prove my point at this point.
---
Mining and enchanting are the big ones.  Herbalism would be nice to have as well but not nearly as important as the aforementioned two.
---
Can't wait for that sweet level 55 water.
---
My experience tanking:
---
Taunt gets resisted (as is tradition)
---
Rogue blows up main target and steals threat
---
Mage AoEs rest of mobs and grabs threat on them
---
I'm the "tank" but literally nothing is hitting me.  I silently wonder why I don't just go into berserker stance and dual wield if this is how its gonna be.
---
The group passive aggressively complains about it, but not enough that I'll leave because it took them 30 minutes to find a tank in the first place.
---
I get all the plate loot anyways.
---
Oh OK, I pictured something else from your original description - thanks for clearing it up.
---
And here we see the neck beard in his natural habitat.
---
If you play enough that you already have your epic mount I think you'll be ok.
---
the class mounts look cool as fuck though
---
&gt;If this is some special nvidia thing, then I'm guessing the classic client doesn't support it.
---
Well, they do support at bunch of other games, so I had hoped, someone, somewhere, might have put together a hack for WoW.
---
Your first damaging ability is a free cast, why would you want to hold a cast that is on a cd until after the mob is 1/2 to you. MB&gt;SW:P&gt;MF&gt;MB&gt; Wand mobs usually dead really quick. You're essentially hitting for 800-1.4k (Depends on +shadow and crit) before the mob even comes to you. SW:P is instant you put on within .5 seconds of the mb and can mind flay until mb is off cd. You miss out on a big burst of damage. SW:P may tick sooner, but that mob is running at you sooner putting more damage on you sooner etc.
---
I like how he's threatening to post his moronic garbage on reddit, like we would somehow side with his toxic bullshit.
---
Uh, no.
---
Stop being a dick.
---
This. I'm playing a warrior so I can have group play all throughout the game. I don't take any crap from people who aren't genuinely interested in succeeding. So when people do weird shitty things I just sit down and wait for that CC or whatever.
---
This isn't retail, you can't just bulldoze the dungeons without strategy. Everyone needs to use that to their advantage.
---
Haha, I only poke them when they're at full hp to break the sheep early, then run off. :D
---
I was trying to do the ancient egg quest as a horde, I think around 53-54, and was stealthed trying to clear some mobs because everything was elite and the boss had 2 bodyguards when a couple level 46 gnome mages came through and stopped to drink and I unstealthed right in front of them and pointed to the mob and they clapped. Was pretty funny and we all got our quests done.
---
STV is lvl 30 - 40 area with lvls 45 - 60 camping players, it's even worse than any other solution. 
---
I'm sure you can read a book if you are e.g. on PVE server or you are horde, otherwise Barrens is lvl 10 - 30 area for horde that will be happy to kill you if they ever (and they do) come across you.
---
what does the z- and c- do?
---
Can we have this on Skeram please
---
Witch hunting is more than just blaming people without proof. It's about harassing someone for something done in game. If you start putting names everywhere, even with proof, some people will go to the extreme to make their lives (both gaming and real life) hell. It's like the streamers who get Swatted. That's a super extreme example, but no one, no matter how much of an asshole they are, deserves what some people do to "punish" bad behavior.
---
&gt; could care less
---
*Couldn't care less
---
I haven't been affected by the issue so I'm not 100% certain what the right course of action is, but I figure that'd be your first line of action. I would consider sending in your screenshots via mail though, just so you can deliver hard proof
---
300iq logic. By that logic anything anyone likes from retail should be in classic
---
I've seen some guides / videos where the OP was [pulling top DPS, in greens.](https://classicwow.live/guides/1024/shadow-priest-in-mc-mana-damage-and-things-you-should-expect-going-into-mc-phase-1)  So,  IMO, it's more of an issue of people not knowing how to play the class properly / knowing the rotation  + the massive amount of people just 'bandwagoning' and following what they see on Twitch / YouTube.
---
I got about 3 minutes into headcannoning a hunter dungeon tank build while driving one time before i snapped out of it. beefy pet, improved aspect of the monkey, distracting shot, frost traps for cc, high agil for more dodge, engineering for some stuns and such, tauren for war stomp, etc. it wouldn't work at all, but would look funny as hell.
---
Andy Dalton is a fucking beast
---
I love MC + Fort. I almost never engage in PvP.  The only time I do is after I /wait and /calm into MC to fort horde.  If they interrupt and attack me, I'll go ahead and try and kill them.
---
http://www.twitch.tv/amithinda
---
So give me some real advice instead of telling me I'm weak, please.
---
Yeah, but all the casters and healers will be running Dire Maul.
---
Well my aim is casual tanking yet still being uncrittable, so 15 in prot for shield stuff.
---
31 in Fury for soloing and running as DPS.
---
7 in Arms for parrying and being able to charge and retain some rage.
---
I honestly have no idea what you're getting at.
---
They havent nerfed maraudon, and they havent done any major changes like this, so I think it's safe to prep for solo tributes. If they were concerned about overpowered stuff in classic and wanted to put in changes, they would look at class balance first anyways.
---
For eu it was barely a month
---
I do understand you then and while i agree at lower levels it means less...those early dungeons are where you learn the mechanics (like threat) that allow you to succeed later.
---
Your approach of forcing the tank to pull aggro back after the shaman over-aggroes isn't conducive to smooth dungeon running.  It's the shammy equivalent of a mage saying "we're under 30, I'll be fine, I'm just going full out and let the tank handle it".
---
Unlike retail, threat is everyone's job in classic.
---
Even if new guild/raid team formation is going to slow down, raiders are going to quit. There will absolutely be a lot of people who realize they don't want to pay $15 a month just doing MC/Ony for the 6 months it'll take before BWL comes out. And those raid spots will need to be filled. So unless you're on a dead server or have really high standards for a guild you want to join I wouldn't be super worried.
---
Also re: pvp gear, not a hunter expert, but at least for some classes the blue PvP reward gear is extremely easy to get and pretty good for PvP. Then in phase 3 there will be good epics from battlegrounds rep.
---
Personally 10 man raids are my favorite. The size allows a lot more interaction and teamwork where every person matters. Karazhan is my favorite raid in wow.
---
It also keeps the tank/healer/dps ratio equal to that required by 5 mans.
---
Dump your gold, dm is the dungeon that inflates the shit out of economy
---
Not even. My guild is semi-hardcore and has close to 100 60s and 2 MC raid teams. We're clearing all current content in 1 night. There's not really much left to do once you do that. 
---
MC will still be there when people lagging behind in levels hit 60. In fact it'll be there all of phase 2 as we're not even getting a new raid until phase 3 BWL. I simply don't see a reason not to get more content out there to do, so guilds can do more than just one raid per week.
---
If it's BoE stuff you can have a friend help before you equip it on your other toon.
---
Other than that I don't think there is a way.
---
Not that everyone who is old knows anything about Star Trek.
---
That said, your joke aside, I keep seeing people make references to age on this sub and it gets stranger every time. There was another thread where someone made a comment basically implying "us oldies from back in the early WoW days expect X/Y/Z" when in reality, no, it's literally just that guy's preference and they for some reason can't help but point out they're old and played WoW during vanilla days.
---
Very odd trend.
---
This is exactly what I am worried about, the negative impact on the economy
---
The tank just needs to change the way he plays if he lost aggro to a rogue :) 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/MzxAlgr
---
That's a screenshot of me at lvl36 tanking in SM. 
---
Tanking in arms spec I'm always MILES ahead on the damage meters and never lose aggro, unless there are 10+ mobs and casters go crazy on the aoe dps.
---
Because they do less dmg then swords in MH without backstab
---
I mean, we're still barely a month and a half from launch. I feel like the people who go so hard they're already burning out on endgame content are going to get bored quickly and move on regardless unless Blizzard plans to have Naxx released by January
---
They are amazing for tanking as a non orc or human... They cut down on the hit needed to cap from 9% to 6%. The absolute number 1 priority for any tank is to be hit capped.
---
Also 50, as of yesterday.
---
Imagine this guy was a resto Shaman and trial status in the guild and not a raider. Read rule 1. Part of his proof is his healing meter lol.
---
The only positive for Grobbulus is that you aren't finding a lot of competition for kill quests and you don't feel crowded in those lower areas.  Westfall is so much nicer not having four other groups competing for the same 10 Defias mobs.
---
Time to farm rod of the ogre magi ad nauseum
---
Wow go play on a pve server
---
Excluding Dire Maul didn't make much sense.  It's the same thing with the level 50 class quests.  If they get released too late, most people are simply going to skip them.  Other than the warrior diamond flask, the vast majority of people will never do the level 50 class quests for any reason other than they can.  If they were in at classic release, why not give people a chance to not only do them, but potentially use the items for awhile.
---
People can bitch about the no changes shit, but Maraudon wasn't in the game in vanilla release but no one seems to care if it was released with classic.  Shit like Dire Maul and the level 50 quests aren't different.
---
Undead have a break/immunity to fear. It changes their matchup to win against priests, there‚Äôs not much you can do. It‚Äôs actually why on PServers warlocks are rare on ally side. Will of the Forsaken is extremely strong against fear and a majority of Horde are undead
---
We always leave one alive, they tell a more gruesome tale than just a pile of corpses.
---
Here's another tip for tanks. You're in demand so use that to your advantage, reserve items from dungeons where you dont need anything (orbs from strat live for example). People will be desperate enough to take you
---
Well, I mean...that's Classic WoW for you.  It's an inevitability.
---
I'm that guy who ends up doing the same thing three or four times because of different parts of the quest chain. I can't tell you how many times I've redone an earlier part of a chain just so I'll have help for the part I'm on.
---
I was thinking almost the exact same names, excepted I wanted Bungo, too.
---
&gt; More importantly as a ~~priest~~ mage.... mage water?
---
Time to charge more for water!
---
Rogues are extremely powerful. But this seems more like bad luck. He should have had a harder time hitting you then it seems like he did. And it should have been easier for you. As for tips, try to get the opener, smite+mb+swp, then shield and run away. If he catches you fear him then redo your opener. Once he's on his way back catch him with mindblast and kite until he decides to reset. Then repeat. It's not easy.
---
It's indicative of the speed at which they'll release each of the subsequent raid tiers. If they release classic TBC before people have cleared BWL or AQ or whatever, then yes of course it directly affects those people as they'll never get to experience that content properly
---
10/10
---
I was hoping for the hunter to be a ‚Äúspellcleave‚Äù mage.
---
That's pretty reasonable considering most servers only have a few players who can craft it. It was going for 1000g plus mats on Stalagg for a few weeks because only 1 person had the pattern. I know at least 2 people paid for it.
---
Just be suuuuper objective in your breakdown of why things went south. Even if you're furious.
---
Again. 1% hit can be used by any rogue hunter or warrior. 99% of a HoJ is wasted on a hunter. It's straight up greed vs what's best for the guild as a whole.
---
Oh right yea ofc.    Sorry I'm a noob ret pally 
---
Should keep my mouth shut tbf dunno what I'm talking about.
---
Probably not in the way you intend to. You can't enchant a soulbound item from one of your alts, both the enchanter and the enchantee need to be logged on at the same time.
---
You can however use ghetto heirlooms. A skinning knife enchanted with 30 Spellpower is a great way to quickly level up casters, for example.
---
Yea demo shout was hit with a threat nerf. Still invaluable in establishing aoe threat, but not what it was.
---
Its true you'll be behind if you start an alt now. Alternatively, the fact that you havent joined a raiding guild and aren't part of a team yet already tells me you're behind on that front. 
---
What I would do in this situation is apply to the guild of your choice, get on the raid team. Commit, be part of the group, show up, maybe get some loot, and add your alt to the guild and level him between raid days and rotate him out while making it clear you'll cede your spot as a dps warrior in exchange for your dps hunter.
---
Can you explain this phrase to me please
---
My fury is booming and bonus on battle shout, basically watered down 2H support dps. More threat than prot, but better tanking than fury/arms dps build. Just right for where I am atm tanking dungeons and doing quests.
---
Westfall LFG Chat about to be a shit show again.
---
I‚Äôve never played alliance but I‚Äôm sure night elves have a place
---
IMO...start with quests and arena for exp, then start targeting specific runs/bosses for the BiS drops you need.
---
Maybe figure out what vendor or AH water would cost at that level and tip a fraction of that.
---
Firstly, you probably need a break if you've been no-lifing it. Second, get the hell out of prot. You don't need it to tank 5mans, and there are generally a lot of guild spots for geared fury warriors.
---
TRAITORS
---
You can go over and do Ashenvale and depending on your level even knock out some of the higher level Darkshore quests.  I don't find Redridge too crazy except for the Elite quests over in the tower and the keep - aside from that they are all pretty straightforward.
---
Does Ashenvale appeal to you?
---
And if he was undead realize that first fear is gonna be broken asap. Which gives him plenty of time on you. Better to shield and renew at the beginning before your in combat. Helps mitigate that opening damage.
---
It‚Äôs because private servers had incorrect armor values. Yes these debuff along withock curse bring a boss down to 0 armor.
---
Offer your tanking services in Strath for the small cost of the first righteous orb that drops. Easy and consistent money.
---
I use recount
---
I have had to wait for mobs a bit in my 15-30 trip but a lot of the times im killing a mob and 2 more spawn on my ass. Dynamic spawn rates work and i love it
---
Agreed. I personally can't imagine a word unrelated to Star Trek being used by someone who doesn't idolize a character who says the word a lot.
---
I don't think that suprises anyone at this point
---
When youre on the bnet app be sure to select "wow classic" on the screen. The default is the current expansion which is a lot larger of a file.
---
Wait what?  they've announced a release date for Phase 2?
---
The only thing that's been officially announced is, "Later this year".  And that Phase 2 will most certainly, NOT, go live until layering is removed on all servers.  This info is from an interview with Blizards Game director Ion Hazzikostas, with PC Gamer that occurred just a few days ago.
---
They wont until the majority of reddit figures out what you are talking about, then the bitching will start full force on here and the forums.
---
I probably should have explained better what issue i am having right now, i am a rogue i just got itemrack addon and i set everything up made a key for sword+dagger(mh and oh) and another for dagger+sword (mh and oh) so now i want to attack a mob i want to start of with ambush once i started of with ambush i want to switch my dagger (mh)  to sword that is on (oh) at this point when i do this right now it wont switch my swords until the fight is over is there a way for me to make them switch riggt after i did my opener?
---
As a PvP mage, I havent even hit 60 and pretty much stopped playing my mage because DM was the main place for even half decent PvP gear. I don't want to spend 5 hours a day running dungeons for int and spirit upgrades that mean nothing to me.
---
You have to understand that classic wow is predominantly a nostalgia trip for people who are maybe 15 years older than they were, and now have jobs and families.
---
What is appropriate for cutting edge retail wow, is not appropriate for a nostalgia trip where this is a finite amount of content that will ever be released. With a probable hard cutoff of classic TBC.
---
The cutting edge is retail wow raids. Anyone who runs out of content in classic should play retail or roll an alt.
---
This is nothing but a good thing. If you aren't 60 yet you have even more to look forward to. People who are 60 have likely already beaten MC and Onyxia, in either pugs or guilds. They don't have that much reason to go into DM if they're decked out in raid gear, and the longer they wait the less relevant DM is going to be. In original Vanilla no one (or maybe a few, I'm not sure) had beaten MC by the time DM came, so it was still relevant. A large portion of the player base have killed Rag at this point though.
---
This changes that, and makes DM stay relevant for longer. On top of that, it will help with P2 queue times since now the only reason for people to log in during P2 launch is the PvP and world bosses.
---
Back in original WoW EU got the game a few months after release in the US so we pretty much had DM etc on release.
---
Here`s another example. While I was leveling, I could invite pretty much anyone my level and expect him to be a good player. Expect him to know how not to face pull stuff, expect him to buff properly and DPS his fair share. Now that the casuals have started to show up, im realizing I have to filter more and more because there are more and more people who have NO IDEA what theyre doing and end up wiping groups MULTIPLE times.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to report if they start talking about rape. Learn how to act and you won‚Äôt get in trouble.
---
As a mage, you will want to run Arena a lot until you get the caster belt with hit. Arena runs can be done starting level 51, at least that's what my guild has been doing.
---
Modified roll system, where the more weeks an individual (guild member or pug) goes without winning any upgrades, the more they get to add to their roll. Use a spreadsheet to track, bonus does not get added if a player passes on any upgrades in a run. Main Spec over Off Spec, with a loot list detailing which specs/classes each item is considered main spec for. Limit of 1 item per player, unless all players who are main spec for an item have won loot already.
---
You forgot Blackrock Depths. 
---
And yes, it does count as an endgame dungeon, considering how much BIS loot and important quests are crammed into there.
---
holy shit thats cruel.
---
It was bad enough as a horde. Last Friday there were still 4 people camping spawns at 6 am. I almost decided to quit that quest.
---
Is this horde or alliance? If you're horde, i'm sorry.
---
Please explain with exact numbers what High and Full means, so that we can have some context as to the non-shitpost meaning of your post.
---
Im hitting 40 today.  Need about 50g
---
Cross-faction friendliness is always a memorable time
---
Couple weeks ago I was doin' the yeti hide quest in Hillsbrad on my Rogue when I saw there was an Orc Rogue also doing the quest. She was there for awhile cause that drop rate is abysmal so we "grouped" up for the quest. I would pull one, we kill it together, then she'd pull one, we'd kill it together, and repeat. Kept at it until she emoted and started heading towards the exit to let me know she got the hides (or whatever the Horde version of the quest asks for).
---
&gt;the content release timeline is vanilla-like 100%. DM was released 1 month after the EU release, great news.
---
Blizzard isn't European, there's a reason they release a 60 dungeon 5 months after launch
---
Dire Maul isn't going to help that much.  The people that got to 60 and geared in a month and a half are going to finish Dire Maul in a day or two.
---
Lol imagine going through life this lazily. Just read ffs
---
Seems like they decreased the realm cap lately.
---
Good points! I think I'll keep going for now, see how it goes. Can't wait for BG's to come out.
---
Alright I‚Äôll start picking up quests. Thank you for the info. Sounds like arena is pretty essential to do as a mage for the belt
---
If you can‚Äôt be fucked to even do your merching without an automated add on you ARE a petulant child...
---
Exactly. People who are going hard are going to be bored as hell regardless of how much you put out. 
---
If you‚Äôre bored, go level your alt during this phase.
---
Going out on a limb here...you don‚Äôt have a full-time job, do you?
---
If he isnt putting down time and effort into getting a core raid group together, then he needs to say that his guild is casual. We ran a 15 man onyxia last week and pur GM PUGed an alt run on MC for some non core raiders and only stopped at geodon for time. 
---
I think it's fair to say the ability to do it is there, your GM isnt putting in the effort and you should look into applying for a serious raiding guild. Unless you don the mantle of raid leader and form a core group
---
Gl and HAVE FUN!
---
I pay repairs, i spend money on reagents to buff (20s/hr and/or every wipe), i often use potions when things get hairy (along with demonic runes that are shitty to farm as a healer), etc.
---
you must be alliance
---
horde are all violent
---
Each item is assigned a gold amount. When you win the roll you have to buy it. The gold goes into the pot and is divided among those who didnt get loot
---
No. Speaking from experience, there is a very real difference in druid tanking threat between this meme spec and full feral. Any halfway decent dps in a 60 dungeon can immediately tell the difference on the first pull without having to look at your buff bar.
---
For some reason, I've never been creeped out by video game spiders, but IRL I have pretty bad arachophobia..
---
I think having a sword and magic to blast the darned things might add to the safety. Only time spider really got me in WoW was when I had camera behind me near ground and one of them buggers walked right in front of the camera.
---
They hate losing, it doesn't matter what the loss is it burns them horribly. Same type of player over levels and min/maxes things like deadmines.
---
You are leveling wrong. We are suposed to do lower quest. Go do green quest and you'll go through without having to eat. Bandage after you killed a few packs. I leveled too many warriors to know yellow mobs are time consuming. Also you'll have more fun ganking oposite faction since they are also lower.
---
Play smart have more fun
---
1. Type /who warlock Badland
---
2. Msg warlocks "paying 50s if you port me to you."
---
3. Run to flight path.
---
Yeah, it is a ridiculous statement, which is why it was unfair to assess the situation as though that's what OP was thinking. That's why the dude needed calling out.
---
My bad I didnt read your post well. Yeah this method is probably the best. I can understand why OP wants to get his dots ticking asap but he should adjust to this
---
I think it's just the prot aspect of it I don't like atm. I think I just need to respec him into arms or fury for a while.
---
He's fat irl so don't feel too bad OP.
---
Any good summary of the dire maul content? Is it one dungeon or multiple? What level requirements are there
---
I've yet to have had the mana regen delay from the warlock mount ever screw me over. What situations are you in where the 5 second GCD is causing issues?  
---
I can't recall one time in all the years I've played where I thought, "If only I used a regular mount to move here."
---
Making a lot of people butt hurt, but I think this is fine. Dire Maul came out before the PvP patch, so this gives people the ability to go to Dire Maul and not get ganked by 5 man PvP squads.
---
MC is already a joke (my guild cleared it with 23 people) so I don't see how adding DM is an issue as long as they're still delaying phase 2 with PvP until later this year.
---
&gt; The losing faction stops queueing and the winning faction can never get BGs
---
Yep with the current faction populations, horde on most pvp servers would be waiting an hour for a queue pop. As they deserve. so I agree with OP, there shouldn't be cross realm bgs
---
Be nice, they announced  DM dates.
---
Very weird to think you‚Äôre causing some sort of epic meltdown when horde probably just dropped a bunch of ‚Äúalliance being losers in stv, anyone wanna pvp?‚Äù in trade and guild chats
---
Im Horde
---
it's why I use a KoS list
---
horde are 10x more aggro than alliance and its tempting to go murder horde after one attempts to screw you over, and they always do
---
but everyone is a different person, so I just hunt down ppl on the KoS lists lol
---
why?
---
you weren't soon enough
---
Have you seen the streamer posts? ;)
---
maybe im not looking good enough but is Scholo and Strat runs not that popular for some reason? it seems like most people want to do LBRS/UBRS mainly.
---
i never played vanilla so i dont know alot about what dungons people like but thats what it feels like im seeing atleast
---
Why? It‚Äôs just as likely they always intended to launch phase 2 later but decided there was no harm in releasing DM sooner.
---
But he was right, he was going on Reddit. Not in the manner that he expected though.
---
&gt;And nobody is speccing shatter before 60 because everyone specs for blizzard AOE.
---
You're assuming literally every player is doing the most dead-head boring "meta" leveling strategy and that is absolutely false. Anyone who wants to do that boring shit for 100 hours, knock yourself out, you know the build you need. People who actually play the game spec shatter because it is indispensable for questing.
---
And 6% of your mount is practically nothing when a mage doing nothing special should easily have 100+ gold by 40. Like I said, I threw almost half a mount worth into a dumpster fire (trying to corner a market and failing) and still had enough at 40 for mount, riding training, lvl 40 skills, and portals. I got nothing fancy, no big drops, didn't level tailoring quick enough to get in on really profitable bags. Sold the herbs I got while questing at market value. Auctioned decent greens and then vendored if they didn't sell after 1 trip on the AH.
---
For the boomers with 5 kids who only play 4 hours a week maybe. 
---
Sorry we're leaving you behind grandpa.
---
They announced today that Dire Maul is next week. The rest of phase 2 is later this year.
---
Yeah, you _REALLY_ need to get lucky with timing on that quest. Come at the wrong time and there's five level 41-42 Horde (or Alliance in your case) who will kill you if your name even shows for a single frame, come at the best time and there's usually only one Horde(/Alliance) and maybe one Alliance(/Horde), and neither will paticularly bother you much.
---
Please spend some time looking at this resource.  https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
So you'd have no problem with Blizzard releasing Naxx right now?
---
As a 60 Lock who leveled mostly the same way, the shadoweave set is more than sufficient to last into your 50s. I'd strongly suggest the Dreamweave set as you can easily wear these until you replace them with your pre-raid BiS. I farmed the Skullsplitters in STV for a few hours and was able to walk away with enough Wildvine (plus extra) to make the set. You will get enough silver and greens to sell to cover the remaining mats.
---
Can confirm this. Using bite you get your pet's focus to full right before things comes off cooldown, meaning you can growl again.
---
Do whatever makes you happy while you play. It‚Äôs a game. It is for fun.
---
I think people will manage lol
---
As an herbalist/alchemist having a faster mount speed is a HUGE blessing when herb farming
---
You understand what a small minority your guild is right?
---
The downside to releasing more content is the gear gap pushes the majority of the player base away because they feel they can't compete in pvp.
---
What else is coming out with Phase 2? I thought that Dire Maul and PvP systems were the only things coming out in phase 2
---
Come to Incendius brah
---
'FROM NOW ON YOUR NAME IS PRIVATE SNOWBALL!!!!!'
---
Sure let‚Äôs print money into the economy faster than ever. 
---
Why do we even have phases if we‚Äôre going to have DM already and put the BWL gear (1.6 loot) into MC from start AND use 1.12 itemization?
---
Lack of integrity in your version of vanilla world of Warcraft blizz.
---
that hate between players even of the same faction is kinda sad.
---
Awww you are adorable :D I wub you too friend
---
I think diremaul is fine. Looking forward to it., They already announced p2 end of 2019 btw
---
I follow a 1:3 ratio. Every time I get ganked I then must gank 3 horde. If it was by a hunter I also need to kill 6 hunter pets (but stun the hunter and run away /cackle qt their dead pet. Bonus: camp the pet and dont let them res)
---
November 23 to March 7th. So 3.5 months.
---
They want me to MT&lt; the problem is, the wait for them to start raiding is draining, I don't even know if it will happen at this point.
---
Dude, you are not a semi-hardcore guild. You are a hardcore guild...
---
To have that many people already clearing MC is clearly a hardcore raiding guild.
---
What is healing as a shaman like? Is it difficult? What stats do I want to focus on?
---
Read the video?
---
Imagine thinking not watching a video makes me lazy?  Now browsing Reddit while I'm suppose to be working....
---
Multiple cases.. out of what.. millions upon millions of groups being formed per day? 
---
This is a non-point mate.
---
The very fact you‚Äôre trying to bake in yet another assumption - that ‚Äúcasual filled groups‚Äù don‚Äôt utilize such things as damage/ability meters...
---
Just laughable.
---
What‚Äôs even more laughable is that much of all this can, and IS, mitigated by the group asking prospective mages what their spec is.
---
I‚Äôm chalking this up to another Reddit circular argument syndrome case.
---
You‚Äôre digging in so deep at this point it‚Äôs not worth it to keep up. Good luck lol
---
Very true! Thanks :)
---
Hum anyone notice lag spikes with loot/rolling as well? Ive been trying to determine which addon was causing it, maybe it's prat?
---
It usually happens in dungeons but takes a few hours to start occurring.
---
Funny thing is, most people i talk to complain about "world pvp". The game design for world pvp is non existing in vanilla (and later expansions). I am only on a pvp server because thats where the good raiders mostly are these days (as well as my friends).
---
Nah. Top dps will almost always be a guild member who's already gotten gear. That just funnels more gear into guild. No offense but I dont see anyone puging with you using that rule.
---
I'ts Blizz doing Blizz shit.
---
It's the whole reason why WoW turned into the shitfest that Retail is!
---
Blizz listen to the stupid 10% minority that rushes content and wants more more more...
---
I'd guess Thanksgiving, but I'm just a random guy on the internet.
---
Just keep killing mobs and vendoring items. Fastest way I know of as it you dont have to train a profession or deal with undercutters on the ah
---
Again, and I can't stress this enough...the point of the post is that the guy didn't know who Captain Picard was. Not that his name was not a Star Trek reference. Just to really head that off at the pass before we go down a rabbit hole arguing about whether Engage is more strongly associated with Picard or with something else--it's irrelevant. 
---
so i mean, you might not have thought to message them to say 'hey is your name a reference'
---
but op did
---
and i wasn't nitpicking, I was trying to demonstrate how it being a character's catchphrase might perk your ears up a little more than it just being a broad concept from the show.
---
i guess you meant the shoulders, yes, they does, on 2-3 runs you should get em.
---
Oh I do dungeons all the time with friends and guildies and people I've met, I just mean I don't get unsolicited invites like the OPs pic on my realm.
---
ignore them back the moment u see they ignored you lol
---
What's funny about it is how inconsequential being "blacklisted" actually is.  I've had multiple people say they are blacklisting me(usually for rolling on caster loot as a healer even though it was also my bis) and I have never been denied a group.
---
In a raid they are literally the same difficulty.
---
You do the exact same things.
---
I'd rather someone undercut me by 1c and maintain the overall price for the item we're both trying to sell than tank it.
---
I had this alliance rogue in feralas I was desperately trying to MC + fort. He sees me casting so he stealths and opens on me. So I kill him. Wait for him to spawn and I /wait then /hug and try it again. Same thing, he thinks I'm being aggressive and camping him. This happens a third time, but the fourth time I finally manage to buff him. Then he just sat there for a while, I'm assuming totally confused, finally he does /thank and stealths away. 
---
But maybe 100 yards away I see him unstealth and start killing a mob only for a warrior to come flying in and smash him. 
---
Oh well, life goes on, and so I rode away.
---
When is phase 2 (or the next phase) starting?
---
I‚Äôm mining/skinning and keep hearing that the money isn‚Äôt really that great in skinning. I‚Äôm only 110 and lvl 23. Is it a good idea to drop it and go with something else? 
---
Or at this point should I level it until 60 and then drop it for something like eng?
---
How can it be 'too soon' though? What possible negative impact could there be doing it now vs a month from now?
---
We know there will be a positive impact because a pretty big chunk of the playerbase is 60 and will get to enjoy this content. For anyone not 60, it's another cool dungeon to look forward to.
---
what lvl were you? this mob has only around 3k hp, shouldnt this be relatively easy for 3 players? i think i almost soloed it with my 29 priest the other day.
---
Fortunately 3 rogues can trio Angerforge (or 2 good ones).
---
Well, dire maul is out next week. So even less incentive to spend money on a Warden staff now.
---
Where do you guys find those stats
---
Here is the thing I think that was lost along the way in vanilla about PVP servers.
---
They are servers that have PVE and PVP. It's about strategy. If I can convince a group of people to leave the horde/alliance in the area alone and we just start questing with no issue, we all win. I don't really care if the opposing faction might also be winning at that given time.   
---
Saturday in Tanaris at the pirate cove there had to be a good dozen horde and alliance both hitting up everything. In walks this stupid 44 mage and his 40-46 group and they start a war.   
---
With in 10 mins, there were level 60 horde there camping the place for a good 45 mins.   
---
When I presented this mistake in general, the typical responses of "go to the pve server noob"  
---
When in reality, those who started the fight are the amateurs and honestly don't understand pvp.
---
Okay i will keep an extra one, but is there something i can do so it switches them back to my sword+dagger without having to wait till the entire fight is over?
---
This is... Too soon, seriously... Especially since, come on --- you made me buy the epic mount as a warlock because I expected to  get use out of it for months before DM came out, now I actually feel kind of cheated.
---
Yeah this is way too soon and probably will hurt the player base. I'd be astonished if more than 25% of the entire player base is even zoned to raids
---
Probably doesnt exist. But youre also not useful when youre dead. Reckoning is only useful in dungeons, the end.
---
Did you slay him afterwards?
---
They absolutely should be rushing through Phases 1 and 2. The sooner the honor system, battlegrounds and BWL hit the better. The first two especially, as they give level 60s far more to be working on.
---
They can slow down a bit after that.
---
Yes. It was like max 15k concurrent players now it is 10k or even less.
---
More likely their raid frame bugged out and the macro worked fine...
---
Mouseover macros are bulletproof. It is usually a raid frame bug if anything...
---
That is the thing about it being objective, it doesnt matter who says it because its just true.
---
I wasn't advertising in trade, I was posting 11 wildvines on the AH and happened to notice someone wanting to buy them in trade.
---
A quick interaction:
---
"What are you paying?"
---
The guy responded by telling me what he wanted them for, not what he was paying, although that'd be my fault for not using proper english in my original response, I guess. Then he asked me for an offer (and I was expecting one from him) so I gave him 10% off of the AH buy now price. Seemed fair to me? His response was too low, so I told him that I'll just AH them, and put a smiley so he'd know no hard feelings.
---
According to the wave of downvote posts, putting a smiley makes me a passive aggressive douchebag, who knew?
---
Ignoring me before I could respond to the last message, well, that's not cool, but whatever man, find your wildvine somewhere else, I guess?
---
So you're saying that the game is just dead a month after Naxx drops? Plenty of people say they want to play classic forever, which presumably means they want to play years on complete classic with everything out.
---
I made this point elsewhere. I've never, in all the years I've played, ever had an issue with the mount using a GCD lol. Most others seem to agree.  
---
I'm curious as to why you are experience problems with it.
---
It's almost as if they stated that nothing has a set date and they are watching the players to judge the best times to release phases. Who wouldda thunk it?
---
world pvp and mining
---
Post proof then. None of this heresay
---
i dont think it matters at all for stores in real life. if you are already physically at walmart, you arent going to travel to target to check their prices and then go back to walmart if they are 1 penny cheaper. you are just gonna go to whatever store is closer and buy what you need no questions asked
---
At this point I feel pretty sure (just a feeling) they'll drop 1 BG with Phase 2. Locking all of them away makes no sense anyway, especially since Alterac or Warsong could help empty out the cluttered world a bit.
---
Only buy spells and only those you use. never buy gear. Go herbalist and skinning. Lvl 30 go STV and get PTSD.
---
I hate reserves. Sure if I‚Äôm running for mask of the unforgiven I‚Äôll try to avoid picking up melee dps but I‚Äôll never call first orb.
---
Boomers are ages 56+. There's essentially no boomers actually playing WoW.
---
Stop using a term if the way you are using it means nothing.
---
Nope.
---
If you group up with a much higher level toon (or even if you don't group up, but your friend is doing all the damage), then your XP per kill is miniscule. I'd say that the fastest way to level is to team up with same level mages and do some massive AOE pulls.
---
and always go for your epic mount first on any fresh, fuck all the crafts and boes. Get your mount
---
The entire game starts over. Everybody back to level 1.
---
I, a level 42 orc warrior tried to help a 43 human warrior similarly. Except when I charged the elite after him the first thing he did was intimidating shout me away so we both died...
---
As a new player, what does ?? mean?
---
The style of PvP made famous by DrakeDog is to Seduce and then throw Curse of Elements (no damage, just makes them take more) and a nice, big, slow, Soul Fire on them. Unless you are leveling with Emberstorm, not the best way to handle it.
---
To fight a Rogue, the best way is to do something similar, but **strafe** away a bit, cast CoS during the run, and cast Shadow Bolt (sideways) instead of Soul Fire at about 5-6 seconds in (Seduce lasts 10 seconds.). You then buffer Fear in at the end of the Sbolt cast and get the Fear off before he can Kick it. You then throw another Sbolt out. Death Coil and another Sbolt with instant-cast Corruption buffered in at the end. You're basically doing what Rogues do to you, locking them down and murdering them.
---
It was barely over a month after launch in EU, and somehow the sky didn't fall down and it didn't utterly kill WoW forever over here. 
---
And this isn't retail where older content becomes obsolete the nanosecond a new raid tier comes out, people are going to have progressively more to do with every phase release, especially when we have the honor system and BGs which is essentially endless content for most.
---
Only the finest of water will flow through my bones and decaying husk of a corpse.
---
Nobody said it is.
---
Right? We had idea what could be bad about it Lol
---
Dude needs a fucking Xanax. It‚Äôs literally a video game god damn
---
Every hunter/lock are going to farm the shit out of tribute for 100g/hr raw gold, anyone who can aoe will be living in east doing lasher/dogs/thorium mining/herbing for high raw gold and mats as well
---
Holy shit, I've been watching pokemon since I was in grade school. I have children who are the same age as i was when I first started watching pokemon. And to this very moment I never realized Ekans was snake backwards.
---
People can use ignore for whatever they want.

It‚Äôs funny how upset people get. Who cares if someone ignores you.

**&lt;Rusty Ranch Raiders&gt; \[A\] \[PVE\] \[NA\] Pagle**
---
***About us:***
---
Come home to the Rusty Ranch Raiders, where we like to sit on the front porch and talk about the good ol‚Äô days.  We are a Discord social group called Rusty Ranch with a large community of adult gamers of various games and platforms. Come for WoW but stay for the community of friends you will make and the adventures you will have! 
---
Most of us are older (25 ‚Äì 50) and a good number of us have families and most have jobs; so, we know that video games are not the priority and that family always comes first. Some of us are WoW Vanilla vets or TBC and WoTLK babies, and some are new to the game entirely. 
---
***Who we are looking for:***
---
\- Currently recruiting all races and classes! We are trying to build out our core membership for when it comes time to raid.  If you are still leveling, that's perfect, so are we.
---
\- Drama free, friendly, active, social, helpful, responsible, mature, leaders, patient ‚Äì Do you fit most of these key words? If yes, please contact us!
---
***What we do:***
---
Right now the focus is on leveling and building the guild. We have events from time to time for community and fun.  However, we do want to start raiding in the next few months.
---
***What we want to do:***
---
Our plans include Raids, PVP and BGs, and other group content.
---
***Raiding:***
---
\- Raid times are TBD but will most likely be in the evening time frame ‚Äì 9:30pm CST to midnight, or there about. Days are TBD but will include a weekend night (Friday or Saturday).
---
\- Must have a mic for raiding once we get to that point. 
---
\- Some other quick rules with raiding: show up on time (unless communicated beforehand), talking during the raid will be kept at a minimum, come prepared, study the fights, know your spec, and come to down a boss. This is where we will probably be at our most serious while still having fun.
---
***Leadership Opportunities:***
---
Are you interested in a leadership position? Excellent! Prove that you can lead and take initiative and you will get a leadership role; whether as a Raid Lead, the Leader of PVP Raids or BGs, and more.  Maybe you are so smart on attunements you can be the guilds Attunement Leader. Perhaps Recruitment is your thing and you‚Äôve already shot so many holes in this recruitment message that you almost feel sorry for me ‚Äì we can use you!
---
Are you organized and a planner? Want to organize guild events and come up with fun ideas? That sounds amazing and we welcome you and all your ideas.
---
***Simple rules:*** 
---
Treat others as you would want to be treated. Be respectful and mature. Angry yelling, bullying, intolerance of others, judging, etc. is not allowed. 
---
***POCs:*** 
---

---
you are just a casual.. stop complaining and go to retail yourself we needed more content in the game ive been 60 for 3 weeks
---
Phase 2 You're gonna get a pocket healer and lay big dick crits on people all day long.  How does that ever get old?
---
I really miss having this and theorycraft.
---
Both
---
no update im struggling hahaha
---
What server was this?
---
Your guild is in the top 1% that qualifies it as hardcore.
---
Generally, no.  I thought it was really strong in wrath where the HOT did not break on damage and it had a larger click radius, but in vanilla it's pure garbage.
---
Well back here in Murica, I was playing in November 2004, so 5 months before DM.
---
It's too soon.
---
\#nochanges
---
Actually it was down to 2 layers. None have had 3 for weeks now.
---
I'm a hunter and I love leading dungeons. I just tell the new tank the general direction to go and give a brief description of any special boss mechanics.
---
People worrying about (and obtaining before 60) their pre-bis barely a month into release are not semi-hardcore.  Even just being 60 at this point is almost enough to qualify you as hardcore, regardless of gear.  You might not be bleeding-edge hardcore, but you and the people you are surrounded by are definitely more hardcore than you seem to think.
---
Yeah, but you claimed he was half assing, which is not the case. Just like you spamming fireball/frost bolt and it being resisted wouldn't be half assing, you would be doing the best you could in the situation.
---
I wouldn't have gone either, but maybe he was trying to teach them a lesson when someone say no they can't do something, they mean no they can't do something and stop harassing people. But who knows.
---
The guy whispering him was an idiot though.
---
Hi, /u/howdydroopy

---
You dishonor the horde by fighting side by side with the alliance scum. Traitorous and treasonous
---
GAAAAAA-TOR-AAAAADE
---
I‚Äôm on the tail of the pack at 40 on Kirtonos, lots of alts in the 30-50 range already
---
In vanilla yeah, but it was changed later on and it was deceptively powerful, if still relatively unused and unknown.
---
Because generally most people are more worried about leveling within the first month. And yeah no I don‚Äôt expect shit for anyone. I‚Äôm the type of tank that marks every thing and macros the meaning of the marks. If I see someone like a mage farming whelps I talk to them and tell them about better spots for their level, always better to educate them. 
---
And that bastard gnome, lol I talked to him, when he told me he was doing a quest I didn‚Äôt out right confront him, I just told him about way better spots for him. And then he just kept farming the whelps.
---
Noooooo!!!  I'm not ready yet!!  I'm only 53 with only 3 BiS pieces!  I was hoping to be 60 with all BiS before Phase 2, (With DM), was released!
---
Damn it!!
---
It makes a lot of sense actually. If honor was in the game it would be impossible to level.
---
I'm with the too soon camp. I'm 60 for a week now which I think is still faster than the majority (with job, 2 kids and a wife). But unless you went instance hunting with a guild group all the time, there is so much to do in the standard dungeons. Heck even now no one wants to run LBRS, with DM out the gap will be even broader. Also with DM gold farm opening, prices will explode for the majority.
---
They should have just released in December.
---
Imo, nothing matters until there are battlegrounds.
---
I usually 2 man it with a warrior friend, we will take a mage or healer if they need the sash. I have yet to see it even drop
---
Every faction has a cloth quartermaster in respective city. Darn is by the tailor trainer. Gnomes are in Tinker Town area of IF. Farm runecloth and turn it over. Also...do as many quests as you can beforehand.
---
For me, yes, always having a mini sprint for when things get hairy is strong. Engineering has a ton of unique items and gets trinkets long before most people do. Non-pvp server makes engineering a little more questionable for the cost.
---
August 24th was only a little over a month ago. But I see enough 60s running around that I feel totally okay with giving them something else to do until the next phase.
---
Maybe they worship Light beer.
---
2 different games..
---
Don't buy anything. DON'T BUY ANYTHING. And sell everything.
---
Your family clearly does not rely on you for anything so they are ok I think :)
---
&gt; Completing Mc is more challenging than an lfr when you consider logistics and all that. Nice try at a hyperbole tho bro!
---
No, it really isn't.
---
It's common on my server every few days for a pug MC group to appear, I've joined a few and logistics/equipment has never been an issue.
---
People know what to do, they know what their roles are, and they know how to get there easily. 
---
MC is trivial at this point, the only difficulty is finding 40 people at the right time.
---
People can run it for vendor trash that sells relatively well. More gold out into the system. Assuming solo runs aren‚Äôt nerfed.
---
"Are you prepare to **serve** me, mortal!?"
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Feels like a reaction to the sub drop from tourists leaving. Not all of us have no lifed our way to bis.
---
Right I‚Äôm confused, I ran from hammerfall to kargath at 34 without dying no problem lol
---
Way too soon. Is the gam going to be don with all phases within half a year? what happens after that?
---
I was wondering if people want Classic to stay 100% Classic and never see small fixes like this. I myself would love the option to be able to use all the new art assets, textures and models while still having Classic gameplay.
---
Paladins had a taunt in BC, righteous defense, it was in many ways superior to taunt while bad in other ways.
---
He's right. For him. And classic is better for you.
---
Plus, this is in Ironforge, the DWARVEN city, so the furniture should be shorter anyway.
---
Not that I disagree because it‚Äôs important to explain how you tank which varies on builds, but if you‚Äôre specced into Furor you can Regrowth/rejuv then bear before each pull for massive AOE threat, temporary invincibility and 10 rage immediately.
---
Bears are killer dungeon tanks and around the 35+ level range for me people started noticing it
---
Just play Horde and create the PvPTSD in Redridge rather than suffer there.
---
Dm was out on euro launch. Dm was out before a large majority of vanilla players hit 60
---
I'm also on incendius. And in the same boat, had a decent sized group at the start, half quit, half level too slow. But I play all the time! Always looking for a healer. I am a GM of a small guild, but trying to grow and start prepping for a raid group, need all. So if you reading this and want to change guilds/raid with us. Let me know! Though I've joined other guild runs in the recent weekend's. Let me know if you wanna join my small guild, or just run some stuff! I play weekly from 7-11pm est ish.

60 Mage - Whudafxup - Whudafxup#11889

DM is not going to invalidate MC runs lol
---
"I proceeded to camp his corpse for 10 min after that to make sure he thinks I'm an asshole instead of an idiot."
---
I agree, been saying WSG with Honor would be my preference. I can only imagine how much it will suck to be a lower 50 person trying to level on a PVP server with an honor system and no battlegrounds.
---
How FITting to take the screenshot at night, really accentuates the orange glow. Big grats.  Such a beautiful bunch of pixels, probably my favorite weapon aesthetically.

How do you guys deal with AoE threat? i've checked guides when learning how to tank and it always says to use Demo shout then spam Battle shout, and that's all fine and dandy when everyone focuses one target but the second a mage decides to cast blizzard it all falls apart and it's extremely frustrating. is there anything we can really do in that scenario?
---
oookay... thanks for the info, I guess.
---
If you got someone playing rs over wow, they're a poor NEET.
---
I love how people refuse to participate in world pvp and then compain there's no content.  Fucking cata babies.
---
he's lost.. get a new friend
---
&gt;  or if something else came up, still in a fight, etc.
---
I mean, don't fucking roll when you're busy doing other shit lmao
---
Oh yeah I would advise you to just go level up more and come back to it when you're higher level (Winterspring is 55-60 anyways) because you will just get shit on repeatedly with no way to fight back, especially since people also tend to target those with much lower levels since 90% of the time someone there under lvl 50 is just trying to snipe and sell patterns.
---
Also I doubt this would even fall under Blizz's definition of an exploit since, despite being out of aggro range of guards, the player is still easily attackable by enemy players (unlike the Tanaris arena)
---
People are still going to run MC even when Naxx is out, so whats the point of having phases if we‚Äôre gonna rush content like this lmao?????
---
I have 0 problems with Hunters, never failed killing one. Actually find them to be one of the easiest classes to stomp for me. Crippling poison and theyll never get away. Im combat specd w imp kick and sprint while lvling, winning atleast 90%of fights 1v1
---
Exactly! My buddies who are going pretty hard but clearly not hardcore are only level 54 right now. Just by merely being 60 after the game being out for a month and a half puts you in the hardcore tier.
---
You‚Äôre arguing with the min/maxers of retail
---
It outright says "you can roll on greens"
---
Some people are just retards. I've tanked BRD maybe 20 times by now (started when I was 54, 60 now) and yesterday I got in a group with a backseat driving DPS that critiqued every single pull I did. After the 3rd "you're supposed to wait for healer mana" complaint when I pulled with healer at 60% mana, I just told him to fuck off and hearthed out. Put him on ignore and moved on. 
---
I wonder how long this dude will last before every tank on the server has him on ignore and he can't find a group.
---
Dire maul should have been in day 1 like Mara.
---
Make MH Rend/Jed reserve groups and get it within a few days to a week, easily. So, nope.
---
It's clear he's joking
---
WAY TOO EARLY 
---
MOST PLAYERS ARENT EVEN 60 YET 
---
WTF
---
they got light thaught by their human friends
---
DM releases a week from tomorrow, recent announcement
---
Sure, i only reserve if I tank and organize the group, that way people can decide whether or not they want to join my group. If I tank strat live there's no gear for me in there so I need to get gold somehow. At the end of the day people need tanks so I use that to my advantage, even if it makes me look greedy. Tanks suck at gold farming so we should use our class and role to our advantage, by tanking and reserving in dungeons.
---
But that isn't a "haha just kidding" moment.
---
He literally told a joke lmao...
---
My birthday. Yay!
---
Warlocks in general are probably a most new-player friendly class in the entire game right now:
---
* Easy rotation to learn with opportunity to excel when mastered
---
* Pocket tank for tough mobs
---
* Super sustainable, little downtime when played correctly
---
* Great tools to survive and thrive in World PVP
---
* Free mount at 40 saves a ton of gold while leveling
---
* Always desired/wanted for pugs due to good damage, healthstones, and summons.
---
* Super easy rotation for raiding at 60
---
You madman!
---
15-87
---
Working theory is because it was removed for a few patches and added back in with the 1.10 loot overhaul we may not get it until then
---
Really hoping that its just super bad luck though
---
So because the people who never leave their house plowed through content to get BIS gear and already have raids on farm, the rest of the game is going to be rushed?
---
Great.
---
Real men play OSRS and WoW at the same time.
---
5/23/23 Spellhunter checking in
---
Are you talking as a healer or dps?
---
Anyone that actually takes ranking seriously has been farming gold since week 1 for that purpose. They won't be farming a single penny when phase 2 hits. A rogue from APES who has gotten rank 14 multiple times said that when going for rank 14 on a competetive server, expect to spend 1k gold per week on consumes. That's 1k gold per week for 5 months, meaning a minimum of 22K gold that you need to farm before phase 2 hits. Also, if you're part of the un'goro mafia, it isn't odd if you earn several hundred gold per hour farming devilsaur, at least at the start of classic when we had so many layers.
---
Honor system in phase 2.. AV and WSG in phase 3.
---
Nice reading comprehension, you missed the important part:
---
&gt;**at the right time.**
---
The only hard part is finding a group of 40 people during off peak hours, takes like 30m-1hr during regular times.
---
And this is nothing new.
---
Everyone who has played the endgame knows how easy it is.
---
Taking a long time != difficult.
---
Who says wow is hard and isn't conflating hard with tedious or grindy?
---
I mute it too, even though it's actually used exclusively for LFG, but it scrolls by so fast that the chat window becomes unusable for anything else.
---
See but now we are talking about .1% of guilds which still would be over doing it to be farming that many consumables now as p6 is far far far away.
---
Why play a pvp server if the pvp is ‚Äúthankfully‚Äù taken away from you?
---
enchanting just for disenchanting or?
---
I dont think blizzard gives a single shit about archeage
---
Jump runs?  Care to elaborate?
---
Nice moving of the goal posts there.
---
Yeah, in which case just don't make such a huge error. It even has a confirmation box telling you it will bind it to you lol.
---
The trick is Swifty's macro
---
/castsequence reset=10 Sweeping Strikes, Berserker Stance, Berserker Rage, Whirlwind, Battle Stance, Thunder Clap
---
It's insane!
---
I also macroed charge with bloodrage for a nice amount of rage on the pull. Then spam the macro until you see Thunder clap (the last skill in the sequence) then I switch to defensive stance and use demo shout and start sundering everything if i'm taking a lot of damage or spam cleave if i'm not.
---
It's more because without voice chat a lot of activities become painful.
---
I remember 40 man raids with just chat....oh boy.
---
and that is how TBC was born...
---
"Wow... it would be sooo cool if we could fly..." - the entire Vanilla community 2006.
---
Ah ah. Pally tanks built right are incredible AoE farmers. Course I believe that's once you hit 60 and can gear correctly.
---
Very nice! Human Rogue here - I always help hordies when I am out adventuring, never attack first. No point in being a douche on a fresh server where everyone are trying to level up ASAP and there's no honor system.
---
Sometimes I don't get this friendliness back but it's ok! Although I had something very frustrating happen to me one time in Shimmering Flats - I saw two hordes pull too many mobs, I went there to help them and they barely made it out alive. They didn't do anything, just walked away. 15 minutes later I pulled 2-3 buzzards at once as I was happy to see buzzards alive, all of them in the whole zone were dead. Those hordes ganked me while I fight the buzzards and killed me. After that I respawned and camped them until they released at the spirit healer. That was the only time I just couldn't be nice to hordes. A few other times hordes attacked me straight up while I was helping other hordes who were friendly. Most of these times undead rogues/mage attack me. It seems like my favorite race (undead) are the biggest douches lol.
---
Holy shit, you can‚Äôt even understand my argument. The item to get those is a special item, NOT THE SHOULDERS THAT DO LITTLE HEALING. 
---
So the Mage not knowing about a secret item is stupid? I didn‚Äôt know how to get these and I‚Äôve been interested in this game since Beta. Knowing everything because you read it off of a website is different then YOU finding it. 
---
Well considering you didn;t understand my explanation AT ALL and came up with a WORSE QUESTION. I say to YOU, I can teach.
---
There's really not much you can do against a skilled undead rogue with their CDs available. 
---
Add a Free Action Potion and /or a Restorative Potion and undead rogues are extremely powerful in 1v1 against all casters.
---
Furor and improved enrage can get you 20 rage at the start of e very pull. Something warriors cant do. (at least that im aware of)
---
Although I do agree building aggro first as a tank is important.
---
RS combat system is literally click and AFK. 
---
Skills are just a grind to get anything done.
---
Quest design is superior to WoW, but WoW is better in every other aspect
---
Warlocks/Priests maybe, Mages no.
---
Hey im actually on the quest to kill that spider, can you kindly hold him there for now while i head over?
---
Very casual players?
---
What's your definition of very casual? Less than 5 hours per day?
---
Coming here straight from mythic palace blows my mind
---
Just had to deal with a paladin tank in strat that literally did not know how to pull, he had to have the group do it for him every time. He DI‚Äôd the healer one pull because they got to half health or something and that resulted in a wipe. The group died before baron, it‚Äôs amazing how the most simple mechanics are rocket science for so much of this game
---
Honestly I think it‚Äôs because a lot of people from RuneScape came over
---
This. Warlocks are easy pickings when you silence the shadow tree.
---
It was ready at release. Everything was ready at release. The phases are just arbitrary divisions to give us a classic experience.
---
üòç
---
Not quite sure what you are talking about but it sounds like a nice thing and has a lot of upvotes so have one more!
---
I think it could also work, the thing is, the more parried attacks you get, the more you can spam it thanks to your rage being refunded.
---
Never tried to use hamstring for that.
---
I just listed all the reasons ive been put on ignore lol but sure my bad üôÑ
---
I'd agree if it were BWL but DM?  Nah.  Should have just been there on launch IMO.
---
What?
---
thats only the case for healing pallies. tank pallies NEED to wear plate for the highest armor value possible even if it doesnt have int on it. a tank wearing cloth will take like twice as much damage
---
You figured it out fam, i'll make sure to play Classic WoW "smarter" next time and make only "objectively" smart decisions. Fucking moron.
---
Yeah my alt is definitely going to be a druid.
---
‚ÄúOh noes, we might as well scrap MC and keep only the bosses that give good loot, let‚Äôs just have Naxx out right now even though im a level 15 plebian cuz daddy blizz said so more content = more good haHAA‚Äù
---
this is some r/ChoosingBeggars shit
---
Same boat as you
---
&gt;but often times these Paladins don't have a side spec
---
Then I guess they're finding another group (or you if they were there first).
---
Define "common sense" in the context of OP's post, seriously. Is it really common sense for someone to use their profession to make a dungeon run more profitable for them than for the rest of the group?
---
I don't. But, it causes less PvP on my PvE server, and less PvP overall is good for me because PvP is bad for the game.
---
&gt; This population will continue to get bored quicker as the phases and stuff go on.
---
It's almost like Classic isn't that great of a designed game and the hype was indeed almost exclusively fueled by nostalgia.
---
HoTs don't stack in Classic!
---
I just go pvp or farm consumables for phase 2 when i get bored. Have a ton of thorium nades, sapper charges, major healing/mana pots, tubers, night dragons breath, restorative potions, andbother random shit like really sticky glue and slumber sand sitting in my bank.
---
When phase 2 hits, Ill be the biggest consumable whore around.
---
ya wasn't thinking lol. will own this guy
---
Flurry procs matter more for slower weapons. I have like 1% hit chance, so dual weild is painful.
---
I still quest usually with dual weild though, as I have a mirahs song with crusader and thrash blade.
---
I just don't need to be competitive on any dps right now.
---
Yeah. They eventually want some plate cause they would fucking eat ass in pvp. It is so funny to see a male dwarf in a dress when they could go full plate lol
---
Nice! I just hit 60 as well! 
---
The top Prios to me are:
---
1: Find a guild if you haven‚Äôt already. Vanilla is about progressing together and now is when it starts.
---
2: Get your attunements done. By the time they‚Äôre done you‚Äôll be close if not already ready for MC/Ony. Ony attunement is really long, MC is really short
---
3: once those are done either gold farm for pre-raid or epic mount or professions OR you can target the remaining pre-raid pieces you need for your spec. 
---
Best of luck! I‚Äôm right there with you
---
OSRS is alright but:
---
Way too repetitive motion, Gp is literally anything you can just sit and make money doing the same shit and get full gear no skill required. PVM is literally just playerflicking and moving, game has immense delay if you think spellbatching is bad you need to see OSRS,  game is solo player experience there's hardly any group elements to it at all.
---
I mean what do u want to accomplish? Just pick a goal and work towards it, dungeon for pre raid BiS, farm gold for 60 mount? Go gank lower lvls of the opposite faction? Theres so much to do just pick a goal and go
---
YES! Im fine if they rush phase 1 and 2 so they can get BGs out already...iv been waiting and waiting to relive AV!
---
Imagine reading before posting... It is literally described in the OP
---
I was hoping DM was pushed back until sometime next year, we are not at buffed XP gains to be progression.
---
As other people have said; that rule is about gear. BoEs or crafting mats are greed. They can be as much of value to you as anybody else.
---
bis items
---
Honestly, while I've seen a few bad apples, the majority of players I've encountered have generally been quite nice to deal with.
---
That being said, I see one possible issue with the above: All these examples are from top tier players. People who are already level 60, especially those who have been there a while, are generally those who play A LOT and who's life kind of revolves around the game. Often times, these people tend to be pretty anal and overreactive since they feel their time investment entitles them to special treatment. Lower level, more casual players tend to be much more relaxed and sociable.
---
I'm proud of you if it makes you feel better :)
---
That is super cool!  Thank you for sharing that!
---
DM will last you a few days tops. Then what? Release BWL and 2 weeks later AQ?
---
Content can never keep up with players, that's how it is. Either you find your own fun otherwise or... you don't and just play something else.
---
If you're enjoying your time why does this even bother you?
---
You buy a stock and someone basically checks the price faster than you. Buys it and sells it to you before your order hits the exchange. They even bait you. They put 1 cheap one to see your order hit. Then fill the remainder at another exchange.
---
They said "before the end of the year" so I'd guess November or December
---
It's part of a recent meme where one of the stereotypes is the 30-year old Boomer, which kind of correlates to the WoW classic demographic of "dad gamers" that came back to the game.
---
They don't even have to unignore. You can message people you have on ignore.
---
Most people are mid 50s. Tons of people are doing MC at 55. It's not that early for a large portion of the playerbase.
---
The responses I have seen from GMs say they will not swap them out. GL though
---
Honestly I could care less if it comes out early, but it should be the honor system with world bosses first instead. They should probably pair DM and BWL. Not having the honor system out makes there absolutely nothing to do but grind instances and wait for raid day, DM doesn't change that much.
---
I needed this, thank you.
---
How? You literally just form 2 groups and then the boss in a triangle, have melee shoot bows and chill, and whichever group he teleports into moves to where he teleported from
---
It‚Äôs some of the most basic mechanics of any boss fight in the history of the game, the only time you should ever even take damage is immediately after he teleports into your group and even then it‚Äôs a trivial amount
---
54 myself, i'll be honest I thought i'd be 60 in like a week or two, but here I am.
---
Should read ‚ÄúUR‚Äù
---
I have never unsatisfactory why people put the same bid/bo price.
---
Just found that out! Thanks for clarifying!
---
you get the same confirm when you hit greed, which is my normal response. Just gonna be passing from now on. No confirm for a pass.
---
People will push engineering because of the small benefit that you can get with Iron Grenades, Sapper Charges, and the boots/helm (to a lesser extent).  It takes a lot of practice to use them effectively.  Depending on your class, the viability can tend to break down.  If you aren't getting targetted a lot, sapper charges aren't helpful.  Iron grenades take time to aim and throw.  Do you have free global cooldowns and time to use them?
---
If you have Alchemy, you'll have the benefit of more potions at your disposal for minimal cost.  You can afford to have elixirs up and health/mana pots ready at all times.  It takes a serious gold income to be able to afford that and engineering (if you aren't farming the lowbie mats yourself).
---
My advice is to play what you enjoy.  The benefit of engineering is minor compared to how much of a pain it is to re-level a profession (especially if you have rare recipes learned).  I'm tailoring/enchanting and will stay that way.  I will be participating in pvp quite a bit but to drop all this work for a small boost isn't worth it to me.  Being able to make my own cloth items, make money from enchantments, and never need to find an enchanter for a rare formula is value enough.
---
Definitely don't expect something when I'm trying to die.
---
No there's not a general consensus on it, else you wouldn't have this issue would you?
---
You're ninjaing cash in this situation,. BOEs are worth the exact same as their gold equivalent. You basically decided that your need for cash was greater than everyone else's need for cash. You saving money by getting essences is just as valuable as the other people getting value from selling essences. That's ninajing.
---
True, strange things had 8.
---
If you had said 8-12 instead of 3-10 I wouldn't have even responded, but "3-10" implies it's at least semi-often as low as 3 which is something I literally haven't seen before. I'm also more used to shows like The 100 which have in the ballpark of 15 episode seasons (though I agree I wouldn't complain about that being more like 25).
---
fuckin GOTTEM
---
That's exactly the situation though. I think a few ignores on you are probably warranted.
---
What are the loot rules? is your aim to clear MC?
---
You really don‚Äôt need to be prot for anything in phase one
---
I guarantee that the amount of people entering MC with world buffs after Oct 15 will be higher than 1 in 1000.  It is going to be much more common than you are positing.
---
I noticed when opening bags with bagon addon there was a minor stutter aswell. Switched to Inventorian and its gone.
---
shit this is too fast i want classic to last
---
That is not DKP then. That is loot council
---
Which is why I said **at the right time**.
---
If you try find one at off peak hours you are going to struggle, I've been in runs that take 30m-1hr to get 40 people and ready for MC during peak hours.
---
OP doesn't mention anything about peak hours. 
---
I have no idea why you're so salty over the idea that MC is easy, people have been pugging this for years without any issue, you just need to try it at a time when lots of players are on.
---
you welcome this because you have no life
---
But clearly you are retarded
---
Another warrior and I helped each other with the berserker stance quest. It was actually really funny. I helped him first and when I charged in he kinda strafed away aground 2 other mobs. When he realized I was helping him and not trying to kill him he and I killed them all together. Then he stayed and helped me. I wish I remembered his name now.
---
Yeah I'm all for BGs sooner rather than later. But it will probably be a while
---
/question
---
You forgot sprint and free action pots.
---
If you aren't main tanking Molten Core, there is no real reason to be Prot.
---
&gt; There are only a handful of people with that rank, and they are just friends of the guild leader.
---
100% confirm this is true.
---
"quests"
---
"questS"
---
it's literally one quest
---
Also, having a quest that you can do at level 36 and then have to wait ~8 more levels to complete the next part of it is not good design.
---
Wouldn't the actual damage from shield slam factor in?
---
From now on casters, hunters and healers(except priest without robe) can't need on my righterous orbs in stratlive, OP told me so :)
---
No, meaning they only specifically state epics and blues are on reserve. They also explicitly state you can roll on greens. Legendaries aren't mentioned at all, meaning any rule on the fly that they state if it happens isn't against any explicit rule they created at the beginning of the run, and isn't reportable.  
---
This is a frankly bizarre arguement to have considering we probably both consider this a dick move and wouldn't be a part of that shitshow either way.
---
Classic wow is crashing on player activity, not that hard to figure out.
---
More than half of the people I started out with barely logs on anymore.
---
Disregarding PvP, DM is the primary content of Phase 2.  I wanted to be 60 with all BiS, prior to DM, (Phase 2).
---
I suppose but it dosent have the same meme value
---
Touche
---
Yes i have a job, house, car, none of which i or almost all of the people i played with had back then.
---
People are 15 years older than they were, though of course there will be some younger ppl who never played 1st time around
---
Also dungeons are ridiculously faster in modern wow, so for someone new to classic it might seem like the efficient option here too
---
You're not the only one alive. There's a rogue afk in the corner.
---
And two weeks after that you‚Äôll be bored again.  The problem might not be on Blizzard‚Äôs end...
---
How does this ruin the game for people who aren‚Äôt 60? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to take it away in a month.
---
none of the quests are race specific. any race can go to ashenvale. and night elves can go to redridge
---
Oh, neat. Thanks!
---
I off spec tank as a Warrior, from a DPS standpoint I prefer Warriors &gt; Druids &gt; Paladins for tanking
---
Dungeon grind as arms or fury on the way up.  Stuff doesn't hit hard enough for it to matter - all that matters is that you hold threat, and you won't be quite so gimped solo.  Just make sure you have macros to equip your sword and shield  - like, add equipslot 16/17 to shield bash and shield block macros.
---
Nobody recommends prot until you're ready for BRD.
---
LOL /Point.  Cute story bro
---
How early is too early though? Do we really want open world PvP chaos for 3 months? If they stagger it by a month and a half like they're doing with DM I think that'd be perfect.
---
I‚Äôll that as a ‚Äúno‚Äù
---
Diction* crazy how autocorrect can correct to a different word, happy now that you googled what diction is?
---
What criticism am I not accepting?
---
I used to get frustrated by it but now I embrace it. My job on big AoE packs is not to tank everything the whole time: my job is to help control the chaos.
---
To pull (assuming I‚Äôm not LoS pulling), I do this:
---
Berserker rage &gt; battle stance &gt; charge &gt; defensive stance &gt; blood rage &gt; demoralizing shout &gt; sunder skull &gt; then cycle sunders and revenges throughout the pack. Sometimes I just concussive blow skull if I think it‚Äôs going to die in the stun.
---
My group usually lets me get at least the first Sunder off before starting to AoE. They WILL rip threat off me, and that‚Äôs okay. They‚Äôre slowed in the blizzard. This is where I start controlling the chaos. One mob is further ahead than the others and getting close to the mage? Taunt it and let it walk slowly back to you during the duration of the taunt, then it starts walking back to the mage. The whole time it‚Äôs not doing damage. More mobs leading the AoE pack? Try to stun with revenge, or concussive blow. Attempt to take back aggro just for a second to get them back into the cluster.
---
Two good friends of mine play Warlock and Mage, so I‚Äôm very comfortable with a heavy AoE group. Remember that you are not failing your job by losing aggro, just try to direct the traffic.
---
Where, the shaman.
---
Unless, now stay with me, you actually enjoy playing the game.
---
Did most people leave Stalagg?
---
So realistically we are looking at classic only lasting a year and a half?
---
Have you tried opening a ticket and explaining? They might let you refund it.
---
Even as a dps warrior my damage is still great in dungeons. Definitely not as good as a tank in some cases, but if I can land that initial hit and get sweeping strikes going it‚Äôs gravy
---
When people say pservers were 'overtuned', what does that mean explicitly?
---
Right but it's also a matter of convenience. Some people would prefer a 900g mount with no convenience cost.
---
Saw a "BallsackJizz" the other day...
---
Not sure how that got by.
---
You're as much of an idiot as the rager in the image above. He was correctly spending what little rage he was getting on sunder armor and taunt, neither of which show up on damage meter.
---
is there another site which breaks down levels of active players?
---
I played vanilla incredibly casually, never made it to max level. So this is basically my first time playing through classic. Overall im glad theyre releasing it sooner rather than later, but part of me is a little worried that it might make some of the other dungeons obsolete?
---
&gt; DM gives better loot than MC.
---
for some select classes
---
for mine there are 2 items out of DM that are better then what is currently available, and the difference is negligible
---
But community man.
---
Yes, I‚Äôd say the game release schedule shouldn‚Äôt be based on a minority that has unlimited free time
---
My hotkeys are located right where weapon rolls popup. This can really hurt me if it happens midfight and my abilities get covered up. Is there anyway or addon that will let me change where that window is located? I know I could move my abilities, but generally like where they are.
---
Why are you on this sub if you really think RuneScape content is actually more challenging and has deeper content fucking lol
---
Do you have a link to this build please?
---
I had completely forgot about that one.
---
I‚Äôd say hamstring would work better since it costs less rage.
---
Pretty much other than Barrens/STV, general is either absolutely dead or just a few people looking to group up for questing. The only real spammy channel I've found is LookingForGroup. After the same dude copy and pastes LFM SM GY AOE FAST CLEAR ten times in a row every 30 seconds, even I'm tempted to mute it lol
---
I tried this it wont let me switch until the fight is over
---
He most likely used this guide https://youtu.be/IbRXBu1PSPA by the looks of it.
---
HoTs don‚Äôt even go up to 1 stack in classic since healers are forbidden from using them :)
---
That's fair, it probably is more widespread than my comment implies.
---
Are there any items with the stat, "increases crit chance of healing spells by 1%" or something similar? I know there are plenty of items for increasing crit chance of melee items.
---
I always tanked vanilla through wotlk. Leveling a warrior sucks, but is the most accepted tank class. I just leveled a priest for classic, but wish I had gone druid instead. Guilds are learning that bear tanks are actually viable if spec'd/geared right. They can manage big damage better than warriors. You can level by tanking in dungeons while also having viable dps in cat form, while healing yourself between mobs. At 60, you can decide to tank or heal based on the guild you meet and their needs. You won't be stuck as having to tank or having to heal. While paladin can say the same thing, unfortunately they aren't as accepted for anything other than holy yet. They shined in BC more.
---
You  might be right, I only considered online players.
---
Priest and warlock have a lot less synergy than it looks like on the surface. In fact, I'd say they're parasitic on each other instead.
---
While the shadow weaving ability is definitely a synergy, it comes along pretty deep in the shadow tree; and you really should be avoiding most of the shadow tree until post 40 anyway in favor of disc. Outside of SW, there's no synergies between the two classes other than priest being able to provide a heal.
---
The biggest issue is last hitting. Priests and warlocks are the *only two classes in the game* that really care about getting last hits, and both of them use it to fuel their zero-downtime grinding. Warlocks, with imp. drain soul, and priests with spirit tap, will be cannibalizing each other's last hits and only experience half the benefit of each. These are two of the most important talents for both classes' efficient grinding builds.
---
The other issue is that SPriest generates too much threat for the VW to tank, so the priest is gonna be face tanking everything; and then the warlock is based on DoTs to do damage... So the only way to be more efficient than just solo grinding is to be stacking multi-pulls and throwing DoTs on everything, which isn't a particularly good way of AoE grinding. It's just a kinda clunky, unbalanced duo without many synergies.
---
Tanking really isn't hard and I prefer it because other than keeping an eye on the healer's mana, you get to set the pace for the dungeon group.  DPSing is fun for BIGNUMBERS but I actually prefer tanking because people are so sloppy with picking up adds
---
If you going to strat UD anyway why not add the xbow from there?
---
Where did he say that?
---
I don't understand why somebody wouldn't just group up with you to help out with your quest. It's more beneficial to them to not complete for quiet mobs. Sure, they maybe lose out on a tiny bit of xp per individual mob, but overall it's a net gain. I just don't understand this thinking process. When I was grinding as a mage I always grouped up when I could. It's just easier.
---
Advice on what? Quit focusing all your mental energy on video games and go get a job. Leave your comfort zone you've been handed to stay in and put yourself in the real world.
---
Demo shout's threat is negligible to non-existent in Classic. It will not pull a mob away from a DPS who pulls. The only AoE taunt that is available is on a 10 min cd. The higher threat was added in a later build of WoW.   
---
It would be better to use your rage to tab Rend on all your sundered targets as well, and when I DPS for other warriors (I am a tank), they are also wasting their only "Oh Shit" button aka Taunt instead of saving it for when a target actually changes from them. Once we see more Warriors in Prot skill trees near end game, you will realize how much Shield Slam does for threat, and how that should be mainly used during rotation.
---
He made a counter offer to yours. You‚Äôre the asshole here OP, not the other guy.
---
Yeah! Should work with both on default :) I haven‚Äôt touched them.
---
Not sure about making them bigger 
---
Weakauras will do that for sure! But it‚Äôs complicated and hard to set up, you can copy other peoples but often need some tweaking for what you specifically want 
---
Good luck :)
---
I'm specced prot and been running spellcleaces since 40 man. It's not about holding threat it's about the cc you get from deep prot. 
---
Your basicly pretending to hold threat while stunning and taunting mobs that run away from the aoe pack, it's a whole different style of tanking all together. But ya if your tanking you should be specced prot unless your wearing twink gear/raid gear.
---
That's not how that works. The honor system gave negative honor for killing players more than 10 lvls below you and from what I understand they will be including that. You will get ganked by high levels much much less. You should really only have to worry about people your level
---
its medium... and i had no competition farming this. I am the only one in wetlands doing this. Mind you, this is on a EST North America PvP server. I don't get it... deviate cooked fish is selling for only 1.50-2 gold 20 stacks. Yet copper ore on my server can sell for up to 35 silver per stack this is all horde side.
---
I'm considering transferring to another server since I can't seem to make any money even with greens. Everyone sells everything for dirt cheap on my server. Black Lotus just one of them sells for 20 gold. A 20x stack of stormscale eel is selling for 5 gold. I have 3 20x stacks of these and I don't want to sell them for that low of a price.
---
Nothing is stopping you from doing this. More end game content being added does not negate the pre-60 content.
---
I played Vanilla. I‚Äôm now 29. I have a 60 with about 50% pre-BiS and I‚Äôm working on my second character now. Not everyone is playing the game for the same reasons.
---
If your making a weapon switch macro youll want to use the macro system ingame and use the equip slots 16 and 17.
---
16 is MH and 17 is OF. Its faster and wont trigger an extra GCD.
---
The majority of the player base is below 60? Based on what metrics have you derived this information?
---
Duplicate items going into the ah will just not rise in price as steeply.
---
Pretty sure this isn‚Äôt true.
---
You were saying that content releasing more quickly would make the game's 'end of life' come faster. How else could I interpret that except that you're saying the game will be dead soon after Naxx comes out.
---
Game is meant in a way that honor will be released while the majority is around 40-45, where the grind gets a lot slower and getting ranks up while grinding makes it more enjoyable. It's totally fine.
---
Dude mid 30s are brutal - Mid 40's are a walk in the park by comparison
---
Time to level the hunter and start doing some Tribute runs.
---
Well, I'm level 25 ATM, and I know aggro is hard for those low ranks, but stuff like what to pull, damage mitigation, and stuff like that are rarely brought up, and will be important when I CAN hold aggro.
---
I mean DM has no prebis loot for fury and plenty of other classes have a similar situation
---
Dude chill, it's just a game.
---
Its evolved form is Cobra backwards.
---
I really think the Alliance aesthic acts like a great filter, always seems like that faction getting way too upset over pedantic shit  or pve performance like this.
---
Pandering to streamers, mostly
---
Keep calm and levitate.
---
Oh, could be a subreddit about improvement and ideas :). Wow classic + could be awesome.
---
Re read what I said, i agree that it would only work to gain threat on a body pull.
---
Not a chance. After what they did to Gnomer, we're not letitng them turn IF into a giant irradiated lava pool.
---
Can always dance to zerker for zerker rage too then hop into defensive.
---
I think the difference is there are only 3 of this item while there are usually hundreds of wildvine.
---
&gt;5.  
---
&gt;No real world politics or religion
---
Rule #5. No attacking liberals.
---
If you have issues with tanking as a druid no matter how your dungeon plays you are making some kind of mistake. Prehot yourself, use enrage, save rage from previous fight etc etc
---
With 10-minute tribute runs up and coming. I'm curious what the influx of all of the gold Hunter's will inject into the economy will do. And if you're a retail player: DMTribute runs offer up the ability for Hunter's to earn 800+g/day quite easily and it's nearly all through vendor sales.
---
Perhaps Tribute and Tribute loot will be different in Classic vs pserver? Or perhaps it will operate differently? :thinking:
---
If you liked tanking go back to that. I saw a video the other day of a 15 man onyxia run with Druid as the main tank.
---
Dont be upset at blizz. We had this for fifteen years before someone even noticed it i guess haha
---
Free market economy...
---
Nothing to see here.
---
Bear tanks have any easier time than warrior tanks at keeping aggro until endgame.
---
You already have your AoE ready at second 0 with thorns and can put hots on you for extra aggro. 
---
Warrior is pretty empty at the start and more likely to miss a hit which can be devastating
---
Ah. Well if that's the case we won't see it for a while :/ It's such a good scope especially for when you're transitioning from MC to BWL, or when you start racking up a nice amount of set items but not quite enough for a seamless swap.
---
Wait you guys are getting paid????
---
Zesty clam meat is pretty cheap in the AH.
---
Yes, shadow, like all the caster hybrids,  deals decent damage. The caveat? You run out of mana. Like really really fast. You'll spend ages farming consumables and it will still be a shitty experience(low range on MF, no AoE, Shackle is UD only, dungeons is either drink every pack or wand because you dont wanna waste your mana consumables there, etc)     
---
I can see it being fun if you use raiding to enhance your PvP kit which will make you a monster, but Shadow PvE in vanilla is miserable, and not because of your damage.
---
Who do?
---
I don‚Äôt even understand what you‚Äôre arguing.  The Necropile robe is just straight up better for PVP.
---
If it's undead or demon, you can pull with Exorcism (30yd range).
---
Other than that, you're correct.  It's pretty much body pull.
---
But I like being Prot :)
---
By world pvp you mean making raids to kill people that just mind their own business? You won't get real pvp until both sides are interested in fighting.
---
mage trinket is terrible though =)
---
Bow
---
It's Dire Mall.
---
The nelfs built this mall back before the whole live/work/play mixed-use craze. Then consumer preferences changed, the anchor tenants closed up shop and traffic steadily declined until it was largely abandoned.
---
Then the ogres arrived.
---
Useful contribution
---
I wouldn't mind them straight up doing 12 content phases to match each 1.X patch. Keeps things on a more constant release instead of lumping two patches worth of content at once.
---
I agree, this is why we wanted #nochanges - not because we don't want cool stuff like animations, models or whatever, but because we don't want that shit to be the norm. Same here. This better not carry on.
---
What's the shaman doing in the barrens?
---
Yes that would help, but taking 1 minute to realize the average percent cost of spells deals with that. Hard because most druids are not healers atm so they aren't as mana conscious.
---
I had a guy invite me to a party for WC. He said let's get some more. I was like cool. Not 60 later did he promote me to group lead and then leave. If you want me to help find people, okay, tell me. But if you invite me to YOUR group, it's kind of up to you to find others.
---
Copied the entire guild's charter they merged with and they change things mid and after raids to benefit the inner circle.
---
Yup.  Warriors struggle with that too.  Usually a reminder "give me 3 seconds before you engage" is enough to get them to hold back. 
---
I find feral charge also gets you out in front and usually gives you a second to get aggro going before they catch up.
---
What do you mean?  Deadmines has been out since classic launched.
---
no you
---
Sounds like a lot of overreacting and drama queening to me. Nothing wrong with releasing it at that time.
---
Then why rush to endgame? Everyone knew what we were getting. There's no point in bitching about having no content when you rushed through it. There was 60 levels of content you basically skipped dungeon cleaving.
---
Many infernals were killed and lots of Gromsblood was harvested, but in the end I managed to get my Warden Staff at just the right level. I might not hit 60, but at least I got this!
---
No idea if you're a priest or druid. If you are, still follow what everyone else said, wait a bit and sell it when less are being found. The increased healing is nice, but that stat is only helpful when you have enough to efficiently down-rank spells at higher levels. By then there's better weapons.
---
You have the 2% crit chest from BRD and HoJ; don't mention luck at this point.
---
Maybe you should pay more attention next time. You're a hunter, you have a lot of time to stare at the screen between auto shots, shouldn't be too difficult.
---
I think I speak for many of us players with responsibilities in life, when I say that we expected Blizzard to "timegate" content for the no-lifers by releasing on a schedule that paralleled vanilla. Or jived with reasonable time investment.  
---
That would at least allow the rest of us (who aren't already 60 with all thus far pre-BiS or better) to partake in the wave of Dire Maul groups.
---
Ah gotchya.  Ok, i was an MT/OT in an endgame guild back in vanilla so tanking is kind of natural and i have tanked that way from wailing caverns up so i guess that is why i havent noticed a difference.  
---
That makes sense though for someone who was not used to tanking that sort of instance
---
I know more than you.
---
There's a flight point in Booty Bay.
---
I don't like the real world. I can't compete with 7 billion people.
---
^ this guy plays mage
---
Oh nice, it looked like that was a bug you'd found and figured out how it worked, it looked like a well practiced move.
---
Either way, I bet that was a bit of a shock to find out that would happen
---
It really depends on how long it takes you to get 8/8 T1 for hunters, you cant still put together some really solid mix and match builds until then.
---
Can any classes solo it? Or something else in DM for good money?
---
Hey, if one guy on the internet disagrees with it, then Blizzard is a complete and utter failure and should just shitcan Classic entirely!
---
DM was less of a catch up and more of a "Oh shit most of the gear we made was hot ass".  Since the classic release has the redesigned shit, it's less of an issue.  Also it was largely a boost for casters since almost nothing pre-raid had spell damage/healing except accessories and weapons.
---
When fighting always put either of your ice traps down. The aoe slow will likely allow you to get range but the one that freezes them in a block should always be down when you are leveling in a contested zone and you should stand right on top of it. Flare the spot you want to kite to if you are kiting instead of having your pet tank. Prepping is a big deal in classic. Also get you some potions to cleanse poisons. Jungle remedy can be farmed in stv off kurzen medicine men. health pots, swiftness potions, swim speed potions...there are a ton of options but they do mean you have to put in extra effort. So you can either put in the extra effort and gold or accept that you will die on occasion while leveling. I personally love to turn a fight and it feels amazing to me when I successfully turn a gank around so I put in the prep work however....I still get wrecked all the time. No matter what faction you are you will find the enemy faction isn't interested in a fair fight. They want to win obviously so they will attack you when they perceive you are at your weakest so even if you prep you are still going to die a lot to ganks. That's just a pvp server
---
Yup, blizzard absolutely wants to tank their own games and lose money. There is nothing blizzard loves more then losing money. You caught them
---
The "Tarnished Elven Ring"
---
Ikr. It's kinda bonkers. It's nice though, because a lot of classes are really struggling with the damn hit requirements.
---
I feel sorry for casters who have to deal with nearly no spell hit for ages still. The resist % on raid bosses is brutal. I think it's 16% base chance to miss/resist or something. Absolutely bonkers.
---
He can't control his size it's not his fault
---
I didn't think about that. That's a good point
---
A bit off topic, but the funniest gquit fail iv seen was just 2 weeks ago in our classic guild. Guy needs a boe epic saying he needs it, then about 2 mins later advertises the item for sale IN GUILD CHAT by accident.
---
This is immediately followed by "oops" then ".gquit". He got flamed pretty hard from dozens of whispers after that.
---
The world peter is super old slang for penis.
---
It's the only piece of information we have. Now that we have this information it's more likely that we see a fast deployment of phases than that we see a slow one. It's still possible that the phases could come out at a glacial pace - this doesn't prove anything either way - but it's silly to ignore the evidence we have. And the evidence is that Blizzard will do a fast schedule of phases. 
---
My guess is that they want to get classic out of the way before the next retail release to try and avoid splitting the population. But a lot of the population have resubscribed for classic, they've not  switched over from retail.
---
Completely false. 
---

MC is already simple to clear.
---
If they REMOVED some dungeons MC would be simple to clear.
---
If they nerfed itemisation back to its 1.4 state MC would be simple to clear.
---
If they nerfed classes back to their 1.4 state MC would be simple to clear.
---
"Oh no MC will be easy" is not an argument. Because MC has ALWAYS been easy unless you were doing it in the first 2-3 months of the game coming out when everyone was garbage and didn't even use keybinds.
---
You can try desolace / arathi / alterac along with stv. It gets real awkward because if you don't grind out a few levels in dungeons you end up going back and forth a ton just to keep quest your level.  If you ever feel lost just grind 2 levels and go back to that area and you're solid.
---
That things were more difficult than actual Vanilla. It‚Äôs usually due to a lack of reference for what things actually were and everyone remembering ‚ÄúHard‚Äù.
---
AV Archers could 2-3 shot you and you get Aggro of up to 4 shooting you at once. but on the classic beta AV, level 58s in terrible blues EASILY beat the BG when on PSevers AQ-Naxx geared 60s couldn‚Äôt do anything if 2 Mages defended due to NPCs being so strong.
---
Why continue to make a mistake simply because you did it wrong the first time?
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a part of the rebel alliance and a traitor. Take her away!‚Äù
---
If your DPS starts to AOE before you've had a chance to use a single swipe it's a problem with the DPS. I'm a good tank, been complimented on it multiple times. I simply made this post to make people aware. Druid tanking is different than warrior tanking.
---
I mean.. there is only once piece of gear from DM for mages that's better than what you get from other dungeons. Can't speak for other classes but its not really a big deal.
---
45-55
---
DM doesn't, but if it's a fast release of everything else then we'll see TBC classic before ppl have cleared AQ etc, and that will directly affect people's ability to experience those later raid tiers "properly".
---
Yeah, but hunters already have a huge gold advantage on most classes that can't solo maraudon. Plus, hunters kinda need every advantage they can get.
---
Back in the day, you didn't really have choice so a lot of us hung around indefinitely.
---
In today's age, there's great content and a lot of variety throughout games. It will be interesting to see how they handle it.
---
What other classes can solo tribute? Do Hunters/Locks needs MC+ gear or can it be done at 60 in greens and blues?
---
So you think someone playing 5 hours a day is casual?  Not so sure about that one.  Games been out 37? days, 5 hours a day would put you at 7d17h /played, which is longer than it takes most to hit 60.  If that were true I don't think there'd be so many complains about DM already dropping.
---
Honestly wasn't that bad
---
You mean phase 3?
---
And the water on high quality looks like water
---
Alright but, if the majority of prot palas threat came from holy shield, was it even possible for them to effectively tank the boss?
---
There is some confusion if grey quests give rep or not. You might want to do a test. If they do, do all the NE noob quests you can find. I know I did that for a Mechanostrider as a Dwarf but that may have been in TBC. (freeloading Gnome quests are the WORST and scattered everywhere) Other than that, there are Alliance quests that give rep to all factions, it just doesn't show in your chat window.
---
and of course there is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exh-niEWk-E). There are turn ins of weeds and dirt, you know, NE stuff.

It is not

I have a friend who has been playing somewhere between casual and average. He just hit 50. He's missed quite a few weekends of play due to irl events and has been playing Overwatch on some days as well. He doesn't use a guide and is playing a Warrior. He frequently gets sidetracked by trying to climb mountains looking for cool paths, doing his own spec research etc.. 
---
I consider him to be where most of the "pack" is, +/- 5'ish levels. My other ultra casual friend, who may not be on for days at a time is at 42.
---
Fair enough. 
---
79 seems like an exaggerated number. But then again, i don‚Äôt remember how many times it took me to get two hatchets 15yrs ago.
---
The two hander you recommend gives rakes in more agi, so it would be the better option anyway
---
The book drops from mobs in Dire Maul West AFAIK, and the sword was added with Dire Maul, so why do you think it wouldn't be in the game?
---
you say that but these items aren't just rare, they are insanely rare, like a .02 chance off of 12 mobs per reset
---
I would almost guarantee you dont have a papal fez on your realm right now on the AH
---
Unless, now stay with me, you actually enjoy playing the game without  constant carrot on a stick mechanics to keep your attention.  ADHD kids and their loot box mentality...
---
Yes! How could I not have seen that! Classic is doomed.

Drunken Parrot was originally founded back in 2007 on the Stormrage server. We played the crap out of BC, WOLK, and Cataclysm ‚Äòtill most of us moved on to different games, and different life pursuits. A small core group of RL frainds have returned for classic, and we‚Äôre looking to fill our ranks with other awesome weirdo‚Äôs to share this experience with. We‚Äôre mostly middle aged with families/jobs/responsibilities and varying levels of general dysfunction (but in a fun way!). We don‚Äôt take this game (or much of anything, really) too seriously, we take our time, we level our fishing, we /dance and /cheer, we don‚Äôt much care about efficiencies or leveling guides, we make a lot of corpse runs, we level alts, we play solo, we play in groups, we make bad jokes, we make good jokes, we quote dumb movies, we are silly, we crack wise and act a fool. We are Drunken Parrot.

Phase 2 will be 40+ man raids of both factions camping FPs and sitting in the entrances to BRM ready to oneshot you on your way to instances lol.
---
That's all it ever is, people play to efficienctly focused now for it to result in all out wars, they'd rather kill you 1 at a time in a consistent flow like via camping thorium point FP.
---
yeah i dont understand it either. it was a good  catch up for people who where late on getting 60, now you are dropping content early because " there is nothing to do ", there is plenty to do ?
---
Well this *is* reddit, a breeding ground for witch hunts and misinformation. I've seen a fair share of posts not so cut-and-dry as this where the OP left out important context that favors the person they're posting about. Better to have a guilty man go free than punish the innocent and what not.
---
I have a few faps in the bank, might not farm as many sprint pots, though. Oh, and i habe some jungle remedies and magic dust, too
---
I totally understand this. I am just answering the question that asked how there could possibly be any negative effects from releasing dire maul early.  One of these effects is that it makes MC weaker more quickly than the first time around.
---
Yes, I did. I don't answer comments I didn't read.
---
While it's true some people will always find a reason to complain and some (other) people will always find a way to abuse the system, in this case, OP isn't trying to abuse the system, but still went wrong when he ignored the unwritten rules of need vs greed by rolling need on something he should've rolled greed on, especially without discussing it with the rest of the group beforehand.
---
Dungeons? Easy, you just drop the appropriate totems and press healing wave along with chain heal every once in awhile.
---
Alliance attacks Org every couple of days on Grobbulus. I am talking 100 players+.
---
You need to get there first. As in you might want to be in Ratchet around lvl 20, but running entire stv from top to bottom is going to be dangerous even around lvl 40.
---
E: Not to mention that there is no other fp is stv, so you need to run either from Westfall or Darkshire.
---
How about maintaining the same timeline as the original game? Seems to make the most sense for an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Classic experience.
---
So much rage in zf... would love to see these ppl irl
---
Lots of people have gone 40-50 hours dry doing guild runs, if I get unlucky I'd much rather secure 3000-5000 gold than some weapons that is a ~5% upgrade, pays off more in the long run for what my goals are. You might have different goals and that's completely fine!
---
Man you couldn't be more wrong and you're stupid as hell.
---
^^D2papi ^^put ^^you ^^on ^^ignore.
---
I think many people just use it to avoid confrontation. The only times I've been ignored is when the other dude was clearly in the wrong and just being a douchebag in general, and he just didn't want me to throw some FACTS at his face.
---
if all 5 people yell aaaaaaaah and then roll will they all win?
---
And I've gone cross eyed
---
Some of the servers with only one layer are even "high" pop in the evening now, they're not really low-pop anymore.
---
You might actually be smooth brained. You've definitely spent too much time on the internet, looking at clickbait gaming outrage videos. There were no lootboxes in 2005.
---
This is like saying "dude raids rewards suck, do you have ADHD, do you like your carrot on a stick, just kill bosses for the sake of it". Your brain is squeaky smooth. There is nothing wrong with character progression in an RPG. If you want to play a game for the sake of it, Dota 2 is that way -&gt;
---
yes
---
I think identifying as a pvp mage in a game with no pvp content is pretty fuckin stupid.
---
Why the fuck not?
---
no dude...I understand that you had no shoulder slot but that is garbage for a rogue and its cloth to boot. You as a rogue should never ever be rolling on cloth. It is all garbage for you and great for someone else. Dude is right to be pissed.
---
Yeah but you guys still hit 60 within the month or so. That is not casual play to get to even 55.
---
There's another post about this with almost 1000 comments
---
I actually bought all mats for the quests few days ago when I read p2 would be coming before 2020, thinking the prices will increase by alot, guess the rise will be even faster now
---
I'm in Filthy Casuals.  I'll make sure to give ya a pst next time I see you
---
Done
---
I'll restart and see if it's fine now.
---
Dude I do it to get it off my screen, people shouldnt loot when mobs aren't dead. I hate clutter on my screen so I click it off asap.
---
On top of Righteous Defense, they also got Avenger's Shield, which helped to give them the burst aggro generation they really needed to maintain threat.
---
Definitely gnome. Usually a rogue or mage. And I say this as a human pally. Those gnomes are always attacking and then bringing down the wrath of the horde onto us quiet peaceful humans and dwarves.
---
if you can afford/support &amp; have space for it, go double monitors. ez setup. you will look back in disgust at your filthy 1 monitor plebian setup.
---
It‚Äôs hilarious that you tried to copy my yawners but yikers just sound soo stupid. In the end u just couldn‚Äôt measure up to me and...no I did not follow u, I play WoW &amp; ARR all the time. Just pure coincidence, nothin personnel
---
It has nothing to do with me being selfish.  My point is the original release timeline was fine by most people.  The minority of players who rushed the entire game complained that there's nothing to do in the game and now the release was pushed forward to appease them.
---
Those same people who are currently bitching about a lack of content will still continue to do so in another week once they've got everything they need from DM.
---
Can't wait to run Naxx on Thanksgiving.  Gonna be super fun.
---
Prolly cause his weapon skill is high
---
You're retarded.
---
Trust me most people are already 60, if not very close. The people around 40 are alts and people who barely play this game (they don't get to say what's too soon).
---
Dire Maul gear will make MC gear obsolete, outside of a few items.  Especially for casters and healers.  Your healers are about to be geared to the nines.
---
damn kids and their ADD.
---
Yeah way too soon.
---
I always ask myself if I should even bother buying devilsaur gear as a rogue? Won't I replace it soon(-ish) anyway?
---
Thanks appreciate all that :)
---
If anything I would drop herbalism for Eng but idk if I'd want to sacrifice that huge gold potential and pitfall leveling eng w.o mining
---
People are competitive that's why. They want to be first or at least be in the top 1% of worldwide playerbase to do this or that.
---
There are cloth quartermasters in the capital cities. Turn in 60 wool, silk, and mageweave, and it will unlock runecloth if you are at the right level
---
I clear $1200-$2000 a week self employed and have 13 days /played.
---
Games been out 40 days?  I was out of town for 5.  Sick and in bed for 2-3.  So in 32 days I played 13.  About 8 hours a day?
---
I mean you can work a full time job and sleep 8 hours a night and still have 8 hours a day to play...
---
100% this. If you're going to undercut me (which, go ahead, that's how the market works), don't crash the market value of the item by making huge cuts.

---
it's got wildly different drop rates here, but it's entirely possible the sample size is too small to get a good idea
---
Paladins are boring to level if you don't enjoy the playstyle/ flavor of the class. Buff yourself, auto attack, Judgement, repeat.
---
Holy Paladins are huge in raids, and many think Alliance have an advantage in raiding mostly due to Paladins. They make great Main Tank healers.
---
If you are Holy at 60, you will hit like a dead fish, but you will never die. Gold farming will be slow.
---
If you are Ret at 60, it's a little better, but very unlikely you will be able to raid Ret unless you are tight with guild leadership or you are doing PUG raids.
---
If you want to do spellcleave eye of kilrogg crap, you'll have to go Priest. Basing your decision on this is short-sighted in my opinion.
---
some people want to enjoy world pvp before it gets killed by BG's
---
I need on mats sometimes, but before I do I always explain why. I‚Äôve never had a problem with it.
---
Yeah...which is why if I pull something, it's with the expectation that I will be soloing it.
---
Where's the problem?
---
Same as when you explore it at lvl1, exploration XP is based on the zone, not the level of the character. I believe the starting zones give 70xp per area explored? This is all stuff I remember reading from another post about the same thing!
---
Because the thousand assholes who didn‚Äôt win didn‚Äôt bother posting here.
---
Cause of inflation?
---
You 'dump' your raw gold into buying up items that will be worth more gold later.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happens though
---
Paladins are fine end-game. They're the best dungeon tank in the game, and can reliably heal or tank most dungeons pretty easily. For DPS, they definitely need gear, and for RIGHT NOW they're perfectly fine as DPS spec. But as the game progresses they'll get worse and worse, so I wouldn't really count them as a viable DPS later in progression. 
---
No idea on gold farming or unique viability other than their ability to AoE tank. 
---
Finally, the biggest downside is they're ultra boring. Buff, auto attack is your entire combo. I made a Paladin to play and very quickly deleted it. That was not a fun class in my opinion.
---
As tantalizing as a justice boner fueled schadenfreude session can be, this comment is the voice of reason.
---
Are you an INTP personality type, by chance? (Meyers-Briggs)
---
Found that one guy.
---
Y'all aint ready for the next level triple tree druid jank I'm gonna try in bgs
---
For fucks sake OP do not listen to this guy.
---
Hehe, some Warlock somewhere is reading this and thinking "Oooo ... that's pretty dark"
---
Am I the only one who undercuts quite a lot just to get rid of the item?
---
Pretty sure Onyxia is a raid
---
I have fond memories of playing a DK in early WoTLK (quit WoW pre-ulduar), and loved the gameplay. It felt responsive, rather than running through rotations. It was all procs, hitting the right thing at the right moment felt good. 
---
Also if I'm misremembering DKs, my bad lol
---
What can I play to feel that way in Classic?
---
Yeah - I just did it again, when the other player still had the mob he just killed targeted.
---
or reinstall
---
Why do people think someone in their 30s is a baby boomer though?
---
That seems really stupid to me since they're literally millennials.
---
I feel you on that dying all the time. Take a break and quest for a while where the mobs are under your level.
---
You can't get aggro on AoE targets that will outpace the AoE DPS. If DPS are constantly pulling mobs off of you, then it is on them. You can either tell them to stop and focus or just let it happen. As long as you don't wipe, who cares.
---
You do see ebay sellers list things for less than competitors.  Just looking up "world of warcraft 15th" shows me it for sale at...

---
That's blasphemy (against BRD not god)
---
Unfortunately no one believes you and you present yourself as an asshole.
---
That's a likely scenario
---
Well, you don't sound like one sorry. "I have a sinking feeling phase 2 will be out during the holidays making me want to cancel any plans with the family. "
---
Anecdotal evidence.. niceeee. 
---
Strong case LOL
---
Most private servers were heavily monetized wdym
---
&gt;Not everyone has the same experience in life or online **but holy fuck is this your first time playing an online game**?
---
As a tank? Probably.
---
"Like" really is too mild of a word.  I really do love this.  If you make any prints available for sale, would you please PM me the link?
---
I‚Äôm level 60. Satire. Joke. Ha. Grrr you angry. Kek.
---
Probably 1/4 of priests I play with don't get that it helps a lot if they do
---
I'd say paladins are like 50/50 better off hitting stuff unless there is a silence risk or it is a big pull and they know they can drink after because mages, just because seal of wisdom lets them get more mana in a fight to heal with. certainly effective for bosses to do that.
---
Both of those things are true, but because of its length and the way it is set up, most farm runs will only cut to the important or necessary bosses and you'll skip a lot of it to do so.
---
It gets tedious because of how a lot of the loot works, but it still isn't quite boring. I've enjoyed the grind when I did it before and of course like anything else it isn't strictly necessary so you'll be able to break up the runs with other tasks in between.
---
There's a good reason why it is such an iconic dungeon for so many players and highly regarded as one of the best.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you can look at mirah‚Äôs song, and then look at a sword with only defense rating on it, and not know which is better in the offhand.
---
Running LBRS and then UBRS 3 times isn't fast with any group.  That's not including all the elite dragons.
---
I heard sleeping sand is capped to only work on level 30 or lower players.
---
Do you know if that's true?
---
Lol way too late? I already have every class near level 30. I should be done before phase 2 releases.
---
Yeah, I've been having trouble lately as a bear keeping threat in aoe situations. When I first hit 60, it wasn't a problem but now that people are more geared, it's really hard sometimes.
---
I've had a warlock pull threat off of me after I crit with maul twice in a row on a single mob.
---
Not much at all

---
It absolutely matters to some people. Growing up my grandma would always bring up the price of eggs and milk at the store over dinner.
---
You are now a bank with that return rate.
---
Yea.  I know the type.. same DPS that is not attacking the skull, too.
---
Not sure what you mean by "the" quests, but yes there are plenty of quests available in Searing Gorge right now.
---
Hey there, rainy face!  Don't be blue.  You have what people refer to as the mid-level malaise.  
---
"Why am I even doing this?"
---
"Why is this so hard?"
---
"Where can I quest even?  My quests are either green or red."
---
"I still need 40 gold for my mount!  Where the flip am I going to get that!?"
---
All is not lost.  All that gold you lost on the auction house is still out there in the world waiting to get picked up again.  Don't worry about gold.  Remember what Grandpa George said, "There's plenty of money out there.  They make more of it every day."
---
Dying all the time is disheartening.  I'm a mage.  Half my time played is running back to my corpse.  And 30-40 was paaaainful.  It's still painful sometimes.  
---
When I'm feeling laggy or dissatisfied, I go out to a lower leveled zone or a zone I've already been to and kill some mobs that are easy to kill.  Maybe help out people with quests.  I might gain a level or two until those red quests are orange or yellow.  
---
I just try to find something that makes me feel capable and appreciated as a player.  Then I find my enthusiasm for leveling gets renewed and I'm ready to hit the trail again.
---
TSM4 might do the trick for you
---
Sounds like my experience. Credit cards should not be a key to victory.
---
I remember the sailing and ocean combat/trade routes being cool, the gliders being fun, illegal farms were neat, and the combat was decent.
---
Imagine being in this sad sack‚Äôs guild, or otherwise willingly associating with him in anyway. What a POS
---
And you yourself are still complaining about it. Reroll or sleep in the bed you made for yourself.
---
Nice vid! What addons do you use for showing enemy cast bar and timer on dots, hots, etc?
---
Oof, why would anyone say this thinking that people would actually believe it.
---
Haters gon hate.
---
I enjoyed being that guy that would start it in Trade chat too back in the day.
---
i don‚Äôt jerk off to tier lists lol i actuslly for example think paladins are the best dungeon tank in the game but i also don‚Äôt deluded myself because i saw one youtube video where a bear tanks an extremely easy raid boss. bears are worthless when warriors do their job of boss tanking infinitely better. bears are however very good at tanking aoe packs like offtanking in raids or dungeons where warriors are worthless. sorry you just don‚Äôt know how to think for yourself and focus more on being a hipster than on facts

If you're gonna edit to thank for upvotes and gold, I'm gonna revoke my upvote.
---
Actually a lot of DM gear is better than MC and Ony (bar tier 2)
---
It‚Äôs not about being ‚Äúok with farming them‚Äù, it‚Äôs just about being far less efficient. Why would you not just do quests, get way more Xp and gold, and then buy the essences?
---
I be Spriggets. Didn't think youd actually post to Reddit, though... 
---
Cheers, fam.
---
Oh where do I find this?
---
So what youre saying is it is against the rules, but not if they are battle.net friends?
---
I never claimed "We are fully kitted out, fully geared" from MC. Almost no one is because there has only been so many resets, but lets clear MC is a cakewalk, the Stalagg discord has over 25 guilds on HORDE SIDE ALONE that have verified a Rag kill. Those are just the ones that sent in screenshots not counting pugs etc. 
---
We have plenty of family goers in our guild, they just make time for raid once a week and we bang it out. Like I said, it's not hard. 
---
Waiting for the "average joe" to waddle his way up to 60 is not a healthy mentality for keeping a thriving player base. Phase 2 is extremely dry, theres nothing wrong with letting people start farming honor and doing other things.
---
Only 30, let me know when you get to 65 and the hunter wins it.
---
Unit Scan!
---
I think 5 hours a day is already tipping into hardcore territory regardless of how fast you level. That's a lot of time investment.
---
Haha, that's what I told him. He was just very convinced that he had to go through WPL. Then he ran away from me and a spider two shot him.
---
When you see a low level die like that, it changes something in you. I can't let a man with that much resolve die for nothing.
---
I was okay with it in retail, but being in classic makes it much more enjoyable. I'm more of an Anal [Insert skill name] kind of guy.
---
I don't think DM offers any Pre-Raid Bid for Rogue's but I could be wrong
---
i mean you can just look at their abilities functionality and details like the cooldowns and values and draw your own conclusion. i am perfectly capable of writing a coherent paragraph  based on my experience as a high level dungeon healer and raid healer. i do not consider myself an expert but i do consider myself a free thinker and i think that the value of an arguements logic is more structurally significant than if i decide to go back and correct every little typo i make for the sake of convincing you it‚Äôs correct. frankly any opinion you get here, whether it‚Äôs typed correctly or not, should be cross referenced with your own takes on the abilities and classes and then if it checks out you can trust it, so you taking everything said at face value is more of a reflection of your abilities, not mine. but it‚Äôs fine really sorry for trying to help, my bad for having an unpopular opinion. i accept that
---
I get that I‚Äôm way ahead of the pack but I‚Äôd like more non raid content ASAP. Not only that but as a priest my only viable gold farming is spamming mara, a level 50 dungeon. Been 60 for about a month, I have everything I could get outside of a couple t1 pieces and my t2 pants. I expect and understand there will be a content drought for people like myself, but DM isn‚Äôt content we should worry about time gating imo. It helps us more hardcore players out by giving us primo farming content, and it helps those who are behind the first pack of 60s by giving them great content to play as well as great loot to farm for.
---
Not only that, but I‚Äôm certain I speak for every mana class when I say we need better mage water.
---
Old news but I thought I'd mention it.This addon is no longer being updated by the creator. It has 2 major bugs that are what I consider deal breakers. At level 60, your XP bar does not disappear, or even give you the option to replace with reputation bar. 2nd, you can't even enable the reputation bar at all.
---
As a compromise, I recommend [Bartender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4/files). If you /bt and go into Presets, you can select the Two bars wide option, and have a similar look. You will need to re-enable and move the bag and micro bars, but I have something that is fully functional, and preserves the look. As a bonus you can turn on the lions instead of gryphons.
---
Bartender also adds a bar for Cat Form Prowl, and automatically replaces Bear Form with Dire Bear Form without you having to redo your Bear Form bar. Overall super great. I do miss this old addon though, I liked not having to configure anything.
---

Hope this all helps, I wish we didn't have to give up this glorious BfA UI.
---
End of year is phase 2, and that's just pvp patch, there's not much more going to be with it. I don't expect it before mid-end November.
---
But to be fair, the first tier raid is a bit of a joke to say the least.
---
BWL is going to be a wall for a lot of people.
---
lol dude you came to the internet to complain about internet trolling... cmon man
---
go get atlasloot then select the dungeon then the bosses, it'll tell you what drops and which phase

My brother was running me through DM and while I was stuck in loot animation with nothing on any of the mobs, I‚Äôd still see xp notifications, but I couldn‚Äôt perform any actions or loot myself. It‚Äôs infuriating that with 100mbps download and upload internet speeds, I‚Äôm getting latency in game of spikes ranging from the 200s, increasing upwards of 6000+. Its 2019, how is this still an issue?
---
Damn Redridge/Duskwood my favorite alliance leveling zones probably my favorite zones in the game. Feel bad you don't feel the same way :(
---
Um... ashenvale???? I don't really like NE areas so I don't know their levels the best. Lock Modan would work as well
---
ah i never realized a pet could learn both. for MC how would you spread your talent points I guess? obviously max out FR resistance, bite, claw, but do you get dash?
---
It's drops a bow that is + to hit. Probably not better than Blackcrow but much easier to farm. It also drops a ring that is + to hit with a bunch of agi. Also a solid set of legs with a ton of str/stam/agi and + to crit.
---
it only "obviously needs" it if you buy into this arbitrary philosophy of there always being some new content to do at all possible times for all people
---
its ridiculous
---
What does it do exactly, I'm new to macros and trying to learn as much as I can
---
So, I‚Äôm new to world of warcraft.  Classic is my first time experiencing wow. I started on thunderfury, but moved over to Grobbulus. 
---
Right now I have a level 20 NE druid. I haven‚Äôt had any issues so far wrapping my head around when to use specific skills and shifting between animal forms. I really like the class and its flexibility.  
---
My concern is when it comes to running dungeons. I know the best fit for druid is probably to tank, and I WANT to learn to tank, but being new and A: not knowing the adds, flow or layout of various dungeons(I want to run deadmines this week) and B: learning how to tank in general; is paralyzing me on wanting to continue to play this class.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed. I know there‚Äôs a shortage of tanks, should I just throw caution to the wind and go for it and hopefully find a group that can give tips? Try to get in as DPS to learn the dungeon, first? Open to thoughts and suggestions!
---
"No changes" refers to vanilla -&gt; classic. It doesn't mean no changes to the content release plan.
---
I had to look it up but its pretty spot on. I just know that I am an asshole and can almost guarantee I am on the KOS list of my server, I get distracted and just run around killing people instead of leveling still at 50. After awhile I just get camped until I'm blue in the face, but i enjoy the chaos it brings. But I deal with the consequences of being that asshole.
---
&gt;mY gUiLd WiLl ReMeMbEr YoU 
---
lmao this dude needs a new hobby
---
Not to me.  Why would you even play on a pvp server if you don't like stuff like that?
---
As others have mentioned, keeping an entire group (4+) on you the whole time while DPS goes ham is virtually impossible. So you should focus on mitigating the danger.
---
If it is a mix of elites and non-elites, your initial focus should be on the elites. They must never have their way with the casters. The nonelites can be burned down by dps. Some spawns have nonelite casters in them; those  should be designated priority targets. Some spawns are just so large that dealing with the nonelites first is prudent. The Earthen spawns in Uldaman satisfy both these conditions.
---
An opening thunderclap, followed by Piercing Howl or Demoralizing Shout is a good way to clump the group. If you have a mage, that's a good time for a mass freeze. Don't spam Battleshout (the +AP) shout, it has no threat generation that I'm aware of.
---
Tab target through the spawn as you fight, applying sunders and revenges liberally around. Make sure no mob is looking at someone other than you.
---
Through all of this your goal is to keep the most dangerous mobs focused on you, even if it means weaker ones are not. With practice and a group that isn't super overzealous, you should be able to to keep 3-4 mobs on you without too much trouble.
---
Can you expand on this?
---
4 mages and a priest
---
your health and plate allowed you to last that long. against cloth casters, rouges can actually kill them in 1 shot with a crit ambush
---
The spot they tell you to go to until 40 in Desolace got nerfed unfortunately
---
I looked it up and as far as I can tell invasions were a 2 week only wvent?
---
&gt; It's been months 
---
why do modern blizzard gamers do this lmao
---
Interesting to me that most people here agree you are in the wrong. I assumed it would be the other way around. I thought i was in the minority thinking "needing" valuable tradeable items is nonsense.
---
&gt;My guild will remember you.
---
Good, maybe THEY can come and tank for their shitty guild mates to begin with.
---
Biggest feral tax is crowd pummeler though.  :P
---
My subscription is over, I'm out of Lock :(
---
Hahaha poor guy.  The backing up was a bad sign, as well as even if she made the jump, that pet would've come back to haunt ya'll lmao
---
i dont think its against the rules. and btw I played 2 account on a pvp server back in tbc, one for hordeand one for alli
---
This dude is not going to be able to play that char anymore
---
Woooh! So much to do.
---
Close, I tested as an INFP, the mediator/empath.
---
I tried using RareSpawn (something like this) but it just tells you when you enter a rare mob area. Which one are you using to pop on your screen?
---
/u/Feargasm said that asses in groups are always a gnome mage, not that all gnome mages are asses in groups.  Important distinction.  For all we know it could be a single gnome mage being an ass in each group he's a part of.
---
I'm late to reply, but I agree on your sentiments and have posted many times regarding single server BGs.
---
IF Blizzard were smarter they would have done the following.
---
Posted that Classic would have
---
* Single server BGs at least for the first few phases. This encourages 50/50 faction ratios because nobody wants to wait hours for BG queues. Give people a taste of single server BGs before implementing cross realm, if at all.
---
* Implement server balancing mechanics. Info graphics on server balance, lock out character creation to overpop faction, etc...
---
Blizz has demonstrated a lack of foresight and skill. At this point of server imbalances, single server BGs don't seem a possibility. I am disappointed because I thoroughly enjoyed single server BGs and the sense of community. Anyone that did not BG frequently on the same server just won't understand. 
---
You knew who was going for High Warlord, and the next people in line. You knew who to avoid on the battlefield and who to help out/follow.
---
It's a missed opportunity by Blizz.
---
And the cloak
---
well as someone who relates, this made me giggle. you're a hit with me
---
Unit Scan :)
---
425 for no miss
---
I wish they'd wait... I've been 60 for a few weeks but it's pretty clear the vast majority of players are not 60 and ready for more content. My tin-foil hat theory is that the streamers are losing interest and the variety streamers are leaving so it's time to pump some more interest in. Getting streamers to play your game is such a great form of advertisement for a lot of games these days.
---
That being said... I want better water and I want it now! Going to call 1-877-8H20-NOW.
---
No. Devilsaur is still the best pre-raid BiS for all phases.
---
It just needs to last long enough to transfer people from classic to the next expansion. They're not able to monetize classic like they do retail.
---
Ugh, another BFA cinematic. Bring back the old conflicts and enough of the hugging shit
---
Quit in wrathful post cata changes, came back to try cata never played competitively in cata ... That was a lot of scrolling just to be wrong -__-
---
Two different posts, with different contexts
---
Believe what you want lol im not trying to prove anything here just commenting on the hair trigger ignores
---
People like this are the worst and I can only imagine this is a child, i cant imagine an adult acting like this seriously...
---
43 Warrior considering trying out some ZF melee cleave runs...is it imperative that I use Ravager for these or is WW axe okay?
---
Some people pay, yes.  I give for free to groups, as well as offering free if I'm idling in a city, but I certainly don't *decline* tips...
---
The addons make it quicker to find what items are selling for, making finding a selling price more smooth. The addons simply take the clunky ui and make it more easily usable. They do not auction things for you
---
&lt;3
---
I have just been manually setting up macros as I needed them
---
Holy fuck. HOLY FUCK. My monk on retail was originally named Windwanker. During the wow legion pre release event where it was crazy easy to level during an invasion I got slapped with a fucking name change. OP this thread resonates with me on a very real and personal level.
---
Lol I am so curious what they plan after phase 6. Fresh servers so people can relive server first achievements, or classic+ or something else? TBC perhaps. who knows I just hope they don't change any of the classes.
---
MC/Ony isn't much in terms of content.... even people walking in without much experience are crushing through it fast.
---
Dire maul gives a good variety of places to go besides UBRS/LBRS/BRD in your 50's.
---
the golden rule is this.
---
doing something all the times instead of waiting in orgrimmar 7 days for the perfect invite. I rather go and farm HoJ with 4 melee than wait 4 hours in Orgrimmar for 4 mage
---
That's about where I was at. Took a little time getting a group together but once we got started in ZF non AoE group, we were hovering at 30k with the first few bars of rested xp. I just wanna get the grind over with so I can... grind more.
---
Dark Iron Pulverizer + Mace spec and cheap hamstring spam mmm mmm good.
---
I think weakaura custom bar should manage this. You might want to look into it. Requires scripting though.
---
His response was completely appropriate.  Did you even read it?
---
Depends on class you will have a hard time as a druid me thinks
---
I love the reluctant smackdown
---
Yeah but we‚Äôre adults with real jobs
---
I'm no psychoanalyst, you got that part right. Fortunately it doesn't take one to deduce there's something off about you seeing how you just flew off the handle over nothing.
---
curse these fat fingers is definitely there, fuck that quest
---
Anyone else struggling to make an appearance for their character? It's dumb but I keep restarting my paladin because I'm not happy with how he looks. I know it doesn't matter but that stuff has always been important to me
---
And then you ganked him shortly after. Great job, for the horde!
---
Tanking is really trivial once you get some runs in. As a druid, you don't have to do much more than be in bear form and spam the 2 1/2 skills you currently have while occasionally tabbing through the mobs to make sure you generate threat on all of them. Have taunt ready, and that's about the gist of it. 
---
As for the layouts, just let your group know and have them lead the way. You're a tank and you're going to be treated like royalty just for that.
---
So my advice is: go try it out. It's not rocket science, and you wouldn't be the first or the last tank to wipe a group. It happens.
---
You dont HAVE to tank. If you want to tank though, just go for it and let the group know you're new to tanking. Go watch some videos on youtube. You can only learn by getting out there and trying it.
---
Warlocks can do 50/hr farming mara with mining and/or herbalism.
---
What babe?
---
You're wrong. 
---
A "lottery" of 5 specific numbers, regardless of order, has 5 correct numbers on the first roll, 4 on the second, 3 on the third, and so on.
---
A sequence has more possibilities as it does not require 5 exact numbers. The first roll was a 33, it can straighten with any number between 29 and 37, eight possible numbers, and then needs numbers depending on the number drawn second. If 33 comes before 37, only three winning numbers are possible and it's 1 in a million from there. however, if 33 is followed by 34, there are six correct numbers that can come on the third roll, as opposed to three correct numbers for the winning lottery numbers.
---
The odds of five numbers making a sequence without respect to order are higher than any five specific numbers without respect to order.
---
What was the point of you saying that?
---
Separating the good from the bad I see.
---
I play on Herod on alliance. Time to add behead to my blacklist. Toxic as fuck.
---
I guess Engi doesn't help with that at all either as you have a 1 min cooldown and huge expenses involved.
---
I don't really need to go out of my way to please people outside of my guild or friends for 5 man content. Tanks will get full preraid bis pretty quick with how many people need tanks nowadays on my server. Also, if I as a tank am whispered from a full group looking for a tank and I counter with an offer "I'm rolling on off spec gear, I want gold, etc" I'm not forcing them to take that deal. It's either worth it to them or it's not, that's entirely their decision.
---
Kinda sad tbh.
---
Awesome, that clears things up a lot! Although I'm going to struggle with not buying every new skill available.
---
Does anyone know how to get this setup with Luna unit frames? This add-on worked for me, but then I switched to Luna and couldn't get the Luna mana bar to work.
---
:( priest been melting me but undead have stupid auto win fear immunity. Still sad u lost to someone 9 levels lower though not going to lie lol. 
---
That is one thing I hate about vanilla/classic is bullshit pvp racials. Don't understand why blizz thought it was a good idea but.... been that way since release and apparently people ok with it. Be funny to see how many people stopped playing undead if they didn't have this dumb racial
---
They swear there‚Äôs more depth to the combat system than this
---
Every week the servers have a nightly reset (e.g. Wednesday night between 3 and 4 AM.)
---
This guy is really complaining about more content because he feels he has to neglect his family in order to experience it omg
---
I'm Horde on Herod. Hello!
---
Holy pally shares dungeon and raid gear with priests right?
---
Yeah, but it takes a few seconds to tab / sunder or pop a WW. If you blast off with Blizzard immediately, there's not much I can do.
---
You'll ambush kill me from stealth after you get back anyway though, right? So the whole part where I kill you initially is just a waste of both of our time.
---
Maybe, have you met some adults though? I wouldn't be shocked if he was in his 40s.
---
10s for 1 manna biscuit
---
9s for fort
---
9s for spirit
---
(casting both party buffs drains your mana so add another biscuit or two per buff round)
---
~1g50s for Major mana pot
---
~2g for dark rune/demonic rune
---
~25s for nightfin soup
---
add whatever elixir you want to use
---
feels like more than 2 consumables to me. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúforced‚Äù by groups to use these consumables in dungeons (alternative of letting us wipe) and none of it is free.
---
Holy Paladins are literally irreplaceable in raid. They have infinite mana when played and geared right, which is huge. Also, their Cleanse lets them dispel 1 each of a poison, disease, and magic effect, putting them better than I think every other healer in terms of debuff removal. Finally, Blessings are absurdly good. Their only weakness is a lack of aoe healing, but every raid will want at least one or two Holy Paladins in it for tank healing, because their single-target heals are just that good. 
---
Outside raids, Paladins are the definition of the tortoise in the fable of the tortoise and the hare. They're slow and steady, able to grind down damn-near anything - on one memorable occasion, I soloed the level 48 elite in Searing Gorge for the key when I was only like 44. You can grind down damn-near anything, eventually. But, it's not a fast class. Its offensive options are severely limited because of all the utility it was given. 
---
From my understanding, they have very good aoe grinding potential, because Consecration + Holy Shield is a disgustingly powerful combination on a tank. Also, the build that lets you aoe grind is great for tanking dungeons, which you will be unmatched for in any group with three functioning brain cells between them. 
---
In short, Paladin is a top-tier healer with unmatched raid utility in basically all content. They're slow when solo, but don't really have to worry about long or big fights so long as you respect the 5-second rule. They're very good if you're okay with not being able to kill things the fastest.
---
Pacing things against people who play as a job isn't something that makes me very happy. Oh well
---
mobinfo2
---
I'm already 60... thanks for nothing.
---
Maybe my alt will get some use out of this.
---
Hey I'm a female troll priest. Cause shadow guard is op and the male troll models look dumb!
---
Classic is the most toxic community I have played with in a long time since LoL
---
If you play a couple of hours everyday you are not semi-hardcore. You are hardcore. Streamers have skewed the semi-hardcore/hardcore line because hardcore now means 8 hours a day for a month. Back in the day we called that no life.
---
You guys always kill me with this stuff. Doctored chat logs lol. You can tell photoshops in stuff like this. I also don‚Äôt really give a shit if this guy had to put his dog down. What if the guy he chewed out has a mental illness too? What if he cried himself to sleep over this? What if his mom didn‚Äôt bring him chicken tenders for his good boy points? What if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it? People can use their own judgement. If something looks sketchy or not. This is pretty obvious since the guy literally says in the whispers about how he told him he had low weapon skill. 
---
I also would find it pretty hilarious if this dude is getting harassed by random strangers since that was obviously what he hoped to have happen to OP when he threatened to post him to Reddit. But I doubt it‚Äôs happening. Most people don‚Äôt give enough of a shit to log in to another realm, make a character, and harrass some stranger over something that didn‚Äôt even happen to them in a video game.
---
It‚Äôs not really a mouse over macro. Its a targetless cast basically. I‚Äôm not sure how they made it work
---
Everyone is going to create a level 1 char and start mailing him letters.
---
Dang, where do I get that Mage rez?  Arcane tree? /s
---
Imagine thinking a pug tank is going to be upset about getting "blacklisted."
---
I like it when I get blessings in SW. It'll take me more than 5 minutes to even get anywhere where I can kill stuff but I appreciate the effort :p
---
No, a 100g item is worth 100g to someone who is only going to sell it. It's worth far more to someone who is going to use the recipe for the life of their character.  
---
Actually using the item for its purpose trumps gold gain, always. That shouldn't need explaining.
---
üòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã hoes mad
---
Nah Faerlina
---
The real eye opener here. Your friends with Andy Dalton apparently
---
Bears actually have an easier time building rage than warriors,  and the best single target threat generation in the game.  Where we fall short in dungeons is that we're not as good at AoE threat.  I've found one way to make my life easier is to always mark a focus target. If you can even get the team to focus one target down while you spread some swipes/demo roar and let your thorns and HoTs get a few ticks,  you should hold the rest of the group easy once AoE starts.
---
Its very possible that they intended to release all of phase 2 at this time but couldn't get layering down to a single layer per realm so they are waiting for the "other" stuff.
---
They never released dates on their plan so its hard to really say this is being rushed out, when its possible they intended to have all of phase 2 out at this time.
---
I got mine questing in Badlands. However, according to WoWhead, the mob I got mine on was a .0006% rate even lower than the .0013%. I was just questing not expecting anything. If you want it, don't do any dungeons and just quest all the way to 60 like me. I rarely did dungeons, only for weapon quest progressions is when I would do a dungeon. I believe in you!!
---
Jed is a pain because you gotta search for him and you need to get a larger group for UBRS, but Arena spam is really fast and really easy in comparison.  It does suck though and feels like a troll from Blizz that best in slot gear comes from such RNG.
---
It's definitely a good idea to only do a dungeon if you have at least an hour of play time.
---
Don't bother with the voidwalker as a tank, use the succubus to kill stuff faster.
---
You might not want to do full dots on every mob because fights will be shorter unless you pull 3 mobs at a time, your pet can hold aggro on one if you dont damage that one
---
Not much to think about here, just be shadowy dealers of death
---
Depends on what faction/race/class you want to play. Honestly if you just dive in you'll get a good grip of the basics of the game and can go from there with YouTube videos and guides to get a better hang of it.
---
Probably mid last week, edited on wed-friday, uploaded today (monday). why?
---
That is a big yes! The only confusion is what mats will be required as they changed through vanilla and blizz hasn't clarified.
---
You think you know anything, but you'd be wrong.  From your other post, does the 20th hold some significance?  What if he logged in on the 15th?  What about the 31st?  What special relevance does the 20th hold for you?  What if I told you he's online right this second?
---
Are you clicking them?
---
This is what poor players say
---
Congrats, you ruined an irl relationship because of a game
---
Oh and it‚Äôs the bracers thank god
---
got ignored for needing on some int gear early on as a holy paladin. They also complained that my healing was not enough that dungeon. I agree...that's why I wanted better stuff. Granted I probably was not doing great in the first place but gear helps for sure.
---
&gt; not going to bother with jed runs as mage
---
Why not? You can easily make 6 man groups, doesn't take that long to get it for the whole party.
---
Okay great! I'm glad it won't
---
Edit: though I am sad other stuff is being released before people with tougher schedules have had time to reach 60 :'(
---
What you don't see is me stealthed behind the drake.
---
Of course! I figured it was close enough so I had to share.
---
I‚Äôm nice enough to leave Dal‚ÄôRend alone but given that I‚Äôve had 2 blackcrows taken from me I‚Äôm rolling on HoJ.
---
LOL maybe that's why then
---
How many times did they need to be told that levelling was vanilla? If you skip the levelling content and rush to get to what little endgame content exists then it's on you to fill the time between phases.
---
This strikes me as one of those people that ninja looted something and the party put him on ignore so then he made up a lot of "this happened"'s to complain about people ignoring him.
---
It me
---
I feel like I play on the more frequent side than other but I‚Äôm at 43 and it seems like the majority are upper 40s and low fifty‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt see where everyone finds the time lol. That being said I have been doing professions while my buddies try and keep up.
---
let's be honest here, players won't stick around for 4-5 more months with only MC, Onyxia and World bosses as endgame content.
---
Oops the Reddit app on my phone makes it really confusing when posting/replying. I posted a new comment instead of replying to someone talking about BRD
---
That's not how it works. You can buy the recipe for 100g, so it's worth is 100g regardless of whether you sell it or use it.
---
It could be this was the original release date of Phase 2, but, layers can‚Äôt be removed on the top servers maybe. Or they want to encourage a bit of diversity in gearing so that the people arriving at 58+ range won‚Äôt be shoehorned into running the same five instances for gear
---
Its a 5man leveling instance..
---
Not just HOTs,  but also priest's inspiration and other procable spell effects.  blizz needs to get their shit together and fix this.  Its been known for a month now.
---
Love how many of those people that were calling for a true classic WoW experience ended up 'spellcleaving' (which is really aoe-grinding) their way to 60 in raid groups using a bug, and didn't experience any of it. This in itself is not a problem, as it's their call to play however they want to play.
---
But now it's those people that apparently make Blizzard want to release DM faster than intended. So now it's becoming a bit of problem. Idk, it's annoying.
---
Welcome to the club! It's a good feeling.
---
how does extra shield block % make you uncrittable/uncrushable?
---
And you‚Äôll have to do Onyxia to complete the quest, making it not ‚Äúpre-raid‚Äù
---
&gt;and still have 8 hours a day to play...
---
Yes and those who do are not the norm. The hardcore player base will always burn through content regardless of how much is available.
---
Too soon...you have awakened DM too soon Hazikostas...what is the meaning of this intrusion (on my not too stressed or serious level experience)
---
Did this 1-60. Thought more knew of this
---
Dumb. Way too early.
---
If you don‚Äôt have mage water bound so you can drink-walk in addition to using the argent ones, then idk
---
Id rather take free mana ticks on the move than 10s for a tick
---
That sounds extremely unlikely considering it drops once per 30 runs on average and a run can be done in 30 minutes with a decent group. So I'm going to to doubt that "lots of people" claim. Sure, if they weren't doing reserved runs but that's their fault.
---
Level another character to 60.
---
Funnel gear/gold/bags to your warrior.
---
Find competent players that have the same level of time as you do. Spam dungeons when you can (SM Lib/Cath/ZF/BRD/LBRS are amazing XP). Realistically, warriors really shine with a healer. If you can find a resto shaman, that duo will make your time questing/leveling 100% faster. It's worth the competition on items.
---
Many top gold making strategies revolve around DM, there's plenty for 60s to do
---
Everything but Rag is trivial. Rag is only non trivial because of the resistance gear needed for inexperienced groups.
---
Theres only 1 easy mechanic on every boss.
---
Does warlock use more shadow damage or fire?
---
It also has plenty of loot that's going to be good for raiding.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why they didn‚Äôt allow us as players to trade BOPs. But specifically, I think GMs should‚Äôve been given the authority to fix similar scenarios to my own.
---
"grievous mistake"
---
people doing LBRS and UBRS cuz theyre getting ony attune. Also a lot of melee are trying to farm dal rends, warriors want breastplate of chromatic carapace. For casters, the majority of our BIS is in scholo / strath. Give it time, people will be doing them soon. You should be seeing a lot of warriors also wanting to farm live side strath. try to convince them to also do undead with you.
---
I doubt this is the case. Most people I've seen are not even 60
---
Sounds like projection, but tell me how does that really make you feel?
---
Ok, i did all those steps and enabled it... how exavtly do you still make it show in game?
---
Bee guud
---
Get the polearm "stoneraven". If you are rich get executioner's cleaver
---
So because you have a serious wow addiction and you have 13 days played means other people should quit?
---
Nice logic bud.
---
Shadow
---
I too, brushed you off.
---
They do look dumb. I'm still partial to female trolls in retail as well. Their models were well done compared to their alpha form...
---
Not for rogues i'm afraid.
---
Its all about spellcleave aoe farming these days.
---
Probably the best open pvp Specc 14/14/23
---
It is very close to 21/8/22 tho in Performance
---
what MC fight is long enough that you need that much mp5 in the first place?
---
Are we supposed to take turns selling things on the auction house? I didn't realize I was supposed to wait until Joe's stuff sold before I was allowed to sell mine.
---
Its not a problem. some people just find it irritating or unethical, but it‚Äôs a good way to make your item show up first and it‚Äôs easy because of addons. If people wanna spend some extra copper to make them feel better then I say let them
---
This is a really stupid take. 
---
Being a serious player and having the time to commit to it are two different things.
---
No you are maintaining the market price. Undercutting by large amounts  can crash that items price. So really you are doing your fellow seller a favor by not undercutting by a lot.
---
Should be fixed in 3.19
---
Yeah but the majority of EU servers are still 2 layers, and some are 3.
---
Two hand tanking at 60 is just hell on new healers and your damage doesn‚Äôt keep aggro unless you overgear it. Also you‚Äôd get fucking shredded by many of those mobs including the UBRS elites past Rend. It‚Äôs good practice to tank with a 1h/shield anyways so you get used to things and build muscle memory.
---
People like this doesn't have a real life.
---
Didn't take me nearly 200hrs, but okay buddy.
---
Yep.

Did I say I was missing out on anything? I will be 60 in a week and get to catch up as soon as possible. In fact DM is perfect for people like me. It just the mindset of rushing content to appease the crowd that skipped content for min/maxing is just ridiculous and completely against what classic was supposed to be.  The post clearly says " to give people something to do". I am pretty sure that is a retail mind set. Vanilla was not pushing content every month.
---
How many dumbass hunters accidentally need on BOPs they can‚Äôt even equip? maybe you‚Äôre right, thousands might be close
---
I‚Äôm 2h fury running 20/31/0
---
Not mad so much as pointing and laughing.
---
It's as regular as the LFG "Pallies can't tank" conversation...gotta happen every couple hours it seems.
---
Was a priest in retail vanilla and I remember duelling and launching noobs off of zeps with love and fondness in my heart.
---
If you MC me and cleverly fire me into the void / off a cliff, I will laugh along with you wholeheartedly
---
Didn‚Äôt know that, but I guess it makes sense.
---
Might be worth it if you can disenchant and sell the mats though?
---
Yeah since we know everyone says ‚ÄúRagnaros run‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMC run.‚Äù *eyeroll*
---
I started 3 weeks late, rerolled in the middle and am decidedly taking my time this time around instead of racing to level cap and burning out. It's nice
---
There's a ton of great stuff in BRD.
---
Xaryu posted his build on YT that he‚Äôll be using as a PvP / PvE for phase 1. Check it out!
---
I have an addon that automatically undercuts so I sell stuff quickly
---
I was to sell materials I found on my adventure not play the AH
---
What race/class was he? I'm excited to corpse camp him.
---
Solo every wing of SM?
---
Where is the screen shot to prove what you said is true ?
---
People who get this angry, especially in ZF, need to step away from the computer and go outside for a while. I've seen several people have meltdowns recently and its just crazy.
---
I mean leveling is a huge part of the early vanilla experience. If you blasted through it to get to an end game you knew didnt exist you cant really blame anyone but yourself
---
The Vanilla timeline means nothing. In Vanilla, Ragnaros wasn't killed until Blackwing Lair was out. He didn't even last a week in Classic. This is Blizzard trying to catch-up to players and keep things accurate to the spirit of Classic.
---
As usual I will remind people who havent played a hunter that hunters spend a tonne in dungeons. Ammo/pet food and water with repair bills only a step down from a tanks. You cant feign out of combat every wipe ( events pet aggro etc will still mean you take the death with everyone else most of the time and mail repair with ranged wep and melee weps is not insignificant)
---
&gt;Sleep well my furry prince
---
Hmmm no idea
---
&gt; The Scourge killed them and then the Lich King raised them as Scourge. 
---
And by being raised as Scourge loyal to the Lich King they ceased to be the people or Lordaeron.   Now they were just horrific half rotten corpses walking around following a different genocidal maniac who continued to make weapons of mass destruction.  
---
&gt;Now, at that moment, the Alliance could have, and should have, accepted the Forsaken as their former loved ones and friends who were brought back undead against their will.
---
If my Mom dies and is raised from the dead by a powerful Floridaman Necromancer I will no longer consider her shambling corpse my mother.  
---
The Forsaken are fundamentally different creatures than what they were before the Scourge slew them.  Their personalities and behavior is fundamentally changed.    
---
&gt;The Alliance's consistent stupidity, xenophobic racism, and blind hatred has caused almost every problem on Azeroth.
---
This ignorant view ignores pretty much the whole history of Warcraft.  The Orcs came from another plane to invade Azeroth as their constant wars had turned their lands into a barren wasteland.  They made a pact with a demon to give them more power and make their invasion more likely to succeed.  The attacked the human kingdoms who had done nothing to the orcs to deserve this and slew and enslaved their people.  
---
The Horde is evil.  It started this war.  Sure we might call Battle for Azeroth the 4th war but it has all been a continuation of the first invasion started by the Orc Horde desiring land possessed by others because the Orcs had ruined their own lands.
---
It absolutely matters, Int=Mana pool, if you have a large enough starting mana pool, you have no need for Mp5. and the longer the fight lasts, the more mana you use, meaning the longer a fight, the larger the mana pool needs to be. 
---
Also, items with no +healing can be less mana efficient, despite giving more mana, because your healing per mana is lower.
---
Nope, Execute is its own man who don't need no weapon.
---
Shit you know Andy Dalton?
---
This is provably,  demonstrably false,  and the kind of archaic thinking that holds the whole community back.  Druids can tank all raid content save less than a few select bosses. 
---
It's only boomers and min/max p.server children that think like this.
---
Overpower is 5 rage and is my best buddy when I play my alt.
---
I think it will not have much effect on the availability of people for current content.  We have a lot of trouble finding tanks and I know several who are already almost raid logging and only do BRD for ironfoe as an example.  What I think it will do is create an immediate dramatic influx of people running dire maul which is at least more availability for people to run even if it's less so or the same for the other dungeons. Eventually it will even out because a lot of raiders are only going to benefit from a few pieces of loot in DM
---
This has to be the case IMO. Getting all servers down to 1 layer even at peak hours is their bottleneck, imagine having whitemane and faerlina down to 1 layer at peak hours in the most populated zones and having the game be playable, thats what has to happen before Blizz will release honor. I also think now since DM is coming sooner, P2 will last a very short period of time, since it will only be honor and 2 world bosses (which most players wont get a chance to actually fight ever since the top guilds will have them under lockdown). On top of that, we might get WSG very early after honor is released, once blizzard realizes that world pvp in the most pvp heavy contested zones is only going to increase their player volume issues. adding in WSG will help them to actually reduce all servers to a permanent one layer state and not have issues.
---
That almost feels retail like....
---
I am just wondering what AndyDalton's QB rating will be this season.
---
There's nothing wrong with getting a DPS to pull when they're working with a group. That strat might work just fine for a pally, but it's not going to do much for a warrior or druid.
---
The average player takes 260 hours to hit 60 on private servers, which translates to about 3 months at 3 hours a day.
---
Even at 150 hours, 3 hours a day will take you 50 days, which isn't few a few weeks.
---
&gt;You are left with 5 boring instances that you already cleared multiple times during leveling.
---
Most people haven't cleared all the instances while leveling. In fact, its tough to get groups pre-60 now that there is a large enough level 60 base for most end game instance.
---
I feel like the problem with druid is we don't have a spammable threat generator like warriors do with sunder armor. Our maul is tied to autoattack (which is very slow in the first place). Swipe and demo roar don't do much threat at all. Pre-hotting helps, but it's not as amazing as people seem to think.
---
Enrage isn't up every fight either, usually once every 3 fights.
---
Then I guess its SpartanUI being the culprit as nothing happens with actual timers on the debuffsm thanks though!
---
Takes twice as long to make per stack, should cost accordingly of course.
---
I started naming my characters after demons, I treat the toons like altars in hopes that the dark lords bless my rng. RNGesus has many followers so he can‚Äôt watch everyone, but for my dark lords, they are honored in my victories and bless my minions so
---
Same. If the mage goes "sure, open trade for water," you listen to them. If they don't say "open trade," you wait for them to do it when they're ready. In LBRS, a 5-man, the "I couldn't find you out of all four of these other people" doesn't apply.
---
Of course, in a 40-man, you find them first.
---
I don't think the Mage was intentionally being a dick, but is either pretty dense or passive aggressive if the Priest is asking repeatedly and they do nothing about it. Like, you can open trade and *then* ask the Priest to open trade next time. Is that not the obvious solution?
---
The Priest is a dick, not for asking or being confused and trying to be polite, but for leaving the other three members of the group.
---
Raids can wait but bgs and dungeons are a bit silly to hold back on imo.
---
I did this on my rogue but in vanilla WoW. Grinded from 1-60. What I remember the most was that I had a bank full of Runecloth and a lot of herbs which sold nicely. Good times.
---
The start of the quest chain is actually in the game already

---
But this isn't even a phase, just the dungoen.
---
Did you discuss loot rules before the roll?
---
haha good old Van Cleef :)
---
This weekend my guild grouped up in a raid and just camped every corner of STV. It‚Äôs fun just taking over a zone and putting questing on lockdown. If the ally‚Äôs cared they would have grouped up and fought us.
---
Try killing some horde. Even low ones. It will feel good. And it makes dying to one feel more ok.
---
Can you show me your exact talent spec? My RL buddy finally decided he'd give classic a try last week and I went warrior and he went Rogue. We're currently lvl 15 and just finished RFC and in the Barrens.
---
Also, good luck on your goal!
---
Cheers and thank you.
---
Didn‚Äôt eu come out after us?
---
As a mage, I heal an Alli player with polymorph when they are low on health. 
---
Spread love, not war.
---
The babe with the power.
---
For warrior tanks there's nothing super amazing. A couple things to note are bracers with +Defense and a cloak with +Defense. Which up till DM there is nothing similar for those slots.
---
Nothing else really there though for warrior tanks.
---
ZzzZzzzz
---
Yep and even if you do, it's so much less fun for the tank than getting tons of rage and being able to go crazy with abilities. Just because I *can* fix your fuckup does not mean it's OK to keep it up.
---
People do it more than once and I just watch them die.
---
Imo, the DK starting zone WoW's greatest bit of storytelling ever.
---
Oh :( Darn. Maybe ill just do the 2 man strat you were talking about in DM then. Well, thank you for your response!
---
Nah, hard disagree. Hard core players do NOTHING but play WoW. They don‚Äôt balance their work and life, they avoid going out, dishes pile up and their personal health is usually subject to scrutiny. People watch multiple hours of tv each night and aren‚Äôt considered ‚Äúhardcore tv viewers‚Äù, lots of people play sports for 3-5 hours 3-5 days a week, they‚Äôre not considered hardcore athletes. I think what people need to put in to perspective is that can you absolutely play a game for 3 hours a day while still going to work and cooking dinner for your family. Some people don‚Äôt feel that way, and I respect your opinion, but there‚Äôs a way to figure that balance out without it affecting your every day much if at all.
---
Fortunately for me I work a mon-fri 8-4 job and my only real responsibility outside of work is maintaining my house and taking my dog for walks, so I personally have more time than most, but one of my best friends is a field manager for his company, works weekends/attends business gatherings, has a wife and 2 daughters, yet while maintaining all this he was able to ding 60 a little less than 3 weeks after me.
---
Moral of the story is I think you need to consider people‚Äôs priorities, some people prioritize getting 60 over all else, and others prioritize it over everything AFTER they‚Äôve cared for their family and professional life. So if that‚Äôs what you consider hardcore then I guess we can agree to disagree on the terminology.
---
Will say that epic mount does count as a spell that can be interrupted and shadow locked... rare situation but a regular epic mount is better
---
I farmed this guy for a year in vanilla.  I had a druid just high enough to learn seaform that I would log onto multiple times a day to check for him.  Finally got trinket on my first kill, first time even seeing Prince.  This was right before TBC when they released arena skirmishes.  I used the tidal charm to own people all night in arena.  Next morning I logged on and they had nerfed the trinket, it now had a chance to fizzle.  I camped that trinket for a year and had it for 8 hours before they nerfed it.
---
Yeah, Eu was february 2005, same time as Dire Maul
---
&gt; could of
---
could have

 [https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295476/dire-maul-arrives-october-15th-separately-from-other-phase-2-content](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295476/dire-maul-arrives-october-15th-separately-from-other-phase-2-content) 
---
just DM, not phase 2
---
Some people just like to fight ninja-looting with more ninja-looting.
---
Dire Maul is coming out. Not all of P2
---
The people that rolled greed deserve it more, because they're not assholes.
---
The thing is their rolls don't count.  Sure they wouldn't have won in this instance, but I am talking in general.
---
I don't click on my abilities, but it is nice to see the cool downs. I also don't always want to roll midfight because I don't have time to analyze the item first.
---
People that are complaining about content are playing the game too much lol
---
Blizzard also said, "You think you want Classic, but you don't."
---
Don't believe everything superchief.
---
You should really just shut the fuck up if you don't know what you're talking about, friend.
---
Yeah buddy. I also only heal dungeons for gold now because to me thats more enjoyable than farming so no you cant have all the loot and i rather take a blue geared tank which is sufficient for the content
---
I went Axes because, at the time, I had WW Axe. I regret it, honestly, and have been seriously considering just dropping it for 5 points in anything else in the tree. While it makes certain specific drops better, relying on getting those drops is shifty at best. Doubly so since I hate tanking and therefore don't really get to run dungeons very much.
---
The game should be scaled to the top 2%. One thing Blizzard actually does right in one of their games is that they balance SC2 around pro level play, not mid tier level players. Wow should be the same, the issue with WOW imo is that they continuously began to cater the game to a more and more casual audience. In vanilla/classic, the only real way you could get better gear once you had pre raid BIS was raiding or farming high level honor ranks, I absolutely hated heroic token gear in TBC, and it only got worse from there.
---
Because that's not the type of change they're talking about. "Phases" weren't even a thing in vanilla, the whole phasing system is a "change" in that regard. Changing something that's already not like it was in vanilla isn't exactly a "#NoChange" thing.
---
Is this your alt account?
---
Mounts value is fixed. If gold is worth less in a while its better to hold on.
---
With people saying this will inflate prices, does that mean that my rogue can farm now gold better?
---
/r/agedlikemilk
---
Thank you, I will look for these later today.
---
Hamstring gives you the rage back it it doesn't hit unlike Rend. With low weapon skill and 20 rage you could do 2 rends or dozens of hamstrings in a row.
---
buy Pristine Black Diamond. They went from 7g to 50g on my realm after the announcement. Maybe you are lucky.
---
I think the slots refer to item slot on  character not your charater not in your bags
---
way too soon...
---
username checks out
---
i swear that nowdays anytime you want to explain something to someone after you notice a mistake , even if a calm collected manner, at any online game, people just RAGE instantly. its so funny.
---
I wonder why it's comming EXACTLY October 15th, I wonder.
---
Blizzard got no shame.
---
Welp, I guess it‚Äôs back to seeing that skull drop from Jed 6 times in a row and then losing the roll when the reed does drop, rinse and repeat
---
Yess normally rogues should always win that matchup except Orcwarris that resist more than 2 stuns or if a FAP is involved... than Rogues are getting murdered.
---
There are multiple Videos on YouTube about TopWarris dueling TopRogue
---
LOL, you're allowed to enter Dire Maul at 45.  It doesn't mean you should.  
---
The level range of mobs in Dire Maul starts at 54, and goes through 61.
---
Not much content atm once you get all your prebis besides farming gold lol.
---
GG bro, blizz did you dirty..
---
I'm actually more shocked, that we're not seeing a million different variants of Legolas running around everywhere.
---
never have to buy water, never have to buy food (cannibalize) eternal killing machine
---
Do we make 20 a time tho!
---
Quel‚ÄôSarrer??
---
In this case, that's the actual number of runs it took him. Of course that's a massive outlier, but you get the point. There's never really a guarantee with rng-based item drops. Meanwhile, there's a metric ton of +26-28 agi 2-handers that you can enchant with +9 int. 
---
I actually already bought my Shin Blade today - +28 agi, cost me 20g. Well spent.
---
&gt; Greeding on valuable BoE's in a pug is like leaving your car or house unlocked because everyone in your neighborhood is a decent person who wouldn't take advantage of that 
---
Its actually even dumber than that. What you describe is like greed rolling in a guild group.
---
Greed rolling on an expensive item in a pug is like leaving your car unlocked in a random sketchy part of town that you continually hear bad things about.
---
Damn that's rough !!
---
it's not good because it invalidates so much gear from scholo/brd/lbrs/ubrs/strat and even mc gear is invalidated. most people aren't even 60 and now we'll never get to play around that initial pre-raid bis stuff.
---
Might have been!
---
If I had another character I wanted to give gear to (and linen for First Aid or Tailoring + food/water) then it would be more lucrative.
---
Pickpocketing SM was more efficient...but that's Rogue specific.
---
They also seem to know a lot shit first time players wouldn‚Äôt normally grasp
---
I wonder how my 30/3/18 build would be received...
---
oh god is our lfg chat that famous now
---
Oh okay
---
For locks it‚Äôs a non issue. You lock out the demo tree, waste of a kick.
---
Lmao
---
He was, got the defias set. And no we had no aoe or stun. You just have to find the point when a single SW:P kills a mob and tank through the damage with shields and renew
---
Vote is for Shaman. They can be played similarly to Warrior and are very versatile.
---
How do locks drop aggro on Cho'rush? Or do they just power through him somehow?
---
Or you know, from a monetary standpoint for the company, there's absolutely no reason to let people lapse their subs when the content is already created and is more or less "free" to them. If they did it right they could have free content for classic moving into tbc then wrath etc for the next 4-5 years with every 1.5-2 months getting some sort of content to keep people interested. 
---
Simply copying the original release schedule of vanilla was never the stated goal of classic, and in fact was specifically mentioned as not being intended.
---
Isn't there a mechanic when you help someone kill a mob that is gray to you (regardless of party), they get much less xp for it?
---
Gonna be fun trying to find a tank when they need at least two orbs for Crusader.
---
I'll tell you as a former officer, theres a reason I left.  I could see how it was gonna go down pretty quickly after we merged.  Shifting the raid time for the first guild raid to suit the "Co-GM" schedule that week because he couldn't make Saturday.  Better to mess with ~25 other peoples schedules rather than a single person figure his own shit out, keeping BRE for himself, keeping BoEs to sell "for the guild bank" (yeah right) rather than handing out or at least letting guildies /roll for them.  Supposedly wants to co-lead, but also wants to make unilateral decisions, isn't really interested in anything beyond his own characters progression at the expense of everyone else, etc.
---
The current leadership is completely worthless and should be avoided.
---
Back when I played vanilla we used to poop our pants! Didn't everyone do that?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNGo5SMeqgo&amp;t=2s This man will answer all of your questions. Bears are great!
---
THANK YOU!!! I have been trying to figure out a way to kill this guy without his adds for the past like week. I had a friend who insisted he could be pulled alone and I was like. "I have ranged pulled him into the room -- the adds come. I have pulled him with beer. The adds come. I have walked up and hit him and only him while standing on top of him. THE ADDS COME."  I was certain I could add him if I could find a way to get him without adds but could not figure out a way to get them without him.
---
I want AV with no battlemaster in cities, just in Alterac Mtn.
---
First pic yup üëç
---
very well put together vid. Seems like you've got a good grasp of your class and tools you can use in pvp, I'd love to see more
---
I'm organizing a strength/intellect boomkin build. Embrace the oom
---
Agreed. How hard is it to shift click and look at someone‚Äôs name/level lol
---
People make this out to be such a problem when it‚Äôs not, just use common sense. Wasn‚Äôt a big problem then and isn‚Äôt now
---
there is no logic in undercutting by more than 1c.  Truth be told you're better off posting at exactly the current amount. If you're undercutting you're just cutting in line for the next sale. Affecting the asking price is bad business if you can avoid it.
---
Andy fucking Dalton!!! Absolute legend that guy.
---
Those are BIS until AQ bro.
---
Sad that the Horde needs to be schooled in honor by an forsaken rogue. My beef with ally is that they never do a fair fight, they always wait till you're half or less health and mana aggroing a mob that will slow you if you run away, or attack you in a big gang. We should have more honor than that as horde to gang up on a friggin warrior.
---
Everytime someone talks about Phases I imagine they're just misspelling phasers.
---
Unlocky :(
---
This. Most people who started when classic launched are around level 40 ish, give or take. They definitely should have just waited to release it with phase 2
---
I forgot the email address and account name of my original account(didn't touch the game for 10 years) I don't even have the ability to do this.
---
Negative outlook, but believe what you want I guess :)
---
DM is pretty significant though, mainly for the effect it will have on the economy.
---
No learn any economic principles.
---
you said "what are you buying them for?" which is easily interpreted as asking what he is using them for
---
the smiley face isn't what people are calling you out on...but its funny you think that's why and not that you sounded like an ass.
---
Fully agree, just release them already.
---
Is there a good leveling guide that includes skills &amp; weapons use based on the character level? 
---
Most guides I saw on the popular wow sites include a talent tree at level 60 and a very general overview of skills rotation while in a fight. For example, as a warlock, I've been using Immolate, Curse of Agony and Corruption and then finish a mob with a wand. Is this really how leveling until 60 is? Pretty much 3 spells and wand?
---
&gt; the average Joe/Jane who kinda logs in every now and then, does a few quests and logs off, doesn't touch the game for a few days, then logs back on for maybe 20 minutes, can do that. No way
---
Nobody in their right mind would classify the Joe and Jane you described as "semi-hardcore". What you described is a casual player at best.
---
Stop bringing in strawmen arguments.
---
The people that advocate for ALL need BOEs   have told you a bazillion times that it means A L L players NEED on BOE's.  ALL.    what part of ALL  spelled A-L-L don't you understand?
---
i am not saying that what went on here is perfect, but the problem here is not ninjaing , but bad communication.   Any dungeon where a flask recipe can drop (or similar item worth hundreds of gold), you should make it a habit to make sure everybody is on the same boat, lootwise
---
I wish people like that existed in my guild xD just hit 40 and asked if anyone could help a little and was completely shut down. I‚Äôll definitely help people in the future.
---
TIL!
---
What level are you? You have a week to dungeon spam to 60.
---
Your grandma is a he?
---
Hey you‚Äôre 1,000% in the right. But to avoid future fucking jack asses like this guy, just tell them to give you 5 - 10 minutes, heals would be appreciated and just go auto/hamstring on level mobs until it‚Äôs about 10 - 20 below your cap.
---
dont forget their 8 second cast mount when curse of tongues'd.
---
Madseasonshow
---
Fucking role play servers holy shit man
---
A hunter in my guild is named Knobb lol
---
100% 32-48 hour respawn have to make sure you are on proper layer though
---
Spirit 100%
---
There‚Äôs some way to farm epic patterns in LBRS
---
Think about what mp5 is.  Let's say you have 10 mp5 and the fight lasts one minute.  What's the difference between your 10 mp5 and an extra 120 mana from int?  Mp5 scales in usefulness with the length of the fight
---
Easily the best warlock set, rogue too
---
The dev team really killed s2(t4) gear !
---
All of my healthbars (nameplates and player frames) are all ElvUI
---
Thanks ! I'm sure you or someone like you saved me couple of times from certain death.
---
I have Tribal Leather working at 300. Would it be cheaper to buy the Devilsaur Set or cheaper to get the mats and make a set for myself?
---
I hated heroic token gear.
---
Tbh, there was no guarantee that when the mob loot was determined that it would have been a warden staff if he were in the group.
---
I doubt it was much of a relationship to begin with...
---
Yeah, i mean, no matter how they release content, we'll have fun with it. That doesn't mean it's whats best for the game though. Also, DM releasing early isn't bad in itself. If it's indicative of the rate of released content in the future, that is a problem though.
---
But bloodlust is fine
---
This happened when i was making my way to BFD. No one was answering for any group to form so i wanted to see how far i could make it on my own. As i was jumping into the water from to make my swim to the start of the tunnels I spotted a dead name hiding behind a pillar. Seeing that i had spotted him a dwarf Paladin crept out into direct view of me. What do i do? Try my luck at a fight, or try to complete my made up mission, and hope he doesn't try to cheap shot me while I single pull the Naga.
---
So I decide to try my luck...and wave at this paladin. Without doing a countering emote or a war-cry he runs and jumps down to where i am... and I wait for what I had thought was the inevitable fight. 
---
  He swims up to me and stops. Then points to me and then turns to the cave entrance, then back to me. So I point to him then swim under still thinking he will strike with my back turned. To my Astonishment the blow never comes.
---
Thus began the hour long rotating tag pulls. From the entrance of that tunnel all the way to the entrance to the Instance portal. There were close calls, and we both died once or twice but we never let those damned Naga stop us for long! 
---
So Shout out to my Alliance brothers on Bigglesworth, and especially that Paladin Turb!  Safe travels you warcraft heros.
---
Honestly wouldn't mind losing the business, vast majority of people will save the time and coppers. If someone is gonna undercut me, i'd prefer they undercut by a tiny amount and preserve the value of the item rather than go down a significant amount and ruin sales for a long time.
---
ElvUI.
---
Hey Behead if you‚Äôre reading this, please uninstall.

Spirit
---
I used to be in a raiding guild called ookem in the dooker
---
That all sounds super involved, I love stuff like this lol
---
You're not going to bait me but if you wanted to I'd meet you anywhere.
---
I ran from STV through burning steps and BRD. 
---
Wasnt as bad as I thought. Still took over an hour. But I got some flight paths for later lol
---
This is backwards. This is why you want mp5 before int early game.
---
 according to  [https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman](https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman) 
---
### Stat Priority ‚Äì Early Game
---
* MP5
---
* Intellect
---
* hSP
---
* Stamina
---
* Spell Crit
---
* Spirit
---
It is important in the early stages to pick up as many items as you can with MP5 since it is a rare and integral stat for the Resto Shaman.
---
### Stat Priority ‚Äì Late Game
---
### Intellect vs MP5
---
Both Int and MP5 provide mana, but in opposite ways. Int provides a static amount of mana up front while MP5 contributes more and more mana the longer the fight goes on. Accordingly, the relative value of MP5 on any given encounter increases with the duration of that encounter. We can easily calculate the time it would take for MP5 to surpass a given amount of Int in terms of mana provided.  
---
1 Int = 15 mana, 15.75 mana with Ancestral Knowledge  
---
1 MP5 generates 15.75 mana in 78.75 seconds
---
Quick maths:  
---
If a given boss encounter is 5 minutes (300 seconds) long, how much Int is needed to provide the same mana as 1 MP5?  
---
1 MP5 = 60 mana over 300s  
---
60 mana = 3.81 Int (with Ancestral Knowledge)
---
Swap your gear around accordingly from fight to fight. Remember that Int has a few perks over MP5 too:  
---
59.5 Int = 1% Spell Crit  
---
Int‚Äôs mana is available on demand, have to wait for MP5  
---
Int increases maximum mana pool  
---
Enables you to start using your mana consumables sooner.
---
With a sizable pool of Intellect you can afford to use your consumables in a way that is more efficient. Relying on static mana from Int rather than a constant stream of mana from MP5 makes it easier and less stressful to get your consumable rotation exactly on point.
---
I love your spirit, lol
---
I'm on the same boat! 31, married, with a baby due in 2-3 weeks.
---
This has to be catering to the streamers
---
I was playing on minimum brightness and no sound and only wow open. It still crapped out. I couldn't even see anything or hear anything lol.
---
I love you both
---
Its not the same when you get to lvl 60
---
1c makes you less of an asshole. the asshole scale goes up when the price goes down
---
Also, tab target with maul instead of swipe.  It's way better threat.
---
Im kinda drunk. I think i fixet it now.
---
It's the same school of magic... There is no demon school afaik. Warlock have shadow and fire as school of spells.

Similar thing happened to me as a rogue I finally get into a dungeon strat ud. Fucking get excited cuz was looking for a group all day so since it was taking so long I went to farm leather in ungoro when I finally get in I‚Äôm fucking stoked but then they start saying dude ur taking too long so I start tripping out cuz my hearth wasn‚Äôt in undercity fucking get there forgot to repair my gear we wipe twice cuz of the hunter multi shoting pulling more mobs. We make it to the end my whole my gear turns red we had the boss to 10 percent health but the hunter with the only aoe was just multi shoting the boss instead of the adds hitting our shaman healer. Then he starts raging at me for not fixing my gear talking about how I‚Äôm never gunna do mc LMFAO absolute clown didn‚Äôt rage at him when he made us wipe twice.
---
No. I dont even do wpvp right now because there is no honor system. And when there is im not gonna kill fishers because thats a very inefficient way to farm honor. Im going to tarren mill like everyone else. I think 99% of the people who want to grind honor will do the same. And if they are not doing it to grind honor, well.. then it doesnt make a difference, then they can just as well do it now or after BGs release to the same effect.
---
its not a shadow "tree" its a shadow "school", all summons fall under the shadow school
---
We get a minorly better bow statstick which is easy to acquire (~25% drop I think). I'm not a super experience player, but it feel DM mostly gears healers.
---
Doesn't work anymore
---
If we scaled the game off the top 2%, we would be ready for Naxx in no time. The top 2% could handle it.
---
Everyone has an excuse to be an asshole. Choosing not to anyway is what makes a decent person
---
https://www.twitch.tv/frostadamus already almost at 10k gold from grinding. Not everyone is playing the AH.
---
Why would anyone get mad over sub 60 bop items?
---
The endangered gorilla who was killed to protect a child that was in danger due to bad parenting.
---
Spawned the arguement of which is more important, the overpopulating world killing species or endangered species
---
For real? So bg:s are way more than 6 months away? Damn, think that‚Äôs it for me tbh.
---
Well, I can farm still but it's not as pressing
---
And this is why I only play horde.
---
Do you miss fury, or dual wielding? Because 2h fury is totally viable. Your Flurries end up being *awesome*.
---
Going back to weapon requests, though. I used the WW Axe up until 45 when I got The Rockpounder from Uldaman. Your weapon options are pretty slim to be honest until the mid-to-late-40s, when Uldaman, Zul'farrak, and Maraudon all become options, and all have very good 2h drops.
---
Get your shit together man you wanna act tough then grow some balls a get a job. You're not a man you're a child.
---
No, it would be like asking someone whose name is Bother if they're a pooh fan.
---
That dude needs professional help
---
Thank you I know the fight. "How" is pretty simple, people getting aggro after he TPs, not letting the tank bring him to his initial spot. Yes it's very easy, but then again so is the rest of MC if people follow the strats.
---

No, but even if you believe that they did it to themselves, they still got screwed.

No more city raids.

Meanwhile, I can‚Äôt get a BoE blue that‚Äôs worth more than 2g
---
I think at one time Blizzard just added every entry on urban dictionary  without review.
---
Who's Asmogold?
---
Hahaha, yea, stupid people who play retail, disgusting.
---
Way way too soon. Slow down.
---
I want to be your buddy and name my character Dong. I do play on Firemaw already. How about a troll mage to accompany you?
---
&gt;old talent tress are kind of a work of art
---
I can legit sit on a talent calculator for almost an hour sometimes playing around with weird builds. They are probably not optimal at all, but I can see some fun ways to use them.
---
you saw that in one vid from APES that we all saw.
---
Darth
---
The last boss is level 59, so you shouldn't be doing a full run.  However BRD can be pretty modular and has many quests for repeat visits, so if you find a group for the first chunk or so you should be fine.
---
A true hirde player would accept his help and then bow and give thanks and as hes leaving, kill him.
---
it is huge in PvP and I have been on that all the way back in original vanilla wow. just wait for that time where you got a Curse of Toungs on you and you need to go help BS but it takes forever to get on you mount because it is a spell and not a item, or that time when you manage to disengage from a fight but the mage manages to blink in to CS range and interrupts your mount and now you are stuck there again with shadow locked out. It sucks.
---
I'm very happy to pay 200g extra for my normal epic mount.
---
It made me wonder if I killed a GM in the arena and they looked at the combat log and were like "tidal charm!?!?" we gotta nerf this before rated arenas.
---
There are 2 + to hit items. One on a ring which the only other option pre raiding is the princess ring, so this lets you wear 2. And one on a bow which the only other option is out of LBRS on a much harder to reach and farm boss. Hit% is the most important stat for a warrior tank until they reach their cap.
---
The game dying.
---
you WANT to be overgeared for MC? to just rickroll the whole thing on your first try? to get a bunch of epic drops and say "pff that's not an upgrade" because you already got something better from dire maul?
---
u wouldnt do this if it was real money
---
I mean if it's just Dire Maul I guess it's okay, but this makes me worried they are going to continue to cater to the no lifers and release things crazy fast. I would like to be at the level and gear required when things get released so I can partake in it as it comes out, I didn't get to do that in vanilla, back then I hit level 60 like a week before the TBC prepatch came out, so everything was released by then. Just hit level 40 yesterday, it's hard leveling more than half a level a day when I have work, family, and *gasp* other hobbies.
---
Just wait until naxx is on farm 3 weeks after it's released, going to be fun..
---
But how are they against SPriest/Lock/Mage in WPvP? I really dont wanna go through the "there's a Warlock over there, should i just ALT + F4 and wait a few minutes for him to get done?"
---
I wanna shit on his chest
---
I‚Äôd say just have priest go healer and lock deep affliction. Just run around and dot up mobs
---
Leveling against these as a rogue is great. Kick/gouge, very low HP and armor. Actually was my favorite redridge mob.
---
I actually saw quite a few vids of mages doing that so... keep at it :)
---
Reduce most travel time by 40%.  Seems worth it.
---
Good will doesn't always get repaid. I've been ganked quite a few times soloing quests on low health by players from the other faction who were standing idle by me until they saw an opportunity.
---
Now that I come back to STV to solo quests I almost out-level, opposing faction players always /wave at me when I'm running past them even when they outnumber me 3-1. However I know they would not have hesitated to gank me had I been at the same levels as them.
---
As someone who has done pre-bis twice now I agree, however there is still a large chunk of the playerbase who is not 60. I worry that these people will miss out on some of the fun of gearing up because of this.
---
Unless the king has an enrage timer I'm unaware of, you should never get hit so even with gray items it should be doable even if it's really slow. Practice also helps a lot. When I started farming princess, it took me about 17 minutes to down her. With barely any better gear I can get sub 5 minute kills now. IIRC king is also easier to kill than Theradras since he is a more traditional kite whereas Theradras tosses rocks you gotta be wary of.
---
Idk if archmage is far more expensive via the mats or anything, but playing on Whitemane (one of the highest pop servers), the AH is incredibly cheap. A lot of stuff I try to AH is actually going for prices so low, that its actually a better idea to vendor them due to the AH cut.  I did the math a couple days ago based on actual prices in the AH to make my robes of the void. The pattern was going for 35 gold, and then the rest of the mats combined (assuming I have literally none of them myself) + the pattern would come out to less than 250 gold.  I'm at over 500 gold already and have only been 60 for less than 3 days real life time, and thats from no farming whatsoever.  Making your robes should be no problem, also you are a mage.  Don't farm the mats for your robe, farm something that is optimal gold per hour and then just buy your mats. If you aren't spending your gold on stuff you don't need, then just dungeon spam for the rest of your pre raid BIS and just by selling the stuff you get along the way, you should make more than enough gold to buy the stuff you need to make them.
---
I'm not going to put myself through Hell for the almighty dollar.
---
Because blizzard just does whatever feels right on a whim basically. Very little thought by people who know the game well goes into these decisions.
---
I don't know if you have been paying attention but gear is already invalidated. Patch 1.12 invalidates almost all of WoW Vanilla to be honest.
---
You're not going to be raiding with the guilds that are overgeared. Trust.
---
It happens a lot in BGs.
---
I'd be OK with those ignores tbh. Those are essentially children erasing you from their sight. I want them all to ignore me as well please.

&lt;Bourbon Raiders&gt; \[Horde\] \[casual\]\[PVP\] \[Fri, and Sat 9pm to 12am\] \[casual\]\[Loot council\]
---
Hello Everyone I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders, a casual Family-oriented guild recruiting for Classic.
---
Our Goal: Provide a guild for people that have kids, work 50+ hours a week, and have other real life responsibilities that keep them from joining a hardcore guild. We aim to complete all end-game content whether it is PvP or PvE related, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals in classic we would be delighted to help you achieve them.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Raid times: Friday and Saturday 9pm to 12am EST
---
Website: [bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com](https://bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com)
---
if interested, you can reach me on my battletag: Soulmauler#1583, or on Discord: Soul#6978. (Or here obviously)
---
I'd agree. I love feral druids that take over healing if we get in a sticky situation with an oom priest.
---
That means the game just started. Nobody is full bis yet, and if they are, the rest of their guild is not. 
---
Phase 2 needs like 3-4 more months.
---
Some streamer apparently. Which is another way to say "utterly useless in every possible way".
---
Nothing relevant. You can safely go on with life without a streamer impacting you in any meaningful way whatsoever.
---
Sure they got screwed, and their is no one to blame but themselves.
---
If loot rules were not established, then everyone who rolled need did nothing wrong.
---
That is used as a catch-up mechanic when there‚Äôs no reason for catch up at the moment...
---
tank can roll on dps gear, otherwise you won't be finding any tanks.
---
really shitty move on blizzard's part. basically indicates they're going to cater to the speedrunners and no-lifers
---
we'll probably have ahn quiraj by middle of next year
---
Both.
---
If the biggest WoW streamer is going back to retail, that must mean there's not enough content. Ergo, we release Dire Maul now.
---
&gt;and perhaps Deadmines/Wailing at 45, other than that I have no idea.
---
much much sooner.  At lvl 45 you can solo  Scarlet Monestary Graveyard  At lvl 60 it all depends on gear.  but anything up to lvl 50 dungeons is in general possible.
---
best classes:   hunter, mage, warlock, druid, rogue, maybe priest. warriors bad, and paladins are good when the instance has lots of undead.  
---
With my lvl 60 rogue in pre raid gear I could solo quite a lot of BRD (lvl 48-52 parts) (with all cooldowns and lots of preparations, consumables, so it was not economic, just a nice challenge
---
Yeah you're just gonna use your mother's money and take advantage or her like the sad lazy coward that you are.
---
You are over exaggerating it. It's just a dungeon. Like it would make any different if they released it in November
---
the two questing addons I use are questie and Allyroute, didnt follow the guide tho, mostly used it as something that points me in the right direction
---
Was killing a boar in westfall last week and had it down to 20% with me at 50% missed like 5 in a row died
---
It was released a month after launch in vanilla... stop
---
Ah okay. I don't understand the dps who complain about tanks pulling before they're full mana
---
Big false, yes in vanilla.
---
No, blizzard didnt say that. 1 guy did.
---
Dire Maul doesnt invalidate MC. Some of the gear is better, but it's not like you won't have a chance to do MC now. Chill out, play the game as long as you enjoy it, and progress at your own pace.
---
Also, I feel pretty safe in saying that a lot of average players are 60 and raiding at this point. If you're not 60 yet, you're pretty squarely in the casual camp, me included.
---
And you'll be fucking grateful for it
---
Where do you get this 80% approximation from? Seems like you tailor the numbers to fit your argument
---
I'm sure all priests and other healers can relate.
---
Damage and healing increased by x is your most important stat.
---
You'd probably be fine in the prison and arena areas, Lord Incendius, Fineous Darkvire, Pyromancer, and maybe Bael'gar (although the trash leading to Bael'gar would be pretty hard). Anything beyond that, probably not.
---
So you could do some of the early quests including getting the shadowforge key and arena farm.
---
No, it wasn't
---
Thats actually pretty offensive.
---
You‚Äôre gonna get downvoted for an overreaction but I get what you are saying. Classic should be stretched out and put aside. Their main game is retail. 
---
I‚Äôll take some heat from the downvotes off you.
---
I wish you were. People like you drive prices down, which screws the average player out of money and gives the rich players an easy opportunity to make money (by buying out the market and relisting for higher)
---
&gt;It's the reason why I cannot bring myself to mindlessly gank someone who is way lower level than me, or someone who is in combat.
---
I tried to uphold this code of conduct myself but kind of gave up after being the ganked ones in these situations. Now I just make decisions on whether I feel like it. If I'm omw to help a friend counter-gank or getting ready to leave a quest area, opposing factions are KOS. If I'm busy getting somewhere else I usually leave people alone unless they attack me first.
---
It's been 15 years.  WoW is the most successful MMO in history.  There is no danger of WoW dying because they release Dire Maul 6 weeks into the re-release of their franchise cornerstone game.

With the pre-bis lists and all the min maxing done nowadays you‚Äôre already overgeared for MC. What‚Äôs changing with a new dungeon?

https://math.missouristate.edu/assets/Math/Consecutive_Numbers.doc
---
I'm yet to meet an opposite faction member who's patient and kind enough to do wholesome things like this with me.
---
I had a close encounter in Searing Gorge where we had an elite mob to kill, a gnome mage showed up despite me being low health after pulling a few mobs of my own, he didn't kill me. I thought damn, what a nice fella, I pointed and jumped in the direction of the elite mob I had to kill. He took the first kill and I helped him take it down. Afterwards I sat down to basically say "Okay, now we wait for respawn so it's my turn" and what'd he do? He fucking killed me and laughed. 
---
Notice I say opposite faction not specifically Horde or Ally because I play both on 2 servers, and have found we're all the same, just different teams. I've met plenty of Undead equivalents of that Gnome mage who screwed my day at SG.
---
I'm 60. Most of my guild isn't.
---
Blizzard really shot themselves in the foot by only allowing one class per character when they created WOW
---
A bunch of mages would just powerfarm the shit out of the server, inflate AH / buyout everything on the AH and resell to set prices, and then issue predatory loans to players trying to get their necessities.
---
Those lizards got me my mount
---
Why are there Ogre's in Azeroth and Outland?
---
Whether Dire Maul is out or not doesnt affect if Im gonna look for a LBRS group or not. Players that are already full BiS or close to it have no reason to join scholo/strat/BRS groups. Instead of those players waiting for Raid resets or lvling alts or not playing, now they can do DM.
---
Lol. Was that a fury warrior who wanted you gkicked?
---
In this case git gud
---
My secret is this,  charge in with 2 hander, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, whirlwind
---
This is exactly what I'm going to do! Awesome idea. I'm going to buy my epic mount first though. A few hundred G to go.
---
This community is fucking trash. I hate to say it, but Runescape classic has a better community on Reddit than this game and it's fucking sad. I think it's mostly due to the mods.
---
Welcome to literally all of gaming. Especially competitive gaming. Look at Hearthstone and MTG, they pump out a constant stream of new content faster than the average player can even process just because the top .001% does literally nothing else with their life and gets bored. Companies are heavily incentivized to do this because streams are the primary ways that games are put into / remain in the public consciousness / conversation, which turns directly into profit.
---
The stories are true. I've been force name changed twice now and just used the same name again.. CrazyCatologist doesn't know wtf they're talking about
---
How long is that good for? Low 50s?
---
we will just get rep by playing WSG, I think the rep mark turn in may give exp, but that isnt needed
---
Jesus they‚Äôre pandering to the no lifers hard
---
I'm soooooo excited this is coming out now. I really want to hit pvp hard in phase 2, but I also want a lot of stuff from dm and this is perfect.
---
I thought overpower only procs while you're in battle stance.
---
I think this wasn't in the game at launch but was added later.
---
The average wow player has no attention span. Let them outside and they'll forget they're gamers.
---
Hahaha you super owned OP good for you dude!!! Right on!!!!
---
I've never heard of Archeage Unchained.
---
It's quite nice you'll be able to hit \~28 and not touched Duskwood.
---
Unfortunately, you can't play both at the same time.

As far as pre raid BiS goes there‚Äôs not a ton of upgrades. It‚Äôs not like people will walk out with an entirely new set of gear. It‚Äôll fill holes a bit. For me there‚Äôs only 2 drops in the whole place worth grabbing. This won‚Äôt make the other dungeons obsolete by any means.

No official post breaks it down quite that much, but the knowledge that we're getting level 55 mage water comes from the assumption that all quests associated with DM are going to be put into the game when DM is added on October 15th (earlier than phase 2) and the fact that, in vanilla, level 55 mage water was a reward from [this DM quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7463/arcane-refreshment).

Not happy how quick this is happening. I know I'm not serious enough to be cutting edge, but I'm really starting to feel completely left behind
---
you might be underestimating how much DM improves. the trinkets alone are incredible, and quel'serrar is fucking ridiculous.
---
One is good, and the other is just in the raid for totems.
---
I would assume it‚Äôs because the majority aren‚Äôt 60, and the ones who are are either farming their pre BIS, or pve spec and don‚Äôt wanna drop 50g to respec for duels when honour isn‚Äôt even a thing yet.
---
The real question is why do YOU care about asmongold? I had no idea he said this nor do I give a shit. Stop keeping up with shitty streamers. Just play your game and enjoy it. Jfc.

You can craft alliance only gloves with that.

"take life seriously" I mean.... you should lol. You only have one life. If you meant "game" then I hear ya. 
---
Still feel like my response valid. People act like Blizz still own their company lmfao. I can't even imagine being that naive.
---
why all on the same realm? would spread that out
---
Just go in the blasted lands on the immortal mobs
---
Oh god I remember you from retail, I think this one might be a bit more difficult lol.
---
We got ours off Onyxia
---
Just buy BoE items with all your gold and sell a week after DM and enjoy the free profit

It's probably more than 80%. From what ive seen in cities, vast majority arent 60, and if you consider that the higher level you are, the more you play, the more likely you are to be on at any given time, just looking at what levels are online gives an over-estimation of how many players are level 60.

You are acting as if guilds haven't been overgeared thru pre-bis since week 2. Dire Maul will give people who have been powerfarming a choice between that or Rend/Jed runs.

You're overblowing this substantially.

Is there a reason why you didn't post your class &amp; server...even your faction?  Like why not include that right out of the gate?

Haha, I do the fortitude thing too. Not so much to trick people but it‚Äôs satisfying to see that chunk of empty health appear, knowing I‚Äôll keep that person alive that much longer.

In case you still don't understand why people are upset, it's because we now know for sure that Blizzard is going to rush content for the hardcore players/streamers as they complain.
---
This could potentially speed up the entire release schedule and this game has a lifecycle.  The whole point of classic was to enjoy it but apparently rushing to raid is the only viable option for these guys. I don't get it.
---
Blizzard retention game on point.
---
You most be playing with some dogshit fury warriors then
---
Also name mobs that require a mortal strike that can‚Äôt have the healing effect bypassed by doing mechanics correctly.... because there is none. At least not that warrants bringing a fucking arms warrior to a raid. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about lol
---
I think the phases are listed in the official Classic forums, I'm not sure how detailed they are though.  As for your specific example, level 55 mage water is part of Dire Maul; it's either a quest or a drop (I forgot which) from the water elemental boss in DM East.
---
Disgusting
---
I was a druid in vanilla, this was super common.
---
Neat. What he said still holds true
---
This actually happened with the Columbine shooting back in the day.
---
There won't be an official post detailing out every thing added by the phases. The reason for the water is that the quest requires Dire Maul, which is coming out next tuesday (the 15th)
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7463](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7463)
---
They're not gonna get into the details of what every raid includes item/quest-wise as it would just be too much to cover.
---
They've covered specifically what dungeons/features/raids are coming out with each phase and that should provide enough info to figure out why a given thing is missing
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases)
---
On the other hand, time gating content is pretty retail as well.
---
I cannot think of a single thing of value that a guild website could contain that would make me want to visit it, unless the guild loot system was DKP and the points were up there to keep track of. Other than that, literally nothing.
---
Level 49, I got a full time job and professions to level! Lol
---
Agreed. Don't be retailded. Stay away from the current game.
---
I took 2 days off leading up to a 3 day weekend so I could play classic with my buddies like in the old days. Not really sure how it‚Äôs hardcore to set time aside to enjoy a past time with your good friends. Would it be any different if it were a music festival or a golf tournament?
---
Didnt know what to put it under :)

1% hit below cap is equal to 32 ap. Use that info how you will.

Are you projecting? Oh no, you‚Äôre projecting. Sad

Peer review is actually important? Anybody who has achieved anything in life would tell you...

Youre one of those people who's just impervious to logic aren't you? Or just a fat hipster who's never gonna achieve anything noteworthy in his life?
---
Shamans are a hybrid class. They can be melee DPS, magic range DPS, or a healer. They suffer from the vanilla hybrid tax which makes them lesser DPS than pure DPS classes. 
---
Restoration shamans are awesome raid healers. You will top the meters for healing. You won‚Äôt usually be a main tank healer, but are assigned to range. This class is loved in raids due to totems, especially the windfury totem for melee groups. Also useful healers in PvP.
---
Elemental shamans are the magic damage build. Awesome burst damage, but your sustained damage is less than mages. And you lack the utility, AOE, And crowd control that mages bring. Elemental shamans also have more mana issues than mages and warlocks. In vanilla, few raids accepted elemental shamans. In classic, you can find raid groups as one, but not as easily as other ranged classes. In PvP, this build is strong. It‚Äôs the best shaman pvp spec (30 ele/21 resto). But it is not a duelist spec. 
---
Enhancement shamans were a meme back in vanilla. In classic, you will find a spot, but again, you are a lesser fury warrior or rogue. A raid would rather have a resto shaman giving totems to warriors/rogues than an enhancement shaman giving slightly better totems. And some resto specs even pick up the improved totems. The spec is better than resto in duels, but much worse in groups. And it is not a great duelist spec other than the one off situation where you one shot a cloth class with a windfury triple crit. 
---
Rogues are a pure DPS class. They are the assassins of WoW. They can stealth. They do awesome single target DPS, but offer little utility to the group. As a rogue, your job is to do max DPS. You will be out damaged by fury warriors in some game phases, but are otherwise top single target damage. Range will beat you in fights where you have to move around or where there is AOE. Rogues are strong duelists (not the best duelist as warlocks are that), useful in group pvp, and top tier damage for single target. With that said, a lot of people roll rogue, so you may have to fight for a raid spot. 
---
Note that many specs that were not viable in vanilla are viable in classic. Classic raiding is easier as we have patch 1.12, which was not around till well after MC was cleared in vanilla. Things are objectively easier, and the player base knows more about the game. With that said, an enhancement shaman will have more difficulty getting a raid spot than a resto shaman. A 60 resto shaman could easily join a MC raiding guild or pug a spot in one. A 60 enhancement shaman would have to work harder to get in one.
---
You don‚Äôt have to access a shady site for someone to hit you if you don‚Äôt have a firewall...
---
Chances are your router has a firewall built in. If you were to directly connect your PC to the internet and really go with no firewall your machine would be a mess in a matter of hours.
---
More than one thing can affect prices...
---
Isn‚Äôt this post your attempt at getting the last word.
---
EU had DM release one month after vanilla came out, didn‚Äôt seem to destroy their vanilla experience.
---
You‚Äôre not experiencing MC and Ony as the original game. There‚Äôs 1.12 talents, 16 debuffslots and a lot more so that argument is invalid.
---
I do agree on the economy since tribute run has hunter is an insane gold machine. However, people have found a lot more gold farming ways compared to vanilla so the gold is already kinda skewed.
---
you're right that the gear overhaul in I think 1.11 already makes raiding easier, but the trinkets alone in dire maul are incredible, and quel serrar is fucking ridiculous. every guild is going to be overgeared because of dire maul, im not sure what your last point means.
---
This is beyond stupid. Did you even play in old days or are you a private servers kid? Want to know what was original Blizzard's game design? Two examples:
---
1) Only 1% of players killed even 1 boss in Naxxramas before BC release.
---
2) Black Temple was launched before the last boss of previous raid was killed by ANYBODY. 
---
That's all there is to say.
---
Sure let‚Äôs wait for you to level those characters then we can PvP around summer 2020
---
How so, can you explain?
---
Edit: Also a healer
---
I hope they‚Äôre not curtailing to the hardcore player base. There‚Äôs no rush on releasing the limited amount of content they have. If I was blizzard, I‚Äòd be more focused on how to ensure the more casual players don‚Äôt get left behind and miss out on content, not whether the hardcore players are getting bored. If they‚Äôre out of stuff to do, they can make an alt.
---
Thanks everyone for the replies. Where did they say DM is being added on October 15th?
---
I'm level 32 atm, no alts, just too busy to play much. Im dreading not dinging level 60 till like phase 4 and being miles behind.
---
I was pretty young back then... were people always this toxic or is it just perk of this age?
---
A Snowball killed their father, and raped their mother
---
I don't give a shit about him. But I care that Blizzard cares more about him and Esfand than the general playerbase. And you should too.
---
That's rough, man. I only play about 1 day a week but at the very least I can get in 6-8 hours. Your plight is a dire one.

Too Soon!

Huh, so it was just coincidence that the name sounded like a portmanteau of ‚Äúschool of necromancy,‚Äù which is the in game etymology of the name. Cool!
---
Just be aware that if you plan to raid endgame as a shaman,  there is a 99% chance you will be pigeonholed into a healing role.  Elemental and Enhancement shaman are considered some of the worst damage dealing specs in the game and very few guilds will entertain the idea of bringing one to a raid.
---
That being said,  if your objective is to heal endgame, playing a shaman is your absolute best bet for finding a raid spot.  Most guilds will run at least 6 shaman,  maybe even 7 or 8.

You gotta run dungeons and gear up between quests. Good armor and a good 2H makes a huge difference for warriors who are questing and grinding. Very gear dependent class.
---
Not enough groups? Like 1% of the population is even high enough level for Dire Maul. 
---
You're gonna be just fine.
---
Yeah, those people are truly the big brained super geniuses of WoW
---
This is a terrible move that really seems motivated more by corporate big-wig stuff than by devs trying to  deliver the best possible experience. Seems FAR more like a move that comes from the Retail "DROP PATCH RETAIN PLAYER" mentality. Haven't seen ANYONE who thinks this is a good idea or advocating for moving it up. I'm not even sure what Blizz is hoping to accomplish by separating this from the rest of Phase 2.

the DM trinkets are incredible, and quel serrar is fucking ridiculous. you're right about the gear overhaul though. i wish we had gotten the jank gear to start with like we did on nost

There we go. It didn‚Äôt seem like much time at all, and it was before rag died

Time gating is supposed to emulate the classic experience. The content all exists already. Retail is new development so I don't understand the comparison

Should have given us a BG instead.
---
You can cancel the trap animation. Against a good rogue it might not work but in wpvp I've had plenty of success with it.
---
God damn this really is just a r/wow echo chamber at this point.  Stop gatekeeping the game because you like to play it one way.  I rushed to 60, having a great time farming gold and bis items.  Just because I play differently doesn't mean that I'm wrong.

Bgs are phase 3
---
I mean, I've got classes every day aside from weekends and I'm still level 60 and pre-raid bis while still maintaining a high average in my classes. Just because someone has a life doesn't mean they can't already be level 60. Not to mention you can do basically any dungeon outside of UBRS before level 60 so that's not even a hard requirement.

Hey, a bit late, but author here! Thanks for the compliment, and I'm glad you found the guide useful. I have to warn though that my raiding experience is limited to Alliance side, so I can't guarantee it works for the OP, as he was planning to play orc.

Additionally, I don't play Classic, so I'm unaware if the guide works for it. If it does (or even if it doesn't!) I'll be happy to hear it and add whatever clarifications are needed to the guide.

The Booty Bay - Ratchet boat doesn't need to be any longer than it is.  It's like a herd of 10 year olds every time getting their kicks out of one-shotting someone 20 levels below them.  Also, as a Warlock boat rides are long enough as is since I have to go back and forth to the Barrens from the other continent just for quest runs.

so much for classic lasting. theyre releasing this shit WAYYYY too soon. like DM shouldnt have even been released till early next year at the EARLIEST

Who the hell throws Curse of Tongues on a warlock OMEGALUL
---
Personally speaking, I think Blizzard should play to it by ear rather than spacing it out arbitrarily.
---
The flow of phases should be based on how much of the population has actually been playing the previous phases content and how much they've been playing it.
---
I think # nochanges was always a pipe dream from the get go, its obvious when you look at players doing Onyxia in 15 man groups and farming the best possible gear easily with multiple guilds now farming multiple hands of ragnaros's. Sure we've got some outliers and top 1%ers but that just goes to show that the threshold for how fast we can all clear content has gone up through the roof.
---
Lets say in 2 months time there is a sizable amount of the playerbase that is decked out in MC gear BIS, you still want Blizzard to hold onto their pre-planned timeline? I don't see any reason Blizzard should artificially stagnate phases if a sizable chunk of players have run out of things to do and its ready to go.

That's a very niche and cherrypicked example because DM was meant to add more mp5 options for casters and you're playing the most mp5 dependent class. Most other casters will only get 2-4 prebis

P2 in February? It's been known for a while that p2 will come before 2019 is over.
---
&gt;It lets you know when you can cast abilities without interrupting your auto shot.

I thought this was a myth. As if even when I get "interrupted" I still see a white number appear. It was honestly after I noticed that, that my hunter lost a lot of its appeal.

Struggling with AOE tanking. Wanted to confirm the following from icy veins
---
&gt;Demoralizing Shout was bugged at the start of WoW Classic and generated too much threat, according to this Blizzard post. Its September 11th fix, as well as Battle Shout now generating threat equally on all enemies, rather than splitting among them, causes Battle Shout to be the superior skill to spam in order to gain and keep AoE threat on enemies, as it cannot be resisted like Demoralizing Shout can.
---
Nah. Abusing gearswap and server ticks is a thing.
---
I am not sure that many guilds in classic are using DKP but this could change in later phases. 
---
I could think of a few. Boss kills, new members, big moments (Legendary crafts), who got what loots when, when a boss was killed, rank on server compared to other guilds.
---
A hopeful new member might look for information on the guild such as requirements and their current progression or what they are looking for.
---
I guess it would save typing out stuff and answering questions when people ask about the guild.
---
If the prices are being driven down to vendor prices then maybe the items are fucking worthless.
---
DM changes 7 slots in my PreBIS or gives me other viable options.  I won't be running the other 60 dungeons nearly as much now and there will be less whining about my need roles off DM drops.
---
Yeah and I mean it may seem like not that large of an issue, but once battlegrounds and the honor system come out people will definitely be looking for it.
---
Thanks, appreciate the kind words! I'm pretty slow at leveling because of all the world pvp but I don't mind it because we haven't really gotten this kind of content since TBC probably. On retail it's all about getting to max level so you can start playing the game, in classic THIS IS the game haha. Looking forward to lvl 60 as well, I played a bit on a private server previously to try and figure out which class I wanted to play. Druid sure is an awesome class!
---
\*blasts Too Little Too Late by Jojo\*
---
you're right that it's not vanilla and i guess that may be why im so frustrated with this. I really wish we had the gear progression that vanilla had. I loved raiding in that jank ass gear on nost.
---
&gt;so the pre-raid gearing process is completly different. 
---
Wrong. For certain classes there might be a few items from DM but a majority of classes don't need many items if any from Dire Maul. So tired of seeing this excuse.
---
Didn't consider this, good point.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc0oaxj5P80

Starts around 0:45
---
I dont know why people are freaking out. Obviously if youre not even close to 60 yet you dont have to run Dire Maul. No one is forcing you. The release this early IS NOT FOR YOU. Its for the people who are ready to run it.
---
Depends on how strong of a character you have. Something like that would break someone with a weak will I would imagine. So as long as you have some strong ass mental fortitude you would be fine I guess?
---
haters gotta hate
---
"fellow seller"
---
You go and never bid on anything (or bid up items if you are underhanded and have the gold to back this tactic if it goes awry). Gold is evenly distributed among all participants after the run, so as long as you don‚Äôt buy an item, or spend less than the amount distributed at the end, you make money.
---
If the run has REALLY good drops, you can make bank. But sometimes you‚Äôll have a run full of poop and it won‚Äôt be very lucrative.
---
Or call a gm
---
Is this how it actually works for hunters in Vanilla? Because in BC you used a shot timer for steady shot but instant casts didn't interrupt your shot timer
---
Lol, I'm sure your kids will be better off when you cancel the holidays so you can play wow
---
Both OSRS and Classic WoW have trash combat. You play for other reasons.

I think there's just a ton of greens and blues you can get from there.  Some new recipies.

Sadly it‚Äôs true. You can fear us if we get in close and you beat us at the dot attrition game when we fight at range. Nothing wrong with a smart disengage.
---
Amazing world PvP for sure, but also no chance in hell leveling will be happening. I think a lot of people that aren't 60 before then may drop the game when their nights become trying to do 5 quests in under 3 hours.
---
I have a level frost 30 mage and I quest around with a friend who plays a level 30 affliction warlock.
---
Here are the main differences that I can see so far. At least in low level content. I don't know how it would translate to high levels. Note: this is all coming from a mage's perspective.
---
Mages do higher burst damage, but you will spend a lot of your time in a vulnerable drinking state to replenish your mana. There are some skills to refresh mana and cooldowns them, but those skills are on cooldowns themselves. You will likely kill something faster than a Warlock, but it wont be sustainable over a long period of time before you have to drink. Or you spread out your DPS to try and last longer by not spamming your rotations. But you will gradually still run out of mana. Get used to drinking a lot while your teammates either wait for you or they carry on and you have to run after them. At least you get unlimited water so its just a matter of waiting a few 20-30 seconds. Mages would be ungodly expensive in water costs to play if they didn't create their own.
---
Frost mages have some survivability because you can freeze opponents and encase yourself in ice if needed. However, mages are still fragile. You cannot take a lot of damage because you have a lesser HP pool than a Warlock, who converts their health to mana. Mages are often called "glass cannons". Warlocks get a pet demon to help tank mobs for them. I remember Frost mages get a water elemental, but I forget if that is in Classic/vanilla or if that was in a later patch or expansion.
---
Mages are fun in PVE and group PVP. It gets harder at least for me on 1v1 PVP because Mages dont have much HP. Therefore a fight with a Mage doesnt last long. You either blast your opponent apart before you die, or you're killed quickly because you cant take much damage. If you're in a group and someone else absorbs damage for you, then you'll have a great time blowing shit up. Or if you get really good with freezing, polymorphing, and crowd control in general you'll do pretty good.
---
Warlocks live longer typically, but their damage is averaged out over time and is in general lower than Mage. At least when it comes to single battles. After multiple battles, a Warlock would do more because they dont have to stop to drink as much. They use lifetap to replenish mana and then life drain and life siphon to replenish health. It gives you more uptime, but your HP can be vulnerable if you lifetap too much away.
---
All cosmetic pets/items are probably going to rise in value, I just don't see people shelling out 200G+ for an item that doesn't affect your character's strength until they're already geared.
---
Low level twink items will probably skyrocket when BG's come out in P3.
---
Potions/Consumables for later instances, e.g. Nature Resist is like 20-50s atm, but it will probably go up to 2g+ when the later instances come out.
---
True the 1% player base are definitely the casuals.
---
I think it is possible to do it under 15min with the proper lineup. ofc without flask etc.
---
Oh, wow, that's actually pretty cool! Thanks for the info :)
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
A nay-sayer could infer it as *"Population is dropping faster than expected, release new content to try and keep people in!"*
---
Layers and queues are down. It's hardly the end of the world, but I'd people don't think the population is slipping, they're crazy. Yes, plenty of big servers are still "Full" at primetime, but they're 5 - 30 minute queue full, not 2 - 6 hour queue full.

---
Not world first
---
I didnt mostly because I figured that it was unlikely for someone to be at around the same exact level range as me, on the same server, and in the same faction. Like I was hoping to find someone who was about to reroll another toon to join them on the grind to 60.
---
You want ravager, but at lvl 43 all time youll gain running cleave groups will be wasted farming ravager. You should maybe tank, which is doable with a 2h at that level.
---
The people mad about this being too early are people who are still 40-50. Sorry but for us who are pre-bis and locked out of ony/MC there‚Äôs not much to do and that‚Äôs a LOT of people. I‚Äôm super happy with this coming out next week
---
Dunno if it's just me, but a lot of the caster gear linked is only crit chance. While it is good. I wouldn't say it's all better than current options.
---
If you're an enchanter, you can disenchant green-quality items and above, even if theyre soulbound, to turn them into enchanting materials you can use to enchant gear or sell to other enchanters on the auction house. But if you're not an enchanter, your only choice is to vendor them.

Nope this is the same video and it doesn‚Äôt address the issue people are having. When creating a route...I hit add.  I name it. I chose the zone. Then under that there is nothing.  No data.
---
Maybe not a ton, but quite a few. Not saying that to make you feel slow or anything, just saying that DM isn‚Äôt going to change a whole lot as far as getting into MC. Better gear is always gonna help but a big part of raiding is coordination and skill. You could run in there with everyone decked out and still wipe on Lucifron over and over if you‚Äôre not coordinating who‚Äôs doing what and who‚Äôs handling dispels and all that.
---
20% is already extremely high, if you think it's higher than that you're delusional. I'm on a high population server and at any one time I can /who 60 (class) and most classes will have less than 50 on at any one time.
---
DM gear is definitely at the same level if not better than MC and Ony. It's just not a complete set.
---
I think there's a lack of common understanding of what 'hardcore' WoW players are. I personally think the majority of players don't level very efficiently and naturally lag behind others. Then there are some players that just know what to do to max out their XP/hr and get 60 before a lot of other people.  
---
&gt;But if you've been clearing MC so many times that you guys are all fully kitted out, fully geared, sitting around all bored, I daresay that most of the people in your guild, are the very same people who raced to 60 within the first, if not second week of release. 
---
As someone who played back in OG, I think the progression scaling is so much different in terms of average player skill and overall endgame raiding knowledge. Even the biggest guilds would take a bit of time to clear through Domo and Rag, but now people are literally just clearing in PuGs. Honestly there were probably trial periods of OG vanilla where we didn't even consider proper stats like attaining the PvE % Hitcap. 
---
&gt;  You cannot tell me, that just the average Joe/Jane who kinda logs in every now and then, does a few quests and logs off, doesn't touch the game for a few days, then logs back on for maybe 20 minutes, can do that. No way. 
---
I think the thing to compare here goes back to my first statement. In my head there are "hardcore", "Semi-Hardcore", "average", "casuals", "super-casuals".  The "average joe who logs in and does a few quests then logs off" is not the *average joe* in my head and probably isn't to a lot of people. I honestly believe that a player of that caliber is more in the casual to super-casual spectrum. 
---
Especially due to the fact that gear can start to be obtained from BRD as low as 52, You could easily spam nothing but instances with well versed people up through 60 and probably get geared out pretty good for pre-raid BiS.
---
Literally the only challenge to this is just level efficiency and beating the big wave of middling players so you don't have to compete for mobs as badly
---
Community is what you make of it.
---
It has been 6 weeks since release (approximately). It takes an average gamer about 10 days played to hit 60. That is 240 hours. Divide 240 hours by 6 and you get 40 hours a week. 
---
An average gamer who is 60 now has played about 40 hours a week. Sure some hit 60 with less than 5 days played, but the average gamer doesn‚Äôt. The bottom line is the average 60 now plays the game about the same as a full time job. 
---
Now I am not here to say I don‚Äôt play WoW. I have a 56 main and a 43 alt. If I focused on just one, I would be 60 already. But I wouldn‚Äôt call those who aren‚Äôt 60 casual. The hardcore gamers are 60 and raiding. The semi hardcore gamers are in their 50s or 60 and getting ready to raid. The casual gamers are in their 30s and 40s. 
---
Now if you define casuals as people playing less than 40 hours a week, then sure only casuals aren‚Äôt 60.
---
Plot twist its actually a dead paladin.
---
Too soon, Executives.
---
Ion, ex GM of Elitist Jerks, once again caters to the 1% of the playerbase, the ultra hardcore, and bases the release of content on them.
---
This does not bode well for the rest of the expansion.
---
What's gonna happen when the 1 percenters get bored of DM, world bosses, and PvP? Early release BWL. BWL will get facerolled the same day it will be released, so early Gates Of Ahn Qiraz and early AQ. This will screw up the entire game.
---
Leveling with no focus on anything but leveling speed ensures that *I* will burn out. Farting around and gaining exp aimlessly in the meantime is much more fun.
---
I have the same issue that isn‚Äôt being addressed it isn‚Äôt you.
---
\[Set the oven to Cataclysmic\]
---
More level 60 content literally doesn't affect people who are still leveling at all.
---
Sounds like people just want something to complain about.
---
This is more low effort than a lot of the shit that gets removed here
---
then... don't run dire maul?
---
jesus.
---
At that rate you won't be 60 until 2021.
---
Don't listen to this White Knight dude. Always someone got to come try and ruin a good moment. This is a great post.
---
And most of them won‚Äôt.
---
You should repurpose this as when they click my name for a party invite and see I'm a UD Rogue.
---
This happened to me and some friends, what we did is those of us higher level joined a better guild, but we all just join our own chat channel, have each other on friends list, and changed the chat channel color to something special. So basically we still have a guild chat, which is the only thing special about a guild in classic
---
Try flying from camp taurajo to brackenwall. FP will send you to crossroads, then back to camp T, then to Brackenwall. Shit is wack.
---
Better than two!
---
That makes sense. Thanks
---
I hav the profession. I am mining.
---
It's more accurate this way because DM came out before the Honor System.

My blacksmithing says yay. My mining and gold says boo.

Right click on the chat box TAB and go to settings. In the options you should be able to set your options in 3 tabs. 3rd tab should have options displayed like "gold collected", "profession skill" and such. Casting should be in there I believe.
---
That‚Äôs kinda a nebulous question.
---
For Enh shaman if you‚Äôre geared out the ass with weapons and have WF procs you‚Äôll wreck them.
---
As long as you use your grounding totems, earthbind, purge, rank 1 earth shock, shields, searing totems and all of your available tools well.
---
Elemental is insane burst and you can usually burst down someone with a few crits. But you don‚Äôt have sustain. Same thing as above with all the totems/purge and stuff. MUCH easier PVP spec. Can wreck if you‚Äôre good.
---
Resto is hard af to kill. Great healer in group PVP due to chain heal.
---
Point is, they can be good, but your tremor totem has to be laid at proper times, interrupt proper times, grousing totem proper times and so on.
---
What spec would i wanna go for leveling an ALT Warlock?

I feel personally targeted but tbh wow classic is the highlight of some days so I‚Äôll keep playing it like a second job because I‚Äôm enjoying myself.
---
Hi, a bit late, but author here! I think the bit about Hamstring might not have been clear enough, so I went back and edited that part to make it clear.
---
What I said is that, playing as Alliance and without Windfury (which is what my raiding experience is limited as, and the perspective from which I wrote the guide), one would not have enough rage to spare *and* justify fishing for procs with Hamstring. At the very least, that was my experience when I tried playing that way. I do understand it's a valid way when playing Horde, which is what you intended at the time of making this threat.
---
I'll admit I'm not the best player for Warrior so my understanding can be completely faulty, and I don't play Classic so the information in my guide might not be applicable there. My main intention was to provide the community with a central document that everyone could consult about playing 2H Warrior, as there was none before. If something is wrong or it's different in Classic, I'm happy to hear any corrections and suggestions.
---
During cata right?
---
Yeah exactly.
---
Nothing. Discord + google form/sheets is all we need.
---
at least on the plus side you're prob already really good at letting all the comments roll off your back
---
I‚Äôm sorry this is such a hard concept for you to understand.  I tried my best to explain it to you, but you‚Äôre either just not that clever or you‚Äôre just an asshole.
---
Because when he said he was rolling horde, thousands of people followed to play with him.
---
If maintaining the sub of one outspoken person with heavy insight into his game time and desires will keep 2000 more people playing, and by extension, 4000 due to the networking effect, and so on.
---
I think Dire Maul early is a bad decision, but I can see why it was done.  (It also feelsbadman to not have paladin/lock mounts)
---
The power of classic is that there are few to no progression gates, but this also allows people playing 18 hours a day to run out of things to do.
---
The ironic part is that those people actually had 18h per day of content already, but that would require a realistic evaluation of reality.  Not something likely to come from someone spending 18h per day in a game.
---
Every capital has a natural chain:

---
DM comes out next week.
---
Your reply is useful and should be upvoted by the whole world.  People should make multiple accounts just to upvote how fucking awesome you are.
---
Can we as a community have some sort of input into these decisions going into the future?  Everyone was completely on board with DM coming out at the end of the year.  Now its coming out 1.5 months after release.  At this rate we will have Naxx by April.  
---
Everyone I know is level 50 or below.  I do not understand where this *"everyone is running out of content"* is coming from.  If Blizzard is using streamers who do not have jobs &amp; play 24/7 as the metric to release content that is not a good indicator.
---
 But at least it's not locked behind x number of days of unmissed dailies.
---
rogue killing someone:
---
stun, cooldown ticking, time for 2nd stun, guy used free action pot - pop another cd (evasion), ok im getting really unlucky time to reset - sprint, reset, stealth back, reopen, guy is spamming /rude, whatever kill's a kill
---
shaman killing someone:
---
WINDFURY CRIT BICKITY BAM JAJAJA
---
I pretty consistently give away low level enchants in SW and have no problem finding takers. I got about 3g in tips the other day. Even 60s were getting them.
---
It sounds like you think that the warlock epic is free. It still is 500+ gold depending on market price of the mats. And plus the quest for it is kind of a pain in the ass.
---
And like many people have said it doesnt take 30 hours to farm 1k gold. I made my mount money very easily one weekend playing the AH.
---
Is it good? I could never get into any other MMO like Guild Wars.
---
I'm a casual-player. I just wanna do some quests, talk to friends, experience the environments and the lore - I'm not into the whole min/max leveling and gearing.
---
yes they had. They originally had 4 phases planned and the entire community was stating that wasn't enough. It wasn't just streamers
---
Looking for an Alliance guild on Pagle that raids a bit late night (9pm+), preferably during weekdays. The guild I was in is merging with another and their new raid time is too early for me.
---
I'm a lv45 Rogue, but I think I can put more hours in and rush to 60 in a couple of weeks.
---
wtf why just diremaul and not phase 2
---
You had 15 years to fix this blizz!
---
If it was on the same time table, the war effort would start next October. I would expect it will probably be a little faster, yes.
---
Did a bunch back in TBC and Wrath. They can be lucrative. If you don‚Äôt mind the lockout on the toon, if you are geared already, you can effectively be a carry. Everyone else is auctioning off loot and you‚Äôll be paid out for the carry at the end. Basically selling a run.
---
Lol, how is it useless? Most classes get a few pieces of gear that are upgrades from previous pre-bis. 
---
Join the circle jerk
---
42 isn't it?
---
So 1008 hours worth of time.
---
264 hours of played time.
---
Call it 6 hours a day of played time since launch. Could very easily do that with a full time job and still getting plenty of sleep.
---
Stop lying. You replied to me specifically and said that he mattered to "one of us, and it's not me".
---
It generates aoe threat tho.
---
Ah, I see. The WoW killer.
---
He'd do anything for love
---
but he won't do that
---
Hey - I‚Äôve been having a blast tanking on my warrior - I plan on tanking dungeons when im 60 to acquire my pre-raid stuff.
---
Question: Imp Demoralizing Shout worth anything in 60 dungeons? Couldnt find anything online concerning bosses‚Äô AP
---
question is what else should i look for now
---
Feel you, bro...
---
Mouse buttons
---
Most guilds have a blacklist. Most community servers won't have one because it's pretty much whichhunting on a he said she said basis. All those lists accomplish is a causality loop between silly people, and their drama.
---
Yeah, druid stealth in, cheetah out, then bear to tank and cap is ideal. But we gotta keep the MT happy and bring him to some BGs too!
---
 **Region EU - Faction Horde - Server Type PVP**
---
\[H\] Golemagg - 
---
Hey!
---
We are a few solid friends (around 7 of us) who were abandoned by  around 30 or so other friends who had planned to play classic - we‚Äôre  sat in a guild all alone! A few of us have been playing since classic  launch all the way through to now.
---
We‚Äôre just a bunch of nice people hanging out. We‚Äôre all in our 30‚Äôs  and cant be bothered with drama or nonsense! We don‚Äôt know where this  classic adventure will lead us - but we know with more it‚Äôs better!
---
Our level ranges from 20-60 right now.
---
So if you are alone and fancy a nice play to hang out - to chat and relax - whisper.
---
We love Instances - a lot.
---
Just be a nice person who wants a place nice to make new friends.
---
/w Edna, Filch, Metalhawk or Jalex in game. or DM me.
---
&gt; Releasing Dire Maul a week from now is way too soon.
---
I especially like the part where you provide a statement with absolutely nothing to back it up.
---
just ignore them, it's pure jealousy that us mages are gold making machines and have infinite free food and water.
---
I need to meet some players like that
---
Whatever will be, will be.
---
Like a surplus of supply will lower prices, to where providing said resources is no longer profitable?
---
It's not simply "more" content, although it is that. Dire Maul has a lot of loot that bridges the gap for cloth wearers. There's a huge no mans land of good loot for casters before tier 1, and dire maul fixed that in vanilla. I'm guessing blizzard wanted to get DM out sooner to eliminate that problem before people simply outlevel the gear
---
Our friend.
---
Watch out, I said almost the same thing and the shit got removed, but yeah he is a garbage human
---
104 days is almost closer to 4 months than 3...
---
Biased much?
---
classic was never for the casual
---
go back to retail.
---
Its really not a good idea in my books, as I too have a full time job and cannot play all day every day.
---
I'm just repeating back what you said to me.  If you want to get mad at someone get mad at yourself for being a carebear who rolled on a pvp server.
---
I know a paladin when I see one he's 100% one.
---
F1-F4 have always been my longer CD buttons.
---
Mid 20s? I thought it was all young kids trynna be bad bois.
---
Yeah, I left a bunch out because I felt many had less affect than laying.
---
Good thing I just hit level 30üò©üò©üôÑüôÑ
---
Well...they pretty much auction things for you. TSM will scan the auction house, compare the value against vendor price to determine if it's worth posting, and then undercut the lowest seller. All you have to do is press scan, and then press post.
---
Do people just guess what level the majority playerbase is or is there a way to know for sure?
---
Layering increased supply.
---
&gt; Clearly a large number of subs dropped off after the first month
---
People who powered through 6 months of content in two weeks will not care about one additional instance. They might as well cater to the loyal playerbase who are happy to sub for a long time to play the game as is.
---
Alienating players like me who would have subbed for years to get some of the fickle players to sub for an additional month is not a smart move.
---
&gt; Stop being mad that people level faster than you
---
I installed Warcraft on launch day in 2004 and was 9 days /played (220+ hours) when I dinged 60, this time I will do it in 3. I'm not doing any of the adventuring I did then or making friends and I already feel like I am cheating myself. I'm basically just bee-lining to max level which is not what classic was about. That race to max level is what retail players are used to. That's why these players are leaving. There's no dailies for max level players in Classic.
---
If anything releasing DM is better for casuals since they can now have access to DM for leveling and catchup gear.
---
Lol I guess it was both.
---
I'm a level 35 arms warrior, mainly dps but tanking in dungeons.
---
When should I prioritize +strengh over +armor?
---
In my example, is it worth replacing 200 armor with +8 str (and +8 stam)?
---
You need to comprehend what you read better instead of accuse people of lying.  
---
When I said "The difference is that one of us thinks it does, and I don't" the "one of us" I was referring to was the streamer guy, not you.
---
It's not all about you, man.
---
Atlasloot addon tells you exactly that :)
---
As a fellow rogue, be aware: if you want a group, be ready to make your own.
---
Most groups don't want a rogue because they: already have one, have a dps warrior, have a feral druid, have a hunter, have a warrior tank who doesn't want to roll against a rogue on what gear they want, or a host of other reasons.
---
Rogues are very consistent dps, especially as combat. They happen to have a lot of gear overlap with other classes especially at 60 dungeon level, and are hugely populated.
---
I decline tips tbh, it doesn‚Äôt cost me fuck all just feels dirty
---
&gt; Esfand's streams
---
Would you mind being more specific?  I don't watch those...did he say that he and Blizzard were in communication about this?
---
Can't priests :/
---
You don't need the content this early.  You.  As a singular.  
---
I'm more than happy to swap from farming zombies to farming dire maul.
---
I used elvui on retail, didn't know they had it for classic too!! Thank you!
---
I got 2 parts of the defias set so far. Nice :) Good luck with your future dungeon runs!
---
I'm on that server, what makes those chat groups worse than other servers?
---
Definately not, it will lose you money.
---
Am that warlock, no shame
---
You're going to run outta mana quick if you're doing regrowth and rejuv before every pull
---
He could of done all that without seeking attention though. It‚Äôs like the people who film themselves giving money to the homeless or posting on social media that you‚Äôre donating to a charity. You can do kind acts without seeking for ‚Äúkudos‚Äù from random strangers on reddit.
---
No waaaaay! I saw someone today with that name on Flamelash. Didn't know i had to read it backwards. Wasn't that you?
---
I mean he or she or they are only doing their BiS way to play the game.
---
So which race is your choice in classic and why ?
---
Riiight.
---
Yesterday, i was riding and i saw a lvl 40 running, i /lol at him,  he sent me a pm full of insult and ignored me, i guess i Will keep the 20 gold i was about to give him for his mount.
---
They also gave hunters the ability to kite well, still got banned for kiting racial leaders
---
just finished leveling 3rd alt to 60 how much more do i need to lvl before theres more to do in the game ?
---
What the hell I'm level 26 :-)
---
I can attest to this as I just got a classic subscription because of how bad the unchained public test is.
---
Absolutely
---
Yeah, pretty much right.
---
You care way too much about this.
---
But mr smite only does stun at 2/3 and 1/3 health doesn't he? Couldn't you kill the stealthed elites first?
---
That's kind of how some guilds have done recruiting. It's not like we would have disenchanted loot over giving it to a player trying out for the guild but that's the only way they were getting any.
---
Get 3 mages and aoe grind SM
---
There‚Äôs no such thing as a fully automated AH addon due to limitations in the Lua API that Blizz expose to addons. BUT, they are automated to some extent in that they search for prices and automatically calculate the undercut price. Again, not sure why you would be against that.
---
Perhaps.  I was just screwing around, running through and killing stuff.  Figured I'd try the same with him &amp; it didn't work out.
---
Dore maul fills a nice little gap 50 to 60
---
False
---
This is our friend
---
People with no control over any aspect of their real life. Steamrolled by bosses and nagged by family. They only have this one outlet to exercise power over someone so they do, without empathy. It‚Äôs the same kind of person who is nasty to servers at restaurants.
---
You killed him after right?
---
sorry its BOP.  
---
hmmm... maybe get him a twink item? some of the bis rogue twink items are still cheap (ish)
---
If I needed drops anyway that's not a bad deal.
---
Boss is kill
---
Yes, loot 
---
yeah no reason to hard cap people because some are not there yet. if the top group quits you don t need to release content again if the next group is geared well because they are not the majority again.
---
if you are level 30 running around in sm because you have wife kids and a job (or all the other things people list) there is no reason to complain because the added content wil not impact you for an other 2+ monts until you hit 60. 
---
it s a question which group you build the releases around. the guys playing 50h+ a week or the guys playing 5h a week. pretty sure you need much less 50h+ guys to make the server feel populated and alive then 5h guys. the moment the server feels dead the 5h guys quite aswell because they have a wife, kids and a job and no time to search for an hour for every group :-)
---
That‚Äôs completely fair. The warlocks in my guild farmed most of the mats easily and are splitting the cost of the 250G.  Everyone has a different situation.  
---
I would disagree. You think the average person makes more than 33G and hour consistently? Players farming Mara can do 35-45 easily and that is considered really good.  
---
Mind telling me what you did in one weekend to earn 1K gold in less than 30 hours? If it‚Äôs a BoE drop, then that‚Äôs not normal or can be relied on.
---
Once.
---
All raids reset on Tuesdays.
---
&gt;you can do MC with level 57's in blues *except for the tank, off tank and main healers*
---
FTFY.
---
I tried that today on MC and rolled a fucking 16 ._.
---
I think you‚Äôre the 1% people are claiming that this release is pandering to.
---
I realize that a majority of players aren't 60 but its really annoying to see people complain that we're getting more content. I've been looking forward to DM since Classic came out because I knew it'd have the rank 7 conjured water and Warlock/Paladin Epic mounts.
---
Only thing I really want now is the keyring.
---
If on a pvp realm and he likes to pvp, farm some dust elementals for the sleep dust. Give him a couple stacks of those and he'll have a ball with them in the world.
---
You cant expect him to take you off of ignore, hes committed now.
---
Have you been buying or farming?
---
I sold 10 during my spree for epic mount and I have 35 in the bank that I've picked and I thought I was doing well. 
---
If even half of these are yours that you picked, you sir are insane.
---
Wishing for the death of others is pretty assholy.
---
DM is coming out before p2 release. More specifically, on the 15th. You should use google before making snarky comments.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc0oaxj5P80
---
I do it back to people or people in their guild. If I haven't seen them before then I won't.
---
Are hunter traps visible to opposing faction? Or after/during a duel?
---
Have a 60 lock, 47 mage and 29 hunter - never get bored, well I get bored on my mage because it‚Äôs just so much drinking for 40 seconds..
---
If you get a fast weapon as a hunter (say like 2.8), do you just cast Aimed Shot the second it comes off cooldown, and ignore autoshots more?
---
Both bindings have around a 3% drop rate.
---
So a \~0.1% chance both drop in the same run.
---
I‚Äôm on windsong or something like that. It‚Äôs EST. 
---
Main is horde but I‚Äôve been playing more ally with friends who are on now. 
---
Hmu if you join
---
Take a screen shot of your /played and post it here please so we can end this argument
---
Ok, but you're wasting your own time in the process. 
---
The entire thought process of "PvP is good for farming b/c I can kill my competition" is baffling to me. 
---
In the end, both parties end up losing.
---
54 spriest. 
---
My rotations are usually, 1) shield 2) SW:P 3) mind flay x 2 4) mind blast then wand.
---
yeah but big shoulders
---
It does though.
---
"i dont enjoy playing casually"
---
I see people say that and I dont understand it? You only enjoy the game when it's causing issues in your life? You can only play if you cancel all plans and spend all your free time playing?
---
Classic just tests your social skills much more often than retail. That's what you are seeing.
---
There are more chances to have good interactions (which is what you see posted on here) but also more chances to have bad ones as well.
---
Basically the whole feel/purpose of the BG, to be honest. 
---
It was designed as a PvP zone, and then was launched as a PvP BG. They slowly did away with all the elements from its "zone" design
---
Not even 60 yet reeee
---
Not even close to true.
---
The loot whoring fucks are a little aggravating. I'm friendly enough that if someone wanted to farm an item that we both want I'd stay with the group until we both had it. Sware on me mum. The whole "no physical damage classes" stipulation for forming, for example, Princess groups is fucking obnoxious to watch constantly tick by in LFG channel.
---
I can't wait until Classic rapidly starts to catch up to retail, and they go too far, and the player base wants Classic 2 for vanilla again.
---
Are all current BIS PVE items from the likes of BRD, Scholo, UBRS, LBRS, etc unaffected by the dungeons that will come out over the next few phases? I.e, since I‚Äôm guessing most new upcoming releases are raids the pre-raid BIS shouldn‚Äôt change much right? 
---
Thank you to whoever answers this Q!!
---
...cough...*Pristine Black Diamonds*...cough...
---
&gt;	more than likely playing the AH
---
i wish i was, imagine buying all these diamonds for 1gold and sell them for 30. i think these guys have a lot of them because i saw a lot of these diamonds on ah
---
I have come to the conclusion that you are absolutely correct! I had to brush up on my combinatorics and retackle the problem from basic principles. Here's what I did: there are 96 * 5! permutations that form a sequence. And there are 100^5 total permutations. So that gives us 1/868,055 as the odds of getting a sequence, which is what you had. thank you for helping me!
---
People did this to me with the Troll quest in STV for the leaders up in the northern camp. I ended up begging for invite and they ignored me and I ran in and solo the boss, killed him as he killed me and they had to wait for the respawn. Wasn't a cross faction thing but I feel ya!
---
Don't be so hard on Blizzard, their trying they're best :P
---
&gt;Are hunter traps visible to opposing faction? 
---
&gt;Or after/during a duel?
---
Not during a duel.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between people paid to play and hardcore. You‚Äôd know that but you have ‚ÄúFILTHY CASUALS‚Äù syndrome
---
Yea, but I‚Äôve never had problems sustaining soul stones while farming it and they are free lol.
---
This needs more recognition. World pvp battles will be worth more than pride in phase 2.
---
You're right.
---
MY apologies. It will take you guys less than 8 hours after release to have all the gear from DM and an extra 400g before people start demanding "BWL When?!" I forgot you've all been running that for the past 8 years straight 20 hours a day since nost. Its not that you'll get bored, its that you have min-maxed farming the content so well that its irrelevant what content is available.

What evidence do you have that they did this because of him?
---
Some flippant video he releases doesn't send professional engineers skipping across an office to follow his every whim.
---
This was likely in the works before anyone made a WoW is dying video. If not, it was likely not Blizzard, but Activision forcing a corporation-first move instead of following a researched schedule. They could have models that predict this actually is a great move for the game or business that we do not know.
---
Either way, the picture you paint of Blizz employees getting together around some asshole streamer and listening to him like gospel is disrespectful to the developers of the game.
---
Ok... 3 and a half months, doesn‚Äôt change my point
---
I went PvP because I want choice. I definitely did not went PvP to PvP. I think that PvP in WoW is stupid.
---
No, holy shit is an expletive made by hunters when rets are allowed to need on Ash'kandi.

check the date, that's a custom video made this afternoon

Onyxia is on a wacky 5 day reset schedule. So the day of the week it resets will constantly change.

Whats a good addon for dps and threat display? Only addon I use currently is questie but I'm absolutely open to recommendations
---
Ngl, until a week ago, I thought the deposit for the auction (the one that is displayed when making an auction) is basically the fee for posting something on the AH. Only after I've actually read an AH mail  (and the wiki afterwards) I realised that you get the deposit back if the auction is successful.
---
So yes, there are people who don't know.
---
Madman. Could you elaborate on where/what mobs you were grinding at which levels?
---
I mean if you can't down rag in all greens are you even good?
---
Right, because giving up a lvl 60 so you can spend 1 month behind the curve on another server competing against twinks in bg's while you level sounds like a super fun thing to do.
---
Who would chose it? People who want to play the game, not get into open world dick measuring contests killing eachother back and forth, over and over. 
---
I understand the appeal of pvp, it's for the competitive type. But you need to understand that not everyone wants to deal with that.
---
Imp retty sure it doesn't cause you pet is kinda like a character of his own and doesnt have your talents. If for example a talent says "give your pets this bonus" then yeah your pet will have it but otherwise its only for you character himself.

WRONG. Ony has a 5 day reset timer. MC has a 7 day reset timer that starts/ends on Tuesday. Ony is just a rolling 5 day.

They have a rez. One you can cast during combat (only class that can do that). It just has a CD of 30min.
---
Personally having a blast on mine (level 30 only tho, but I've tanked and healed several dungeons)
---
You were totally right! I should have stuck with permutations the whole way through; there was a miscounting when I tried to do unordered reasoning just like you said. Thanks :P
---
Why are you bee-lining it? Again. stop with the fomo bullshit and play the game you want to play. That's why classic exists and is amazing, because you could never hit 60, put in 300 hours, and still be having a blast the whole time.
---
Also it has nothing to do with "what retail players are used to". Racing to max has always been a thing. It's a different playstyle than other people, but it's just as valid as taking your time doing random other shit that a lot of other people would consider a total waste of time.
---
This sub is filled with people trying to act like they're being forced to play one way or another, and that's simply not true. They're just forcing themselves to play in a way they apparently don't enjoy, for no reason. This isn't new and exciting content. You're not missing anything by not being max level, and this shit can wait.  If they released Naxx tomorrow, it would still be there in two years when you felt like doing it.
---
I was at like 16d played when I finally hit 60 because (other than just afk time from queue dodging etc) I love doing stupid shit like spending hours wandering around low level alliance areas mind control buffing people or finding other shenanigans to get up to, and I knew by the time I hit 60 there would still be the same shit to do.
---
I think so.
---
Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby
---
lol if it goes to vendor price then that means no one wants to really buy it so why are you mad?
---
Poor guy
---
made my day, didnt think you'd deliver. thank you.
---
Lvl 40 mount is 60%, lvl 60 mount is 100%
---
It blows me away the perspective people have on this sub. From the way people talk about it, you would think everyone playing Classic WoW is playing 40 hours/week or more. I mean, I get that this community is gonna be a bit more dedicated than the average player, but come on...
---
Holy pally doesn't use tier / plate until bwl /Naxx
---
Now is not the time to be leveling a new toon on a PvP server with phase 2 being so close. Unless you are really into PvP that is.
---
I agree. Person who is giving the items over opens trade. They're the ones who have to get their ducks in a row, I wouldnt want to throw a trade screen in their faces, or seem impatient.
---
Well obviously. That's a good thing though. You should want for all servers to get to 1 layer. Layers are bad.
---
Nah. Made an offhand remark, nothing more. You didn't have to come in with the "same about you" thing and then get all worked up over nothing.
---
I helped a 35 human warrior do the escort quest in desolace the other day on my orc shaman.  He was very grateful.
---
that's a name i haven't heard in years lmao
---
More so PVE. I like raiding, dungeons, questing, and farming. PVP is a side game to me.
---
I'd say in the beginning you really don't want too much mitigation. It'll lower your rage received since less damage received, and you need to be able to deal some decent to maintain threat at that level. Stack the STR and Stamina.
---
i'm the paladin of the miss ergo a warrior
---
You claim to have been the undercover hero of the story you told, but all we have to go on is your word that you were just protecting the people who you believe hastily chose greed (you still didn't prove this was ninja looted).  
---
Did you ask them why they chose greed?  Are you sure they actually cared about the loot?  I didn't see any "OMG!!! NINJA LOOTERS I NEEDED THAT PATTERN TOO!!! RE-ROLL!" in your chatlog.  Seems like chasing free karma and wanting the people of Reddit to validate your personal desire to be seen as a "good guy" or victim IMO.  But in the end...  I don't know, so who cares?
---
Him sitting means crit? Wtf?

some people suck

Oh ok. I only get the overpower ‚Äúaura‚Äù pop up when it procs in battle stance though so I assumed it never procs otherwise.
---
Where's your dagger with +30spell power
---
Appealing to the noob player base is what made retail, no one wants to wait for 2 hour a day players who afk and beat their meat for half that to get to 60 in a year before we get new content
---
Hints -
---
1)allow class rolls on T1 BoEs 
---
2)MS&gt;OS for other loot
---
3)for fiery cores and other reagent BoEs just roll 1-40 and give to whoever's in that slot. 
---
For example fiery core drops and you roll 1-40 resulting in an 11. You give to the 11th raid member which is first player in group 3.
---
That way you dont have to look through 40 rolls every BOE drop
---
I don't know what level the ultra try-hards say, but I know for a fact I did it as low as level 42 way back when.
---
Still, it isn't usually linear. Twice the supply of crystals doesn't necessarily halve the price.
---
The fact that Blizzard has cracked and are releasing this early just to try and keep people in makes me think that they are worried about player numbers waning. I wonder if this will set a precedent for other premature releases of content going forward or if they are still adamant on keeping to the original release plan.
---
gold and ring
---
There goes the economy.  It was already screwed thanks to layering, now with DM tribute runs it's going to blow right up.
---
Drop rate is like 0.02
---
yep. this is smart on blizz to release while everyone is lvling
---
i mean i would be fine running that group, itll never drop anyway who cares lol. I guess if i had a 2nd option straight away i wouldnt but i wouldnt count it either way.

Dude not for nothing, but people who actually know the AH flip game aren't gonna share their secrets with you. That defeats the entire purpose.

That's alright, you only have to make it to like level 40 to get some +hit gear :/
---
LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yea but you could run that dungeon all day every day until you quit and possibly never get it. A frostsaber you eventually will get it.
---
Oh I never realized this. Cool.
---
I was more after unofficial predictions tbh, what would you like?
---
Stun resist makes orc arguably the best Horde choice for warlock. Orc is considered the best choice for any class it can be.
---
That being said I still made my warlock undead.
---
So you had MC on farm in 2-3 weeks.. but you weren't nolifing wow?
---
Come on man, weak semantic argument aside, I actually don't have a problem with nolifing it.
---
I have a problem with people who nolife it *and then complain there's not enough content*. Funny how you accuse me of strawmanning your argument while doing exactly that. nice.
---
I want a whole heck of a lot of changes to classic, including extra content patches and faster cycles. But I'm not surprised I'm not getting it.
---
Why 16?
---
This is probably going to be buried by now, but a few things:
---
I don‚Äôt think anybody is EXPECTING you to tank, everybody just really WANTS you to tank. Whitemane seems to be pretty stale on tanks that aren‚Äôt already pre-bis, so waiting an hour spamming in chat doesn‚Äôt make anybody happy. The MC raid I did yesterday had well over 10 warriors for damage. They can beat mages if geared and played properly.
---
You have plenty of time to make an alt if you want to. Both this week and last week‚Äôs MC runs have been recruiting people just to have the bodies. Yesterday we were running with 35 people because we couldn‚Äôt find anymore, and ~10 of those were 59,58,57,56 just to have extra bodies. 
---
You will find a MC group next month. You will find a MC group in 3 months. You will find a MC group in 6 months. And hey if you don‚Äôt start raiding until Naxx is out, chances are most of the loot from ZG, BWL, MC  will be open for you to take, and you skip months of grinding the same raids every week.
---
My priest has LMB bound as MC.
---
Don't ask.
---
Best to be at least two people for that quest. I did as druid with a rogue companion, and it was pretty doable.
---
Pros and cons. I didn't say it was all bad, that's definitely a positive.
---
This does need to happen and no one is paying attention to it. AV and WSG should be released in Phase 2. On top of that, casual PVP'ers will get discouraged very quickly when they play against players who clear BWL quickly, effectively doubling (more powerful) epic acquisition for elitists.
---
Yeah the GM assumed that he just mis-clicked when in fact he did not haha.
---
.......no, it doesn't seem odd that since people already have P1 raids on farm that they're releasing some content quicker.
---
Blizzard Employees: "Sir! I just got word that one of our hardcore players are quitting the game!"
---
"Let me make a few calls..."
---
I do sometimes, especially if the market is flooded with that item, I'm gonna undercut just to get rid of the one item clogging my inventory.
---
Too soon. All this to appease the minority who don't have lives. I wish Blizzard would go to the community about content release dates. I'm sure a much greater percentage of players is still levelling.
---
Yeah I feel like I play a lot and I'm just getting some good pre-raid gear in my mid 50s. Probably still a couple weeks away from doing MC for the first time. And I still have an alt I want to level a bit. They shouldn't be pacing this stuff based on the small percentage of no lifers. There's a huge amount of casuals that will still be a couple months from doing this and they'll feel overwhelmed/left behind if all raids are out and theyre still running BRD.
---
I couldn't choose it the second time, I had to choose it the third time :P
---
But yeah, I do understand what you mean, and that wasn't the point of the post at all. The point was that enough people obviously got butthurt (no pun intended) by the name "buttstuff" that they reported it, which I find incredibly weird and funny, but "mikehuntswet" stood alone for years with no repurcussions.
---
The thing with "buttstuff" is that, IMO at least, it isn't anything wrong with it. But it's all inuendos, which, if you start to ban for that, even the name "stick" could be banned, cus it could mean "dick" right. But hey, I don't make the rules, and nor does anyone here, so hey, here we are :P
---
yeah but its 800g lol
---
Can't you just right click it and turn it off?
---
You can still vendor the gems/ore.
---
And the vast majority of DM:E farming is lashers who drop greys which sell for 50s~.
---
The inflation comes from grey item vendoring.
---
&gt; what's that HS queue/cancel  thing?
---
Nah I‚Äôm hitting 60 this weekend so they should release phase 2 then.
---
How do you see .4 of an item?
---
If you go ele look for stam/spellpower/int. In that order. Enhance you go stam/str/agi in that order. I say stam first for both because the more stam you have you are generally harder to kill. A lot of the gear for enh bis is leather so you're kinda squishy. With ele a lot of your bis is cloth so you're even squishier. Ele hits like a God damn truck from far away pretty consistently. Where enhance is very random but if your wind fury crits you blow up whoever you are fighting almost instantly. I prefer enh over ele personally because I love the bigass axes swings in someone's face fucking them up. If you like lightning bolts and magic go ele. If you like swinging an axe in to some smooth brain skulls enhance is where its at
---
Alright maybe I'm discounting that too much. Was thinking wotf would be much better.
---
you master loot the boss, thats why people announce reserve ahead of time to let you know itll be master looted.
---
I thought a Lock couldn't life tap beyoned 1 hp. Maybe I'm crazy.
---
Are GDKP runs usually silent bids or posted bids?
---
I fear Blizzard is relapsing back into their retail habits. This is way way way too early, like 2 months too early. I'm really worried they are going to rush the progression to cater to the influencers.
---
8
---
They are panicking since classic is losing players fast, so this is is their reaction on it.
---
If enough sellers are happy to get 4g from the item, 4g is the reasonable market price.
---
To use a real world analog, if a new competitor can offer widgets at 50% your price you don't complain to them that they're too cheap. You either cut costs, offer more service, or move markets.
---
TBC+ would be easiest path. Classic+ would be harder. No word.
---
3 weeks at 40 hours a week=120 hours, or 5 days /worked. 
---
3 weeks to 60 meant that you absolutely were playing it like a job lol.
---
Hmm. You could talk to your tank about pulling the mobs further back? It's a little extra work, dunno if the debuff is worth it...
---
That's fair. I think the whole "title" of other players is entirely subjective and completely up to context. If someone only plays maybe an hour or two in a three day period then anyone that fits in the raid-level tier of players is probably considered a hardcore raider.
---
If the standard for somebody is: casually playing videogames for a 1-3 hours a day and has a decent sense for leveling efficiency, then they're naturally gonna get higher level than people who dally around awhile. Someone in this tier totally depends on their internal mindset and how they compare themselves to others. 
---
I have considerably less time played on my Hunter and i'm currently 51 and i started like a week and a half after release. I play a lot, but I have no real intent on raiding in the endgame unless it's incredibly opportune for my schedule on the given night. I consider myself like...a 5.5 or 6 out of 10 on a scale of hardcore for this game. 
---
Overall idk, I think it really just depends on the person and their own personal viewpoint on where they are mentally with everything.
---
As a priest I actually don't mind topping off warlocks, as long as the warlocks taps before going out of combat I'll toss them a renew because I started drinking right after so it doesn't hurt. 
---
It's the warlocks who tap to 1% before we pull and im still sitting there drinking and i know the mobs aoe so i gotta stop drinking in order to shield/heal them.
---
Probably depends on server. Also I was more referring to high lvls ganking. Not the total number of questers.
---
But.... why?
---
I was in Ulda excited to become an expert enchanter. Finally got there and it turns out it's 5g to learn. I had just bought my mount so only had 2g. Guildmate gave me 4. Bought whatever I could. Paid him back 4g the next day, and about 10 free enchantments since. Only now have I begin charging break even costs just so I don't go completely broke.
---
Edit:word
---
classic magetard
---
No one can tell you what you want to play.
---
Highly doubt it mate. Mobs level and type effect loot tables etc to my knowledge
---
Your proposition is that the vanilla wow economy wasn't broken post Diremaul release.
---
By "broken" I mean "gold quickly devalues into being nearly worthless".
---
If you don't want for rage generation, invite a pally/shaman/warlock/SPriest/arcane tank.
---
Lol as some one pointed out, no one is going to give you that information when they spent time themselves learning and finding out what is worth to stock for different phases.
---
The way you word your sentences makes me think you are 12 anyway so I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
My main is a mage and I can‚Äôt imagine playing another class that has to deal with mana personally
---
Wanderlust
---
Man I can‚Äôt get this axe to sell for the life of me. It‚Äôs in such a terrible spot, right as most players are super poor because of mounts, and it‚Äôs outdone by level 50 dungeon blues so no one uses it end game. I have it up for 50g bid 75g buy this last weekend with no bites, the AH cost of putting it up is quickly adding up and I‚Äôm so damn close to just disenchanting it or giving it to an alt.
---
Even as a human there are plenty of places where you sit on a chair and the table is at the level of your eyes.
---
yea smart ass and it is banned period. Does not matter where or how you communicated
---
Yes, but we don't know if the ai will behave same way as on pservers. Good example is Princess in Mara for instance - on classic she behaves differenclty.
---
DM is literally a catch up mechanic. Casuals mad. Sense not found.
---
That's a lie
---
I don't really give a shit either way about Dire Maul being added, I just think it's impressive to work 55 hours a week and still be able to put I would think at least 20+ a week into a single video game without it affecting any other aspect of your life.  And in either trying to frame it as "it didn't really take much" isn't very accurate unless you somehow managed to level to 60 and get pre-raid BIS in like 4 days played.
---
Boy I bet you feel a fool right now.
---
Lookup dark pact builds. They revolve around using succubus as mana battery as she has good dps. Disable her skills tho. .. Make sure to google for wand progression and 5 second rule.
---
I‚Äôm in a very similar situation. Just think of all that sweet rested xp you rack-up
---
Given that he immediately reversed his choice as soon as the relationship ended it seems pretty clear that the pressure for him to quit was coming from her and not because it's something he actually wanted.
---
Whether or not the amount of time he plays is healthy is something we'd need more info to determine.

---
5% from the farmhands. I had a friend who used to farm them and AH them for a tidy profit.
---
edit: Downvoted for providing information? That's messed up.
---
Almost any lvl 19 blue BOE
---
Agreed. Also think of it on the other side of it. I could run the dungeon all day every day and unless im running with the same group, i may have different competition each time. Meaning i may see it drop 10 times but because I  had 10 different groups, I never won the roll. Its just better to reserve items / build the group to make it a non-issue.
---
&gt;to partake in the wave of Dire Maul groups.
---
isn t the argument the big majority isn t there yet ? then the big majority should be the wave :-) and not the tiny portion of no lifers rushing through content. i m a little confused here.
---
Well that's my point, turning off the exclusive racial abilities of a pet turns it into a generic pet with no specialization.  I could bring literally any pet at that point.  Their special unique abilities is one of the biggest reasons how I pick a species.  I just find it odd how I'm suddenly experiencing this problem when it never did this outside dungeons.  I've fought in close quarters before outside and it didn't have the wide radius as I'm experiencing.
---
If they were going to release anything early, I think it really should have been BGs. Less PvP-oriented players in the open world would have made it easier for slower levelers to catch up, especially on heavily imbalanced servers.
---
I‚Äôd roll a tank or a healer so the game doesn‚Äôt get stale. My main is a lock as well, leveling a druid bear just to be different.
---
Exactly.  
---
If you're talking about raiding, Frozen wrath is king in certain slots.
---
Disputing this is disputing well established theorycrafting from the past 15 years.  
---
But no, everybody is wrong but these guys, they've got the REAL information
---
This is wrong
---
There are a bunch of guides.  BoE blue/purple gear that is level 18/19 and 28/29 generally speaking.
---
I agree, simply because I never really got to experience wpvp in vanilla. That being said I think it'll be an absolute mess, I probably won't complain if they move it up similar to what they're doing with dm.
---
*smiles in ghost wolf*
---
Any chance blizzard releases pre nerf Cthun?
---
they could have also said "XXXX reserved" but then reddit would piss and shit themselves with someone reserving an item lol
---
I think magic dust will rise up in value massively when PvP is more of thing. My server is selling it for 50 silver, which isn't bad for a 5% drop of only like 5 mobs in the entire game
---
You can even make a dedicated channel just for that purpose lol
---
And tbh personally any guild that has such a hardon for themselves that they require you to fill out one of those cheesy ass forum threads like it's a job application. Yeah I'll skip.
---
I don‚Äôt even think you can transfer to any server unless it‚Äôs specifically from a high pop to a low pop. Other then that you are pretty stuck where you are.
---
There are about ten people in my guild who are 60 and geared. They posted that the first official raid is next week. I'm level 40. I consider that an accomplishment in itself considering my work and life schedule. I have a feeling many of those folks won't be on in late November.
---
(Draintanking is arguably not the best spec but is being worshipped on this sub)
---
This is just nonsensical logic tbh. 
---
If you see the rest of the group greed and then intentionally press need you ARE ninja looting. There is no two ways about it. You are making the statement that you are going to intentionally take that item without rolling with the rest of your group for it purely so you can profit. 
---
Loot rules don't matter. 
---
I don't understand why this sub is so adamant that it must defend such clearly asshole behaviour and say "they did nothing wrong". They did and you fucking know it.
---
I mean wasn‚Äôt one of the things that everyone praised classic for ‚Äúthat you don‚Äôt have to rush to end game, just enjoy the experience‚Äù
---
I literally have been unemployed and had the chance to play as much as I want of WoW. I‚Äôm still only level 48 with a solid 8-9 days played (slow I know - lots of afking and Warrior life)
---
So why rush the content releases along when the vast majority never even hit 60? I‚Äôll be honest I couldn‚Äôt give two fucks about the speedrunning people - they knew what they were doing, not much to complain about.
---
All of the whistleblowers*
---
Goldshire isn't a starting location.  That's Northshire Abbey.
---
Ah. So a nobody then. Gotcha.
---
‚ÄúBut how do they‚Äî?‚Äù
---
I agree that the heartseeling crossbow is good, but I‚Äôm not sure where you are getting that number of 10-15g from? On my server, I just bought one for 40g and that was by far the cheapest I could find.
---
big oof. we're both lvl 43 with mounts and farmed dragon pets
---
ran through uldaman with a bear tank, best tank i've had yet. i was able to multidot every single pull outdpsing the mage's blizzard and confuse the fuck out of our healer about why my hp wouldn't fall below 50% while tapping aggressively.  
---
bear tanks are amazing.
---
Didn‚Äôt age well
---
I'm not super mad but id prefer it would wait. I didnt get to play classic pre DM. It had been out along time when I hit 60 in vanilla. I'd love to see the nonDM meta for longer before DM comes out.
---
Whatever fills the entire chat window's length. :-)

Hey man, I'm not telling you how to play. I don't even know if I think the mount is worth it yet. But the last time I played a TBC private server, I couldn't deal with my mount being on the global when I was doing arena. Classic doesn't have anything THAT annoying to deal with, but we'll see.
---
You don't really need to cast spirit buff to whole party though.
---
Pick a different name commie
---
I log in an alt and hit them with a thought out smack down, and finish calling  them out for being a pussy and hitting ignore. Last laugh now, bitch.
---
This would cause short term issues but would level out eventually. The influx would "devalue" gold but then the inflation would level out to where 10g is the same as 20g. 
---
I could be wrong of course. This is just my experience from over a decade of Runescape/OSRS.
---
He said his WORK and SOCIAL life needed work, that sounds like a him problem addicted to a video game.

Video games are a real addiction and a lot of young adults can't control themselves.

---
Yeah, happens to me too. I exit the game thr right way yet it resets everytime
---
Maybe a little bit. #minimalchange
---
Bonuses:  You get used to ranged DPS role, your main is probably a Tailor so the alt gets all the benefits
---
Detractors:  Same type of class at a high level so could get boring,  same role so dungeons get repetitive
---
On Taiwanese WoW you can name your character Âè∞ÊπæÁúÅÊòØ‰∏≠ÂõΩ (Taiwan is part of China) but if you try to name your druid Á∂≠Â∞ºÁÜäÂíåË≤ì (Winnie the Pooh Bearcat) it gets blocked
---
As long as you are having fun, who cares?
---
He's not just not 60 he's level 32.  When census still worked weeks ago and I ran it nonstop the majority of players were above that.
---
There is nothing wrong with being behind, play how it is fun for you. There is no need to twist the truth to make yourself or others feel better.
---
Try the blue ones in winter spring bruh, one of those fucks see you and you‚Äôre insta dead
---
any way to fix this? -\_-
---
Why are you guys doing /roll in scarlet ? Chest?
---
Damn that's so soon!! Vast majority of players aren't even level 60 yet.
---
Its super fast, high dps, almost no downtime, and does well in dungeons. Its a very good leveling spec.
---
Did you have any good ways to check if you were on the same layer as the one you killed him over a day prior?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not a guild of folks with spouses, kids and/or a career...
---
&gt; not enough time for casuals to play at 60 without all the game changing items in Dire Maul.
---
So, completely blizzlike?
---
 I can understand that but this was never an issue in vanilla, retail years later made this an issue. They‚Äôre imposing standards that were never there in the first place and as WoW aged people came in and left. Theres people who originally played WoW and quit who don‚Äôt know the VC acronym and people who didn‚Äôt play vanilla but came later don‚Äôt know the DM acronym so there‚Äôs a disconnect. Best to just use the default that was there originally and adapt to that. 
---
But I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as chaos, just stubbornness on both sides. But honestly people need to use common sense because it‚Äôs not gonna change
---
Far from 1% there is a ton of people that are already level 60 who are done with dungeons except for maybe 1-2 pieces. Sure there‚Äôs also tons of people who just got the mount but if your goal is to take it slow you can do that with DM out as well
---
DM trinkets are pretty much even with briarwood and drakkisath trinkets except for I think two classes (Hunter and Priest). Could be wrong. I'll admit that Quel'serrar is a big deal.
---
Upvote for Pride of Baghdad.
---
Is this a relaunch with them unchained from their Korean overlords who money whored and ruined the original Archeage?
---
By below 60, you mean between 50 and 60 at this point. It's getting hard to get groups in the 30s and my server is full pop peak hours.
---
Rogues are fun to level if you like sneaking and Ambushing people from behind. They can also be very rich of you set a macro to pickpocket before your first attack.
---
Fremdscham
---
This has nothing to do with being a MacBook Pro, you can run this game on nothing tbh. Sounds like your battery is in trouble.
---
Quite literally just got the 900g I needed for my epic this morning and as I was heading over to buy it I saw the DM release news. Stopped and instead I bought the mats for my charger lol couldn‚Äôt have timed it any better
---
WTF why are they rushing it?  Fucking stupid.  This is way too soon, no reason to tailor the game to the top 5% of levelers... ugh I wanted Classic to last.  So now I guess by the time I'm 60 no reason to be able to do Molten Core?  Now the economy is going to be all fucked up too before it's even stabilized?  This sets a very bad precedent for Classic IMO.
---
There is no way to see the current lowest price of an Item without addons.
---
Because it's now known it is coming soon rather than being months and months away.  They are used in mount quests and other things that come with DM.
---
They won't be enabling PvE to PvP likely ever. Otherwise folks would level on PvE to avoid getting ganked then transfer over once 60 and geared. Reroll.
---
Paladin players, what makes you enjoy the class? What do you find fun about it?
---
I never tried to answer the question lol? I was just saying it‚Äôs the same odds as rolling any other 5 digit combo which is true
---
Correct me if I am wrong but the Lock mount is not free, you will still spend iirc an estimated 600-700g on all the required parts of the quest chain. Plus you will need to do the long quest chain and find people for it (should be easy doing it when DM launches though with everyone needing it). I've also seen people arguing the regular mounts are better for PVP too because they are not spells.
---
I still think most people could have waited, but it's not as big of a deal as you are making out imo.
---
The other side is not many people give a fuck, we have learnt so much about the game and R14 was mostly about time investment and less skill.
---
R14 players back then were good but the best PvPers this time around will be scary good.
---
Thats when you change it to Handjabs anyways and let the GM fuck off until they force the name change upon you.
---
Taken on a phone from 2004 I see
---
ENHancement!
---
Honestly for most part didn't join any groups but if you do join a group kill a mob first and when you join it'll respawn or be in a different position if it is you are on the other layer. Then when you leave group try doing same thing to get back to right layer
---
Do you like what oldschool runescape is doing with polling every potential change with the players?
---
I know and I used to be one of those try hards. I just don't agree with this logic. I'm not speaking for everyone but I at least feel like a lot of us wanted to re live classic to have an MMO that took time and dedication, not something that just threw content at you. I've played plenty of "content" heavy MMO's since vanilla and they all just kinda sucked. I agree with you, I think we're going to be at phase 4 by march which means that over half the "lifespan" of classic will be done in less than a year. I don't understand blizz's logic here. Do they think we will all magically sub to retail when classic is done? I sure as hell won't be
---
{Nipple}
---
pretty sure there's a talent or ability that boosts the affect but elliminates the 1 hp block
---
Had some rogue 9 lvls lower challenge me to a dual in Darkshire, while I was playing remotely from my phone. I didn't buff or anything. He wrecked me. He /yelled and mocked me and PMd be harrassment, so I publicly challenged him to a rematch and used my PC. Humiliated him by letting him fully heal twice. I just copy pasted all his harrasment into public chat, and he ignored my whispers. He then got his guild to PM me for hours. Dude was for sure Horde playing Alliance.
---
Here is what you do. Go tank (it‚Äôs obviously where your heart is) and tank dungeons getting all of your pre raid BIS tank gear. Along the way you also roll on all the resto/oomkin gear  (if you clear it with the group before hand literally nobody cares) you see along the way, chances are it‚Äôs getting sharded anyways.
---
Now that you have BIS gear for all available specs you can lick your finger and put it to the wind. If you find a solid raid group willing to take you as a MT/OT, great. If not, your healing gear is ready to go and you get the spot anyway. It‚Äôs only a matter of time until your group needs a tank and you have feral  gear ready to go.
---
Engineering.
---
Toss some dynamite at them and LOS.
---
Anyone who says there is little content in phase 1 just doesn't understand how much prep one needs to do for the rest of classic.  Farming rep,  consumes, gold, all the mats you need for later, etc. Its endless.
---
My recommending him Kargoz's video was answering his question. Draintanking and more is covered in it.   
---
Just sayin. I ain't into spoonfeeding people builds because they wind up only understanding certain mechanics. It's best to research multiple builds and THEN choose a path.
---
bet you dont feel so smart now
---
&gt;Stun resist makes orc arguably the best Horde choice 
---
Could have stopped there.
---
I'm 53... where is this hit gear you speak of? Only thing I know of is the ring from maraudon.
---
There is not a single item for mages in dire maul that replaces any gear from other dungeons.
---
The future's not ours to see...
---
It definitely is. They funded my epic mount. Very easy as an ele shaman and all the mage bullying I got to do made it fun.
---
Not to mention that all needing on BoEs is going completely against the purpose of the system. Need = I want to use it. Greed = I want to profit from it. That's why it's caller "greed", because it means "I want more money".
---
Its really disappointing to see this sub defending this shit. The only reason why "All need on BoEs" has become the norm is because of asshole ninja looters and now clowns on here are actually defending this behaviour as "they did nothing wrong".
---
I‚Äôve had two friends look at the Badlands, trying to run from odd spots. One got stuck in the Blasted Lands, the other ended up in EPL.
---
Help your local lowbie out, and if you see a low-lvl at Thorium Point they took a wrong turn.
---
You‚Äôre full of shit
---
At least currently blue shards aren't worth shit tho.

Last night I was doing ‚ÄòCounterattack‚Äô in the barrens. A bunch of centaurs spawn and you have a big battle until an elite comes out. Couldn‚Äôt solo it as a warrior so I said LFM in chat and got some Hunter to join. He was on the complete opposite side of the map so I‚Äôm chillin for like 10 minutes, he‚Äôs not even headed my way, and see 2 ppl show up to kill the elite. I drop group and ask for an invite. A few minutes later I get a pm from the hunter ‚ÄúWOW THANKS FOR WASTING MY
---
TIME YOU PIECE OF SHIT. DROPS GROUP AND DOESNT EVEN SAY ANYTHING‚Äù and immediately put me on ignore. People are fucking insane sometimes lol.
---
Female orcs don't look too stupid in leveling robes. All lock sets looks dope at 60, so doesn't matter after a while.
---
DW fury has a pretty large dps lead over 2h fury, right? Horde side?
---
Why didn't you tell him about exorcism? 
---
I mean a paladin that usually cannot range pull (unless using the Linken's trinket) told you that he cannot pull. 
---
Instead of telling him "This is an UD instance, you can use exorcism since the enemies are UD" you preferred to pull everything for him and wipe? 
---
Are you "mythic palace" (whatever that is? retail?) guys that socially inept to not tell a person how to play properly when the person is basically asking for help?
---
I'm honestly amazed how basic human interaction seems to be "rocket science" for "mythic palace" people.
---
Dope! Thanks for the advice
---
Edit: Never mind, reading your post history I‚Äôd like to re-direct you towards r/niceguys
---
How I imagine that conversation went between posts:
---
OP: *Ah, now I can finally get my life back together*
---
OP To GF: I just quit the game that‚Äôs been taking up all my free time! Now I‚Äôll be able to-
---
GF: You what? You were playing a fucking game this whole time you were blowing me off?!?
---
OP: Y-yes but... I‚Äôve stopped now! And I can-
---
GF: I can't believe this! What bullshit! I‚Äôm breaking up with you!
---
DM took over 4 months to be released originally.
---
Take note ladies and gentlemen, the man has status, success, wealth, and class, yet he still bears his curse of a name. I don‚Äôt particularly think ‚ÄúGaylord‚Äù is a bad name. Just old school. He might have been named after his grandfather or something. Name your children thoughtfully. Don‚Äôt name them Tyrion Daenerys because those are your two favorite characters in the TV show (not even the fucking book) you were watching while you were pregnant.
---
Jealousy
---
&gt;I never tried to answer the question lol?
---
Thanks for pissing on my shoes and telling me it's raining.
---
&gt;I was just saying it‚Äôs the same odds as rolling any other 5 digit combo which is true
---
Which it isn't. 
---
Besides...if it was, what's the answer? 
---
Or are we going to keep hiding behind someone else's college paper as we get posted on r/iamverysmart?
---
Did the same last night. I walked away mid-fight to get my food without even thinking twice about it. Came back and I was practically dead.
---
Yup, just hit 52 here.
---
Best to just say DM for deadmines or I hate you 
---
/ignore
---
Yeah man...I'm really disappointed in this decision.
---
The loudest players are usually the minority.
---
So you joined the ass holes in a need roll? Rolling greed would enforce your argument tbh so your argument is invalid as you joined in regardless of them rolling need or not.
---
Just did, feigned and auto shot and its not shooting for atleast 2 globals. (full red bar on weapon swing timer)
---
Feigned and auto shot with any instant, auto still doesn't go off for like 3-4 seconds.
---
But if you feign and aimed shot it CASTS normally and goes off as it should and you get a big dps increase from not sitting around looking at your ranged wep cocked for 3 seconds because you feigned.
---
His response at least got a nose snort. Yours are just pathetic.
---
How much fire res do you have just from gear? whats your defense rating?
---
Do you think that person is the only one who isn‚Äôt 60?
---
You thought that PVP was gonna be a slaughter before, wait until the gap between the average player and the no-lifers gets even bigger with DM pre-BIS.
---
Because the vast majority of 3D games are based on a relatively small number of common engines / platforms.
---
WoW is unusual by having what is to my knowledge a completely custom game engine (and again that goes double for the classic client)
---
Stay in the forest killing boars.
---
Zerker rage doesn‚Äôt give rage without fury talent. It only increases rage given from dmg taken, and if the mobs are running lvl over, it‚Äôs useless.
---
You are really exaggerating the amount of players that has "exploited" to 60, this was fixed very early on. Almost every group that is doing aoe farming in dungeon are not coordinated enough to get a good xp/hr that bets out effective questing.
---
I always yell things when running at thst boat. "WAIT FOR ME!" *boat starts leaving without me* "NOOOOOO COME BACK!"
---
I died one day when someone yelled back 'bye"
---
EDIT: They finally resolved it and sent him a pair of unbound gloves. The initial response is still hilarious.
---
As an orc warrior planning to raid with 2h because the weapon choices are just more economically viable + windfury, why is 2h fury the build to go for and not 2h arms?
---
You mean just like in Vanilla when Rag hadn‚Äôt even been killed yet when this dungeon was released?
---
Might be harder than some classes, but if you want to raid you will be able to raid. Play what you enjoy, and make connections on your way up.
---
Ok let‚Äôs look at the buyers.  How many people  percent wise do you think look at a one copper difference and buy the more expensive one rather an undercut? Even 10%?  I doubt it.  Do you seriously list auctions at the exact price as others when you know people will sort by cheapest?
---
Sure.
---
This is such self serving mentality. 
---
Can I take it further and say "hmm, well vendoring this drop is a percentage of my Lionheart helm cost so I'm entitled to need it"?
---
Are we going to assign some arbitrary value where the drop must be a certain percentage of something you want to buy before people are entitled to need it? 
---
No. Need should mean "I'm going to click this and use it", not "I can make some gold from this".
---
Needing shit to sell it is such utterly trash mentality.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt have to? It‚Äôs literally proven and common sense 
---
You won't, because you can't, because you're wrong.
---
&gt;Apparently being ignorant really makes you mad lul
---
That's correct. As someone who did well in math in school and was a professional poker player for several years, seeing someone this stupid be so sure of himself while being so wrong makes me mad.
---
And the paper...like, wtf? Is it YOUR paper?
---
I think it's pretty important to have an axe. The crit with axes synergizes with other talents (cruelty, imp overpower, impale, deep wounds), you get more rage when you crit, you need the burst in PVP. Crit is everything
---
Way too early Blizzard! Holy smokes! I thought I was progressing fairly fast, but I'm not even 50 and I'll have a much harder time finding people to do current level 60 dungeons with this out.
---
not really, jokes aside, we dont really know what we want. see flying mounts.
---
"nose snort"
---
Lmfao.....
---
Now that's pathetic. Holy nerd shit jesus lmfao you kids really need to get outside.
---
"A simply misclick" actually.
---
I'm not 100% sure this response is legit. These types of responses are usually pre generated and dont have..5+ significant grammar issues.
---
Pretty cool!  How much did that server hardware cost you?
---
Its because they aren't 60 and know that the more harder content comes out then those other people wont be there to carry them to free gear.
---
I had a nice five misses in a row the other day and died to a mob. 
---
That‚Äôs why I say ‚ÄúFuck soloing‚Äù and always run around town looking for people to group with before heading out.
---
The priest gear is pretty sick, maybe around 7 or 8 upgrades over other dungeon loot. Basically nothing but a bow that has the same stats as the one in LBRS for my fury warrior though.
---
Yeah. But if your goal is to experience the classic feel and progression, this kinda forces you to play very intensely to keep pace with releases. If you aren‚Äôt at the front of the pack, you won‚Äôt get the feel of the phase system. I think that‚Äôs where people are a bit let down.
---
For instance, I won‚Äôt get to experience the game without dire maul, even though I‚Äôm an active player. This is why I feel it is rushed.
---
It is still pretty expensive for the mats is it not?
---
Not sure what everyone's problem is on this sub. Raiding in classic *is* easy and compared to retail even more so. Doesn't mean I like retail, but still.
---
Releasing a bg with phase 2 makes 0 sense. That is thr world pvp phase. If they release wsg with it, might as well throw in AV, because the fun of an honor system where you have to go out in the world to rank is now gone.
---
I keep seeing post to level to 42 and you'll make a good chunk of money now. I could be wrong it's just what I've seen
---
Well DM is going to make places like UBRS mostly redundant.
---
The only difference for warriors is a cloak and bracers for tanking. For dps the bis is the same.
---
Looks like yall need to learn the power of the triangle
---
***''Bring your friends to Azeroth, but don't forget to go outside Azeroth with them as well!''***

he google translated the shit outta u
---
Last weekend I bought like 300 runecloth for literally under the vendor price when converted to bandages.
---
Speed leveling in retail? Isn‚Äôt leveling in retail fast as fuck anyways? I feel like adding speed into that sentence is just unnecessary. I mean when BfA dropped I was max level in a few days of casual play.
---
Theres a couple good raw gold farms where you gather up expensive vendor trash from mobs for 10-20g/hr depending on density. Look up Studen Albatroz on youtube he makes gold guides that are usually pretty solid. Has a few of the raw gold farms.
---
Grind while collecting herbs and sell it all on ah. Certain low level potions are profitable but most aren't.
---
IMO, timing really doesn't matter... all current content is faceroll anyway.

I've had so many players buff me as I go about my travels, it doesn't go unnoticed, so thank you!

Locks are lucky to get a rejuv out of me

TASTE THE FLAVORS OF SULFURON!
---
Should have crafted that dank deepdive helmet
---
Is the classic community really picky when it comes to raiding?
---
I still think Daoc had the best pvp of any mmo. It was also bolstered by having 3 factions tho, so no one side could ever grow too dominate
---
Onyxia isn't really a raid it's a 3minute fight and takes longer to travel there
---
Needed helm of fire for instant 40 yard tag
---
Why are they not sticking to the original planned schedule .... this is barely a month and a half in and already releasing economy &amp; gear disturbing content.... Why not stick to the phase calendar which the large majority has adopted as a great comprise..

Goddamnit i just bought an epic mount today because I thought it was far off.
---
Seriously the guy is a complete anti-thesis to the whole Asmon bullshit. I cannot recommend Madseason enough.
---
Oh I'll have one at some point down the road.
---
I feel like this makes me feel "forced to play more" or else i will fall behind by miles. I hate this forced to play feeling (have to do dailies etc) and its the reason i quit wow originally. But way to cater to the streamers...
---
Fair points, let me just mention just a few things that resonated with me:
---
The skill disparity and sheer knowledge today vs 15 years ago, that's all legit and I agree. Let me also say that the people who actually understand the difference between what gear is optimal vs flailing 15 years ago - some here will say, oh that's just a Google search away, but that also glosses over a very important point.
---
And that is - the people who actually *care* to look these things up, to go anywhere near the start of the min/maxing mindset...this is the very moment that the level of investment from the player changes, from that of a casual/semi-casual(Thank you for the terminology) changes to that of someone who's quite a bit more serious.
---
I even daresay, that the type of people who are even here at all...a Classic WoW subreddit that explores and has all the resources available to optimize gear, which places to get what, so on and so forth...aren't super casual/casual.
---
I understand the "average Joe/Jane" that I perceive as such, isn't so to the people here. No, they consider themselves as the "average". If they've been clearing MC for the last 2 weeks, well that's the average. And they expect that oh come on I've been doing it forever, and you just started...gosh you're late to the game. And they hand-wave off anyone who isn't 60, as just nobodies unworthy of consideration and these people "don't count".
---
But I think they do count. I also think how remarkable it is, that the attitudes only a month ago were all about "take your time, don't rush, it's about the journey, not the destination" to suddenly we're hearing people go, MC's old news, let's hurry and get more content already.
---
And the game hasn't even been out 3 months. I remember the first time I hit 60, and I took darned long time to get there, 15 years ago. Now it just all feels different, people are go go go despite them in the same breath going, no no don't rush, take your time. I see a lot of people being disengeuous about truly, how much time they're really spending on the game and trying to imply oh no no it's total casual play and they got 60 without even trying.
---
How does layering lead to a surplus of supply? You still have exactly the same number of buyers and sellers...
---
Alright thanks! Back to the grind it is.
---
&gt; I want to
---
Do it!
---
No, it's not going to be useful for *very* long, but if you want to do it and you don't mind running deadmines, why not? It's a fun goal!
---
Honestly if you can talk them into letting you roll on DPS gear as compensation for doing something you didn't necessarily sign up for...fucking win, right?
---
Me, see a bunch of you clowns running around though.

I love it too. Imagine if they catered to people who thought Dire Maul made MC useless!
---
Gawd i love the backhanded spin that undead / human warriors do
---
Desire for more content.... plz no. It's hardly been out a month. This about the time mauradon was released. So many dungeons just not gonna get run when DM has suck better gear.
---
Because I'll buy the cheapest one, even if it's by 1 copper. No, **especially** if it's by that amount, since I know the seller's not an idiot
---
Offended Boomer spotted
---
The only way they continue this cash cow is that they add new content.  I don‚Äôt mean adding the rest of vanilla either.  They need to add whatever canceled content they had before TBC took over development resources.
---
Lol if you‚Äôll be behind and you‚Äôve BEEN 60, wth am I doing trying to get to 60?
---
I‚Äôm lvl 48, prob 49 tomorrow or the next day, and I play basically everyday but if people are going to be locked out of endgame content because they got to the party late, I don‚Äôt see the point and should unsub from this game. 
---
Granted I‚Äôm a Druid that plans to respec at 60 to resto but I‚Äôd rather not waste my time if by the time I get there within the next month I‚Äôm just standing around (I heard most guilds only take 1-2 druids).
---
Honestly I am getting a little worried I‚Äôll have wasted my time to get to end game because I‚Äôm behind all of the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù players and won‚Äôt be able to enjoy raid content and gear. 
---
Hope I‚Äôm wrong, but seeing all the end game stuff here and now blizzard releasing DM because the current raids are already complete makes me feel like I‚Äôm falling behind and becoming disconnected from the main base of players, which is exactly why I unsubbed during WOTLK. Just fell behind and didn‚Äôt want to grind just to get back to the starting point only to have to grind to not fall behind..
---
Meh. This comment is all jumbled but I‚Äôm starting to see why I quit WoW in the first place.
---
Camping a flight path with a raid isnt going to give you shit for honor. Better to go attack the boats, ss vs tm, or go to brm if you have that many people
---
Its a BoE. You could always tell the people who clicked greed to roll too. 
---
You won't though. Because your "default rules" are set up in your head so you can screw your group out of a fair chance on a technicality.
---
I‚Äôm debating between shadow priest and warlock for pvp. I love world pvp and 1v1s. I like the idea of dots and maybe the occasional big hit. Unkillable attrition style playing.
---
Stuff like the mysterious shard from Wc. My friend who was with me said he looted the boss but didn‚Äôt see the item.
---
DM was current content for MC during vanilla as well. It may have been released 4 months after the game was released, but the world MC clear still didn't happen for another month. DM during MC *was* the full experience for everyone who played the game.
---
On the *extremely* small chance that you were in Method or one of the other guilds going for world first you may have had some of the MC bosses killed prior to getting access to DM gear, but literally everyone had access to DM gear before Ragnaros died the first time.
---
Gear and difficulty issues aren't because of dire maul. They're because numerous improvements were made between patch 1.1 and 1.12 that weren't content related. Numerous class talent tree revamps, bug fixes and gear revamps, not to mention the sheer amount of information  and addons available now. For example at release there was basically no gear with spell damage on it.
---
Activision Blizzard sucks.
---
Its faster to cleave actually you retail boomers are so slow its unbelievable
---
The difficulty increase with bwl and then aq40 should restore some challenge for the groups pushing content.
---
It's a meme people don't genuinely think that

Dire maul, while ran by 60s for FR gear, it‚Äôs not a level 60 dungeon.
---
If they don't have time to get to 60 then they won't have time to raid MC period. Unless they all think they can find guilds to carry them in their 45 minutes of game time a night
---
I honestly don‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt use /ignore once during vanilla days. I just never forgot the names of the assholes. My own personal blacklist in my head. Reputation is probably one of the coolest yet most basic social aspect of WoW in general. I still remember the name of the God tier priest player on Oceanic: ‚ÄúResq‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember his gear, I just remember he was a solid player with a sick name. Told him once ‚ÄúBro, so sick. Your name is pronounce as ‚Äòrescue‚Äô and you‚Äôre a bomb ass healer.‚Äù He just told me it stood for ‚ÄúRefridgeration and Electrical Services, Queensland.‚Äù Fuckin bastard took all the cool out of his own sails.
---
3 frost mages, lock, priest. Lock used VW to sacrifice bubble as well as his eye to pull. Priest bubbles eye and mages swap their cool downs while kiting. Lock can either rain of fire or sacrifice bubble and hellfire while the mobs are frozen in place.
---
Lol, I do exactly the opposite. 
---
spend my early 20s in ashenvale and then do redridge elite qs+blackrock orcs and escort+shadowhide pendants.
---
You.... don‚Äôt have to join the group.... lol.
---
It‚Äôs only ethical
---
So if you play on a pvp server you must kill every single person for no reason simply because its a pvp server? I mostly pvp if someone wants to pvp its just lame to gank up on some lowbie that hasn't done anything to me. But I would gladly sit on your corpse for an hour or two.
---
Yes and going from 160% to 200% is 25% more.
---
For priests, make sure to do the quest Blackfathom Villainy ([A](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1200/blackfathom-villainy)|[H](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6561/blackfathom-villainy)) in BFD. It will reward you with a wand that does amazing damage till about level 35 or so. Maybe even longer. You can do the quest at 18, but 23-25 would be a better level to PUG it. 
---
Spirit Tap 5/5 and Wand Specialization 5/5 will let you go on forever with that wand. PW:S, Mind Blast, SW:P, and then wand until dead. I don't think my priest even has water in their bags because I never have to use it while leveling.
---
I also have one of these and It‚Äôs just sitting in my bank. I read somewhere that someone did 1500 runs of Uldaman and the bow dropped 10 times.
---
As long as a persons financial, health, and relationship requirements are fulfilled they shouldn't feel bad about their hobbies based on how much time other people think is OK.
---
Unfortunately, most people who have a problem insist that they're meeting the criteria for those things when actually aren't which puts a lot of skepticism on the people who are actually walking that line.
---
R.I.P. King Terenas Menethil II, the last true king of Lordereon.
---
That's a straight up lie just fyi.
---
DM was released 1 month before MC was full cleared for the first time. DM was released in March and MC wasn't cleared for the first time until April. Even world first guilds had access to DM gear when killing ragnaros.
---
&gt;You're not going to experience MC and Ony as the original game due to being farm more overgeared than expected.
---
No you're not going to experience MC and Ony because of a huge amount of changes present in 1.12 that are unrelated to new content.
---
* We have new talent trees for most classes that are much more functional introduced across numerous patches spanning from 1.7 to 1.11.
---
* We have gear itemization that wasn't present in 1.1. For example, At release practically no gear had spell power at all.
---
* We have bug fixes so that the content performs without wigging out and your spells work properly
---
* We have new servers and computers that don't lag so that you don't have to chain cast using /stopcasting macros.
---
* We have a plethora of very detailed addons that provide all kinds of handy information that weren't present at release. Not just DBM functionality but functionality taken for granted like Target of Target and Enemy Cast Bars.
---
* We have computers that can get high FPS in raids
---
* We have detailed write ups and boss videos in easily accessible locations not to mention plenty of BIS lists.
---
* We have a 16 debuff limit instead of the 8 debuff limit present at release
---
There are numerous reasons why you won't be able to experience MC like it was in vanilla, but unless you were part of the world first team, dire maul was not one of the reasons (and even then DM makes a minimal difference since they had access to DM gear for their first Rags kill)
---
This is an interesting discussion because we are basically arguing what is the definition of hardcore and I think it changes based on perspective.
---
My opinion of hardcore is that if you spend all or most of your free time on one thing or hobby that makes you hardcore whether  that is 2 or 8 hours a day.
---
I think you can be a hardcore gamer without it effecting your personal life.
---
Take the perspective that hardcore tv watching has become a normal thing for society. Think back to when TV first came out you weren't exactly thought of as a great member of society if you sat in front of the tv all day. Hell, when I was a kid I remember grandma making comments about me watching cartoons all Saturday morning.
---
Now as gaming has become more popular and a cultural norm spending hours in front of a computer isnt seen as this horrible thing, so the definition of being hardcore has kinda shifted to this perception of what you described as letting your life deteriorate instead of just spending most of your free time on one hobby.
---
I will add that I think hardcore still holds this stigma of what you said of it letting it affect your personal life, so people dont like being called that and I apologize if I have offended you it was not my intention.
---
Delightfully entertainung
---
I don't think they're doing that because some of the gear it rewards is as powerful as the phase 5 catch up gear
---
To be honest he was a good sport about the run and did not overuse AOE. :)
---
Its two screenshots of chat stacked on top
---
I don't believe that for one iota. Half the servers are completely full at primetime. There's no queues anymore because they got rid of that entirely, not because there's not a ton of people playing. There's just no questing in high population, contested zones during primetime.
---
And they said MEDIUM population was the same as HIGH population in Vanilla. And my server is MEDIUM in the off-hours at like 5am. That's the lowest it ever gets.
---
some bullshit
---
Yep, more agi from the 2h than two 1h axes.
---
Yup, and that's a big reason why wow is addicting and some people will literally neglect their children for it.
---
Nope. That's not the case. They'll progress the game however fast they want to. That's what "oh well" is about. I don't think it should be accelerated but I'll have fun either way.
---
gg blizz reeeeee
---
Who was a Lordereon noble... and as the goober above you made so abundantly clear the forsaken are the people of Lorderon. Ironically the blood elves by joining the horde re-allied themselves with the people who persecuted them lmao. But I'm sure that's the modern Alliance's fault somehow too.
---
have the same problem...running a repair now
---
I really wish I had just done skinning and held off on enchanting. So many skinnable beasts everywhere I went but very little value generated from enchanting because gear is replaced so quickly.
---
Everyone's cool with anyone winning a roll till someone wins the roll. "Need if you need it" is the motto. Less of course it's some expensive BoE like a really good blue or even a purple. Then it's everyone need to make sure no one gets scammed.
---
Oh that explains all the fiery weapon skinning knives. Though I think they were being sold for less than the recipe cost.
---
I disagree! Retail is the exact opposite, where every little thing is time-gated to make sure casuals don‚Äòt ever fall behind players who invest more time. 
---
Whenever I play Retail, I find myself having nothing to do all day after doing my time-gated ‚Äûchores‚Äú. 
---
In Classic, I can decide I want to farm a faction to exalted and just do it. If I want to farm my pre-bis items, I just farm the dungeon over and over. In Retail, getting to exalted with a faction caps me out at x reputation per day with daily quests and that‚Äòs all I can do there. It sucks!
---
Usually, in Retail when a new patch or expansion is released, I can play a lot for 1 or 2 days and then I only login for 2 hours a day, do my chores, and I‚Äòm done for the day. Mythic+ is the only happy exception. With Classic, I‚Äòm playing a shit ton since release (around 23-24 days /played now) and there‚Äòs still some stuff (even though not a lot) to do on my Main. Luckily my alt is 60 now and the pre-bis farm for that one starts.
---
&gt; 0/30/21
---
I haven't looked at guides or played druid, but...I'm assuming Nature's Swiftness is the reason you don't take Leader of the Pack.  Is it *that* clutch?
---
And the DM vs. VC acronym debate will finally be over!
---
An optimist might think that brain uploading technology will let you live in Classic WoW *forever*.
---
ive still got my war named lickmypvpness
---
Lvl 53 horde, going to finish up in Un'Goro and ding 54. Where to then? Got two quests asking me to go to Winterspring, one to Western Plaguelands, two to Azshara, and one to Burning Steppes
---
Also great for bankers for that long run from auctioneer to mailbox.
---
this happened to me on my warrior last night, its bittersweet
---
&gt;	I want a whole heck of a lot of changes to classic, including extra content patches and faster cycles. But I'm not surprised I'm not getting it.
---
Hey, neither am I. See my original comment. I stated blizzard can‚Äôt win. 
---
I think people wanting a slower content release cycle are right to ask for it as well. 
---
&gt;	Funny how you accuse me of strawmanning your argument while doing exactly that. nice.
---
Confused what I used as a strawman. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to respond. Or do it via PM. I think we agree, in the end.
---
Fair I guess, though the reverse is EASILY possible. Run the dungeon and lose the promised gold upon the reins drop. You only have their word (it's not like they need a SECOND reins) and it's not likely they'd pay you ahead of time just for a high chance of a "normal" run.
---
Same here, tried repairing the game files but that didn't fix it.
---
Always good when ninjas swear in whispers, at least I can report for language.

---
people referring to this as a "catch-up" mechanic are the ones without a vanilla mindset, I just see this as more content for my group of friends to clear through, whenever we do it :)
---
It's only been 30 seconds and I'm already feeling withdrawal symptoms.
---
Still though didn't dire maul release 3 1/2 months after launch
---
Bleh, same here
---
Jed runs are super easy and its a 33% drop from him. Why wouldnt you want to do that?
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
~~Same- repair utility didn't fix the issue. Going to try a restart as well.~~
---
Edit: Restart didn't work, but I stepped away from my computer for a bit while on the server screen and they changed from incompatible back to normal. I'm now in the game.
---
Yes they all there. Hinterlands quests too
---
Huh...I've seen that but I didn't recall that from it.
---
&lt;3 Molly C Quinn though.
---
I've bought runecloth from 6k honored up to 18k revered with Darn so I could use a tiger (I refuse to use the human mount after being forced alliance to play with friends), figured Warlock mount was coming out in late nov/dec so I'd get some use out of the tiger.
---
1 week warning out of nowhere REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Guess I haven't actually \*bought\* the tiger but I've put in 400g of runecloth investment so far
---
From a min-maxing standpoint, a person should be playing the game as much as they can humanly possible, to extract the absolute maximum possible value out of that monthly subscription.
---
Really that goes for any subscription-based service, be it gaming or music. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if some people have Spotify playing 24/7/365 at all times, over multiple devices concurrently to make the absolute most out of it.
---
But there are those who just don't do it that way.
---
Feck, RIP to all of us slowly levelling.
---
Im going to kill people everywhere. The good part of the honor system is no matter what im doing i can take time out to fight the enemy faction and get rewarded for it.
---
those are definitely words
---
Didnt work for me :(
---
Dude what you talking about?  It's all about that sweet, sweet boss-skipping end chest!
---
damn, i work 9-6 so I've only hit lvl 45
---
But like I said I know my audio is quiet, but if you see nodes, but not data in Routes. You might not have edited the 2nd file properly. 
---
Post a Screenshot your Autoshow.lua code?
---
Sad.  Anyone who is already out of content 6 weeks in only has themselves to blame.  Now we know they will be catering classic to the sweaty tryhards.  Bad omen for things to come. :/
---
I'm getting the same issue on EU.
---
Same on EU, Im so mad right now.
---
Can you link some pieces that are better than mc gear?
---
Layer hopping was proven to be the way most people got to 60 in the first week. Even the first ever 60. Don't think I am exaggerating the majority of first week 60's
---
So happy it is coming early! Wish battle grounds werent so far away. We prob wont see them till like feb or mar
---
I think you‚Äôre all in the wrong here except the rogue lol.
---
The priest could have initiated the trade.
---
The mage could have initiated the trade.
---
The person who‚Äôs pulling mobs without making sure the priest is squared away with water.  
---
The only logical person was the rogue lol.
---
Same here.
---
Like the poet William Smith said: Don't start nothin, won't be nothin.
---
Same issue here
---
No one of the questions was about pugs, I didn't answer that one
---
Apart from the server issues that have since been resolved it's fine?
---
Classic PTS had far more bugs and release turned out mostly okay
---
Vendor spec mage
---
[Ooo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLdqcEwmKQM)
---
yes to that !! the game is what you want. want that set ? go for it and enjoy the travel !!
---
yeah fuck that guy for making a reasonable inference about the release schedule and daring to show his face online where the reddit hyenas lurk.
---
Hey I'm only lol 29 and decided I really don't like mages and remembered I was always a warrior main and just restarted and am now 22.
---
I got ages to go, but hey, the main thing is classic is still to lvl 60. Whatever phase you hit 60 on, you'll still be able to say you hit max lvl on classic, the hardest version of Wow to level on.
---
IIRC no phase of classic is going to make levelling much easier at all. The achievement will still be prestigious and impressive in itself. Who cares if other people beat you to it - this is your adventure and not theirs.
---
Shhh, don't try to argue with these guys. Class mounts bad. Make the game unplayable. Costs 1% of your mana pool to use. Invisible mages will be standing by waiting for the opportunity to spell lock your mount cast, because that's totally a thing that's known to happen.
---
I think they rolled out tomorrow's patch tonight... Oops!
---
Same issue here &gt;\_\_\_\_&gt;
---
The 'druids are worse' thing is purely from being unable to reach uncritable, which really doesn't matter outside of progression raiding.  Heck, even then there are a few fights where bigger health pool &gt; uncritable (hello Patchwerk)
---
Less than an epic mount normally, and can be shared with others.
---
I'll see you in Hell, boy.
---
Phase 1 end game is a big boring with only 3 dungeons so a new one is welcome. Most of the people who aren't 60 by now probably aren't ever going to do much end game content so if doesn't really affect them.
---
Same issue here. was working an hour ago
---
Lol. I can't wait. It's going to be a blast
---
did the repair.... still not fixed here
---
me tooooooo
---
Small Indie company
---
Probably longer, people will be unlucky with their loot so those who were will help out
---
Not really, don‚Äôt stress. I‚Äôve started vanilla with AQ release and caught up pretty quickly. Plus your gaming commitment obviously changed, so look for a guild that‚Äôs on your level.
---
Because we wanted Classic, mechanics and all, and we got it. Be careful what you wish for?
---
I got kicked and it auto installed, immediately got this too
---
There‚Äôs already a few people with winterspring mount on my server - 6 weeks after release! Lol, I thought grindig this out would take like half a year!
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
In that circumstance to check their feelings what I do is get away. I'm a druid so it's easy. Then I'll lick them and pop out of stealth from farther away and wave.
---
If they /sorry or wave then we good. If they attack a 2nd time? Oh baby world pvp is back!!! Enjoy the corpse runs :D
---
/lick
---
15 year old game - check
---
same content - check
---
same bullshit issues from blizzard - check
---
The Leather Fairy.
---
female orcs do this as well
---
Remember when Anduin set up a meetup for living Lorderon refugees to meet their loved ones and Sylvanas murdered them all?
---
as good of an idea that is, mob rule created retail
---
Serious delete the wtf folder. Log in set your settings log out. When you log back in everything should be good. I've had this issue in retail as well many times
---
i have this too
---
Paladin... is probably easiest to do that with, yes. And a no-stance-dance-warrior.
---
My Rogue main is definitely not optimal one-handed. üòã
---
I for one am happy they are catering the pace of the phase releases to the hardcore crowd. It's how it should be. Filthy casuals can QQ moar.
---
Yep same here
---
back up for me
---
nm doesn't show as incompatible but wont log in
---
try again now. They just pushed an update and the servers themselves weren't updated. They seem to have fixed it now.
---
Haha I knew exactly who this would be before I clicked the thread. You're truly a madman, Juggs.
---
Yeah I have the same issue at the moment, literally as I was typing this they all came up. Should be working now.
---
I was able to log in now.. Try it again
---
EDIT: nvm, i got dc and cant log in anymore
---
Running scan tool know good to know it probably won't work
---
better than being 'that guy' that uses 'could of'
---
why would that even have to be a requirement? it's not like people who aren't 60 yet can never go to DM. But people who're 60 and bored now can go there now.
---
Besides, i hear this all over this thread and others as well. What is the source on "the avg lvl is 40-50 right now" Says who? does that include everyone who quit before lvl 10?
---
That type of shit is no life status. If you are already 60 and so geared that all you are doing it waiting on raid reset you play the game too much. Do something else. No fucking way should people like that dictate the pace of content being released.
---
server machine broke
---
Try updating your video card driver
---
why lol
---
I use tukui for that it's a whole UI overhaul though I turn a lot of it off
---
Obviously not all the realms have had layering removed but more and more every day are. Mine got the last layer removed yesterday and suddenly we were having long queues to get in which we haven't had for weeks.
---
Restarted my battle.net app works fine now
---
In the middle of reinstalling to see if it helps, I let the update run before I hit play but I guess that was a mistake lol
---
Edit: Reinstalling fixed it
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. Sorry for asking
---
Me too, it updated to version 1.13.2.32089
---
Orcs are pretty good as well 
---
(I am Undead Warlock)
---
Did a scan and it seems resolved maybe... "Logging into game server"
---
Fixed, but still can't log in. LOL
---
It's sink, as in a kitchen sink. Good on you for telling people what they should do with their time too!
---
It's up for me now. Go forth and conquer.
---
Lol.
---
I was ignored by someone who ‚Äùwas trying to be helpful‚Äù by spamming in lfg that The Battle for Darrowshire was bugged to the extent it couldn‚Äôt be completed (which it wasn‚Äôt), in response to me recruiting for that quest.
---
When I didn‚Äôt indulge his attention seeking in the chat, he /w‚Äôd me directly stating the same thing. My only response is ‚ÄùYes, I know. But I know what to do.‚Äù  Then he stated that he was ‚Äùonly trying to be helpful‚Äù, to which I explained that spamming the lfg-channel with ill-informed ‚Äùfacts‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exactly help me or my group. Apparently, that was offensive, and he announced that I‚Äôd be on his ignore list from now on.
---
It's a bad idea because Dire Maul was released more like 3 months after launch, not 6 weeks. They are speeding up the content release schedule too much.
---
This all day.  I would accept Cenarion Circle rep as a balm to this abomination.  Cleanse it with (moon/star)fire!
---
1s with talents tho
---
This worked for me: 
---
Close bnet, then open task manager and end the process for the blizzard update agent (or agent.exe). Then, reopen bnet and launch. After doing this, it finally works and i can play. 
---
Scan and repair, restarting etc did nothing
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right.
---
Atleast the last one was using the correct channel
---
 Why didn‚Äôt you take a screenshot? This is horrible
---
Yeah but this time around it was obviously going to be cleared fast. As stated somewhere else in this thread if Blizz just aims to satisfy the speedrunning hardcore players we will have Naxx by the end of the next year - people will start looking at P2 and wonder why we can't get BG's earlier..
---
I reckon No Changes was a good idea but I guess not.
---
Even a basic mana tracking weak aura will show your mana in form.  I set mine to change color from blue to orange/red when I'm at the point where I can no longer switch out of Cat (or Bear if you prefer)  and back in.
---
Might have something to do with layering, or the fact that most people are currently out in the world questing, farming professions, earning gold, wpvping, and running dungeons/raiding.
---
Usually you sac one of your pets for the buff(i think the succubus).  Then just shadowbolt until either you die or the boss does.
---
It's working now
---
How is it as fast as Enh?  I'm currently 5/x/14 which seems like the best possible
---
Yeah but some of these same people are whinging about how Blizzard are catering to no lifers by releasing DM early.
---
I don't care how long someone has to play but if you can only play a few hours a week that's on the person.  A 2 year cycle honestly won't work for Classic, there's not enough content and I think Blizzard are now seeing that.

They just patched the game. Don't freak out. Don't uninstall your game, don't uninstall bnet. Just wait.

As an undead lock, I spend hours every week ganking noobs in Redridge. I'll do a run around the zone, killing at least 20-30 noobs (usually 1 dot will do it), then hide underwater in that little gorge area and go afk, then rinse/repeat for a few hours. Amazing fun.
---
This subreddit is full of idiots that will never get around to actually playing endgame content, even though it's fucking simple. 
---
If you're not 60 by now, you likely wont even have enough time to have your pre-raid bis for Phase 2, you likely wont have time to raid 3 hours a week to clear MC with inefficient guilds that also don't have time to farm consumables, never work towards Ony attunement etc. You don't suddenly stop needing to do things at 60, if these people ever capped even on retail, they'd understand this.
---
If classic, on a fucking 4-month phase release cycle is going 'too fast' for you, you're not playing the game. I have a full time, 9-5 job (I took off the first week, however was stuck in queue for 1/2 of my scheduled playtime) and my fucking ALT is level 55. 
---
People need to realise very fast, what their priorities are. They shouldn't get a say on when endgame content is released when they have no intentions of ever playing it.
---
That‚Äòs basically what I‚Äòm talking about. If you play a lot, you login, do your checklist, but you can‚Äòt do anything else to progress once you‚Äòre done with that. And the checklist usually only takes a few hours. Players who play a lot (12+ hours a day) don‚Äòt have a lot to do

Follow the fix guide found here:  [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759446778?linkId=100000008445101#post-4](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759446778?linkId=100000008445101#post-4)

All I had to do was click on Options =&gt; Check for Updates in the Bnet client. Close your client and end any tasks on your machine called blizzard update or agent
---
Working again now for me!
---
Looks like it's fixed now!!!
---
EDIT: Appearances can be deceiving. Realms show medium, high, full instead of incompatible, but you still can't get in. Hangs on "logging in to game server", then DCs.
---
EDIT 2: Just got in. Looks like it might actually be fixed now.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for my lvl 55 mage water!!!!
---
Did the scan and repair off of here and they show up but now I d/c while waiting to connect. Maybe a whole bunch of people trying to get in breaking it
---
10/10 meme + jebait
---
Hey, I was there (Clicker). This was a lot of fun!
---
I got to this point to but have been dcd twice now
---
Nice. Glad I helped :)

Restarted [battle.net](https://battle.net) and it looks like they pushed a fix.
---
Your last paragraph is very true. The experience I wanted was already dead because we have the 1.12 versions of gear instead of the jank versions people were using on vanilla. I'll never understand why blizz used the final versions of gear from the start.
---
Bad advise.  It's server side.
---
This is way too soon &amp; DM gear is crazy.  I feel like this gives advantage to the people who rushed (or exploited) to 60.  The vast majority of the community wants to take their time and truly explore &amp; enjoy this game.  Please slow down patches - we only get to experience the ClassicWoW launch/progression once
---
And here I am killing everything red.  Sometimes I even wait till they are half health after fighting a mob.
---
A weird part of me would be okay with 2 at a time...means I can make more money idling in city.
---
Because what you are describing is "I want this for money". That is the direct definition of "Greed". It literally says it on the tin. You don't need that item. 
---
What you could spend that gold on is irrelevant if somebody could use that item instead.
---
50g an hour for BRD is bullshit youtube personalities put out. You have to get exceedingly lucky for that and any amount of resists tacks on at least 5 minutes unless you're respeccing for pickpocket runs. It's like 20-30g an hour, DM will beat that.
---
Ya I‚Äôm getting the same issue now
---
Amateurs.
---
Purge their disguise before they can talk to him.
---
Shit dude your grandma is super young, in her 50s????
---
Aww punkin.  Truth hurts, does it?   Or do you need a 15 year old accomplishment to matter that much?  Imagine meeting me and saying that.  ü§£
---
The realms no longer show as incompatible instead, I now get stuck at "logging in to game server" and am eventually disconnected.
---
Was having the same issue, finally able to login.
---
I am actually back in now after repair, not sure if it was related to it tho...
---
&gt;:(
---
This fixed it for me: 
---
Close bnet, then open task manager and end the process for the blizzard update agent. Reopen bnet launch, play. Nothing else worked for me.
---
What body part do i have to cut off myself to stop these posts
---
Hey Sanka, ya dead?
---
Did you try to log in? Just boots me back out.
---
I didn't factor the gender, interesting stuff!
---
Nice to know people don't need to addon!
---
Not with that attitude
---
Same. Hit 39 on my lunch break. I'm a family man now. I am having a blast reliving my teenage years but holy hell do I not want to be farmed while questing. I am only on a pvp server because my old wow friends rolled pvp. I don't mind pvp now but when I'm an honor target, yikes. I hope it's not what people say it will be. 48-60 will suck.
---
restart your battlenet client
---
The issue isn't the inflation itself - it's the fact that players who are level 60 already would have an even more significant advantage than before.
---
When the best available farms are only 30 g/hr the cost of not being level 60 is much lower than when the best available farms are 100 g/hr.
---
Is there an addon that shows the popularity of an item (item sold #) in the AH?
---
I read the whole thing for a good laugh.
---
Needs a stronger finish though.
---
it doesnt help
