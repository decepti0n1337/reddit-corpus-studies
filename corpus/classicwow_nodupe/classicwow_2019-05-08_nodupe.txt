I remember when they first introduced rain and someone was singing toto in chat but changed to “gotta bless the rains down in aaazeroth!”.  Early wow was just the best fucking gaming experience ever.
---
---
---
I don't know what I did to deserve this.
---
In the event of a tie, they would all qualify for the top bracket.
---
IIRC T1 and T2 favored resto, not feral.
---
Gonna be honest, as a raidleader if I've got guys banking on summons and not hustling to get where they need to be I'll usually tell the locks not to summon them (unless they have a good reason).
---
No, you let them burn while using the sarcastic healing macros so the raid knows they screwed up.
---
I'd ask the rogue/inspect to see if it's ok first. Shadowcraft is heavy on agility which favors rogues more than cats (str/agi). There's better/other gear a druid can sneak for cats/bears. BRD is heavy laden with solid feral gear.
---
Technically there’s an old god/void thing going on in every expansion.
---

---
Or their corpse is on the planet.
---
also the tabard is from the pre wotlk event iirc
---
As a paladin/Warrior, it really felt like you were a knight in a land of weak peasants.
---
Some of the BiS items listed here are nearly impossible to get - for example, the Archivist Cloak of xxxx stat is technically BiS for several classes/specs but nearly impossible to obtain unless you are extremely lucky, less than 1% chance of getting the specific stats you are looking for.
---
It's not helpful unless there is more than one item listed for each slot, because some of them require more effort than actual raiding.
---
*Laughs in Mage*
---
Well, since you asked nicely, here's a release date; &gt;!2nd of June.!&lt;
---
Give me another fact.
---
How deep can we go
---
Can we get the release date for the release date for the release date?
---
The last one "Good Night Moon".
---
Yeah that's what I was getting at. Though I don't remember one in BC
---
PvP gear really helps out the ferals, but that takes A LOT of work to do &gt;.&gt;
---
All the talk about what happens after naxx. Are people generally in favour of server reset and starting from scratch? Personally I think this would be a terrible idea
---
Maybe, it's where millions got their start.
---
No, I'm gonna play horde so no Goldshire Inn for me.
---
Not sure if I'll be maining a mage again, but one of the draws for me is the random ways you can be helpful to people.  (And I've always loved playing frost...).
---
AI buffs, food and water, and portal services can defnitely be annoying when required or when pestered.
---
Buffing random players in passing though is enjoyable.  Offering food and water to others at the same quest hub as you or out in the world.  Or for the best response...saving someone significant travel time when they didn't expect it.
---
And now I'm leaning back towards playing a mage again...
---
TBC has a corpse if I remember correct.
---
Also Ethereals are void entities. And there was that one dungeon. Macha something I think.
---
This. There will 100% be no post Naxx content created. Wow Classic is using as much automation as possible. This would easily be transferred to BC and possibly Wrath if it works out well. The other option is a reset.
---
I hope they do, BC was great, and Wrath as well. Nothing matches the feeling of Northrend. They captured, brilliantly, the foreboding cold, the dangerous wilderness, remoteness. I remember the perilous feeling of the trek through the giant cracked ice of Dragon Wastes. The woodsy camping feeling of Grizzly Hills. Some of the best zones to date.
---
I also hope they just keep refreshing Classic servers with new ones so the progression can start over like seasons, and if they decide to do BC/Wrath they make new servers and offer up free character transfers from Classic servers. Why shouldn't there be an expansion-locked version of WoW to meet everyone's tastes? That is one of the major problems with modern WoW, is that the old content is "thrown away" once the new content comes forward. Sure it ~exists~, but only leveling alts and collectors are "participating" in (soloing) it. It becomes irrelevant and largely just takes up space. Think of the money in terms of development time that wastes, as well. To keep making content than simply becomes mostly unplayed after a year or two? Leaving less overall for the players to enjoy as something meaningfully engaging on a current-basis.
---
Because anything that can be used as a football by the tauren does not a warrior make.
---
More like a 14 year old post

Flying mounts were definitely the one thing I thought I wanted but didn't. I realized this a few hours I got my first flying mount. Terrible game decision.
---
Same goes for the dungeon and raidfinder. Completely killed the game.
---
Astonishing contribution, mate.
---
If that video doesn't nothing will. If your friend has interest, he/she should at least try or check from time to time at how it looks during your playthrough. 
---
It lists pretty fundamental things, and it lists them well.
---
Man, it really makes you wonder what an experience it would be to sit on the shores of Darkshire and just watch the sky.
---
the warrior is atrocious lol
---
That's not what camping means
---
Was instant poison not in vanilla? People say that rogues couldn't use poison because debuff slots, but that shouldn't matter with instant poison
---
If you plan on spending most of your time at level 60: Practice. Playing on a progressed server will be different enough from classic to keep it interesting. ZG and AQ20 won't come out for at least a year in classic, but you can do those right when you hit 60 on a progressed server.
---
If you just want to play the game and level up at your own pace: Fresh. The questing experience doesn't change on a progressed server.
---
Same to you. This thread has definitely not been posted 500 times in the past.
---
He doesn't have "sources" he literally checks other people's datamining websites.
---
There's nothing wrong with that, but datamining websites don't spontaneously "leak". He's no more connected than you or I.
---
Fair point, I think that applies to all leveling classes. Druids going heals in a dungeon but needing on agi/str leather, same with shamans.
---
In 60 dungeons maybe a slightly different story for those classes, but warriors needing over hunters might still be the exception.
---
Aspect of the pack!
---
*A* release date... but is it... *the* release date?
---
hahaha this is also why you don't attack priests near cliffs
---
1 Mil players that *stay through Naxx*. A very important distinction.
---
Oh hell yes. Although the idea getting gold for the ground mount is already causing me a headache
---
BaTtLe FoR aZeRoTh Is NoT aBoUt OlD gOdS!

The image of a naked paladin bubble hearthing in the middle of a disaster that he caused is... perfect.
---
Instant poison was in vanilla - it was also one of the first learned with the level 20 quest! :)
---
It was a joke. Also, doing dungeons, any dungeon, while leveling is fun no matter if it is optimal or not. I didn't worry about it then, I'm not going to worry about it now. I just want to enjoy this game we've been waiting for fucking years to get back. No sense rushing to end game as fast as humanly possible, it's not going anywhere. A few dungeons here and there to get some cool blues to make leveling feel better isn't going to make or break my ability to participate in raiding.
---
i would actually welcome this if they kept the same audio
---
like that voice over is vanilla , the graphics could use a bump up in resolution
---
dont want anything changed but a few extra pixels to make it look nice would be ok.
---
but i feel if they re did the intro they would change the voice over or sound and i dont want that
---
the sound of vanilla was really good and stands up today  but more than anything it would feel like a different game if they change sound
---
I used to get infinity sapped in BB before the patch :(
---
I hope they finish the Eranikus questline.
---
Always hated it. When Sunwell came out and you were on that small island with those choke points and enemy faction...no flying, no hiding. It was great. 
---
BC class tuning was NOT perfect, but it was lightyears ahead of Classic, including the itemization. Its kinda poo wearing 90% cloth/leather as a fucking paladin. Ruins the entire class fantasy
---
From what you've described, classic is probably an excellent (or at least superior) fit. The environment is both geographically and thematically smaller - designed for new adventurers cutting their teeth in a hostile and unpredictable world. Retail WoW is oriented around legendary heroes with a trail of conquests (and literal gods) in their wake. It makes sense canonically but can be intimidating or even uninteresting for new players to approach.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
However, I think your enjoyment of Vanilla will depend greatly on how calibrated your expectations are. You will die, a **lot**. For a veteran player who knows the world and every quest they plan to take on their way to 60, 5 days /played is a pretty solid leveling time. For new players I would expect that to be *at least* doubled, so you're looking at well over 200 hours into the game before you finish your first character. There are a number of ways in which this might not pose a problem - maybe you read the quest text and try to immerse yourself in the lore along the way, maybe you don't view level cap as an objective but rather an achievement, maybe you look for other focuses like professions to help temper the slog. There are a multitude of ways to play the game and different people find enjoyment from each. But if you are a powergamer who expects to be part of the earliest raids or have their name feared across battlegrounds, it's fairly likely you will be disappointed.
---
Overall, I think you and your friends will enjoy the experience and would highly recommend that you give it a try. It can be particularly fun to experience as a group, especially if you try to do dungeons along the way.
---
Now I'm really curious... I remember stunning higher level players to escape, specially in front of instances, etc.  
---
I love the idea of lvl 60s getting harassed by lvl 40s lol
---
Classic is pretty much the greatest MMO adventure anyone could ask for. Some say the real game starts at 60, so you won't get bored.
---
WE GET FRESHHHHHHHH
---
Welcome to Vanilla
---
Hey there, thanks a lot for you interest in our guild. You sound like the exact person we're looking for. To your ask: it just so happens that our raid leader has claimed our shadow priest raid roster spot, and I'd hate to be the one who ruined your dream of going full on PvE shadow priest. I would have no problem having another shadow priest of high skill, but unfortunately the 16 debuff slot sometimes makes it hard to bring 2 during progression, so I don't think I could always 100% guarantee you a spot as shadow. However, our biggest need is in fact for a holy priest if you did want to claim that spot for most progression raids, then switch to shadow once the raid is on farm. With our focus being on PvP as much as it is PvE, another shadow priest would wonderful for us to have, but I understand if you want to fulfill the dream of being shadow 100% of the time for all situations.
---
If you're still interested, you're more than welcome to come check out our server and see what we're all about, we'd love to have you guys.
---
[Here's the wowhead page.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=142273/ensemble-blackened-defias-armor)
---
Just imagine: Phase 1 pvp with sheep and no trinkets far and wide to be seen. Ohboiohboiohboi!!!
---
Why "god please no"??? Whats so bad about going on with the classic servers with BC?
---
Regardless, you will see threads popping up all over the forums and reddit asking for TBC or more content pretty much indefinitely until something is announced.
---
100% agree. 
---
Especially since making friends in vanilla is necessary to progress through group quests and form dungeons faster, that friendlier mindset is just more suited imo. 
---
One of my best times on a RP realm was every saturday there were like 5-6 people roleplaying as vendors selling portals, pots, BoEs, enchants for really cheap or for a trade.
---
Always made going to Stormwind worth it. I miss those days ;(
---
Anecdotal of course, but here's my experience.
---
In all of the expansions of WoW that I played, I was able to meet and interact with wonderful, helpful, and friendly people.
---
The social aspect has always been there, but in earlier days it was more forced and enforced.  (You had to be social to get through quests, dungeons, etc.  If you were a jerk and acted poorly, you earned a reputation to match.)
---
Now, as far as helpful, this also changed over the years.  The people I met early on in WoW had a more 'let's do it together' or 'let me teach you' approach.  Over the years it changed more to 'here are the resources you can look at to learn, and let me just powerlevel you through a whole bunch of content really fast and give you a massive headstart with gold and gear and bags'.
---
Both are nice, but if you want to learn the roots of the game and the game world, you'll definitely get more time to do that in classic, rather than just blowing through it and the next few expansions in no time at all.  (Not that people won't still powerlevel their friends or give them great stuff...but there's a bit of a difference between a level 60 with classic gold levels and a level 100+ that can drop a few hundred gold without thinking while giving you cheap items from across several expansions).
---
&gt; Destruction isn't really a thing and it's only used for ZG, AQ and Naxx   
---
Well I mean this is entirely false.
---
It will take a regular player two year or more before they have the gear and skill to do naxx given thier guild does not disband at any point. To clear naxx will take a very long time, even the best guilds in the world in vanilla had a lot of trouble with it. I can bet each phase of the 6 phases will be about 3 months apart so at the very least naxx will not be out for over a year from phase 1. The top guilds or players from private servers who switch to classic may clear it all fast but 90% of each server will struggle just like in vanilla
---
Rank 11
---
If you roll alliance and are competitive about meters in raids, you will regret not rolling human. The small amount of weapon skill IS really relevant. I'll be rolling human since meters is basically what I play wow for next to the social aspect. Enjoy!
---
I played enhancement in Vanilla and fake healed raids MC, Ony, BWL, AQ20 and ZG. BC came out as we were doing AQ40.
---
Dungeons - Any role anytime. All are fun in 5mans, especially enhancement (Unstoppable Force crits omg).
---
Raids - I stayed enhancement and was tossed into various groups for wf/mana/tremor totems while fake healing with chain heal mainly. On trash I used to swap to my 2h and wail on mobs. Actually did solid dps but the debuff means you can't Stormtrike bosses :/.
---
Lemme know if you have questions or w/e.
---
Stance dancing makes you feel like a martial artist. There's nothing more intimidating than a geared warrior that knows their shit. :D
---
What happens after naxx? You do naxx again next week
---
Yep, anyone who cares enough about gearing will probably know that shadowcraft isn't really that great.
---
Endgame goal is to have BiS on every class, except Paladins, filthy Alliance.  Unobtainable? No, but unlikely yes.
---
Going to be playing this game a long time.
---
Unless you plan to clear all PvE content, playing Ele Shaman is fine. You might still have to heal in raids though in a 30/0/21 spec. Most guilds will also take 1 SP to raids. Getting that spot is hard, but not impossible.
---
  
---
I generally recommend checking out class guides on YouTube.
---
[deleted]
---
Commander* you mean?
---
The video itself says Rank 11 &gt;.&gt;
---
Shadowcraft isnt prebis for any class so yeah you're good
---
In vanilla, we would occasionally go \~6 hours, but never longer.  
---
Also that raiding schedule was for learning raids that no one knew how to do yet. (like Vael, week 1)
---
its a pretty social game but tbh i think the pace will be too slow for a lot of younger gamers
---
im guessing seeing people play on twitch will be enough to get them to push through
---
Upvote for that reference good sir hehe
---
I'm thinking about rolling shaman and don't really know what totem placement looks like for PVE, especially raids. Are you constantly having to replace totems when players move or are totems typically so circumstantial that you are'nt placing that many to begin with?
---
I'm sure it depends on the encounter-just kind of curious about it in general.
---
Can we just have a game that has a lifespan that isn't tied to elite progression? Not everyone wants to rush to the end of a game, and not everyone wants the game to change once they have.
---
I still boot up my SNES and N64 games and play through them all the time. Can you imagine if I couldn't play Ocarina of Time anymore just because people finished it and wanted more?
---
I would love it if Classic WoW was a permanent fixture. I don't want a time limit.
---
Yeah, it's not a twofer sorta deal, and I wasn't keen on respeccing. I could always run the Fury alt in raid spots when the Spriest slot was taken, but if said Spriest is the raid leader, that seems like it would be every single raid. I already had my fill of Holy in Vanilla, too.
---
I'll still keep you in mind if I decide to raid with the Warrior instead, though. I'm around in this sub often as of late, so I'm sure to see your post again.
---
Lots of classes want their tier bonuses. Realistically the majority of players end up wearing their class sets. Some of the BiS items are rare enough that you might see it drop a couple times a year, or you have to compete with 10 other people in your role. By the time you get the rare T1-BiS boots you're likely to have T2. There might be another rare BWL item that's better than T2, but by the time you get it you're likely to be working on T2.5 or T3.
---
Right so by poisons, they mean any other poison?
---
Mainly because shamans are one of the only healers with spammable aoe. it was one of their defining characteristics so it was emphasized by devs.
---
What would like to see is a fork in the storyline. So maybe something they wanted to do but scrapped. An alternative timeline if you will.
---
The bottom bar for player skill is miles above what is was back then, though, I don't really think  it will be anything like release at all
---
I totally understand it’s all good brother, if you do decide to go warrior, we’d love to have you.
---
This. Yes.
---
I think it was the gold, then changed to red to make way for heirloom items being gold, then returned to gold in Legion as heirlooms got changed to light blue.
---
\&gt;I personally enjoy the old design philosophy over the current one   
---
same, I hate the way every class now feels like a fighting game character, where you have to spam buttons every gcd
---
Hell yeah dude. Makes every slow step to 40 worth it once you get there. Now that's what I call character progression!
---
Ah so that's why I'm hallucinating and having seizures on the daily. It all makes sense now
---
If you can do heroic cata dungeons pre-nerf, then you can do Naxx.
---
I honestly have virtually no interest at all in Wrath if there aren't significant changes, LFR/LFG does not belong in classic in anyway, also 10/25 man raiding was almost as bad, it broke up the raiding scene WAY too much.
---
&gt; It's litterally the lowest priority for blizzard right now.
---
Care to back any of that up?
---
There will probably be people trying to make a system so they can throw a few ads on their associated website and make a little money.
---
I'm just hoping the community as a whole refuses to adopt it.
---
Retail WoW has become worse and worse over time. It's not a game I would recommend to new players anymore. It's also definitely too "big" now, and about 90% of the content is dead content (in that almost nobody is doing it) beyond old raid transmog runs.   
---
Would definitely give classic a try instead if i were you.
---
LFR wasn't in Wrath though...
---
none of the racials help the class, and their base strength is lower than the other races. they're fine just not optimal.
---
I played Vanilla and then BC back in the day and don't really have experiences with other expansions. Flying mounts even in BC destroyed world PVP (after the initial leveling period) and a sense of vastness in the world. Sure the old world still didn't allow flying mounts, but in BC, you rarely did anything in the old world except maybe go to capital cities.
---
Nagrand gave us some decent PVP but that was purely voluntary and you can just res and fly away whenever you wanted. This was a farcry from the dangers of Vanilla WoW where even if you mounted up after you res'd, you probably weren't getting away because you'd aggro mobs as you leave and get dazed/dismounted.
---
Can confirm. Lvl 6 and got "epic boots". I logged out.
---
To be fair, Warlords has some of the worst map design for ground traversal. Stormheim and Highmountain are equally bad without it, but outside of Talador, WoD is awful to move around on foot.
---
\#NoFlyZones
---
And if it's a Hunter we'd rather you buff our Pet than us!
---
People regularly desire things that aren't good for them.
---
I've always thought Escape Artist was amazing though.
---
You can if you want to. Probably be faster/easier to just grind it out though
---
In a 40 man raid yes you can't use deadly poison. That's probably all they mean.
---
You're right, my bad, for some reason I thought that was added at the end of Wrath, but that was Cata.
---
Any poison that consumes a debuff slot (Deadly Poison, Wound Poison, Crippling Poison). Instant poison does not consume a debuff slot as it is just a single proc that doesn't leave a debuff. :D
---
Shaman requires 140 IQ or higher, dont even consider them unless you have a PhD (preferably in economics or chemistry). Also because they are horde you should be middle aged and disagree with the progressive agenda. Lastly it requires a dedication in both body and spirit. This means you must keep a body fat percentage under 10% AT ALL TIMES or you will be removed. A strong spirit is one who assumes the dominant postion in both groups and real life. So CEO's, business owners, and truck drivers get first dibs.
---
TBC had these birds in SMV summoning a C’Thun-like creature, so at least there was a cult connected to them or similar creatures.
---
Why wouldn't it be? It's so far in the future. I'm sure they've talked about some ideas in passing but I highly doubt they have anything concrete. They're going to be largely focused on just releasing the damn game first, not what comes after it.
---
I'm from the EU (until Brexit happens I guess...) but I live in Japan so I'll be playing on NA servers. Anyway I've set up late night NA guild for anyone who wants to play in NA early AM.
---
If 6 or 7 AM UK time raids sound more manageable than 4AM ones, feel free to apply!
---

That hurt my soul.
---
In wow, when it's night time in real life is it night in the game as well?
---
Any given levelling dungeon will go from very hard and slow to very easy and fast if you go there as 1-2 levels above the end boss instead of 1-2 levels below the end boss. Especially the tank.
---
Shadow is faster than ret, by a pretty large margin I’d say. It is mostly wanding, shadow word pain, and an occasional mind blast , but it’s a much more efficient rapid way of killing than meleeing.
---
IDK really it's better than dwarf IMO but people do it anyway
---
Human is for meters for sword skill...It's best in raid
---
Dwarf has stoneskin Gnome has escape artist
---
I am so unbelievably hyped for classic. I can’t wait!
---
I suppose you could make the case for Thaddius, I don’t think people will ever get the polarities right.
---
another thing that scares me is level 120.  
---
Hot the hell should we reach fucking level 120? we want to enjoy the game with quests, loots and dungeons.  
---
We want to understand the game.  
---
Whoulnd it take years to do (nearly) everything with one character?  
---
We like enggaming but how to play in (nearly) the same league with people how played the game for the past 10years?  
---
I know this feel when i played a game a lot then there is this "i just buyed this high level charater"-guy who is just a retard at max level
---
As long as it’s not released like 5 months after naxx hits, like they did originally, we’re good.
---
Rank 1 fort gottem
---
I'm excited for the fishing. I just want to go back to my old lakes and fish and listen to music and talk about silly things in guild chat.
---
Hell yeah you can, some of the pieces like boots and head are actually second to BiS for tanking in Phase 1 and 2 so go for it.
---
4. PvP if ur gonna have a lot of time for sure, if ur very time limited PvE can make for better short play sessions. Takes time to get ur vengeance on a pvp server
---
My Tauren warrior on Illidan made it to rank 10 before the burnout hit me.  I really wanted to push further but I was still in college and ranking was just brutal.
---
Tauren looks really good in it :)
---
Need - bop recipes/stuff for your proffs
---
Greed - anything boe
---
This allows for everyone to act accordingly without "ninjaing" anything. You can always ask the group before you roll. Say Crusader drops, "Hey, I'm an enchanter \*links enchanting\*, mind if I roll need?" If it's not unanimous, I would roll greed. Most of the time, the group will let you grab a boe recipe and learn it. If they do, learn it immediately after receiving it or your rep might suffer.
---
Eventually it will get to BFA, right? Though by then BFA might as well be the good old wow everyone is nostalgic about. Remember the heart of azeroth grind?
---
It's pretty important for pvp. Just the grenades make a big difference. For PvE no one really cares, it's just an extra thing the 1% can do.
---
No I’m not. I do know there are limits to summoning via warlock. Definitely had issues with that in the past on private servers, where we’d have a higher level friend come help for a dungeon and the warlock couldn’t summon.
---
So many, I love everything about the lush verdant jungle of Un'Goro. Most recently it has been running through the Barrens in spirit wolf form and looking up at the moon and stars, experiencing the majestic ambiance. It feels mysterious; like freedom.
---
Surely this will be the case, a lot of people on this sub sound like crazy old doomsayer's with nothing but speculation.
---
Take out flying mounts and do things to amp up faction hatred beyond the gates. There should be a huge wall separating the neutral city instead. No blood elves... No shamans on alliance. More world PvP that has an impact on a factions influence and ability in a region. The only way
---
Mythic Raiding.
---
Mages and priests used to routinely roll on dreadmist for their pre-BG pvp set. I don't see how this would be any different.
---
The key really is to ask before the run starts. If there's a rogue in your group just make sure they are OK with it.
---
Saaaaaame dude. I spent 3 weeks with a few friends a while back and only got to around lvl 20ish, but chatting with ppl that actually gave a fuck about the game, having some actual challenge in lvling, and having cool lore moments made it so memorable. I know Classic will be great because I've already tasted it and it was vanilla delicious-ness.
---
While I agree with the rest of your post, this is so NOT an experiment.  They at least have the generic data from some of the private servers and know their audience base with scientific accuracy.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have a dedicated team to support this style of server for a time to come.
---
Any content after vanilla needs to be on its own servers imo, so we can play thru tbc or whatever, but still have vanilla to live on forever.
---
Probably not but I would be interested to see what it looked like. Plus they could add other classes into the intro and show class fantasy cinematics for full-hype inducement.
---
They sure as fuck do and did. They did in vanilla and they do on private servers.
---
TBH after rewatching the clip it sounded more like he was tired of people constantly asking, and was trying to justify their previous decision to not do it.
---
If i had my way it would be raining 85% of the time.
---
Right.
---
Statistically (though it obviously depends on where you live), your car/house won't get robbed if you leave the doors unlocked. Doesn't mean you shouldn't take basic precautions and lock the doors.
---
I'm much more interested in the game just being classic forever. Who cares about post nax? I'm here to play classic and hope there isn't an expiration date.
---
Wait how is this twice the spyware than the Blizzard client itself?  
---
Far as I'm aware Blizzard client does everything that steam or even origin does
---
But they go out their way for the mobile app.
---
That might actually be cool.
---
It is the beginning. So of course!
---
Heyo, peeps. Call me BadKarma (you'd better; it's my Battle Tag).
---
I'm not 100% set on returning to Classic since I previously swore off MMOs forever, but the one exception I made when swearing off MMOs forever was if Blizzard made Classic servers, and Blizzard is making classic servers, so now is now. And then will be soon.
---
If I do return, I'll be looking for a US-based (preferably EST) PvP server Horde guild dedicated to both high level PvE and PvP and more specifically, one that will allow me to be the token special snowflake Shadowpriest in raids. I played Priest extensively during Vanilla up through the majority of Naxx (before my guild broke up lol), but said guild never allowed me to fulfill my boyhood dream of being a raiding Spriest and compelled me to spec Disc/Holy. What's the point in reliving the glory days if not to pretend that they were better than they were?

To wit, my brother will also be playing as a Frost Mage, and we intend on rolling a Warrior (I can offtank for raids if necessary) and Warlock alt respectively. On top of us both having similar PvE experience, we were also Gladiator-level PvPers in BC and Wrath, so having a PvP contingent within the guild is highly desired, and we'd be highly desired teammates. Ideally we'd like to raid on weekend times, but weekday raid hours work; he might simply miss out on some weeks due to a prior commitment of his.
---
We're both extremely knowledgeable and competent players, so if your Hardcore or Semi-Hardcore guild wants some Warlock DPS buffs and more conjured crystal water to wash down all that late-night salt, give me a holler. And we may well bring some friends with us if we can convince them to make the same horrible life choice as we do.

I once saw Stitches stomping along when I was on my Orc Rogue. I was headed to Deadmines to go after the Blackened Defias set and I decided to take him out. He kicked my ass and I had to Vanish before he killed me.
---
I was 60 and in partial Shadowcraft.
---
You’re correct. I snapped this while swimming in Lordamere Lake.
---
I kind of wish I could know the flavor of the community before committing to one. It would help since on day one choosing a server is difficil.
---
are RP servers even confirmed?
---
What happens after Naxx? Run it again the next week. If they add content to Classic WoW, it ceases to be Classic WoW.
---
Seems utterly insane if you did need BFA. That's never been their policy with prior expac access, and gating Classic behind a flat fee for the BFA expac would utterly kill any hope Blizzard has of luring in once-defunct subscribers.
---
Whatever floats your boat. I’m not investing any time in leveling or raiding at the moment, personally. Part of the appeal of Classic is having that permanence of your work.
---
Vidas and his beeldings that he owned!
---
Fuck he was ridiculed for years after this.
---
-Sincerely a classic KT player
---
I wouldn't be too worried about it. BWL doesn't really require MC gear, it's fine with blues if you have the core tank/healers/dps well geared. Phases after BWL come with ZG20/AQ20 which are great catch-up raids that mean someone hitting 60 late can be ready for AQ40 just with 20 mans and an odd BWL run.  
---
The thing is for the good guilds week 1 or 2 clearing raids as they release they will gear up very fast, and will be easily able to gear up a new player that comes later on. If you can meet their raids times and get out of the fire then you can get into good guilds. Gear doesn't really matter - it's an easy fix.
---
You won't. Classic WoW's level cap is 60. It has nothing to do with BFA, and the "past 10 years" of WoW has nothing to do with Classic. They might as well be separate games in terms of mechanics, metagaming, and community continuity.
---
Now here's the thing- and this is what happened to 07scape, I would not mind *at all* if they devoted a separate creative team to this to make new content. There are plenty of avenues and backlore to build on. Though they may just end up slowly updating expansions after a great while, who knows.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Just play a mage and set your hearth to where you’re questing right now. No need to keep it in a city.
---
Platinum WoW
---
Dude go PvE. I am assuming the RP servers are a unique breed and if you’re not in on the role play you’ll sort of ruin it for them. I honestly have no idea-just my 2 cents.
---
I'm still not sure what class I'm gonna roll
---
But you're really selling mages to me
---
They could always treat it like war mode, if you have flight mode enabled you can only see and interact with other people that have it enabled.
---
This way both types of users are represented.
---
yes
---
Speaking as someone who often defends retail on this sub... I don't think we have to worry about people missing BfA.
---
I feel the same way, back then I was stoked about it. Looking back on it it’s very clear it was a poor choice.
---
I believe you just need a normal WoW account. So even if you had a WoW account that has been dormant, it’ll automatically have all expansions up to Legion I believe. 
---
You would pay for that account which would grant you access to WoW Classic.
---
I'd have to say EA. I haven't had any shitty experiences with ActiBlizz, but I sure have with EA.
---
I used to use mind control so I could buff poor alliance lowbies while I was out in the world.
---
Depends what server time is, where it's based. It has a full day/night cycle. Too bad there isn't seasons with longer / shorter days
---
Right!? The game isn't even out yet and everyone wants to move on away from it already.
---

---
Thanks for your work friend
---
The main reason I’m going pally lol
---
If they go down the TBC route we go in full circle and create the same problems. Classic needs to stay separate from retail to be its “own success”.
---
You want flying you’ll always have retail and that’s cool. 
---
You want lvl 60 and that slower pace, we got that too.
---
Why I'm hoping they don't go the OSRS route and let people vote on things.
---
The changes that Blizzard implemented were stuff that people were whining for on the forums from 2005-2010. I know because I was there, getting drowned out by them. Anyone arguing against welfare epics, easy raids, class streamlining, etc... was treated like a butthurt neckbeard "hardcore" nolifer. I quit in wotlk and looks like I was the casual all along, because only a "hardcore" would play the boring grindfest that it looks like WoW turned into.
---
Can’t wait to buy a mount at 40 and then 60... classic may not be the game we all want due to changes but it will definitely be better than retail. Just knowing there are no DHs or pandas make it worth it.
---
forgot about naax, what happens after naax??
---
this would actually be horrible
---
For me I hope they kind of progress through the expansions as they did with retail but modify them to be like classic. The lore is already written so creating basically another timeline wouldn’t sit right with players no matter how much they do or don’t like the current story. But you give that iffy story a mountain of a quality game to back it up and it’s actually worth playing.
---
The same retards asking this are the people who will never even complete BWL. Just fuck off.
---
Nah, I’m only kidding. I main’d a rogue, and I wouldn’t mind. Druids are a rogues best friend. You can 3-man dungeon farm
---
Because you’re saying it’s okay to repeat the same mistakes. If all we get is a cycle through “classic” servers we are slowly yes but surely going to run into the same problem, another 15 years later the same call for “classic 2.0” to come back.
---
Classic needs to be its own thing separate from retail. Like osrs and rs3. Keep classic basically as its own game using vanilla as its base.
---
Yeah, he is an absolute unit.  Always fun when the whole zone would show up to try though
---
Being a mage engineer is the most convenient way to play mobility-wise. Well, it still is.
---
Nah I’m only kidding, as a rogue I wouldn’t mind. We are more focused on the one-off items. Shadowcraft is just backup.
---
When TBC came out, I was probably 2 years from stepping foot in Naxx
---
Doubt it, seems like you just need anactive sub. You can play all the previous as long as you have a sub IIRC.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of taste, as well.

Here's one for Days Gone. Good game, despite the mixed reception
---
https://imgur.com/a/dvBMrvH
---
I really hope they won't do anything to Classic servers after that. In case of BC servers after that I hope they leave Classic on, and just allow to copy your Classic characters (in state on date of release) to BC (or no copy/transfer at all).
---
I really don't think flying was a mistake at all,  I played for about a month in legion and bfa, and world pvp was still pretty dead despite the fact that nobody could fly.  Everybody just wants to get their dailies done.  Nobody fights anything that isn't a free win.  If I started fights my allies would join in, but otherwise it was almost always just "peacefully questing" alongside the alliance.  I think it's naive to blame flying for the death of world pvp.
---
I really enjoyed flying in tbc, though I only played for the first \~50% so that might have had an effect.  World pvp in wotlk was pretty dead and I'm willing to blame flying for that one, but I enjoyed world pvp quite a bit during tbc.  I have a lot of good memories of pvp on the netherwing ledge and nagrand, especially.
---
I was one of the first players on my server to grab epic flying, and there was a good chunk of time where I just spent hours hunting 60% flight speed players on my mage.  Doesn't matter how high you fly if I'm moving 400% faster.  That shit was fun, but I've always been a pretty bloodthirsty "if its red its dead" player, so I guess if you're looking for organic, fair 1v1s, then flight did remove those to some degree.  I don't really think proper world pvp is about being fair, though.
---
I do think that if they could have found a way to dismount players from flying mounts it could've gone a long way towards fixing things, though.  Breaking on any damage might have been a bit much, but it \*also\* would have required you to either fly low or have a slow-fall effect if you wanted to be "out of reach" at the top of the skybox.  Flying was definitely too safe, and there were very few reasons for being at a death-by-falling height unless you were just trying to avoid players.
---
It's important to get 60 ASAP so you can wait around for warriors and healers to catch, and then realize the first batch were all power leveled by their friends and won't group with you. This should leave a good couple weeks for you to go back to all the low level zones and level the profs you should have done anyways.
---
Server reputation being crucial to your experience on said server.
---
There is no 'base set of wow' anymore. Its just bfa and a subscription. That being said you will only need an active wow sub to play classic.
---
I’d prefer they add content post naxx, blizzard have confirmed they think flying was a mistake (though bc/wotlk it was in its best state) but still it’s the same mistake eventually.
---
We should keep classic separate from retail, I just don’t want to see a repeat and eventually the same call for “classic” to come back
---
Any content past Naxx, needs to build on current content and not reset everything to a leveling playing field basically rendering everything in the past useless and unplayable.   
---
Level 70 should be level 70 and not level 120.
---
I was way more social when I was playing Classic WoW lol. All my friends played as well and it was our way of "hanging out." While the people who talked down to me for spending so much time on a video game were getting hooked on drugs and/or pregnant, I spent time in Azeroth. Well worth it.
---
If the world feels too big and the story is hard to get into, then yeah consider starting with Classic. The vanilla storyline was mostly removed from the game in the third expansion (Cataclysm), when they revamped the main world. That might be way it feels so disjointed. Outland and Northrend also take place BEFORE the events of the main two continents because their respective expansions and storylines came out before the Cataclysm revamp.
---
Vanilla wow and the current modern game are also different in nearly every way, so if you keep playing Legion/BFA, don't take any expectations of gameplay, story, class mechanics, etc with you because everything is drastically different in vanilla/classic.
---
Alliance filth.
---
That's strictly a private server thing. A certain server has a 15 level limit on the ability, and another has a bug affecting summoning within dungeons if the party member is 5+ levels lower. Vanilla had no level restrictions on summoning.
---
This is still a thing in retail
---
Now this is the type of content YouTube is missing.
---
It's a minor inconvenience, and they'll just counter-gank harder at 60 because of it. Real pvp is actually fun.
---
Have you list your *mind,* u/DeusVult76?
---
Lol but that's only because people become extra lazy when there's a lock in the group. Having a lock in retail is saving everyone at max like 1-2 minutes of walking. In classic having a lock can save people like 10-20 minutes of travel time. It's orders of magnitude more important to have a warlock in the group in classic.
---
*tear* bring me home
---
big brain
---
My man!
---
I’m on the “just enjoy classic for what it is” and don’t ask too many more questions until closer to the time.
---
I’d personally like them to continue to add content to classic and further increase the content within that 60 level cap.
---
Ion has said he would love to do a level squish in retail but understands it’s a bit hard with all the expansions, they’ve admitted flying is mechanic that eventually turned into a big mistake. 
---
I don’t want to watch the game go through the same cycles and eventually make the same mistakes so 15 years in the future we are wanting vanilla again. Remember eventually even BFA might be considered a “classic expansion” in 20 odd years (given that wow is still pumping then) 
---
I want a true vanilla experience till Naxx then after I’m open to further content not just tbc again.
---
Name checks out.
---
I will be really disappointed if there is anything post naxx. Bis naxx forever is a new game.
---
Naw people are lazy no mater what. No warlock in the group? Summonstone Pls.
---
This is what I'm hoping happens
---
I told some of my friends who I used to play WoW with the same thing. Some disagreed (they dont play WoW anymore), and some agreed and are going to play Classic with me. :)
---
tbh i think it still holds up.
---
we already have AU Draenor, no reason we can't have AU Azeroth with similar expansions. This could let them do whatever they want with the lore really so no reason they would have to follow the same lore from past expansions. Could technically jump straight to the Legion storyline or WoTLK or something. 
---
And yes, I completely agree, I hope classic becomes it's own thing with unique new content eventually. WoW 2 essentially.
---
Troll rogue with maces. I am claiming the Empyrean Demolisher as my birthright.
---
Still.. Even if they had the files it doesnt seem likely. Getting 15 year old projects to open and work with current versions of plugins, licensing those old versions etc. would be a pain. I doubt they will redo this.

That should keep you occupied :)
---
Yeah. I sincerely doubt they're going to shoot themselves in the foot here. I dislike sharding as much as the next guy, but as long as they maintain the idea that it's only the early zones and only for a short time, that's *fine.*
---
Well they can't change the audio. Seeing as Tony Jay is dead.
---
I was hoping the best feature of classic would be no sharding technology....oh well
---
Or we just put up with a *temporary* evil with sharding, and then get 100% vanilla afterwards.
---
By the time I was interested in trying EQ2 it had grown so much, had so many new characters, races, lands, etc, that I lost interest. I suspect WoW is equally as daunting to get into for a lot of new players. Going back to basics will hopefully be just what the franchise needed.
---
Nah, it would either be very cold or very hot.
---
Played on a high pop PvE private server, there was a moderate amount of rogues, bout the same as dps warriors and mages.
---
We have Burning Crusade.  The idea they'll develop more level 60 raid content is a complete pipe dream.
---
I'm hoping that *if* Classic is considered successful and *if* they decide to add progression, they make new expansion packs based on the old ones (or something new entirely) but still keep Vanilla as the base game. Just because it takes place in Azeroth (for now) doesn't mean that it has to follow the same progression as the original.
---
The fact that it'll be completely free for people already playing retail definitely leads me to believe there'll be a large "tourist" wave. A lot of those people like retail's gameplay, and no matter how good Classic will be, they won't be won over by a game ten times slower.
---
Will it be feasible to find a guild on a NA server that raids during weekday daytime hours (i.e., 8AM-5PM EST between Mon-Fri)?
---
Or will it be too hard to find a critical mass of reliable people (either 40 or 20)?
---
Fucking flex tape...oh lets look at how amazing it is for being able to hold back like 0.50psi of water pressure!

They all look like they belong in wc3 lol.
---
I just enjoy the leveling and roleplaying in classic. If they keep classic for an indefinite time, the goal will be 50 max characters
---
Meh. Class homogenization is up there.
---
Yeah, i just quit half way through. I honestly dont remember the specifica of each dire maul wing, etc lol. It's been a while.
---
I'm looking forward to playing with all my old friends, who are by and large avid RPers. Several of them are eagerly awaiting classic as well, so I expect I will probably be playing on an RP realm. I don't RP or engage in anything even remotely similar outside of WoW. Not in other games, I don't play D&amp;D or anything like that, and while I did RP for years on retail, I don't plan on getting back into it this time around for a number of [reasons.](https://reasons.So) So, like many other players on RP realms, I will probably be playing on one, but I won't be RPing while I'm there. I'll of course be respectful of other players and their immersion, I just won't be telling any stories.
---
Yeah.... I was excited to do the survey and then when I saw the layout..
---
"Dipped in shit! New meat! You dudes gonna love the Nahm.. For fucking ever!.. And a wake up!"
---
TBC, obviously.
---
Tomb of Sargeras was the final raid of legion
---
Yup, it's worked great for os runescape. I'd be completely fine with new content so long as it fits with the classic wow theme. The chances that they go that route are slim but it would be pretty cool. If anything I think they're more likely to re-release BC after like 3 years which I'd also be totally fine with
---
Yep, same here.
---
Pretty sure you will still be in Europe. We tried to kick Mexico out of North America but it just doesn't work that way.
---
So what I don’t get is this, if Classic is as successful as we hope it will be... why not make servers for the BC expansion and people can choose to port their characters over or stay on Classic?
---
Legion is the "base game" now and it's free. Every account has it at minimum, even brand new ones. You add a subscription and that's it.
---
Actually the general thought is that Agility is better for feral over strength. 
---
This new way of thinking has come up in the last few years on private servers.
---
I’ve always liked the look of that set.
---
X = Scepter of the Shifting Sands Questline
---
\&gt; Did you guys really hate flying that much at the time?   
---
I did. It was a cool novelty for a few days but some problems quickly became apparent and some other problems started revealing themselves within a few weeks. Within a month of getting my flying mount I loathed it.
---
The only thing I worry about for the longevity of the game is the economy. The economy is such a big part of what classic wow was to me and idk how it will be years after release. Hopefully they will open new servers kind of like seasons in diablo every once in a while so people that want a fresh start can do so
---
New season!!
---
It would be nice. I played on Moon Guard and Wyrmrest Accord on retail for years and each community was tangibly different. Neither was better or worse than the other, but they approached certain things differently. One was more relaxed while the other was more... "by the book" I'd say, neither is a bad thing, but it'd be nice to know beforehand which community you're joining and whether you'll be happy there. I know some people were on the "wrong" server and kinda felt like a square peg in a round hole.
---
I was an awful, awful Retnoob in Vanilla. I still had a blast. The MMO portion really made the game immersive and addictive. Retail is a fine RPG, but there are better out there if that's all you want.
---
I wrote about this on Wowhead: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/shaman-totems-classic-wow hope this helps!
---
That was probably one of my favourite experiences in wow outside of Vanilla itself
---
Those aren't MMORPGs.
---
vAnIlLa HaS fInItE cOnTeNt LOL
---
*Ignoring the fact that it's been thriving on private servers for ~13 years now.*
---
If y’all come across a Dwarf Priest named Rarecandy. Shoot me a wave and I’ll shoot you a Fort.
---
Your conclusion seems flawed. Perhaps the lesson is that people are too experimental? Or that they do not know what is good for them? To say that something as deleterious as flying mounts wasn't a mistake does not compute.
---
&gt; It'll probably be 1.5 - 2 years before we even have to think about what happens after naxx, i figure blizzard will release the phases every 2-4 months (just a guess). 
---
Classic itself has been under work for some time already. Remember it was revealed in Blizzcon 2017 and it's not like they hadn't been working on it already by then.
---
If they want to get something out at a reasonable timeframe after Naxx then it's pretty much now that they have to start to worry about it.
---
Damn this is so thorough! Thanks man, your contribution to the community is well appreciated.
---
no u
---
Wow yeah seems it! Thanks for the info! I always wondered
---
Your raiding style and times are nearly perfect for me. I only wish you were aiming for Horde, as I really want to play UD lock. Still having a slight lean towards dwarf priest just to know i can get a raiding slot; if I choose that route I will definitely give you an app.
---
Yep! Wowhead is getting their Classic page set up and there's plenty of good guides up there already.
---
Except they said that Azeroth being a Titan Soul is one of a kind, there is no AU Azeroth.
---
I’m driving cross country that week so if it’s gonna be any day do June 9th. I have summer courses, but it’s still a month of nothing, but class and classic. Releasing anytime sooner or anytime after July 17th will blow. Which means July 24th release date.
---
They are different kinds of difficult. The fight mechanics in vanilla are nothing compared to retail. No one can debate this. 
---
Vanilla is difficult for different reasons. Some things that made it difficult include:
---
1) organizing and maintaining a core group of 40-55 raiders
---
2) Loot scarcity. Lots of raiders, not a lot of loot to go around. 
---
3) Time investment. Cash for pots, flasks, other mats, etc.
---
The retail game is too big, you're right.
---
Classic will be well worth the wait for you.
---
Yes, louder!
---
Looking back on the first few years and comparing it to when I did actually raid like a side job (was fun at the time for server progression races) it basically was all like pug raids.  I think it will be easier to drop into groups this time around, and there are definitely guilds/groups that play one night a week or semi randomly etc.
---
If you were able to grind to ap 50 before Crucible came out. Mechanically not that hard, just time consuming to be prepared for it.
---
Yep and since it’s an RP server, hopefully blizzard will ban the toxic trolls
---
Twin blades in vanilla? That's crazy, where?
---
I like how your mind works 😈
---
I haven't heard many requests for anything but TBC/Wrath. I doubt many people are clamoring for Cata or WoD servers lol.
---
Personally I would much rather play TBC or Wrath than Vanilla. I love Vanilla content, but the snails pace of the game is just a little offputting to me. That said, Vanilla is *miles* ahead of retail at the moment, so I will happily play it until TBC/Wrath happen (hopefully).
---
TL;DR: Separate servers that have resets/wipes.  
---
Separate servers that have a reset cycle would be really cool and keep the phases fresh. Similar to how diablo has seasons but over a years length of time. 
---
I would be okay with blizzard allowing at least one character made on the server to have a transfer queue. Similar to when logging on after a server merge and have a name change queued on a character. 
---
For example: I would log on. A notices comes up saying I need to choose a character to transfer due to a reset. When I go to the server that has been reset I would get to choose one character to transfer. Then a list of servers would pop up after after choosing which server I want. Then all stats and item on that character would transfer to that new server. While all the other characters are deleted. FOREVER! 
---
Or just have the server reset with no transfer.
---
All in all there should be a notice that would tell players before making a character on a reset server noting what it is. Similar to how seasonal characters on diablo have a notice before creation.
---
you forgot
---

---
Does blizzard sell all of your personal information to 3rd party sites and their affiliates and their subsidiaries?
---
Exactly. Its like being a tourist. 
---
watch, observe and engage if you want to, just don’t shit on for the sake of the locals. 
---
The good part about it is that there is more “community-made content” like here on Emerald Dream we have big organized WPVP fights, merchant’s day and you’ll always find people just doing their own RP business so if you ever feel burnt out of grinding quests then you can always find people doing cool/weird stuff and watch it or even participate if you like. 
---
My biggest cringe was using /e to RP, like I’m fine with playing a long but using /e to descriptively describe what i’m specifically doing for others/myself to imagine isn’t really my favourite.
---
Yes!  No more just flying over content that devs spent hundreds of hours designing!  Explore the world, not pass it by :D
---
I don’t see an issue with them building off classic as a base, maintaining it as it is, but also incorporating progressions seasons on the side.  Much like Diablo 2/3’s seasons and resets, every 3-4 months they could launched a cycle of Vanilla, TBC, Wrath etc. raid progression, locking each tier of content / expansion behind progression and completion of the previous one.

SL warlock because despite it being a scaling spec it's also retardedly overpowered so :shrug:
---
It's a pservers thing, which is a 1.12 thing, which is a Classic thing.
---
I think it's simple: station Ethereals near every point you'd have to fly up to manning teleportation pads. Or localized flight path up to the plateau. Mark the locations on the map so it's easy to find the way(s) up. No real modification necessary, just a few additions.
---
One could also even make an argument that Blizzard could need or want certain things to help the program. A simple QR reader shouldn't need as much as it's asking
---
No I definitely remember "Artifacts" being Red, prior to even TBC being announced, long before Heirlooms were even a concept (WotLK). I remember drooling over the Twin Blades of Azzinoth that only existed in the database by that time.
---
It was changed to Pale Gold some time in BC, and then in Wrath of the Lich King, Heirlooms were introduced and **~were~** counted as Artifact-quality items, hence the error message you used to get when trying to mail them to a character that was not yours. "Artifacts can only be mailed to your own characters". They were only changed to the blue color and their own "Battle.net Account Bound" item quality in Legion to make way for the Legion Artifact weapons.

Proof of the Red text predating the Pale Gold text from WoWWiki: 
---
&gt; According to an older version of the [Item Basics page](https://web.archive.org/web/20070616040221/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/basics.html) (until around July 2007) on the WoW website, the names of Artifact-quality items were planned to appear in red. A listing for Artifacts no longer appears on this page however. The red-linked version still exists in archive form under the dates Jul 15, 2005 through Jun 15, 2007.

What made you quit and not give BC a try?
---
I remember doing this a lot in BC with that crazy sky. Full on astronomy type vibes. Nice pics.
---
But uhm.. what happens after Naxx?
---
Fuck no. Especially not PVE. Let's be real honest here, 80% of the people on RP realms are lonely older folk just trying to get off or find some meaningful human interaction that they cant find in rl.
---
He got rank 14 after this. I miss remembered 😝
---
That may be due to inaccurate stat conversions on those servers. Like str = more AP than it should. I guess we will know when classic comes out what the values really were
---
I’ve always wanted old Hyjal and Emerald Dream content
---
I appreciate the response! I have always been into wow lore I have just never taken the jump into the game. Sometimes I feel like i missed out already lol
---
Or a orc warrior going into that green cave for the first time.
---
Hunter T1 and T2 8/8 are bis and t3 6/9 is bis with the other 3 pieces still being very good
---
Shaman T1 bonuses are good enough to still be used in naxx. Not necessarily bis, but all 3 bonuses have uses
---
Druids T1 kind of sucks, but you keep 3 piece around for buffing thorns. T2 has some really nice bonuses for healers and is mostly some really nice healer gear. Same for T3, the 2 piece bonus is particularly nice.
---
And I think all classes have at least some t3 in their bis lists for at least 1 spec
---
TBC is not retail, bud. Slippery slope is a fallacy, not an argument.
---
Just because one single aspect of old wow still exists in retail doesn't make it acceptable to dismiss the preferences of millions of people with "go retail 4Head."
---
They'll split the classic servers. You'll get to keep your level 60 forever and others will get to copy theirs over to a TBC realm and progress to 70.
---
TBC gear comes to memory, what a time to be alive... We all looked like neon ragdolls
---
This is one of those things that, quite a bit down the road when all content is consumed, I would like for us all to discuss with the devs about testing and possibly implementing. Along with Azshara Crater, Emerald Dream and all its unfinished storylines, etc.
---
Combined with the beautiful music of the zone, it's magical.
---
All cloth and leather is druid gear
---
I pretty much only care about raiding. I'm probably gonna have an alt I PvP with.
---
I want to be valued in a raid (ie easier to get into one) so that's my hesitation towards Druid, as I hear while you bring 2-3 no one really cares.
---
Shamans are valued,  but I'm a bit concerned about totem management being frustrating
---
Paladin seems fun and valuable,  and simple. Just spam flash of light. But there leveling is what keeps me from it.
---
True, whatever the reason may be Blizzard should address it especially now that they're asking everyone to use the app.  
---
Why couldn't the ticket simply be on the already made  Blizzard [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) App?
---
Seems like Blizzard is getting one bad news after the next. I hate to see Blizzard getting so much bad press when they have great employees in both development and support staff.  
---
Hopefully some of that will clear up when I finally join WoW for the first time ever when classic comes out.
---
Yeah you can. Some pieces are good but the thing is they have no int. You need int even as feral.or you'll just get fucked man.
---
No it wasn't.  Antorus the Burning Throne was (i ahve aotc on it, got taesch and scythe of the unmaker skins also :P)
---
Mekkatorque is from the second raid in BfA.
---
Yep.  I play a Mage.  When I’m questing in War Mode, and run across same faction players, I always give them arcane intellect.  Many time a few other faction players will roll up and the world PVP begins.  I’m glad we buffed each other.
---
Yeah it was cool and ty for the thanks!
---
This
---
Also you won't be specced into imp sprint if you're pvping as you'll lose CB + a couple points in lethality
---
Spider belt is also nice to have but its on a chunky 30 min cd
---
The first time I rolled into Winterspring on my paladin to farm Icebloom for alchemy, and it was super foggy and a snowstorm at night. [Queue Night Mountain] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMEJhiunQt0)
---
*Chills*
---
I'm thinking about it, but I've only played Horde so I feel like it would be weird to have to kill Orcs and Trolls in BGs lol
---
I believe it would be the latter, but I am not 100% on that. I can look into it further.
---
The stat conversions are well known since vanilla.
---
gotta save that mana while baiting them into returning a buff amirite
---
I think it would be cool if they at some point did release a TBC server that you could voluntarily move your character from vanilla to. Don't close the vanilla server or anything, but allow people to continue progressing. TBC and retail are no where even close to the same games so it's not like saying just play retail.
---
Healers....
---
Paladin being the most obvious yea
---
Server balance seems to be overlooked when people have these arguments. Instant queue versus 30+ minutes between battlegrounds is huge. Even more so when in a premade group that’s wins every game quickly as well as getting instant queues. I didn’t have a hard time getting a rather high rank even when raiding almost every night for 4-6 hrs. Can’t remember the number but Knight lieutenant sounds familiar.
---
You can also get more than one r14 a week if done right.
---
Same, intellect buff gang is still a thing
---
Ok the getting off part is cringey but the part about meaningful human interaction? What's wrong with that? You say that like it's a bad thing. Isn't that what online gaming is for? That's how it started out. It started out being more about the social aspect of it than the actual leveling and raiding.
---
Why was the AV post unpinned?
---
Like some pieces listed are just straight worse then other availble gear. Easy example is the hunter stage 6 weapons, has Silithid Claw listed when Hatchet of Sundered Bone is 6ap better
---
The novelty wore off pretty quickly for me. After that I was just mad about how it ruined world PvP.
---
Just TP a painfully shy person, or a mute. Emote a couple of hand gestures and they will leave you alone soon enough.
---
At some point you'll downrank regrowth to get crits to procc the .5 sec reduction for healing touch
---
No, demand for re-visiting old expansions dies off hard post-WotLK. I highly doubt there will be nearly enough interest to continue the cycle after Wrath.
---
Even if they do, I think it's a certainty that they'll give anyone that wants it the option of keeping their 60 character on a 60 only realm. TBC Classic and Wrath Classic will just be copying your character over to a new realm. It's not going to be a forced upgrade like retail, they remember what happened in the last 15 years.
---
Pretty sure stagnation happens.
---
methinks you lied
---
To a lesser extent, because of the greater investment and PvE focus of raiding at 60.
---
x = if you can dodge a wrench...
---
I would not advise raiding as feral dps as a casual player... You can do it but it has the hardest rotation out of any spec and your consume farming is the most out of anyone as well.
---
Awesome, I'll check these creators out. I recognize a few of the names from the Deftalks I've listened to.
---
That doesn’t make sense based on the comment I replied to though. He’s stating that in vanilla agility was favored and that has since changed on private servers where strength is favored. If the stat conversions were well known all along why the shift?
---
For over but not pvp
---
Exactly. I want to be able to play at my own pace, and take breaks from the game, and come back months/years later and pick up where I left off, and not have to worry about the game changing into something else. Classic should be preserved indefinitely as the vanilla version of the game. If they do TBC, it can be a separate thing. Leave classic alone forever.
---
that chastity belt tho.
---
Haha thanks! I'll check these out.
---
After naxx comes BC. This isn't going to be like a private server, eternally Frozen at the vanilla endgame.
---
Human interaction isnt bad. I just prefer mine (in wow) to involve some form of game related progression. I can hold hands and sing around a tree with friend irl. And I wont be harrassed by hundreds of dudes pretending to be women and offering sexual services.
---
Unfortunately, these surveys aren't sound data. They never reflect reality. It polls a subset of the playerbase that is most likely to represent statistical anomalies: people who browse /r/classicwow and watch Classic videos long before we even have a release date. We're much more likely to follow certain patterns that others wouldn't. The other 99% aren't basing their choice on the same inputs, and many won't even have played vanilla before and may pick the class they play in BFA or whatever.
---
I remember when N*st launched and there was a class poll whose results indicated things like warlock being the second most played class, and then when you looked at the data from an actual in-game census it turned out to be one of the least played. It's kinda like going to an indie film festival to ask people their favorite director and then later polling random people at Walmart on the same question. There would be huge shifts in results.
---
The gaming community is notoriously unpollable because the amount of meme answers is too high. With 10k takers, the poll is likely skewed by random things like if Esfand showed the poll on stream and a thousand of his viewers went and voted human paladin for the lulz. So don't assume gnome warrior will be underplayed based on a few thousand votes on some random website.

Druid T2 is a standout for good armor sets, same for the paladins.
---
After naxx we hope it becomes something like OSRS.
---
Not OP, but I did GM work for another video game company and we had this massive issue of people glitching in shooters. Back then (early 2000s) there were whole glitcher guilds and we infiltrated one - we had to submit proof that we hacked, so we sent glitchy screenshots and pics of our hands dual wielding controllers (there was a glitch you could do by bugging up controller input by connecting and swapping them). We sat in that guild for months reading chat every now and then to figure out how to repro bugs, which we then passed off to QA and devs for fixing. It was funny to hear (and join in, for authenticity) when they ranted about bugs being fixed and exploits patched.
---
So, not WoW, but another triple A company definitely did have a secret snoop squad.
---
Exactly! I don't stop playing all my  Gamecube, Wii and PS2 games, even though I've beaten Wind Waker countless times and know everything about it. I don't see why some people are worried that Classic will suddenly end once the Scourge Invasion and Naxxramas is released. There's literally so much to do in Classic and there's so many little things I don't remember very well or never got a chance to experience. Even if say I get my final piece of Tier 3 gear on my hunter, I'll just make more characters.
---
He even name changed and people still new because he couldn't change his character model.
---
Becomes more expensive server wise. There would have to be enough players on both to justify it.
---
Lol, yeah some RP realms have way too much ERP. It's kind of nasty.
---
I worry that will cause the player base to split and hurt us in the long run? 
---
Although if people stop playing Classic because they are bored then I guess it's a moot point...
---
I think the red was (originally?) only planned; I recall them showing up as gold when linked in game or in the files.
---
to be fair the changes to the gameplay and classes pretty well negate most of that, getting to 120 is a cake walk because retail is ALL about the the end game. Even as someone new to the game you should be able to hit 120 in less than 4-5 days played. If you have heirloom gear you can go from 1-80 in a day without any real challenge.
---
I didn’t think that flying was bad in BC. It took effort to get, especially the epic flying mounts, it made the new zones more interesting, and there was still original zone content that you couldn’t fly to. I think flying became to much  in WOTLK, and then was just overboard in Cata.
---
i smell caverns of time ports!
---
This is how I've experienced it, people were always respectful, as long as I wasn't acting like a complete idiot.  I just preferred to experience the RP than do it myself.  Though I never played on RP servers for a long time.
---
We get geared and live forever happy in classic wow land.
---
Increased server expense. There would have to be enough players on both content realms to justify it. Furthermore you split your playerbase even further. You can only split it so much.
---
I was so disappointed when Grim Batol turned out to just be a dungeon in Cataclysm. It had so much lore and importance and yet that was the best they could come up with?
---
As a Priest main, throwing PW:F at anything that moves is truly one of the great joys in life. &lt;3
---
Welp, there it is. You dropped some real knowledge dog. Looks like I'll be rolling alliance as crazy as it sounds.
---
They turned up as Pale Gold during BC.
---
Best way to answer this is to play the game on release. Then you’ll know if it’s right for you or not.
---
Lmao. Nope. Level as SHADOW but with wand spec and spirit tap the first 10 talents.
---
At 40 you respec to shadow form, dropping wand spec, but getting all 5 back at lvl 45.
---
Dude, I've leveled multiple priests. All +spirit gear, bis wand.
---
Never buy any water or drink unless healing a dungeon. Destroy a mob, another, another all with zero down time or rest. Your mama goes back fast after you sw:P and wand the mob, occasional MB in rotation. It's nuts. I've gone hours without resting on a constant grind. 
---
Leveling is the easiest and fastest of all classes in game if speccd and geared right.
---
At raid time you respec for holy or discipline, or if you guild allows it, shadow but without wand and spirit tap.
---
Trust me on this.
---
If there’s no official RPPVP server, the RPPvP community is choosing a PVP server to be designated the unofficial RPPvP server.
---
2 and an extra just in case
---
Yes, yes it is. Eternal or shutdown.
---
Why kill Classic with the same meme expansion that killed Vanilla?
---
Gamers make terrible game designers.
---
That is, as I understand it, the entire point of re-releasing Vanilla WoW.
---
Fact is, you can't play any of the old versions of the game the same way you can play an old SNES game, or read an old book. But the point of this re-release, as I understand it, is to change that. The whole Classic WoW project is about putting the old game out there for people to play (hence the need for absolute authenticity) permanently.
---
It defeats the point to add to or change anything. Then it's not Vanilla WoW anymore. Then we're back to not being able to just boot up the old game the same way we can boot up our old N64 games. Then we're back to people asking for a Classic version of Classic WoW. A version of Classic WoW without all the changes and additions. A Classic Classic WoW, if you will. It's stupid.
---
Could just as easily be resets every 3 years with existing characters being relegated to a legacy server.
---
Genuinely feel bad that this guy is so ignorant.

You can't buy Felstriker on the AH. Stop acting like a window licking autist.
---
Oh, any also how many for four horsemen. I heard 8 for them as well.
---
Unrealistic polls. Everyone likes the idea of being a warrior, but even on pservers they're always in need. People give up leveling them. 
---
I think the same sort of thing happens with locks, although it has more to do with skill level. They get ganked a few times by a rogue in stv and give up because it's too difficult to manage a pet, dots, fear, etc. You can just frost nova and blink away as a mage.
---
If they keep classic before BC they can correct this mistake, as not going further in the expansions but re-creating the game further on.
---
I feel bad for ERPers but okay
---
When I was a kid I was anti-cybering, but now I think i'm onboard. Granted it's not my cup of [tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8) or anything.
---
Some are just pretending. However, many also have the misconception that almost nobody ever got R14. Plenty did, but the PvP community was nowhere near as open as it became when arenas were introduced, so you just didn't really hear about R14s unless you personally knew one. There's two new R14s every week starting ~3 months after the honor system comes online. After a year, that's hundreds per realm. Thousands upon thousands hit R14 in vanilla and will again in Classic. If anything, the vanilla PvP culture has evolved over the years to make it way easier than it was originally by agreeing to unofficial honor caps that cut down the hours needed to get top standing.
---
I just need to click on Rolf's body! Where do they all keep spawning from?!

Technically can be done with 4 , 8 tanks is more like the safest / meme strategy
---
F R E S H M E M E S
---
You forgot that blizzard is a business and likes money. If classic starts to fade they will inevitably release more content. What that content is exactly, we won't know until that time comes.
---
&gt; You know where else you saw that sentiment a lot? Playing vanilla.
---
Yeah, I'm sure people back then thought a few 'harmless' little changes here or there wouldn't devolve the game into what it is today either.
---
I should have told them to fuck off back then as well :)
---
Learn from past mistakes please. 
---
Also, how is 'wish they do' not a form of advocating for that? His post is basically stealthily trying to do exactly that. I expect this would be one of the most realistic potential changes after phase 6 (if they decide to go OSRS route).
---
You evil genius you...
---
I honestly don't see them having a refreshing vanilla server or a Frozen in Time Legacy server. There classic will move on to burning Crusade, and perhaps when that happens they will start a new classic realm at the beginning. Or maybe they will do it every other expansion and wait until they are up to wrath before opening a new classic server.
---
I can't see them basing their strategy on a system that caters to the small percentage of people in the private server Community who hop from fresh server to Fresh server until their hands fall off.
---
I've always played a frost mage, both in retail and vanilla. I love turtling in AV and the ability to do lower tier raids/dungeons and PvP in the same spec (Frost). For classic, though, I'm considering playing warrior as I'll be playing with a priest. I enjoy the challenge of leveling, but I'm concerned that at max level I will be terrible in PvP without gear and that the specs for PvP and PvE will be to different to do both.
---
1. Is it possible to have fun as a warrior without 100% amazing gear? (Keep in mind, I'll have a priest).
---
2. Is it possible to PvP and PvE reasonably well in the same spec, or is respecing fairly necessary?
---
&gt; the community turned the game into a hot pile of garbage, intentionally and willingly.
---
Yeah, the community wanted 6.1 to be a Twitter integration and cosmetics patch. And the community wanted expansions of ability pruning. And the community wanted Azerite traits. And the community wanted...
---
Come on now, I know we like to pretend that everything was downhill after Classic but it's not hard to look up the subscription numbers. Back in the day, burning Crusade increased in subscriptions and then wrath increased on top of that.
---
Plus, I have to sin the very concept of killing classic because it sounds like, oh my this new game is the wow killer. They're not going to cater to the private server infinite replay community.
---
I can also contact you here!
---
I have a few questions that you didn't appear to provide:
---
1. What are the three days slated to be?
---
2. When you say "primarily PvE", does that imply that you'll still have a PvP contingent within the guild? Or does it mean "actually mostly only PvE"?
---
3. What is the loot system for raids?
---
Why do people like you even care to post?
---
Except TBC is not a slippery slope, its already at the bottom of the hill.
---
Agreed. TBC was my best time in WoW to be honest. I love Classic, don't get me wrong, but so many memories I want to recreate in TBC.
---
TBC and retail have so much in common it's not even funny.
---
&gt; Any player slain by Azuregos gets the "Mark of Frost". Azuregos periodically sends out an AOE pulse that freezes anyone with this mark into an ice cube. The mark cannot be removed in most cases; players with this are essentally out of the fight for 15 minutes.
---
Nothing you do before level 120 means anything, literally only the latest content release is relevant in BfA, and the time it takes to reach 120 is a fraction of the time it will take you to reach 60 in classic.   
---
Classes also lack depth in BfA (the majority of the complaints about BfA initially were about class design), learning to play in "the same league" as veterans (the skill level varies immensely and the average player is ridiculously far behind the top player) will take about as much effort as it takes to learn the moveset of a character in a tekken game.  
---
    
---
You're gonna choose for yourself at any rate, but I want to weigh in and tell you that the difference between the two games is massive, as the current iteration of wow is a treadmill, a game so full of systems designed to keep you subscribed, like a drug addict.   
---
Classic will be a different game entirely, especially for someone who didn't get to experience it the first time around, as the game is centered around its social aspects which makes it governed by the players themselves, instead of enslaving them to play perpetual catch-up in an infinite loop.  
---
On live you'll mostly run into players that are resentful because they're basically drug addicts that can't let the game go, either due to the sunk cost fallacy or because they've been tricked into the neverending azerite and item level grind.   
---
On classic you'll also run into resentful players, but far less than in BfA, because classic is not a treadmill or full of systems to keep you subbed, you can come and go as you please.  
---
Personally I would recommend that you try out BfA with a critically thinking mindset, so that you can see and experience what it has to offer and decide for yourself whether the treadmill is something for you. Just keep in mind that the active wow playerbase hasn't been this small since before the release of the burning crusade for a reason.
---
My guess is OP is asking if retail is worth getting into before classic. Retail has it's fun, but it is a different fun than what classic offers. (A lot of people in this sub will demonize retail, it certainly has plenty of flaws, but it is still enjoyable for new players)
---
I never really encourage it, but a pserver is not a bad option while waiting for classic play around with your friends find a class that you enjoy try new things. I would not push hard to get 60 on a pserver though.
---
After i get full  bis on my character i will just... slay some alliance till they call their friends.
---
Yeah, we're in a weird spot now. Ive been leveling up different races/classes (just to 15ish) on pservers to help decide what I want to play. 
---
Might try and twink out at 19 and just fuck around for a while
---
What kind of elitism do you mean on pve servers?
---
Maybe? If you wanna know now maybe try it out on a you-know-what-server.
---
Or wait till Classic comes out and spend 15 dollars on it for a month.
---
It's interesting looking through all the bluetracker posts.
---
Basically if there's a thread with a shitload of comments you can look across and almost guarantee it's regarding to classic.
---
The number of posts dwarf (haha) the posts of the standard, retail game.
---
Hype: CONFIRMED
---
Anxiety 101, the game didn't even launched and they are already worrying about what will happens years after.
---
That's why I said "extra lazy" lol. As soon as a group in retail sees a lock in the group, they expect to be summoned straight to the boss instead of outside the instance, even though it only saves them a minute at best.
---
Technically can be done with 6*. It would be straight up impossible with 4, you'd be dragging around two of them by the safe zone and killing whoever has stacks.
---
I really don't think they've thought that far ahead. To be completely honest, I get the vibe from Ion at least that they think classic will kind of peter out for a lot of people before they ever have to answer this question. I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying they underestimate the number of people who will actually stay with Classic. I think a lot of the big shots (not the Classic team) feel like it's more of a "distract them until the next retail expansion" thing that people will leave in droves when they realize how much harder classic was. 
---
Realistically, however, IF the game succeeds and enough players stay with the game they will HAVE to add new content of some kind or it will eventually die. For all but the most hardcore of fans, you're eventually gonna get to the point where you've cleared everything there is multiple times with multiple classes and it's just not interesting anymore. Personally, I hope they come up with new content just for Classic while keeping the classes and other systems the same as Vanilla rather than just progressing through all the same expansions 15 years behind retail.
---
They can do both. Also it’s not like if Classic is a success they won’t do TBC as well.
---
.
---
We got Naxxramas, yes.
---
But what about SECOND Naxxramas?
---
Downvotes received from people who never played vanilla and started in TBC confirmed.
---
Bored at work
---
The reason I asked because our guild is considering using main and off spec dps to make sure that our players have the gear when we reach naxx. Were allowing some flexability in our raids and will allow 2 enchancement shaman (if they want to be) and dps warriors. I was afraid of players not not wanting to use there dkp to purchase the off set gear they will eventually need and wanted to have off set dkp for those players. Were still considering if off set dkp will be for all classes or only thoses who truly have a off spec. I was trying to figure out how many tanks we will need at one point.
---
No one is asking anymore, stop stretching memes lol
---
I would rather they expose certain statistics with an API so add-ons can query for that information. I don't want full blown achievements, I just want to know how many quests I've done, how many kills I've had over the years, how much gold I accrued, etc.
---
Found one of my own
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/NHgfRS4
---
Because we have the time available to do so?
---
I'm just looking forward to the whole journey again. Leveling professions, making Gold, just starting over. I feel like profesions in retail wow suck now. Miss feeling like each level gained mattered.
---
Not an English teacher I hope.
---
Its because there was very little actual theorycrafting in Vanilla days. Everyone saw HotW buffing strength and 1 str = 2 ap and assumed strength was king. When in actual fact, 1 agi providing 1 ap and % crit is still a higher DPS increase, not to mention the dodge it provides also.
---
I raided feral (mostly offtank) back in Vanilla up and into AQ40 and you will always be hated by rogues for taking their gear unless you deal similar damage to them. Expect to be in atleast half of those pre-raid BiS blues for well into Phase 5.
---
Well - the current game has an actual overarching story behind it.  BFA focuses on the conflict between the horde and the alliance following the defeat of the burning legion.  It makes no fucking sense for the most part and BFA is just a trash game imo.  
---
Classic on the other hand takes place inbetween the second and third wars (I believe...) and has a really disjointed story.  You kind of get a thousand small stories throughout the world.  There is a story for each raid encounter etc. but it's not the lifeblood of the game as a whole.  I would highly recommend checking out classic when it launches but it's definitely an entirely different experience from retail so you may like one and hate the other / vice versa etc.
---
That's what humans invented printers for.
---
Yea those grell laughs are hard coded in my brain like the human 'huh' sounds. Gamer ptsd if you will...
---
Make it tbc with level 70 raids, but keep the level cap 60 and scale all gear so it doesn't instantly overpower naxx gear, also no flying. Would make even traveling hard.
---
Edinburgh will be having Fringefest/the Edinburgh Festival in late summer.
---
Omg fml this.
---
They weren't obtainable, they just exist in the database.
---
I think the idea though is that the "feral" gear has a good amount of both str and agi while shadowcraft is more agi heavy.
---
Depending on how much str is on that gear it could easily be better for feral just based on the overall total stat distribution.
---
He's saying agility is regarded as better than strength for feral in the recent years. At least that's what I think he means and it changed because more theory crafting I assume. Also there's a stat weight I'm sure where agility becomes better the more gear you have.
---
Yuuuuup
---
We do know. They already confirmed at least 15 years of fresh servers.
---
Sometimes when you spell out the truth people have a hard time accepting it.
---
I wouldn't advise leveling any gear crafting profession pre 60 as it will just involve more time invested and no practical rewards.
---
Nah man. Hunters just don’t scale as good as other classes. Their dps is low(compared to warrior rogue mage lock)
---
I agree, except that if you're healing the dungeon just go ahead and ask the rogue if its ok. Most likely they won't care seeing as Shadowcraft isn't great for Rogues for the most part. There are much better pre-bis options for the most part.
---
It wasn't. The only person I've seen that claims to have gotten it was lying.
---
They were claiming that because they had the icon next the number of HKs on their profile on Blizzard's character page, it meant they had gotten it in Vanilla. Nevermind the fact that the icon only scaled from the total number of HKs the character had, as hero classes and twinks had the icon as well despite obviously not getting it during vanilla.
---
Yeah I thought what I said was pretty clear as well lol.
---
Or when you enter the portal your character get copied. That way you can choose to play either.
---
Still doesn’t make sense. If we had the numbers all along why would strength be regarded better now? Everyone was lacking basic math a decade ago or what? Lol
---
I always buffed everyone with Underwater breathing on my Warlock. Shame not every class can buff at least something...
---
tldr; get this talent asap every time :)
---
There was tons of theorycrafting in vanilla days. There were tons of fan sites dedicated to it specifically..
---
My biggest regret is playing on an RP server when I wasn't into RP (rolled there cos my boarding school friend played on it). I played on Earthen Ring EU during classic and the average progress was staggeringly low. It'll probably be different come classic, but the hunger on PvE and PvP servers was just different - people actually did dungeons and actively tried to beat the endgame content while on ER they just sat around roleplaying.  
---
I remember ragequitting my raid force (raid forces were a leftover from EQ I believe?), a group of people that raided together while being part of different guilds, because I whispered asking one of the other resto shamans (I was one myself) why he was healing while using Deathbringer, a dps axe, in his mainhand while we were struggling in ZG. He called me out on ventrilo and the entire group gave me shit about it saying that the guy had earned the weapon and he could use it if he wanted. It was an innocent question and I took so much flak over nothing, so to me, the RP community was the first toxic community I left behind.   
---
But your experience may vary.  
---
PS, if you're reading this, yes I still remember, and I still hold a grudge Cajuungumbo. Fuck you :p
---
If you're running the dungeon as a feral then yes no doubt.
---
If you're healing the dungeon, the consensus would be that a rogue or hunter would get prio over you if they need it. 
---
I would be surprised if they actually need Shadowcraft, but it's always good to COMMUNICATE with your party beforehand in order to avoid any problems.
---
It wouldn't be "City Protector" though, it would be "Chieftain of Thunder Bluff" or "Deathlord of the Undercity". Sounds much better than HWL to me but that's just my opinion.
---
Why would they use leather for end game content? Or did he just mean while leveling?
---
Agi is good for tanking, though.
---
How were hunters in classic? I know the jist of it, but was it fun/hard?
---
Originally wanted to roll pally. But my god. Fuck lvling as a pally on pservers. Decided to make a Hunter, my least played class in all 13 years of wow. And its a blast so far. I know they don't scale for shit. But did you ever give a shit? Did you ever feel like a shit class and better off rolling something else? 
---
Most important, how did you feel in pvp? Both world and bgs.
---
Is that the actual release date? I read on this subreddit that the release date would drop today possibly and have been frantically searching everywhere for an answer and so far this is the only thing I’ve seen today of a release date.
---
I second MadSeason. His voice is very low and monotonous, but his videos are great - very rich with little known info.
---
That's kind of the wrong way to look at it though. They introduced a water walking rep mount in MoP. Most people have it now so the majority of mounts you see around before flying is unlocked are those bugs. With the mount equipment at least you can use a different mount.
---
If you're healing, you can ask for second dibs. The Rogue may already have or it may not be an upgrade.
---
I'm aware of the claim... It is specifically why I made the post. Lol.
---
Most people won’t even get past naxx lol
---
I think that this has been theorycrafted to death.
---
The hunter just doesn't scale as well with gear progression.
---
With that said, A good and reliable player is always more valuable than a bad one regardless of class, so these analytics should not deter anyone from playing what they enjoy, as good players will always be hard to come by.
---
This is just abstracting things too far. What's the point of doing anything except farm gold from greys all day and buying BOEs from AH if we abstract all items to their AH value? Well the diff is the group teamwork to clearing a dungeon and the reward of that effort, killing bosses or getting a lucky drop from trash mobs are what make dungeons more enjoyable than just farming gold solo in the world. If it's a BOE upgrade and the person will equip it then they should roll need. Everyone else rolls greed. Reputation means more in classic too. If I am leveling and see a great BOE upgrade I would be pissed if a rogue ninjad my priest upgrade so he could sell it. I don't have time or money to farm for that specific item per se but would be really excited about the random drop and good fortune to actually USE the item.
---
I cant tell if this is a pserver bug or if I'm going to be stuck with this on live classic. When you spam the button for arcane explosion as a mage, you cast the first one, and then nothing happens unless you stop spamming it for about half a second. This obviously drastically reduces the effectiveness of the spell since it artificially increases the GCD for it. Anyone know for sure?
---
Yeah, over the past 15 year no one has been able to figure out how properly play hunter...
---
Seems like the relative success of private servers proves that there is a market for it, and with older expansions Blizzard does not have to pit the same stress on constantly updating the game to fix nee content bugs.
---
Dude people have been playing vanilla for 10+ years maxing out every class etc etc min max everything and its clear hunters dps is not great
---
Like there is no aspect that have not been explored hunter dps is awful compared to alot of other classes deal with it.
---
It's not regarded as better necessarily...
---
Yea but it’s not like it’s purely anecdotal.. there math, parses, theorycrafting..
---
I’m fighting the urge to take a red pen and correct the fuck outta this comment.
---
For a few solid years if I ever saw A shaman named Goldust(I think... maybe Golduzt ), I had to drop everything I was doing and attack him. Didn’t matter if I was about to take a flag, kill a mob, or whatever. just kill goldust. It became even more rare as time went on that we would encounter each other. But it was the same thing in later expansions (maybe with a /salute rather than a /spit). Respectable mutual hatred.
---
I also remember 3 of my friends(all 60) trying to run a random lowbie through deadmines trying to pull everything to VC and aoe it down lol. 
---
I like to think it was his first dungeon and he was impressed.
---
And then you have the people who had an orgasm while watching the unbreakable video, rolled a shaman and proceeded to run around trying to win the windfury lottery.  
---
We'll have plenty of those again come classic :p
---
Lmao
---
Hunters were strong until about halfway into BWL, and it wasn't skill causing them not to keep up. The bleeding edge raiders on down all dropped off, if it was just skill there would be a ton of raid parses proving they could be just as strong. There isn't though.
---
You were not wrong this was fucking awful
---
&gt; and in the next patch of BFA, they are adding water-walking for ALL mounts,
---
Wow. I didn't actually believe you when I read this. Just looked it up. Just depressing. I haven't played BfA (first expansion I haven't played at all), and this pretty much guarantees I won't give it a try. It's not that I'm upset my water strider is basically useless, it's that the make *all* mounts walk on water with "inflatable shoes" or whatever they are.
---
It's as if Blizzard is trying to kill off the retail game by adding the dumbest features. It just amazes me that people are ok with many of these changes.
---
I'm gonna disagree with most and say try a pserver . I had forgotten so much about the game and classes and found it interesting playing again.
---
Forgot too how much harder and slow the leveling was. I know I have already changed my mind what class I'll be playing based on retrying things.
---
Inb4 alternate timeline
---
and after that? :P
---
He's confusing me at this point.
---
Hahaha
---
I completely understand where you’re coming from and agree with you. 
---
Theres always downsides to RP realms. But from my experience, groups would never RP in raids or dungeons or bgs, moreso out in the world. It was like an unspoken rule. 
---
There were times where i would be running Utgarde Keep in WotLK and my group would stop to RP and I’d have to log cuz I’d get frustrated of waiting the hour. So I do know what you mean.
---
yet another thing Blizz doesn't understand about retail WoW, and why warforge/titanforge is a mistake.
---
Blizz *thinks* not being able to get perfect gear means people will keep playing, but instead they just get burned out and quit altogether.
---
Probably more old gods. Or the Light expansion.
---
This post did not age well.
---
TBH I've had the idea in my head, though not really taking it seriously. But your post just made me start to seriously consider it. I like PvP realms for the realism/immersion of being free to engage enemy players if you like, but I don't enjoy ganking or toxicity at all. An RP-PvP realm might be a more pleasant experience....now if only Blizzard would commit to making them.
---
Nah release forgotten azeroth lore.
---
Yes you will.
---
Is there a buff that hunters can give that is typically well received?
---
I disagree.
---
What if that happens to you in vanilla :o?
---
Can't really say anything is forgotten until after the last expansions released
---
It is literally impossible to do it with 4.
---
That doesn't make any sense. BC will be here long before Nax will.
---
I figure yes since the subs between the two will be shared
---
What I meant was that the population that actually engaged in endgame activities was frighteningly low, despite it being a medium pop server, not that they paused dungeons for impromptu RP sessions :p
---
I don't think there is as much reliable data as most think. Its mostly a overwhelming anecdotes that appear as facts because they are so widespread.
---
good choice. same gameplay, less rules.
---
Stats matter more than armor for dps. Agility gives crit —&gt; fury wants crit —&gt; leather armor usually offers more crit than plate/mail. Same reason holy pallys and resto shamans wear cloth, mp5 and spirit matter more than the armor value.
---
Is this the chromie cinematic?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=80bBqPdjBAs
---
You specifically need 8 Warrior tanks with a 4 set piece bonus that allows them to never miss their taunt, since missing your taunt would not end well.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
The only anecdote here is your post
---
What other solution is there...? Just not have new gear until TBC raid tiers..?
---
I see thanks.
---
If so classic WoW is ruined
---
I just hope that *IF* a BC expansion hapens, the devs take a good look at the item levels of everything. Getting a green off an outlands quest shouldnt be better than raiding gear
---
Exactly, the argument that the drop just means they save gold by not buying it on AH is so flawed. More times than not they probably wouldn't buy it on the AH at all, they'd just have to do without. Everyone needing means the person who could really use it only has a 20% chance to actually get it. It's just not in the spirit of the game and it's wrong. I hope this isn't the attitude people have when the game is out. It certainly wasn't the attitude on my server back in the day.
---
Nearly all of the "theorycrafting to death" has been on unreliable data. What little is rigorous, is working with data so limited that it too is unreliable.
---
The main reason I'm excited about classic is that there won't be expansions.  There won't be a need to progress past that world.
---
They get my subscription for that.  They lose my subscription if all of a sudden it's 'here's a higher level!'.
---
Not claiming to know how many people are like me, just claiming that this whole game is based off of doing something old and static.
---
Of course everything won't be just like it was before, but that's expected.  What is expected is that we won't be rushed in any way.
---
I mean...look at the myriad of comments saying 'I just don't have the time I used to because of my job.'
---
What does that mean?  People that still want to play, but know it may take a really long time to see everything...but also have the money to afford a cheap monthly membership.
---
Blizzard already caters to the people that want constant updates.  Why would they as a business not also cater to the people that don't?
---
But I still can't wait to go back!
---
Does this even count as a shit post?
---
Holy Christ that grell cave was jarring for me trying classic out the first time. I thought I was in STV with all the corpses
---
Thanks!
---
I heard you will be able to play as Lebron James once you hit level 55
---
Good point. I see the light. I will try to come to terms with my ridiculous point of view, and change my ways, and never challenge the sheeple again! xP
---
But it feels so much nicer in vanilla. Were all struggling and dragging ourselves through the dirt towards 60, a little buff is like water in a desert.
---
lol
---
What about TBC pre-classic nerf?
---
Totally thought at least the lower line would be about the release date. After Naxx means pretty much the same thing as after phases, no?
---
Are you even aware of how private server numbers are invented? Lol
---
What was the reasoning for making pally buffs 5 min? It barely lasts!
---
woosh!
---
It's going to release early September, Tuesday September 3rd to be exact. The same time it was originally announced back in 2001 at ECTS.
---
In my experience, I’ve always had people telling me to link DPS meters, link stats/min-max/link warcraftlogs stats, link achievements, wear specific BiS items that are extremely rare to get, have a shit ton of add-ons installed, or something like attach your resume and cover letter just to apply to a raid/guild invite. 
---
I have no problem using and linking a DPS meter but when it gets to that point where I get kicked out of a UBRS group for having 40% crit instead of 80% after someone armories me while I still get #1 / #2 on the DPS meter in that same group then it becomes a problem for me.
---
Imagine thinking 15 years of theorycrafting is a conspiracy. Hunter scaling in late game is trash. Get over it.
---
Please do tell me
---
TBC was absolutely amazing and i really hope they do it again even if it takes 2+years.
---
Hello fellow death knight comrades, I too look forward to death knight adventures in the lands of Azeroth
---
&gt; You realize Greed is literally a picture of gold, right?
---
I downvoted you for this. A dev's UI choices have nothing to do with the social dynamics evolved from how the need/greed functions in practical terms.
---
Honestly I foresee a TBC remaster/rerelease after phases. Vanilla stays and maybe they make other servers start at the beginning of the phases, kind of like a Diablo ladder reset for people wanting to play again.
---
Time to dig up the old "re"post....
---
Yeah, 1.12 was great, but it was only great because of the buildup. The ZG release, the war effort, world bosses, etc. Silithus went from empty to jam packed overnight when the quest hubs were released. It built community and a "history".
---
Azshara is still an underdeveloped zone in 1.12. As seen from explorers, Vanilla has areas where vertical progression can continue. Hyjal, Uldum, etc. There is unused map terrory south of Un'Goro/east of AQ. Hell, patch 1.16 could add an underground instance that could be harder than vanilla Naxx literally anywhere just by putting a portal into a rarely explored hillside or underneath Stromgarde Keep or the Thandol Span in Arathi, and it wouldn't ruin the rest of the Vanilla world. Deadwind Pass might be a good place for it too.
---
There are a lot of gameplay options for the devs. The constraint will be the lore. How you continue to develop "the game" itself without retconning all the TBC-to-present lore?**
---
You could re-create the "War Effort" by requiring the server to complete objectives first before unlocking the content. Imagine some fucking EPIC questline to restore the Thandol Span or build a tunnel out of UnGoro. It could be badass.
---
That was my first mount, the one with flames. This was the first year wow was out. I could be wrong., but I thought it was a chore to get.
---
Yeah, its a shame though that there aren't more endgame class quests. Only lock comes to mind
---
I mean, fishing hasn't changed.. you could do that on retail
---
Just keeping it real with him, man. Think it's pretty asinine to correct a perfectly understandable, well-written comment.
---
Simply an incredible job
---
Yes it does.
---
Im excited, as a shaman, to fill any role needed in dungeon groups.
---
Take a hardcore raiding guild for example.  Look at their 1 or two hunters.  Would you extend your huntard claim to these hunters?  They are bottom-of-the-pack on the DPS meters.  If they really didn't know how to play their class, would they be in the hardcore raiding guild?  And by hardcore in this example I mean like server first status.  I appreciate your hypothesis but this has been shown time and time again.
---
Drink the $15, man. Do it...do it!
---
Woosh!
---
Of course you can. Just have to roll an undead warrior with a name like Blighthead and collect frozen wrath gear.

foudn it!

classic was designed for beginners so yes

managed to find it with google.. reddit's search is awful

yeah....

Literally shed a tear, brilliant.
---
You are the hero we don't deserve.
---
My apologies you are correct, I should have read the thread more carefully
---
Ah I see thanks for the insight, would this mean the same for pvp?
---
TBC was arguebly THE best expansion ever created, and loved by millions of players when WoW was peaking in popularity.
---
What you're saying is just plain wrong.
---
Sticking to your guns...we'll see
---
Literally made up, and well established as inflating particularly the melee numbers your link goes to. There is are an abundance of private server factors that go into changing the meta and misrepresenting classic wow.
---
You're just wrong dude, you won't accept the answers so people are beginning to just put it bluntly lol.

"First time"..."Thought I was in STV"....does not compute
---
Yea we’ll guess what!?!? Your pet is getting might and I’m giving you wisdom. Deal with it
---
So you're right in that you could derive a market value for a BOP item by using the going rate for hiring help.
---
However, by needing on a BOP that you can't use (and will vendor), you are *actively reducing the value of the item*. That is where the difference lies.
---
More Naxx!
---
I run it (the heavily neutered WOTLK version) every week on retail for fun. It’s the main reason I’m excited for Classic. I joined WoW during 1.11 and got to participate in the scourge invasion. I only got to actually do prime Naxx once and that was during TBC. I still have the level 60 Toxin Injector gun on my hunter.
---
It's definitely not the worst of the bunch, but I do see why people say it's bad. I also think it's extremely convenient for queues on lowpop servers.
---
I'm pretty indifferent about that one myself.
---
Its not 15 years of theorycrafting. It's a few months of theorycrafting on a fresh private server, over and over, all of which have been shown to be inaccurate representations of true classic in numerous ways.
---
The guild I raided with up until recently (due to changing work shifts) cleared AQ40 on the first reset on Northdale and are about to clear KT as we speak.
---
Content will go down quick. Not for the average person, but top guilds are gonna blow vanilla content away.
---
What specifically do you know to be unreliable.  You can calculate DPS with a math equation if you have the base weapon damage, speed, and damage coefficients; all of which are proven.  Obviously pservers got shit wrong but not the most core element of the entire game (which is damage).
---
The game starts at 60, dude.
---
People speculate about what comes after the upcoming xpac all the time. No one bitches, because its fun to imagine and speculate on things we don't know. There honestly isn't much to talk about that is new when it comes to Classic because its a known entity. Its mainly sharing tips and talking for the sake of talking. But speculation about content post-naxx is involves creativity in a way that is much more stimulating to talk about.
---
Your tense sounds like you are referring to private servers.
---
Wrath was peak, not TBC.
---
I mean realistically if this becomes a great success, then they would probably just work on BC legacy servers next. Either that, or release "seasonal"/fresh classic realms from time to time so that people can participate in server launch again if they missed it the first time around and still want to be on classic.
---
How they would handle the BC opening would be interesting to see. They could just progress the classic servers and open fresh classic, they could allow character copy from classic to BC, they could just release BC and force everyone to go from lvl 1 on there.
---
One thing I don't think you'll ever see is the whole "making a new story" or added vanilla content that people keep talking about.
---
99% of it is the same dude lol.  Look at old videos and old raid logs.  Their data didn't just come from nothing
---
Just curious what happens to the economy in a server that is around a while?
---
I hope warlocks can summon over the cliff edges in TB.
---
First aid
---
I sincerely believe they are going to use something along the lines of Chromie as the cinematic. Not necessarily the one used at Blizzcon. But I think they are going to tie time travel into the story somehow.
---
So you're right in that you could derive a market value for a BOP item by using the going rate for hiring help and drop rates etc etc.
---
However, by needing on a BOP that you can't use (and will vendor), you are actively reducing the value of the item. That is where the difference lies. So it's not a fair abstraction for BOPs.
---
Effectively BOEs are just stacks of gold that drop, because there is a direct valuation via a real and tangible market
---
I'm actually considering rolling on a RP PvE server. Alot depends on where is the best fit for me because of my schedule. Definitely have to roll a West Coast US server since I dont get home from work till 12:30am EST 4 nights of the week
---
As long as I’m not doing the Shaman water totem quest I am happy
---
I don't know. Flying really got the ball rolling. It's definitely one of the biggest issues that led to where we are now.
---
As a warrior, I'll take any and all the buffs people are willing to hand out...I'll need them all just to make leveling passable.
---
Hopefully they just release a retail WoW in which you can play any of the expansions. TBC private servers will still exist with classic released. And wotlk, and so on.
---
Misdirect lmao.
---
24-30 drakes in Wetlands.
---
36-40 Desolace Hyenas.
---
Basically any drakes/whelplings = good money when combined with Skinning
---
Bro,  my job makes me write my notes in third person. 
---
I feel cringey when I do that,  so actually RPing is definitely gonna make me feel weird
---
These are incredible, well done!
---
As others said, it just starts the cycle over. If anything, I would like to see Classic expand horizontally. This could include new systems like what TBC gave us (sockets), but increasing the cap to invalidate all our work in a few quests is not ok.
---
100% agree. There are tons of options other than BC 2.0 if they decide to progress past Naxx. I think the obvious path is to finish the incomplete zones of the map like you mentioned and add the rest of the zones that were added with Cataclysm. There is even a classic version of Hellfire that was dropped for the BC version. 
---
I keep getting hyped the fuck out thinking about this because I can let my imagination run wild. This reboot would allow Blizz to go back and fix all of their collective fuck ups and progress the game all while maintaining what made classic so different. They have the benefit of hindsight in this particular instance. Of course, this is still only one possibility of many and it's still pretty far away, but I still enjoy thinking about the "what ifs".
---
Is the T16 wearing a Chastity Belt?
---
They'll open new servers like in EQ. Maybe we'll get progression servers.
---
40 man raiding is its own animal. You are in for a treat.
---
I would be so happy if you made one for Warlock. Depending on the contents I could throw some cash your way.
---
What do you do from 30-36
---
The Mechanaar?
---
He doesn't do cinematics, he only updates old in game trailers with newer models, that's a completely differrent skill
---
AQ40 leather is the worst designed armor in human history
---
judging by the scale, this is a small man
---
Yes, just pulled out of thin air!
---
We've never had any sort databases back in vanilla with all the numbers.
---
Nor did we ever make any videos/screenshots to back those numbers up.
---
And the thousands of people who have worked and played on those servers have never played vanilla, so how would they even know what's right or wrong?!
---
Oh and all the people that did play back in vanilla were just total noobs with no prior MMO experience, cause WoW was the first MMO ever!
---
And you're the only one that knows the truth and have a mountain of evidence to back it all up!
---
Every raid brings a 2-3 druids for MotW and Innervate/Bres. you'll find a spot somewhere. You won't be the prettiest girl at the ball, but you also level faster, can pvp with the spec you raid in, and have an easier time with solo mobs imo
---
Looking forward to mages faces when they try to aoe grind at lvl 14 or 20 after being told it’s amazing at low level.
---
Its just a game
---
You go back after weekly reset.
---
Thanks for the help!  For your 8th point so you have any links for guides and stuff?
---
They already answered about sheep, but any casters with instant cast spells could finish off low HP flying opponents if they were willing to risk dismounting for it.
---
The only set that captured it well to me is beaststalker. The shoulders could have been more subtle, however.
---
Run for your life in STV
---
That is why you put BC on a different server. If you are really fighting for blizzard to make a *new* first expansion or rebalance BC, good luck. I dont think anyone wants that.
---
Lightforge initially had an awesome red plate helmet with two little wings off the side. Like a scarlet knight. 
---
It was changed to some weird hat thing later on.
---
That change pissed me off royally.
---
They really don't need to. The Vanilla cinematic is still amazing, it looks even better than the TBC cinematic.
---
Wouldn't mind an upscaled version, though.
---
I leveled my rogue in vanilla almost entirely from SM runs early 20's to near 40 if I remember correctly. Made quite a few friends and we could fly through the instances. Then take all those sweet, sweet dungeon blues and go kill twinks in bg's. Man that was a fun time!
---
It was nice knowing all the pvp players but those queues were ridiculous some days
---
I heard there are gnome mages in the beta.
---
Unfortunately...
---
This is fucking funny

If WoW Classic is really a major success and the choice was up to me I would work on creating horizontal progression for classic using a "alternate universe" history compared to the tbc/wrath/etc we already know.
---
So we would get new content but no flying, limited to no power creep, no xmog. New content would be harder and focus on making you play your class better and making your team/party/guild play better if you wanted to see/clear content. 
---
So for all the BFA people this means harder content but content that is not focused on the shitty gear treadmill we see with mythic runs. 
---
Also I would make sure that new recipies and crafting in any new areas required components from previous areas that came out before it.  I would make sure quest in new zones, dungeons, and raids sent you back to the older areas because now there is more things to do there that link them together.  
---
But overall if I ever make progression in a game of my own I want to always include the "old world" with the new so the entire World feels connected and gives the player to continue to quest, craft, and explore the entire world, not just the latest zone which then becomes obsolete and never visited again once the next zone after that releases.
---
Wtf is European India trial vacation? Does everyone get a month off? If so, I needs gtfo herr
---
It's totally doable, especially if you got some HP pots.
---
I've grinded gnolls in westfall for a bit. Very easy to get yourself killed, but they often have chests and herbs next to them, so worth the risk.
---
I understand your position. Unfortunately the reality is that historic videos have become the most reliable source of information, and no, we dont have a database of that information. It was server side. That's been the major challenge always. Videos end up skewing the numbers very hard in the end. If you can't imagine all the reasons why, then this post isn't for you.
---
Well that's funny, because as I remember, Gnomer was actually designed as the Gnomish faction city first. Then when they realized there would be a faction city imbalance, they hastily filled it with mobs and made it a dungeon.
---
Thanks man I really appreciate the advice. I am looking forward to giving this a shot when it comes out, I like what you had to say about enjoying the game and just take the time to read and enjoy stuff.  When I played with friends years ago briefly I was definitely rushed to get higher leveled, geared all that stuff and I guess I burnt out. I wanted to learn more about Warcraft and its a shame I came on at the end of Lich King/beginning of cataclysm.

---
Like I've tried to express with this post, I think that it is farther off than people assume, having been largely based on video limitations for a decade or so.
---
erp should be a felony
---
Thank you for sharing the class guides! That will be really helpful, I was looking into paladin and hunter mostly. So I’m looking forward to checking out the videos.
---
I mean, imagine playing warrior, where you see dodge/parry twice in a row and have to go. Okay gotta reset, and run away from the mob until it resets.
---
Aoe grinding is possible but can be costly. Mages really fall into the glass cannon spot in classic and you can die fast. AE also eats mana fast and going oom as a mage is close to a death sentince. Cloth has the smallist repair bill but can still add up fast.
---
They have teh same problem ret paladins do
---
They are mana dependent DPS who do physical damage
---
Have to waste too much of the stats on gear on mana. And hunter pets have pretty much static strength they don't scale
---
really hope we never see flying mounts if they happen to go a new different direction after vanilla
---
I didn’t know about PVE servers being able to PVP, I assume you just put on an active status? But thanks for the information!
---
You just reminded me of one of the reasons I disliked warlocks...
---
But the whole cliff summon was also hilarious.
---
I can't complain too much.  Loved the old Dalaran crater portal when I got it.
---
Nice vids. Normally whenever I hear about enhancement dps it's mostly people saying they're solely brought for totems. But looking at this when played correctly an enh shaman seems more than able to pull their weight, especially in earlier raids.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Even if you don't trust pservers, all this shit has been figured out back in vanilla.
---
Despite popular belief, a lot people did actually know what they were doing.
---
If you cant back up your empty claims with some evidence, then maybe you shouldn't have made this post in the first place.
---
yup. It just requires an active sub to play Classic, so go nuts.
---
I just checked your fury DPS test and the numbers are actually pretty close the the enh shaman, doesn't seem very realistic to me something must be off
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnB-meEohms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnB-meEohms) 
---
pre raid 420 shaman vs 488 war
---
bis gear 620sham  770 warrior.
---
The difference is too small, if thoses were real number we wouldn't have so many fury and more enh since they have a lot more utility
---
I agree TBC isn’t BFA, so let’s not make that connection. 
---
But how many people do you end up catering for? I would say WOTLK was my favourite time in wow, had good group of friends playing, connecting with the story because of wc3... but even I know I can’t always get my way or the playerbase will suffer.
---
I think the best way is split the player base once Classic/Retail. Retail has to keep going it’s kept the game alive for 19 years that in itself deserves some serious respect, but we want classic and are lucky enough to get it.
---
I don’t want to see them further split us by making a “classic” server for every expansion because you’ll find that there will always be someone who wants something else. 
---
For example if they added TBC servers there would be just as much justification for them to add wotlk further splitting the base, so not a good idea imo.
---
Hence back to I think classic should be continued on post naxx, keeps us the player base split once and doesn’t create the whole “but they got what they wanted, why can’t I have what I want”
---
How is it a shitshow? Go try rs3 where you dont vote on shit, and when you do and the vote doesnt go jagex way they either do it anyway or revote. Theres a reason osrs playerbase is 10/1 rs3.
---
As a broke hunter who had a pet crab I would often whisper mages and ask them for some conjured bread so that Crabies ( yes, a crab with Rabies ) doesn t starve
---
I cant think of any class with t0 in their list of preraid bis. Is there one?
---
Do NOT try to solo Hogger
---
Warrior is bad, but it's not THAT bad. Unless you pulled a mob at like 40% health (what the fug are you doing), getting 2 dodge/parry will not kill you.
---
For sure, AoE grinding is ballsy. There is no middle ground with it, you either win or you die nearly instantly.
---
The interesting thing is at a certain amount of agility survival can give you more AP than marks, but then you don’t buff your party.  You can push your own dps but at the overall detriment of the raid. It’s pointless to compete against other classes it’s apples and oranges
---
Its never bis for rogues. All t0 sets are considered bad for the most part.
---
The closest a Hunter ever came to being GOOD was post-survival tree revamp, in basicially vanilla BiS-Forever gear. And they are ALMOST good. Except they had zero group synergy which further dropped value over taking something else that could do the job better sufficiently to make it up or brought more useful group synergy while putting out similar values (or sufficiently powerful group synergy).
---
Your point of corpse camping is a big point on why I asked about it, this happened when I played my brief time on wow and my time on old republic. It’s fun at first to duel win or lose but when they just hunt you it’s annoying as hell and I’m not great at mmo combat so I’ll take pve into huge consideration.
---
I will say "thanks dog" to every one of you people.
---
Idc if I'm a rogue who just got int, it's the thought that counts
---
Most of them suck just look for good guides on specific things
---
There is no holistic classic content creator that just has the best guides for everything.
---
Yes, this would be cool. Even if you could simply copy your character to this TBC realm and continue that way. You would keep your 60 on a Vanilla server but be able to progress the same char to 70 should you wish.
---
Right at 14, the gnoll camps north of Stone Cairne Lake in Elwynn are doable and give some easy xp/cloth/silver for early game spells etc since they often drop a hammer that vendors for over 1s. There's also a rare in the area if you get lucky with a spawn.
---
It won't help you at all unless you need practice using WASD.
---
Not useful he was asking about first principles
---
My go to is https://www.joanasworld.com. it's made by the guy who has the retail vanilla world record speed run and Its always been really good for me. He's actually completely redone his guide for classic and is currently in the process of making/redoing his guide for both factions and all classes which is really sick.
---
Vr ?
---
That's over 8 hours a day 26 months...
---
[It's possible](https://youtu.be/PPBsAyzuZgM?t=6266)
---
I understood it as him talking about a specific set, not items in general my mistake.
---
Private server.
---
Current wow is broken to hell as soon as u hit lvl 10
---
:)
---
Yeah. The two of us have been playing around a pserver a bunch, and I've been messing around on BfA a little bit, and it's like night and day even if you pick the same class. Warrior was probably the most egregious difference to me (retail warriors had me expecting a fairly mobile juggernaut with endless rage, vanilla, not so much).
---
Uhm, early levels (sub 24) getting 2 dodge/parry wont kill you. But getting 2 early, puts you in a dangerous position. Miss an auto and heroic? Now you have 0 rage and have done no damage. Miss/dodge/parry 1-2 more autos and you are instantly dead. Its safer to reset and try again.  
---
Its cautious play that adds a bit of time to each pull, 10-15 seconds on unlucky pulls. But you never get a run-back because you get unlucky.
---
Nice. I'm thinking 21/0/30. With a UF I should still be hitting pretty decent no?
---
We have a massive amount of info from 1.12....
---
Things like stats are very easy to datamine
---
The expansion after WotLK, Cataclysm, basically completely revamped everything in Azeroth. Not only would none of the class mechanics/skills be anything like Classic in the current BfA patch, but there wouldn't even be similar quests in starting areas. Hell, some starting areas don't even *exist* anymore (Trolls and Gnomes, for instance, completely lost their "ancestral homelands").
---
Just cool your jets and read a few nice books, and play Classic when Classic releases. Playing 1-20 in BfA does nothing for you except passing the time.
---
I played a mage on a TBC private server recently, I really did enjoy it for being able to do things like teleport people around the world (and myself) and make food and water and all the other fun utilities the mage has. But, as you said, I am probably going to play something else this time around, not really sure why, but I think I would get bored of the mage really fast in Vanilla content. I think I would enjoy Priest a lot or even possibly Lock.
---
Int levels your weapon skills faster!!
---
Was just having this discussion the other day.
---
Hopefully it’ll be just like osrs, fresh dungeons, maybe finish the unfinished areas like hjyal and Kara
---
Misdirect came in BC you pleb!! :P
---
Had to find the meme that describes my nightly feeling, this fit lol
---
I'm very late to this party, but hope at least the OP sees this comment.  I'm glad you brought this up, because it's something that means a lot to me.
---
I know and play with a lot of people that love achievements.  Personally though, I detest them.
---
I love having things to do and discover just for the very reason of just doing or discovering them.  No rewards, no checklist, no anything other than 'hey, I did/I saw/I experienced this'.
---
Achievements, to me, make it a less personal thing.  It makes it a global checklist to be knocked off...rather than something you do if you enjoy it, or don't do if you have no interest in it.
---
Once i get to the lower 50s I generally just dungeon my way to 60
---
If u wanted to farm runes that would work, probably would want the hit chance tho from prot
---
By law. Every European citizen has atleast 4 weeks of payed vacation.
---
It's not only great for morale, but also helps keep things like factories in top shape. Many places stop production for x weeks and do major repairs/maintenance or change their production line.
---
That said you don't have to take those 4 weeks during the summer. But most do.
---
Less kiddies
---
Oooh interesting. Why? If you want to Rp PvP you can just use an RP server and have people manually flag no?
---
Undead.
---
&gt; I think I would enjoy Priest a lot
---
I've been thinking about that as well.
---
&gt; or even possibly Lock.
---
Heretic!
---
-----
---
Sorry, old differences surfaced there ; )
---
It's a tough choice!  I've considered...well...every class for the most part...
---
Lol
---
where can i find where this official decision will be
---
It won’t do anything for you knowledge or skill wise. But you might enjoy it.
---
Huh. Sick. Til
---
Agreed 100% What’s the point of a separate retro classic wow sever if they’re going to expand it?  
---
Bring back Classic and *keep it classic*.  How is this a radical concept for people
---
You get to punt gnomes
---
=)
---
1. Your gear needs to at least be current or you're mostly going to have a bad time.
---
2. Not really. The best (only real) spec for PvP is Mortal Strike. This will be fine for dungeons and stuff but won't cut the mustard in raids. Everyone raids with Fury.
---
Completely different, 1-20 is a few hours in retail and you will have like 3 abilities at the end of it. Everything is a faceroll at low level and your regen is insane.
---
It’s probably not ridiculous to say that after naxx rolls out on the initial servers they will roll out ‘fresh’ servers some time afterwards . Some of the tourists who came to try it out probably won’t re-roll, and then some of the burnt out hardcore players will quit.  However some of the new players will want to try try it again, but this time they’re not new anymore, and hardcore players will of course be drawn to fresh servers like how people hop from P-server to P-server.  Overall population is likely to decay, but a game that has no updates, and never will doesn’t seem hard to maintain.
---
No same-level quest mob hits so hard on mail/plate that getting 2 dodge/parry will make the mob kill you.
---
This is A big discussion and they are talking to streamers for advice and feedback.
---
I am not in complete agreement with you. The retail crew already infinitely screwed up the time line and lore with WoD and then basically just ignored the fact that what happened in WoD erased the first three Warcraft (not world of warcraft but the rts') from the timeline and canon. 
---
So a separate timeline would absolutely sit ok with most people if the new timeline was planned out better than ever expansion in retail has been.
---
No hate toward you friend, I just think we could do as you say but in a slightly different way. I made a longer post in this thread about exactly that!
---
I’m sure it’s a funny story but I don’t know what illusionary rod is.
---
If you're joining the group as feral DPS, sure, assuming they are good for the build you're playing in that group. If you're tanking/healing and need the items for offspec, I'd say the usual offspec rules apply; ask first.
---
Because zug zug
---
I admire you’re desperation, but I’m afraid you’re entirely wrong. Hunters fall off very hard after AQ in both PvE and PvP. Hunters in Classic will not perform better than they did in Vanilla or on private servers.
---
Damn these mindsets are actual cancer
---
what the fuck is RP anyway? do people actually pretend they are a character? cuz that just seems really weird.
---
To a degree everyone is living their class fantasy when they play the game. But taking it to such a degree is like, really weird?
---
Idk i try not yuck people's yum but RP gives me furry vibes
---
&gt; Eventually we'll need new content.
---
Why? The whole point of Classic is to revisit a brilliant game that we can no longer play anymore. I don't boot up my N64 to play Super Mario and then get upset that it doesn't have new content.
---
WoW's entire life has always been rushing to meet constantly moving goalposts before Blizz sets you back to 0 every couple months. For ONCE can't we just have a game that isn't constantly changing, that we can come back to time and time again and have it still be the same game we know and love? Is that so much to ask?
---
Yeah because a raid with just warriors rogues and mages is fun right? That’s how the game was meant to be played.
---
Play what you want because I guarantee the majority of your friends are not prepared to hit 60
---
You get to play as something much more interesting than your typical  Tolkien fantasy races. Relish the chance for a whole new experience.
---
&gt;From a PvE perspective, flying in TBC was fine. The 70 zones were designed with flying in mind, and being able to skip trash you didn't want to fight in lowbie zones was a straight quality of life improvement and not really much different to what epic mounts did in vanilla.
---
I thought it trivialized the danger of moving around in PvE as well.  It was always fun taking a chance and plowing through mobs on a mount to speed up moving around on the ground.  They might knock you off and then you'd have to kill them or escape.  It gave the game terrain where you had to make choices between this direction or that based on speed and danger.  Flying mounts got rid of all that.
---
*laughs in PvE server*
---
Blast trade chat for everything
---
I don't remember in TBC as I never even tried it then, but I know for a fact in WotLK that knockback spells dismounted people. From what I remember, mages, shamans, and druids could all use knockback spells to knock people off their flying mounts, making them plummet to their deaths.
---
Only a small number of players thought to do it, but you could take advantage of this at raid locations such as Naxxramas in particular, where if you were lucky, entire raids would be tightly grouped together at the entrance. So you could swoop in and knock them all off, dismounting them to suffer massive repair bills.
---
If you didn't have a spell to survive the fall yourself, you could use a parachute from engineering, which had to be carefully timed because it only lasted 60 seconds, and it'd wear off far too soon if you used it when too high up.
---
Because of complaining on the forum from the small minority of players who got ganked this way, especially tanks who were hit hardest with repair bills, spells were changed to no longer dismount in one of WotLK's later patches.
---
Hunters were also excellent at tracking down AFK fliers, since they had Track Humanoids which all other classes had to use food to get, and they had several instant cast spells you could use in succession, finishing with your Serpent Sting DoT at the last second for maximum damage. You'd dismount as far above them as possible while in LoS, do all the damage you can, fall, parachute, then repeat if necessary until you've left someone who thought they were safe at the top of the world dead and confused when they get back. In MoP when low levels were allowed to fly, hunters became the best at ganking, because you could one shot people in the air who thought they were safe and would /laugh at you as they flew away.
---
Keep making noise on the forums. Don't sit idle and allow Blizz/Activision to milk their loyal consumers with practically forced (paid) realm transfers. That's likely their goal. Such bullshit.
---
&gt;have people manually flag
---
This part doesn't work out.
---
It's a great meme and all, but I think the conversation has moved away from that sort of stuff.  In general there seem to be more posts like this that keep bringing up the damn subject.
---
technically the nerf was because they were WAAAAY too strong in PvP, due to survival scaling better than expected in the new gear.
---
Discord. Or those Guild things
---
They got rid of any chance of knocking people off mounts in Wrath. A friend of mine leveled a mage just so he could sheep people off mounts and then they made flying mounts immune.  He was so pissed.
---
&gt; You're not just skipping mobs, you're also skipping literally any possibility of interaction with players.
---
Is "interaction" code for "getting ganked"? Because if you *want* to interact with other players you can just fly low enough to see what grounded players are up to, and hop off to buff them or help them or whatever if you feel like it.
---
Like I said, I see that it reduces random PvP. But from a PvE perspective what "any possibility of interaction with other players" are you worried about that you can't experience just by flying low?
---
&gt; Straight-line AFK flying is also a lot more boring than weaving between mobs to avoid getting dismounted.
---
Nobody took ground mounts away if that is what you find fun, and epic ground mounts were faster than normal flying ones.
---
&gt; There's also a lot of problems with calling just anything that "removes an annoying part of the game" as "quality of life". 
---
I didn't claim that *anything* that removes an annoying part of the game is good QoL, just that flying mounts were. Deal with it.
---
&gt; You had plenty of pricks in Hellfire that'd just fly from point to point and avoid a fight.
---
So you need a group for group PvP. I am okay with this.
---
&gt; Let me give you something equivalent:
---
How about something actually equivalent, instead of something totally stupid?
---
&gt; Also, it's good to see that anyone whose interests do not align with you just gets a "screw you, deal with it" because you just cannot deal with not flying yourself.
---
You're the one who is apparently massively butthurt by other people liking different things, or by people getting something you didn't want them to have.
---
&gt; Also I just love the absolute arrogance to suggest that PvPers could adapt but did not. Do you really think people didn't try? Or do you care to suggest some new revolutionairy ideas?
---
They coped. PvP still happened. They still played on PvP servers. There were still always places you could pick a fight if you really wanted one.
---
What you are doing here is being a crybaby because there wasn't a way to make it exactly like it was before flying mounts. Of course there wasn't. Things change and you either adapt or whine about it.
---
Probably not, with no nostalgia you'll just be playing an old poorly designed game (please dont downvote, half the specs arent viable) 
---
You're probably better off starting in retail for a more polished game, or better yet wait till it comes out, try both and play the one you prefer, if you like the conveniences and balance changes then enjoy retail, if you dont mind slower gameplay and like the player agency and control of your character then play classic
---
Also if you start in retail you might go into classic with a more forgiving mindset, old games are fun to go back to but they wouldnt sell as new games today
---
Then what happens when half the playerbase hates the content added to Naxx? Do we then get Blizzard to make Classic Classic Wow?
---
Funny enough. The top post of all time on this sub is someone suggesting exactly this. So I dont know why peoples minds changed so bad. I think the 07scape model is a great idea as long as they dont screw it up.
---
Okay, using the only data we have: hunter is a utility class that is used for aoe slows, mob kiting, and mob pull resetting. 
---
Their dps, using the faulty data that we have, is lower than almost every other class. 
---
Their strength is not in dps, but their ability to kite, slow down big packs of mobs, and break combat.
---
Well, if they decided to roll into a progression server model, with BC, WoLK, etc...I will quite literally be playing their game for the rest of my life. 
---
Source: I’m old...
---
this is one of the very few changes I would be okay with. Meeting stones in vanilla serve no purpose and at least at my server were never used. If you are already at the instance you have a group and since nobody else travels there without having a group you will never find one while using them. 
---
I dont think its NECESSARY to change that, however they absoluly could be just removed if they work like they did since they are completly useless.
---
True, but with epic speed mounts there was almost always plenty of room to run between mobs without any real danger, and flying mounts were equivalent in cost to epic ground mounts.
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they not only lost Azshara *and* Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place?
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*
---
Something something just RP on a PVP server
---
I se and this with a more horizontal progression path. Harder content that requires more skill than higher and higher ilvls.
---
Our tank back in Cats used a foot pedal - usually they are used to pause and play audio for typing up recorded dictation, but he tweaked it to bind key movement stuff to it. We always knew he was getting too excited and into his music when he started running all over the place.
---
r/diwhy
---
Just make tbc servers with the ability to copy characters to it.
---
No changes should mean no changes, and I should get to experience my favorite expansion how it was, like you are going to be able to with Classic.
---
Far from being as effective as an efficient solo questing route. Dungeons are a lot of fun and everything, but from an XP/HR standpoint they're absolute dogshit.
---
that would be the dream. Horizontal progression, new raids but not increased level cap. I would be so in for that. But first I am really looking forward to relive the classic experiance :) Such good dungeons at 60!
---
Ciekawy jestem i Polaków będą grać...
---
Ok, so your telling me that 2 years of theorycrafting back when vanilla was live is invalid? I'm sorry but you consistently make claims and statements with no evidence to back it up. Put up shut up man.
---
&gt; True, but with epic speed mounts there was almost always plenty of room to run between mobs without any real danger
---
I see you never tried to go cross country in Winterspring on an epic mount.  My record was about 2 minutes before being dismounted.
---
This is *perfect*.  Seriously man, I had chills there at the end.  Thank you!
---
WHAT IF: The dark portal opens but all zones are 45 to 60, no new levels and Kara, Gruuls, Magtheridon are the same iLvL as Naxx, or even a few pts below?
---
Times like these we could always use some [folksy wisdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QEAA94FjHc&amp;app=desktop&amp;t=3m5s)
---
It does a good job of explaining each totem, and explaining totem twisting, but unless I missed it, it doesn't really answer the question of how often I'm going to have to lay down totems in a raid setting. 
---
Lets say I'm lazy (i am) and I don't want to twist totems. Can I just use them on CD or is their too much party movement in most fights? Am I constantly having to replace them beyond their CD is basically what I want to know.
---
This just convinced me.
---
1. Kind of. The real issue will be how fast your Priest gets tunneled and dies and then you're just a solo, under-geared Warrior. If your Priest is experienced, then you'll do "ok" until he is oom. But yea, an undergeared Warrior is the most useless class and will be frustrating without gear.
---
2. You should be spec'd optimally for PvE, since PvP performance is secondary. PvE Fury is not that bad in PvP, but nobody serious will queue with you because how can you not have MS in PvP?! Can still queue with your buds and have a good time. Gear still matters more as in point 1.
---
In your case, if you enjoy Mage, play Mage. Everyone thinks if your buddy is playing a healer, you have to go Warrior (they're sleeping on Lock + Priest). Realistically, any good player that gets a pocket healer is lethal.
---
Hmm, didn't realize it was that far behind. 
---
I used to love healing/tanking tho, and questing as those specs was hard, so I used to dungeon a lot. 
---
Will probably heal/tank in DPS specs this time, should be fine for lower levels, and can quest efficiently too
---
Hunter Jack of all trades of sorts, not even close to best at anything outside of kiting maybe
---
Classic is for preserving video game history, a museum server in Blizzard words. Modern WoW is already there for milking players.
---
Exactly. Speccing as a tank or a healer while leveling up is just a waste of your time and there is absolutely zero reason to do it. It's much better to just tank or heal in your standard leveling spec so you have the ability to both solo quest and do dungeons! :D
---
I've been a Horde hype man for going on twenty years now. Glad to see I haven't lost my touch! ;)
---
Though Sylvanas is making things *pretty* ***fucking*** *difficult* for me with the burning of Teldrassil. I like to blame it on whatever shadowy definitely-not-the-Loa powers lied to Vol'jin about crowning Sylvanas and also may or may not be giving Jaina a years-long nervous breakdown.
---
Why wouldnt they throw up a fresh realm to keep subs and maybe some new ones? How hard is that for them to do really? A couple mouse clicks? It's not catering to shit really. Except thier own pockets.
---
"Trying classic out" Come on man don't be ignorant.
---
It would genuinely surprise me if they adopted the private server community's freshy fresh fresh culture.
---
&gt; and in the next patch of BFA, they are adding water-walking for ALL mounts, which pissed off the people who spent the time to grind Anglers rep from MoP for the waterstrider mount.
---
Just... why? Not only does this make no sense, but why do people even *need* to waterwalk on all mounts?
---
True. And people liked it. But it was not as good as TBC and vanilla.
---
 Lok'tar Ogar, For the HORDE!
---
Just keep the cybering and ERP private and no one cares. People care when you're doing that shit in /say and being obnoxious about it.
---
People know how to play them but when raids only have limited number of slots for a hunter, its disheartening.
---
Definitely. Best place start imo.
---
It would? Lol ok..... because reasons right?
---
wear them until about 30
---
They'll still want to PvP and not manually flag. It's just a thing for MMOs that don't designate. The roleplay community in general picks a server and gets the word out.
---
Oh by the way, Tool announced August 30th! Literally just a few minutes ago.
---
Because fresh hype dead breeds burnout faster than any progression of expansions ever would, that's some really basic stuff haha. And not something blizzard will be interested in fostering in its players, that is a uniquely private server created issue.
---
There's some great things about Horde for sure!
---
- Getting to take advantage of windfury is a plus! All warriors like bigger numbers, and having your pet shaman to drop a yellow number box whenever you want is a great feature to have!
---
- It's a lot easier to move around the continents as Horde with zeps to UC and Grom'gol and a firm foothold in the middle(ish) of Kalimdor!
---
It all depends on what your priorities are. If you're willing to sacrifice what you wanna play race/class wise to appease this group, it seems like they matter a lot to you. But if thinking about and fantasizing about this is causing you stress and unhappiness, maybe you need to evaluate if playing a Dwarf Hunter without your friends is more net happiness overall? Weigh your options and decide what would make the best experience for you.
---
And remember you always have the chance to change your mind. If you get up to level 30 and are just not having fun in the slightest, and every time you see an alliance character you get envious, maybe it's time to entertain the idea of switching.
---
I hope things work out! &lt;3
---
Or maybe yknow play another game? We have so many options, no need to rush
---
Pass. I wasn't a big RPer but I rolled on an RP-PVP server back in the day. As long as you played along people were cool. The benefit was that the kind of people that roll on an RP-PVP server make for the best community. Good people, kind people mostly. Never saw a better community in vanilla than on RP-PVP compared to regular PVP servers. Self selection and all.
---
Who would you talk to?
---
I want to kill dragons in east wetlands
---
Oh. I didnt see anywhere where they said the opposite of saying they arnt making TBC. Source?
---
And maybe they will make those RP PVP servers, but if they don't, it's up to us to craft that sub-community ourselves through guilds and communication and organization.
---
Personally, I think the new talent trees are slightly better as they give at least a few choices here and there depending on whether you want to do PvP or PvE, AoE or St, while the old system offers basically what amounts to an illusion of choice. 
---
That being said, I agree with you. They should have let us keep all our spells. There was no reason to remove them besides perhaps further simplifying the game for new players.
---
They really don't. I played TBC and I absolutely hate BFA. The gearing is different, the raids are different in scope etc.
---
Haha you got em dude!! Now they feel insulted for you calling them out without any sort of verifiable proof!
---
When I grinded to rank 11...
---
dO yOu GuYs NoT hAvE pHoNeS?
---
I don't think re-releasing TBC even though it was a great exp will keep players. If they do anything after classic, they better bring some new shit, re-washing expansion after expansion is just retail all over.
---
Playing a TBC server right now. It's absolutely nothing like BFA
---
&gt; One thing I don't think you'll ever see is the whole "making a new story" or added vanilla content that people keep talking about.
---
I do not think so either but one can always hope and at least voice this idea. It makes the most sense to just continue to progress without having to dedicate resources to new content. But man, I sure would love a continuation of classic rather than TBC.
---
&gt;What's the point of doing anything except farm gold from greys all day and buying BOEs from AH if we abstract all items to their AH value?
---
Maybe because you cannot buy BoP items from AH??
---
Why is this such difficult concept for you people to understand?
---
You go to dungeons to get BoP items, not some random BoE. 
---
So if BoE does drop, it's a fair game for everyone, because everyone can use the gold.
---
&gt; group teamwork to clearing a dungeon and the reward of that effort 
---
Exactly! So why should just one guy get the 100g jackpot?
---
&gt; If it's a BOE upgrade and the person will equip it 
---
And if they cant because of level requirement? How can you be sure that he wont just AH later?
---
How can you be sure that he doesn't already have that item, or even something better in his inventory/bank?
---
&gt; Everyone else rolls greed 
---
And how can you guarantee that?
---
&gt; Reputation means more in classic  
---
Do you really think that anyone will care about some random lvl 36 hunter ninjaing a BoE?
---
The whole point of having everyone need on BoEs is that it prevents ninjas while giving everyone a fair chance at the jackpot.
---
&gt; If I am leveling and see a great BOE upgrade I would be pissed if a rogue ninjad my priest upgrade 
---
If a sack of 100g dropped that you were not allowed to roll on for w/e reason, would you not be pissed?
---
&gt; I don't have time or money to farm for that specific item
---
Why is that my problem?
---
If there's a BoE item that I actually NEED, I will find the time to farm money for it, instead of hoping to win the BoE lottery
---
Yes they do?
---
As long as you have 2500 people on your classic server then don't worry about population. Blizz classic will always have at least this many people.
---
I would love to see a *new* expansion from level 60 to 70 feels more like vanilla but uses all the modern technology now available to blizzard.
---
Just make sure it has the following:
---
1. NO flying mounts.
---
2. NO LFG tool.
---
3. NO homogenized classes.
---
Why is it not a good idea to offer progress through expansions? Sounds like an amazing idea. I'd love to play through to Cata again.
---
I just think it would be easy for blizz to do up until wotlk. People argue that they enjoyed tbc/wotlk more than vanilla so there would be no shortage of players interested both old and new. I'd love to progress classic, but it's much more of an investment from blizzard than rereleasing BC/wotlk
---
You keep using that word. I'm not sure you know what it means.
---
You can not have that because it is unsustainable. Wow is fun because of the community, according to this sub. No new content means community dwindles down to the point where you cant even form groups for content. Classics raiding and pvp system is designed around having a LOT of players.
---
I played alliance from Vanilla thru Cata. I'm playing Horde because I want to discover things I've never seen or known before. I've played melee the least, so I'm playing warrior. I've never played on a pvp server, so this time I am. I didn't level cooking, this time I am. etc.
---
Basically, I want to capture some of the magic and I don't think I would get that going through the "rehearsed" path I've gone before. Embrace ignorance and innocence my friend. See you in Azeroth.
---
You could just bring shamans to heal and drop wf for warriors and rogue. Better that way.
---
Then where does it end? Cause eventually they would get back to WoD and have to watch everyone leave.  They need to just drop classic and leave it at that.  Classic will be really popular at launch but then it’s going drop fast in active users.  People complain retail is still too hard  wait till they have to spend 2+ days /played with no mounts.
---
I used to put curse of recklessness on low level horde because it's basically a buff (+90ap and immunity to fear).
---
Holding out for WotLK
---
Why does it always seem like horde is inferior to alliance on pservers ?
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=7713/illusionary-rod
---
Clearly the players want a shop to buy exclusive mounts !
---
Been having an awful time getting people to instances in the same scenario. I hope that changes. I'm also not going to mind if they did allow meeting stones to summon. No changes crowd in that case would not have my support.
---
&gt;More times than not they probably wouldn't buy it on the AH at all, they'd just have to do without 
---
And that's the beauty of it, you get to decide what you want to do with that money. 
---
If you're struggling, you can buy an upgrade, or you can use it for mount/profs/consumes/etc
---
&gt; It's just not in the spirit of the game and it's wrong. 
---
Why do you get to decide what is the spirit of the game and what is wrong or right?
---
&gt; I hope this isn't the attitude people have when the game is out. 
---
That's how most groups handle it on pservers.
---
&gt; It certainly wasn't the attitude on my server back in the day. 
---
The attitude changed after people got tiered of getting screwed by ninjas
---
I love vanilla. I’ve been waiting for official servers for like four years. 
---
That said, I think this sub is a little deluded as to how popular vanilla will be. For many reasons. Only a very select minority actually wants to work for their shit anymore.
---
Most people log on after work to turn their brains off, not to be massively engaged. 
---
But hopefully I’m wrong.
---
I can get some pretty bad hand tremors, and before I learned breathing techniques and got a gaming mouse with weights that compensated for these, they could be disruptive (drugs take care of them now mostly).
---
However, it was nothing as disruptive as when I needed on that plate helmet from the end of RFD (Icemetal Barbute) as a mage due to a tremor. I could barely type out an apology my hand was shaking so hard after that. Thankfully my guildies were able to smooth it out while I dealt with my demon hand.
---
&gt; I resubbed to retail recently just to see how it was. It's blues and purples everywhere and it's impossible to keep up with.
---
Been like that for ages. I played Wrath for a while back in the day, and even though I didn't run anything but Dungeon Finder, I had a full set of epics. (My gearscore was trash tho)
---
*so much Violet Hold*
---
Come on, guys. This meme was created less than 3 weeks ago, and yet it's upvoted to oblivion anyways. Wow.
---
So damn true.
---
You’re*
---
I kind of hope that if classic is a success they release new content like how Jagex handles OSRS. Basically make classic WoW a separately developed game. With the older graphics engine I imagine it would be cheaper to develop for. Even if the imitated some of the retail content but it kept it level 60 and within the classic map and design principles. It would be simple to add islands, portals, underground areas, etc. Leave the classes, just more content.
---
Please don’t Downvote this guy lol. I love the blood feud
---
This is basically how private servers have worked for years now, and is what Blizz will end up doing. No idea why people still keep asking this question over and over...
---
There's no money in making things past wotlk. You can experience the new world changes of cata in retail so nobody will care for it.
---
Lmao. Spamming chain heal (rank 1) is for sure 200IQ. 🙄
---
Unpopular opinion: bc was shit lol, id prefer fresh vanilla servers
---
It is.  But from my perspective as a healer, there were 12 mechanics and I needed to know 2 or 3 of them.  That's when I kind of lost interest in how "complex" a fight was.
---
That's why I think for the sake of nostalgia and uniqueness give it to the druid, who played that far into the game as a crappy healer who can't dps and is there for the utility. Just look at the other people posting, they imagine it would basically never go to a druid. That is sad because it isn't the same thing as giving thunderfury to a hunter, Atiesh seems like a good weapon for druids, and so few will have a chance to get it given that other guilds are min-maxing it. As a class I think they make a lot of concessions in raids so it seems fair, obviously every case is unique and the people behind the classes probably matter much more in the end.
---
Virtual Reality. You know with the VR headset.
---
Well there aren't many movement intensive fights in Classic and with the talent "totemic mastery" your totems are 30 yard range (40 yard range if you also have tier 1), and basically you'll drop whatever totems you are going to use for that fight before the pull and just heal during the actual fight. Totem twisting is really the only time you'll be constantly replacing totems and you only do that in higher levels of gear and as a min/max option. So, assuming you're lazy, you're good to just drop your totems pre-pull and focus on healing.
---
alliance aoe peons in arathi IIRC. Alliance tends to have more aoe options but some of the options aren't as amazing as horde spots (hillsbrad).
---
I just love casting fortitude on players, having them stand still when they realize it, then they usualy buff me back or say something nice :) 
---
Also very fun on low level players when you double their health!
---
It wasn't that people hated the convenience, it's that the convenience had the unintended effect of taking away identity within the game. Granted I haven't played in a long time, but last time I did WoW felt like an endless sea of faceless players that you will never again see. Like the difference between a big city or a small town. Sure a small town might feel limited to a big city fella, but couldn't you agree that there is a compelling draw to the small town life?
---
I think that ultimately at the core what I hope to get back is that identity, that sense of self on the server. Changes and improvements can erode that in unforseen ways, and a lot of inconveniences can actually contribute to the world building (mail delay, for example).
---
Despite people's seemingly unfavorable view of Blizzard, I do think that there's been a lot of lessons learned. What we know so far proves that the team working on classic can make these QoL changes without negatively impacting server communities.
---
I think it's less likely than the BC route. But if they don't do BC I could see fresh servers being released later on
---
You're quite welcome.
---
You quit at the right time, see you this summer sir
---
You should try everything once ;)
---
Bruh if only she’d just turn around and attacked them... one hemo would take each out lmao.
---
My pleasure! ;-)
---
Yeah constantly staring at your threat meter and holding back dps is so much fun while Alliance Warriors can go ham without ever worrying about aggro.
---
so they have something else to do than right clicking
---
Thanks mate. I want to heal in Classic, but I think I want to keep it as simple as possible.
---
I've heard for Classic the simplest healer is Paladin, where your Flash of Light HoT for your MT. I would actually dig that, but sadly I'd have to be Alliance scum ):
---
Yo, just do top 5 and bottom 5 man. I don't have time to tell you my 16th vs 17th favorite instance...
---
Also, this interaction sucks as a sorting exercise.
---
Horde race racials are better for tanking - Namely Tauren. (Orc for dps)
---
Also alliance models are complete ass in vanilla. Namely dwarves and gnomes, and especially on warrior.
---
Do you want to have a sweet looking huge sword on your warrior, just to have it clip through the ground when you run with it? Because that’s the dwarf and gnome experience in vanilla.
---
I want my emerald meme
---
I want it upscaled to 1080p or higher, but I don't think they can do that as well as I'd want without finding the old files and re-rendering it
---
My point of view is, if it stays „classic“ in it’s core principles even with new content it could be even more brilliant. There is so much background story where blizz could build on and never spoken out stories they could tell us. There was so much content they wanted to release with classic but couldn‘t due to different reasons. It wouldn‘t be a change for me because the intention to release was there but the plans to release were repeatedly shot down.
---
It would excite me even more if Blizzard would release new content but in a classic way. But I am pretty sure it won‘t happen.
---
You are missing the point. It's not only because of saving time, you might not even kill a certain boss without... Not because it's impossible without the buff, but because your gear isn't good enough or the average skill of the raid isn't good enough. The buff can be the thing that helps you get the last 1-2% of Ragnaros for example so you actually kill him instead of whiping.
---
Don’t forget Darkshore...those little gremlins are thick there too.
---
I didn't spend a huge amount of time in the old world on an epic mount, I didn't get one until TBC, but I don't remember ever having problems getting anywhere I wanted to go on one. Possibly my memory is biased in that I was a tank in TBC and for some reason it seemed like tanks never got dismounted - dunno why, I don't think anyone ever fully theorycrafted out how dismounting worked. Probably high Defence, but who knows?
---
They never "designed" around flying.  You always had to level up the first time through the new expansion without flying so you couldn't skip all the content, and then they gave you flying at max level so you could fly over everything.
---
I remember warlocks doing that to me after I'd give them arcane intellect (or water if they asked nicely). Often times I was in comically dry zones like badlands or searing gorge. It's the thought that counts.
---
Yup. I made a few million during BFA launch, and have capped BNet balance that will eventually get converted to [game time](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time)
---
Humans are by far the best tanks in vanilla because of weapon skill.
---
Classic wow live for two years than BC servers open up....pay to transfer character or level up on new server. 
---
Good way to get the cash flow going. 
---
BC had some great content.
---
as previous poster explained, that means you will stay at a low rank.  Better go for some pve set, T1 or T2 much easier
---
Because Alliance has a much easier time in both PvE and PvP. Also Alliance has far less travel time than Horde for the first 2 raid tiers.
---
I'd rather see planned content that never got into Vanilla implemented than go to to TBC. I don't see a reason to just follow the path of TBC then WoTLK then Cata which eventually wrecked the game. I'd rather simply see the heart of the classic wow game design preserved with new content being tastefully added like Karazhan, Emerald Dream, Dragon Isles etc. and have a more OSRS type of feel to it.
---
It's funny, classic wow is being made for a niche of players, some of whom admittedly were too butt hurt at the idea of expansions that they quit during TBC, and this niche of gamers want to be appeased by blizzard but also want to ignore content decay. What is this niche going to do, level one of each class and max raid gear then all? Then what? Do they just want to run max forever and nothing to ever be added past that? This won't be feasible for the playerbase required forna healthy server or for blizzard to justify continued support of the servers. 
---
Realistically. This is a way for blizzard to make a new "wow" and possibly even make it better. I for one would rather have them do new post-naxx content based within the framework of classic than for then to rehash the same expansions. What will they decide to do in the long run? I don't know, and I don't think they know either.
---
I do enjoy buffing random passers-by.
---
Though I'm also kind of a dick, and may give you Blessing of Light or some shit if I'm feeling like it. It's only 5 minutes, so it's not like it really matters.
---
Changes and improvements definitely erode identity and server community and other aspects of the gaming experience in many ways people cannot predict. But it's also true that there was no instruction manual for doing this. For keeping an MMO at the level of popularity that Warcraft maintained year after year after year. It had never been done before and with each expansion and each patch and each quality of life or server identity alteration, blizzard was writing the book. They were dealing with old fans getting burned out and new fans joining the game and the inevitable fact that overtime players required more incentive to keep coming back, they required more rewards more often and more single player options for endgame content, as well as more ways for individual players to see endgame raid content. That began to alter perceived values of achievements and gear drops and shifted the balance of effort to reward with each expansion.
---
The way blizzard did it, there was no right way and there was no wrong way, there was and continues to be the way they do it. I'm sure they will try to recreate classic as Faithfully to the original as possible while keeping in mind certain quality of life changes that do not erode server identity and player driven communities.
---
But at the same time, if these are truly going to be progression servers which it's the obvious direction to take, they know and we know, everyone knows, where we are headed. They know what their favorite expansions were and they know what things altered their experience. Classic re-release is just another chapter in blizzards how to do an MMO long-term book.
---
I LOVED Wrath. The music and feel of Northrend was perfect. Not saying I loved all the changes, but I just enjoyed questing there so much...
---
I see you, dreamer
---
Buff player that's 4 minutes away from their destination.
---
1 minute of Kings.
---
:P
---
That’s literally false.
---
I’m guessing you never played TBC or Wrath where Zones were blocked off if you didn’t have flying.
---
The question is, when does Actiblizz decide that running classic is more expensive than it's worth? Especially since they're bundling it all under one sub? 100,000 players? 10,000? Classic is going to boom at first with people who joined during/after Cataclysm but it's a completely different game than retail and I honestly don't see it maintaining over 500,000 concurrent players indefinitely.
---
Salvation on the pet and Light on the Hunter.
---
It is not easy to feel in control of your environment when starting out in Vanilla.  This is the hallmark of a game that will eventually be rewarding.
---
Honestly alliance just seems better to you because it's what you started with and are used to.
---
I always played horde and preferred it because it's what I started with, but once I played more alliance it got closer to 50/50 to the point that I don't care it's just wherever I have friends that are going to be active.
---
I will say from a flavor standpoint I find horde a looot more interesting. Although I'm not a huge lore guy and it doesn't really affect my enjoyment too much either way.
---
I really hope I get lucky again and find a Savory Deviate Delight recipe early. I lived and breathed those fish, having gotten the recipe at level 14 right after launch. The droprate was so abysmally low back then compared to the candy it is now... I'd always have 2-3 stacks of savory deviates in my bags for maximum pirate.
---
I'm in a similar boat.
---
I want to play PvE Alliance and my friends want to play PvP Horde. I've never played Horde, so the nostalgia factor isn't there. Taurens are almost as cool as dwarves, but I was planning to play a paladin or a priest, so that's unfortunate. I figure I can avoid most of the PvP aspects.
---
The thing I'll remember most is figuring out the right AI buff to give to lowbies since you can't use max ranks on them. I eventually got good at memorizing it, but I'd scroll through my ranks clicking each one in line until one worked.
---
Simply read "Warcraft: Lord of the Clans". Will be hard to justify being on the side that opposes Thrall.
---
Same with Karazhan
---
Almost never got thanked though, or have them follow through with a buff of their own. I swear this game feels pretty antisocial now.
---
I will follow.....as long as it needs...Light be with you, friendo
---
I will follow....as long as I need to...Light be with you, friendo
---
Questionable popularity sub opinion, for many people who's favored expansion was Wrath, a large part of the reason that it was Wrath was because they played through classic and they played from burning Crusade and they brought the characters along than that journey and that time investment of those characters helped to make wrath a more enjoyable experience.
---
You mean how they stuck a few max level areas on top of cliffs where you wouldn't be going to while leveling anyways.  They could have all those places on ground level and it wouldn't make a difference gameplay-wise.
---
[fish boss trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19947) for a bit easier gearing options. 4 piece is +5% taunt, trinket is +10%
---
Arguably warrior shoulders for tanking in phase 1, but the actual bis is an epic world drop, so yeah
---
I somehow tend to toll hunters, warriors, rogues and maybe warlocks.. Id still like to buff someone, so I hand out armor kits.
---
We're not talking about pservers. Of course there's a lot more trashy people with loose morals on pirate servers who would ninja.
---
Alternate universe wow, after they bring out tbc and wrath (and during them) they start making new addons which keep the vanilla philosophies. We call it.. Wow2
---
I think this sub is def an echo chamber. I was also wondering about marketing and how hard they’ll “push” it. It may be a legit fan service where they have like 50-200k die hard subs when the novelty is gone and make a bit of coin and a lot of nerds happy for years to come 😃
---
Why PvP? Paladins? Is that why horde got better racials? Not to discredit escape artist or stoneform.
---
&gt;fall off hard after AQ in both PvE and PvP
---
Wrong, they still very strong in PvP.
---
On top of that, in order to copy your character to the TBC server, you’ll have to purchase their realm transfer. They gotta get that additional money somehow. lol
---
I think at best they’ll get people to download the Bnet launcher again and hopefully they’ll end up clicking on a different game. That’s the best case scenario for Blizzard. $15 ain’t shit.
---
This would be awesome. Roll out something new at an exrre slow pace
---
Isnt all the theories about july?
---
People know how to do math now, hence the shift.
---
And now they don’t want to do that, and want to force people to stay on the ground so we move slower and do things slower. Practically everything since WoD that they’ve introduced has been something to slow us down or make us spend more time for less rewards. M+ WAS an exception but the current M+ is shittier than legions and became tedious and annoying thanks to several decisions and dungeons.
---
It’s only a mistake because they wanted an easy way to time gate which removing flying does. Shit like Timeless isles was fine. Hell I bet they will never bring it up again because pathfinder is exactly what they want. Keep it from us till the expansion is almost over than give it to us when there’s nothing to do besides go to the new area that has no flying, so that they can slow us down in there too. 
---
Also another reason they DID design with flying in mind: Buildings and terrain couldn’t have holes anymore. Classic and TBC racial zones all had openings that you could see through and fall through. You can’t do that with flying.
---
But if they remove flying they get to time gate AND be lazy on terrain. They didn’t want to remove it for our benefit.

---
I don't see the issue with having an ending in a game. Why exactly does Classic WoW have to go on / Why do you think a game has to be played for your entire lifetime?  
---
If I "beat" the game, I'll just move on and that's it. People are trying to make having an actual endgame look like it's a bad thing when it'S not.
---
So let's do it like a Druid in the General Channel....
---
I super disagree. TBC is much closer to classic than retail in most regards.
---
Hands down favourite leveling zone due to the abundance of pvp and great zone layout to suit it
---
On a bit of a serious note I'd like it to be a straight up hard restart after like 6 to 8 months of it being out  and then one more time after that, then u would have chance to roll as each main role. Healer, tank, dps
---
No you have definitely not lost your touch. That was great!
---
They're basically nothing in common.
---
Vanilla is a Lighter, Softer EverQuest era game, while retail is a bastardized American attempt to create a Korean MMO.
---
Yeah Paladins. They're too strong in group pvp.
---
Frost mage is love.
---
Wrong, end game they are very weak in pvp.
---
The hills in Westfall are great grinding spots full of defias pirates.
---
We are! I was over there live and it’s like an End of the World party! Amazing.
---
I will of course play many games on and off as I play WoW classic on and off, I never mentioned rushing.
---
Like i said, I'm going to be playing WoW classic for a long time. ^_^
---
For the love of Elune, stop using horrible shit memes.
---
ok, I just woke up, and have to do the morning things, but in a few hours I will write a detailed reply at work
---
I remember hunter accidentally pulling shit all throughout vanilla, kind of funny with pet agro and auto attacking lol. Hunters are basically a meme class. Not as bad as ret. But if you want to do numbers and compete in dps just roll a dps class. You should give yourself a remindme
---
RemindMe! 365 days "This is how ignorant I was"
---
Why not just roll alts or change specs? Only difference you'd have is the initial rush to be geared before everyone else, which is only a small margin of the playerbase to begin with.
---
Being completely realistic - something like this would just kill the playerbase, I would assume the vast majority like myself wouldn't want to "waste" their time working hard on a character that is just going to be wiped.
---
I’ll be experiencing it live on the 14th.
---
I cant sleep! And I have to work in the mornings godamnit.
---
It was always a mix of weird feelings to replacing epics with greens to omg this new place is so cool I must explore *everything* for me.

Nythendra was the easiest boss in WoW if you exclude MC. Change my mind.
---
&gt;It will 100% eclipse Fortnite in its first week or maybe even more.  
---
oh my sweet summer child...
---
Im gonna. Stay levle 35 forever and gank.
---
Standing on the Auberdine bridge waiting for the boat and watching the heavy rain storm roll by.
---
What would be the best? Hunter?
---
You're god damn right.
---
True those were fun, but then when does it stop? I guess if you took it that far you would have to keep re-creating and doing the same 3  over and over. I think they would need to expand classic and not worry about the current expansions, cut that's just me
---
Hello there :) 
---
... I'm in similar situation as you ... played from classic to pandaria and rest of it I mostly know from videos ... yea am 34 as well ... and I did lvl character to lvl 20 a month ago ... it was garbage ... the game is different right from the start ... it is like playing in a nightmare ... dark parody ... trust me it's not worth playing ... if you want to do something badly try pserver but I would also tell you to not do it ... I guess you want this hard nostalgic kick ... you want to play the game which actually is a good one and which offers real challenge mixed with great story ... and if you start now on pserver you won't have it when classic starts ... you didn't play on pserver earlier, why start now ? :) 
---
Wait ... and ... Ilidian had been waiting for ten thousand years ... you can wait few more weeks :P
---
Oh my god. I'm speechless
---
&gt;You know that internet forums and boards are made for discussion right?
---
You are not here for discussion.
---
You are here for confirmation. All you want to hear is "Oh what a great and interesting idea. you are so smart. here have an upvooooote".
---
You cannot deal with people challenging your opinion, and thus accuse them of being "vile", same as a certain orange clown does all the time.
---
**It won't be on console, and there is nothing you can do about that. Case closed.**
---
I miss set bonuses
---
Right
---
Man your making me excited and i’m already rolling Horde lol.
---
Yeah Paladins are the easiest, just stay on top of your assigned buff and heal but, if I were to go healer I would rock a troll priest 100%
---
What do you mean, lol? It was the first version of WoW, you think we all came from the future with 10 years of experience before started?
---
People stop playing. Less supply. More demand. Prices skyrocket as items become exceedingly rare.
---
Yess!
---
I know right lol
---
Do you not understand what the RP in MMORPG is for? Never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons?
---
Nothing. If you want progression people will go back to retail WoW
---
There will be a limited time event where you fight a half gron half Draenei named tharnos who is trying to collect the unlimity crystals and steal everyone’s nostalgia
---
so you get a feral druid or some fury warriors to put on a shield for everyone but mograine, it's not as huge of a hurdle as you think. You don't think people actually had 8 fully geared prot warriors for every 4hm kill?
---
Too late. Was I not supposed to do that?
---
No.
---
That's the dream for some specs. If they are going to release new comment I'm hoping they do class balance patches as well.
---
Damn that shaman most have been weak
---
In the beginning, I was confused too about the size of the Classic world and the overwhelming lore. I had a hard time to feel some immersion. 
---
Playing the campaigns of Warcraft 3 fixed it for me. It's highly scenarized and you'll get usefull references about major characters, places , events, etc. If you're new to Warcraft it's a great way to step (the best imo). The sense of going on an adventure and the social importance have no equal. 
---
Retail is a bit more complicated to get into lore-wise, as the plot began 4 expansions ago, you'll have to get interested and read some wikis I guess. You'll have no difficulty playing alone until very late game content (mythic+ dungeons, normal+ raids and pvp). It's overall way easier.
---
Nah, I’m good.
---
Spend as much time getting it right - and then release it.
---
It’s been 3 years of waiting - I can spend a few extra months waiting for it.
---
&gt; Flying changed the social meta instantly
---
*hwat*
---
the anger is strong
---
No thanks, still cooling off my burn out in preparation for the real thing
---
&gt;Change my mind.
---
People who say that don't want their mind changed, they want confirmation, confrontation, and will never even consider changing their predetermined point of view.
---
So no thanks. If I wanted to waste my time, I would listen to a tree growing.
---
Just a public server reminder..........Dungeon queues are a thing.
---
Meeting Stones can be used to create a queue for that dungeon OR you can just talk to any inn-keeper to queue up.
---
PS's don't have this system since it was removed when TBC came out and they're built on a TBC core, so server side stuff from vanilla doesn't exist, and had to remade from scratch.
---
Now the reason a lot of people don't remember them is because their earlier sucked ass.
---
Though by the end of vanilla they'd pretty much fixed them and made them fairly convient to use, but the damage was already done.
---
I'm curious to see if this new dungeon finder generation would be more willing to use the system as it was intended.
---
But since all private server meeting stones function as their TBC versions (summoning stones), there's no real data to see if they would get used more often.
---
But people have no problems using the TBC or Wrath versions, so...It might be a thing. (The TBC group finder works more like the Custom Group finder of modern retail, except much less bells and whistles, and not X-server).
---
World Boss were generally guild only affairs since they'd usually be killed within a few hours of spawning, unless your server simply lacked any guilds large enough to consistently get enough people to kill them. Then you might see a Pug.
---
Also keep in mind that World Bosses die when they are killed (obvious right) and don't respawn until the weekly reset.
---
So only one raid per week can actually kill them.
---
The tolerance for bullshit is low.
---
I started WoW in March of '06. 10,000 days came out April '06, so I expect classic in July.
---
You're right there is no roadmap for where WoW was or is going. And agreed, the QoL changes have so far been very tastefully done. But I do think it's telling that there is a demand to go all the way back to vanilla, not even one expansion in, and it would be overlooking a lot to simply chalk that up to misplaced nostalgia.
---
It's a return to a different game design philosophy that recognizes how inconvenience can contribute to a more impactful world. Pvping for limited resource nodes (it's own "steal the bacon" brand fun) comes to mind. Raids were not memorable because they were super hard, but because you had skin in the game.
---
In the end I hope this project isnt just a straight progression project, but one that maybe explores other avenues of content while maintaining the same design philosophies. Or maybe no new content at all. Vanilla pservers have existed for almost 10 years, that should speak to the game's sustainability.
---
It would be cool to have a sort of Caverns of Time event happen, where you can enter in and either experience TBC or just the raids. If you are back on Azeroth you only appear as your level 60 Classic self. For those who want to move on they can and go back and forth between worlds. But when they are in Azeroth it's as if they never really left.
---
Glad you've got to experience it enough to be burnt out.
---
Basically what happens is that people acquire overall too much gold so there is an inflation on the market. You might see stuff like Greater Magic Wand being 1g on the AH while it would be something around 15-35s on the fresh server. 
---
That means the only people that will be able to afford these things are people that already have a character and are only needing such items for their alts = the market will be unavailable? for possible new players.
---
Same with consumables. How do you persuade someone who already achieved everything in the game to continue farming stuff? He will be asking for more gold which again screws casual ppl/new ppl.
---
So basically gold will lose its value meaning everything will be going up and up in price.
---
I just recently getting interested in classic WoW and this was the first question I had, so a "No one knows" in a sticky or sidebar would probably be helpful to a whole bunch of incoming people
---
https://i.imgur.com/buX1q32.gif
---
&gt;There's no money in making things past wotlk.
---
That's a bold claim.
---
Pretentious much? It's a meme bro. I really do think that Nythendra was the easiest boss post-MC though, even Mythic Nythendra was laughable.
---
I came
---
But one can only call it inconvenience after having gone through the process of experiencing the evolving convenience of future expansions.
---
Does just sitting down increase your health regeneration in classic?
---
He could have gone to STV on a different character with a different race.
---
Hillsbrad is good but it’s so susceptible to being ganked since alliance quest there at higher level than horde do. It’s also crowded due to a lot of the mobs involve quests
---
I was just thinking this, I have a wife and son who’s 1, so to me it doesn’t matter when the game comes out or how much vacation I take I’ll still only be able to play after bed time for a few hours. But, I’ll have fun doing it and enjoy my experience. Although I do see myself “accidentally” pulling an all nighter and being a zombie at scho.. I mean work :I
---
Please, this is Warcraft. We should be using broken Latin.
---
Veni*
---
More like, trying to choose your race/class before launch...lol
---
For what it's worth - fury warriors are the strongest dps in 1.12 so you probably don't want to lump them in with meleeshamans.
---
60 cap forever, gear tiers are only incrementally better after t2 but raids are clutch level hard after naxx. There's plenty of vanilla lore to add content in EXISTING areas. Shoot, have the entrance to the Emerald Dream be in wailing caverns or Mara
---
Hey guys, 
---
Getting an invalid invite for your discord link!
---
The people answering this poll are much more likely than the general playerbase to be hardcore raiders.
---
In PvE the benefits of sword/mace spec are huge. If people are min-maxing super hard they aren't going to pass up 2-3% increased DPS or threat for escape artist.
---
When the game finally comes out you're going to see way more of the casual players or PvPers rolling other class/race combos.
---
If that happens, I’ll almost be obligated to play classic.
---
Tempel of Hakkar of what it’s called still gives me nightmares. I just hate this place. Mostly because you had no dungeon map back then and it was super confusing. 
---
Zul Farrak probably one of my most favorites, together with Monestary Library and Deadmines/SFK.
---
Definitely annoyed... but honestly it might actually weed out people too, that would be a detriment. 
---
Leveling to 60 on another server sucks,  but I wouldn't pay to transfer
---
This company is dumb as shit,  but until we break up the gaming industry,  we're kind of fucked
---
Precisely.
---
This is the best option.
---
The beginning is genius at least.
---
Blizzard has said that they don't care how many play Classic. They will continue hosting servers and supporting the game. Classic is not about a second chance at making WoW great again. It is about preserving a historic game. Private servers have been popular for many years. How have they solved the question of "new" content? By adding fresh servers. Once you start adding new content to Classic it is no longer Classic.
---
If you liked tbc you'll definitely like vanilla. You'll find a way
---
I don't think that's true, we knew how inconvenient the 50g respects costs were for sure LOL.
---
But more seriously yeah, I see your point. That's what this whole thread was about, though we cheered the changes at the time few saw how it could be making some aspects of the game worse. I guess it turns out that for myself, those were the most important parts.
---
* If this ends up being a progression project I'm gonna fuckin start the Vanilla WoW 2.0 movement
---
Keep in mind that they're already developed all these porting tools for 1.12, which is exactly one patch away from TBC. I can't imagine that they didn't plan ahead and work some flexibility into the tooling to allow for easy porting of further content. I'd agree that it absolutely makes the most sense that they would release TBC. After already spending the money to develop all the tools for classic, it would be an easy win to move ahead and use the tooling to port more content that they already have.
---
You don’t seem so sure
---
I'd personally play up through MoP again, although I'd take a break for the latter 2 tiers of Cata.
---
What else would it be? Servers that go to the end of vanilla content and then stay there Frozen at the end? Servers that regularly refresh and wipe progress every 15 to 18 months? Servers that move passed naxxramas and going to completely new content? That sounds like the kind I think that blizzard could charge expansion type dollars for.
---
The public is terrible at game design. OSRS is a great example of why no dev should ever go that route, although no sane dev actually would consider it in the first place. Just look at the revs release, where the community was onboard with new content but voted down any actual rewards for it, leaving them to fill the drop tables with random alchables.
---
This not working on pservers is honestly their most tragic flaw.
---
10000 days?
---
Lmao yikes
---
More to the point, if blizzard did continue the content after vanilla but created different content that was not burning Crusade, clearly yourself and other people who might approve of this would approve of it with the idea that certain things that did get changed in burning Crusade or in future expansions might possibly not get changed or stay as they were in classic for a little while longer. There were things that you did not like about burning Crusade or wrath or cataclysm that, using this new post classic game content model, might turn out differently? That they may never introduce flying?
---
The last Album released by Tool.
---
Hell yeah man! One of my plans are 2p shadow and 2p wildheart for that +400 armor, good for both pvp and some tankin'
---
Ohhh ok. Gotcha lol
---
Depends when he joined in TBC. If it was before the paladin tank buff patch, then yes, it will be similar to that. If he started after, then it's hard to tell. The game dramatically changed on that day.
---
They could pull a RuneScape and just add new areas/quests/raids/skills. I could see them maybe pulling over some BC raids adjusted for level 60s
---
I just want to play a game again, where I can watch some shows or YouTube meanwhile when. I friends are playing. Just chilling and playing.
---
Hasn’t it only been a year and a half of waiting?
---
That's one thing Retail finally got kind of right again this expansion
---
Nice, but... you left the seat up
---
Why
---
It's massive. A semi-casual guild shouldnt matter, but it's similar to dwarf priests. If you roll a night elf priest, guilds will still take you, but you'll have to fend off lots of people telling you you really should be a dwarf.
---
Gnome is, sadly, objectively inferior in pve to Humans as a DPS warrior provided you are using swords/maces, by about 5% (i think the 7-10 mentioned by hot slice below is a little high, but weapon skill is HUGE in pve due to how it reduces Glancing Blow damage on boss level enemies, something that doesnt factor into PvP).
---
Gnome is also objectively inferior as a tank to Humans (due to threat) and Dwarves/NElves (due to survivability racials), and brings basically nothing to the table. +5% Int is useless for warriors, engineering bonus is semi handy but generally only affects the damage an arcanite dragonling does at 60, and escape artist is very meh for pve - situational use but nothing compared to stone form.
---
That said, lots of guilds wont care, and should accept you, its only the super hardcore minmaxy ones that will frown on Gnome warriors. You can always try and spin it positively - as you arent human you can happily mop up all the unwanted Axes and Daggers that drop that wont benefit their weaponskill, which leads to the raid being geared a bit quicker.
---
For horde there are all the sickly peasant dudes at the southern end of silvermine forest by the wall. There's even a handy vendor right there. Theres another spot in ashenvale at lower levels that I have never seen on any guide or list. The timbermaw den watchers and shamans in the old troll cave you go into for troll relics. Theres a polar bear escort quest in that cave system as well, but the upper level are barely touched and were quite profitable as well since they have a high drop of the pages
---
I just think it would be cool to also have progression servers. Whether its based on vote or not. But the only “changes” should just be moving onto the next patch in vanilla / whatever xpac the server is on.
---
I feel bad when I get a fort or AI on my warlock and can just put an unending breath on them
---
Upvoted
---
agreed, gnome warrior is a perfectly good choice for PvP, and may even be the best pvp choice depending on matchup. Sadly though it's objectively the worst choice for PvE for both tanking and dps, which is where its unpopularity lies.
---
Who is arguing that? Most of the player base up to wotlk started in TBC and wotlk. They didnt play vanilla.
---
I would think if there was a crowd for TBC or wotlk they would be heard a little more. But there is a very small community for both, because it's not what people want. They want classic. For 14 years people have been playing classic. Speculation in these changes are hearsay. Fresh servers seem to be what people are after. Easier to toss up 2.
---
So you're problem with the PVP server is that PVP happens. 
---
You realize it's a war in the lore right?
---
I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was the day we started to run into every dungeon and AoE pull everything. People were super excited about the change. Literally the day before, you still had to have very strict crowd control assignments on any pull above like 3-4 mobs. Vanilla tanks had literally zero AoE tanking abilities. I played from Vanilla all the way to Pandas, and that day was the day the game changed the most in my opinion.
---
could you click them off in vanilla? I do not remember
---
For you.
---
This is pretty obvious what they're planning to do.  
---
  Most modern engine, ported from legion to bfa recently, the patch number, classic started development after OSRS success, etc.   
---
  The fact they're so tight lipped about this is, if anything, just further confirmation they're very actively thinking about it, depending on classic success.
---
Good rule of thumb:  if your reason for the change is Quality of Life the answer is NO.
---
No, you're correct. Flying is such a cool mechanic and flying mounts consistent of some of the coolest mounts (maybe because of their importance that most mounts seem to fly). 
---
*italics*But*italics*, I also agree that flying mounts don't have a place in the Classic experience. You don't deserve the flack for what you said.
---
It wasn't for a while, until this expansion
---
This website is wrong at least for fury warrior
---
Typical troglodyte response. Point is  with that attitude why should i care that the other party member needs it, they can use the gold to buy a weapon from the Ah and we all need gold ehh?
---
well, you started with a strong sun picture...
---
ReTaIl bAd VaNiLlA gOoD
---
Definitely wait until Classic release. It may be a little crazy, especially during the first month or so, but this game starts you out small. It's a little slow, and figuring out where to go and what to do can be somewhat tedious.  
---
A lot of the game is not very intuitive during the first 20 levels, it's mostly "go here and deliver this" or "find my lost XXXXX" or "kill 96 Octopus" type stuff. Kinda boring, but every zone ALSO has those "hey, this is our problem, and we need your help" - these quests almost always provide some of the lore and stories the game is built on.  
---
For instance, if you go to Westfall (usually around lvl 12-14), you'll start a quest chain killing a band of rebels named "The Defias" - the more you do, the more in-depth you go. And eventually you find yourself neck deep in one of the deepest stories behind what is going on in the kingdom of Stormwind (the human capital) - and you've only just begun to play the game!  
---
There's so much to explore and enjoy, with most zones telling a story or offering a unique challenge. It's an experience all in and of itself! So don't fall prey to "quick leveling strategies" or "min/max your XXXX" stuff.  
---
That's not to say you shouldn't study and prep a little - such as knowing what class/faction/race you want to play. But the key is (and this is what modern MMORPG's miss) that you can have fun just exploring the environment!  
---
It's an amazing experience, with incredible challenges, that sap away at your time as the only penalty for making mistakes - a payment we all gladly make, because when the moment comes that we achieve our next goal, the feeling of accomplishment and success makes it all worth it!
---
I cannot see why blizzard cant release a list, releasing it would allow them to get an estimate of where players intend on crowding which is valueable information to them in order to balance things.
---
Used to keep an extra set of gear that, when not actually doing content, I'd throw on nust for the looks. This is definitely one of those! Haha
---
Vote on a council reference Eve, have them hold votes and oversee shit.  Probably would fail to but just a thought.
---
Flying mounts really only work in MMO's if they were intended from the start.
---
Right? After you’re in BiS, you help others get BiS. Honestly, only a small percentage of the player base will be ready for a new phase the moment it rolls out. Most players will still be farming MC when BWL drops, etc. there weren’t any shortcuts to last tier gear in vanilla, so there will always be players looking for guidance through older raids.
---
It’s the same graphics engine. Classic will be the game but it runs on the modern client and servers. 
---
And older graphics engine would be extremely expensive, using the same client as retail saves money.
---
Glorified q-hub action game simulator (it’s not an MMO m8)
---
Quit being so pathetic it's honestly kinda sad.  Every time you post on here it's a complaint and its just so damn obvious that you're seething.
---
On the other hand, Vanilla was just as much defined by how it changed over time as it was by the content it had. A WoW that never changes? That also loses part of what made WoW WoW.
---
Quit being so pathetic it's honestly kinda sad. Every time you post on here it's a complaint and its just so damn obvious that you're seething.
---
Try both. I think it's a lot about personal taste. Classic feels more of old school MMORPG where current live is more action adventure game. They are very different games despite both being WoW.
---
You still have opportunities to really help someone out. If you're passing by areas with mobs and get in range of some players farming, BoW/BoM are super powerful buffs.
---
You guys act like you can't RP on a pvp server.
---
There was 3 posts that I saw from today in my 5 minutes of scrolling earlier.
---
sad
---
I'm pretty sure Blizz said they want Vanilla servers to run forever.
---
I can't buff you, but if you're dying I'll send my pet to taunt.
---
&gt;I honestly have no idea-just my 2 cents.
---
Then why not just save those 2 cents and stay quiet if you have no idea?
---
There's a macro that checks your target's level and casts the appropriate rank, it's so useful in those scenarios. I'm definitely going to get it once Classic's macro system details are out.
---
Please. Just stop.
---
I thought it would be cool if Outland zones were Elite zones, with the majority of the content designed to be done in a group. The demons we meet on the other side of the portal should probably be stronger than the ones we fight in the Blasted Lands.
---
I don't wanna here any complaints. It's a stupidly easy quest and you even get the strongest travel form for 10 levels at the same time. Funny that.
---
And interestingly, enough, it follows the path you should be taking as a horde character at level 20.
---
All in all it's a very well designed quest that like every other level 20 class quest, was meant to be done over-time. Which also why the first water totem sucks. No rush.
---
I would pay expansion money for classic-style horizontal content, sure.
---
TBC had some good ideas (I'm particularly fond of arenas). But for me it was the beginning of the end. Especially daily quests. And all the old content being rendered irrelevant. Some other stuff too but I'm probably off base. Flying had implementation problems but I didnt altogether hate the idea until I heard they brought it to Azeroth some time later.
---
In any case I don't know how to make new content while staying within this admittedly vague lane, or where we should draw the line. But I can say I'm impressed so far and think the classic team really does "get it". They're making the right changes in the right places, and a few years down the road I could definitely see myself buying a horizontal classic style expansion.
---
Poor chizz lol
---
Every night before I go to bed I pray they take the OSRS route.
---
Or the 4 great big portals to the Emerald Dream.
---
It depends on the racials, but basically you have to use and abuse the sap+cheapshot macro for dueling. 
---
This allows you to gain combo points and even expose armor for reopening on the target. 
---
Warlocks you can try to sap and kill the succy   or just go full force and try to vanish the deathcoil for an easy win. If you're orc it gets complicated if you aren't able to,  but sprinting and reopening between the dots should be doable and basically the lock is dead usually. Then you just gotta survive the dots....
---
Same for shadowpriest. The damage reduction sucks,  but if you get good at resetting yourself into stealth it's gonna help with all classes.
---
You're not going to beat a good Paladin.... it's just a stupid fight.
---
Warrior you can bleed kite but it's pretty boring imo. 
---
Mage: You just have to be ready.  Pretty much have to be ready to trinket and multiple vanishes in case they cold snap. Timing of gouges can really hurt a mage. Ice block twice... so yeah.. it's not always easy.
---
If they POM sheep you as a fire mage you could get 2 shot...
---
Being a rogue isn't dominating,  but we have a shit ton of tricks to get the job done or escape
---
That's how i play all mmo's hold that right  click in and steer/free run lol
---
Except heroin
---
for sure, it's different for everyone. likewise, I know as xpacs went along, things changed that I didn't really care for...but by that point, my sense of 'these are MY characters, this investment of time and effort means something to ME, and it's enough to keep me playing and enjoying it despite these new things I don't like'
---
as expected, that feeling happened right around the end of wrath/getting cataclysm news, namely when achievements were introduced and my completionist alter-ego was given some truly mind boggling tasks to work towards'
---
My guess would be played later xpacs where early zones were needed, then tried a vanilla server for the first time.
---
The last 25% to get rank 10 is no joke without a premade, we're talking around 30 hours in 1 week.
---
&gt; ...seeing a bunch of night elves hugging a tree... 
---
This would only be appealing to me if I had an orc rogue named "Paulbunyan" in a guild named "Lumber Liquidators"
---
I do like how you used a numbered format to look like you're not making wide assumptions and exadurations to seem like your opinions are somehow facts. Keep doing you kitten.
---
Na, if you're unable to tolerate hypothetical discussions then I'm incapable of catering to your incredulous attitude.
---
Here’s the thing. 07scape team barely made new content. All they did was pick and choose RS3 content which they deemed fit for OSRS.
---
Have a look :https://i.redd.it/hlbezsx0w6i21.png
---
The OSRS route does not mean ‘let devs create new post endgame content’. It means letting TBC release minus the flying. It means letting WOTLK release minus the LFD.
---
And to be fair, that might just be the best route.
---
That's a major issue with classic vs retail vanilla, I wonder if we'll have permanent Azuregos ghost like there are on private servers. It'd make AQ opening event much harder if all the people doing the scepter quest had to be around when Azuregos is killed.
---
And only individual guilds going to kill world bosses, huh. That'll be a big change from private servers.
---
Ok bud, there are like 20 of these posts a day and none of them lead to productive discussion.  So take a hint.
---
Yeah lol I had it!!
---
&gt; what happened in WoD erased the first three Warcraft (not world of warcraft but the rts') from the timeline and canon.
---
Did it? I thought it left the Warcraft lore pretty intact. WoD was an alternate reality so anything that happened in it would have no impact on preexisting lore.
---
If they give different playable races one day in a hypothetical progressed beyond vanilla type server I want the fucking walrus people from wotlk.
---
Nope. They specifically stated PVP servers and will see how populated things become.
---
Finally some logic in this thread
---
Making your way to ZF through dust storms in Tanaris.
---
Or just dont be a nozzle on 20 posts a day? How dare anyone talk about anything you dont want.
---
&gt;For ONCE can't we just have a game that isn't constantly changing, that we can come back to time and time again and have it still be the same game we know and love? Is that so much to ask?
---
But we aren't even getting that with classic. We're getting phases that move the goal posts. Luckily we didn't end up with progressive itemisation.
---
You're listing parts of the broken isles.
---
I don't read every post but I've never seen any discussion on classes or races. So unless you're aware of another thread with discussion on this topic, rather than the topic of changes in general. then I'm just going to continue to discuss it here. You're welcome to not participate.
---
well actually, retail wow is about 20% smaller than Vanilla is. During the Cata revamp they shrunk the entire world to keep relative size the same despite new zones.
---
it's really east to compare if you go to the Human starter zone. It feels cramped since the buildings are mostly the same size, but the rest of the zone has shrunk about 20%, where as the vanilla version feels huge as there's more space relative to the building size.
---
Exploring the world during the Cata pre-patch actually made my head-hurt due to the disconnect between muscle memory of how many steps to this or that, and the reality of it. It didn't feel right at all.
---
it was only later they revealed that during the zone redesign a lot of zones were shrunk to improve performance despite the higher level of detail.
---
Vanilla+ please. Give me TBC talent trees in Vanilla and I will die happy.
---
Imagine having a portal to the emerald dream in wailing caverns that only spawns after you complete the escort quest. How annoying would that be.
---
That would be weird and interesting. How would that work, would they be modeled similarly to dwarves, but fatter and with tusks?
---
Yes.
---
A minority of people complained about dungeon difficulty and Blizz obliged and nerfed the content, sub numbers dropped as a result. Sad to see those two tiers wasted...
---
Hey bud!
---
Sorry that must be a bloody one dayer. 
---
Here's a permanent invite! I'll edit the post too. Thanks for letting me know!!
---
https://discord.gg/yaRWuJm
---
Fair to note by the way that 07scape is starting to become overly polished with all the QoL updates it's receiving. Classic WoWers are going to have to look out for this. If it happens to 07scape, it can easily happen to classic wow.
---
Lol no
---
I've leveled 6 warriors in the last 12 months. Pre level 24 is mail. No plate in question. I never said it instantly kills you, it sets you up for death. And a little more unlucky and you are dead.
---
But then what was the point of the water walking mount, or giving a class water-walking as an ability?
---
Yes, it can also take the raid longer to complete. That's my point
---
Yes
---
Classic wow is the only wow worth playing. It was made in 2004-2006. Back then the internet was not so huge, there was no youtube, no micro/macro transactions and blizzard wasn't rotten to the core. It was an mmorpg before all of the internet bullshit that came later. It was an online game molded from the most hardcore mmorpgs to be more casual friendly (based on the standards of 2004), but if you look at it from the 2019 perspective it is the perfect blend of  not too easy, but not too hard either. WoW classic was never truly hardcore mmo, but it is absolutely not a baby easy mode(like modern wow).
---
I just want 2 fucking specs so I can pvp and raid and not literally spend 100s of gold every two weeks. 
---
That is literally the only change I think isn't bad. 
---
Or just cap respeccing a little cheaper
---
I'm not a gold farmer,  I like to raid and pvp
---
It takes longer to reach 60 in vanilla than 120 in retail.
---
Not in classic.
---
I'm fully aware of that, I don't know why you're telling me that. I said 4HM is more iconic because it was seen as the guild breaker back then, I've heard plenty of stories about how guilds were poaching tanks in order to have 8 tanks with 4-pc T3.
---
Obviously people know better now, with the ZG trinket and not really needing fully dedicated prot tanks for the other 3 horsemen aside from Mograine.
---
Doesn't change the fact that 4HM is a ridiculously unforgiving fight, and that it only takes 1-2 players fucking up in order to get a domino effect that leads to a wipe or a straight up wipe. Still not as hard as KT though. KT is even worse on that aspect.
---
If RpPvP servers are available I will play there all though I'm only a moderate Rper. Rp servers in general will be more lax, less competitive and it's more about enjoying the game and immersion.
---
Also just seeing some other players Rp adds a whole lot of immersion to the game. 
---
Also Blizz. ADD F\*\*\*ing RpPvP realms.
---
true but every class besides mage and rogues fall of hard here.
---
I think it would be awesome if at the 'end' of the phases, they opened the next expansion--in this case TBC--and allowed you to transfer your characters into it and treat it the same with phases leading into the expansion after that etc. All voluntary so you can choose to relive each expansion.
---
Probably. Underwater breathing, better fishing skill, frost resistance, maybe a 3min cd healthpool shield similar to the temporary hp trinkets and the dwarf stoneform combined. Really high stamina and intellect, piss low agility, average spirit and strength.  Changable tusks and skin color kinda like trolls and dwarfs combined.
---
I did a rp-pvp server in TBC. I didn't notice much to going on because I was always doing shit with my guild, who didn't rp.
---
Wrath may have *been* the peak but TBC was what got the game *to* the peak.
---
It was added in like the very next mini-patch of 1.9 (1.9.1), so his ghost will be available during Phase 5 automatically, since Phase 5 is 1.9 and 1.10 content.
---
seriously? I'm definitely checking this out, once classic launches
---
... fire mages who have the ignite debuff deals alot of dmg, yes. 
---
The rest wont break 1k dps over longer fights.
---
I want to max out every class BiS. ...
---
But then I will camp noobs, hunt insane rep grinds and titles, hunt mounts. ...
---
Then I will do every quest in the game both horde and ally 
---
..
---
Then.......I will make lots of friends and do lots of silly fun events the possibilities are endless wow you can just walk around and do nothing but it feels like you're doing something. After all this It will be like a good amount of time. Then maybe they bring out new vanilla raids which are 40 man raids or even heroic raids for all the classic raids.
---
That would be a bad idea, and it would cost them money to do, so no.
---
Should have tested DPS with Nightfall since that's what you'll be wielding at raids.
---
I’m not crying! You’re crying!
---
My guess is that Blizzard does something so ingeniously genius we will collectively shit our pants. Re-release every single expansion pack, basically redoing everything and re-obtaining millions of dollars in revenue. So what comes after naxx? Tbc.
---
It's just so insane it might actually happen, I'm excited
---
It had good and bad things. 
---
I miss Arena
---
Yes, those zones are the only post Pathfinder zones worse than WoD for traversal on the ground. The rest of Legion and all the BfA zones are fine on foot.
---
Anything but TBC and I'll be happy.
---
I do think their "lack of scale" is perhaps over emphasized. It's weird that people feel like whatever a class parses on average or what the top parse of a class is will be the DPS they are pulling if they play that class. In my personal experience so much of playing a class is about the player. I would rather take a hunter who can masterfully work traps, multi-task in the form of actively controlling their pet and its abilities, etc than say an average rogue or average dps warrior. Plus a hunter has the advantage of taking less damage by avoiding cleave and boss centered aoe, and having feign death. So as a healer I don't have to worry as much about healing a hunter, and the hunter doesn't have to stop their "worse" dps to run away from a mob.
---
I know the idea is comparing equally skilled players on two different classes but that just frankly is rarely the case. It's pretty hard to find two players who are exactly the same skill as players in general *and* specifically on their  respective class.
---
Ogres would need to be in this as well.
---
They've promised classic will always be playable. Hell, D2 servers are still up. I don't see them closing those servers and backpedaling on their promise ever. Unless they go out of business ofc.
---
That's not true at all. Warrior, Priest, Shaman, Warlock all shine in end game gear. It's actually Mage, Rogue, and Hunter who fall off in end game because of poor item scaling.
---
https://itemization.info/item/7713
---
Can't wait to get my ass beat trying to do the Agamand Mills quests.
---
no
---
Just having watched it again, i'm struck by the fact that the undead was obviously evil from the beginning, which stuck through vanilla.
---
Every day I think about how amazing this would be.  The day they announce tbc is the day I quit.
---
Just get rid of the easy xp leveling, lfg system, and welfare epics, then create an alternate timeline after wotlk.
---
I love the one with the dock. I miss that dock. I'd go way out to the edge and spend hours fishing off it while watching the much higher level thrashers in the water below.
---
100% agree with this.
---
Sure I know a lot of people wanted them for a while now.
---
/e has nothing to say  
---
Put that on a macro and simply hit it when they get weird. Then turn on some death metal to balance out the weird and keep on monster slayin'
---
That “huh!”-sound coupled with the sound of a fireball casting - and you just know full well that it’s gonna eat 15-20% of your health.
---
Plz no BC
---
Ah MAN, that's the coolest!! Especially when you've got a goal like that in the world that takes you so far off the beaten path.
---
tl;dr yes
---
Yep! I also have this subreddit to thank for what to expect. STV has always been a bit of a gankfest in my experience, but the screenshots here are something else. I missed the main event.
---
The equivalent of the 1 copper trade when they send you free items. I don't have anything to spare, but I care
---
Met my Mrs at Uni. She was already into games but had never played wow (i didn't know this until waay into the relationship). Introduced her to it in around MoP and she liked it. Will be re rolling together in Vanilla (8 years later).  
---
My point, don't get hung up finding a 'gamer girl'. Looking for an existing gamer girl is limiting your field, and looking for female players in game aint gonna work, you dont know location, their age, their relationship status. There just there to play a game, not hook up, you just come across as creepy. Find someone with similar interests and hobbies and who you get on with. Chances are if you share an interest you can introduce her to wow/gaming and she will like it.
---
Blizzard confirmed RP servers, but no RPPvP servers.
---
I once rolled against a rogue in TBC on dungeon set item, rogue was very upset so prepare to be hated by at least one rogue.
---
Then again you will probably lose roll to a hunter 😂
---
This is like everyone who would roll on rp-pvp. You probably won’t even see much real rp. And that’s why actual roleplayers will roll on pure RP realms instead lol.
---
This needs more praise. Well made. Got a smile out of me.
---
Played the first 5 phases serieusly.
---
Retail heroic raiding mechanics.
---
Playing alot. Really alot.
---
You're free to create your own server if none of the options available is good enough, goldilocks.
---
No need to rerender it. I'd love to see an ingame trailer.
---
I hope they dont add a new expansions tbh. I don‘t like to hurry and would like to enjoy classic at my own pace for many years
---
Can I get a link? I have their twitter saying they have no plans for PVE/RP servers, basically saying they only plan to add them based on how populated the core servers are.
---
First of all; reaching 60 in classic takes longer than reaching 120 in BfA. 
---
Second; don’t worry about players “leagues”. 9 out of 10 players are terrible. You’ll learn and you’ll do fine.
---
I doubt they'd offer transfers, you'd have to reroll.
---
Yes, it does. And creating a campfire will give you a Spirit buff, making it regen a bit faster.
---
They're pre-raid for everyone.
---
Classic is just good, period.
---
The amount of time I sat outside an instance waiting for someone to help me summon on my lock....
---
It's like all the non locks play chicken as to who will make the effort to walk to the instance.
---
Either dwarf rogue or NE druid, need that stealth.
---
I've always felt Blizzard would be wise to do the "original trilogy" servers in a way. Progression content from Vanilla-Wrath, and then cycles back to fresh Vanilla. I doubt many people would ask for Cata-Present, simply because the game got so controversial from then on, but being able to make a character on a Classic Server, raid through Vanilla, then TBC, then WotLK would be amazing. 
---
That being said, I'd also like to see Classic affect retail. Are you a Classic Scarab Lord? Grats, if you drop $25 we'll transfer your 60 over to retail, and then you can be a Scarab Lord in both. Got T3 on some classes? Great, $10 a character and that transmog is unlocked for retail. It seems ridiculous, but it's a fair way to get people earning retired cosmetics, and paying for them.
---
I used to go to IF on my undead priest and mind control people into lava.... good fucking times!!
---
I'm excited to dole out that sweet unending breath. Hope it helps guys!
---
Considering it was designed for casual players that havent played mmo's before, I think you'll be fine.
---
Yup. Been there done that. I was on a run with a guild I applied to once, where I had even transferred servers. Topped meters consistently every. single. fight. AND had the lowest damage taken. (They weren't that good, tbh). But, they were progressing and raided at a convenient time for me, which was more than I could find on my own server at the time.  
---
Then, one of the mages I was consistently outperforming, claims incessantly that I am "a shit mage" because I wasn't fire spec, which was clearly the best - even though they only beat me on one fight out of maybe 8/9 that we cleared. So they booted me. Because I played arcane, and "anybody can play arcane, that doesn't take any skill" - even though it was clearly better than what they could do, even with their "superior skill" (and better gear, too)
---

---
Maybe, maybe not. On a PvE server, you won't be quite as likely to be able to farm lvl 48-55.

I regret to inform you that not having flying does not come anywhere close to fixing retail
---
Ah thank you! Guess I'll have to survive a tips video...
---
I'm looking forward fo finding out how they're tuned. The rogue lvl 10 quest in teldrassil required some crazy shenanigans to pull off on some servers.
---
I'm going full circle. I'm going to ditch my 3440x1440 in favor of my old 21" nec crt.
---
Yes, you can "flag" for PvP by hand. (On PvP servers you just get flagged automatically in contested zones.) And then when you encounter others who also flagged it works exactly like on PvP servers. Battlegrounds also work exactly like on PvP servers.
---
Of course on a PvE server you can expect many (most?) people to not flag for PvP. So open world PvP might be less lively. But battlegrounds should be just as popular (maybe even more so).
---
The "problem" with PvP servers is that you have to adapt to the most hardcore. You can see this here with many people salivating at ganking "lowbies". You have to rush to level 60, otherwise in content phase 2 you'll be ganked mercilessly for honor points, for example. Also because in Vanilla/Classic you have to go to instances to run them, people make their job to gank opposing faction groups going to them. If you are not in a hardcore guild ready to fight them off, you can forget about raiding. And hardcore guilds will dictate what you should play, how and how much.
---
Classic WoW is where boys become men.
---
/flop
---
What is keyboard turning
---
&gt; will we just be bored as soon as we reach lv 60?
---
* That won't happen for a while. Leveling in Classic will be much slower.
---
* At 60 you can do a myriad of things to improve your character. So you are not "done" with the game.
---
&gt; I also really dont like the fact that there is no social interaction in the normal version.
---
This will be different in Classic. But beware that this also means that you can't do everything by yourself. Some quests and especially dungeons will require you to talk to people!
---
There's pally (mount q), hunter (leaf q) and priest (Benediction q) as well.
---
Non. Go feral druid
---
Warriors can farm gold just as well as hunters, don't worry about that. Pick whatever you plan on raiding with the most, so you don't fall behind on gear/loot priority.
---
Also, warriors are more fun PvE imo
---
I’m in the same boat as you and I’m leaning towards doing Hunter first just because of farming possibilities. 
---
That way i can buy my warrior all the good gear making the warrior-leveling a breeze later down the road.
---
In the end it’s more time-efficient to level the hunter first since it’s not gear-dependent.
---
The only down-side is not being able to secure your spot as main-tank in the good guilds.
---
Totally get the sentiment. But I think for most people who do it, they prefer to play the game like how you would experience a movie - it's total immersion, but you get to control your peice, much like an on-screen actor, or even as a "movie extra"  
---
I know we all hear about the "really weird" nonsense, but I think there's probably more of that going on in the "regular" PvE/PvP servers than on RP servers, but I dunno - I've never tried to figure out if that is really the case or not, and I'm not sure I want to know. I just want to enjoy the game my way, without ruining it for anybody else!
---
Are you legitimately serious? Turning your character with "A" and "D" instead of holding down the right mouse button and using the mouse to turn.
---
Bad idea, you think you want changes but you don't.
---
I learned my lesson about that, as I mentioned early, when as a young and eager druid on an RP server, I was spamming MotW around, buffed some folk flagged for PvP then got ganked and camped by a bunch of horde.
---
Never again!
---
NEVER!
---
[Clip I found](https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss)
---
What happens next? I think I will reroll a new class and start over, im just gonna play the game and enjoy it.
---
For 39-42 i recommend you farm the bloodfen raptors in dustwallow marsh. I'm p sure they're lvl 39
---
Would love insight... not as to which class is for me (they both are) but which would be better to get 60 first
---
I’m not too worried about warrior leveling cuz I have a huuuge group of friends that I’ll be playing with and will always have buddies, but hunter is probably a bit more fun to say the least 
---
Any and all thoughts appreciated 
---
Warrior
---
* Pros: I can start gearing earlier? Will have many friends to level with making 1-60 much smoother 
---
* Cons: No gold supplement from main, not as fun at PvP
---
Hunter: 
---
* Pros: 1-60 won’t be unfun, can farm good for warrior alt
---
* Cons: I’m setting my warrior behind?
---
Kargoz def puts the most work and very reliable sources into his guides. He is a gift that stays humble and on the ground while going into a lot of depth about classes.
---
I like that one
---
well the issue is that there's not a clear confirmation of what quests we'll have at the start.
---
They said systems wouldn't changed (class mechanics, item stats, stuff like that will be in it's final form. Aka Alas Andorhol won't have to destroy the tower gems to summon Araj (which was changed because it was buggy as all hell), he'll just be there from the start to kill)), but content would be progressed along a similar patch path to when it released. 
---
I asked for a clarification if Content meant all quests and items or just the ones in the Phase 5 example. But it hasn't gotten a response yet so...I dunno.
---
Until otherwise stated, I'm assuming nothing added past 1.2 will in Phase 1, and planning accordingly.
---
Which means no level 50 class quests until phase 4 (and druids might not get theirs until phase 5 unless they decide to be nice and give them all at once (Everyone else either got theirs in 1.7 or 1.8, but druids didn't theirs until 1.10). No Thorium Point quests, Riventusk Village won't exist (no rune of the Guard Captain), or extra Feralas Quests until Phase 3. Etc.
---
Lol @ blizzard doing it to “preserve” classic and to hell with the finances involved.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing OG emerald dream and the 1.13 content, if they somehow manage to recreate and finish it with the original design in mind (that is so that they feel like vanilla/early tbc and not legion/BFA.
---
Despite what everyone says about AoE grinding, it's only really viable with dynamic respawns if you're on a high pop server. All the known spots are heavily contested
---
no they cant, you're wrong.
---
but go warrior first, because you wanna level you warrior up and get a raid slot as soon as possible, and even though you'll be poor, everyone else will be poor.
---
I've always used both WASD for movement and the mouse to turn the camera.
---
I might do the 1-60 warrior cold as a vanilla rite of passage 😬
---
They retained the community because server get shut down all the time.
---
I love classic but I love tbc even more.
---
Damn, that's pretty cynical if that's their plan..
---
What do you mean they can't lol? I am making 80 g/hr with my warrior. You're not gonna farm much more than that with a hunter
---
Scarlet Monastery is the only one I actually remember.
---
It will probably be a lot of buzz around Reddit and the official forums around launch, so you probably won't be able to miss it.
---
The problem is how do you get your enemies to manually flag for PvP?
---
It's almost impossible to see the same player twice in retail... Community is dead.
---
How?
---
agree transmog fucking duuumb
---
This is what I've been hoping for! So many stories - even some of the raids from TBC and Wrath fit in with vanilla flawlessly! (Mt Hyjal, Karazhan, ICC...)  
---
And the fabled "Emerald Dream" which never happened, or all the empty parts of other zones with much, much more to offer...
---
This is my experience from a RPPVP realm as well. People just tend to be a lot friendlier there.
---
My mate played with his arrow keys because that is what he did in the game we played prior to WoW. 
---
He was a level 60 lock doing MC, ZG and Onyxia by arrowkey walking and clicking every abillity.
---
And you could open the portal at lvl 15 but couldn't enter until 58
---
&gt;But looking at this when played correctly an enh shaman seems more than able to pull their weight, especially in earlier raids.
---
Not really. Would be interesting to see comparison from purely doing autoattacks and totem twisting to the pre-bis gear. I would suspect the raid damage is better if the shaman does totemtwisting for the best melee dps group ( and after nightfall just keeps that debuff up). You wont have mana to do dps AND totemtwisting. You barely have mana to do the normal dps rotation.. you need consumables to keep even that up.
---
Level both with rested Xp for your alt ! 
---
Hunter first prefered if you want to be as fast as possible.(you can buy stuff for your warrior)
---
I had almost forgot how annoying the Soulshard grind was in vanilla. Lots of Drain Soul spam killing mobs before raids or dungeons.
---
Idk bout the rest of you, but no one even used auto join when this was available.
---
TBC was the first thing that ruined wow, no thanks.
---
You right, you right. I didn't know there were 4 though!
---
Yes, it was removed at some point.
---
Great point, I will definitely use the rested XP method.
---
Also good point on the leveling as fast as possible,.. I have a sneaking suspicion that my group will end up as a “race” to 60 rather than a group leveling
---
If only we knew.
---
Herb+mining is how I make most of my gold. Arcane crystals + the occasional black lotus. Then you have DME jump runs, easily 2 manable even with prebis prot gear. Depending on the market, fishing can be really good too. You can flip the AH with alchemy which makes me like 50 passive gold per day. When you getter better gear, farming righteous orbs in strat liv can make you a shit ton aswell. And at launch you're gonna camp devilsaur
---
Why not let everyone feel happy and cool looking? No participation trophies in vanilla that's why. Play as a casual,dress as a casual. Love the true status of vanilla.
---
True, its a long time ago but i cant remember that i ever used that auto join button. It was nice to see where people needed someone and you had to contact them to join the group. Feels Vanilla to me :)
---
That's why you have to no life it for a day or two to get ahead of the pack
---
Oh yeah, I'm sure servers with popular names tend to attract extra players that have no idea which server to pick.
---
TBH Hyjal was amazing. Archimonde was one of the most fun fights I remember playing - so many little things where people died, and it was always hilarious. But the view of the raid spread out so distantly, while fighting this massive demon with sooooo much power was just incredible and awesome. I liked his fight more than Illidan, tbh
---
No, you need to learn everything from scratch again.
---
Lmao thats not how they handle it on pservers.(i play aloooott) and thats not how it was handled back it the day either. It was need it if u need it and greed it u dont need it. Thats the default,  always has been. Even with proffession recipes. Now if you want anything different from that default it is discussed by the group mates prior to the run. &lt;&lt;&lt; this is the most common especially on pservers and older wow. Everyone knows what loot each person is going for and ull know if your going to have to roll that item with someone else, for example having 2 rogues in ur group. You know what kind of group your getting into prior to the run. To add to that, you would all discuss if boes are open for rolls. Its called communcation and thats what were going back to!
---
Yah, stick to questing until like lvl 23 anyway, then you'll have 3/3 imp blizzard at least.
---
After maybe a few years of classic I would love to see some of the old "mystery" zones filled in with maybe some new:
---
*  10 mans :O haha (personal favourite raid size, not popular i know), 
---
* New pvp maps (using some inspiration from rift (black garden etc)) 
---
* Naga playable race (open to some others also),
---
* A heap of new factions,
---
* expansion of the crafting system up to maybe 350, 
---
* maybe some "heroic" classes (like paladin to DK, Hunter to Demon Hunter etc)
---
No need to up the level cap, no need to change any core mechanics, no need for a massive new content, each of these could even just be patched in over time.
---
Yeah I think I’m gonna do skinning for the income while leveling and for the devilsaur skinning late. So do you think Warrior is better to get to 60 earlier?
---
The pros of being the first geared warrior on the server is good, making a name for yourself and helping people with tanking during the early stages can be big.
---
Good luck!
---
Ahem. You forgot click to move sir
---
15-20%? What are you? Level 40?
---
Make sure to stop by these: https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4351. There are also higher level ones south of the door to the barrens
---
FeelRogueMan
---
Yes I'm anonymous :'(
---
Why is Troll the unpopular race of Horde? There the only race I actually like outside of female Orcs.
---
exactly
---
I tried it at lvl 16 it definetly isnt bad if u find a good spot (lions in barrens)
---
Of course they will care about the finances. That still doesn't change the fact that the purpose of the project is to preserve the game. Blizzard can make tons of money off Classic without adding new content to it. They could launch TBC servers for instance. 
---
It boggles my mind how some people (not you perhaps) can consider themselves proponents of "no changes" whilst at the same time they want new content for Classic. New content is a huge change even if it is based on scrapped content. I mean would you like rogues with shields as well? It really does concern me that so many people want new raid tiers and such. If Blizzard ever adds new content for Classic then the game will be ruined. At least that's how I feel.
---
Well, if you plan on raiding with your warrior, that's what I would do. Raiding with two characters is really costly, both in gold and in time. Don't level a hunter just to farm gold, there are much better ways to make gold in vanilla.
---
I haven’t played since BC but can you not buff people anymore?
---
You should kickstart you fucking thing
---
i'll help you and know a lot who wanna do it
---
Same with LFR and many other things
---
Having to be allied with Gnomes keeps me from rolling Alliance this time around, as much as I want to roll Pally
---
Yeah, with no flying mounts, no LFG/LFR, no summoning stones, no space-monkey/goats, no pandas... Basically Classic, but expanding with the raids/class changes.  
---
I mean, if you HAVE to add races, why not add Furbolgs, Goblins and such? Heck, maybe even Nagas, or maybe an alliance "Spirit" race, as a sort of counter to the undead? I mean, zapping random races in like they did was just... insanity. "Oh hey, remember that MASSIVE zone you never knew existed?? Yeah, it always existed, you just didn't know about it... anyway, here's a completely competitive race you knew nothing about that has always been here ready to take over the world..."
---
So your gold farming strategy is to go double gathering professions and get lucky?  
---
That's completely dependent on the market / server population. You're not gonna be making 80 g/ph on a frest start server like that.
---
Also 80g/ph is pretty low for a hunter. farming Diremaul north solo is like consistently 100g/ph just vendoring everything. And when the market is optimal for enchanting mats and mana potions, you can easily break 200g/ph.
---
I was confused cus the post said ‘using WASD ánd keyboard turning’
---
What exactly is the difference?
---
You guys all wanna play Classic but also kinda don't.
---
Making thousands upon thousands of suggestions what in your oppinion would be a great new addition to the game.
---
People are excited for Classic because they actually miss World of Warcraft, the game.
---
If you're looking for new Features, LFG tools and what not you can either use an Addon for current private Vanilla Servers, or just go and play Retail.
---
Let Classic be Classic.
---
r/BoomerMemes
---
I still cannot believe we actually have a date on a new Tool album. I've been waiting for it for - quite literally - half my life.
---
It was the height of my editing skills at the time XD
---
BC was shit. People just love it because they're young and it was their first wow.
---
I'm afraid the situation will be the same in Classic. I'd like to roll on a RP realm (or the RP realm, more likely), but I enjoy PvE and raiding. Don't know what to choose. Depends on a population, I guess, if it's high enough, I hope I'll find 39 players of the same mind.
---
We should make a list of things people will complain about but overall make the game better.
---
Weapon skill/having to visit cities to learn how to use them.  Time it takes to level. Ect.
---
You're welcome :\*
---
Does the mohawk clip through helms or does it remain inside?
---
No thats just missinformed sorry.
---
Warrior has his highst point of power with blue BiS Raid gear according to Monky News, a guy that has done alot of Rank 14 Warris/Naxx Gear and is known as the best Warri.
---
Shaman dos not even has viable Naxx or Rank 13 Gear for ele because of that he suffer alot in endgame gear with the lowst HP pool of any class in BiS Gear.
---
Warlock and Priest, while they scale ok with the DMG the class designe makes it so that they lose power with every gear tier, ofc they get dmg, but they use HP to "tank" ppl in pvp and Stamina / Defense dos not scales this well. 
---
Ofc thats all from a pvp point of view and not true in pve.
---
I would never lie to you.
---
Troll is best tank
---
This is greedvision we are talking about.
---
Yeah you can definitely min-max raid dmg more by cooperating that, but just speaking about solo performance ~400 dps is more than enough for raids like MC and Onyxia's lair.
---
Naw, using chat channels is enjoyable and effective, no reason to change that.
---
Imho Whelpling is an horible choise for Aoe grind. What you whant is a location tightly packed with mele mobs. so you can easily group them and aoe them to death.
---
Whelplings tends to be spread out and pewpewpew you with fireballs like machineguns. I hardly see the aoe grind work with those.
---
Oohhhhhh yes!  
---
Also another one that is simply spectular is underneath Ironforge. No reason it's there. Just an amazing area to explore via getting polymorphed then feared through a wall...
---
Taz'dingo brotha.
---
That's my experience as well. Usually a RP-ish small talk is enough.
---
...also nerf/remove resilience gear
---
It's usually me chasing down Priests as a Mage begging for fort lol, jumping around them and stuff, trading for water etc....Fort is just.....too good! I give Intellect to literally everyone, even Warriors for their weapon skill! &lt;3
---
Yeah, it's not a good system by any measure imo. It's simply based on more playing = better rewards.
---
Are Enhancment Shamans gods at DPS and literally no one noticed for 12 years?
---
Or is this some Shaman propaganda?
---
Hmmmm
---
We can, but having a RpPvP server will make eveything a lot easier.
---
"Easily break 200g/hr". We're talking about prebis here. It would take him like 15 min per run at least and we don't even know if the priv server drop rates are correct. Yeah hunters are easier to farm gold with, but at launch there is just no way you're gonna be able to even push 150 with that gear. 100g/hr sounds more reasonable to me. So to really make the farm "worth it" you'd have to level and then gear the hunter aswell. In that time you would have made made thousands just farming on your warrior.
---
you are right and i absolutely agree with the idea of a lower pace, but you cant really compare games like zelda with an mmorpg like wow.
---
they should continue adding new content in the "classic way" without digging too much into retail styled gameplay like they did with the release of tbc
---
There will be PUG Discords for realms and possibly addons that do this.  No need for Blizzard to change anything.
---
Id say it mostly requires patience to prepare with massive amount of consumables. And not be a fucking idiot (or raiding with ones). Most of the fights arent mechanically difficult, but the raid will crumble fast if everyone in the FULL raid isnt prepared to the same extent. 
---
Like in private server first naxx clear, we had first few tries in sapphiron, loosing even 1 healer would cause a collapse of the whole raid eventually. Kept adding more frost res gear and 3rd (?) pull kill with everyone alive.
---
There are fights where you are completely relying on consumables and resistance potions to keep you alive. But in the end it is a group effort, like always. But its so much easier now that you can use like 1.5y to prepare for it.
---
100% agree with you. Also, vanilla changed, molded and added new content. So, yeah, I would LOVE to \*keep it classic\*
---
Hasn’t it been 12 years?
---
What a new and unique post, good effort!
---
No changes
---
...but, what about the Lich King himself? You want to just leave the rest of the lore untouched because you got T3??
---
I haven't read this much false info in a very long time. Well done.
---
True, but it will never be 100% the same. Don't you think they will sell the token to prevent gold farmers to spam and sell?
---
This is incredible 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
---
I mean even if Naxx is unlocked. There is no catch up system with gear in classic, which means you still have to do Dungeons, then MC or BW, ZG and AQ20-40 . Let alone the attument quests. People will be remembered the grind and lots of people will be stuck on content or stop halfway. Why worry about the end-end raid when not even most of the people will reach it.
---
At that point isnt it more of are you there for your own dps logs or making the raid as smooth as possible ? By the same logic everyone that grinds or pvp's should use their other talent builds because its good enough.
---
Im sure there are guilds that go for that (at least until they keep clearing everything easily). Or PUG runs.
---
Yeah you can rank up and get the pvp gear.
---
When is the game playable?
---
Love it OP, I am a big fan of well organized, printed notes and this takes the cake.
---
do you think with the reboot, blizzard could take their dev stuff in a direction not trodden before?
---
MM Hunter is the most viable all things considered.
---
Yeah, just 2 years ago we never had any hope for official legacy servers nor a new Tool album. 2019 is proving to be a fine year so far.
---
Flying is cool. But should have been restricted to Outlands only.
---
I remember back in Vanilla fantasizing about the implementation of other races.
---
I always liked the High Elves for the Alliance (I know that lorewise this is a stretch).
---
Goblins and Ogres would feel like a neutral category, but I don't like seeing the same races on both factions so I think they would lean Horde for sure, not the neutral goblins but maybe a specific sect of Goblin mercenaries. 
---
Then I start thinking about what mounts they should ride etc and it all just feels so silly lol.
---
WITNESS ME!
---
Nope its [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcZyiYOzsSw)
---
Just saw an old kitty video today. No insane skills or anything but he did kill people quite fast with like 3k hp i think. 
---
 Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwxLIDgSm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwxLIDgSm8)
---
one of the least questions...
---
But what if there will be a diffrent paralell storyline?
---
...which is why it would be better to have more content, even without the gear (but come on, we can't really have that, now!)
---
This exactly. There's no way I have the time to properly play the game AND roleplay. Still, I'll be rolling on an RP-PvP realm if blizz is implementing one. It's just a great crowd to be around and as long as the server is well populated (read: only one RP-PvP realm) it should be great to play on one.
---
Level hunter first because they're so fast and easy. And then level your warrior so you can buy him some blue weapons.
---
...and this is why re-making the future content, but keeping it "classic" would probably be the most legitimate answer imo
---
Ele shaman burst &gt; Hunter burst. Mainly because an Ele can pull of his burst whenever he wants and because its Spelldmg. Hunter can't really "burst" through plate, only cloth/leather classes.
---
TSJK
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about and why you mentioned pvp. All I'm saying is this vid shows it's possible for a geared enh shaman can dish out similar dps as other classes at the starting tiers.
---
It's fine that you want that but you also have to see that most people don't want the Retail experience with expansion packs turned off, they want the original game as it was, *warts and all*.
---
Level an alt for PvP like everyone else had to do, or PvP in premades where tanking and healing specs have a role to play.
---
If you are looking to raid. Shadow priest is a meme spec and you are forced to heal in raids. Mages you are golden specially frost mage
---
But you don't boot up Mario every single day month after month. Blizzard profits of classic from the subscription. If you stop making content then the player base drops off in the same way Mario 64 player base has dropped off since its initial release.
---
Blizzard isn’t out to preserve anything, they never would have and they DEFINITELY don’t care in their current state. People have been screaming for vanilla servers for forever, and with enough evidence now through private servers and other games (EQ, runescape) having success doing it they are testing its viability to make money. If it ever is running at a loss they will strip it down of support, if nothing is left to strip they’ll shut it down. 
---
If it does really well they will (and should) do progressive servers of some type to keep as many people engaged for as long as possible. Progressive could just mean starting a new server fresh every so often so people can compete for world firsts and whatnot, or it could be moving into BC. I’m all for going into BC as long as it’s an opt-in and classic is left alone.
---
Ah yes! East Dragon. The chinese top guild of the server. I also remember the top alliance  guild Sotg (Stature of the Gods). Al'Akir sure had its fair share of good guilds. As I recall it several guilds on both Horde and Alliance side cleared Naxx and some dozens of them cleared part of Naxx.
---
Only 3 hours in a day? Damn, that's a lot! I'd be glad if I have around 30-60 minutes. 😂
---
As a Warrior. Shoot one, still pull three. Bite down, they're going in dry.
---
Not really too interested in raiding although, mostly pvp endgame. Is shadow priest any good in pvp?
---
If you don't care about speed and you want to PVP, play them both.  I'm planning on playing 3.
---
Shadow priests are really good in PvP. But then again PvP is known for frost mages also. So either for PvP haha
---
Good to know, thanks for the feedback.
---
New content on classic servers works by new servers popping up and people like to play on a fresh server again. Potentially this is also something blizzard would do.
---
Also I wouldn't base your expectations on what blizzard have said. They have changed their minds many times before. (Not necessarily a bad thing).
---
Good point lol and I may end up doing that, just not sure which one first.
---
But then we'll all have to campaign for classic classic servers.
---
I liked that both factions had a different class.  If we expand that out a bit, give one faction DH and the other DK.
---
I am this. Exactly the same dilemma here.
---
frost mage or shadow priest. Really cant decide
---
No way. Even if the can't combat gold selling fully, the token is an official way to buy gold for money. There's no way they legimitize that in classic without an gigantic uproar from the community. Buying gold is "forbidden" and should be.
---
Yes Hyjal was my favorite TBC raid. Yes there was an annoying amount of trash that spawned on timers which gave the raid a "minimum time" aka you didn't clear it much faster even though you outgeared it, which was annoying. But the raid was epic as fuck.
---
&gt; Classic is not about a second chance at making WoW great again.
---
Who says that? You are right that classic is about „preservation“, for now. Imagine classic becomes as popular as we all hope it will be. Now fast forward a few years and subs drop significantly because people get bored. And I am absolutely certain that the majority will get bored, if there will not be new content added. So, what du you think, will blizzard just sit by and watch the subs dwindle? Of course they won’t. And I really hope they don’t. I do want classic to be the second chance to wow. As long as they don’t repeat the same mistakes and keep the design that made vanilla great, I’m all for new content and changes. One change I’d want from the start is new class balance, so that every class role is viable and competitive.
---
Oh you think it will be yours....
---
Taz'dingo amigo!
---
It’s tough bro. Like I like the idea of the versatility in spriest yet mages are just badass.
---
This is a good thing because it makes warlocks a much more diserable class to bring to dungeons and raids.
---
LOL I remember that one throwing me for a loop for the longest time
---
One YAY to you for not being too lazy for research. Mercí :-*
---
&gt;  Savory Deviate Delight recipe
---
This is just a random drop from all over the world? Or can it be farmed?
---
Frost mages are good in pve and pvp. Shadow are basically gods in pvp. Priests will basically be forced to heal in any pve content.
---
Thanks for posting this, I forgot how to google today.
---
By default A and D are bound to "rotate your character" and Q/E are bound to strafing. Most people rebind A and D to "strafe left" and "strafe right" and only turn by rightclicking their mouse. This allows for a more fluent movement, especially as the default turn rare is rather slow.
---
Back in vanilla this was not as common and even more people turned by using A/D.
---
Can’t convince you because you are right.We got the glorious Human Paladins and Warriors, the little Gnome Mages, the real Druids and the noble and drunken Dwarf. Join the glorious Alliance!
---
To be fair, the community actually did want the ability pruning.
---
And whats your plan for acquiring gear? You wanna go for Rank 10 or even R13/14? You know this is gonna consume all your time. Since you mentioned you have kids, I highly doubt your gonna go for that. Getting gear via raiding is far more easy, than no-lifing for 3 Months to get R14.
---
A few notable points:
---
* Classic will not have a Honor system at launch. During that time, there is no way to obtain gear besides PvE
---
* On the second content phase (I would guess, anything from 6 weeks to 3 months after launch), a Honor system is introduced, but no battlegrounds to go with it, so world PvP only. There are Rank rewards available, but only few pieces can be obtained relatively quickly. 
---
The actual PvP blue set will take months to get (R7-R10), and painful too, especially on world PvP only for a solo warrior. In my opinion, gearing up via PvP only becomes somewhat viable in the third content stage, with BGs and BG Reputation rewards. Cost-Benefit-wise, it's still a horrible way to gear up of course.
---
Frankly, I would just go Fury, get preBiS, join a raiding guild, get a few MC pieces, and start PvPing when content stage 3 arrives. But that's just me.
---
Wotlk and cata were way more popular, not because they weren't dogshit but because they had been optimized for getting most players. Classic isn't optimized for shit, if you're bad you're not getting anything.
---
Shaman has burst potential in Elemental spec and just Windfury in general, but ita kind of a slot machine.
---
If you want consistency, I suggest Hunter. Feral druids have a lot of options at their disposal from their spells, but it sounds like you want to melt faces and Druids just dont do that.
---
It is finite in a way, because private servers keep starting fresh realms.
---
Thanks for the insight, I do have kids and have a pretty busy schedule, not too keen on classic pvp so I’m not sure of the difficulty in achieving those ranks. I guess I’ll find out, still though not really trying to be stuck as a healer a majority of the time. I don’t mind healing but I don’t like the idea of paying to reset my talents if I want to do some pvp. Maybe frost mage first.
---
And 850 dps preraid? Are you pulling these numbers from your asshole? 
---
No mage specs fire preraid. And no mage will deal 850 dps in preraid gear.
---
Google.
---
But shadow priest for PvP.
---
good idea, and afterwards cry about all the things that disappoint you while playing ...
---
like bugs 
---
 and exploits 
---
  and unstable servers 
---
   and unfinished quests 
---
and login qeues 
---
and server crashes 
---
and rollbacks
---
It's a random green drop available only in the barrens that has an extremely low chance to drop from any mob there. It can be farmed in the sense you could just endlessly kill mobs there and pray, but odds are you'd get spiked club of the boar instead.
---
You can do 5 mans just fine as arms. The only reason for why fury is unviable in raids is because a large portion of your damage comes from Mortal Strike and it takes up a valuable debuff slot.
---
The first day?
---
I think this was a rare drop in just the Barrens. That combined with the fact the fish could only be caught in WC made fishing and selling it on the alliance AH quite profitable
---
Looks like you got it all figured out already. Pick whatever seems the most fun to you. Nobody can tell you what's more fun, really.
---
I had most of my upgraded dungeon set before i got my cap :(
---
Getting R13/14 is almost impossible, if you don't have the time to pvp for at least 8+ hours a day, 7 days a week. Would go with frost mage aswell, since you can raid and pvp at the same time. Find a casual guild that does clear at least BWL and you will get decent gear as time passes, without giving up you real life.
---
start with hunter because he is not gear dependent and a fast leveler, level your hunter until 37+, send a few gold to your warrior so he can buy few greens for easier levling. park your hunter in the blasted lands and camp for broken tooth, check if he spawned from time to time while leveling your hunter. when you tamed broken tooth let your heart decide which char you want to continue first
---
The difficulty for getting Rank 10+ is not to bad, but the time requirement is insane. It's nearly impossible unless you can dedicate 4-5 hours a day for 3-4 months.
---
Faction imbalance messed up raiders more than rp ever did.  If your server faction was minority, raiding was shit.
---
Your post is a good example of why these discussions worry me as someone who is for no changes. You go from "You are right that classic is about ,,presevation", for now" to "One change I'd want from the start is new class balance"... How about Blizzard makes the game as it were back then and that we all want and then add fresh servers every once in a while? Why do you want to change the game? Please, don't ruin this for us by making ridiculous requests.
---
r/WoW is that way &lt;-
---
Rp is kinda weird...
---
Those timers never bothered me. I loved it. I played a hunter and got to kite adds, which was so fun. Never got old for me. And when we out-geared it, it was just a matter of picking that one person I wanted to mess with, misdirect to him and/or feign death at an inopportune moment. I remember my raid leader sorta hated me for it, but I also kept things lighthearted and fun, so I got away with a lot of shenanigans.
---
I still remember when someone noticed I had pulled a nonsense pet - it was a wind-serpent. And suddenly vent explodes when he saw the pets name. It was sorta x-rated, and not something I would ever have pulled outside of a group of friends or a guild run. They lost it, and it was hilarious. We lost a good 5 minutes as they fell about dying of laughter, just over a name. Good times...
---
Activision: I am inevitable.
---
×  Doubt
---
&gt;Nobody took ground mounts away if that is what you find fun, and epic ground mounts were faster than normal flying ones.
---
This argument has been proven time and time again to not work in game design, even more so multiplayer ones. You can't give people a "solve all your problems" tool and then just tell them not to use it. As a game designer it's your task to ensure that the game is fun by default, not only with arbitrary self-inflicted limitations.
---
&gt;So you need a group for group PvP. I am okay with this.
---
It's literally not group PvP.
---
&gt;You're the one who is apparently massively butthurt by other people liking different things
---
Et tu?
---
&gt;They coped. PvP still happened. They still played on PvP servers. There were still always places you could pick a fight if you really wanted one.
---
That's not adapting. That's just dealing with being a third-rate citizen who doesn't matter and trying your best to at least find some entertainment in the off-corners of the game.
---
&gt;What you are doing here is being a crybaby
---
&gt;Things change and you either adapt or whine about it.
---
"Either you deal with being a third-rate citizen or shut your whining you crybaby."
---
Just a fast comment. I made a lvl 59 gnome twink warrior back in vanilla and had a lot of fun with her. Icebarded spear is amazing for that lvl.

I never got mine.  I built up like 800g or so and then gave it to my sister and quit, ne'er to look back until this summer.  I probably would have been stoked about it, though.
---
I didn't mind flying mounts that much in TBC. You still needed to get to 70 in order to enjoy one - which was slow as shit. You needed to save up 5k for the proper speed, at the time that was a lot of money. Who remembers farming those bloody netherdrake eggs for money? I had awesome PvP times thanks to those.
---
Wotlk was the real game killer for me, trivialising flying due to being able to buy the skill for alts, combined with the introduction of LFG, the gear level hard on everyone had, the introduction of heroic/hard modes (my biggest gripe, which I can go into).
---
TBC, in a lot of ways, was the natural evolution of the game. A lot changed, a lot of it I didn't like, but it wasn't miserable. I still have very fond memories of world pvp in TBC, not to mention the beautiful content - tier 5 was a gaming achievement within a game that was already a gaming achievement.
---
A friend of mine always told me he would go to low level alliance areas and mindcontrols enemies to buff other alliance players. No idea if this actually works but it‘s one hell of a funny „gank“

I'd go for one of the dungeon sets before the PvP ones become available and try farming enough honor before Battlegrounds drop with world PvP. Of course if you can raid straight out of the bat then there is not much point to the dungeon sets.
---
There are also some quests that send you all over the world for some decent gear but they take time investment :).

Probably Hunter, but it depends upon your goals.

If you are trying to get in with the top guild on your server or be a Main Tank or something, it might be important to get 60 with warrior as quickly as possible to establish yourself on the server.

Otherwise, hunter is probably best, as you can give gear to your warrior, and also Farm early on with your hunter to buy mats when they are super cheap that will increase with time as investments. Plus hunter is strongest early on, so you'll get the most fun of your hunter if you get him some gear/rhok'delar as soon as possible and start dominating pvp with him in phase1/2, especially since that's when world pvp will shine and hunter is not only strongest during this phase, but also excels in world pvp. Not to even mention you will be the king while leveling on a fresh server. This is assuming you pvp of course.  
---
Meanwhile, your warrior just keeps getting better as Vanilla goes on, so you aren't missing out so much unless you are really trying to establish yourself as a particularly reputable tank. 
---
TL;DR: If you will be going Fury or somewhat casual, level hunter first, especially if you care about pvp.
---
If you want to be in the top guild/an important Main tank, there's argument for leveling warrior first.
---
Is it available for wow ? Wtf
---
Hm, what do you mean with versatility in spriest? Actually mage is quite more versatile If you ask me. Mage playstyle is way more action and theres many different PVP spec options. Spriest is basically a quite boring class compared to mage.
---
Ah, too bad but makes sense. Thank you for the answer!
---
I very much agree with your second paragraph about the future of Classic. Just to clarify since I may have been unclear in my earlier post. By "new content" I mean content that was never part of the game in any of its iterations. As such adding fresh servers or BC servers (with an opt-in solution and vanilla servers still available) is not the same as "new content".
---
One for each nightmare dragon.
---
Ah, too bad. Thank for the answer!
---
Yeah, it's an issue and it's fixable with having zones like isle of Quel'Danas from the start for reputation shenanigans that most players would do for outdoor.
---
I personally never had a problem with flying mounts, but I wasn't on a PvP server with ninja's dropping from the sky.
---
Probably they should have had a max speed of 60%. This would make them still able to get to all the awesome areas of Outland etc, but still cause everyone to switch to land mounts for long distance.
---
Druid is a class that ramps up. Only at 20 do you start becoming tier 1 leveling speed. By level 30 you're leveling at the same speed if not faster at times than a hunter.
---
1-20 is a little rough though. But even on hunters 1-10 sucks too
---
I would be okay with horizontal content. New zones, either for leveling or just endgame quests with grinding spots.  
---
New dungeons with the same difficulty and loot level as strat/scholo/lbrs. No new mechanics on items, different stats might be okay.
---
Why would you just straight up lie to people?
---
RP servers are confirmed.
---
There will be RP-PvE, but at this time it looks unlikely that there will be RP-PvP.
---
If WoD itself was an alternate reality... why would Grom gonthwrw in the first place, why would the prince of the black dragon flight send him to an alternate reality?  No Grom was sent into the past to change history.
---
So the orcs were not corrupted meaning no invasion of Azeroth by orcs, no Ner'zul to corrupt Arthas, etc.  But on top of that somehow Gul'dan went into the future and tried to use Illidan but since the orcs never waged war in Azeroth Illidan would have no way of becoming more powerful the feline energies FROM GUL'DAN'S SKULL!
---
GAH! I hate WoD so much, but does time travel and does int insainly wrong.
---
It is possible that WoD did create some kind of alternate universe but that means the point at which those two universes diverged was the point where Grom arrived in the past. From that point there would be two separate universes, one where Grom never showed up and one where he does.  
---
Our WoW classic could be the one where he  ever shows up.
---
At least druid weapon should are always maxed when shifted. Warriors are typically 1-2 full levels below their actual level
---
Having done both on pservers I'd say no.  However I admittedly have not played a shadow priest on actual vanilla, but I did play a pally (ret and prot leveling).
---
Thing with shadow priest is, unless you massively outgear/outlevel the mobs you're wanding and swping like you say.  It's like an extremely inefficient warlock without a pet.  Whereas pally is either running around with rank1 SoC and BoW and pretty much never going oom - or in the 30s+ is aoe killing 5-8 mobs at a time.
---
Of course, why wouldn't it be.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OtVEaC1d7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OtVEaC1d7o)
---
When I was a little pally, I stumbled into a pack of wild Murlocs. I killed one, but another joined, I healed myself and killed another, but more kept coming!  
---
I was surrounded by fishy groans and wacks to the face when suddenly a lvl 60 mage comes outta no where and AoEs the bejesus out every murloc in the area yelling "Revenge".
---
Still makes me smile to this day.
---
Wow tokens would be the worce thing they could implement in classic.
---
Eh, it's  not that bad.
---
I just mean versatile in the sense that I can off heal myself and what not. Not necessarily just dps. I have decided on rolling UD frost mage when classic comes out though
---
Side note - The Real Bros of Simi Valley is amazing.
---
I do not jump between two opposing opinions. Blizzard's goal for now is "preservation"; this is what they have stated and I believe that is what we are going to get, which I am fine with. That does not automatically mean that I don't think the game can be better than it was. That also does not mean that I like some of the (sometimes quite major) design flaws the game had.
---
\&gt;  Why do you want to change the game? 
---
Because I know that I (and probably many others) will get bored after everything, including Naxx is on farm status. And who says that changes cannot be part of classic? Vanilla was changed from 1.0 to 1.12, partially because the devs had to fix their previously bad designs (which were there to begin with, because they didn't know any better). One of the changes throughout vanillas was: class reworks, which still weren't great in 1.12. The original devs said themselves that they wanted to rework the shaman even more in vanilla, but didn't because TBC was around the corner anyways. So why would I not want classes to be better balanced? Where you aren't forced to play heal as a hybrid class because the other specs are sub par.
---
\&gt;   Please, don't ruin this for us by making ridiculous requests.
---
I am not the one making ridiculous requests. Have you seen #nochanges being against being able to toggle auto looting (not to be confused with AOE looting)? If that is not ridiculous then I don't know what is. I just want WoW to be the best it can be. And I want to have real discussion about what would actually be a good change (weighing the pros and cons), instead of just always jumping to the non-argument of #nochanges.
---
How about the haunted mills in tirisfal glades
---
Wasn't asking to tell me what's fun, was asking wether I got it right or not :) And for some PvP stories :)
---
Stop it, it hurts :(
---
RP-PvP realms were always graveyards. Roleplayers can't Roleplay because the open world is PvP enabled. PvPers can't PvP because Roleplayers will hide in Cities so they can Roleplay uninterrupted. RP-PvP realms don't work.
---
You are the vocal minority. You are either blissfully ignorant of the reality of RP-PvP realms or willingly misrepresent the case for RP-PvP realms. I don't know which is worse and at this point, I don't think I care to find out.
---
Go away.
---
Azhara Crater, the BG that got scrapped from Vanilla.
---
Well, the only real side effect would be that mages and hunter players would never have to pay for their sub again, or no other class could realistically buy a token. I'm not really fond of the idea.
---
Westfall. At Night. Heavy rain. Can't see SH\*T.
---
You don’t need to respec for any other content than raids. For phase 1 there are decent blues, but obviously a lot of upgrades in 40-man content (BRE, rings, belt, gloves, neck from ony etc). 
---
Raiding is by far less time consuming than pvp if you plan on anything but the blue set and exalted with AV.
---
People didn't know it back in the day but there is blue ZG trinket that improves taunt hit chance by 10%. The tier bonus only improves it by 5%.
---
There was a post a few days ago regarding hunter rotation.
---
It was quite "innovative" in the sens it's not something you see often on Pserver as it requires a higher skill cap and more focus than almost every other class.
---
It's similar to the power-shapeshifting of the feral drood.
---
It increases the dps of the hunter by 50-100? but it's still not enough to compete with war/mage/rogue/lock in terms of pure damage
---
I understand the appeal of RP-PvP servers but nevertheless, I am not going to play on one. 
---
The reason is the faction imbalance.  https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/ 
---
If you chose RP-PvP in &lt;i&gt;What type of server will you be playing on?&lt;i/&gt; (also chose a region) and press Apply Filter You'll see that the ration Horde/Alliance is 45.5/55.5. For the Europe region, the ration is even worse: 39/61. 
---
Сonsidering that this subreddit and, consequently, the survey is skewed towards NA/Horde and more hardcore population in general, the reality is going to be much worse.
---
Can we switch lives?  My coworker has a guild in retail with around 80 people that are all going alliance hardcore in classic, they asked me to come along.
---
How could I skip out on the chance to be friends IRL with a guild master of such massive sized guild?
---
I’ve mained, lived and breathed horde since wrath...
---
I can only speak for the hunter and I agree with most of your points, except the following:
---
Super hard to play vs well played healing classes
---
If you drain their mana with viper sting you don't have any problems against any type of mana user (except maybe a really well playing druid). Just kite them at max range if possible until their mana goes to 0.
---
Hell, I played on Cenarion Circle and never role played. It was just a better experience than a non-RP server.
---
I never used "S"
---
That's only really true for casual players. Normal mode in BFA is way harder than MC and BWL, heroic is like Naxxramas and mythic is just way beyond anything vanilla can produce. 
---
Raid difficulty isn't why I love vanilla though.
---
I'm 100% sure there will be queues and overpopulated servers because blizzard didn't made enough servers for everyone.
---
Announcement. I hate waiting without a set deadline in general.
---
This is very accurate, you want those moo boys and skeletons to be on your side. Running around with midgets in your team feels inferior.
---
This punishes the whole raid. He gets a summon but he gets lowest loot priority for the week
---
That won't happen for Vanilla.
---
However, you never know; it might be separate. Multiple expansions to pick from on a single client. TBC realms or vanilla realms.
---
It's entirely possible they called it Classic to have these possibilities open for the future.
---
But they'll never ever rerelease TBC over the active vanilla servers. That would destroy the entire purpose of this.
---
U main a warrior ?
---
Was just pointing out, everyone has reasons to use less effective specs. Healers might want to use skills that they want for grind killing (like prot spec healer paladins) or warriors raiding arms because between raids they do pvp.
---
A guild can be BUILT around doing that, but if others are forced to optimize their used class...
---
I used arrow keys and numpad to play back then. Don't ask me how I manged that.
---
Genji?
---
Just a thing about your role as a tank. Keep in mind that being both main tank and guildmaster takes a lot of time and dedication. I've seen several people with both roles burn out over the years.
---
Damn you decided fast
---
Well I like world pvp and the fact u can get attacked while grinding mobs and even when u can flee your attacker he can still chase u down with mount. In newer versions of wow u cc and u take ur flying high in the skies, so who cares if u get attacked
---
Better theory crafting now, and also the introduction of powershifting. str is actually slightly better if you don't powershift but agi is better because of crit if you do.
---
Yeah, thanks for the warning.  I don't plan on being main tank into raiding, just while we're levelling/gearing up and still building our raid group.  We don't have enough players to get a solid 40 man group going yet, and I figure the best way to recruit good people is to tank 5-mans.
---
Burning out is a real fear, though.
---
While i agree with you on the other things, i disagree with the raiding part. Vanilla raids are just a gear check with not much real difficulty. As WoW progressed the raids became harder and harder with tons of mechanics to learn and mythic difficulty
---
TBC is my favorite "game" of all time. No game has as many fantastic memories as TBC. I'm praying Classic is a success that is able to retain a significant playerbase because I'm positive that will spur them to do a separate TBC server as well. If I recall correctly, they said they wanted there to be a permanent Classic. With that said, I dont see why they couldnt have separate permanent TBC servers. Drunken Kara runs. God those were fun
---
Every time I get buffed I scan my bars for something I can do in return and every time I just end up finding the /thank macro. :(
---
Same
---
How could a feature that was never in vanilla feel like vanilla? This is a TBC feature.
---
Na, it's not good for beginners. It's the best ;)
---
&gt; Illidan would have no way of becoming more powerful via the feline energies FROM GUL'DAN'S SKULL!
---
illidan stormrage - cathunter
---
I wont be against releasing wotlk servers!
---
I can guarentee you that if you take this attitude going forward you are going to end up spending more time LFG than you are doing anything else.  I have played private realms for over a decade and meet a few people like you from time to time.  The fact is those people are also those that are not able to get a GUILD INVITE  let alone instance invites.  
---
This is a team game, you start rolling need on BOE's you cant use I will be either kicking you or leaving the group myself.  
---
You are literally saying,  I am being a ninja to stop others doing it to me.  Well you enjoy having zero people wanting to group with you.
---
Do you guys get a kick out of suggesting different things than the norm or something? This is the first time I've seen someone advocate for a release delay in a video game. Genuinely curious.
---
You could farm thousands and thousands of gold on your warrior in the time it'd take to level a hunter. There are tonnes of farming options for warriors. Dire Maul jump runs, Strat Live runs, etc.
---
It’s coming this summer.  No way they can delay it now.
---
Yeah, even one single ranged mob will fuck up your style. Unless you sheep it first
---
You still buff people in retail
---
Unpopular opinion: flying didnt kill world pvp, at least not in tbc. While I really dont like it aswell,  going through some old pvp videos couple of gems really changed my view on tbc and its world pvp. For instance:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAoe3akMZUE&amp;t=340s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAoe3akMZUE&amp;t=340s)  
---
World pvp kinda died off slowly being pushed into specific zones (wotlk,cata) and general design of the game, and max level zones. In cata you didnt really meet people out that much, and they could easily evade you with a cc and epic flying mount. Only wpvp place was Tol Barad, which was really great in my opinion, I had clashes with opposing faction every 15-20 mins. For me it was a blast, but real wpvp died off completely. Ofc the fact that if you didnt have pvp gear, your wpvp experience was really crappy starting with tbc for most classes (fdruid and enhc shaman come to mind, wth great pve gear and pvp off pieces you could be deadly, maybe even a bigger threath than with full pvp gear). THis is probably the biggest problem with wow starting with tbc, separation of gear and breaking the game into two seperate paths.  
---
When it comes to social meta, I believe similar thing happened, we were gradually pushed towards a certain design and casual people didnt care about wpvp that much. You didnt have the gear, nor the need to do anything besides your quests and daily chores. Game was seperated into two different paths, and I believe that is way bigger problem than flying mounts.
---
One of the reason we join grps is because we inadvertently see them being spammed.
---
With this abomination you never see what's going on. What's poppin or popular. Who is currently looking and leading.
---
Keep this trash out
---
"hunter weapon, hunter weapon, oh this was made for a hunter!"
---
How is this 'advocating'? It's me saying that I won't mind if there's a delay because they want to ensure the game is on point?
---
Nah thanks, I want sharding and will play Classic, with sharded starting areas for the first few weeks. Just as Blizzard said.
---
Very wholesome, have a like :)
---
Summer is Q3 and ends in September, that would be no delay.
---
Man now im sad. I made a few million at launch for crafting some mecha mogul mk2 mounts and darkmoon cards but i spent it all on CoD, hearthstone packs and wc3 remastered. I dont regret wc3 or hs packs but i wish i saved the 60 i spent on CoD, I never play that shit
---
It wasn't even an expansion, it was the base game. It's literally where everybody was a total beginner. I'd say it's less beginner friendly than retail now, as everything is practically handed to you on a silver platter, but it's a fantastic introduction into what an MMORPG should look like.
---
Ready &gt;&gt; Early
---
Amen brother, amen.
---
Its hard for me because for me its between frost mage and priest. I like both shadow and mostly the healing playstyle alot. But i don’t think ill like the leveling with a priest (only raiding and dungeons) and then i think as frost mage dungeons are less fun but pvp will be better.
---
Been torn between the two for weeks...
---
You could always go Druid then, and switch roles later to DPS or Healing. You can do all 3 roles while leveling.
---
I don't think you know what advocate means
---
Bring me classic, I don't care about the phases.
---
Trying to grab those damn beached sea creature skeleton quests.. nope lol, Run away! Run away!
---
That's pretty nice, and remember that you can tank 5-mans in any spec as a warrior/paladin/druid. Don't level as prot.... Having friends and especially irl friends in the game is a big burnout prevention. I kinda do worry about guilds who are at the raidlog phase. On private servers you just show up two nights a week and that's that, but on Classic you actually have to pay for it.. maybe they hope that raidloggers will try out BFA since they share sub. I probably will.
---
It will be not only 1-10 zones obviously. So can you answer my question: how hard it is going to fuck economy? Or you just guess and believe that all should be O.K. as all very far-sighted and wise people do? Do you realize that sharding affects ores, leather, herbs and other professions? Do you have any idea how oversaturated the market will be in the first few weeks because of sharding? I think you don't have a clue.

Not all of us play the faction for OP pvp racials, just sayin

I hope we get a world channel that everyone joins. They are like the barrens and trade chat combined. I just hope they tune down the lazy and edgy racist jokes/memes that are so prevalent on private servers.
---
Overpopulated servers mean more potential for sharding as well  😥

Hard to be optimistic when you look at the sorry state of AAA game companies, so much is constantly ruined by greed these days. 10 years later, the talents at Blizzard are not the same and the marketing team has a strong grip on the franchise.

I'LL SHOOT YOU A LIGHTNING BOLT, FUCKER

hi satan im your biggest fan

Go undead or troll priest, both have good racial priest spells.  Going to make a female troll priest myself as an alt.
---
A thorns buff for a warrior from low to mid level is better than anything in the whole wide world. 😍😍😍
---
Only if your 5 man has a Warlock (with a mount before 40, often, too).
---
They have started at once with realease of Burning Crusade. And after Burning Crusade we had release of WotLK with even more subscribers on board. We may never see such popularity again, so don't worry.
---
Yes, I have an idea. There were many fresh realm starts back in 2007-2009. I've seen 10-20k ppl queues during first days not once.
---
Yeah, I mean I can always alt shadow priest ya know?
---
It is a complicated matter. As others have said, by adding new content into classic then it will no longer be classic and it will risk ruining what made classic what it is. On the other hand, I am open to new contents while still playing within the lvl gap of 60.

If you want changes to class balance and things like that then Classic is not for you. I am sorry to say this but: go play retail where Blizz already are implementing modern design concepts and trying to achieve perfect class balance. This is a major part of the reason why WoW sucks now. Many of us (I dare say the vast majority who have been advocating for vanilla servers since BC basically) appreciate the class balance of vanilla. Some specs are not optimal but almost all are viable if you know how to play, spec and gear them. You must see how frustrating it is for those of us who have begged for vanilla for so long only to have people like you try to advocate changes for it when we're finally getting it. The objective for now is to preserve the game. There are no reasons to change this objective. Ever. There are other solutions to retain players. For instance adding opt-in BC servers.
---
How is it buying gold? Its just changing hands from one to another player...
---
If you like raiding and dungeons you'll have a much easier time getting invited as a healer. The leveling is only a small part of the game and even then it's easier as shadow than most classes.
---
Personally, I hate the look of the new models. The way they move I feel like I’m playing a jump n run.
---
Same with  " [*Of Blood and Honor*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Of_Blood_and_Honor) " by Chris Metzen, that is how I came to hate that pompous ass [Uther](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uther_Lightbringer), along with all the other human leaders.
---
Hello, 
---
Every class you mention has it's purpose and role to fill in pvp ...
---
Reading your post I come to conclusion that you are looking for a specific play style ... hunting on people ... killing them ... jumping on them ... ganking ... more like attacking than defending ... 
---
If I'm right in that conclusion you should play Hunter ... NE Hunter to have shadowmeld and be able to ambush people and do crazy stealthy stuff:) 
---
While leveling you would be a monster which most players just fear ... sometimes it is pushed to the point of almost unfair 
---
At early and mid gear 60 you will respec to MM ar MM mainly hybrid for pvp so your utility kit and burst will increase ... if played well you will again eat people alive ... keep in mind ... if played well !! 
---
At late and end gear 60 you will play MM or MM mainly hybrid or Surv mainly hybrid for pvp and than all will depend on your skill as a pvp player ... engineering is also a key ... you can win with everyone but some matches are pure skill and luck based not necessarily in your favour ... your burst will be less impactful ... at this time your consistency + utility set will give you wins ... you can watch end game gear videos where hunter kicks ass and if equally matched they win because they use everything they got in correct time ... 
---
Keep in mind I'm talking only about NE hunter with shadowmeld ... shadowmeld opens a little more subtle play style ... if you want play horde choose Orc for crazy good stun resist racial ... however than you will have more direct approach with no real sneaky flavour :P ... same with dwarf, great with stoneform (FU rogues form :P ) but than this is more direct approach ...
---
To sum Hunter up, this class is a ... hunter ... if you want to hunt for people in wPvP play damn Hunter :P ... utility to control fight, disengage, track down and fight again on your terms ... hunter ... NE gives more flavour to it (in my opinion- worth it) 
---
Shaman is great class and very enjoyable but you have less utility ... it is also hard / hard'ish :P to pvp master but while you play him you count on some RNG procs ... (not only crit) ... about this less utility sometimes it really hurts ... but you have heals ... :) 
---
Druid is great and fun class (I played one myself ... I main hunter in vanilla but I also play druid) and I love this flexibility ... but as druid you are good at so many things that you are not great at any ... ok ok ok ... flag carrier ... so survivabilit ... yes I agree :P ... if you want a class to enjoy overall go druid ... if you want to enjoy killing people ... don't go druid :P
---
If you are looking for a burst class that can heal from time to time and can be a great asset to any PvP group - Shaman is your way to go.
---
If you are looking for a hardcore positioner with the highest skill cap that can take down multiple enemies if everything goes as he wishes - Hunter is your way to go.
---
If you are looking for a class that can do it all but with limitations, has multiple playable builds, is sought after for every PvE and PvP group - Druid is your way to go.
---
It seems that you already know what class does what, know their strengths and weaknesses, and understand their core mechanics. I would suggest you try and play some vanilla Pserv. and test each of the classes. You will see for yourself which class fits you the best. You will see them in action. Obviously, you won´t get the real picture as you will not be as good as a hunter as you would be as a Shaman right off the bat. That´s because of the skill cap. But the feeling of the class and the playstyle will be there.
---
I would suggest trying a mage as well. He has all 3 aspects that you seek after and he is, hands down, the most versatile PvP class in the entire game - being great at WPvP, BGs, 1v1, and 1vX.
---
From my POV - I will be playing Druid simply because I want it all. I don´t need to deal high burst damage or be a control god. I want to be able to adapt to every situation thrown in my way and deal with it. I like the versatile playstyle that this class offers and, if played correctly with the right build, you will take down almost every class in a 1v1 and some classes in 1vX. You can take down Warriors, Mages and Rogues easily. Pallies, Hunters and Shamans may be a skill match. Shadow Priests and Warlocks will be your doom for late game if they are fully geared. Since it will take 2 years to fully gear them from start of the classic, I wouldn´t worry too much about them. At the beginning of the classic, You will be able to level up faster than any other class (on par with Hunter and Warlock) and you will get your gear easily since there is not much competition for your gear in Dungeons. That means that you will be stronger than others by putting less time in the actual game. You will be running in BiS while most Warlocks will be running in greens and Priests will be healers. You will be able to take them down in one combo, run away and refill. 
---
Most people don´t know the full potential of a Druid simply because there were not that many PvP feral Druids back in the day. Most people were doing PvE and Druids were healers. That means that not that many Druids were able to have full feral set with a good weapon, nor had time to grind rank 14 for EQ. On the other hand, there were tons of warriors and warlocks with the best gear that spent literally thousands of hours to get that gear which you have seen in some videos. If you have a job, girlfriend or kids and some other side activities, you won´t be able to get that full gear anyway. That being said - try to look for a class that can do good in BiS for a long period of time - that´s why I suggested Mage as well.
---
Everyone acts like they'll even make it to Naxx..
---
I want the game to be 100% identical to vanilla wow. I want to go back to the 7th grade me and fully experience what blew my mind. I fully accept the original graphics of vanilla wow with open arms.
---
lol Ravenholdt and Venture Co both had great world pvp, active raiding, lots of roleplayers on both. Ravenholdt used to have all sorts of organized events, like battles at Caer Darrow.
---
new Graphics - 100% yes from me.
---
Features - NO !  
---
Features change the way, the game is played, therefore it wont be vanilla/ classic anymore..
---
That is 100% never going to happen.
---
Same. I used arrow keys to move, numpad to switch between bars (did not have to switch often though). Did have everything keybound and turned with the mouse/strafing, so I wasn't really doing anything wrong but just... using the entire freaking keyboard in the process.
---
If I've learned one thing it's that your approach doesn't really matter that much as long as you're good at using it. People would be surprised to know how many clickers managed to get to top arena ranks.

I've played on RP servers since Wrath due to friends switching to them and I've got varied experiences.
---
The average player tends to be nicer, the kind who you will encounter while questing or just grouping up in order to deal with that one elite. The issues start once you want to progress: some will be completely clueless and in many cases lash out and be extremely protective of them being entitled to play the game 'their way', which is fine - but a mage in strength cloth bashing mobs with his staff won't do much good for the group. At the same time there's the opposite issue once you get up in ranks, where the people who are far into progress tend to get kind of an elitism-complex due to them truly being the elite on a server mostly composed of casuals. This brings forth a lot of toxic attitude, some of which are way worse than what I ever experienced on PvE or PvP servers.
---
I do personally enjoy a lot of the things that RP servers bring, but they aren't without flaws.
---
True, as a DOTA player i remember a while back when Auto-Chess came out and I went to several streams think i would see ACTUAL DOTA, but got some chess thing. It got seperated a bit later though, so it's all good.
---
How can they delay a game that has been already made since 2004. If they delay this blizzard has officially become too stupid for us to have faith in them. If they released the 2004 version I would have just played that. The only reason this is taking so dam long is they want it on a more modern client that can have a cash shop. We are currently waiting for these idiots to put a cash shop in classic.
---
no  I want it like it was
---
I'll take it either way. For me there are two reasons why classic was better than current. 1) Homogenization of classes. Classes just don't feel as unique as they used to. 2) Threat. I enjoyed the old system.
---
Well, the fact that you're bringing up a delay for unnecessary reasons and saying that you won't 'mind' one just made me think that you're going as far as to ask for it.
---
you're\*
---
Don't worry, we have a lot of pserver players around here that didn't even know how it was back in the days and spamming #NoChanges. Do they really think we will get a 1:1? Its Classic WoW and not Vanilla. I would love to see the options to choose old and new models. As long they don't touch the gameplay and keep the social aspect in it.
---
When they don´t get a lot of new subs there is no reason for new content as players are already paying for the product. It depends on how many fresh players get into their nets. And when the numbers of the new players start to decline we may get new content in some way.
---
Good thing you remembered how to be an ass.
---
I've seen people advocate for delays hundreds of times in video games if it results in a more polished game
---
Cynicism is often a result of wisdom. This is Activision we are talking about.

Any one ever thought of servers akin to diablo 3 seasonal server wipes only on a longer timescale?

I want exactly this. A beautiful looking azeroth with the old game system.
---
Only started playing in december '06, so please bear with a possibly stupid question.
---
In the 1.6.0-patchnotes it says:
---
&gt;Honor system reward items with a rank requirement will now require a lifetime "highest rank" of that rank, rather than requiring the character to currently have the required rank. 
---
* So if I get to be 'Knight Gharax' and after that fall back to private, I could still use my bought necklace, cloak and so on, but what about the non-item-rewards like 10% discount on goods and repairs or access to the officer's barracks?
---
* Could I still display the title knight after falling back to private or only the one I actually have, if at all?
---
I think it's cute that you think the fortnite bfa LFR crowd will make it to level 60 let alone raid. They will give when they can't dps nuke groups in deadmines while trying to chain pull.
---
Personally I'm all for horizontal progression. More quests, more places to explore, more challenging content and interesting gear. That's what I want to see classic become
---
They've explained why its not an easy job.  
---
The eninge that was used in Vanilla, is a different engine they use for current / retail.
---
Because they want to have it running on the today's engine, they have to convert everything from  the old engine to the new engine.
---
The benefit to have it running on the current engine, is that once that is complete, yuo dont need 2 teams supporting 2 different engines. 1 big team, supports the current engine, therefore classic an Retail.
---
Also if i remember correctly, the old engine had truobles supporting x86 and Apple envoirements.  
---
The retail engine does not, which makes it an logical choice to convert it to the newest engine.
---
So stating that its taking so long, because its already made in 2004, is just nonesense, and shows you dont have any knowledge of game development.
---
I'd rather hang out with lonely older folk than edgy teens and young adults tbh. At least erp-ers mostly stay in one place.
---
Lots of people ask what's the best race / class combo for leveling or once you get to the end. But I wonder, what is the WORST possible start to the game in every aspect if you want to have the hardest time with everything?
---
Alchemy makes gold hand over fist. Been grinding toward 5mill by playing for 30 -45 mins a day going just alch and ah. Once classic hits I'm turning it into game time and retiring to classic forever.
---
Vanilla had dark nights... They changed that in Cata I think
---
3 Russians in the back of a garage can make a wow private server. Blizz is a multi billion dollar company and it’s taken them longer than 3 construction workers on a Windows 95. Atleast their version won’t have a wow token.
---
It’s definitely a reasonable method, just not the be all, end all of warrior levelling like certain people make out
---
A level 20 mage in classic will have more spells than a 80 mage in live.
---
They changed from dark to light to even darker* https://amp-reddit-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8r74y0/comparison_nights_in_retail_and_vanilla/?usqp=mq331AQECAEoAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1

This made me, litteraly, cry.
---
RIP Legacy of Kain remake.
---
Preach. 
---
Deffo want Human/ orc wep skill facials IMO. The dagger thing is interesting, I think it’s easier to find a reliable sword/ axe so probably not worth it, unless you have another char to gear your warrior.
---
lmao no shit. Try 80% Then by the time you finished eating you got 2 more spawns to deal with.
---
I'm using Numpad )
---
This post gets created at least 2 times a day, and for the 10000000th time: no
---
Yeah, Blizzard can set up a shit private server overnight. They're not making a private server. They're making WoW classic. They're putting the 1.12 models, textures, data into the current client. It's unprecedented. It's going to introduce a wave of new bugs that need ironing out.
---
.. Do you not think if Blizzard could have the product out making money already they wouldn't? They're not just going to shit out a server list and call it a day.
---
A fullblown sand storm first time I rode into Tanaris, and seeing snow for the first time in Dun Morogh doing the wetlands run. The snow absolutely blew me away.
---
Since I was an FPS player before WoW I used WASD movement and had keybinds for all spells and attacks ^^
---
I sucked though
---
Yeah, for a *separate game*. The whole point of Classic is to bring back Vanilla because it became unavailable because of all the changes (expansions).
---
It's obviously not retail when it's classic lol
---
I roll need on stuff for “offspec” that no one else needs and then I vendor it after.
---
My offspec is goblin.
---
I really enjoy all the quirks and fun abilities that frost mages have, like conjure food, blink, blizzard.
---
However i think raiding and dungeons will be quite dull as a mage!
---
Just don't get a quest add-on. Vanilla wow does not tell you what to do. You have to read the quest text to figure out what the hell you have to do and doing that will make you feel the story and lore. Ive had friends with max level toons that don't even know what wow is about because they accept wuest and instantly looked at map where to run.
---
You can still Google if you are lost with something but if you do so you already read everything. It's a really please try experience. (I would still recommend turning fast quest texts on otherwise you can't accept fast enough if somebody shares a bunch of quests in a dungeon since you will be marked as 'busy')

Even so, the trauma is real and I hate this place even w/o going there for years lul
---
You're the hero we need, but not deserve!
---
I have my heart set on Gnome rogue for obvious reasons but due to work shifts I often can't make raid times for guilds etc. This has been an issue in retail before but I always manage to gear through pugs and M+
---
Do you think I will have an issue with gearing etc or should I choose a class which is better suited to more casual and solo content  or one which requires less gear to be decent ?
---
If so what?
---
Generally, yes, if the rogue is a reasonable person.
---
Shadowcraft isn't BIS for rogues or ferals (not 100% sure on ferals, correct me if I'm wrong), so it comes down to who needs it the most based on their current gear. 
---
Remember that this isn't current WoW where you'll never see that guy again, so talking about it and seeing who'd get the most out of it is good for your reputation.
---
it's not classic if it looks retail :)
---
&gt; I kind of wish they do
---
You think you do, but you don't.

Teleportation shrinks the world and is an important part of what changed the WORLD of Warcraft into just a "lobby game".

Just use 15 Enh Shamans instead of Warriors and stormstrike everything 😏
---
Pro tip: Get used to open your spell book to give leveling players smaller ranks of your buffs (but the highest possible).

It is little effort but the payout is many times bigger!

If my warcraft lore is correct I'm pretty sure blood elves are the high elves.

So much this. BRD was like a proper city, and it felt immersive and genuinely dangerous.
---
Realistically, if we were a band of adventurers going into some dungeon, it wouldn't be this singular path leading you all the way through past each boss to the end, like you get in retail dungeons.
---
BRD left you to explore, and go to the places you wanted. So many different aspects of the city.

Simple question: How easy will it be getting a raid spot (guild/pug) for a frost mage (Alliance) versus a Dwarf Priest (Healing)?
---
How do those two measure up against a Resto Druid? Limited players but also limited raid spots.

So a true vanilla launch? Sign me up!

Hmm does that really check out? Do you have something to backup the shrinking of azeroth?

(Unfortunately I had to wait 24h for the first post)
---
I know how youre feeling, cause I was in the same spot as you with my own brother. I was like around 15 or 16 back then and I've played also for hours in our beloved world including farming, raiding, doing pvp and all stuff like that. Always my brother at my side. At the weekends when I deeply played into the night and wasn't able to get up early in the morning, my brother had taken the chance to play for a few hours and did some pvp action or collecting/farming stuff. It was a great time remembering that with my brother. Our parents couldnt unterstand that at all ofc.
---
Now, when it comes to the release, we will play together. We cannot wait for it, its a feeling I just cant describe, only thinking about that gives me goosebumps. It's like you already said, it has such a deep meaning. And I'm saying this at my 30s, but we're never getting to old for this boys! Wishing you guys all the best, cya around! :-) (Sorry for my bad english, I hope you guys got me)
---
Pugging MC will definitely be a thing so you should be fine. You'll just have to compete on open rolls with all the other rogues but thats the same for all classes in pugs
---
You seem thouroghly confused. Let me try to help you. You can level a character from 0-120 in the retail game (what you call normal). Or you can wait for classic and level a character from 0-60. The two leveling experiences will be vastly different. 
---
Over the years in retail, every aspect of the game has changed including the leveling experience from 0 and up. Biggest change is it will be a lot faster and streamlined and you will not have much social interaction along the way. Lots of the world from 0- 110 is basically a wasteland now. 
---
Classic will be as the game was from the beginning more or less. It means slower leveling but much more social interaction. Also everyone will be starting at level zero so you'll be interacting with tons of people your level. When you reach 60 there are tons of end game content and epic gear to get so you won't be bored.
---
In short, if you want to play the latest content from blizzard. Get a boosted character starting at 110 and play the latest content up to 120. If you want to experience wow as it was and have a fun leveling experience, wait for classic.
---
I actually get second-hand stressed when I see people setting goals that take this level of commitment. Including the 35% of this sub who thinks they’ll get rank 14. Don’t do it guys! Be realistic! Be happy with some epics!
---
Meh, i want the chat spam, it made me feel like there are actually other people.
---
I was all set on Dwarf Holy Priest but now I’m leaning towards Human Holy Paladin. I’d like to raid and PvP so I’m thinking Paly is the better fit?
---
The problem with double gathering professions is that he's locking himself out of engineering, which is a beast profession for both PvE and PvP, and from a min/max perspective is basically mandatory on a Warrior.
---
On the tbc private server I'm currently on it's automatic. However it also downranks my renews. Was that the case in vanilla (can't remember) and when yes why? I understand that a level 9 with a 50 stamina buff would be it okay and for that reason they only can review lower buffs. But heals? Why that?
---
We already know it won't come Q2 and it will come in summer.
---
I dont play either, go back to your bubble thinking blizzard will not scale their game.
---
There is a reason they title it Classic and not Vanilla, it's themed around Vanilla nothing more than that.
---
I was expecting this :D
---
I like this logic "it will never be 100% the same", is this some kind of a ticket to implementing bullshit? Also tokens don't prevent shit, its just blizzard getting a piece of the cake. People that buy gold already know where to buy it from, and tokes just help scared people.
---
I forgot that over the 100,000 people that played on Nost played a shit private server. All private servers are shit even though blizz asked nost for help. Blizzard explicitly changed the engine for a cash shop. You didn’t need to convert shit to the new client. See you in the next post when you’re defending blizzards decision to add a wow token to classic.
---
Graffics and textures maybe.
---
Models and animation nope.
---
I never see ‘STV’ without thinking Scottish Television.
---
It's ok for people to get bored...new people will show up. New players should be able to play the original just like everybody else before them.
---
Every single thread people keep asking the same question. ''Will i get a raid spot as X class and specc''. The answer is yes, you'll find a raid as pretty much everything without any effort except the ''meme'' specs. There will be tons of guilds needing spots filled, so just pick an archetype you enjoy and go with that.
---

Technically they retrofitted the new client to work with old source and database.
---

---
Was the title a series question or an attempt at click bait?
---
Yes, you can kill players from the opposing faction in Classic.
---
Thousands of players played Anthem, doesn't mean it wasn't an unfinished, broken mess. Nost was great as far as privates go but it was still incomplete and inaccurate because *all private servers are*.
---
They're changing to the new client for the reasons listed in the post below mine, for battlenet integration. Anything else is pure tinfoil hat speculation on your behalf, that's on you. Considering you're on this sub I'm guessing you're still going to be paying Blizzard. See you in classic without a cash shop.
---
Thinking you can tell the world your exact location and don't expect people to show up is ignorant.
---
Its a PvP server.
---
I advise streamers to play on PvE servers.
---
And yes, ofcourse its allowed. Its fun to do even. Killing a guy while getting a life reaction is fun.
---
I have my Nost t-shirt ready to wear when that sweet release hits.
---
Chromie
---
Kinda why most my mog outfits are from vanilla and bc. Blizzard  hadn't got balls to the wall on tier sets yet. Things could be toned down and still be pretty sweet looking.
---
Well let me respond to the master coder that most likely works at Denny’s. Nostralis already produced a private server that ran on the client they just didn’t have information that only blizz has in regards to specific stats on mobs. Over 100,000 played on Nos with the old engine. Blizz just wants to add a cash shop to the game. They fired all their GMs and they’re explicitly updating the game files with updated shop and token. They’re adding a cash shop and it’s Blizzards greed that made them update to the new client.

It restores 60 energy on use and they don't share cooldown. So you can use that trinket + tea to restore a total of 160 energy, with an 8 second stunlock you can use
---
340 energy. 255 energy for raw damage and 85 energy for the stunlock.  If you time it well just before an energy tick, you have 360 energy to use, 275 energy for raw damage.
---
That's quite hard hitting shit right there.

No, I’m saying it’s pretty damn hard to farm the thousands of gold to get all the BoE items that are BiS for warriors. It’s even harder to farm that much gold on warriors.
---
Honest question:
---
What's so bad about keyboard turning and backpaddling? I do it all the time.
---
I understand that in certain situations you have to mouse turn (like casting in PvP) and of course I do that but if I'm just running on autorun I love to use my character with a and d. I understand that using s to go backwards is less time efficient than just running straight back using your mouse but as a healer i like to do it if things get close(not when I get aggro) since I can still see everything and do my job while slowly retreating.
---
Am I missing a big point here or is it just frown upon because most people who do that exclusively then do that?
---
As I said I of course use my mouse to turn my character in a tense setting but I don't see why using the keyboard is so bad if the situation does not require it.

Hello, I have never played classic but very much look forward to it. I would like to play a class that can play multiple roles, not just pure dps. My top 2 are paladins and druids since I want to be alliance and don't really feel for priests. Quite undecided on pala vs druid. Paladins have good utility but I fear they might grow stale, as a dps you mostly auto attack and as a healer you spam your flash of light to no end.
---
Druids have more options to deal damage, they can even tank and while they only use healing touch I hear almost all of its ranks are useful. One concern is skill floor, druids seem to be much harder to play both as a healer due to long casts and in pvp due to powershifting and such. But hey maybe thats a good thing, allways something to improve upon. 
---
Any recommendations on druids vs paladins?
---
Disagree heavily with this. If someone has feral as their main spec then they should need on whatever feral gear they want no matter what spec they're in at the time.
---
As long as you can turn it off. Would be really annoying respeccing at 60 to have to click "ya sure?" 51 times
---
Nope. Do it carefully and understand why you choose a talent point instead of copying a build from the internet and you will make no mistake
---
That is a big stretch even for me and I know how much they like their dollars.
---
High elves still exist and were in vanilla. Most of them did turn into Blood elves, though.
---
How useful is a combo of a raiding mage/sometimes PvP with Tailoring and Enchantment? or should I be better going herb/alch?
---
Play a priest. Make friends with the enemy faction. MC PW:F will save you from being ganked.
---
Fully intend to be past STV within the first week. It will belong to us hunters.. and warlocks, and a few other players.

r/brandnewsentence
---
This is one of a few items in Vanilla that has cryptic/misleading text to describe what it does, when you use the charm it just gives you 60 energy back; so, if you are at 10 it'll put you at 70 but if you are at 70 it'll just put you at 100, not 130. They do not share a cooldown and both of these items are good for creating a burst window. Hope this helps!
---
I did to but to poor hordies.  
---
So annoying when the little kitten tries to harm you while buffing then.  I mean a lv60 vs a lv30 your at risk of getting a dot from me if you don’t stop trying to hurt me while I’m buffing you. 
---
Then when we meet at lv60 you will not suspect me of throwing you down in the lava on the chain until it’s to late.
---
34 isnt old hah

i bet a lot if not most ppl are actually expecting this and gonna be very dissapointed to realize how barebones in features mmos was back then

[https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1109832561704878081](To be clear, we have no philosophical opposition to setting up a Classic RP-PvP server. But our priority is making sure servers have long-term healthy populations, so we'll start with lean realmlists and expand as needed, just as the 2004 launch did.)

No because I'm 99.99% sure there won't be an Oceanic RP server.

How is that an argument ?

Sure, and the benefits i've just writen here above ? just ignoring that part ?

Your reasoning is so clouded, you cant even argue normally.

its almoust pathethic.

And the week after the next week, and the week after, and for the rest of your life.
---
i have 4 kids, are you suggesting i dont have time for wow?! you MAKE time for classic!
---
Maybe, maybe not... If blizzard are careful, they will (hope not) eventually give TBC, but if they aren't careful, they might split the community too thin, eventually killing both. Lets see how many people will be there 1 year after release. Then again if blizzard go for short term profit, we're all screwed.
---
Lol as if Classic hasnt alwasy been Blizzards plan B. Considering the fact that Blizzard has been bleeding players for years now, it was just a matter of time before they would make Classic.
---
Wirt's Third Leg
---
I honestly think this is a wildly overblown misconception: Will of the Forsaken has a relatively long cooldown and won't be available for every single encounter (especially in a bg where you'll be engaging constantly). If you fear someone and they WotF you have a ton of counter-play in the form of death coil, net-o-matic if you are an engineer, etc. And once their Will has expired you can freely fear them. Alliance Warlock is just fine, you just have to be aware when you are fighting vs Undead players.
---
Yes bandage the priest and he will be WTF?????

no, hard pass. Stupid idea. Dont listen to this guy, blizzard! These kind of ideas fucked over the game in the first place

Too much Copper Ore on the Auction House is FAR worse than people not being able to play at all, or too many servers which later end up empty. I completely agree.

How do you think it works when you buy it from third parties if it's not literally the same thing?
---
All the physical classes are strong in the earlier part of the game because casters have no hit. 
---
Hunters decline the most
---
All the caster classes get better because of the increased availability of spell hit %
---
It's both honestly, it's what my guild does, and plans on doing.. On netherwing a few of us got banned for it. 
---
Acording to BFA rules, streamsniping is a no-go. I was hoping with a little OC I can reach out, and get a better answer.
---
90% of the buffs aren't the same or don't exist anymore.
---
I am jacked to roll a hunter. All I need is my bow!
---
Yea I guess firing 80% of the GMs will allow that whopping 20% to ban the gold sellers. I guess that updating cash shop files and not removing the will be totally fine. I guess that complete radio silence from Blizz about the wow token is a good thing. What a crazy conspiracy there is with them adding the token and cash shop. It’s not like there’s a bunch of evidence that I listed above.
---
as paly you can atleast pvp in that sweet sweet plate armor.
---
skinning is annoying as f as there are so many things to skin but noone ever loots their shit
---
My first instinct was to say that might just be a private server oversight, but thinking back I do seem to recall that maybe being a thing, at least for a while before being patched out.
---
When you've been running the same raids since 2006 with the same specs those argumetns fade away dude
---
THis isn't a progression server
---
On a "live" server you never know what's coming. So you would give hunters slots in a 40 man on the off chance they become the best DPS in teh game via patch.
---
That is not gonna happen here lol
---
Holy Priest and Frost Mage is vital for any raid group. 1-2 druids is enough. no one will have to struggle to find a raid group however. I would think due the the amount of Frost Mages that class will have the hardest time.
---
I think OP means there should be a confirmation window when closing the talent tree. So you lay out your talents like you want and then lock them in with a button. Something like that.
---
lol no
---
did we have repair bots in vanilla?
---
I think people ask because there is alot of interest in Blizzard continuing development of classic. 
---
I for one would rather see classic go its own path than doing every expansion after eachother and woopsie daysie we are back at shit wow again.
---
There is tons of planed vanilla content never released because TBC came around. I would love to see new made content with classics view of making them.
---
Heck some where almost finished even
---
As a more hardcore oriented player I would say that Engineering is mandatory for achieving the full depth of Classic. In PVP you gain access to additional damage, crowd control, movement speed, and even the ability to reflect harmful spells; in PVE you gain access to AoE damage (which most classes lack in the earlier expansions), you also gain access to trinkets like Arcanite Dragonling and the Battle Chicken that increase your raid's overall damage by buffing party members / debuffing the raid bosses. I would highly recommend not skipping out on Engineering, and honestly I don't know why you would even want to skip out on it for the minor convenience of a free profession slot.
---
I don't think I like rogues anymore... :(
---
Quicker announcement
---
I don't personally think that this is the reason, but I am definitely a proponent for at least 1 RP-PVP server at launch. I think it will be more popular than some suspect. I believe Blizzard will come to agree and we will see an RP-PVP realm when they are ready to talk about servers in general.
---
I hope they do it the wotlk way with a *setting* to require confirmation for your whole tree. Not per point like some people are imagining.
---
No, respeccing would be terrible
---
Stop being bad
---
People only don't like them because it's slower movement for pvp and maybe raids imo
---
There is always spam in the chat xD
---
Will the servers b in a locked vanilla state forever or is there any kind of progression planned? I mean I am not sure if they know themselves yet so I don't think we will get any information about that but that would be nice. For example some people surely want to progress to tbc, I personally don't. However some class modifications done in tbc would still be nice in vanilla. I personally would love horizontalal progression and IF they chose to release tbc than as a opt in copy character to new server like thing but still that would maybe kill the old server. 
---
Horizontal progression (new vanilla content) would be by far the best option but really curious what they plan on doing
---
Almost as pathetic as your spelling
---
it makes black lotus a yellow tier instead of orange i believe
---
...paladins can insta cleanse poisons and have 10k armor in t3 lol
---
The optimal for PvP/PvE would be tailoring / engineering.
---
Enchanting? Only good if you get the rare enchants early on.
---
I would suggest herb/alch for an alt.
---
Change my mind is strong cause you can't come up with an argument to change their mind lol
---
Pedophobe safe haven

These full melee gear Enhancement gear setups are going to give players a bad impression of the reality of playing Enhancement. You are still a utility class, and your #1 job on raids is to totem twist. Without a mix of melee gear and caster gear you're going to have a lot of trouble with totem uptime. Additionally it's going to be very difficult for you to obtain items like Truestrike Shoulders and Puissant Cape over the other pure DPS characters in your raid. They're hard enough to obtain for the pure DPS folk.
---
This is where reliance on damage meters can hurt yourself and your raid. If being able to totem twist properly lowers your personal DPS by 100 and increases the DPS of the other 4 people in your group by 50 each, you end up at a net negative DPS but those kinds of things can be difficult to see in a DPS meter.
---
Hunter's job - be a defense bitch abuse tracking/traps. Delay/control
---
Shaman - Fight mid, blow ur load with chain lightning then totem and heal
---
Druid - specialist that flag carries in WSG and defends caps in AB
---
Misclicks happen. It has nothing to do with copying builds. But let's be honest, this game is 15 years old. Everyone will be copying builds.
---
Retail still has no Mark of the Wild, Paladin buffs are completely different, food and water can just be gievn by 1 click and you have 4 full stacks.
---
The only buffs that still exist as in Vanilla are AI, Fort, Battle Shout.  Except all of these now give 10% of a base stat instead of a flat numeric value. Shout also now gives AGI.
---
They did not get it right.
---
I'm pretty sure that Theramore is still available
---
I play on pservers and am still a clicker.  What's the major drawback of clicking? Tbh I don't get how the alternative to clicking is done.
---
Is there any good indications if more people will go horde or alliance overall?
---
Straight into WoD
---
excuse me for my spelling.  
---
English isnt my 1st language, but my 2nd/3th.  
---
Also typing from a phone, so excuse me :)
---
Seeing that you are not replying to quotes/questions, but attacking me on my grammar just ended the discussion.
---
Good luck growing up, but it seems you are doing just fine , acting like a 12 year old, on the internet.
---
So much this
---
Lordaeron
---
about engineering will be hard to get them ores...
---
The herb/alch alt is sure a thing.
---
I hope nothing happends after phases and naxx and the game just stays like that.
---
Lvl 120 takes a lot shorter time to reach than lvl 60 in vanilla
---
Thats not why. You get rage starved and do very bad damage. A debuff slot wont be an issue when we get 16 instead of 8
---
Its so easy to say "like OSRS" isn't it? But doesn't seem like you can tell me how they should do it. Tell me if you know why vanilla content was relevant. Ill give a hint.
---
Bad balance.
---
Horrid itemization.
---
Heavy RPG aspect.
---
Tell me how is Blizzard a team that consist of people that have nothing to do with the developers form 2004 and their vision. How can the recreate everything about that without risking breaking everything?
---
It will require them to basically work on 2 MMOS, and the chance for us to see the ToC/IC effect is too big. I mean the WotLK patch that introduced ToC and IC dungeons, you remember? The moment 80% of the game turned pointless and braindead easy.
---
Im not attacking you, just wondering how do you propose blizzard can apply the OSRS treatment and succeed. Do we know how a totally different game succeeded? Why is OSRS compared to WoW in the first place? Are people actually happy with the changes in OSRS? What happens if over time the people who are voted down when it comes to content, decide to ask for "vanilla realms, because they didn't like the changes that accumulated in the past 2 years"
---
Do you know what OSRS actually is, or you just read that it's a thing and came here guns blazing, thinking it will work for WoW?
---
Im interested to hear your opinion on this, So many things can break, and you compare OSRS with a game that is million times more famous than OSRS. 
---
Do you trust Blizzard enough, do you trust the player base? The year is 2019, how do you keep the game from turning into a playground for the "instant gratification people" which are majority? These people don't care about OSRS, but they are and will always be the majority when it comes to hyped games, which includes WoW. Do you give them the OSRS "Voting" rights? 
---
My opinion&gt;your opinion, thats all that will happen, ending in disaster for classic. Better throw around server restarts or open fresh servers. I came for classic not to VOTE for eventual changes. If i wanted to vote, id go into politics.
---
um, we DO know... It's absolutely nothing
---
I usually enter moonbrook around level 16 so it's not really all too hard to conquer.
---
Personally, the only acceptable and feasible way for a progression would be new servers, vanilla-locked for about 6 months and the progress to TBC. Those new servers, however, should have the option to either move or copy your vanilla progress to those servers. You shouldn't be forced to re-level your existing character. But you can also not "progress" the original vanilla servers because that'd make super many people angry. That's why a move or copy would be the best option. Not having that option would also mean player losses because many won't do the whole leveling thing again.
---
More like bored at home with no job.
---
you are not my king yet boy
---
This is why they won't add new content and leave Classic as it was forever:
---
"The new content is not like Classic WoW anymore, we demand Classic Classic Servers".
---
They don't want to deal with that anymore, they specifically said they don't want to maintain two MMOs simultainously.
---
Well, then do it VERY carefully :p
---
Seeing his remains as a mangled rib cage was a bit disturbing for 10 year old me

I would love that Feature since I´m actually missclicking sometimes :O
---
Definitely, just don't try it twice.
---
Try to run away, pull a bear
---
What is stv?
---
Respeccing would be terrible because you'd have 52 clicks instead of 51? A bit over dramatic don't you think?
---
Everyone and their mother is rolling mage/warrior/hunter/rogue. If you want an easy spot in raids I'd suggest not choosing those classes. Dwarf priests usually get a spot very reliably. If you can do feral or resto druid really well you'll be auto invited *every* raid.
---
If your "evidence" is that Blizzard have been quiet about something, then shit, I guess we can confirm sharding 100% of the time since Blizzard has been so quiet about that. Guess we can confirm a bunch of things because Blizzard hasn't said anything yet. You got anything to back up that there 80% statistic?
---
Paladin:
---
- Paladins can tank dungeons, but cannot tank raids. 
---
- Retribution spec is considered quite poor, and there's a big risk that even casual guilds will look badly on retribution paladins.
---
- Holy, paladins are crazy good healers and will likely be in quite high demand..
---
Druid
---
- Bear tank is strong (though some vanilla fanatics still believe only warriors can tank so get ready for some non-believers)
---
- Feral DPS can work but you need to invest alot of time to make it work.
---
- Moonkin DPS is considered one of the worst DPS specs
---
- Resto druid is considered the worst healer of the 4 healers, but you'll be fine in dungeons and even in raids you still have a few spots (usually 2-3)
---
So what's the conclusion?
---
Well, take the above into consideration, but as a new player I would listen mostly to what fantasy attracts me the most.
---
I don't think this is rocket science I am trying to explain here.
---
A bunch of people raiding a capital trying to kill the leader and people trying to stop them is PvP. Right?
---
A level 60 hunter with an epic mount patrolling the edge of the other faction's noob zone ganking anyone who tries to take their first step into contested territory is PvP. Right?
---
Nobody has to like both those thing just because they like one of them. They are both PvP. But people with multiple functioning brain cells are capable of subdividing the idea of "PvP" into subcategories which they have different opinions about.
---
Mrgl, mrgl, mrgl!!!
---
You and thousands of other people all have you own separate ideas for post-naxx content. Odds are you won't be happy with what they pick
---
Both are great. As a vanilla shaman I can say I hated Paladins the most out of all classes. Their utility belt felt so unfair.
---
They should just name the servers after some of the players or guilds who achieved game firsts during the original vanilla wow; that way they are immortalized into lore in some way while we pay tribute to those who came before us.
---
Lmao that panic when you realize hamstring isn't on your bars and you already pulled. 
---
Thanks for the timestamp.
---
Irish?
---
It’s virtually impossible to be weapon skill capped while levelling, so having AI leads to good DPS dividends from lvls 1 through 60

I was server and forum famous on Magtheridon for camping players months on end in Hellfire Peninsula during TBC.  Presumably reported numerous times, and had several accounts of players spending weeks in the zone unable to progress.  Even still, never recieved any sort of warning of GM intervention.
---
Times have changed, but as I understand it PvP is still an ingame problem that requires ingame solutions (ask guild for help, leave the area, use invisibility potions, play on PvE server, etc.).  The grey line where ganking turns into harrassment is up to Blizzard.  Assuming you're not spamming emotes, attempting to communicate with them, and leave them alone if they're in an area where PvP is disabled, such as a major city, then you should be fine.

The way he described it it would be 102 clicks.
---
Okay so here’s my struggle:
---
I’ve been completely torn between mage and priest for weeks. 
---
Im sure Ill enjoy the dungeon and raid gameplay as a priest, because I enjoy healing, it’s a very active and rewarding experience imo.
---
However Im not as much looking forward to leveling as a priest.
---
The mage class fantasy appeals more to me, the cool and fun quirks and abilities like blink, polymorph, conjure food etc. I think leveling will be more fun as a mage due to the more active mob fighting. Also pvp as a mage will be hella fun imo. (Something i believe i will enjoy less as a priest) On the other hand I think spamming frostbolt in dungeons and raids is a bit of a dull thing to do. 
---
Soo im still waiting for that one thing, sentence or argument that’ll help me decide and relieve me from this identity crisis ;)
---
Thanks in advance
---
Well with this tool the only think that will be spammed in chat would be nonsense. Now at least i can actually "feel" like there are people talking about game related stuff, rather than who won the 2020 elections.
---
Psychology. Seeing people looking for other people, makes for a better immersion than scrolling in some tool menus, like looking for a job in a newspaper...
---
It's easy to play Captain Hindsight but if flying was locked to Netherstorm, perhaps Blades Edge and Shadowmoon Valley in TBC, and Icecrown and Stormpeaks for WotLK it could have been a really cool extra mechanic rather than a new way of life.
---
NS, IC and SP make total sense to fly around, no doubt.
---
They're grossly overrated as you'll come to find out in Classic.
---
Meh, I can do badly drawn dicks in other games
---
They are remaking a 15 year old game for their fans and that isn't good enough because it doesn't cater to your specific needs? That makes them dumb as shit? Get the fuck outta here.
---
&gt; This argument has been proven time and time again to not work in game design, even more so multiplayer ones. You can't give people a "solve all your problems" tool and then just tell them not to use it. As a game designer it's your task to ensure that the game is fun by default, not only with arbitrary self-imposedlimitations.
---
You're presenting this as some kind of proven, eternal truth. But lots of people here insist that one of the great things about vanilla WoW is that you *can* noodle around doing pointless things if you like. They think it is a strength, not a weakness. They like arbitrary, self-imposed goals and limitations.
---
&gt; It's literally not group PvP. Nothing enforces it to be. Putting arbitrary rules like "not possible/fun with less than X people" when people can join and leave at any time without a group/queue'ing system is flat out non-functional.
---
Nothing forces it to be group PvP, except the fact that you can't do it without a group? Oooookay...
---
&gt; That's not adapting. That's just dealing with being a third-rate citizen who doesn't matter and trying your best to at least find some entertainment in the off-corners of the game.
---
I used an on-line translator. It says that "dealing with being a third-rate citizen who doesn't matter and trying your best to at least find some entertainment in the off-corners of the game" is butthurt-speak for adapting.
---
&gt; "Either you deal with being a third-rate citizen or shut your whining you crybaby."
---
Want some more whine for your pity party?
---
102 clicks where half of them is me hitting the same button over again to see the same message 50 times in a minute...
---
Well, sharding won't save the servers from death. Never saved and never intended to. At least in the way you mentioned.
---
I tend to think that the classical system of direct queue to the server will protect these servers longer. Because then more people go to less populated servers. In the case of sharding, there will be fewer live servers because it will allow more people to stay on hyped servers.
---
Saving this comment. same question here. Also torn between the two classes!
---
Not sure on that one but i know she uses A LOT of weird mods. lol
---
So a few months ago a Dota 2 custom game called auto chess came out and was such a success that twitch ended up making a twitch channel for auto chess specifically. Something tells me that classic wow will be getting the same treatment.
---
I'm still stuck not knowing which healer I'm going to main for raiding.
---
Paladins seem cool cause it's simple but the leveling sucks. It also locks me into Alliance which I'm not sure I want.
---
Shamans seem like the pretties girl at the ball but totems seem more complicated in vanilla and seems like a raid will probably have 8 shamans if they can bring 8.
---
Druids seem really cool, fast leveling, seems like they'd not have a hard time farming, but like Paladin would lock me into Alliance because I'm not playing a cow. They also seem like the ugliest girl at the ball, as I'm to understand they dont heal for much and raids only bring 1-3 for MotW, Bres, and Innervate for better healing classes.
---
Priest seems kind of meh, but I've never played one. I like that they use cloth gear so you're kind of building up towards your pre raid gear easier. But they seem the most complicated of the healers.
---
Rogues are from fresh 60 to naxx one of the best DPS classes, they are also one of the absolute best PvP classes.
---
In what area is a rogue "grossly overrated"? Mass PvP? maybe, but not really. Focus on healers and the battle turns.
---
This is just arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
You can also not get an MMO with the classic WoW mindset, which is what some people wish for in asking for continuation after Naxx.
---
Not saying this opinion is right and yours is wrong or vice versa, but I fully understand hoping Classic takes off and has blizzard rethink their design philosophy, however unlikely that may be.
---
It is not all of my time off, we do things together daily but we both travel for work so my month that im on vacation she will be gone the entire time anyway, the losing a fiance thing isnt even close to being an issue, just humor.

Link is a survey with 10000 datapoints.
---
If you plan on going PvP realm then priest is going to be played ALOT less than mage. Mages and priests generally have the same amount of raidspots so from that data it will be easier get into raids by playing priest.
---
Druid seems like it's going to be over represented compared to raidspots (usually 2-3 spots for druids in raid).
---
Miss click —&gt; pay!
---
i'm rolling a hunter so i intend to be there pretty quick :D cant wait to get a pet gorilla and name it after my IRL friend who is basically 90% gorilla, 10% matt damon
---
The solution here imo is to have certain servers frozen in time but allow others to progress through later expansions. There is a clear divide between people who want classic as a museum of one point in time and people who want it as a way to play through the entire game's history. Why not serve both groups?
---
easy... Easy.. EASY...
---
&gt;Aggro entire village
---
yea, our window of availability to take vacation didnt line up. She is taking 30 days in november while ill be working.
---
It took several years of consistent and proven interest in classic private servers for them to justify the risk.  I don’t know that TBC community can say the same.  Maybe it will be cost effective once you have a new player base, and they want to try the next thing, but maybe it would just be easier to spend these resource on retail where they will get no pushback for things like in game store items.
---
Disclaimer: "social" in this subreddit means killing, murdering and camping everything's red.
---
Quest mob queues are for the weak!
---
Well people can play whichever way they want but rushing to 60 without enjoying the way is a huge waste
---
That´s a crazy burst potential.
---
I'd play on Nihilum :D
---
Yeah you would need to buy mats from others. Then again you are playing a really good class for making lots of gold.
---
Jesus Christ this is next level ignorance
---
ROFL I know it's not a joke, but I still find it funny
---
If I see somebody put up MS on a boss fight, even with 16 slot you can be sure they're getting gkick. And in my experience arms just outputs more dmg when youre low on gear
---
You believe sharding will have a set amount of players at 20 or something? It's around a few hundred. You'll still have to semi-afk waiting for 20 minutes to kill that scorpion =)
---
Don't forget battle.net
---
This is why settings are great.
---
Dont need this, thanks.

&gt;I barely have any time and I’d be lucky to get to play 3hrs in a day.

That's about a 1/5th of your awake hours rofl

Your character is a gem. Keep him that way. Show ur kids that you were the bad ass rogue that every1 wanted to be

Shitty elitist attitudes like yours are why I unsubbed from here less than a month after classic was announced.
---
Let people enjoy things.
---
Uh no. Shaman is for the queer community. Sorry henny
---
That sweet 34.7 damage per second. I also used to choose armour that purely had a higher armour value because I didn't know what stats did.

Okay, thanks for your reply, it is very helpful. Luckily I have some time left to decide.

Kinda cool how there is 2 different moons one is worshipped by the night elves and the other one by the tauran.

Skip the bottleneck quests. You can make the same amount of xp by just killing a few extra boars.
---
I dont know what to tell you.
---
All 4 healer classes will be needed in raids. Druids is the most niche, but just as important as the others.
---
Group up with a druid and Paladin, Thorns and Retribution Aura!
---
That’s not what I said
---
Extremely dumb post. There will updates after Nax they talked about this many times and say it will die without new contact. So asking what direction they plan for this isn't a bad question
---
Quicker announcement for sure. Don’t care about the exact date, I just want to be able to plan vacation/time off.
---
You need to go away
---
A lot of people seem to miss this. All you need is enough people to fill up one server (two if you want pvp and pve) for each expansion, they'll get that EASY for the first three.

“ I’m not a gold farmer, I like to RAID and PVP”
---
Ok let’s get one thing straight, you will have to farm gold in order to raid, weather that be farm mats and farm blues to sell for gold, you WILL be farming some gold for raiding and pvp consumables
---
Wait didnt they already do this and its in the client as an option?
---
Chuck Norris but only Chuck Norris is allowed to play on it and he one shots every boss
---
How does a rogue have time to drink a cup of tea in the middle of combat. Smh
---
Well ... do both. That's what I'm doing. I'll be rolling a holy priest as my main to do PvE content with and a warlock as my alt for PvP and dungeons. Sounds like you'd like to do the same thing but with priest / mage. You could level whichever you felt like on any particular day when you logged on. 
---
Of course, this suggestion only works if you're casual and not in a hurry. If you're interested in getting to 60 quickly to hit the late-game content, then go priest. Use the mage as a PvP alt, which won't matter (in terms of rewards) until later phases.
---
https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
Almost 20000 datapoints indicating that Alliance will be a tiny bit more popular than Horde.
---
I'm hanging on Priest. I want to play Shaman as well, but the end-game learning curve for a first-time healer is probably going to be way too daunting for me. Druids are fun and really easy to level, but at the same time, I don't feel interested by their playstyle.
---
At the same time, I'm also quite torn if I want to play DPS, mainly mage, or just stick to playing priest. People will love me either way throughout levelling, it's just a matter of weighing the benefits and negatives for me.
---
This reminded me of the OG train which i totally forgot about
---
ALL ABOARD CHOO CHOOOOO
---
If you get a quest helper you are missing a big part of the social element if classic, group to figure out quests, ask for help...
---
Thats literally the point of addons so why would you include it in the game. Also: no changes.
---
Idk about that, me my friends and my former guild are only playing classic in hopes of progression to tbc, they can have realms progress and keep a few for former expansion to satisfy the need of those who like that specific expansion. In the long Run when ppl are bored with classic it Will pay off to go to Next expansion
---
Hey its me, wolf
---
Nope, I despise the new models and what they did to my female gnomes. They used to be cute, now they look emo and like they are detoxing from hard drugs. I can’t wait to see them again as they were before 8.0 forced me to use the horrible new models 😝😝😝😝
---
Yeah most progressive private servers never even make it to naxx lol
---
The burst power for a rogue with a strong dagger is insane. You can cheap shot, backstab, backstab, backstab, eviscerate IIRC.
---
If it all crits, you can take out a r14 Shaman just so.
---
Enchanting is a serious gold sink. A significant amount of the gold that you get when you level is from vendoring all of the greens / blues that you're not wearing. Enchanting takes that money stream from you. And it will only replace it in late game if you get a bunch of the rare enchants, which isn't likely unless you're really hardcore.
---
As the other commenter said, tailor / engineering is the most optimal way to go for PvP. A common way to approach this is to level as tailor / mining and save all of the mats to switch to tailor / engineering at 60. You can also just grind the gold to buy the mats off the AH. Really doesn't take that long to do once you hit 60.
---
You're friends with Matt Damon!?
---
i would be ok with it, if i knew the person who is applying it is pushing pvp ranks hard, and i dont use more than 8-12 slots anyway. And he can make up for it with consumes and more effort.
---
I want to know which private server is riddled with corpses in the Grell cave.
---
Well, depending what ui addon you use, you can do the macros ( these are literally like 5 seconds each ). Or you could use CLIQUE addon. With that you setup the mouse over heals in the spellbook.
---
Automatical healing addons wont work in classic, so healbot that automatically chooses a target or ranking of spell are NOT going to a thing in classic. You need to do it "manually" with mouseover stuff. Same thing with decurse / dispells.
---
A feral druids gameplay isnt slow by any means and many say a feral druid has the most involved fast paced dps rotations. As a druid in pvp you will find that you always have somthing to you can do and an answer to everything. It's incredibly fun to be able to play stealthy and switch things up and heal. The versatility and mobility of a druid makes them incredibly useful and fun to play in pvp. 
---
However their burst is pretty nonexistent. Even as a boomkin which I suppose would be their most bursty spec is really weak because of poor itemization. 
---
Playing a druid can be fast paced and you will find yourself constantly doing something. Wpvp is awesome and flag running is crazy strong. It certainly is an enjoyable class to pvp with. Leveling is also very efficient. 
---
But it sounds like you want more burst potential so I would reccomend a shaman. They can do much of what a druid offers with less mobility. They have more burst and offer great support in pvp
---
I totally get where you are coming from.
---
As a matter of fact you are wrong though :3
---
Nobody says hunters are weak or can´t compete in endgame. It is just a simple fact that other classes scale better than hunters´.
---
You can ofc disagree - I don´t really care to be honest :D But you will come to the realization that they are simply not the strongest class lategame.
---
Which doesn´t mean a good hunter can´t kill a good mage lategame and vice versa because it is of course skill reliant too. But just from a stats perspective - they do not get as much. 
---
You don´t even Need a lot of math to realize that. And don´t come with "different pets do different dps etc." pets have been testes - all - and the strongest ones have been found - even in retail vanilla^^
---
At least you realize how dogmatic you sound. I find it very arrogant to say "this game is not for you" ... I have played vanilla before, starting a few weeks after release and later on private servers as well. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to playing classic.
---
BUT:
---
Just because I like the game as a whole does not mean that I cannot see its flaws and dislike them. That does not mean in the slightest that I want the shit that is BFA. Why does everyone go there? Just because something sucks (imo) in vanilla, why should I go play BFA then? It's so egregious that everyone is so dogmatic about #nochanges ... this is a straight up fanaticism, all the downvotes people get for stating any opinion that deviates from it just proves it. I don't care about opinions, I care about arguments. Give me a good argument as to why a certain change would be bad and all is good. I used to like the idea of dual speccing in classic as well, but reasons as to what that might entail, regarding how the experience would change, changed my mind. But just preaching the same #nochanges and "with changes it's not classic" shit is not constructive at all.
---
You have not offended me. This kind of unreflected "argumentation" (I put it in quotes because usually there is no actual argument) just aggravates me.
---
Brb, need to change my pants 😤
---
I could take or leave cata but I'd love another shot at pandas, that was a fun expansion
---
I would love to see a bronze dragon flight theme for the servers to fit with the back in time theme set by the trailer with Chromie.
---
If you can't appreciate the majesty of the Tauren better stick to the alliance with the shiny,glowy, gnomy babies.
---
I love seeing an ally about to get killed because they pulled too many mobs. I'll sheep one, pull aggro on the other one, and frostbolt the other one so they can run away. Then we group up and teach those damn Defias a lesson they won't soons forgets.
---
I thought about pally too for a while but i simply cant handle the pally healing, doesnt fit my class fantasy. Also i heard the pally leveling is tough and im a casual
---
Quit your girlfriend?
---
Exactly. This guy doesn't get it.
---
Its easy to bitch on the question being asked again. But i think partly thats what this thread is for. I think its totally okay to ask anything related to the topic here. Its better that people come here than make seperate posts
---
The other commenter nailed it, but I wanted to emphasize their last point: it's the class fantasy that matters most in vanilla. You'll spend a lot of time with your character, so it's most important that you simply like your character. 
---
I can't tell you what to play, but ... play druid if you want to raid and have the option of filling multiple roles. Bears are solid off-tanks and resto is a good raid healer with the really useful ability to rez in combat. Yes, the skill floor is higher than the pally, but that seems like a positive to help keep you from getting bored from a one-button rotation.
---
Fuck that shit, give me sharding, thanks.
---
Not sure if I should be ashamed or not, but to be honest I really liked this video lol!!
---
The touch of humor you bring makes all the difference.
---
Some guys you fight really seem to be bots though ^^ (that priest at 5'10...)
---
priests are on par with mages when it comes to speed and ease of leveling
---
The most logical choice would be for it to end after wotlk since that's where the original story ends. And a lot of people seem to think that these  2 expansions were still good. I expect blizzard to eventually release tbc with an option to join and then if it continues to work for them to eventually release wotlk with an option to join as well. Sure it will split the community some but people are already happy playing on low pop private servers so I dont think people will quit just because the play pop goes down on individual servers. Plus they can then join old servers together to fix pop/faction balance issues
---
Tauren are cool, I just cant stand playing them. I played Horde exclusively through Vanilla to the end of WOTLK. Then I quit. Pretty much just played Troll and Orc ladies
---
Since this sub is all about fucking stupid memes, shouldnt it be like Servy McServerface ?
---
Yet we have actual cities instead of mud huts.
---
Casual guilds in Classic will be filled with older people with lots of RL responsibilities. You'll almost certainly be able to find one to play with that'll be happy to have you along when you can.
---
Some pretty solid arguments. Im not in a rush luckily, soo ill start off with a priest and then start my mage alt whenever I feel like it
---
Got my rank 13 on Boulderfist server human mage started Uni 2 weeks after so didn't continue the grind.
---
Basically wsg/ AB as soon as I logged in and logged out.
---
The PVP guild would cycle the guild leader after they hit rank 13/14 to allow other to achieve the same ranking.
---
So when it came to your turn you had to make a team/leader the premade yourself and try to micromanage the guild honor rankings among the members.
---
How do you come to that conclusion?  Everything I posted it accurate.  It's not an argument, it's just fact.
---
Go back to /r/WoW mate.
---
It's lvl 22 for 3/3 blizzard.
---
God, I envy you. Most of my friends want to roll Alliance.
---
I can’t stress how much I will be missing the amazing atmosphere of the undead, especially Brill. What do I have to settle for now... Lakeshire?! Meh.
---
&gt; everyone is still gonna download Questie as soon as it drops 
---
Not everyone.
---
yes 2k hp is easy to kill an a stun, but caster that try hard with pre raid gear can easly hit around 4k hp its not easy to kill that in blues pre raid gear.
---
A caster in bwl gear or even naxx gear sometimes wont have more then this, or very slim and cap out 4,5k or something with pve gear, and that is if we talking warlocks here. 
---
Allmost all "caster" can get hit from the skilltree to pvp fine.
---
Yes caster dmg gets alot of better later on the thats why mage scales super good in pvp, he gets the dmg and dosnt need the HP.
---
While Rogue dmg and mage dmg gets better and better, and most classes need to somehow live the first onslaught from this classes to have a fighting chance.
---
If you go near the "we are allmost naked" state of the game rogues are the super strong. But as soon ppl get abit of gear rogues falls of until they hit the mark where dmg gear outscales the stamina on gear.
---
Yeah, but there's less demand for Druids. Or rather there are less room for Druids in a raid compared to other healers. It's all I meant.
---
No, as a warrior you’ll accept my goddamn Paladin/Shaman party invite!
---
End-game shaman healing = drop totems and chain heal. If you like the shaman class fantasy, play it. You'll have a lot more fun.
---
Also remember that you have a *long* time while leveling to really learn your class, so you have tons of time to figure it out. Play what you want!
---
BFD has more quests for Horde and a flight path outside. Warriors, Rogues and Hunters should do it for the Outlaw Saber which is a Horde only quest.
---
I feel ya, I've been weighing the pros and cons for each healer for days now. I'm unlikely to roll a second healer alt. Probably gonna roll a mage or hunter so I can farm a bit easier.
---
Don't be bothered by him, you're certainly not the first one that he approached in this manner.
---
I remember a dwarf warrior with that ugly old T2 Helm from the only Guild that cleared Mc/Ony on the Server.
---
Damn, I thought that guy was a god.
---
There likely wont be a quest helper addon at launch since the old addons wont work and the new addons have all the shit fucked up by cataclysm.
---
What will it be set by then if not # of players in a closed area?
---
I mean, even with sharding you can stand around doing nothing for as long as you want if that's your thing. But when release day finally comes, I'd rather actually be playing the game I've been waiting 12 years for, thanks.
---
There are barely any rpg elements left in retail.
---
They can, but you can use rank 1 and let them cleanse it. 
---
I don't think there will be many people with T3 (especially not in the first 2 years). 
---
And with aspect of the cheetah paladins will never catch you. So the worst thing can happen is a draw. 
---
But I agree, out of the healers Palas are the hard counter for hunters. That's why I'm going to play Alliance this time.
---
Misleading. That zhevra has hooves
---
Bro you said mages don't scale when they have some of the best scaling in teh game and can pom pyro u....
---
You have no idea what you're talkiong about lol
---
I played ont he same server as monkey newz...Trust me
---
Yeah, it is literally right there in the message you quoted. He is specifically talking about RP-PvP servers (which currently looks unlikely), not RP servers in general (which there will be).
---
This isn't the first time I've seen this type of lying. You start by talking about RP servers in general, then when someone points out that there will be RP servers, you switch to talking specifically about RP-PvP, as if that is what you were always saying.
---
Also, what is "pure RP server" supposed to be? RP-PvE and RP-PvE are both RP servers, none of them more so than the other one.
---
Yep for sure.
---
Patchwerk... on a private server, first reset of naxx last week. We had 1 MT and 3 OT.
---
Yea but hes on Mars
---
If you're going to play Classic consistently for a while, you're almost certain to roll and alt anyway. Might as well plan for it. Nice part about rolling two clothies is the gear overlap. My priest will be a tailor and - except for a couple of BoP items at 60 - that means solid gear all through the leveling process for both characters.
---
How about some LFR too? Having to apply and prove yourself to get a raid spot is a way bigger drag than having to wait a bit to do a quest.
---
These are amazing!
---
Amazing. Make it english and ill buy 2 😀
---
Yes, if you can buy that shit now (and use them later), i would get them now. The price must jump quite a bit when classic launches.
---
This would be problematic for me, as I'm going back to school in September. A drop date in July would be great, as I will still be working so I would have more time to play.
---
My opinion:
---
Stay classic as it is, finish phases and then make a WoW Classic really community thing were community could vote and talk with deva about content/future and so on.
---
For sure they have planned more content in Classic that could not be done for whatever reason so maybe we could have or no of people really want it.
---
Regards.
---
You can set up keybinds and you can ensure most, if not all, of your abilities are within fingers reach by making sufficient use of the alt and shift buttons.
---
Pressing a button will always be faster than clicking.
---
Yes for the first question, no idea for the second one.
---
I hope not! One of the main things im looking forward to is actually having ti read the quest and follow the instructions and not feel like im disadvantageing myself by actively switching off a quest helper. Cause knowing everyone else is just blazing passed you cause theyre using it and you arnt isnt fun
---
His idea looks pretty solid to me.
---
Offtopic rly but in Sweden we named a train Trainy McTrainyface
---
In normal version of wow, you can:
---
 \- reach lvl 120 for 4 days of playing
---
\- everything could be achieved easily and without much effort
---
\- there are alot of hints and game is designed to be played from little kids, without thinking.
---
In classic version of wow you can:
---
\- reach lvl 60 for double/triple of this time like 8 days of playing, if you are new in the game maybe more, something like 12 days. 
---
\- everything is achieved harder and you are forced to think how to achieve it. Also you have to group with people, think together for strategies and help each other to achieve best rewards, this is part of the social aspect of this version.
---
\- according to me its not kids frendly version of wow, you have to think about every aspect of the game and there are no hints. Only way to learn stuffs are internet guides, other people, guild or friends and that is part of the social aspect of this version.
---
I think the best of this game is that you are forced to think about strategies and how to develop your way in the world to be powerful, also social part in every aspect of the game. You need time and effort to achieve power and  you feel rewarded with every little achievement on the way. All of this is missing and normal wow is just dumb monotonous grinding.
---
\- Some sets give you energy back;  
---
\- The assassination tree gives you some energy back on finishers;  
---
\- You can pool the opener with your energy regen tick;
---
\- Thistle Tea restores your energy  
---
\- The ZG trinket restores energy
---
Nothing. 
---
It's the same thing that happens after every expansion/ every game/ everything in life
---
High IQ post.
---
His generalizations are quite hilarious actually.
---
i always RP'd it to myself when it came to murloc eyes and shit - the reason they don't drop every time is because you smash them up or burn them with magic or whatever while fighting, and they need to be of a certain standard
---
it kinda makes sense that way
---
This was amazing.
---
Had to make a macro for that shit because people were so friendly
---
I know I've asked a million times but I want as many inputs/opinions on this as possible. I'm already dead set on either Hunter of Warlock. I can't for the life of me pick one. If I had to now I would do Hunter but only because my brother wants to play Nelfs. Please help me!
---
WOW, WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN ?
---
Three years ago, May 2016, did you think Vanilla servers would be a thing? We have no idea what the plans can be, or who will even be at Blizzard by 2022.
---
Engineering bro
---
Swift pots
---
Sleep dust
---
You in for a world of hurt lol
---
What you do as a paladin if hunter is on u and can't close gap is go around an LoS line then beat the shit out of his pet for mana. He will have to come close to u or back off and let u drink/reequip.
---
Unless you're running around with no way to close a gap (which would be retarded), the likelyhood of a hunter taking you is low once ur 60.
---
Espeically without broken lupos. Physical damage pets like brokentooth are a joke to a pala
---
I thought the dismount happened when you got crit by the mob in the back but tanks had -6% base crit chance on themselves which reduced standard mobs crit chance to 0%
---
Orrr, if you have played private servers for the past 4-5 years and know pretty much every fucking quest out there. Or at least where to go and what to look for.
---
Still better than some 60 fuck roaming around because they lost an otherwise fair fight on their alt.
---
Naxx 2, duh
---
Deez nutz
---
Define "feature"
---
You're probably wrong
---
I think he’s saying it’ll still be a fuck ton of people. At a certain point sharding doesn’t even change your experience. Whats the difference between sharing the 1-6 hub with 150 people vs 200? You can’t even tell that theres 50 more/fewer people at that point.
---
Experienced levelers know to avoid these quests.
---
I'm leaning towards playing a rogue in classic, but I'm concerned about it be overpopulated and difficult to get gear on. As a casual player do I need to worry about fighting over gear/spots as a rogue?
---
It is clear the release will be postponed to september, we are already in May and no release date yet.
---
I find orcs popping in and out of my universe in a starting zone less immersion breaking than 500 orcs queuing to kill the same mob.
---
rogues will have the best time in phase one. 
---
Cause there wont be a pvp trinket to obtain as the ranking system comes with phase 2.
---
Rogues will dominate everything in phase 1.
---
Matt Damonkey
---
Healbot worked in classic.
---
\* Rogues are from fresh 60 to naxx one of the best DPS classes, they are also one of the absolute best PvP classes. \*  
---
Comments like these annoy me.  
---
Yes, a rogue can kill anything every 10minutes, with cooldowns up. But they're not very proficient without them. Which means they arent that great in PvP in the grand scheme of things. They also contribute next to nothing in Mass PvP. In terms of casual PvE they're pretty good but they dont excel at all when speedrunning and generally always does less damage than a warrior. When you start going fast you'll find things die before you get 5 or even 4 CPs to use your finishers, having to rely solely on sinister strike.  
---
In conclusion anyway. They're bang average in PvP and PvE. Downvote me all you want but this is how it is.
---
Sound plausible.
---
lmao indeed
---
If you are on with the #nochanges you wouldnt have made this thread. I sound like an a-hole maybe but im speaketh the truth.
---
Earthmaster
---
What we played 14 years ago is Vanilla, what we are going to play is Classic.
---
Hoof smasher! :P
---
Okay? Healbot is still going to be a thing within the first day of classic.
---
I guess a hunter is the best class to solo content with but you wont get around having to group up with ppl if you want at least decent gear like the dungeon set (pre raids gear)
---
Classic will be a different state of raiding though than vanilla was.
---
A majority of ppl will come back and old content like MC, Zul gurub will be much easier to complete on a casual shedule.
---
Mrgl
---
Two words. Windfury Totem, that is all.
---
I'm not sure how it will work
---
But because of private servers as an american you'd have to click cast stop macros, which seems more complciated
---
Basically if you send the /stop cast macro to the server in vanilla you could vastly increase your HPS by getting more perfect casts. 
---
For that reason I do not click cast anything but instants in vanilla. i find it much harder to have a good feel for the timing with a click and i'm more spammy. 
---
Basically you just get some custom frames that let you highlight preferred debuffs, get a threat meter, then that's all one really needs. There were other addons on private servers but we'll see what sort of options the UI has before I call those mandatory. 
---
Luna + Super Macro + Bongos (UI movement, hotbars redone) + BigWigs (in raid organization, warning on mechanics) for PvE. And there are a lot of nice PvP addons I wont' get into because they will undoubtedly all be different
---
and what should I go for professions as a shaman, I see a lot of people always say herb/alchemy, but I also like a profession where I can progress my own toon.
---
The face looks like sims 4. ugh.
---
Tbc
---
so when blizz said get ready for a classic summer they would have meant get ready for the remaining 17 days of the summer ?:P i highly doubt it will be this far late in summer.
---
I would like to see progression to TBC. Players have a time period of 2 months before the BC patch hits, to copy their character/s to a 60 stasis server.
---
That way, people who don't like progression have always the option to go back or stay.
---
I’ve leveled both recently on PS to 30 and I gotta say Priest was a breeze. Paly felt very slow by comparison.
---
Clicking means your mouse isn't available for other actions, such as turning your character or holding the mouse buttons to run. Typically keybinds are also faster than clicking.
---
There's a huge stigma against clickers, because most people just consider it objectively worse. I don't think that judgement is wrong, and I would recommend people to not click, but I've seen clickers at the top of arena all the same. As much as people like to hate on it, it's not a fool-proof sign of a bad player.
---
No. If anything they should ban questing addons.
---
Hunter is an easy choice, you can feign death + trap.
---
Are we just going to use this meme for every zone? Haha
---
My druid raided in Stormshroud. I aim to get the same set again in Classic.
---
I can't remember why, but unending breathe was legit useful at some point...maybe pvp because of a purge spamming?
---
Still undecided on warrior race. Dwarf is what I've narrowed it down for alliance, and Orc or Tauren for Horde. 
---
I prefer warrior animations on horde. Horde also has a better levelling experience IMO due to how they have good dungeon access. However I really hate a lot of how the horde looks, with examples of the difference between Tarren Mill and Southshore, Thelsamar and Kargath and so on. Orgrimmar and Undercity are awful IMO, plus the horde doesn't really have many stories to invest in while I much prefer the alliance storyline IMO. 
---
What you think?
---
Kind of defeats the purpose with classic to add features that were not in the game at the time. If anything they should perhaps rewrite or expand on the objectives in the quest log to make it easier for some to understand where to go and what to kill. NPCs can sometimes be a bit withholding when it comes to locations, though that does give you a reason to explore.
---
Yea, I gotta say the T2 Paly armour is a big draw and I tried out the T3 for size (on my own PS) and it looks way better in game than it does on t’net.
---
I've only healed during wrath and on pservers and always used healbot. It'll be interesting to learn how to manage without it if we don't have addons at first.
---
Whatever you go for, don't go for pala. Pala is the most boring class in the game. No way to farm, being a buff bot, and just castable 2 heals with 1 being instant on a long CD is just too much nope.
---
At first I was trying to live in harmony with him on top of that plateau, but he would always attack me. Over time I developed a big hate for the guy and I basically became his biggest nightmare and vice versa. When I got home from school and went there to farm, I would always circle around and check everywhere carefully to see if he was there. If he was, I would gank him without him knowing and the chaos began. It was happening over a long time
---
If we are talking about optimal leveling then no, you shouldn't try to do a BFD run for equipment upgrades.
---
Grezelda, blackhand's daughter
---
We should all know what the problem is lol
---
Game breaks when there are too many people on the screen
---
The client hasn't been kept in a way so that can 300 people to fight over a world boss without crashing the server. 
---
I'm not sure if it ever was, no one had the computers back then to properly run it anyway. Everything else could be fixed I'm sure almost instantly if they were willing to put in the resources.
---
I doubt they know how to reverse engineer their servers to a point they're stable with 300 people in the same zone again
---
If you want pvp, you need engi. No other way around it.
---
It could be pretty fun though. Maybe just give them free reign and do a sequel movie without trying to line up with a book.
---
Gamon
---
i never said mages dont scale it was this bannedLife4 guy.
---
And i know that the arcanite reaper is the reason why warri is so "strong" early on, and a warri without support gets raped no matter when , we talking releative strengh here.
---
I am just saying, while the game gos on DMG scales way harder then Stamina/Defence, so the classes that dont need defence because they have it in the kit and not in gear get stronger the longer the game gos.
---
Yeah totally, you'll especially do well with a pocket healer. If you learn your class and play well you'll be able to clear a few dungeons a night without much issue, assuming not totally pants on head dps sign up.
---
Mankrik's wife.
---
This petition was made 3 years ago, it started much before this.
---
Runescape?
---
There will be an addon. Case closed. #nochanges
---
Don't go gnome, go human or dwarf. Gnome is really bad in comparison. Escape artist ain't even instant.
---
I would like to see TBC. Maybe give players a 2 month time period to copy their character/s to a 60 stasis realm before the BC patch hits.
---
With that, players who don't like to progress to other expansions can always come back or stay.
---
Tibia. A 20 year old MMORPG with the graffics of your average GameBoy game.
---
It helps... and it doesn't :)!
---
This is basically the list I've been working off in my head as well - since I won't be raiding I don't mind about the frost lock in persay.
---
Both classes are excellent farmers. 
---
I wonder - why do people seem to think Rogue will be the most chosen class?
---
This. Plus you can get accurate directions from reading the quest text...
---
&gt;You're presenting this as some kind of proven, eternal truth. But lots of people here insist that one of the great things about vanilla WoW is that you can noodle around doing pointless things if you like. They think it is a strength, not a weakness. They like arbitrary, self-imposed goals and limitations.
---
That has nothing to do with this conversation. A game should be fun even without that. That you can enhance it further by putting even more self-imposed limitations is a whole different matter.
---
&gt;Nothing forces it to be group PvP, except the fact that you can't do it without a group? Oooookay...
---
Good job ignoring the last part entirely. Even if we assume it is group PvP, it is still non-functional.
---
&gt; *I know I sound like a prick/douchebag/asshole*
---
Well, at least you were right about one thing.
---
camelbak
---
This is defenently interesting. However as you also kinda mention, this is a question for the future post classic release. I dont Think it Will be relevant for the next few years (if ever..)
---
Pallypower!
---
I leveled a priest to 30 recently and loved it. Wand+ talent is way OP, with bubble and/or renew plus psychic scream and you’re indestructible. It is however a very different experience than leveling a mage so YMMV.
---
Defense is useless in pvp?
---
And Stamina scales fine (it's linear), the problem is as you go on there is way more dmg stats on the gear than stam.
---
I as a paladin don't gain all that much stamina gong from t2 to t3.....But I gain a metric shit ton of heal stats
---
Beyond hit % tehre are no diminishing returns we're aware of. And that's more of a hard cap depending on ur target
---
Yea the literal reporting. Although apparently you’re illiterate, because you didn’t read the 2 points that directly supported the radio silence from Blizz. Let me go ahead and create a citation for you on the &amp;0% statistic it’s called go google it  and use voice to text translate from the reporting since you lack the capabilities of reading.
---
Seems fun if you like getting naked with your (presumably male) wow friends.
---
Personally I'm hoping for some sort of season system kinda like Diablo 3. Where every once in a while seasonal  servers open up and every1 can start over fresh. No idea how that would work tho...
---
Will we have skeletons on the ground in classic when it's using the modern core?
---
Do you think they went so far to think about giving the worst water totem first so People will not feel a rush to do the totem quest?
---
Defenitely possible and well thought out if they actually thought about that
---
Have a look at the tier sets to help you decide maybe. Tauren Shaman in T3 is amazing but so is Human  Paly in T2. Decisions, decisions...
---
I get Hunters.. given their ability to farm Mara and I've even seen geared Hunters farm DM N Tribute.. but how do you rate Warlock over Mage? Mage AoE is far superior to Warlocks farming speed..
---
I want new textures to compensate for modern computing capacity, like the texture update packs in games like Morrowind. And I suspect they may do that because otherwise people will be surprised at how "low res" some things are.
---
But no new models or animations or spell graphics or anything like that.
---
I have no idea, do you not get skeletons any more?
---
Mage is nr 1 by far. Dire Maul jump runs are extremely lucrative.
---
This sort of thing is lame and unfun. So fuck off outta here.
---
Defias Brotherhood, too! (on EU)
---
do you too want to play with all the children, angsty teenagers and leet killers? look no further, the 50% undead faction is waiting for you
---
I've always been a fan of pre cata Hunters, they're the class appeals to my preferences the most. I only started during the very early stages of WOTLK and have played a few classic PServers but not enough to be doing any raiding. 
---
From what i keep reading Hunters seems to go down in rankings further down the content chain, am i at risk of missing out on raid content because i may be seen as an inferior class?
---
Maybe I'm stupid but to which of my sentences are you answering by "lol no"?
---
" but it's still not enough to compete with war/mage/rogue/lock in terms of pure damage "
---
Did you even read my post before answering it?
---
They don't stay on the ground as long so there wouldn't be the same kind of build-up.
---
I agree. A rogue used as it's supposed to, that is as an assassin, is incredibly powerful. As a "frontline warrior" not so much.
---
Do you have a link to the announcement?
---
Barrens Chat
---
Dirge
---
with defense i mean the ability to soak dmg, a shadowpriest in blue feels insanly tanky for example.
---
ofc i dont mean the stat defence, bad wording.
---
Jea i know later sets have low stamina and some classes cant even use rank 13 sets to boots it, that was my point.
---
And since a class like mage or rogue allways have the "upper hand" and strike first its hard or near impossible for some classes to fight them as soon they hit a undefinied geartrashold.
---
Sure the DR on Stamina is not a mechanik but since there is no gear with exessive amounts of stamina you cant stack it to resist the dmg naxx geared ppl throw at you, and classes like mages and rogue are good in applying the dmg with taking it.
---
But maybe my viewpoint is screwd abit since everything i think about is 1v1.
---
I have PTSD from my Warrior soloing this spot trying to get the quests done. I’d be successful in pulling 1-2 max and by the time I’m done with my pulls, the respawns happen again and I’m back to square one! 
---
Good times. Reminded me that I can always find someone to group with
---
I'm doing the biggest research I can to decide which healer I'm going to main. I'm a alt-thot, so I'm keeping in mind that I'll test the rest later, it's only a matter of what to play first. Also, I'm only taking PvE into mind, since PvP will only be something casual for me.
---
 I'm afraid that there will be a massive amount of priests in the beginning and that it will be hard to find a spot since everyone that wants to heal will probably pick the safest option. I'm not sure that picking dwarf will give me an enough headstart to grab those good dungeon/raid invite.  
---
 In the other hand, I'm thinking in going alliance, and the fact that priest are the only with AoE heals will maybe make them a lot more requested than other classes?
---
I also have a secondary question: It is possible to heal dungeons before-60 with leveling-dps/hybric builds? I guess leveling up with the standart healing builds will slow down questings, and it's not really worth to level up mainly doing dungeons, right?
---
You can usually level with a combination of white vendor guns. BoE guns from the auction house or quest rewards. The problem is that you will reach a point where no upgrade is available for some reason (the one on the AH is too expensive, vendor doesn't have anything for your level, etc.) Be flexible while leveling, you won't have perfect gear all the time so you will need to learn bows at some point - the alternative would be to continue using a gun 10 or 20 levels too low for RP reasons, and not killing anything.
---
Assuming 1.12 honor system implementation, which is not confirmed yet, basically once you buy an item you can use it forever. However if for example you don't buy the item and lose rank you can't buy it again. Same goes for discount and access to officer barracks. Same goes if they implement new pvp rewards like they did back then, old rank 14s could not purchase them.
---
You will always display current rank.
---
somebody talk me out of going rogue, my heart says rogue but my brain says mage.
---
Leveling/gearing aside how annoying is playing a melee vs a caster in high end raids/pvp
---
There are plenty of priest slots in a raid.
---
As the game goes on banks grow
---
People more ready to flask
---
ZG buffs flow
---
People adapt when they get nuked lol
---
Same here. I had multiple ranks of AI on my bar to make buffing easier.
---
Thanks for the info, give John Titor my regards
---
Definitely don’t need or want this it’s good they will fix it with sharing
---
Yup, pass
---
my assumption was the pet and self heals
---
  it's not something you see often on Pserver 
---
If it's half way decent it's been done by much better players wasting their time sharing their strats

I don't think my planned Tauren Druid can reach STV in time to avoid the carnage
---
The adds - wipe pulls.
---
People call stranglethorn vale STV or STVietnam because there are corpses everywhere at nessingwary camp and all around because players on on their main will farm you forever. The worst is when a rogue does it because you will never find him.
---
Any luck on that? I can't find anything! I'd like to see that as well.
---
There are plenty of mobs to grind elsewhere, I never understood this queuing nonsense.
---
I feel the same way about my characters. If you want to make stuff for yourself, then your options are: blacksmith/mining for weapons (if you're going enhancement), herb/alch for potions, engineering/mining for PvP consumables, and leatherworking/skinning for crafting leather/mail gear. I'd say go leatherworking / skinning and make your gear as you go; that always feel most satisfying to me. You might make more money elsewhere, but that doesn't incorporate Rule 1: Enjoy the game.

You don't have to worry about STV, if you're looking forward to STV. Without a bunch of 60s running around world PvP in STV turns into a bush fight. Some of the best world PvP around.
---
Hunters are necesarry throughout all raid tiers, they are the pull and kiting machines. Their DPS is really bad in comparison to a Mage or geared Warlock though, so you ideally only bring a couple hunters to a raid.
---
As long as you're able to be one of the core hunters in your guild you'll be fine.
---
Hey guys. I hear this new server is getting pretty popular. Let's reroll on Manrik's wife!
---
Fuck yeah my man
---
I would, but there are no RP PVP realms at this time. PVP is a massive part of the game experience for me - it is the world of WARcraft after all.
---
Actually it's true. Next expansion I believe they're reducing the level to 60 again and making progression more similar to classic.
---
Oh your point about them updating the shop files in the base client? The same base client that will work across both games? The same base client that you already demonstrated you don't seem to understand their reasons for including aside from your asinine theories? 
---
And making a claim and then backing it up with "go google it" is not a valid argument. You've got no idea what you're talking about, stop parroting shit you read on the internet with no source.
---
My vanilla days of playing a priest as main is over.
---
I used to love doing this aswell but time for others to take over my watch and for me to be the one getting buffs.
---
As a rogue though i will still help anyone i see levelling if they need my dmg to just kill that quest boss little faster :)
---
Why do private servers always refresh? Is there a specific reason?
---
I click off buffs people give me just to be a dick.

There will be 20 players/boar so better get in line
---
First means everyone is behind you, where rogues like to be
---
Won’t happen , next
---
Perhaps when the player base goes down they'll consider it. But before that I doubt it
---
Who’s president?
---
So... what happens after Nax is dead servers with ocasional UBRS runs?
---
No, everyone.  The man has spoken; you are fucked.  Or okay.  Depends on his thesis.
---
Awesome, thanks for the insight :)
---
if you go with the priest you can mind control people off boats/ into lava and brm, its why im rolling priest!
---
it's cool to collect tier sets but bear in mind they are almost never BiS for any class, sometimes they are good for PvP though. You'll be wearing robes if you wanna min/max as a holy paladin.
---
How do you want to use grenades or sleeping dust or anything else when the hunter is +40yrds away from you?
---
Straight into BfA
---
That is what you said
---
Couple of things: 
---
- As the other commenter said, there are tons of priest healing spots in raids. 
---
- Most people who roll a character aren't going to hit 60. 
---
- People hit 60 at different times, so raid spots will open / fill at different times. 
---
- Priest are popular healers because they're the most versatile. See point 1.
---
- You're overthinking it. Roll a priest.
---
As to your other question: You can easily heal as a DPS spec if you keep a set of healing gear. You won't have a problem until the end-game dungeons and you'll be nearing 60 at that point anyway. At least, that applies to priest and I'm pretty sure to others as well.
---
Yea mages will be tier one, but DM isnt out til phase 2 so theres that. Guess there are other lucrative places for mages in phase 1
---
Warlocks can farm Mara like hunters. Hense why up the top

ts so easy to say "like OSRS" isn't it?  But doesn't seem like you can tell me how they should do it. Tell me if  you know why vanilla content was relevant. Ill give a hint.
---
Tell  me how is Blizzard a team that consist of people that have nothing to  do with the developers form 2004 and their vision. How can they recreate  everything about that without risking breaking everything?
---
It  will require them to basically work on 2 MMOS, and the chance for us to  see the ToC/IC effect is too big. I mean the WotLK patch that  introduced ToC and IC dungeons, you remember? The moment 80% of the game  turned pointless and braindead easy.
---
Im  not attacking you, just wondering how do you propose blizzard can apply  the OSRS treatment and succeed. Do we know how a totally different game  succeeded? Why is OSRS compared to WoW in the first place? Are people  actually happy with the changes in OSRS? What happens if over time the  people who are voted down when it comes to content, decide to ask for  "vanilla realms, because they didn't like the changes that accumulated  in the past 2 years"
---
Im  interested to hear your opinion on this, So many things can break, and  you compare OSRS with a game that is million times more famous than  OSRS.
---
Do  you trust Blizzard enough, do you trust the player base? The year is  2019, how do you keep the game from turning into a playground for the  "instant gratification people" which are majority? These people don't  care about OSRS, but they are and will always be the majority when it  comes to hyped games, which includes WoW. Do you give them the OSRS  "Voting" rights?
---
My  opinion&gt;your opinion, thats all that will happen, ending in disaster  for classic. Better throw around server restarts or open fresh servers.  I came for classic not to VOTE for eventual changes. If i wanted to  vote, id go into politics.
---
Every  one being "OSRS would be awesome". Wonder how much of them even know  what OSRS, and why Vanilla worked. Im willing to bet that they just  "know" that OSRS is a thing, and in their minds it will "simply work".  Keeping the Vanilla spirit alive through adding new content, will  require more work that Retail does.
---
Its  one thing to add content, its another to make sure the new content IN  NO WAY removes the reason to do the old, at all times. Good luck making  blizzard do this, and even if they did, i don't trust them enough.
---
Putting the future of Classic in the hands of the same people that led you to want classic in the first place. Ludicrous.
---
Warlocks are good.. but I believe that Mages and Hunters are the top.
---
Warriors are superior dps
---
And that only lasts the first few hours. Who knows how long sharding will last, and if it will expand to zones like The Barrens, which would kill early world pvp raids.
---
I'd prefer not to sacrifice those gameplay elements just for a bit of convenience at the very beginning of a server launch. Sacrificing that content for a bit of player convenience is antithetical to the aims of a classic server. The whole reason that people have left the game and are coming back is because of the sacrifice of content in the name of player convenience that's taken place over the years.
---
Well, I personally don't.
---
But this is part of vanilla. Sometimes you just don't run the dungeon you wanted that day. It happens. A solution to that is the LFD tool, but hey, look at what happened to retail.
---
Sometimes it's nice to not have everything you want. Makes you value them more when they happen.

Then, and after enough of the opposing faction have died, maybe we shall have our freedom.

That or they convert to TBC, though I have opinions on that.
---
I thought Ele Shaman can't do PvE content because everyone doesn't want to be gimped for a spot and mana issues of course?
---
Fair enough haha
---
I’ve played PvE and I was pretty casual w no problems-guess I could have added that :)
---
Again you LoS....
---
Bait his pet in and just beat it with seal of wisdom. He can't hit you...Cuz you're in some nook LoSing him or running around a pillar while he's keeping range. 
---
All you have to do to beat a hunter as a paladin is not chase him unless you know u can close that gap....ANd if you can't catch him you certainly don't have to die unless he catches you somewhere where there is literally nothing to hide behind.
---
Or at least a wizard hat and robes.
---
don't let the beginner zones deter you from playing different races... it's only like 2% of your entire leveling experience and you can always meet up down the road.
---
Instanced is usually better which is why the mage is insane when it comes to gold farming. So insane that quite a few people on private servers level a mage just to farm gold. Even for a hardcore player a mage will still take 100-200 hours depending on how much you can boost him. 
---
Hunters and warlocks are decent in Maraudon and warlocks can perhaps do a thing in another dungeon which would make them on par with the mage, knowing my shitty luck it probably won't work on Classic.
---
Thanks mr prophet, can you give a shout out to my boys in gnomeregan?
---
More like taking a break and then resubbing
---
When the player base goes down and they expect them to bow down and accept something they don't want simply because they are "minority", the answer will be separate servers. Which will most likely result in community split over time, leading to even more problems. 
---
Sometimes things die, sometimes fresh servers without changes are the answers. Private servers still thrive for that reason. No one put Nax 2 in those servers.
---
Old school runescape releases new content and look at it's success. They keep to their original design philosophy, and continue adding and it's more popular than ever.
---
However knowing blizzard they will likely just do what people below had said and call it season content.
---
We got “post classic” when TBC came out.  This whole endeavor is to bring Classic back.  So let’s keep it that way
---
Kind of like STD's, but for wow.
---
I would be very welcome to the idea of additional added content after naxx has been out for a while. Additional bosses in previous raids, added pvp content and perhaps new additions to the long outdated professions. Damn, get psyched!
---
Realistically though, we can only wait and see. Blizzard surprised us with the classic announcement, but we're not there yet.
---
Same story here, but I started on Nost 3 years ago. It was the same thing that hooked me though. It's the world that grabs you, not so much the gameplay at times. Just keep in mind that the content can become quite stale after a while and it's definitely okay to take a break from it. Don't force yourself to play it or you'll burn out real quick. Also find some friends to play with, either irl or in-game. That's one of the best things about vanilla.

i played a rogue casually back in vanilla and had a blast. I think I only ended up with 2-3 epics by the end of it but I still enjoyed ganking people and being a general nuisance.

You should treat StV like an STD. If you take countermeasures and they don't fail, you won't get sick of it. Use a condom every time you visit StV people!
---
So they refresh? Do people not mind losing their progress?
---
Uhm, yeah.. Dont reproduce..
---
Depends on what you want to do. Hunter is certainly a very good option. Self sufficient.  Very strong in lower levels of gear, great at farming and world PvP, not reliant on a group and plenty high of a skill ceiling so you’re never bored. 
---
The problem with warrior is they are literally walking free honor kills until they start acquiring raid gear and even with raid gear they really only shine in a group setting with plenty of support. Mages and hunters can literally kite them to death in greens lol
---
El. Psy. Kongroo.
---
I see it asked a lot what race / class is best for soloing or raiding or whatever. But what is the WORST race and class combination all around, if you want to have the hardest time with everything in the game? Like the worst starting area, most unpleasant leveling experience, most useless racial for class or role, and utterly unwanted by anyone, for anything, if you even manage to make it to the end.
---
Sounds like the overall gist is to get in on a PVE server if I want to enjoy the story/adventure a bit more and not have to stress on being murdered from time to time. Because as much as I'd love to get more involved with WoW, based on my life style currently and the fact I enjoy other games as well.

Not everyone wants questhelper.

You should really put the details in your original post so that "viewership" isn't gated behind an affirmative communication. I've glanced over your ad several times now simply because it's the only guild ad that doesn't provide basic raiding information, let alone anything else.

I wish this was true and all but it rly isnt.

Go look up the sources yourself. You lazy ass go look up your own shit before trying to argue anything. Go look at any gaming news channel when blizz made the layoffs. Either admit you like being cucked by blizz or just state you don’t know what you’re talking about. Blizz has their hand so far up your ass you’ve become a puppet.
---
Reminds me of my first raid as a NE.. the cave in Teldrassil with all the timbermaws
---
No it didn’t start with this

If you're only playing casually like you mention you could pick literally any class. Gotta be more specific. What are you leaning towards? Do you want to play Ranged DPS/Melee DPS/Healer/Tank/etc

Me and my friends are 100% rolling RP-PVP if available.
---
Mage can aoe from lv 23+, I reached lv 60 in days played with 1100gold
---
Mages are broken, tons and tons of AoE spots, not just the main ones everyone fight over.. arathi highlands itself is a melee zone, so anywhere is aoeable.
---
Also other places like dustwallow raptors, or hinterland slime can aoe so early on finding tons of greens, blues, greys to vendor. once you get your mount + Ice barrier it gets retarded..
---
&gt; but not deserve
---
Apparently..
---
I'll have to investigate this further tonight. I've played wow from vanilla to wotlk, and pservers on &amp; off since.  Ive never tried dipping away from clicking. Perhaps if I figure it out on my pserver now, I wont have to go through the learning curve when classic drops.
---
Dragon Finger of Healing
---
What is ignorant is to assume that everyone is for no changes.

Nope. I think they are trying to keep costs to an absolute minimum for Classic.

I would absolute lose my shit (and probably cry) if we boot up on launch and theres a F R E S H cinematic tho!

Couldn’t find it anywhere in the list!

I was playing in Vanilla when they added weather effects into the game - first time I saw it was coming out of the gates of Stormwind into Ellwyn Forest and thinking oh cool, they added weather.

I haven't looked closely at the content phases yet, I'll wait until launch with that. If Maraudon is part of the first phase, then mages will make their money there.

You think that's a possibility for him?

While you guys stand around waiting to complete that quest, id just be out past the doors grinding the level 5-6's.

oh ok then ,#nochanges
---
nelf priest is what springs to mind, but even then I could see you having fun with Shadowmeld-Mindcontrol and also star shards is the most mana efficient spell in the game, so I dunno.
---
maybe tauren hunter? but war stomp is quite useful when a melee starts in on you.
---
that's the thing, racials are really not that important, they're a tiny addition to an already large class toolkit.
---
You seem a bit angry.
---
I didn't say that an hunter will overdps a war even if he's a hunter god.
---
You don't see it more on Pserver because it requires way more "work" than just sitting back and using aiming shot, classic content is easy and you don't need it to clear any raid.
---
People theorycrafting like to share what they found, but I can see you're selfish and wouldn't share any knowledge just to have a chance to be better than others.
---
People clearly understand that hunter won't magically become top 1 dps yet they still try to find way to improve their dps.
---
Hope to not see you in game, you look toxic af.
---
i was talking about that actually but my wild english appeared and it wad not very effective
---
They can do PvE content if they heal in a Ele spec with at least 20 points in the Resto tree. All you will miss out on is Mana Tide and some +healing. It might not work out for Naxxramas, but for at least MC and BWL it's doable.
---
Nice to see you again #nochanges crowd. Kisses
---
No one denies hunter has the highest skill ceiling
---
Even if you hit that ceiling hunter still sucks
---
You're confusing skill ceiling with production

plot twist: She quit school to level up with you.
---
to be honest this is a minor change and i really dont care if they do or not , i wanted to see reddit thoughts on that .
---
&gt;Okay? Healbot is still going to be a thing within the first day of classic.
---
It won't be, because Blizzard is using retail and tweaking it to mimic the way Classic behaved. Healbot is explicitly prevented in retail, so they aren't going to code in a "feature" that they purposely blocked because in they viewed it as botting.
---
I did the same, I was 12 in vanilla and came from The 4th Coming MMO so I just played with arrows until late TBC. I actually got to 2k as resto druid lock in 2v2 using arrows and clicking.. when my team mate found out he almost passed out, I just didn't know keybinds existed
---
Now I can't play without binds at all.
---
yeah , not for each point just a warning when you finish all your available points .
---
I legit always thought it was called StrangleHorn Vale. That's what i've been saying since Wrath of the Lich King. I didn't understand the acronym because then it would be SHV
---
Problem is there cannot be one minor change. Eventually we got 250 minor changes and everything is changed. The Idea is good and I actually thought about it recently.
---
I don’t get it.
---
This is a terrible idea, but:

Lol I'm not the one claiming 80% of WoW GMs got fired in the Activision layoffs. You don't make a claim then tell people to go look it up, if you're so confident you should be able to easily point me to a source. You're so full of shit, and for someone that seems to dislike Blizz so much I'd wager you're gonna be paying them for a Classic sub.
---
Everything was fine until 
---
&gt;it'll end up killing FFXIV: Shadowbringers ***and also BFA***. 
---
Then it's obvious that it's fake. You can't end up killing something that is already dead.
---
Oh god we are twins. About half the time they would attack me despite a 20+ level difference so I would fear them and walk away. Then later on at 60 when it is more evenly matched into the lava or drowning them with that and stuff like poly or goblin rocket helm it is.
---
Depending if there is a beta of how much info blizzard gives of the NEW lua classic specific stuff to addon devs, i dont see many addons working at launch. A lot of them will NEVER work.
---
Yup
---
At this point it's not even worth the effort but here we go:
---
&gt;You are here for confirmation. All you want to hear is "Oh what a great and interesting idea. you are so smart. here have an upvooooote". However, this is reddit, and not a facebook echo chamber. Which is why your "thread" has a zero rating, despite some sheep upvoting your comments, because enough people think it's a dumb idea.
---
On the post itself I acknowledged there would be people who disagreed with the idea my dude, I took the time to read the people who brought decent arguments against the change, and most of the time agreed with them, even acknowledged your opinion despite the fact that you were and still are a condescending jackass lol  
---
&gt;You cannot deal with people challenging your opinion, and thus accuse them of being "vile", same as a certain orange clown does all the time.
---
Fucking lol, you are so up your own ass you must be tasting bile, because saying you "don't give a rat ass" about other people changing my conception and opinion, and being aggressive trough the whole ordeal is the peak of serenity and cordiality, I should be ashamed for thinking otherwise, you are clearly talking with the most pure intentions by being passive aggressive, and then when questioned straight up aggressive towards me, my bad, I'm sure I am the one who can't deal with people challenging my opinion. And I'm not even going to comment the orange clown insult, because if we go into politics we might end up agreeing, and by your attitude it seems like something you'd want to avoid, so I'm going to spare you the trouble.    
---
&gt;It won't be on console, and there is nothing you can do about that. Case closed.
---
Now this one is a doozy, I not sure where to start, I don't own any consoles but I guess it could be pretty fun to play on switch with the touch screen and some amendments, but I don't mind it being a PC exclusive for the time being. (/s , for real I have no idea what you're talking about here lol)
---
Anyway, you clearly have some mental issues to tackle, but I truly hope you do well, reach your goals, and have a great live dude.
---
Mage no question, aoe farming dungeons is a license to print money regardless of the market.
---
So you haven’t played Modern WoW then. You can’t Mount in combat.
---
Also who cares about world PvP after BGs are out?
---
It’s all just Rogues ganking you out of nowhere then stealthing away, you can’t chase them.
---
nah , it s just at the end not for each point.
---
&gt;graffics 
---
🤮
---
&gt;In what area is a rogue "grossly overrated"? Mass PvP? maybe, but not really. Focus on healers and the battle turns.
---
Because your power is so tightly tied to cooldowns. You are overpowered when you use them, and darn near useless when you dont have them up.
---
Thanks for a constructive argument against my proposition. You are the first one.
---
You will have to forgive me for not bothering with restating all the arguments that I and a lot of others have had to tell people since Classic was released. As I said it does get frustrating. The problem that underlies our discussion, as far as I can tell, is the question of why we want to play Classic.
---
 
---
Judging by your arguments (and by others who advocate changes – however reasonable or unreasonable they are) you primarily want to play Classic because the game itself was better back then than it is now. You want a real MMORPG again and all that comes with it. For you it doesn’t matter as much if you change this or that because you’re after a better version of World of Warcraft. Sure, some nostalgia probably plays into it but it is not the most important factor for you.
---
Then there are those who, like me, want to play Classic for Classic. Nostalgia is a big part of this but it is not only that. There are many other important reasons. First of all, and even Blizzard has acknowledged this, there should be an option to play WoW as it was back in its original form. Just as you can boot up any old console game if you like. World of Warcraft is an important game and a cultural phenomenon that defined the MMORPG genre. There is value in preserving it and I think most people can appreciate this. Changing the original game, for instance by tweaking the class balance, completely defeats the purpose of trying to capture and preserve this important piece of gaming history.
---
But even if we were to ignore the above mentioned argument and accept that changes should be made to the game, there remains a host of difficult questions to answer. What changes should be made? And how are they to be implemented? You mentioned for instance fixing class balance (and please don’t get me started on scrapped content ideas). Okay, according to what design philosophy? The vanilla one or the modern one? Besides this, changing class balance is notoriously difficult. It is not a simple question of changing a few numbers and buffing certain specs. Blizzard has continuously failed at achieving a class balance. What makes you think that they could ever achieve it in a Classic setting? The most likely outcome of this is a new situation of imbalance. This is partly the reason why people ask you to go play retain when you bring up the topic of class balance in Classic. In addition, the balance of vanilla in 1.12 is not as bad as people often argue. As mentioned earlier many of us actually like it. The safest option, and the only option if you care about an authentic vanilla experience, is to leave the class balance as it was.
---
All in all, this is why I said Classic is not for you. In some regards, even if you don’t want to admit it, you do not want to play Classic. You want to play something that is mostly classic but improved. However, Blizzard and the community have made it abundantly clear that they want an authentic vanilla experience. So asking for changes that go completely against this is at best nonsensical and annoying.
---
You seem upset. You should go.

Then I have some more binds on the side buttons of my G600, things like trinkets, wand, Inner Focus, Mind Control etc. It's still a work in progress though, I want to make room for more healing ranks and easier cc/PvP spells.
---
Well I don’t want to rank and leveling as a healer provably sucks. Otherwise no preference
---
When you look at dwarf females and wonder where all the development time went.
---
&gt;What's the major drawback of clicking?
---
It's a lot slower if you need to press several keys in quick succession or at once. You also can't control your camera or the way your character is facing while clicking abilities (turning with your keyboard is extremely slow). 
---
&gt;Tbh I don't get how the alternative to clicking is done.
---
You use the mouse to control which way your character is facing. You use WASD to move your character. You bind abilities to the keys around WASD and press those keys to use your abilties.
---
Fixed it for you.

A friend I know is betting it's after Blizzcon - so that would be a christmas release, and aneurysms all round in here.
---
I'm keeping 3 days of leave for it, so all I need is one week's notice
---
Thats much more convinient than that voting quiz, thanks.

I know many ppl love sfk, but im not the biggest fan, maybe i've done it too many times, no doubt its amazing and very memorable to do for the first time(s), no shit. But imo even in the same level range BFD i much stronger of a dungeon with a very unique atmosphere, underwater dynamics, more interesting bosses (that statue event along is amazing, and the secret sea monster underwater boss, jump thingy, murlocs room etc.), and fights and whole dynamic of the dungeon in general is very cool. I always liked bfd, just a personal choice.
---
Everything else is quite normal choices i think. both wailing caverns and deadmines are amazingly designed dungeons imo, ive done them soooo many times and it seems that i love them even more. and they dont bore me. and i cant say the same about some other dungeons.
---
Same. Rolled RP-PVP in Vanilla and never regretted it.
---
Thunderfury
---
The R15 title ties in with your race &amp; city boss, you become the face of that faction among the players. With R14, all you get is a nice weapon. If R15 was still around, there wouldn't be nearly as much hype around R14 because it's not the max rank.
---
no healing class levels as a healer (unless they really want to), you can heal from inside your damage specs quite easily and respec at max level.
---
either way you gotta narrow it down yourself, focus on playstyle and aesthetic.
---
Lol good luck with that
---
September is still in summer, so it hasn't been postponed (yet)
---
After, or during, Blizzcon would be my bet
---
Same happened to me with "Ogrimmar".
---
Definitely not referring to you, I just don't want devs to cater to the hardcores this time around
---
From what you have written in this thread, yes, you'll likely be better off on a PvE server.
---
(Nothing wrong with PvP servers, **if** you know what you are getting into and like it. I suspect a large part of the speaking down to PvE server players by PvP-ers and the strenuous assertions that "only on PvP servers can you play the *true* game" is because they are afraid if people wise up to their bullshit there were be much fewer ~~victims~~ people to gank. :)
---
Finding the right pet food sucked especially when you had to change pets occasionally.  Oh boy I get to figure out where the vendor is, sell my old food because of limited bag space, and then buy an 80 stack. Why can't you all just eat meat!
---
Warriors are better. Much better.
---
The illusion of choice!
---
Thanks for the info. I love classicdb.ch, but my hope was to be able to look at a single place for an item rather than checking multiple websites per item. Nice trick with the item number!
---
Someone mentioned THUNDERFYRY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER?!?!?!?
---
I thought it was going to be 2 questions, the way it's set up takes too long to answer for most people.
---
BOW makes my pants feel funny as a healer.
---
You lucky bastard.
---
Thanks dawg.
---
I don’t think everyone needs the taunt resist set bonus. 
---
Someone earlier was mentioning that as long as 3 taunts in a row don’t miss it’s all manageable.

Thanks a lot!

I do the exact same thing!! +1

Legend of stalvan or just "Stalvan"?
---
if you haven't seen this epi, this is for sure r/gifsthatendtoosoon

Druids are really fast levelers, but not many people play them so you're probably still right on mostly hunters and warlocks.
---
Ahhhhh traveling for work. 100% makes sense. You do you.
---
&gt;&gt;Healbot is explicitly prevented in retail
---
Shit, can you explain I haven't played wow in a couple years but used healbot from BC til then. Did they do something that crossed a line or decide it was too much?
---
Thanks friend. But
---
I'm far from bothered, had a good laugh with his last comment comparing me to a certain president. Even if his comments are distilled vitriol it's amusing to see someone so self centered trying to argue while spilling random bullshit and insults, might be his way to cope with something else tho, so just I hope he is fine.
---
However fast you think you got to STV, there is someone who is already level 60 and has been waiting in the bushes in STV for days for you.
---
Depends when you did it too. The original honor system had an even lower number of players eligible to be GM/HW before they increased the percentage
---
Well it's not really a debatable topic
---
Like I said gap is enormous, idk if blizzard wanted it that way. I suspect looking at tranq shot they did

But certainly that's how it worked out

Here is a life lesson for you that has nothing to do with WoW:
---
If her quiting school is not in line with your life goals she isnt the one for you then. This depends on her reasons of course. Cut your losses now. 
---
This is goes for both gf's and bf's out there.
---
Don’t fret too much about it, it’s always good to start small.
---
Start using Q ERTF and then F1 to F5 and then start using shifts and alt keybinds.
---
At least that’s how I progressed from clicking.
---
Well this discussion is slowly starting to become redundant.
---
 "Perfect parses are out there" I agree with that, well at 95% cuz you're never sure, but I was pointing out to OP that some high-end rotation have been developed by theorycrafter yet they cannot beat war/rogue/mage/lock on the meter. 
---
Again, I did NOT say that hunter are better than other dps, just that the high-skill required rotation increase the dps by 50-100.
---
"What is dead may never die"
---
It’s a Triple P kind of day over at Countdown To Classic as the show discusses Paladins, Podcasting, and Playing Roles (that’s kind of cheating, I know).
---
Listen as as three very experienced and knowledgeable players, Theloras, Smiter, and Sonosuke, talk listeners through the minutiae of Paladin PvE across all three specs, in what was a very extensive and enjoyable chat.
---
After that we hear from a group of passionate RP-PvP’ers who want their voices heard all the way in Irvine, CA about why Blizzard should reconsider their position on not having RP-PVP servers at launch.
---
And, finally, the show is lucky enough to welcome some WoW Podcasting royalty in Star Mike (World of Warcast) &amp; Rho (Realm Maintenance), along with two newcomers to the podcasting game in Allen &amp; Anthony (The Classic Casual), to discuss the history and fun of podcasting about World of Warcraft.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Paladin PvE with Theloras, Smiter &amp; Sonosuke – 3:35
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – RP-PvP Players Call For Change with Halwin, Deathwatch, Sirtruk, Takk &amp; Undoer – 1:17:40
---
* Calling Countdown #3 – Podcasting WoW with Star Mike, Rho, Allen &amp; Anthony – 1:46:10

Do you consider UBRS a raid and not a normal dungeon?
---
Guess i want a quicker release. Speaking of which, shouldn't the beta already be here? We're getting closer to summer and a beta should at least last about a month or so right?
---
I know the pieces fit.
---
Hoddor!
---
Has to be nelf warrior. Warrior leveling on it's own is pure shit for the most part but combine that the worst race combination as a nightelf, the probably worst alliance starting region and being the only alliance race on a horde continent and I think we got a winner.
---
what if you life goal is spending all day on wow
---
That wasnt even close to the point of this video. wtf
---
if you can't appreciate orgrimmar and undercity you're not a true horde. go alliance where they have regular human, small human, smaller human and tall purple human.
---
I am working on the premise you are nearly grasping, and only a few here have. Only one of which has constructively disagreed with me and made fair points. I stand by the belief that my OP intent is clear. Yes, "top tiering" them was particularly rare by percentage. Absurdly so. And the vast majority believe that their private server experience counts as experience with original, and that is just not the case. I have not seen any substantial data from the original game that says a good player can't compete in pure dps on a hunter. But I can fairly easily conceive of excellent reasons that people have been mislead in their perception of endgame hunters.
---
That is true of course. Which is my point, this whole min max thing kills the fun.
---
That would fit perfectly with that rod he's carrying, oh wait..
---
What am I meant to be proving?
---
After watching each episode more times than I’d like to admit, I can confirm this is peak r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
Keep it going. Awesome podcast!
---
I'm telling you he didnt come up with anything unique 13 years later after people who were gods relative to him spend years of their lives pouring over the rotation

Stop

Then find a sugar momma/daddy.

but bro shadowmeld ganking lowbies is so much fun
---
I remember, when i first tried tbc with trial account, ang got insanely hooked, leveled like 6 characters to 20 lwl, put probably over 70 hours into warsong gulch as 19 lwl.
---
But i couldnt afford subscription at a time.
---
Did play in few pservers fell in love with draenei shammy.
---
Sadly i wont be able to play with my love on classic ant try this new experience with it.
---
But looking forward to it nontheless!
---
NO! NOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
I said "mail/plate".
---
&gt;I never said it instantly kills you
---
You literally said "Miss/dodge/parry 1-2 more autos and you are instantly dead."
---
Whatever pserver you played on obviously had massively overtuned mob damage or fucked up armor values or something, because it takes a LOT for 1 quest mob to kill a warrior from 100% to dead, given the armor and high base health. Getting a few dodge/parries does not kill you.
---
You're.
---
You know..... Being from the future means you're not actually a prophet. A prophet would mean you have been given clairvoyance from our Lord Metzin and his son, green jesus.

Here’s a life lesson OP: Don’t take relationship advice from someone on the internet. Specifically, from any WoW subreddit.
---
This! I once had a gf that told me I was old enough to work instead of continuing to study when I got accepted for my master's degree. Luckly I left her few days after that.
---
Education is important people! Relashionships come and go but your education stays forever with you.
---
I appreciate the info. Thank you dear timewalker.
---
Ohhh...I thought you meant the first day the server is released. Like everyone starts from lvl 1 lol
---
haha good point. I appreciate your input and honesty! Everyone's comments on this subject has been extremely helpful.
---
Goodness me, have an upvote!
---
Rly?
---
Interesting. deleting my post.
---
I actually still don't believe it. Unless I see it in my hands, it does not exist.
---
I appreciate your reflection. You do have to assume equal skilled players though, but you bring up a lot of points that people like tips out on youtube just completely gloss over, like utility value. I suppose he is inadvertently doing us a service by making less competition for the hunter class.
---
Yeah, like Blizzard would ever do megaservers, going against one of their core design philosophies completely and making #changes to the game.
---
I am coming back to Vanilla as the hypetrain is getting to me :) 
---
I used to be a hardcore raider in a top 2 guild on our server and an avid PvP'er, so experience shouldn't be a problem and i treasure the social aspect of the game more than anything else. I used to main Hunter but want this to be a whole new experience and will probably roll a Pinky Tinker mage.
---
I am looking for a guild with the social aspect in mind which is why Vanilla was the best game ever made and what made me enjoy it through all the hours of painful reputation grinding for that sweet winterspring frostsaber.
---
The only concern i have is that You already have 80+ members and i was wondering if You see this as a problem regarding the fact that everyone probably want to be a part of the raid progression? 
---
So if You are looking for a social, experienced and flexible (though no room for night elves between these small legs) addition to Your roster You are very welcome to Hit me up
---
Has nothing to do with WoW. I don't come on here for politics. I have other boards for that.
---
L E E T
---
Right on. I've played since vanilla, raided with almost every class, but never mained a warrior in vanilla. Thanks for the input.
---
but what about the fishing contest on Sunday!
---
Quallity podcasts. Keep it up.
---
We were 3 Taurens and real-life friends who used to travel in Kalimdor catch our fresh fish put the campfire on and chase rare mobs. Travelling without a flying mouth was the greatest part of our road trips.
---
You can always make new friends. After all, it's a damn game. Your old friends will not stop being your friends and on the contrary you could know some new ones. 
---
Be an alliance is a matter of principle, because the snowball of the Horde is real and many people wants to be on the winning side. Also I feel so good playing as gnome and i have fun annoying hordies :3
---
I think altnob is confused, there's 2 versions of healbot. There's the raid frames one where you bind spells to mouse buttons and click-cast on the raid frames to heal people. That one will work. There's another version of healbot that auto-targets the lowest person in a raid, and casts the appropriate downranked healing spell. That one will not work, because it basically removes all player agency and they just need to spam the heal button and literally do nothing else, so it got banned.
---
I’m guessing warrior where he would literally replace it a level later lol
---
WotF is arguably better than Endurance. Endurance *plus* War stomp however is pretty useful.
---
Never understood why ERP was so popular. It's just so cringey..especially when people do it in /say.
---
Just like when people use to cyber in ventrillo...weird and dumb.
---
People who want sharding are idiots. Just look at artifact reddit before release. Majority of people saying it is gonna be greatest card game of all time and white knighting every single stupid decision developers made. These people just never learn.
---
I agree with you. When TBC and flying mounts came to the game I loved it! After Wotlk hit and dungeonfinder hit i loved it for 2 weeks. Now having tried vanilla and TBC private servers with flying, I quickly got Sad thinking about how good tbc would be without flying.... Its Sad indeed
---
thats hot
---
Oh no rogues are only the second best dps class, how overrated.
---
Realmy McRealmface
---
quality!
---
Most people liked the game before that and liked it after that change. Especially me because I later a pally in TBC
---
Naked rogue rotation:
---
Cheap shot, vanish, cheap shot, cold blood, evisc, blind, re-stealth, sap, prep. re-stealth, cheap shot, vanish, cheap shot, cold blood, evisc, blind, re-stealth, sap, re-stealth, cheap shot, eviscerate. 
---
This will hit for around 4k+ if you're a naked rogue with a worn dagger.
---
"What I'm looking for:
---
1. High burst potential
---
2. High skill ceiling
---
3. Good solo PvP potential in world and BG's (so 1v1, 1vX)"  
---
Rogue, mage, warlock or spriest is what you're looking for.  
---
The classes you listed fall short in at least one category.
---
He came back.
---
Cover me! I need to wizz behind a tree.
---
I recognize a cost to mana on a physical dps, but that doesnt mean their toolset and base damage can't compensate for it, and if any class can, it would be hunter, for example, moving while dpsing, and at range. The only class that really can. This post was never about proving that hunters will do good endgame dps thought. It was about exposing reasons why we may still be wrong about how they will be, because of a real lack of data from original.
---
That's exactly what I thought too. Q3 is when its planned to be released.
---
Only the one you have. In 2.0+ you got access to your honor system highest rank.
---
I guess I'll just take your word for it.
---
I'm holding you to this now.
---
MMORNG nowadays
---
Isn't OSRS like really good though?

Bronze Dragonflight names
---
You don’t have a good poker face. She found out you were going to have fun without her.
---
It doesn't really matter because it's a video game and choosing a race shouldn't be some life altering decision, nor should you be creeped out by someone else's opinion.
---
I am mad scientist
---
Saucy
---
That or it's just the two songs they already played live.
---
did she quit school to have more time for wow?
---
Thanks for your input.
---
99% of the fun from this game is the community. You're walking in with a community of people you already know, that will be more enjoyable regardless of what races are available to you.
---
That said, I understand where you're coming from. I've played on Horde for the entirety of my WoW time. The idea of playing Alliance is tempting, but also disgusting at the same time. But if I had even a small group of friends that played this game and were going to roll Alliance, I would in a heartbeat. 
---
Your class is more important though. If you think/know you can have a good time playing a Warrior, do it man. But if you have any doubt, I'd reconsider it. 
---
I love the Horde because it felt like a band of monstrous misfits. It just felt like everything had more character to the world. 
---
The biggest bonus to playing the Horde is you get kill Gnomes. You might not understand how big of a boon that is having only played Alliance, but its literally #1 on my list of reasons to play Horde.
---
Fuck Gnomes.
---
i hope they don't do the bs marketing "mega server" crap. mega server is just a server with heavy sharding.
---
Seems fun but i think i'll die of alcohol poisoning after 3 rounds xD
---
Thank you for your input :)
---
What I like about healbot the most is that it shows how much your heal is going to heal the target. Is there a diferent UI solution to show that (show what amount your heal you are casting is going to heal)
---
Also is there a chart to show at what amount of +healing you can downrank to what rank of you heals?
---
Horde 4 life :D
---
The second they announce a classic wow token I’m not playing the game. 100% sure they are going to make a classic wow token. Go watch the videos of literally any game reporting YouTube channel I watched the quartering and a few others. They cut the GMs out of the game, they updated files in classic for the store launch, and they are in complete radio silence/reject the question when asked. Blizzard wants automation to cut costs on employees and they you can find listening to the conference call blizz had to stock shareholders. Classic is already corrupted out the gate
---
I explained why
---
You've seen the parses
---
\*shrug\*
---
They designed the classes to be relatively even while leveling. Which works OK for hunter, very strong while leveling. 
---
But once you start having your gear filled with mana it doens't work anymore
---
Both are awesome in high end pvp/pve.
---
Mages is also good at leveling, gold farming, has a lot of utility as: food/drinks, teleports.
---
Rogues, has stealth which is lifesaver in pvp servers.
---
Would recommend mage, cause leveling as rogue especially early is pain in a ass.
---
And mages can make easy money, with aoe farming.
---
Ps. i hate to rogues.
---
I tried to set it up exactly like that but I couldnt figure out what the name of the polling system was called, and it wasent offered on survey monkey either &gt;.&gt;
---
Can't? Of course it can
---
BUt it doesn't in patch 1.12
---
Lok'tar Ogar, my sisters and brothers! *FOR THE HORDE!*
---
Zero chance theres 20 servers per region given their cautious stance on underpopulated realms. 
---
I call BS.
---
"How do you kill that which has no life?"
---
Hunters have a role to fill and it's not providing top tier dps - they buff they kite and they provide ranged physical dps.
---
Druids healers have a role to fill and it's not providing top tier hps - they brez they innervate they HoT they decurse and they turn into a bear in a pinch.
---
You won't top charts with certain classes/specs but you weren't meant to - that's not your role.
---
Hi, /u/omegalulreddit
---
Love the show, buddy! Can we expect a Kevin Jordan piece on Rogues in the coming weeks?
---
dodge is sort of a trap for warrior tanking, it helps early on for sure but as you get better and better gear threat becomes a much bigger roadblock and dodging an attack grants no rage on top of humans getting weapon expertise makes them not so great tanks if all your comparing is racials and not player skill or gear.
---
The statue room in BFD is a group killer for sure. Even if you don’t have someone who doesn’t know not light all of the lamps at once, the individual packs (particularly the 4 elite turtles) are hard AF. 
---
SFK I’ve had a lot of trouble with the ghost wolves, with one pull in the room with all the hay being especially difficult.
---
While I don't agree with everything in the OP, I do agree with the most important one; that we haven't discovered all the ways wow could be ruined, and that letting the community vote for changes would be a bad idea.
---
At this point retail World of Warcraft offer close to nothing materials to build hate between factions in players. 
---
When Classic will be released and people start being grinded by same names during leveling, lose bgs to same names and have capitals raided by same names faction hate will be back.
---
&gt;There is so much to do and see and understand that we feel that the game is a bit "too big".
---
Classic is better in that regard. Levelling in modern WoW is really weird, since you will be doing only a couple of starting zones in each area before moving on, there is no storyline that makes any sense, just one long grind. 
---
&gt;so is it worth waiting for classic or will we just be bored as soon as we reach lv 60?
---
Depends on if you like how classic plays or not. You are just as likely to get bored at lvl 120 on retail. Depends on what type of game you like. 
---
From a a PvE perspective: If you like more traditional MMORPG gameplay, lots of grinding, "epic" gear, lots of downtime, and really clunky gameplay, with lots of social interaction, then you will like classic WoW. If you like the game to have a tighter storyline, streamlined fast paced combat, really challenging end game bosses, and tons of collectables (mounts, armor sets, toys, etc.), then you will like retail WoW.
---
Since both will be available under the same subscription, you'll be able to play both. Nonetheless, I found the retail endgame boring and unfulfilling without raiding or M+ runs. Questing in BfA was fun, but ultimately too short. Classic will have a longer shelf-life and will be more fun for you at endgame because the 5-man dungeons still matter, whether it's people like you wanting to have a casual run or raiders farming best-in-slot gear for either mains or alts.
---
DM is 1 thing too lol
---
Fucking same, if they're gonna give us a tiny blue post like they did last week, this weeks is probably a bigger announcement.
---
Undead warrior is pretty bad, highly contested starting area, bad leveling, could go tank if you really hate your life I guess .. it's not ugly though
---
Rethink your goals.
---
If your goal is to enjoy the game, play what you want on the faction you want. 
---
If your goal is to cater to everyone else's goals, keep doing what you're doing, but I think you'll burn out much faster.
---
Thanks again for having us on the show! :D
---
try both, seems like you didn’t play too much classic so it’s hard to really tell. also current will hold u over till classic.
---
Maybe for you. Some people have fun by optimizing their character (which is one of the key points of an MMO, might I add).
---
uhh did you even SEE him sawing that boat in half?
---
True but that's just the demand side. If it's anything like vanilla, there will be less druids playing (supply), so it does balance (no pun intended) out a little.
---
\&gt;20 servers by region
---
\&gt;hope for OCE servers
---
uh oh.
---
If you liked taking your time, liked interacting with the world and other players, liked clearly defined class roles (including each class and spec not being able to do everything!), and liked your original experience, you will want Classic.
---
What you won’t get is the casual raid experience. You can dungeon at 60 as a casual, I did it before and plan to do it again (life and career and all that). Raids are a different matter. At least at first. I imagine after a while some guilds and/or guild alliances will be far enough along to put together a less-intense early raid, just as they did before.
---
Hopefully next week! Kevin was just a bit sick and his voice was shot this past week, so we put it off, but he'll be back better than ever soon :)
---
Classic is a better MMORPG in just about every way. If you want modern MMO like new WoW then I'd play something different like ESO
---
Ok. Let's say you're running Ulduman and Pendulum of Doom drops. It's a BoE supertwink weapon generally worth around 1000g. What do you think is the proper way to go about it? 
---
For all that wants to make that enhancement supertwink, they will either farm Ulduman or spend 1000g for that item, but what about the normal levelers? 
---
Is it worth "wasting" 1000g by using it as an upgrade you really don't need, or is it better to have enough money to buy all the pre-bis items and enchants for level 60? 
---
This is the whole point on needing on the random BoE drops as a group, because players need money. It prevents one person from ninjalooting it because the BoE loot is concidered as gold, not an upgrade.
---
And the most important point I will come with is this: always just talk with the party as you are forming about looting, you have plenty of time to come to an agreement by the time you get to the dungeon.
---
This is of course what I got used to playing on a private server, so I will not say that it was like this back in the day. I have no idea how it was like then.
---
With the attunement quests in deadmines
---
Bonjour, Diamond Jim
---
I don't think anybody ever called it SHV, that would have never made sense.
---
Blizzard will find a way to change classic, get it full of micro transactions like stupid mounts etc and battle pets. Anything that makes up for the fiasco that BFA is. 
---
Ps. Vanilla belongs to the community, not to their greasy greedy hands.

Gonna have lots of oldschool WoW bands to listen to.
---
Hmm, would you say the two games are different enough such that playing one won't degrade the experience of the other? Like, if I play modern WoW first, will I open Classic when it comes out and feel that a lot of things are lacking?
---
Pedophobe? Like people afraid of pedophiles? .... so you mean like normal people? Lets not normalize kiddie diddlers by validating a fear a of them.
---
Tried mage on an undocumented server and was surprised at how boring and rewarding they felt. Compared to my warrior, they didn't really care for gear, and what gear they had was ugly dresses. You didn't care about food or water, so professions like cooking and fishing didn't feel like they mattered, same with first aid. Blink felt annoying too even if it is great in theory because you need to click it every 15s to be most efficient.

Go ally man, and "deus vult" those savages into the ground.

As a tank i would go for Nelf - for dodge buff
---
As dmg dealer probably as human for weapon training and more importantly rep bonuses.
---
As a Canadian I appreciate the Global TV watermark.
---
Pedophobe is being afraid of children..
---
Its respectable. I'd say middle of the pack in terms of leveling speed.  Fun is subjective, but I enjoyed leveling mine. 
---
Not to spoil the game for you, but every class is basically what you described. In vanilla you basically press 1-2 buttons. Mages cast Frostbolt until things die. Warlocks cast shadowbolt until things die. Paladins cast Flash of Light. Shamans cast Chain Heal. Druids cast Rank Healing Touch. 
---
Almost every class is like this. If you want to heal and have the most options at your disposal, Priest is where its at. They have small/fast heals, medium/medium heals, big/slow heals, the best HoT, bubbles, maybe something I forgot.
---
&gt; That has nothing to do with this conversation.
---
I think it does. Sub-optimal classes, specs, mounts, rep grinds etc. are part of the appeal of vanilla for a lot of people. Not everything has to be optimal.
---
&gt;A game should be fun even without that.
---
TBC was lots of fun. If you didn't have fun that's a problem on your end.
---
&gt; Good job ignoring the last part entirely. Even if we assume it is group PvP, it is still non-functional.
---
It functioned fine. You realise that you are no different here to people who think it's unfair if they can't get an instance group? Boo hoo, you can't complete a world PvP objective that requires a group if you don't have the social skills or social connections to get a group together. That's functioning as intended.
---
There is different equipments other than water walking iirc. So classes with water walking can just use other equipments
---
My pleasure mate!
---
Maraudon is in stage 1.
---
This meme needs to go away. At least for a while. It was a good couple of weeks, we had fun, but it’s enough.
---
Wow, people work hard to not play the game.
---
God damn it I'm so ready to play.
---
A rogue doesn't need all their cooldowns every fight to win.
---
"But kill the bastards anyway"
---
Hahaha. Can't wait till Classic release &lt;3 !
---
Someone called me a dramatic clown for saying these pop up daily :(
---
A dick to who?  Yourself?  It only hurts you to click off the buff.  Most people probably don't know you even did it, and would have buffed you regardless... so...
---
That’s my endgame.
---
Been playing rogue on pserver and bgs suck if you don't like defending flags or aren't part of an overwhelmingingly overgeared team, most wsgs/abs if you try to join in the group pvp you get tab targeted and deleted if you  are anywhere near the frontlines
---
Do you know that Article 13 can affect WoW steaming? Even screenshots...
---
Ah ok. When people say "pedo" you know what they are referring to.
---
Try priest
---
If it’s vs any competent player, it does.
---
&gt;the quartering
---
Telling me to go watch the ramblings of a Jeremy Hambly in the hopes that I find something from his "insiders" is still not a valid source, sorry. Let's just leave this here, it's not going to go anywhere. When Classic has no cash shop remember this thread and stop watching sensationalist Youtuber garbage as your "reporting"
---
They've already fronted the bill for classic.  Hell, 100 subs with 15$ recurring payments would pay for the server maintenance and a community rep.
---
Nostalgia is a perfectly valid reason to give something a try. That druid swim form quest will be there in classic if you want to revisit it. And as others have pointed out, both versions of the game will be covered by the same subscription fee.
---
Actually rolling like 4 druid heals looks beneficial cause of hot's. And b resses espeacially in aq-nax.
---
I could go as far as saying that druids&gt;priest in super endgame.
---
But in any case pallys are the best healers in vanilla for ally(insane efficiency)
---
So about that raid experience. I'm not first-hand up to date with modern WoW's features, I read that you can raid casually in pick-up groups quite easily now due to the dungeon finder and other social tools. I presume those won't be present in Classic.
---
I don't have the time (yeah life and career) to dedicate to anything but the most casual guild, but I like experiencing cool raids. I gather that you can raid casually in modern WoW, but in Classic it'll be much rougher to find such an experience. Is that a tradeoff I definitely have to make? Or am I missing something
---
Gimme some lottery numbers - just for research things
---
Ad a troll warrior in vanilla, go tauren!
---
Troll racials are there worst in vanilla. You need tauren stamina as a tank in vanilla.
---
Welcome to Orgrimmar! Have you come, to serve the Horde?
---
Dang you were rich
---
If you’re in the same time zone as server time, then yes, basically.
---
they are two different games. imo the only variable atm is whether or not you end up liking current wow more than classic once you play it. and at that moment it doesn’t matter cuz your enjoying yourself in the end soooo i would give it a try.
---
Funny thing. Easiest class to do DME lashers is imo a priest. Sure, it might take you slightly longer than mage pulling all the packs at once, but you can do it blindfolded. And you are going to hit the max number of instances on every class, it depends if you are grinding somewhere else (or another char) for the remaining time after the CD.
---
But mages have BRD, ZG etc where they can make a TON of gold if thats doable.
---
Our guild prioritized Onyxia bags to Tanks, then Warlocks for that very reason :D
---
I love gnomes.
---
I wish it was daily...That someone who called you that, is one of them "THIS WILL BE GREAT IDEA" and when asked "why" they give a silent downvote.
---
Yes. My hate for the horde has been going strong since I saw the lumber camps in Ashenvale. If it's creepy I don't want to be not-creepy.
---
Most people will be plebs
---
A good 40 man raid will roll over 3x their numbers if they're gruouped up 
---
Gold goes a long way in vanilla. Unless you're talking 3x imbalance it's not gonna be an issue if you play your class anywhere near it's ceiling
---
Do you think BGs be viable or will people mostly be doing raids?
---
You mean someone attacked them while they were engaged with 2 mobs and were below half hp fair?
---
But that 25g bank slot too pricey lol
---
I ain't saying there aren't status symbols now though.  You can still feel like you won the first place prize by getting the Mythic Dazzarlor gear.  Who in vanilla would be able to farm Tier 1 by themselves.  The only reason you see a lot of pallys in judgement and whatnot now is because that is shite gear now.   I am not for transmog in vanilla, I don't care, I will still play it, but it just seems pretty pathetic that people cling to a series of pixels as some sort of status symbol.
---
Thanks. I asked someone else this too: do you think that the two experiences are different enough that I can enjoy both if I do retail (ah I see, not modern) WoW before Classic? Like, will I be thinking why I'm doing the same area/quests two times over?
---
I don't remember having that much, but also don't remember even sending any to this character. It was actually lost on an old account of mine on a school email address. Ended up talking to blizzard a few years ago who got it attached to my bnet.
---
I was always farming tyr's hand, the place for crusader enchant and the winter spring demons and I did get a few decent drops so I was comfortable.
---
Haha I see, thanks for the advice :)
---
I’ve played a tiny bit of wotlk if u call that modern. Of course you can’t mount in combat but combat drops quick when u cc someone. And I for example prefer outdoor pvp over bgs where u get stomped by premade or war with pocket healer. Silith and felwood herb pvp is glorious and I don’t main a rogue
---
Some people want to experience something different and thats fine. I see a lot of people on this subreddit swapping factions in classic. I personally think people put a little to much thought into min/maxing with racials, but different people get different things out of the game.
---
For instance, Tauren Druids are probably preferred for War Stomp, but even though I've only ever played Horde, if I committed to playing a Druid in classic, it'd be Night Elf just because I've never been able to get past the starting zone on Tauren. I just don't enjoy being a cow.
---
Personally I haven't played the game since the first week of Catas release, I don't think I care very much which faction I end up playing on. I've teetered back and forth so many times in the last few weeks lol
---
It's much more about Shaman or Paladin than anything else
---
And the answer is obviously Paladin
---
I always wondered why people called it that.
---
Lol.
---
&gt;That one will work. There's another version of healbot that auto-targets the lowest person in a raid, and casts the appropriate downranked healing spell.
---
Which is something you should avoid doing regardless. The addon will not factor in damage that is incoming during the cast, and it will ignore other healers casting on the same target.
---
The AddOn also will never be able to prioritize. A human will let the rogue die if it means saving the tank (and the raid) for death. The AddOn will just blindly heal whoever.
---
I googled it to check if it was Darkshore, its not there in retail WoW anymore? Man!
---
Ofcourse you can. It's a great set for Druids.
---
it’s almost art that it ends to soon. makes it funnier (if you know the episode i guess)
---
I see, thanks for the advice :)
---
Thank you so much for being one of the only content creators to address the RP-PVP issue.
---
Thats something that would be discussed prior to the run brither, i think its a given that something worth 1000g would either be reserved or open to rolls.
---
When i started in Wrath i didnt have a buff (was playing a warlock) and soul shards were still kind of a pain.  Of course we  already had soulwell at the time, so in dungeons i was giving cookies, but out in the world it was kind of a pain.
---
Will be playing priest this time, and im definitely looking forward to being able to buff :)
---
Had some bank alts :P
---
Why? It's a really good set for both of them. Shadowcraft doesnt say "Rogue" on the set.
---
SHV would make sense if instead of being called Stranglethorn Vale, it was called StrangleHorn vale.  Which is what the previous poster thought it was called, hence not understanding the STV abbreviation
---
I’m rolling Rogue pretty set on that. Playing alliance as I always have. 
---
I want to roll dwarf rogue, but I want to raid and wpvp. Got a fair bit of spare time and can commit to this over the next year. 
---
Will I have a harder time getting into a raid group not playing human (I understand they get a 3-5% dps increase with swords and swords are bis)? 
---
I would be open to rolling for daggers to secure a spot come raid time but in a perfect world get swords.
---
Reason for being dwarf is I just feel they have the objectively better racial, for my overall experience as I’ll slowly drift to more pvp when I have got some gear however long it takes.
---
Priests also have the option of running two-man operations with a Warrior, Rogue or even druid. Same goes for any other healer but I feel that priests might be the best. DM E boss runs with a warrior = GOLD!
---
New Tool album + wow classic release, 2019 is the year where dreams come true.
---
Half life 3 coming up next ?? :)
---
Because while Str give you 2.4 attackpower, agility still gives 1. It also gives you crit which increase your combo point generation through blood frenzy.
---
Str isnt bad, its just Agi is better in almost every circumstance.
---
The original cinematic still looks gorgeous. Especially considering when the game was first released.
---
Could you at least pretend to be a blizzard person leaking info so I can be excited for a few moments?
---
If you're not clicking your abilities and using the arrow keys then gtfo.
---
Same here except I was a Nelf Druid in Stormwind looking at another Nelf druid in t3.
---
Highmountain is my favourite zone post Wrath precisely because it feels like a real mountainous place and not something designed for me to easily get around.
---
&gt;There was tons of theorycrafting in vanilla days. There were tons of fan sites dedicated to it specifically..
---
Most of the Vanilla theorycrafting was done for the more mainstream classes. First of all, Feral wasnt very good for the first half of Vanilla when they got their talent revamp.
---
Secondly, almost every single Druid played healer. The number of people that would be interested in actually theorycrafting the spec would be so few its likely the theorycrafting was either never done, or not made properly available to the public.
---
Your main spec is whatever you show up to raid in. Raid gear is prioritized to players that will use that gear to down bosses quicker. How is giving items to you so you can pvp, vs  that ele shammy who will use the gear in raid AND everywhere else u plan to a good idea?
---
 TLDR; why the hell should you get any gear over somebody’s mainspec.
---
That's the spirit!

---
The redid the entire 1-60 continent so almost none of the old quests are left. Might be fun to compare the two once classic is out.
---
Sounds like your remembering good times with an ex girlfriend but blocking all the shit for those sweet member-berries
---
It’s undead or nothing. Hail Sylvannas!
---
Who said they want changes? It seems as if op is against changes.
---
BRD boots are slightly better for Rogues/Warriors/Ferals as they have 4 Str as well.
---
I have recently almost convinced myself that I should go Human Priest instead of NE but this thread is making me think I'm really going to miss Shadowmeld's usefulness if I go Human.
---
Don’t sweat ra
---
Facts
---
shut up....
---
Yeah, all of the classic zones got reworked during cataclysm expansion, and leveling is much faster in retail, so you just breeze through 1-60 in retail. Some zones are still the same in looks, but quests got changed I think everywhere, or Ill say 90% of them were changed to stay on the safe side. So as far as leveling experience go its totally different. And the same goes for endgame, where basically everything is changed, from dungeon, raids to pvp systems.
---
If it gets posted that often obviously there's another camp. Not 10,000,000 vs OP, Perspective bro
---
Who gets to be on the council? You know as well as I do it would be streamers.
---
Open world? Mage
---
In instance? Hunter because of feign death can do some crazy things skipping packs and kiting. Arrows not a problem because of instance reset limit
---
Hunter is best overall
---
Mage 2, but again better in instance. Def number 1 if only in the open world
---
Assuming you mean starting at lvl 1, you will find that the starter zones are exactly the same up until you reach area(s) changed in Cataclysm. Main difference being that you'll progress through retail much, MUCH faster. So if you do that first, then move directly to Classic, you could get frustrated with the slower pace of leveling.
---
ok nerd
---
This feeling but in black rock dungeons, while pvp characters from opposite faction are waiting for you and you need to call pvp players to help your team entrance, becoming a huge battle
---
me too thanks
---
It’s fine because I’ve already recruited a few people
---
Gonna be playing classic? Also dwarf rogue wtf dude
---
TLDR... heading straight into pvp zones.
---
&gt;  I have other things to do in life than just play one game. 
---
Haha yeah....
---
me: working on rank 10 on my main and my alt....
---
TBH in Vanilla it's not a huge game changer. It makes things easier and a little faster but with how slow paced vanilla is and the fact that your optimal rotation is going to consist of, 1,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,3,3 clicking isn't the end of the world. Just easier once you grasp it.
---
You have to be insane to believe it will cover the Barrens. It's a zone that spans up to the 30s. Common sense, come on.

For any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)
---
Madseason is the absolute best. I don’t get the monotone thing. Who cares even then. His vids are the best.
---
I have zero love for my faction. So little love that I switched over to kill my own kind. LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Jokes aside I just pick the faction where my guild or friends play.
---
I always liked playing on the smaller faction, because I like world PvP a lot. 
---
But man it's so not fair for the lesser pop on an extremely unbalanced server, like 70/30 or worse. The lesser faction doesn't stand a chance to get world boss kills. Cross realm stuff only really helps the larger faction by removing the one negative (queue times) they have, while it doesn't do anything for the small faction, or the actual problem.
---
Like if you choose a server to play on a dominant faction, then you should expect to get the negatives that go with it (queue times), because the other faction is getting boned by not being able to kill world bosses, unless the dominant side wants to let them.
---
I hope blizz has an idea to handle this problem. A solution I've heard was to add a balance queue, where if the ratio gets too big, then that faction gets hit with a queue, while the other faction can freely log in. 
---
Anyone that complains about a queue really misses the point of the issue. Like we get hit with queues all the time on large servers, so why not use that as a faction balancing mechanism?
---
Nah people get pissed they wasted mana.
---
Westfall is straight up not good for leveling compared to Darkshore, Loch Modan, Redridge... But it's the closest thing we Alliance players have to The Barrens, and I'm gonna poke my head in anyway. if only for Moonbrook shenanigans.
---
HUH
---
Good to hear. But you may recruit more if you were forthcoming! You're missing out on at least one guy ATM ;)
---
Supposedly there’s a mechanic in at least some versions of WoW in which there are diminishing returns for quest items not dropping, so hopefully this is implemented in Classic as well.
---
Classic isn't out yet. So go play retail to see why classic is the right choise.
---
Honestly it's just way to soon to discuss "after naxx" but if classic can maintain more success than BFA+, then I think it would be great to do an alternative timeline, something like the portal never gets opened or whatever, and classic splits off in to it's own set of expansions.
---
The major differences would to keep it more line with classic and keep 40 man raids too, but no LFG or Raid finder, or others changes that killed that social aspect of the game.
---
The entirety of Azeroth was revamped with Cataclysm, so there should be very few quests that are the same. Quests in WoW are generally kill x amount of someone or pick up x amount of something, but personally those quests feel more rewarding to do in the old game because how combat worked, being a tad more difficult. There should also be a lot more group-based quests while leveling compared to the current version.
---
&gt; Some zones are still the same in looks, but quests got changed I think everywhere, or Ill say 90% of them were changed to stay on the safe side. So as far as leveling experience go its totally different.
---
Ah I see! That makes it more appealing for me to play both then haha
---
Emerald dream and burning crusade pls oh heck yeah
---
I’m not saying no progress post naxx. I’m saying a new form of progress, keep the lvls at 60 so they can evenly balance levelling with end game and not run into the levelling problem they have with retail (some enjoy that side of wow).
---
If you enjoy levelling in retail right now, I applaud you, it isn’t for me.
---
New End game raids could have a harder entry cap unlike the current LFR/not really existent Normal mode. 
---
Pvp could receive a few balance tweaks (this is all post naxx #nochanges) arenas could still be added.
---
All this content could be taken from the current game just scaled in a way for level 60. 
---
All this could be built after and they could essentially avoid the problems/remove the complaining from current retail players who have continuously played and have insane hours/mounts and would be upset with the level squish/makes buying the expansions kind of irrelevant if people didn’t have to level in them. 
---
I’m not against progression, I currently play BFA as I have every expansion. It would be awesome to go back to certain periods of my gametime when there was no other game that could even come close to what was going on in wow at that time. I love it, I just think we could go back in a different less issues and keep the core experience of vanilla throughout while future patches could change meta, they could add a couple of moves here and there where they work.
---
I see, thanks for the tip!
---
I definitely misread his comment. I thought he was saying, "Back then people said SHV" but I guess he was saying "With my thinking it would've been SHV which doesn't make sense" Whoops.
---
^sonuvabitch
---
If you can't PvP and use your tools only when needed you don't really belong in PvP. It's not often you have all your long CD abilities on CD at the same time. If they are, some will be close to finished.
---
Because it is literally useless and uses up prime hotkey real estate. Im sure its fine for most of vanillas raiding though.
---
i'm fully grinding there in classic, you're minted!
---
It doesn't matter unless you're in a hardcore guild. Im playing human because I like the looks and I like the animations and the warrior sets so just play what gives you the most joy
---
release date, but just because I have my last exam next week and then half a year free time. I understand that most of you rather have a quicker announcement so you can plan ahead.
---
And they did. In one single episode. "Long" night my ass
---
My favorite casual classes are Druid, Hunter, and Warlock. Good solo potential, all fun in PvP imo.
---
Clever. Here's an upvote.
---
Yes, later in the game they will be. They're the strongest class in the game with good gear. Does that make Rogues extremely overrated and unuseful? Does it make ALL classes unuseful? No. They're also very strong in group PvP while Rogues are better for small skirmishes. Your point?
---
As someone with several thousand hours in OSRS, I believe they should wait until the game is firmly dead/stale before even considering changing a thing. The content they add is good, some of the time and it most certainly keeps the game going, but the soul of the original game is very much gone. 
---
Also worth considering that Jagex are a bunch of underpaid graduates who routinely fuck up everything and butcher the management of the game in many ways, blizzard should do much better.
---
July 30th, it is known
---
Oto’s rogue guide has pre DM bis.
---
Alliance Priests will still get roles even if they're Nelfs or Humans. But Fear Ward is *stupidly* good, so you're doing yourself a metagaming disservice by not playing it.
---
If you really can't stand Dwarves, then Humans are better than Nelfs for the Spirit bonus.
---
Why is your human rogue so short
---
Casters are easy in PvE, more nuanced in PvP. Lotta options as a caster in objective pvp like WSG. Warlock is very complex relative to most classes in PvP. Just picking the optimum curse for ur target at any given moment alone is more complex thinking than most classes do all game
---
So it begins...
---
Based on my impressions of this sub so far I believe yes, I have a very unconventional plan: I'm not making a plan. I'll just go where the journey takes me.
---
Then you should focus on having a little bit more health, get atleast 5k health and focus on taking out clothies and healers in group PvP. A simple stunlock on a healer could win that fight.
---
They should have let expansions be expansions, a package that expands the current world. Not change it. I'm fine with going up 10 levels if you buy the expansion, but don't touch the leveling of 1-60. If you don't buy the expansions you can't level to 70, or go to new zones, fine but you can still take your time to get to naxx and maybe later you will join. And you don't need seperate TBC servers for this, just lock the 60+ content.
---
I think they went overboard by changing the whole game with every expansion, trying to attract old players back by introducing new classes, races, mounts, gameoptions, that all affect the basis of the game that is classic.
---
Nostalrius
---
Definitely playing! dwarf... biggest regret of my life. I needed to farm that gold to feed my nogginfogger and savory delight nightly requirements.
---
Well I gotchu.
---
But the raid times are t set in stone yet and neither is the name
---
You couldn’t be more wrong. 
---
First off, I am a married female so your ex-girlfriend scenario is off base. Second, I have been playing WoW since launch and loved Vanilla and TBC. I don’t know what shit you are referring to because that’s when the game was most fun and immersive. For me it started going downhill in Wrath as the game got streamlined with QOL’s I didn’t like. Third, I hate the new models and can’t wait to recreate the cute female gnomes and dwarves I used to love.
---
I think they could easily support healthy populations for both changes and no changes.
---
Personally I think down the line I want to see changes, as a person who primarily enjoys the game for its pvp aspect when naxx is on farm and you can literally die in 2 globals from a decked out shaman it loses most of its appeal for me.
---
On the other hand I respect that some people want 1.12 forever and I don't want to take that from them.
---
The only sensible thing I can think of is allowing both kinds of servers, the population is gonna die down after a few years either because people are tired of the same thing, they want "freshl servers, or because they want changes. I think whatever keeps the most people satisfied is the way to go.
---
Pretty sure wow had close to 7m by the time BC launched. But 100k is respectable. 
---
I imagine this launch will be higher than vanilla peak. 5m currently in retail will give it a whirl and all returning players not curly subbed. They'll have heaps on their plate. Pretty sure they want to be ready.
---
It's going to be awesome playing on a pve server and just doing STV like a normal quest hub and then doing pvp in battlegrounds where there won't be people 30 levels higher than me waiting to gank me for the lolz. :)
---
Wait, READ?  You're nuts.
---
Seriously though, the game is more interesting when you don't immediately know where to go or have all the answers.
---
Why is stv a problem? I understand due to pvpers but why should it be a problem? I mean you literally lose nothing when dieing in Classic (thanks to project ascension here :))))
---
Name checks out
---
They should only allow level 60 people to vote, maybe with a certain amount of content cleared too. In OSRS you have to reach a certain total skill level to vote and it ensures that you have to be at least somewhat dedicated to the game to vote.
---
Hunter for my solo main.
---
Shaman for my group of friends.
---
Rogue to play with my girlfriend.
---
Ahhhh. Interesting. Okay, I'll chat with you later today when I'm done with work.
---
Vanilla bags and bank is like porn to me.
---
Thanks for sharing. Awesome stuff
---
All things being equal, a dwarf will get invited over the other races, ime. Fear ward isn't really needed, but it makes some things a loot easier.
---
Also fear ward is really nice in world PvP. 
---
In reality, if you're a priest, and healing, you're probably getting a raid invite no matter your race.
---
The first mistake you made is believing there's gonna be a new TOOL album. You don't believe a new TOOL album is out until 1 week after release. That's just basic knowledge.
---
Lol I have no intention of playing on a pvp server. I prefer end game pve. Horde ganking me while leveling is just a massive waste of my time.
---
Paladins are by far the strongest pure support in the game
---
Seal of light &gt; all aoe healing lol
---
And all 5 mans you can just CC the shit out of everything. And there are plenty of non class specific items to help you do that.
---
What sound is more annoying over 60 levels: gun or bow?

Always liked the "reflection" effect that the moon/sun leave on the ground in WoW. In literally every game now, but at the time it was impressive. Games were just starting to introduce shiny effects.
---
AfterNaxx
---
There's always a bigger fish
---
What do you have against regular periods my man? :P
---
FYI you're completely wrong about dwarves looking stupid in cloth. Huge shoulders make any gear look dope
---
its not that bad lol.. i played an UD warrior in classic and it was fine.
---
i did the dps, pvp and tank stuff on him.. cannibalize was helpful when i was pvping or grinding on humanoid mobs and WOTF was useful in pve and pvp situations.
---
all the starting areas are going to really suck except maybe tauren and then even theirs will suck.. leveling a warrior sucks in general compared to other classes i think they take the longest to lvl to 60
---
It takes longer to get to 40 than 120.

---
My dad still does this
---
The plan is roll horde. Lok’Tar ogar!
---
This was well done and funny. Thanks!
---
Can't be sure there isn't a rogue camping in a tent waiting for you.
---
Yes. Shadowcraft is not bis for rogues. I’d only roll on it if it was better than what I have. Id replace it for a bis item though.
---
Hmm yes up to 20% more damage is no bug difference
---
You’ll say the same thing when WoW2 classic comes out in 2030
---
5k health is like pissing on a house fire at aq+ levels of gear, 2.5k + spell crits are very common and you will usually die before the cheap shot wears off if the enemy team is competent
---
A little disappointed on all the paladin speakers focusing on a /sit macro that has zero guarantee being usable in classic. Nice podcast overall though.
---
Immediately moving an alt all the way to winterspring, to serve as a bank character and also camp the vendors for recipes.
---
At home. Playing league of legends. Facechecked a bush and got oneshotted by a fat stacked Nasus.
---
Suddently I see flashes before me of targets with "Skull" level. I hear stealth noices or see a big instand pyroblast flying toworths me.
---
This was last week.
---
I dream alot about classic lately.
---
According to the data, hunter is in the bottom 4 for intended mains... just druid, shaman and paladin are lower... and shaman and pally are only available on one faction (so there will actually be more of each per faction than hunters).  
---
The most popular are Warrior, Mage, Priest, Warlock, Rogue ... in that order.  
---
I think this is because, with hindsight, people are trying to pick the "best" classes... and hunter has gotten a bad rap with the whole "dps falls off toward the end" stuff. On the other hand, "priests are best healers" and "warlocks are great dps with gear" have boosted those numbers higher than what happened in vanilla (where there were more hunters, I believe). All just theories.... and, of course, based on that survey. :D
---
No, but it will impact my server choice.
---
I’m planning on rolling an undead warrior main and a Tauren Hunter alt for a more pleasant and easier experience in contrast. I would like to raid with one (or idealistically both in a perfect world) without falling TOO far behind. 
---
I know it’s not the ideal race class combo, but is this a decent play? I plan on putting some decent elbow grease in.
---
what will likely be the most played classes come release?  i am thinking rogue, mage, hunter and warrior.
---
i don't want to play something that will be super overplayed so i am thinking warlock.  is that a safe bet?
---
I’ll be a rogue. I can’t wait.
---
No you need the same amount of hunters the whole time
---
Because of "tranq shot" a skill given in MC that greatly reduces boss damage. Also hunters are excellent kiters and great if u want a kitable mob to disappear for a couple minutes
---
They're more specialists
---
What you will miss out on is being on top of the charts. No one will respect your DPS. But good hunters who show up are invaluable. Even the best raids can be wiped if you try to replace your good hunter with one who has no idea what's going on and really fucks it all up. 
---
Like multishotting a couple extra packs whle kiting or something
---
I tend to buff Warrs and Rogue with Int when I see them, and there response is:
---
"Why buff me with Int, I don't have any mana?" &lt; them
---
"I knew you were too stupid to understand before I buffed you, but I figured you'd be smart enough afterwards."  &lt; me.
---
Awww my gnome warrior has the rank of Knight-Captain too. I PVP’s with her until Spring of 2006 when I joined a raiding guild 😊😊.
---
Perhaps a controversial opinion, but the retail game is so accessible that you could easily take a decent bite of it by the time classic is out. It give you something to do, get you into the universe a bit, and build some appreciation for just why classic is so goddam good.
---
As a mega fan of Tool AND Half-Life, things were looking pretty bleak for me these last eleven goddamn years. 
---
But now finally something is happening!!!
---
This is the beginning and the end mortals. None may enter the master's sanctum.
---
I didn't realise we were debating... Smile! :) I was poking fun at the sentiment.
---
Based. I'm fairly set on Dwarf though.
---
I hope no one is actually taking advices from wow classic memes...
---
spellpower sucks it's way better in earlier versions
---
They fucked hpalas with this no tier item progression shit.
---
The only good hpala pvp set in the game won't be out til nax. T1 to T2 is barely an upgrade. T1 is hybrid dogshit in 1.12 and T2 is spellpower dogshit
---
Ok bubble boy.
---
&gt; but your education stays forever with you. 
---
My brain's memory department would disagree.
---
My most memorable experience came from being on a PvP server. While a leveling holy priest (I was an idiot). Fearing /wanding my way through some annoying gather quest. And I kept getting my mobs stolen by friendly alliance. Too many people I was too slow. I was about to quit the quest and come back in the night when a 60(skull to me at least) troll rogue pops out stealth and kills all the alliance players around. I'm talking 10+  characters. Then they /bow to me and /point at the mobs and then goes back into stealth. They followed me the rest of the evening clearing every quest area of alliance allowing me to breeze through my evening of questing. I will never forgot that evening and the keks in chat. I will be rolling on PvP with the intention of creating/ having dynamic experiences like that. Oh and getting ganked until I throw my keyboard out the window. 
---
Also now I am late for work.
---
Druid is least played I believe.
---
So no?, But also yes?
---
My head hurts
---
Vanilla era me would have been very excited about this image, I'll give you that.
---
Well it depends on your major and her life goals as well. If she wants a family and you want to go do a masters in Continental Philosophy, this isn't gonna work out well for either of you.
---
Doesn't mean there wasn't a lot of stuff to still figure and discover over the last 15 years. There was lots of science and math in ancient Greece but guess what there are still advancement being made to this day.
---
Thinking about rolling a troll mage. Change my mind
---
Its good but not needed 
---
Play what you enjoy most
---
Only five encounters have fear, all are easy ones
---
My tier list of vanilla wow dungeons with the first dungeon in line on the tiers being the best and the later being a bit worse but still in the same tier.  
---
S Tier: Sunken Temple, Blackrock Depths  
---
A Tier: Maraudon, Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps, Wailing Caverns  
---
B Tier: Uldaman, Scholomance, Zul'Farrak, Scholomance  
---
C Tier: Gnomeregan, Deadmines, Razorfen Downs, Scarlet Monastery(Graveyard&gt;Armory&gt;Cathedral&gt;Library)  
---
D Tier: Dire Maul, Lower Blackrock Spire, The Stockades, Razorfen Kraul, Ragefire Chasm
---
play what you like.. nothing wrong with an UD warrior i did everything on it. I tanked up to bwl(switched mains) and did well at  pvp.
---
even tauren hunter is fine just do it if thats what you want to do and you are not super concerned about the dps increase trolls give
---
??? but mind control is channeled...?
---
But sitting in queue won't make you delete all your chars and re roll. It's more a long term issue
---
All pve healing in vanilla is simple. YOu just down rank and spam efficient heals
---
It's the most complex healer in pvp beyond shaman. Totems add a lot of complexity
---
Auras, blessings, occasionally seals. Plus you have unique ability to remove physical debuffs
---
A lot of shit to maintain if shaman's didn't have to place totems Paladin would be most complex by a wide margin
---
I swear Murlocs have a wider aggro range than any other mob in the game.
---
No they aren't these would be better for tank https://classicdb.ch/?item=18716 and these would be better for cat https://classicdb.ch/?item=12553
---
PvP - Server... 
---
be prepared for random horde players to have your back... 
---
Almost any time I played alliance in vanilla or pserv it was a true coin toss if a passerby would assist you in a fight against the opposing faction.
---
When I played horde it felt like 9/10 passerbys would help you vanquish your alliance foes. This camaraderie gave me the love for the horde. I don't hate the alliance game play I am right there with your sentiments, but I feel like I belong to something greater when I play along side the horde.
---
I would totally say you could Play both without the Feeling of doing things multiple times. They are pretty much different games now. 
---
Classic is much more about the journey to max Level - building a relationship to your character and have lots of Little exciting achievements.
---
Retail it is more like leveling is a small hurdle to climb to finally reach the real game at Level 120. Then you will be doing raids, farming and M+ and ofc PVP :P
---
Classic is superior IMHO - but there is plenty of People that say different so you gotta make up your own mind :P
---
Channeled yes but you are allowed to cast one instant cast spell that takes effect on either yourself or a target before the spell technically ends. This is something private servers got wrong and on live servers you could do it.
---
I like trolls as well but their racials are by far the weakest of the horde.
---
Beast Slaying is terrible except in PvE fights vs beasts, there are not many of those.
---
Regeneration is ~5 health per second, this is nothing.  
---
Throwing Specialization.  
---
Bow specialization is nice if you are playing hunter, not much else.
---
Berserking is the only decent racial but it's the only racial that costs Rage/Energy/Mana to use.
---
The other racial is the priests Shadow Guard, I'd probably roll a troll if I went with a horde priest since this is very good in PvP / PvE solo.
---
Druid the better hybrid
---
Paladin the better healer
---
it worked 15 years ago, it will work now also. If you are in a casual guild or pvp guild that dont min/max the debuff you wont care.   
---
And also since you say GL. count 16 debuffs that will be used in phase 1. that will make it so MS wont work.
---
I'm gonna go and assume you're just as old as most people here were around actual vanilla times.
---
Thanks for the answers guys, i cant find any video showing dwarfs casting animation from back then, any1 know where i can find it? After what i rememver the females have a pretty cool casting animation?
---
You Think You Do But You Don't
---
Getting spots will be easy with both, both are meta builds
---
Dwarf Priest will be more in demand because for some reason people think they don't need fear ward. If ur on a pvp server there is no excuse not to be dwarf priest lol
---
All things being equal you always take the dwarf priest next to the other two races.
---
Look into the shaman 30/0/21 spec. Slays in pvp with enough ass to heal in pve
---
Bikini Bottom
---
Well, I'm not in your boat but I'm glad you finally get to experience the real World of Warcraft :)
---
Have you ever played on a high pop server, where so many people are trying to play you have to sit in a queue of like 250 before you can log in? And it affects both factions, including the faction that makes up 30% of the server. So like instead of this, have it hit the dominant faction, letting the lesser side to bypass it, maybe resulting in a balancing mechanism.
---
Tier 1, 2 and 3 with benedict on dwarfs do look stoooopid good imo :) but yea dwarf &gt; human &gt; nelf
---
Classic is the best for WoW beginners. The current live version is a clusterfuck of various features left over from too many versions that just don't mesh well anymore. Classic is a single coherent world with a gentle learning curve that a beginner can wrap their head around, but with enough depth to keep you busy for years.
---
Why are you using Iblis in your MH and AQR in your offhand?
---
Well with shamans / paladins you have a different faction. Do you have a preference on faction or no?
---
What are your goals for the game? high end raiding? casual raiding? PVP? open world vs bgs?
---
groups can use all of those and raids will have spots for them.  in rolling a priest so biased there but really play what is fun.  Priest has a better healing kit while paladin and shamans have more support kit with heals.
---
yeah but i don't want to play druid i guess i am just wondering if warlocks will be really popular or just chill around the middle somewhere.
---
considering you may only bring 1 or 2 to a raid.
---
I really like the feeling of helping the group rather than maximizing my DPS. Tank or priest would be obvious choices but I already played tank in Vanilla/BC. 
---
So what other options are there if I want to bring support and buffs for the group/raid? Shaman healer? Warlock with imp? DPS classes, who do you absolutely love to have in your group and why? Whose buffs do you covet the most?
---
“Relashionships” 
---
“Education is important people!”
---
Ummmmmmm.
---
I can’t really help you with your wand dilemma, but I like the title of your post. Does completing every single Alliance quest in each zone, including profession quests, dungeon quests and even PVP quests, no matter how slow or annoying, all at the appropriate level before they turn gray, count as “unconventional”?
---
https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
Lol to each their own. I just do bgs if I want to pvp. I’m in it for the server firsts. If i get attacked im likely to stand there and let them kill me so I can get back to questing faster. It doesn’t matter as I won’t be on a pvp server anyways.
---
Hi Kotesuya.
---
The arguments against a console version of a come down to this.  It really has already been said by others in this thread but I'll try a more extended version with some history attached.
---
Dedicated PC gamers are very opposed to the idea of making games both for consoles and PC environment as you have noticed here. Why is that?   Is this just elitism from 'the pcmasterrace'? Or do they have a point? 
---
Historically (some)  PC games were very complicated, even in the days of limited hardware and simple graphics. Not many people played these complicated strategic games , it was more something for a niche market:  the nerds.   The PC was not very good at arcade style games, but home computers and early 8 and 16 bit consoles were more mainstream, but seen as kids toys. Not many adults would admit they played Mario or Sonic.    This started to change in the nineties, when hardware became more powerful and every household would have at least 1 computer.  Around the time of the Playstation or Playstation 2  the market had matured and adults became a major target market.  Gaming had become a respectable way to spend some of your leisure time, just like going to the movies or going to a concert.   
---
As new generations of consoles became more powerful, basically little PCs they could also play more complicated games that used to be the domain of PCs.  Games like Command and Conquer and Civilization  that are PC games came out for the Playstation.  But it had its limitations  (the controls)   I challenge you to google some original reviews of these playstation versions of PC games and you will see that many reviewers acknowledge this..  Game  8/10  Graphics 9/10  fun 9/10  controls 5/10  etc ..  Is it a fun game?  yes!  Is it ideal on console?  no!  
---
Developers  knew this so  in the future they would try do something about it. why not make a game for the console first?  One reason to do this is that PC games were massively pirated and console games , although not immune to pirating, were still a better sale.   Why make a PC game that sells 100,000 copies when you can make a playstation game that sells 500,000?  an easy choice.
---
So that's how it would go for many games, Made for console, then later a PC variant might be published, or not.  And if it was , it was often horrible without extended modding.   Oblivion is a good example.
---
The PC gamer feels a little betrayed, because THEIR genre  (the stuff a PC is best in) gets butchered and dumbed down because it's more profitable to design for playstation and xbox.  
---
Now , your argument seems to be: Oh but it is *possible*  to make the same game with 2 user interfaces, one optimized for consoles  and one for PCs.  Yes that is true.  Unfortunately (almost) no design studio ever does this, as it doesn't bring enough extra sales to make up for the extra development costs.   It's not only a redesign of the UI, to *really* make use of the extra possibilities the PC gives you have to design the gameplay too.  That's too much work, so they don't do it.  Example:  Fallout conversation options.  The console design dictates that only 4 options are possible, let's call them friendly, sarcastic, unfriendly and indifferent.  Every conversation you can only choose these 4 replies (often leading to the same result, but that's another issue). This originates from 4 buttons to control the dialogue.  The PC game that could have a vastly more extended and more interesting dialogue structure gets stuck with the same, because plot lines are tied to these options. Redesigning it would basically mean redesigning the whole game story.  
---
So it's because of this that PC gamers hate console ports. They know the result is only a shadow of what it could have been, if the game would have been a pure PC born design.
---
Hi, /u/alvaromneto
---
Emerald Dream US is one of the most populated and most balanced servers there is.....
---
Madseason is the best.
---
Ah yes, hardcore RPers who don’t have jobs or shower. Activision’s golden goose.
---
Not enough info
---
This isn't retail there is no LFG you'd have to do a PUG or find some guild with an off raid time for whatever reason.
---
Yes you will have massive issues gearing
---
PvP will be next to impossible to get. In the beginning it may be easy to stay geared....But it's very unlikely NA servers are going to be pugging Nax or AQ unless some super servers emerge where all the decent players flock
---
Sure, bit ash covered is not in game at release.
---
Im rolling as an Orc shaman, but I want a death charger. So I plan on having a list from the wiki's do to **every** UC quest as I level. If we have actual 1.12 based quest rewards where you get a little extra faction rep on top of the city quest giver rep from quests I will be exalted by late 50's. Otherwise I will need to depend on AV or Cloth for the last couple thousand rep.
---
Um. Neither because you should be playing on mute with Netflix in the background?
---
Serious answer: the gun sound drives me crazy after about an hour.
---
This is a great story. I don’t remember what I was fighting when I was leveling my warrior on alliance but I bit off way more than I could chew. I think it may have been an elite mob made for 3 players. Anyway, a level 60 undead mage swoops in as I am about to die and creams it. Proceeds to protect me while I ate and arcane blasted me a path back to the main road. He just mounted up and left without emoting or anything. Weird how stuff like that happens.
---
Why Winterspring and which recipes? Genuinely asking for learning purposes, I never really made it past lvl 40 back in Vanilla
---
I totally agree! But i cant really see myself ever getting to full t1/2/3 xP im too casual for that im afraid, alltho i really want to do some raiding
---
What benefit? There is no benefit. If you delete my characters you just make it easy for me to never play again.
---
&gt; Rogue to play with my girlfriend.
---
backstab, backstab, backstab, backstab, ...
---
Yeah even in phase 3, if you just hit 60 and go directly to BGs it's going to be very unpleasant without at least dungeon gear. Even with dungeon gear, you'll get shit on a lot. I would never roll a warrior if you intend to PvP with zero raiding.
---
Medivh
---
Escaprt artist isn't instant because it's much useful....
---
You can't cleanse a hamstring. Only bop/lip it
---
You can cleanse any poison in a number of ways...
---
Well, no. But doing Deadmines is by far the more "optimal" route in terms of gear, which will make the leveling process as whole easier. I'm just worried about congestion.
---
flying is why i don't want tbc
---
The correct term would be why DID you use. its untouched since vanilla my dude.
---
Shaman totems are a big bag full of fun support tools. You can do any spec for dungeons. Raids are a bit trickier, but there is room for an enhancement outside of resto.
---
Sometimes they wouldn't know who buffed them, and would start looking around for a nearby priest to thank. Cute.
---
That's properly ambitious. Good luck!
---
It's always amazing in PvP, it's good for Raids but eventually fear ward isnt critical at some point in the raid progression. 
---
If you cant stand being a Dwarf dont roll it just for a racial is my advice.
---
I think I’m weird because I always enjoyed the gun sounds lol. I had no idea it got on people’s nerves until I watched a MadSeasonShow video yesterday where he mentioned it
---
Dude u just have to get shoulders and chest, there will be sooo many casual MCs you will be suprised. People will PUG it, people will sell runs. It will be cool, trust me my friend
---
Yeah my strat when I'm solo is to just work on the other quests nearby (wood pickups, bears, wolves, try to find solo roaming murlocs) and wait for a group or duo to clear the way and just follow in their wake.
---
Heavily biased for Alliance side.

---
Some stats from private-shenanigans.
---
The reason why you can't stack druids is exactly because of hots. The heals dont stack.
---
Human if you want good raid loot is the only option
---
Unless you join a guild full of pvpers who agree no human rogues or are willing to look past it and give you swords.
---
Wouldn't hold my breathe tho
---
So I've blade order ever since post BC but I feel like if I play alliance again it will reinvigorate the nastolgia ever more. I'd like to do PvE and try to become a more proficient PvPer.
---
[This survey](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) shows what people said they are going to play when the game launchs, and it's very similar from the stats of what people are playing right now in unofficial servers.
---
My thoughts exactly.  I'd like as close to 50/50 as possible.
---
I haven't used it, but my understanding is that it was mostly used for raid healers. You would still have spot healers on the tanks, but let everyone else just spam heal the rest of the raid perfectly. To mitigate overhealing from multiple sources, I think people would split raid healers into separate groups, and set the healbot to target only their group.
---
Again that's just conjecture, I haven't used it (because why would I, it makes healing literally brain dead), but my understanding was that used right it's pretty effective and extremely mana efficient.
---
When I had first logged in a long time ago, I had the pvp weapons equip. I remember being the hemo bitch in nax so i put on the weapons i remember using.
---
If you wanted to be in a progression raid group, meaning you’re among the first in your guild to be tackling the next level of raid content, yea, that is a trade off you have to make.
---
Back in vanilla, there were guilds and groups of guilds who would have their progression groups, then have a ‘B team’ of sorts who were doing content the main raiders already cleared. So they might be doing AQ or Naxx with their A team, for example, but have some newer and/or more casuals doing Molten Core or ZG.
---
I imagine this scenario will happen again. I had just started my career back in vanilla, and so could not stay up late for regular raids. I was a casual, and I did a lot of 5-man and 10-man level 60 dungeons. Really enjoyed it. Towards the end, I also did a bit of raiding (ZG and MC) as a casual.  So it was possible and I’m sure it will be again.
---
However, it will not be as easy to just hop into a raid group, no. That definitely is a trade off, and one that Classic fans want. I know it sounds great at first, I was initially excited when dungeon-finder was first introduced. Oh how much we didn’t know then. Dungeon-finder and raid-finder took out major social aspects of the game, helping to gut the MMO part of the game. There is little reason to talk and communicate in retail WoW. When I tried playing for a month last year, I took my warrior from Cataclysm levels (when i has quit before) to Legion-max (I forget the level numbers themselves, they meant that little), then did several dungeons, all without talking to anyone or making a single friend. I quit within a month. Just my experience anyway.
---
&gt; I suspect that Blizzard intends to add them later on rather than immediately solely for the objective of forcing players to pay a realm transfer fee
---
Give me a fucking break dude. Put the tin foil hat down, Alex.
---
Used.
---
It's fine man really, you can just bubble hearth while the groups you've let down wipe.
---
If ur a DPS whore go warlock. 
---
If u like to pvp they have very similar roles in WSG. Warlock more complex in objective PvP than just about any other class.
---
But huntard has a more meta role, some teams may go without a warlock in WSG. Very rare to see no huntards on a team
---
People who don’t like flying are gankers. 100% true.
---
You act like people didn’t camp on ground mounts lmao. Like as if they wouldn’t run you down on their 100% mount or kill you when you’re still at half health.
---
Yea not human tho
---
Human sucks for paladin
---
Release lvl 60, 40 man karazhan
---
It's annoying lol. Clearly you haven't tried returning and getting quests at Nessingway
---
Whatsup with the tbc materials in your bags though :D ?
---
&gt; In conclusion anyway. They're bang average in PvP and PvE. Downvote me all you want but this is how it is.
---
A lot of stupid shit gets posted on this sub but this is right up there with the stupidest
---
Have you seen the other top posts right now? Clever black guy and mocking spongebob, beating the STV and After-Naxx horses. This subreddit has some terrible tastes in memes and can't ever get enough of the same remarks about classic wow.
---
What class/spec is the most desired (aside from tanks)? I've been thinking of healer, but I've never done so with the vanilla healing mechanics.
---
Paladin is by far the best pure support in the game in a holistic sense.
---
What it sacrifices is the ability to do any damage, at all
---
Gear dependent and spec dependent to do any dmg at all as a pala
---
It breaks the immersion, it's okay to break the immersion the way you want it to be broken for you, not okay when developers intentionally break it for you without asking, for the sake of 'convenience'. It's a big difference.
---
No! No! NoooooOOOooOOOoooOOOOoo!
---
I would say when you play a character of either faction you start really hating the other faction regardless of where you originally stood. I was Horde only and then once leveled a Nelf. Lets just say that all of that time being for the Horde was gone. Gettting ganked and corpse camped by either faction makes you hate them with a burning passion and you start to say stuff like "only Horde would ever do something petty like this, f them".
---
You will feel strong faction identity after a while, and ofc if you never played the other faction you'll just hate them even more, because not like your faction ever does anything wrong... right?
---
Ah yes good ole Arcane dust and greater planner essence from vanilla.
---
Yeah you can do dungeons perfectly fine. But no you’re not getting into any raid. You’re a waste of a slot.
---
Jesus, it's been so long I completely forgot about leveling weapon skills. I remember in TBC there was a glitch where there was an unkillable mob in blasted lands because you needed a quest item to weaken him. So you could just wail on him until you were at max weapon skill.
---
&gt; I figure I can avoid most of the PvP aspects. 
---
You can try, but the PVP aspects will NOT ignore you !
---
Thinking people will let you alone because you don't attack them is a big mistake.
---
If you don't like PVP, never go alone outside capital cities.
---
If you like Taurens and healers, try a druid, you can heal and you can run away from PVP.
---
I will never, ever play alliance. I have no clue what that experience is like and I never will. lol
---
&gt; But because of private servers
---
Just stop right there.
---
Stop assuming P servers have any correlation to classic
---
It's little things like this that made my experience.
---
Finding healers actually isn’t too bad. I guess maybe priest for healing and mage DPS.
---
Tell me how mage beats lock in phase 1. I’m dying to know
---
Tauren racial is what ? 250 HP, a bit more once you're very well geared ...
---
That is not a game changer.
---
I'm planning the same thing. But the real issue is going to be making enough money to afford the recipes on CD early, since most are over 1g, and you're best off having 2 accounts so you don't need to drop off your main.
---
Not sure if I want to go that hard or not, but I'm taking some vacation days... Might as well pay the extra $15 for a month to go bank alt crazy.
---
Plus you have to worry about other people botting to auto-buy the recipes as soon as they come back up.
---
Sounds solid
---
Rogues are good at killing salty players every 10 minutes and collecting their tears. In mass pvp its best for them to fulfill scouting duties, giving ur guild opportunity for perfect strike/defence (roleplaying+ fits them as a class, you're not supposed to be at frontline).  At right moment, they can pop out of  the stealth and use sapper charge.
---
In PVE speedrun scenario, it doesnt matter that warrior deals more damage than rogue at the same gear lvl. U wont have enough geared warriors to replace all rogues (gl in getting 20 R14 warriors, + gearing them with raid items). 4-5 CP isnt mandatory. Get as much CP as u can and refresh slice and dice before mobs death.
---
Yes dwarves will get prio, especially on a pvp server. If you're not getting fearward on a pvp server you're an idiot. PvE server more understandable to go human
---
I know a guy on a p server who leveled N Elf then power leveled a dwarf just to stop the constant harassment hahahaha
---
Human in theory is BiS in pve because of the spirit buff. But your tanks/raid leaders will want fear ward more so no one will care.
---
Very difficult to match teh utiltiy of a buff like fearward which you can easily keep up on 10 people
---
I have the best memories of World PvP from STV. People trying to take on my priest as if they forgot about Mind Control - just hilarious times with danger around every corner
---
There isn’t any good instance farming you can do in phase 1 on a mage though, so you’ll have to wait until Dire maul comes out
---
He's going to be in for a shock when he encounters Barrens chat though :o
---
/cast [target=mouseover] for those wondering
---
Strahnbrad? Whatever the city in western plaguelands is. 
---
Check spelling and if it’s already a realm?
---
Fear Ward is perceived to be almost imba and will get you priority over a human or nelf with all other variables being equal (skill, gear, etc.) That being said, if you don't like your character, you will eventually end up viewing playtime on that character as a chore and not something you do for fun.
---
Play what you like, play it well, and eventually all of the rest will fall into place!
---
oh wow sorry for making a grammar mistake on a foreign language 
---
ummmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
BRD farming isn’t possible because of 3 mobs that can heal and net you
---
You can use Inkscape to design some pretty decent looking cards even if you're not an artist. Especially if you're "borrowing" art from the internet.
---
I did this for my game prototype
---
It’s not a grammar mistake. Lol!
---
Warlocks get to raid, especially if you’re good. Alliance for sure. Good utility, if you like Lock then I’d say go for it. Getting 40 people who consistently do their job well and show up is hard, so be that person and you’re fine.
---
Flying didn’t do shit to WPvP either lmao.
---
There was so much WPvP in the TBC outworks PvP areas, daily hubs like Ogri’la and Skettis, meeting stones, etc.
---
What actually killed WPvP was the removal of needing to even go into the world.
---
As far as I'm concerned classic players are already being milked because we are going to be paying 15 a month. The same as anyone else playing the updated wow.
---
Dungeons are great and fun as a prot paladin. Unfortunately in the content past that there is absolutely no reason for you to take a raid slot.
---
&gt; I will be exalted by late 50's
---
Nah.
---
yes start with classic. It will teach you to be a better player than starting in BFA.
---
 "Will I ever see the inside of a raid? "
---
Oh you will, but the raid that lets you in....Hahahah
---
You'll wish you hadn't
---
You reap what you sow tho. Be a shit player don't be upset when the people around you waste days of your life wiping on 13 year old content....Standards aren't there cuz the content is hard it's cuz everyone has to be a good boi and play meta so it doesn't end in some shit show with prot paladins
---
When you say support do you mean healer or buff bot?
---
Sorry if dumb question, but dead zone? What’s thay
---
I got you, brother.
---
that's why i don't want to try to date girls right now... i don't want a girl to take my precious classic wow time xD
---
*removes his Dwarven hand cannon and begins to stroke the barrel ever so slowly*
---
That sounds like a band-aid that punishes innocents though I think I mean more on where people are putting their chars. Recommendations on faction based on pop ratio when starting or moving servers. or giving people an idea of where they're putting themselves. 
---
But even this goes both ways many might be like "ooo barthilas is all horde I'm gonna join that cause I want more interactions with fellow horde" then each server just becomes a horde or alliance server just like retail was
---
Instantly erect.
---
How much playtesting have you done? Because things that seem awesome on paper aren't always so balanced in reality.
---
They ahve a huge correlation
---
We've been playing the same patch for 13 years and have a lot of data on it
---
I know peole on the outside don't understand these servers...But we do. Trust me there is endless bitching about the inaccuracies.
---
From the perspective of what your UI should look like and what addons you would need in a no changes classic? yes yes i do
---
&gt; Will dwarfs get first prio to a raid spot in (any) raid because of the fear ward?
---
Yes, because you also need fear ward for trash. Fear ward is needed in all raids. When I say "needed" I am fully aware that in theory it's possible to clear without fear ward. In general people don't want to just barely cleary content, they want reasonably smooth and timely run and not having any fear ward is a quick way to ruin that.
---
Female dwarves have amazing casting animation.
---
Imagine being so beta that you can't network while getting educated.
---
And it only gets worse for pallys later
---
I figure I can /wave /truce /sit, and then I'll just accept my fate. I can probably stay ahead of the level curve so that the zones aren't so populated.
---
I figure it'll be like vanilla launch when the servers would crash/lag and I would randomly die. The enemy players are just helping to recreate that experience.
---
Not what I was commenting on but ok.
---
Totally agree. Priest is pretty fun casual too at 60. Not hard to gear up for heals, pick up some off-spec items. Go shadow once in a while for PvP. Farm by doing orb runs.
---
Dunno why you were downvoted. It's 22.
---
yeah I thought he was talking about ivory raptor XD i need to learn how to read better
---
Yeah, i assumed the ivory. my bad
---
A realm transfer in any capacity, free or payed, for a new server is the worst idea ever and I don't even think blizzard are dumb/greedy enough to do that.
---
When any company needs to add more realms/servers do to overpopulation, then server transfer shouldn't be opened up for months or else it creates a pay to win element(if it's payed transfers). Many level cap players would ruin the in-game economy by trying to corner the market. 
---
The whole concept is transferring capped characters to a fresh server would be a disaster, and I don't think Blizzard would ever consider it.
---
I'd rather leave the slot vacant, it's better for morale.
---
Could you PM me the name of said server? Plzz
---
This. The only healer class that sucks to level is paladin and you do that as ret. shaman kinda blows too. Druid levels easily, priest too if you do it correctly.
---
Stormstrike, Nightfall (Indirectly)
---
Both
---
You are a moron.  
---
I hope you like living in dungeon.  
---
Eventually, just to be on a youtube video when MC is on super farm.  
---
Of course people have attempted, but they failed just like you will. It just doesnt work, you dont have a taunt and you will have 0 mana.
---

---
You can run certain animations in the dressing room. Look for Spellcastdirect and Spellcastomni.
---
The Dwarf model has a low quality, even for Vanilla standards, but the actual casting animations are really smooth in my opinion.
---
As for Fear Ward: Your guild won't bother, but pugs might. And the content that will be pugged has two prominent bosses that fear: Onyxia and Magmadar. You don't need FW for either, but it's likely that raid leaders would like to minimize the room for error through a bullet-proof Fear Ward.
---
Go Human for weaponskill or Troll for the racial ability berserking (I think that is the name, 3m cooldown increases DPS). The racials for both of these races increase DPS which increases threat generation as well if you tanking.
---
But you can win with any race so pick whats most enjoyable!
---
I mean, at least TBC and I assume most of the content is still present in retail? Probably would be very cost effective for them to open a TBC server down the road, but I just want classic now, don't really care about what comes after.
---
This is my list : https://i.imgur.com/DTm9vpT.png
---
Yea, i'm a bit tough with whatever I critisize in general. Stratholme (and Deadmines a bit below) being my true love.
---
Well with game running on legion engine I hope botting will be mitigated somewhat. I'm just going to check every time I want to get a drink or take a break, do it casually. So if there are like 15 other people there I'll just give up and forget about it.
---
If you don't know the full gif or didn't see the show, I'm very sad for you.

But for who knows the full gif, this is just fucking brilliant.

Anal [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
See even that isn't necessarily the most useful, it only shows the prerequisite relationship of the prior quest, not the entire chain, which is what I need. Although at this point this request on here is relatively useless since I made my own sheet to my purposes. Take a look
---
It's either that or Druid (for those sweet heals), but since I'm already playing a Shaman elsewhere, I don't want to level two characters that will both ultimately end up healing.
---
Wait for her next expansion.
---
Which region?
---
&gt;that's why they make you rep and achievement grind for flying in the new zones in recent expansions.
---
I argue that blizz do the pathfinder loop jumping contest just to get you logging back doing meaningless content over and over.
---
Get those kids farming consumes, stat!
---
Notable vanilla guilds:
---
* Nihilum
---
* Conquest
---
* Ascent
---
* Fury
---
* Retribution
---
* Risen
---
Personally I want to play on this one, though:
---
* Death and Taxes
---
Haha, yeah
---
Another great suggestion, to be read before Lord of the Clans. Those two should be enough to make anyone enjoy the idea of going horde.
---
Also don't read war of the ancients. I have always gravitated towards night elves after I read it.
---
Roguecraft? Hehe
---
I remember levelling a paladin as extremely slow and boring- this was in Wrath though. Totem management puts me off Shaman although I’ve read they are massively in demand for raiding so easy to get a raid spot. Do you have a firm preference on melee versus caster for levelling? Do you care about doing any PVP?
---
This is amazing! I genuinely laughed out loud
---
&gt; If someone has feral as their main spec then they should need on whatever feral gear they want no matter what spec they're in at the time.
---
Then they should look for group as a DPS, not a healer.
---
Prepare to be disappointed my friend.
---
Youthinkyoudo
---
Butyoudont
---
Nelf warrior is probably the class that gets the most out of wisp form though.
---
Seriously you're too nice for a PVP server, they will eat you alive.
---
If you still decide to do it, at least play a druid you will have the best toolkit to evade PVP.
---
Thank you &lt;33
---
2h fury is a thing on horde. Early on its competitive with arcanite reaper and very competitive with BRE.
---
If chromie is a pvp server would anyone play on any other server though lol
---
People tend to exaggerate the effects of PvP servers.  It does NOT mean you have to constantly PvP, a lot of people just like that there's the ability to do so.  Some zones are far more active (STV), but even so you can generally avoid PvP if you so choose. Likewise as Vanilla is very rock paper scissors for PvP, your class and/or gear level will dictate whether or not people will attack you much of the time.
---
thanks that's pretty awesome
---
Garbage, reroll.
---
That should get rid of the competition....
---
Totally agree. I level capped all 3 of those in Vanilla/BC. This time around I am for sure doing another undead warlock.
---
Didn’t someone just post evidence sit macros won’t work in classic?
---
I dont think it comes down to viable. Nobody plays WoW to be viable. You've gotta enjoy the Character you play. 
---
My main back in Vanilla was a hunter, I raided up to the first few bosses in Naxx, and got to level 12 (marshal). Loved it.  But my Alt, was a Resto shammy, which by the time tBC came round, I was playing a lot more, and having a lot more fun. I raided in tBC with the shammy and found it more fun than a hunter. 
---
So this time I am re-rolling a shammy and leveling as ele &amp; going full resto round around early 50's for instance leveling, doing my attunements and getting the scholo / UBRS key etc.
---
Apparently once might be enough to be hooked. This is definitively something I wouldn't try.
---
Do yourself a favor and listen to it, friend.
---
I feel like im taking crazy pills for knowing im specifically going to AVOID STV till im high level. Like I totally get ‘but the memories, and you have to’ but do you really? I mean, STV is legit goinf to add hours to players /played just to get to 60. Id rather avoid the fights in STV till I outmatch the gankers
---
Mother
---
Thats a nice idea.
---
I'm not going to play another faction, but I will pick my server depending on faction balance.
---
I'm not particularly excited that I have to pay 15 dollars per month for a sub to BFA and Classic when I have no interest in playing BFA.  I don't think it should be free, but I would likely be willing to stay subbed for longer if I could sub to just Classic at a discounted price @ like $5 or $7.50.
---
It's a ERP thing you wouldn't understand :o
---
i guess if you don't know any better it's "okay" but i was messing around with it on a PTR and, having played prot paladin in tbc, it's simply a sad experience not worth the effort
---
This is actually a pretty cool idea.
---
Yeah but I thought people will decline you from the group if you're not the correct spec?
---
I was under the impression that Rogues were more gear dependent than some classes after the 1.12 nerfs?
---
Yep. The most unusual FW:Fort I ever cast was on some anonymous fellow alliance player who was at the time flying past on a Gryphon taxi. I wonder if he/she noticed it when they arrived at their destination.
---
Pvp server is fun but can be frustrating. Dying over and over means go do something else til that person leaves.
---
I'm aware. But as long as they dont force us into TBC I'm ok.
---
If you're a competent gamer then you'll adapt and learn to hold your own. Especially as one of those two classes. You'll have some fights. I'm confident that 90% of the people who say that PvP servers are pure chaos are PvE-centric players who are spreading word of mouth or who peaced out of a PvP server early with hatred in their hearts. 
---
 So if you're not a shit player and if you've got the temperament to handle a bit of danger then you'll have a good time. Druid would also afford you the opportunity to team up with other players as a hybrid healer and see how much damage you can do as a duo / trio / foursome.
---
&gt; That sounds like a band-aid that punishes innocents though
---
Not really sure I follow you.
---
&gt; But even this goes both ways many might be like "ooo barthilas is all horde I'm gonna join that cause I want more interactions with fellow horde" then each server just becomes a horde or alliance server just like retail was
---
So then if you *knowingly* choose that server, then you are *knowingly* accepting the negatives that come with the overpopulated side, such as longer bg queues times. While the lesser faction still gets nailed, with nothing they can do about it.
---
The solution I gave, which might not be the best, helps both sides at the root of the issue, as opposed to crbgs, which really only helps out the dominant faction. Hopefully blizz has been thinking about this problem and has a solution or remedy.
---
Us redditors could get together and have a few designated servers to play on and attempt to match the factions as close to 50/50 as possible, though.
---
You've got an opportunity to learn from a mistake made by other people.
---
Yet you're choosing to make that same mistake anyway...
---
Perhaps I should remove the 'untouched' I switched mains in tbc, but of course played the expansion before losing access to this particular account. I have since played the wrath, wod, legion and bfa expansions but never really lasted more then the first raid tier. You will notice I also have the horde wow movie boa items in the bag. Stupid movie convinced me to play and at the time I was horde so transferred. But then realised nostalgia to strong leave him alone.
---
1. give Blizzard 15 bucks. (a month)
---
2. you can now play Classic WoW.
---
3. you can also play "not Classic" WoW if you want, up to the Legion expansion.
---
4. if you want to play the newest expansion Battle for Azeroth you have to pay more.
---
No! Nooooooo!
---
Says it can’t be viewed.  I wanna watch!
---
Except you have BC materials so it's not untouched at all. Why lie?
---
pp very hard
---
Made me lol
---
Ibliss MH?
---
8/8 is bis because of the set bonus.
---
Pick one:
---
1) Protection Tank
---
2) Paladin
---
Or, alternatively, you could just go Ret.
---
Planning on being a Gnome Warlock with mining and engineering, however after that post yesterday avoit the guys large group all going horde made me second guess my choice. 
---
I LOVE all the alliance cities. The beautiful areas of SW and the coziness if IF. I love the night elf mounts and was planning on rep farming to get one on my gnome. 
---
But now im not so sure. Im planning on going PVP server bevause that’s ultimately where the more fun is. And I know horde is kore pvp centered. 
---
Thing is im not in love with how Orcs and undead slouch, and those are my only options. 
---
I sadly am also pretty solo, ive never made real lasting relationships in the game so im not 100% sure about what my future holds woth raids and everything in classic. Therefore im worried ill never raid as horde (or alliance) and that my choice to go horde will be for naught. 
---
Im in a pickle, and woth the time commitment classic takes, I dont want to ‘waste time’ leveling one sode only to wish I went the other.
---
Nope, not crazy at all. I started on PvP after coming from being a total EQ pve type player and was hooked. The one character I rolled on a PvE server I couldn't stick with past 30. Seeing the other faction just sitting there and being unable to interact with them is just the most immersion breaking thing in the world. Even when you're not into world PvP, the ever present threat just deepens the whole playing experience. And since there's a constant threat of being ranked, people are more likely to group up to complete quests even if it's technically sub-optimal exp/hour simply to avoid being ganked. Then there's those times where some amazing world pvp breaks out and you end up doing that all day instead of whatever random grindy quest you were working on.
---
Yes there's downsides too. There will be days where you simply can't do what you want because some aspy 13 yr old decided he's gonna camp you all day, but imo those occasions are worth it for the overall experience. 
---
And like you say, since you're not sure if raiding can really be your end-game goal, there's always the possibility you might end up enjoying Wpvp, which is great since it can be done any time of day for any length of play session.
---
Not even sure what you’re trying to say with that last part but okay. 
---
Have fun!
---
Yeah I think what this really needs is a weapon progression while leveling, because acquiring the right weapons might be one of the difficulties of this spec. Nothing wrong with switching between 2h and DW though, depending on what you can get your hands on
---
Fourth by now, since third is the mace?
---
Unfortunately you won't get battlegrounds at the start so you get to fight against twinks instead.
---
Not more, they can still kill people naked. But before most of the nerfs until 1.12 made it harder to kill people naked.
---
^This.  pserv that rhymes with dwarfnail
---
Getting the same error!! :(
---
Are you asking for what the "real" answer will be in the game we dont have access to so can't answer? I can guarantee that private servers TRIED to get it right and werent just throwing new stats interactions for the heck of it. If they got it wrong, than they did, if they didn't, they didn't. No one but a blizz dev. currently working on the game can give you a 100% true answer =/
---
You might think they "should", but in my experience main specs have priority over offspecs on loot in dungeons, not the current spec people are playing.
---
Thank u
---
Sorry for bad title. Yes I had tbc, no I didnt play the rogue.. That I can remember.
---
Thanks
---
Lord A-Aron
---
Quality roast all around
---
The level range is 31-45. You can still get ganked by someone who's 7 levels higher with no chance of winning. In other zones the difference is not that drastic.
---
Also you spend forever in STV and the horde and alliance do similar quests.
---
i am saying, count up 16 essential debuffs, that will take up all 16  debuffslots when only DM and MC is out aka phase 2.  
---
Since you say there is no chance to use 1 for Mortal Strike, you must have filled the other 15.
---
Ahhh I'm following your thought now, that they are labelling the reason for the queue or warning the queues before choosing a realm...I though you meant just restrict them from getting in to make world content balanced. Nobody would know why or what their initial decision entailed if it wasn't presented. They have never listed faction ratios in any form and I'd be surprised if they started
---
Im kinda surprised by some of those results
---
Agreed. It's realllly not that bad. I feel like most people that complain about being camped were probably huge assholes that were constantly attacking reds no matter the circumstances. PvP really won't significantly slow your leveling down, unless you're reallllllly getting farmed and even then it might make like an hour or two difference in total.
---
You can wave and be friendly to the opposing faction, or show you mean no harm by helping them kill a mob or something, and people will literally let others know that you're not hostile. At least that was the case on pretty much every pvp server I've been on. I always ran into these kinds of people.
---
That being said, just like /u/kitelobster said, certain areas are going to be hot zones, like STV/Tanaris (pirate cove)/Shimmering Flats, because those are some of the first places that the masses get to really encounter the opposing faction. So there is a lot of "sizing up" going on.
---
Haha okey, I'll just leave it at that since you have 0 clue about anything lol
---
Melee attacks require you to be within 5 yards of the target. Ranged attacks (bows, guns) require you to be atleast 8 yards away from the target. That means you cant damage anything that falls in the "deadzone" between 5 and 8 yards. Mostly comes into play in pvp.
---
Have some faith, they are recreating classic after all, and a huge amount of the changes made to WoW over the years were based on player ‘wants’ and feedback.

I've seen mages farm Stratholme but I'm not sure if it's possible with phase 1 gear. The dude I saw had BWL gear but I don't actually know.
---
I know the BGs won't be at the start, but at my pace they'll probably be put in right around the time I'm in my 50s or maybe even 60.  I'm fine with the wait.   
---
I've played on the private servers off and on for the past three years, and I'm pretty much over the "omg amazing world pvp is so awesome and stuff" phase.  I'm not going to be one of the super fast levelers, which means I'll be getting ganked left and right by bored level 60s if I play on a pvp server, and it's just not the playstyle I'm looking for.  I love WoW battlegrounds for my pvp, because it's more or less evenly matched, while world pvp is almost never evenly matched.
---
My favorite are sunken temple cause it is one of the few dragon heavy dungeons, ubrs because having the key always made me feel needed and special and scholomance for the flasks.
---
Theres a nice hybrid spec where you go far enough into the healing talents to effectively heal then go down the prot tree. Havent tried it myself but its like a paladin hotw druid spec. You'll be capable of healing raids and tanking everything up to 10 mans is what it says. Maybe look into that. If the prot dream is just to tank 40 mans i dont really see it happening. You simply cant outthreat the raid without horribly debilitating their ability to dps. You're not a moron if you want to play somethin do it, but you're unlikely to get groups. Wotlk took steps to make every spec more usable with new abilities and better itemization. In vanilla classes were closer to dungeons and dragons where the class defined you instead of the spec defining you. Paladins were imagined as healers as evident from the tierset set effects. Later expacs started giving different versions of the gear so each spec had something to shoot for. Originally though dont consider classes based on spec consider them as the class. Warriors tank and very effectively tank in any spec if done right because they were imagined that way. Talents are minor nudges not magical character changing buttons.

Do we have any evidence that there will not be RP-PVP realms?
---
Exactly! Besides if you start at launch it isnt exactly like some lvl 60 will roll up in your startingzone and gank you. You'll most likely not run into any pvp til like lvl15+ and by then you sort of have an idea what to do in PvP as youll be killing so many mobs just to get to that stage.
---
Most people that might bother you are around the same level as you and if they do kill you on sight, chances are they killed someone else of your faction aswell. Give it a couple min and a horde of members seeking revenge/to complete their quest will form around you and you charge in there together and try to regain control! It's fun!
---
Yes. There are specific debuffs for the 16. Mortal strike is not one of them. Hence why it isn’t viable. Ever. I’ve never seen a single MS warrior in raiding throughout all of vanilla or any private servers and all of those debuffs are used on other things.
---
I’m not even sure what you’re arguing. That maybe a guild will let someone raid as MS War?  I mean I guess but very unlikely.
---
I am very envious of you if it does launch early summer. Being a high schooler on summer break burning into vanilla is an extremely special experience.
---
SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP SNIP
---
Oh how the turn tables...
---
Im not crazy, she's crazy!
---
you'll be fine unless you are playing a rogue. Everybody knows rogues like to gank so if you see one leveling its a must kill on site, you know... to prevent future ganks....
---

I saw you on the Countdowntoclassic Drunk stream! 
---
What's your take on closed beta announcement possibly this Friday and invites going out on Monday??
---
IIRC, the 8 set effectively makes ur healing wave function like chain heal. But its becomes better then chain heal because it scales better with +healing and puts up the bonus healing talent shamans have.
---
But its only viable if your remaining slots make up enough +healing and/or Mp5 to actually make it work.

Extend the lifespan of character progression without raising the level cap by making the raids harder
---
Adding 5 man dungeons with raid like mechanics could also be interesting (Destiny franchise has some very fun 6man ‘raids’)
---
Thanks for the info my dude. I'll look into that hybrid heals/prot.
---
This is very helpful! I’ll definitely check it out.

Sounds like you haven't played on either server.

Locks can farm princess faster than mages and world farming is contested so locks beat mages
---
Ragefire not an S? Thats an amazing starter-dungeon. Love that zone.
---
There are a few guilds that will raid around lunch on the weekends which works fine for EU players.
---
Clear and concise. Thanks!

Jesus you're miserable
---
I swear I've seen this exact same meme format used like 10 times here in the past few weeks. We get it guys. Do something more original
---
Holy shit this. You're hearing different opinions because people have different opinions. Stop looking for someone to tell you what to do and instead *form your own opinions.*
---
I was in the same boat as Zumbert and Diredevil1 has it right I believe.  Mages have a smoother leveling experience and better at gold farming.  Plus portals...  Super convenient and can also make some gold off of them.  Less gear dependent than rogues as well.  Start with a mage for easier gold and leveling, then you can pump that extra gold into gear when you level your rogue to make it less painful :)
---
Not much to be honest. I had to predict how people might build their characters and how their abilities might co-operate with each other. I spent a few weeks trying to figure out what the resource costs should be, how much damage/heal should they provide, what would the best cooldowns be for specific abilities etc. I won't lie if I say that I spent about a month or two planning everything. I think it all worked though, because surprisingly our first game worked perfectly and none of the abilities was in need of nerf/buff (players team was composed of Holy Priest, Beast Mastery Hunter and Fury Warrior).  
---
I even came up with some pretty unique and overpowered abilities combos that are quite hard and resource consuming to perform. Of course they need the right team composition, good co-operation, and some luck. Thanks to that an Elemental Shaman might give a Marksmanship Hunter a chance to deal 6x raw damage with his Aimed Shot. If the Hunter will be lucky with his dice roll, he might even deal critical hit that will triple that damage. That gives 18x raw damage!   
---
Never happened though. And I doubt it will happen anytime soon.
---
Questie won't work in Classic so it's pretty pointless to download it.
---
My guild was one of the ones that migrated there back in the day. Good times.
---
Hardcore raids will at least. Healing Shamans are always in demand though.

I feel like I’m in the same boat, I’m really looking forward to it. Just need a release date so I can organise my two weeks PTO.
---
I really want to be a tank. I loved it in wotlk but rogue is my comfort zone.  I played rogue in vanilla and on private servers.    I watch warrior videos and read about them all the time.  I just feel like somehow I wont be good or I'll regret it in some way.  I dont want to be a dps warrior.
---
I hated ST. I'm so surprised to see it on a lot of people's lists. I was a youngin but still managed max level. My memories of ST are running around lost while being murdered by dragon's.
---
I played wow on pvp server first because of friends. For years I thought every server had world pvp the same way because its WORLD of WARcraft. Many years later I rolled onto a pve server and it just felt weaker. There is no narrative of the drums of war if I cant be a racist kill on sight fuck. Sometimes you help the other faction and cant communicate, on a pvp server that is special. On a pve server its pointless. It sounds spooky that you'll be killed all the time. Is it possible? Sure. But the world is big enough that realistically its just a motivator to not be weak or stay around bad places too long.
---
I think the base addon is called HealComm, but I'm not sure. I just use Luna Unitframes which is an addon developed by the private server players. It'll be interesting to see which addons will work when Classic comes out. Part of me wants none of them to work so we get a bit of the "pure" vanilla feel hehe.
---
\+heal is calculated by dividing the cast time by 3.5 and multiplying with your +heal. So Greater Heal rank 5 will heal on average 2080, if you have 500 +heal you can add 3/3.5\*500 = 429 so it'll heal on average 2509. Not such a big increase but look at your normal Heal spell. It heals on average 759 and with 500 +heal it increases by 429 to 1188 which is a much bigger increase. Comparing the mana costs of these as well; Greater Heal V costs 710 and Heal IV costs 305. If you then downrank those spells they become even more mana efficient so you can heal more. This is only true when you have lots of +heal though. Compare Heal ranks (disregarding rank 1 because spells below a certain level scales differently);
---
Rank 2: 461/205mana = 2.25 hpm
---
Rank 3: 605/255mana = 2.37 hpm
---
Rank 4: 759/305mana = 2.49 hpm
---
As you can see, the higher ranked spells are more mana efficient. This is generally the rule when you don't have a lot of +healing gear, so keep this in mind while healing low-level dungeons, always use the max rank unless you start overhealing.
---
Now with 500 +healing;
---
Rank 2: 890/205mana = 4.34 hpm
---
Rank 3: 1317/255mana = 4.05 hpm
---
Rank 4: 1188/305mana = 3.90 hpm
---
Now the efficiency decreases with higher ranks and this shows the power of downranking. Greater Heal and Renew has similar values. 
---
There are addons like Theorycraft that show you all this information in the tooltip so you can quickly get a grasp of what spells are efficient and so on. Sometimes you'll have to sacrifice efficiency for higher throughput and sometimes you need fast heals which means Flash Heal and it's really inefficient. One of the reasons why priests hate the paladins, they just snipe all our heals with their super efficient Flash of Light.
---
Lastly I didn't factor talents into the numbers so don't quote me on them, but the idea is the same.
---
DM and SM are totally different tho. Unless you mean breaking apart the four dungeons in SM
---
Lots of great game mechanics in this! Awesome work

I hope blizzard goes back to their 2004 ToS on chatting or i'm gonna have to remove my enter key

&gt;no\_ragrats
---
definitely..
---
When i was like 12 i urged and begged my mom to let me buy wow and a subscription. This was back when my mom though anything on the internet was a scam so i had to do 10x the chores and shit in order to convince her. 
---
I couldn't log in for the first 6 months, servers were constantly crashing. Since i was a kid i could only play peak times which meant that there was always a 3-6 hour queue to get in, which was more than my allowed time in front of the computer. Remember i got to lvl 23 in the first 6 months. Although you did get free play-time from Blizzard for the trouble. 
---
I may be over exaggerating and remembering wrong because i was an impatient kid back then, but it seriously sucked. You can go back and look at the old forum posts about people saying they would sue and stuff. Yet, this time there is gonna be 10x more players starting out in the same zones. This time it will be instantly instead of the gradual increase that classic release had, they need sharding.
---
hahaha well done mate really cracked me up!
---
Priest has the best hps overall. Works everywhere and all the time. Has Stam, spirit buff and power word shield. You can buff casters if discipline. Low actual utility in raids unless you go disc, then you turn into a mediocre healer but you boost caster dps. Can remove diseases and magic effects. Offensive dispel is great, except on Lucifron. Objectively the best healing class allround. 
---
Druid can have the best hps when being the single druid in a raid. You will get geared really fast in a raid guild because there will be so few druids. Faerie fire is really good. Mark of the wild! Druid is the only class with more than one viable heal spec (discipline is not a good heal spec, but an ok support spec). If resto/balance, you can even outsnipe paladins! Combat rez every 15 mins ONLY. 
---
Can offtank need be. Can remove curse and poison. 
---
If you're passionate about it, you will own as a druid healer in any environment. You are a beast (literally) in pvp. Everyone loves a druid, but nobody prefers one. 
---
Paladin is the alliance response to shamans. You can bubble warlocks if they overaggro. Each blessing is a separate plus! You will be loved by all except other heal classes in a raid environment because you 420 quickscope aimbot with flash of light. You can sacrifice yourself to save rogues with world buffs. Can remove everything but curses. As a paladin, you will always be needed/wanted in any environment, as a healer and nothing else. Said to be the easiest healer to play. Can be considered the best pvp healer. 
---
Shaman is the horde version of a paladin. You have totems, specifically WINDFURY!!! You want a shaman in every raid group, or every group in a raid wants a shaman rather. Good healer, can chain heal if need be. Can purge enemy buffs, just like priests! Strong utility in both pve and pvp. Can return from the dead. You are a force to be reckoned with.
---
I had fun writing this.
---
Couldn't possibly be more accurate
---
Underrated comment right here
---
I'd say just play your gnome since it sounds like that's what you want to play. You can always find a pop centered guild.
---
BRD should be doable. Depends where the mobs that have nets are located.
---
Ima play spell power tankadin so i dont think i can roast u
---
You're crazy if you DON'T. The design of this game stems around faction encounters. Without it, multiple layers of potential are removed imo.
---
What does retail not have nelf boobs?
---
Without ZG or DM out, Hunter/Lock should be the fastest farmers by far unless you count Devilsaur camping and Black Lotus farming.
---
Since i read this post i’ve been thinking about it so much it’s silly. It’s probably the thing i’m most excited about aswell, stupid as it might sound. It’s also the reason i will probably level a druid over warlock. 
---
As far as alliance, i’ll buff them with moonfire ;)
---
is this dark edge of insanity in your main bag?
---
Gives source “your source isn’t valid” go cry
---
NE Priest it’s the Chad combo
---
It would be nice if /trade could actually be used for trade. If this addon fixes that I'm all for it.
---
Text or GUI for finding your group is irrelevant, the social aspect comes in to play once you've joined the group.
---
Yeah, I'm absolutely puzzled by this madman's taste aswell.
---
Ragefire not even in A? It's one of the best starter Dungeons in the game, at least for me.
---
Thing is, mages can also aoe farm the dogs in DM North. Because all Dire Maul dungeons are technically the same instance you can avoid hitting the reset cap by alternating between the two.
---
Mobs above the arena should work no?
---
Yeah, some people! Jeez! 
---
*returns to my elemental shaman build planner*
---
I think I probably am a fairly shit player to be fair. I have acquired a gaming mouse and am learning to move with that instead of the arrow keys so hopefully that will help 😂😂😂 On the plus side I definitely do have the temperament to handle a bit of danger.
---
So what you're saying is, you're really bad at picking your fights.
---
Dwarf Rogue best Rogue
---
How do people typically run Blackrock Depths?  Split it into parts or...?
---
That the class design in pvp pretty much, lots of frontload and insanely good abilities - but requires some downtime to recharge.
---
Nothing wrong with that, if u want sustain make something else.
---
Are you thinking Tribute run for Warlock?
---
What’s the other thing?
---
I physically cannot play Alliance because I don't agree with a lot of the awful shit they do. In Classics current politics the humans massacred peaceful Frosaken diplomats, and invaded the ancestral homelands of the Tauren to mine (for profits, which is different than using trees to build homes and necessary fire). Honestly the Alliance is just trying to kill as many members of the Horde as possible while the Horde are trying to protect themselves and establish a home. The only members of the Alliance I really respect are Jaina Proudmore (I need to stress in VANILLA) and her humans, The Wildhammer and Bronzebeard clans, and anyone willing to put the matter of race aside for neutral forces like the Argent Dawn and Cenarion Circle.
---
Jesus christ lol 
---
I'm a paladin player idc u can do what u want
---
These dirty ret paladins are not getting their hands on my pvp plate tho
---
No. Im saying that items that are verygood for healer and elemental (Like lok'amir) should always be given to healer. Because shaman who is willing to spec as healer to perform best as he can for the raid should be rewarded. Ofcourse pure dps items, like gear with only naturespell damage should go to elemental shaman. 
---
In case where healer and hybrid dps wants the same item, there always should be auto priority for healer. Items is also more worth more on healer or pure dps than it would be on hybrid. 
---
Im sure that 2/3 of all the hybrids would rather dps than heal, if it would be viable. And now you think that "If they would rather dps, why not roll mage or rogue?" Its not the same. Different class fantasy etc etc.
---
why bc he like the elf boops?
---
All four healers are desired in raids. All 4 healers, when played by good players, are extremely powerful. 
---
Play the one you like the aesthetic of. Regardless of class, 90% of your raid combat time is spent cancel casting.
---
Faith for greedy management? Why should I pay 13€ for a good game (classic) and a game no one cares about? (retail wow BFA). If only they would put the solo price of a 14 yo game at 5 bucks, then by all means. But this is just greed to compensate the BFA fiasco, which is just their fault tbh. 
---
How hard is it to get the hands on wow 1.12 and just apply some performance and security patches? (to support metal, Dx10, 11 and 12 or Vulkan) and nothing more? (maybe increased server capacity without crashing the servers in high populated zones). 
---
We are already getting quality of life improvements no one asked for and the game is already on employee beta testing... So what am I supposed to have faith on exactly?  You think Blizzard / Activision are gonna turn into the good guys just because they will release classic? They are a company, they are supposed to make money. This ain't charity lad.
---
That’s one of the reason’s I’m considering it. Reading stuff on here has made me feel like maybe I’ve been missing out on something.
---
I only thought negative unsupportive things. I don't want to say them but I want you to know that. Good luck.
---
Equating TBC to retail because both have flying is ridiculous.
---
Even WOTLK is vastly different from retail.
---
We got classic, finally! Don't see any reason why people aren't allowed to play their favorite version of the game as well.
---
You say that like you can't be provoked into bubbling early and subsequently killed.
---
EXACTLY
---
 Convince me that in high level PvP it's not crazy to go for NE hunter? I mean stun resist is nuts, stoneforn says a big F-U to rogues, even cows get that extra interrupt/stun that can save your life! And what do these awesomely jumping creatures with sick bow animations and 100% fitting rank 10 pvp armor and epic flowery bow get? 9 AGI and 1% dodge and shadowmeld that doesn't even allow you to dodge spells, just meme camp in BG's?
---
Insert Change my mind meme
---
Where would you recommend in phase 1?
---
That hardly qualifies as a conspiracy. Things like this are even common business practices, especially for larger companies like Blizzard.
---
I’m also worried. I’m considering trying out a PvP server so faction balance seems like it will be a big thing. I think in retail PVP servers tend to be more horde than alliance but no idea if that will be the case in classic.
---
Vanilla taught me that anything is possible. You can find more skill in PvP that you didn't think you had by being forced to be on guard all the time. There could always be a rogue hiding. 
---
I think you'll have fun.
---
Great for getting those surprise charges off too.
---
I'm wondering if sharding will be in Westfall/Barrens/Loch Modan/ Darkshore/Silverpine. It would make sense for the first week or so I'd say.

If you want some real big brain plays rebind your wasd to esdf, aquire 4 extra buttons, combined with shift and alt... You just gained an entire action bar of super efficient keybinds for free. 
---
Also unbind camera zoom from your mouse wheel and gain 6 of the easiest and comfiest imagine keybinds to use.
---
“My prot Paladin has full epics, finally I think we can attempt BRD” 
---
Prot paladins are a broken class. You don’t have a taunt, and what mana you do have is subject to mana burns, you’re subject to silences, and even without mana burn your mana doesn’t last for an entire fight. 
---
Just play a prot warrior—don’t be a goof ball.
---
It wasn't completely braindead. You had only one button to press, yes, but sometimes you also had to press the decursive button AND you also had to click "Yes" for the ready check every once in a while.
---
Blizzard started the FIRE!
---
There's two major downsides to being a dedicated tank. 
---
First, you're garbage in organized pvp. WotLK really nailed the pvp viability of warrior prot spec, vanilla not so much. I'd kill for Warbringer as a deep prot talent.
---
Second, unless you're willing to start your own guild or be a very active member of the officers of a guild, you won't be starting out as a raid tank, but will have to get into a guild via dps then maybe get moved to tank as membership fluctuates. 
---
However if you're just looking to have a good time 1-60 and casual pvp, tanking is tons of fun. I had one war late vanilla who basically just messed around and would do PuG ZG and AQ20 raids. You can still get a decent variety of gear and have fun this way.
---
My guess is that Blizzard is going to be very smart about servers at launch (though they may underestimate how many people are excited about Classic).
---
All this is to say that if you pick a server at launch... it SHOULD have a high population, at least for a while. Once the server announcement is made, pay attention here to get a sense of where folks plan on going.
---
You need to not read the horde version of your post....
---
But apparently paladins are awesome. Plus you can be an elf. Or a gnome with pink pigtails. Far prettier than a big ugly orc.
---
Shaman or warlock? I really like to pvp and raid. Ele shaman seems way more fun due to the crits. I’m fine with healing in PvE but will farming gold be a pain? Shaman would be my first choice but respec costs worry me. If it’s a huge pain to switch back and forth I think I’d rather go warlock. Warlocks seem like they will have more gear competition and itl be harder to find groups. Plus soul shard management. Ahhh decisions decisions.
---
Man i dont know whats going on :( every video i upload people have issues viewing them. I switched my upload format to an optimal one etc. I have no idea why it keeps doing this :(
---
Please do not be in Elwynn at 14
---
Open world pvp was actually legit in vanilla as well. Yes you will be killed, griefed, and camped at times, but you get to do that too!
---
Go for it, shoes are overrated.
---
Heh no, grand Marshall 1h axe. I can't remember the exact details but I believe the pvp rank system changed just before tbc. Our raiding guild ended up just farming honor and buying weapons and armour before the expansion.
---
Dont listen to the neckbeards. Play what you want. Out of like 60 bosses only like 12 of em fear ward is used in. There also wont be enough priests that you can just stroll up to stormwind and pick out your favorite like a petstore. That said if your goals are hardcore like speedrunning raids or server firsts, take any advantage you can get. Humans are really nice priests too though.
---
Thankyou my friend. Got so much more content on the way stay tuned !

Ha, you'll probably never die with a pocket healer.

THe difference between 100 and say 600 is big.

But even 100 is basically an unplayable slog.

"This guy's videos" is still not a source mate. You need to actually point to something, a video, timecode, quote, something, anything. It's called burden of proof. Don't drop out of school, they'll teach you these things when you get to the big boy years.

Thank for for addressing RPPvP.  It’s a very important issue for some of us.
---
Great looking zones, Ironforge and Stormwind are top tier capital cities, DWARVES, you can have paladins to buff you.
---
highest armor, lay on hands. only way to remove mortal strike without consumes
---
Blessing of sacrifice
---
Shamans are better as a hybrid obviously, and raping plebs.
---
But if you're actually pressured and you need support. Paladin is VASTLY superior.
---
Wanna shut down a shaman? Drink greater nature resist potions and then cc him after killing his tremor/grounding totems. And trash buffs go up as skill goes up. So purges usefulness drops drastically. 
---
Totem uptime goes down as skill goes up.
---
Paladin usefulness as skill goes up. There are no obvious counterplays beyond CSing them. Shaman gets much better the worse your opponent is. 
---
The only places shamans are obviously better are heavy melee 5 mans in pve. And AB because a paladin can only really help defend they are terrible at taking a cap relative to a shaman do to lack of DPS. 
---
And obviously situationally if you're in a position to be aggressive shaman is better. But that's because of their ability to do damage not their support. And if you're picking a faction you shouldn't care about Shaman DPS all that much
---
Chillwind pass
---
Any vanilla zone excluding Duskwood and Tanaris
---
You can sit in shadowmeld while your pet destroys people and dismiss your pet whenever without having to come out.  I remember Savannah cats being one of the higher dps pets.

Shadowmeld + stealth cat

Hey man it's 2019 there's nothing wrong with being gay.
---
Large Pristmatic Shards, Void Crystals and Void Spheres as well :p
---
This questione is done every week and the answer is just the dame: no. A priest is a priest. You will raid even as a NE, plus.... can u give up on Shadowmeld+Mind Control combo?
---
Bruh your top post is a harambe meme
---
Classic i better for beginners. Its much more comprehensible, simplistic and fair, though you're met with challenging tasks *much* more frequently
---
It's obviously preference to some extent, but I do think that retail is far too complicated; you have close to no idea what youre doing as a noob in that game, and you dont get punished for it, so you have to dig a lot to learn
---
Oh, servers will be announced ahead of time? That should be very helpful, thanks!
---
the accuracy lol
---
And you never will **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
---
Better cities, gayer races, more colors, less chuck norris.
---
Thanks, that's the kind of  the role i'd enjoy playing.
---
All I know is that guilds in vanilla required shamans to have 5/8 T1 if they applied (when they were doing AQ-BWL) because they weren't running MC any more and the chain heal bonus was supposedly very good
---
Warriors were basically god tier in vanilla though.
---
If you're that casual then by the time youre even ready for it people will be pugging it or doing gold runs. You'll be A OK.
---
Carebear != Alliance. That's PVE server players. All PVP players are soldiers.
---
For me, Alliance has the best uncontested zones. Elywnn &gt; Westfall &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood with DM sprinkled in is a journey everyone who likes WoW should take. 
---
Best cities, with the exception of UC. Best architecture. 
---
Dwarves.
---
LOL well done
---
For the rest of us, this was a hilarious subversion of our expectations.
---
Solution: find a girlfriend that plays WoW as well.
---
Yeah that doesn't work in 1.12 with the DR's they added.
---
I logged into my vanilla level 60 guy, in stormwind, and he insta dinged level 61 =(
---
played both, mostly horde on the official servers. i keep rolling alliance in vanilla because i love levelig in duskwood. started horde on a pserver and payed until ~40, rerolled alliance because i could'nt take the entitled toxicity, felt like i encounter way more ninjas, griefers, straight up douches on horde side. hope it does not translate to the official classic servers. also aliance has beautiful cities. not just dirty huts, a toxic ruin and a big cattlefarm
---
Horde all day
---
I was an Alliance main and was always so jealous that I could stuck with Stockades
---
XD
---
I am okay with these memes.
---
I'm thinking that I'll have a hunter in vanilla because I love the class fantasy and I played Hunter from BC-Cata. I started in BC with a Paladin that I played until Cata too, but I am not sure if I'll play Paladin again. I would like to play a healing class so I'm thinking either a Nelf Priest, Nelf Druid, or Dwarf Paladin. I like being a Support in most other games but in WoW I've leaned more towards DPS and then Tanking in Legion with Demon Hunter. From what I've heard, Paladins and Druids are not good tanks, but I would like to do 5mans/Blackrock Spire for the most part after getting to 60 and some raiding. I work 8-5 and my weekends are taken up already so I'm not too sure which class would be good (besides Hunter as I'm going to do that no matter what).
---
Even if /sit works
---
Warrior tanks aren't purposely letting themselves get crit....lol
---
Prot paladins can of course work they just take time, no taunt, terrible. Not "try hardness". Who the fuck are these guys? Talking about some old build of mangoes like fucking matters.
---
Bleh
---
Ret paladins = retards. The game gives no incentive to use them unlike hunters which have all the same problems.
---
The base damage/gear doesn't consider resource type. So ret paladins like hunters have to waste stats on mana. 
---
No one gives a shit about 1.9 paladin talents we're not getting 1.9 paladin talents. Not even getting progressive itemization....

the worst part of playing alliance is killing taurens, especially their dying animation, it feels you are doing something wrong, i could never handle it.
---
As you say it’s not charity - why then is it greedy to charge for a good game?
---
BfA comes with an upfront expansion cost, Classic won’t
---
If your argument is that 13€/mth is too high, that’s a relative thing - it’s high for a lot of countries, it’s not so much for others. I agree that they should try to tier the cost by countries like some other pay2play services do
---
As to how hard it is to convert the game to modern infrastructure - I suggest you watch the blizzcon presentation, it’s not rocket science but it is a good solid workload
---
I’m suggesting that you have faith that Blizzard will produce good content for us and listen as they have been doing so - they don’t always get it right, but neither are they evil greedy thieves of doom
---
Speed is not as important as the stats it provides, usually.
---
They most likely won't. Perhaps the only reason to keep them in would to cater to pserver players, but that would be silly.
---
New game, fresh start, playing with friends.
---
Be the little gnome the roflstomps big, bulky orcs.
---
Name it after a bunch of private servers they shut down lol!
---
I'm not sure but please don't call me Weston.
---
Just go with what you will enjoy. I played horde for years then I just realised that I didn't really enjoy the horde that much. Then with recent events I couldn't see myself being part of a faction that kills so many people just because their told to. Long story sort since vanilla I've always wanted to play a gnome but with how their perceived by other players made go with something else but now I love my gnome warrior and can't wait to roll one on classic.
---
Female orcs don't slouch
---
I guess there's no guarantee... But that's the assumption, yes. I think that is even industry standard.
---
It's proven that /sit doesnt initate procs in Classic and will not be viable. If that is the best hope for Pally PvE outside of healing then they're fucked, lol
---
We were all WoW beginners back in 2005.
---
I love all the dirt and grime, though! I have no reference to alliance toxicity but I'll be running with guildies so hopefully I avoid it mostly.
---
Speed is not the most important thing, but generally start out slow then move to faster weapons as you get more gear
---
The saps allow diminishing returns to happen, and not all class trinkets break stun.
---
i would definitely play on death and taxes lol
---
I’m sure it won’t be a hard limit at say 150 people, it’ll probably be variable at say 125-175. I was more interested in how big the shards would be. Eg are they in the 150 range or 300 range or 50 range?
---
The biggest problem is not having the passive ability to gain mana from getting healed. So there's gonna be lots of drinking in between pulls in dungeons even if the healer has full mana.
---
All the new content potential is definitely getting me more excited :)

How will we bring back the legend of chuck Norris with no barrens chat?
---
&lt;3
---
Quick question, what DOES happen after Naxx?
---
Doesn't really matter. Provided the weapons are otherwise the exact same, a fast OH is *very very slightly* better because it gives you smoother rage generation in smaller chunks, reducing the danger of overcapping and wasting rage. In reality, this advantage is always less important than better stats, better DPS, or better weapon type (if you're Orc/Human or wearing Edgemaster's).
---
No Changes.      
---
I look forward to killing every Zhevra in the barrens 3 times to get 4 hooves.  It will be the authentic Vanilla experience. :)
---
I agree on your point there, but in my experience people do not reserve stuff when looking for lower level instances. It was in that case I made my reply, therefore using a lower level instance (Ulduman) as an example
---
Too late lol...I know what I'm missing out on there.
---
I’m once again waffling on what I want to play. I think I’m starting to settle on healing as a druid, but my concern now falls to viability outside raids. I’m not the biggest fan of feral dps. Is that the only viable leveling spec? And other than bear form FC, what is the viability in pvp(BG and world)? I’m definitely planning to tank 5 mans to help gear up, so I think that’ll help.
---
Warlock staying best dressed since prerelease.
---
I agree, what I meant was that hopefully this mechanic existed even in the original retail game and if so it should be implemented in Classic :)
---
I mean. The username sells this as the top comment
---
NOOOOOOOOO GOD NO!
---
I played on Thunderlord in vanilla, took a break from start of TBC-&gt;SoO era in MoP to play a bunch of other games, came back end of MOP and ended up on Mal'Ganis for end of MOP and WOD to join a progression raiding guild I had an invite to.   That, of course, fell apart so end of WOD I got off that hellhole (sorry mal'ganis...that server is the detroit of wow servers) and went to ED for Legion and BFA and will never leave ED if/when I ever play retail.  Excellent server.
---
Elune-Adore everyone, I’m rolling night elf priest and whoever says I shouldn’t can suck my dick
---
Haha yes you did. Had a great time during that stream too! 
---
I think theres a strong possibility of this week or possibly next having a huge announcement if thats what you're looking for. ;) 
---
I know blizzard has a huge success rate on finding sources of leaks and I'm guessing that comes from people giving out specifics on whats coming up. I have my own set of friends that give me information about what's going on but they're usually pretty cryptic and don't give me specific time frames or dates. If they do happen to give me specifics, I don't give those out to ANYONE because it could cost them their job and I'm not about to get anyone fired or in trouble for supplying a little information that will come in the next couple weeks.
---
There was plenty of Arms raiding in vanilla, back before 1.12 it was considered a Medium debuff prio, so it dropped of target, and it was decent damage. We even had a MS R14 who tanked in AQ.
---
Im not sure what you are arguing, you are saying it cant be done, or its not viable. Im telling you it is, the debuff slot is nothing to worry about when we get 16 to start with. It has been done before, and it will be done again.
---
This is the correct argument
---
You are an embarrassment to us all.
---
\-A Paladin main
---
No clue. But ideally they would be sub 100. It would definitely be nice if they could find the sweet spot, but I’m not sure such a perfect number exists. Anything from 50-100 would be viable for 1-6
---
Am undecided between warrior and basically every dps class. My main pick would be warrior since I truly enjoy tanking and enjoy the look, class fantasy etc. I'm not worried about the leveling experience since I've done that before. I am worried about life at 60. I would like to raid but probably won't be able to solidly commit to more than 1 or 2 raid nights a week with the rest having to be judged at the day of the raid. I assume this would make me unattractive as a raid tank. Would it be much easier to get a raid slot is another dps class in general? Or are dps or dps / tank hybrids as wanted as say mages, rogues or warlocks (my top 3 other classes atm). I played pretty nolife with very high raid attendance during vanilla so am not that familiar with the more relaxed raiding style (during Vanilla). 
---
Background: Mained Druid for a bit then Rogue for most of Vanilla. Mained Hunter for TBC. Mained prot pally ever since Wotlk. Never really enjoyed healing and don't feel competent enough at it to enjoy doing it in progress raids.
---
&gt; unnecessary reasons
---
Erm? What are those, then?
---
I always wished they would have made flying only areas, netherstorm was a perfect zone to make it so flying was required to get around to certain "islands". Delete some of the bridges and have more floating things. Shadowmoon valley could have had acid swamps everywhere making it impossible to explore with a ground mount. Just seemed lazy to introduce such a game breaking mechanic that ruined immersion and not capitalize on the flying aspect.  
---
 I know all that would require quest and progression reworks but it would have been really sweet to protect "old" zones and capitalize on the flying exploration. They needed to have a progression wall on flying unlock, and introduce it with a new area within netherstorm/smv that required the flying. It just never made sense.
---
I wonder how much this data is skewed by the people taking the survey.. People on this sub who are researching now and might have played private servers are more knowledgeable than players who are just going to pick up classic when it drops for fun/nostalgia.
---
eg. Hunter is seen as the most noob-friendly class which could turn off the hardcore crowd, but a casual player is just going to pick whatever they like the look of.
---
on alliance side it felt/like there are more beginners, noobs, sweet naive people, and i also encountered more roleplayers. somehow it feels to me that horde side has more cartmans, alliance more butters. dont underestimate butters because he can turn into professor chaos
---
I hate this meme when will it die
---
The only benefit I can see for playing Alliance is if your like me and want to play Druid, but really dont like playing Tauren.
---
If your into raiding, the Alliance cities are like a stones throw away from most of them for a very long time.
---
I wish I knew anyone excited to play Classic. I still have no idea what I'm going to play.
---
Reckadin is pvp I’m pretty sure
---
This is so on point.
---
You seem to forget how much the horde loves Redridge.
---
Mages are also superior tho.
---
You nearly had me convinced until you got to less Chuck Norris.
---
I had two mains back in the day. A gnome made and a gnome rogue. I really enjoyed both experiences and part of me wants to go back to one of these so I can re-live that same experience as an adult, but I kind of want to try something new.
---
Should I keep either the mage or rogue class, and just change my race? Or should I try something totally new, like Warlock, or Hunter?
---
My biggest priority is going to be PvP. Whatever the PvP system is, I want to be on top.
---
Tauren and orc warriors are the best and most beastly looking warriors in the game. Can't wait
---
The nicker
---
I read “fisting contest”.
---
Female night elf priests is top tier aesthetics and character fantasy value. Screw your fear ward!

BRD for life
---
Prot Paladins are viable for all 5/10 man content they are viable for aoe trash pulls like imps in MC and tanking a single target like a garr add but that’s it.
---
You don’t  have a taunt, you don’t have a way to generate mana, if you are defense capped you have a low mana pool and can’t keep up a rotation and holyshield is too mana hungry to keep up.
---
Not very viable.
---
lol yep, Don't trust a enchancement shaman shill to benchmark Fury warrior dps.
---
How bad is it? I don't mind losing a piece here or there, but is it going to be a constant struggle?
---
I wouldn't worry too much. One misplaced talent isn't gonna kill you while leveling. You're surely in the correct tree so it should be at least somewhat useful and might possibly even be a talent you were gonna get later so you just alter your path a bit. Once you hit 60 you're almost surely respeccing out of your leveling talents and that's where you're gonna be more careful.
---
No BM for me. MM is lyfe!
---
Open Broadcaster is free. You can stream as well as record. It might be what you’re looking for.
---
That's hardly what happened. I don't think there's as much animosity between the two groups as you think.
---
About the EU server stuff, you are gonna get more latency and depending on how good your internet is, it could be very bad or barely noticable.
---
So basically meme camping for that aim shot? Fun. But weak. 
---
Mind not changed. But damn I like kitties!
---
I'm thinking about mage too but honestly the endless frostbolt spam in raids is not appealing in any way. People say "but you manage your mana" ya just like everybody else with mana... :/
---
I will be happily roaming the jungle and poaching the animals with my boomstick. Not a single rogue will be able to stop me as I will not have slept since I began...
---
I never understood why people hate hims so much. I know he gets "excited" a lot, but his more calmer videos are really solid. Whats going on?
---
I know what to skip as Alliance. VanCleef questline escort is a major bottleneck as are many Westfall quests. Similarly Bingles' quest and miners gear in Loch Modan are impossible, among a few others. The 1-10 zones should be ok because of phasing, otherwise there are major bottlenecks too. 
---
I plan on getting to 10-12 -&gt; Moch Modan 14 -&gt; Dark Shore 16 -&gt; Westfall 17 -&gt; RR 18, then back to Darkshore or something else.
---
Just skip the bottlenecks guys. Last pserver launch people waited hours for defias escort and 30+ minutes for Hogger.
---
I've been having dreams and I'm not even that excited,  wtf is going on with me?
---
and those that don't ask stupid quest related questions in general chat constantly, and get the most common response from the community of "go get questie"
---
A shadowmelded 60 night elf hunter with a stealth pet just straight up camping near those mobs....
---
Just have a Diablo 2 like system where old stuff stays, new servers open and eventually merge those together.
---
Source on the armor statement?
---
You must be fun at raids
---
How else would you be able to click on rend?
---
Only thing i miss about TBC. The way they set up earning PvP gear was so much better.
---
Damn son, you just sapped him while he was standing in the fire
---
So maybe it's better and saves more space to stream and pull the vods at a later date?
---
The class that you maybe can bring one to a raid. RIP.
---
Wait what? Was firetree a reference to them burning down darnasus 15 years in advance?
---
Lok’Tar ogar! Brother
---
Honestly, reading your original post I wouldn't have even thought it was someone typing a foreign language! We all make miss takes :)
---
And the people that are saying "not everyone will want to use questie" will be the ones asking stupid quest related questions in general chat constantly, and getting the most common response from the community of "go get questie"
---
Being on the other side of it can be fun, too, ganking the gankers.
---
False. Does not have Ret paladin.
---
West fall jackie chan
---
I feel sorry for the idiots that actually made a line...LMAO...no I don't
---
You're in denial about not being that excited is all. Its fine, we've all been through that stage.
---
And then you have THAT ONE GUY who finishes getting 10 hooves in 10 kills and says, "Guys its not that hard."
---
Into the Night Elves
---
I’d let a prot paladin inside the raid for off-tanking trash and blessing of sanctuary. He would have to leave for bosses, of course, but I’d probably even let him stay in discord.
---
The spot is way out of the way and no one goes up there, you can be at it at 14.
---
/ty
---
What would the playtime look like for that I wonder? Sounds a bit OCD.
---
tier 2.5, its just the nature of being a melee in group fights with similarly geared players, its mostly ranged skirmishes from both sides unless you have part of a premade with you. When people have instants  casta that crit for 1.5k it only takes a few seconds to die regardless of your gear
---
I can view it fine
---
Thank you, good to know. I'm probably just going to start on an American server and play any time between 0700 and 1300 local time.
---
Perception is definitely a huge part of it. For example, Hunter is actually seen as one of the highest skill classes to play well ... But its DPS isn't great on later tiers. But it had the rep as being for noobs (because pets make leveling easy and because most hunters were bad lol).
---
Just depends on how many people really play!! The survey isn't perfect, but it had a good amount of responses.
---
Wow is pretty unique in being such an old game PC that gets rereleased and you are right that it would not affect the PC playing population ........  
---
directly.....   
---
But the fear is that it would very much indeed affect them indirectly...  By leading towards more PC developers thinking:  hey we don't have to design games for the PC at all anymore... This is already going on is the general opinion (dunno if it's true or not, I don't follow mainstream AAA titles that much these days)   
---
As for your Fallout 3 and NV counter examples, I only see that as confirmation of the idea that games evolve towards simpler console versions.   When Fallout 3 was in development they already used a multi platform engine but they still had (somewhat) of the PC origins mindset so it was still a little more sophisticated.  PC gamers already were very disappointed with some aspects of the game (see also Oblivion, made with the same engine)    But a few years later they knew they could get away with dumbing it down a bit more, result fallout 4.    
---
As for the cost differences, these are growing towards each other too.   A current generation console is about the same price as a budget PC these days and if you look at second hand material you can have yesterday's game PC for the price of today's console.  I am not saying Pc gaming is cheaper,  but the days that a game PC was $1500 and a console $300 are over.  Sure a top end game PC still is that expensive, but that is not needed to game. You can have a lot of fun for far less.   If we look at WoW, you can play that on a 10 year old PC you pick up for $50 or less at the local charity shop. And have better performance than the original vanilla players in 2005.   With the classic update you will need a little more, but you get the point, you don't need a  NVIDIA 2060 to play wow Classic
---
Your arguments are bland. I think your conclusion is right, but my god are you doing the topic an injustice
---
I heard she's fresh
---
I'm rolling shaman, the respec costs are an issue but if you make good use of your professions and penny pinch whenever you can you should be fine.
---
I personally won't be bothering with pvp until phase 2 with the release of the honour system, which should give me plenty of time to save up for respec costs anyway.
---
shamans don't really face much competition for gear, while warlocks indeed do.
---
hopefully this is helpful?
---
Damnit Pam. Got me all hyped for naddah..
---
On one hand its a pain in the ass to get camped.
---
But typically youre talking about 5/10 min before they move on.
---
But rolling up on someone your level when they are half dead fighting the mob you need for a quest... priceless.
---
I think he was saying that you can use OBS to Stream (if you want) and also record at the same time to your Hardrive.
---
Be advised that if you want to record on a quality that doesn't look like a potato you're going to need a decent chunk of extra space to store your footage. If you plan on trimming out the boring parts (running to and from town with nothing happening, etc) then you can cut down on the space a bit but that takes time as well and requires video editing software.
---
You only need 4 hooves!
---
Hold right click tap left click to run, reicht click to turn liberal click to look around. That was mainly so I could enjoy stuff on my other monitor in HS though
---
If you don't play music. Twitch will mute your vods if you play music on them if you don't have the rights to. 
---
Videos don't take up THAT much space, so i'd recommend getting a 1TB external and storing them all on there or something. 
---
OBS is definitely the way to go though for that. Would be cool if whereever you game is set up in a way where you could both be on webcam too =).
---
True but /sit still wont work. That was a private server thing
---
Not crazy at all. I've never had trouble leveling on a PvP server. Supposedly it took about 20% longer or something to reach 60 on PvP servers vs PvE, which really in't that much of a difference. I find it more immersive with the added danger and staying on your toes, though. You'll get corpse camped sometimes, and STV is a meme for a reason, but it isn't game breaking.
---
I suck at PvP. That has never, ever stopped me from enjoying the hell out of it. It's fine!
---
I've pretty much settled on a human rogue, I'm excited to get started. But I read in another thread that gearing as a rogue is really difficult, but warriors take all your gear?
---
How severe is this? Is it a rare occurrence or is gearing going to be a constant struggle?
---
&gt;it isnt exactly like some lvl 60 will roll up in your startingzone 
---
They can't, even
---
Your not wrong about paladins but plenty of people farm pummelers for every raid from mc to naxx..
---
You need like 2-3 per raid and once you have shit on farm you can use none if you want
---
Several stuff wrong here:
---
Standing 1 gets 13.000 CP not 12.000 CP, if you get 12.000 CP you can hit rank 14 after minimum of 70 weeks which is wrong, 12 weeks is with 13.000 and that is right. 
---
Second wrong thing is that CP assigned for everyone under standing 1 is not really known. Bracket cut off points were changed in several patches including 1.12. We have no idea what version we will get and even if we get 1.12 version its data is based off 1 live server (from retail vanilla) so percentage cut off points can be different and are not fixed, but relatable to standing 1.
---
Third thing is if you want to go for ranking you want a big server not a small one like you suggest. Reason is, if the server is small enough, only way to advance is with standing 1, meaning there is no way there is going to be a pvp team that will wait out weeks just so a single team member can move through ranks and eventually  get to rank 14, meaning if you were 10th in turn it will take you a minimum of a minimum of 120 months of constant pvp to get your rank, which is not realistic and can result in pvp dead realms. Besides that since the system works on percentages, the more people there are on the server it is actually relatively easier to get up in rank .
---
I would suggest looking into server balance rather. I ranked to 14 back in retail vanilla and we had 50+ min queue times for alliance and under 1 minute for horde. This resulted in horde premade constantly dodging alliance premade (because it was super easy for them to just leave and get in another game, compared to us) and because of fast games they would get ahead of everyone on horde side fast and would have actual days off. So for us this resulted in 50 min wait and absolute stomps (because horde would be leaving game we would play for example 10 vs 1 or 2 or 3 man WSG) and non stop play, since someone could with no premade just play a lot and even though you win every game, due to low amount of games you don't get safe ahead like horde does, resulting in no days off.
---
So either join a balanced server or join a server with lower chosen faction.
---
Also don't try to take standing that does not belong to you. There is a simple rule, highest rank should get highest standing. Premades rotate their members to assure this (and if you don't respect this you get thrown out of premade and never hit any high rank), and if an outsider mingles in there , they must all play to make it up for this.
---
Stitches
---
I've taken stuff for off spec before. The most tense situation I had was when I was leveling my troll rogue and shadow craft helm dropped. I think it was scholomance and other rogue was in group. I won roll and he was begging me and other person in group was like just give to him. Think this went on for about 30 mins. I said I've screenshotted all of this and if you don't give me the item I'll raise a ticket. Eventually they gave me it but I recently hit 60 and my gear was crap. So I was so happy
---
All of what you described on that private server is virtually identical to my first WoW experience back in 2007 (during Burning Crusade but close enough). It was so much different of a feeling.
---
It was my first MMO, during a time when I ignorantly didn't think online RPGs would even work. Having persistence with the character, seeing everyone else's character, and seeing the hugeness of the world was such a treat. I remember finding a chest in a little rock alcove or whatever surrounded by grells and I felt like I discovered Excalibur or something. I eventually got to the gates of Darnassus and was like wow, this is THE capitol! I figured there were more areas beyond it. I did not expect multiple capitols across a ton of other zones the size of Teldrassil and across two continents. I was mind-blown and chastised myself for avoiding WoW prior to that.
---
I won't be able to relive the sense of wonder and discovery to that degree, but I know TBC changed a fair amount of the game from vanilla, so there will be plenty of new things to rediscover in addition to having that sense of community in a game full of life. :D
---
Does this all still hold true on an less than stellar geared alt? I'm going to be a healer main, and in my off time I want to level a class for farming.
---
Are these still the best options if I'm not decked out in raid gear or sick dungeon loot?
---
Sort of same story. I started playing in cata on my brothers account, didn’t get my own account till post SOO during mop. After a few years, I heard of private servers and tried one out around the end of 2017. Got to level 10 on a human warrior, which is probably the most fun thing I have ever done in wow. After that, I realized that I was just going to start over when classic released, and so I just quit. But when classic comes out, it’s gonna be so much fun.
---
kind of hard to find one who wants a wow addict
---
1st - You pay a normal wow sub and get to play classic during your sub time. 
---
2nd - With that, you are playing for a dead sad game that is BFA and get a good game (classic) that isn't worth 13€ (the sub price), because it's a 14 year old game.
---
3rd - the fact that those special one time mounts that were removed and now are back into the game are a sign that they are evil greedy thieves of doom, because sub prices can't pay their coke buckets so they have to milk players with MTX and other bullshit.
---
4th - If they gave wow classic an independent (without being tied to BFA) sub price, and at a reasonable price like 4-6 bucks, I would love to pay for it. But I won't pay 13 bucks because as they say: You are getting 2 games for the price of 1, because I don't give a dead ass goblin tits fuck about BFA.
---
If you love pvp like i do, i would roll dwarf rogue and go daggercombat spec. It's slightly behind of combat swords but you would get faster good daggers for pvp and could justify it for better loot distribution to raid leader.  I will do this, if i go rogue.
---
&gt;A realm transfer in any capacity, free or payed, for a new server is the worst idea ever and I don't even think blizzard are dumb/greedy enough to do that.
---
But they already have....during vanilla...tbc...wotlk...cata...and so on. We know they are dumb/greedy enough
---
Flod to reddit!
---
*flood
---
Not only this, but if we don't get an announcement soon, that guy who refuses to eat is going to die.
---
If this is the spot to not throw large stones at your poor life choices, ecto-plasmic distiller is a really good item to get for the AQ phase. It generates a considerable amount of threat when used properly. Seeing as threat is one of your biggest hurdles as a prot pally
---
Let's go for DnT! With all the drama that existed irl in the guild. I still have some NSFW pics on a harddrive somewhere...
---
My guess is that things will generally work the way they did back then.  If server names are released ahead of time, I'd watch the official WoW boards and here to see where people are going (and to avoid streamers, where people are not going).  
---
If not announced prior to, most big guilds will probably do what they did in 2004 - pick the first server that starts with "X" letter of their particular playtype (PvP, PvE, RP) once launched.  That's how I ended up on Archimonde originally.  
---
But my guess is they're going to release server names ahead of time.  And your concern is a valid one, especially with regard to tourists.  Pick your server wisely.
---
Right ok yeah I get you! Yeah that's a really good idea thanks so much!
---
If ur gonna tank? You gotta burn em otherwise ur threat not gonna be high enough and you should just use warrior
---
What they dont known ain't gonna hurt em
---
That's awesome. I wish you the best on Classic! I've always found the old world much easier to get immersed in.
---
Yeah it sounds like they're putting a ton of labor into this. I'm just so glad they're finally doing it
---
If you have good raid attendance you'll have a spot no matter what race you are. 40 people can be a challenge to fill
---
I played a Gnome Mage in Vanilla and I always remember being jealous of warlocks. It was like they could be just as strong, but they also get the pet. My 14 year old mind always had this thought of “why the heck am i playing mage when i can play warlock and get a pet too. It may be harder cause of pet micro but i can do it!” I also thought i’d get more raid loot and raid spots because of the shortsge on locks back in vanilla. I rerolled in TBC on the horde as a BE Warlock and thats still my main today even though i have no desire whatsoever to play BfA or modern WoW ever again. If i were to start over in vanilla 2004 it would be as a gnome warlock, but today I am more of a healer and will be rocking a troll priest with an undead warlock alt.

My suggestion to you would be to try gnome warlock this time around. I dont think warlocks will be underplayed as they were in my vanilla experience but you will rip in pvp and can still pump out dps in pve...heck, sac the pet and youre a shadow mage
---
Sadly mt vacation had to be plan before 26 of april, so i took a safe bet and went for 9 August to 28 of August
---
This but unironically
---
Got my hopes up for a blue post haha
---
They did this for new servers in vanilla? I don't remember that at all, care to share a source?
---
Poverty my old friend. Guess I’ll just farm herbs and sneak into early raids as 30/0/21
---
Yeah that's a good shout on the hard drive. Omg yeah that would be great, I'll look into webcams :) yeah I don't play much music when I play and the vanilla OST is amazing so I'll go with that!
---
I have played on and off since Classic, but I've convinced three friends who have never played WoW to join me on the journey of Classic.
---
I need to know what classes would best compliment their choices. One wishes to be a tank, and wants to be a warrior. One also wants to be a tank, and wants to be a druid, and I've told them that he will be able to do a bit of everything. Another player is wanting to heal, and is wanting to be a shaman.
---
So in the end, I need a dps that can go along with a warrior tank, dps druid, and healing shaman. We will mainly be looking at doing five man content.
---
Unconvential for this sub, typical of 99% of the playerbase.
---
Most people don't obsess over this game like we do.
---
Pally buffs &amp; human sword racial
---
Good god you had 4K in vanilla?
---
Seems like sustainability should be as easy as running servers in 'ladders' or 'seasons' similar to Diablo 2 or 3.
---
Yeah,I think alot of people that complain about getting camped are just insta running back and respawning to die again.  Of COURSE they're gonna keep killing you if you keep feeding them kills.  If you get killed twice by the same guy and you know you can't beat him, try running back to your corpse...NOT rezzing...and going to get a drink/bathroom break/snack/etc.  A 5-10min break is not going to hurt your progression and will mean said ganker is gone like 99% of the time.
---
Hahahahaha
---
&lt;Sorry&gt; | NA | PvP | Alliance | EST/CST
---
Introduction:
---
On behalf of all guild members, I would just like to say to the horde, we're sorry... Sorry... is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of 10-15 players, at first, for specific roles in pre-made PvP. However, we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore we expect to run many preraid dungeons, to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer. Whether that means forming alliance with other small guilds or recruiting more people, we'll do what it takes.
---
Raid Times:
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We still need at least one:
---
- Priest
---
- Warlock
---
But we are taking anyone interested.
---
https://discord.gg/9jENjfM
---
No trinkets literally unplayable
---
lol if you look at the rest of the answers, you xan see the answer is indeed yes.
---
fwiw - dwarves have a very satisfying jump. My favorite in the game.  
---
like, its really difficult to not want to jump everywhere, all the time.
---
Leveling zones that don't look like they came out of the oven. Cities with beautiful architecture. Dwarves.
---
Look for a guild that has multiple raid groups, then you can just fit in w/e, there will as likely be night shift guilds
---
Commenting for later use
---
&gt; Yes you will be killed, griefed, and camped at times
---
This is also largely during the leveling phase, assuming you aren't one of those few way ahead of the curve.  Once you're max level this is just part of the gameplay, not the getting camped but rather having battles and conflict all over
---
No, I'm fully aware of how to pick a fight, not sure why people just automatically assume the worst in people.
---
All I'm doing is trying to provide some perspective for potential future rogues in classic, your job isn't on the frontlines, you have very little damage mitigation and if the enemy team is worth their salt you will be focused down.
---
When you talk about pvp probably 80% of the player base thinks fighting in the middle of wsg is what you are talking, and rogues absolutely suck at that
---
Thats how they get you to grind
---
Thought people were saying July 16th
---
To get a spot in a raiding guild you need high attendance. If you cant do that, then maybe pugging raids would be a better solution.
---
Those level 11 wandering bastards
---
Im pretty positive it worked for original release too. Now if they allow it for classic that’s another thing. I honestly don’t really care.
---
The one shot kazzak would be hilarious to see.
---
When i used to play rogue and i'd used up all my CD's i just used to sit back and pick out someone that was low on health haha
---
Nice dude
---
I would go either mage or warlock.
---
Best to kill that area with a group
---
I use arrow + mouse :)
---
All my spells are on the numpad, and I jump with my pinkie on spacebar.
---
Yes, I have big hands, been playing like this since I was 10
---
Stop it guys, you are so intense
---
Only fury warriors will take your gear. They basically use the same stuff except warrior can also use mail/plate.
---
Youll just get to 60 qnd end up healing anyways just like every other wannabe special snowflake prot pally. The warrior tanks will laugh at you.
---
So, where is the next one?
---
Haha at the time I was a proud 11 year old, I’m pretty sure I had some rando enchants too.
---
Ion said in an interview that they weren't planning on having them available for launch, but said they'd be open to implementing them later if there was enough interest. Since then, he's only said that they're not philosophically opposed to the servers, they're only worried about lack of interest and long term server population. 
---
That means those of us who want to play on that server type have to make a lot of noise. Otherwise, we'll have to choose between roleplaying and PVP.
---
yeah, i intend to do herb/alch for cash while healing in raids. once the main raiders gear up you can probably start asking for dps drops from the clears for your ele spec.
---
No, but I do wish they'd lock people from creating more toons on one faction if things get too out of balance.
---
Bobby Hill
---
Same. I'm Alliance for life.
---
That’s easy though, many run around in 2800-3500 HP and you basically deal true damage to them.
---
Bursting a warrior or mail wearer before they get to react is something people don’t see every day.
---
I miss duels in front of Org being a thing in retail vanilla. Nobody really did that on pservers.
---
Mage. Always a mage. (Best crowd control dps for 5 man stuff)
---
Fury warriors are one of the best dps classes in the game. You can tank dungeons as fury and dps raids as fury as well.
---
Play warlock and show off how good you can S U C C for shards...on a serious note, i think youre not giving the warlock enough kudos and should give it a shot. Dots arent as flashy as big crits but controlled death by attrition is something you dont forget the taste of. You can also play some of the other nuke builds too
---
You might be able to hold a spot as a swing-tank / off-tank in the guild. The key to maintaining the flexibility in schedule would be the work you put in outside of raid nights. Be available to tank dungeon runs or provide crafting resources to the guild. Ideally, your efforts will be rewarded in that they'll take you with on the one night you're available.
---
Remember that a fair amount of players at endgame this time will be veterans of early WoW who are now much older than they were and will likely have the same commitments and restrictions you have, so expect to see "adult" guilds that will put an emphasis on getting level-headed, responsible players to make the most of limited raid times.
---
Do they typically get priority because they can also tank? Or is it just up to the rolls?
---
Id be fine for any expantion up untill Warth. then it can stop.
---
I buff you, you buff me, we’re a buffing family. With a great big buff and a buff from me to you. Won’t you say you’ll buff me too!
---
If you are casual, do not worry about being best min max class race.  Play what you want.
---
Most raids bring a lot more than 1-2 warlocks. They are in high demand esp on the alliance side (most locks roll horde because they don't wanna deal with the UD racial).
---
Curious about playing a mana battery?
---
Bis purple shirt?
---
You are retarded if you think the [Healing Shield](https://itemization.info/item/22819) outmitigates the [Tank Shield](https://itemization.info/item/23043) because of 69 armor.
---
Holy shit, this was amazing. I've never been super into WoW lore but this just convinced me to go research the horde races, which I'll be playing for the first time in Classic.
---
I try to be, yeah. What does this have to do with anything?
---
Druids make the best flag carriers in WSG. Other than that you'll probably just be healing in BGs.
---
Episode 103...You still keep asking about classic healing....
---
They're all extremely basic. And all just spamming the same thing over and over. Or should be. Priests should spam heal because it's their most efficient spell. They' don't because they're bad
---
Not because it's optimum
---
Heads up - Discord link seems to be expired.
---
Maaaaaaaaage...food, water, and portals, a noobs godsend in a large new world
---
I mean, although I do want more content *at some point*, I would never expect new content any sooner than like 3 years from now. I full on plan to enjoy Classic for a super long time.
---
I'm on the fence, honestly. I love World of Warcraft, and if they ever did decide some time from now to add new content to the vanilla servers, I wouldn't say no.
---
Either way we have years of fun to look forward to.
---
&gt; worst alliance starting region
---
You shut your whore mouth. Teldrassil is the GOAT.
---
Holy fuck do i need to get checked for autism now?
---
At a minimum they had free transfers off certain high pop servers. I was on Illidan and almost did it.
---
Funny enough I don't ever recall saying that.
---
All I'm trying to do us temper peoples expectations, people think they are going to open on a healer in the backlines get a kill and then vanish into the night.
---
More often than not your sitting there staring at a flag hoping somebody shows up to take it, it isn't a class for impatient players. There is a reason premades run very few rogues and that's because they don't excel in group pvp
---
Faction choice, no. I’m going ally. It will however affect server choice. I would prefer the server be as balanced as possible.
---
Wow we're really getting spoiled with The Office themed gifs today
---
No exp gain from bgs in vanilla
---
Yeah but some new hard af raids on the same level as existing raids would be cool after awhile
---
LOL at all these people trying to deter the playerbase from rolling Rogues, out of pure fear of getting their shit pushed in by hordes of Rogues once classic launches. "They are only really good with cooldowns!", as if this is something new for Rogues or as if this somehow makes them bad. Nice try, guys.
---
Also, "they are useless in large scale PvP" is false if you are a good Rogue. Rogues lockdown potential on enemy healers is strong in large scale PvP, and their ability to peel for their own healers is still some of the best in the game, and can turn the tide of a large scale battle.
---
Usually up to the rolls. No one will let a fury warrior roll on leather because of tanking. Tanks only wear mail before 40 and plate after.
---
I use addons. The default raid and party frames suuuuuuck, and I wasn't satisfied with them until WoD. The raid frame profiles, extra indicators, use raid frames as party frames, etc were good additions to the default raid frames but customizing indicators and stuff was still too limited in my opinion.
---
I didn't heal until late TBC, and not very much. I didn't start healing regularly until Wrath, and I used Grid+Clique and a 10 button mouse. That's really all I need, because that's all the customization I need right there. When I quit I was using Grid2 with a custom made profile for all healing classes with indicators filtered only to what that specific class needed to worry about monitoring.
---
The vanilla UI is insufficient in my opinion. It's clunky, lacks important information, it's laid out in about as useless a manner as humanly possible, it just isn't up to par.
---
Most UI suites don't do raid frame indicators the way I want, either. They're still clunky, ugly, and usually not customizable enough. My preference lies with Grid2+clique.
---
In classic raiding was exclusive to the hard core. You had to prep before the raid which meant spending time to get potions, reagents, gear, studying the raid mechanics, and then spend the evening(s) meeting up with 39 other people to put in the hours once inside. It was typically a 2 or 3 night a week endeavor. 
---
I hear it might be a little more casual but if they nerf it too much it won't be a classic experience. 
---
Its not impossible but finding a bunch of casuals willing to lightly commit to a consistent schedule with upkeep will be tricky. 
---
You best chance at raiding is if your significant other wants to raid as well.
---
Stop it! You made me think this is for real
---
Haha, that’s the dream :) thanks for the info
---
Resto Druid or Shadow spriest?
---
Yep! I used to watch my best friend play at her house every day.
---
I asked my parents if I could play but they didn’t want to pay for my sub and I was too young to have any income let alone a debit card.
---
Finally started playing when Cata came out and loved it. So I’m actually really excited to be able to go back and play the version I watched as a kid.
---
I played as alliance(human warrior) for Nostalrius and regretted every second that I wasn't an Orc instead.
---
I'm not gonna roast you, being left alone in Ironforge while your whole guild goes raiding without you is plenty of pain for one man.
---
It can be pretty tough to get geared as a rogue; you and fury warriors share a lot of pre-raid BiS gear, and both of those classes are heavily played. In regards to exactly how severe it will be, its anybody's guess: we just don't know how the class distribution on Classic will be, how it will look at endgame etc. Factor in your ability to make friends and find groups and it really becomes difficult to gauge. 
---
Getting pre-raid BiS is probably the hardest part of playing a rogue. It will be a challenge, but I don't think its any harder than the challenges other classes face; I wouldn't let it turn you off if you are excited about it.
---
90% of my BG PvP is just looking for clothies low on health  
---
People seem to think youre supposed to play a rogue like a warrior and just run into battle destroying shit left right and centre...  
---
Pick your battles. Take out the people on low health. 1/2 shot the clothies, Take out the people on the sidelines.
---
I am really hoping this turns out to be true. I loved vanilla but I started late and am realizing now how little of vanilla I actually experienced. Two kids and three mortgages later, in classic I'm definitely going to be a filthy casual looking to see it all.
---
Which is perfectly fine as long as those options for servers to transfer to are low populations and also will help re-balance factions.
---
You should never be able to transfer to a NEW server, or an overpopulated server, or to the overpopulated faction on an unbalanced server.
---
Everything outside of those restrictions and I think server transfers a fine and can actually be a good thing, especially if it can address unbalanced faction issues.
---
Oh, The Office meme. Fly high, my friend.
---
i use WASD walking for sure. 
---
QERFC1234 and ctrl QER1234 for spells
---
V for kick
---
T for mount
---
remembering to vanilla days i was such a noob using the arrow keys for walking and klicking the spells... but being a noobie back then as 11yo :D looking foreward to now using my real keybinds for classic let me feel the joy for it :D
---
Nobody remembers their time in the Shimmering Flats on a PVE server. You picked up some scrap metal and killed buzzards probably. I still remember my two friends and I getting into a rolling hour-long brawl with two higher level Alliance all across the zone 15 years later.
---
PVP servers will give you more of a rush. Whether it's rocking up to someone and claiming what's theirs or turning the tables on an attempted gank, nothing will get your pulse going like that on a PVE server. That's what creates the warm memories.
---
What is your endgame?
---
Was there actually any update?
---
&gt; Thing is, mages can also aoe farm the dogs in DM North.
---
If mob pathing works like it did in actual vanilla yes.  If mob pathing works like it does on retail, no.  I believe based on the demo there is some question of which version of mob pathing we'll get.
---
I thought the experience freezing was after vanilla and that you didn't get anything but honor in PVP during vanilla BGs, world PvP, etc.
---
If you listened to that to learn how to ret
---
Your parents should have done that when you and esfand were children
---
~ 1 2 3 4 5 Q E  T F Z X C scroll up, down, click mouse4 mouse 5.
---
Shift + one of the above.
---
Scroll up and down are underrated.
---
Yup.
---
Im probably set on restoshaman, but what race? I think troll would be coolest and i have never played troll, but man those tauren and orc racials are so good for pvp..
---
I've always enjoyed the gun sound but I can easily see why it could drive some people crazy.
---
How does pugging work? I've never gotten to the point of raiding, am super inexperienced with guilds, and I've seen people advertising spots for pugs. Would I still be able to gain some decent loot from the raid?
---
I would find another guild if I was you. Horde for life :)
---
In vanilla I used the old belkin n52 gaming pad. Movement was left thumb on the dpad, turned with the mouse. 
---
All abilities were bound on the buttons for my left hand fingers for my first action bar 1 through =. 
---
Then I had a key on the gaming pad that when pressed and held changed all the finger buttons to an entirely different set / action bar (f1-f12).
---
So in total I had 24 bound action bar spots that had dedicated keys.
---
I dunno why but everytime i see a Dwarf Rogue it just feels weird, like my brain telling me they dont exist lol.
---
When drooling idiots stop upvoting them.
---
Can’t watch
---
I rolled on my first ever PVP server on a private server, it added a fun element to leveling for me, yes sometimes it was a little frustrating when you find yourself against that one camper, but also I met some new friends/guildies by teaming together to help each other. For me it felt like another aspect of learning and knowing those on your server and actually having a bigger community feel which is a huge aspect of Vanilla.
---
Yeah that does kind of suck. I'd love RP-PvP but I am not willing to reroll down to the road.
---
It did not start because of a petition. It started because Blizzard wants to protect its intellectual property rights. Brack even stated they'd discussed letting Nostalrius continue, but legally it wasn't clear if they could protect and enforce all their I.P. rights while licensing a pserver (or even just ignoring it for that matter).
---
It didn't take a petition for Bizz to see vanilla WoW is still a popular, viable market any more than it did for you or I to see that it is.
---
Not knocking the petition, or the people who signed it, just saying it's a bit naive to assume this is happening because of an online petition. It isn't. It was probably in the works before that.
---
Unfortunately for me, DPS shaman isn't going to be a thing, which puts me either wanting to go mage or rouge. 
---
I'm also feeling like I'll be playing this more casually and just enjoying the leveling/exploring. So I'm leaning more mage. Am I making a terrible mistake?
---
I like to hide in their corpses as a gnome on the battlefield.
---
&gt; I played a Gnome Mage in Vanilla and I always remember being jealous of warlocks. It was like they could be just as strong, but they also get the pet. My 14 year old mind always had this thought of “why the heck am i playing mage when i can play warlock and get a pet too. It may be harder cause of pet micro but i can do it!” I also thought i’d get more raid loot and raid spots because of the shortsge on locks back in vanilla. I rerolled in TBC on the horde as a BE Warlock and thats still my main today even though i have no desire whatsoever to play BfA or modern WoW ever again. If i were to start over in vanilla 2004 it would be as a gnome warlock, but today I am more of a healer and will be rocking a troll priest with an undead warlock alt.
---
&gt; 
---
I like this idea! I also loved the idea of having a pet. Glad to hear you switched over and had more fun with it. Going to do some more digging into Warlocks now to make sure. Thanks for the tip!
---
We're expecting our first child due in Autumn. I can play the AH right... right?
---
So many naysayers saying Classic won't have enough to do. Many... Twinking was fucking great. I can't wait to so this again. Tiers 19 and 29 for life!
---
Stoneform shits on other rogues
---
i played other games before i got into wow so wasd + rmb was natural fit from the moment i logged in.
---
More quality memes like this, less GTA meme.
---
Yeah, but honestly in my personal experience as ling as your personable and go the extra mile for your guildys + consumes etc. I never had any problem being brought to raids. Even when it was 8 debuffs. Then again i wasnt in cutting edge guild but we did clear a large portion of all content before i quit
---
Most zones are fairly chill. Places like STV you might get ganked regularly or even camped sometimes, though. Part of the fun, though.  
---
IMO PvP breaks up the monotony of questing/levelling, taking a break and getting into an SS v TM war, or going to find that dick that killed you earlier on to camp him, stuff like that.
---
bubble + HS
---
kek
---
What does this mean ?
---
If you have an Nvidea card you can grab the GeForce experience. I’ve had a few issues with it but I seem to have gotten it working again recently. You can set keybinds to start/stop recording to either your hard drive or a streaming service like Twitch. Perhaps the best for your situation though is the “save last 5 minutes” keybind. If something funny/cool/intense happens while you two are playing you can just hit that button and save the clip to your computer
---
Prot specs with armor penetration-stacked ICC gear flew past viable and into OP territory really quick back then.  You could kill literally anyone except maybe (maybe) blood DKs without much effort.  The damage and control were just absolutely nuts.  Remember African Turtle Cleave?
---
This is entirely subjective and unhelpful advice. I have over the years seen every single class callled "the most boring class in the game." You list out valid weaknesses but you could take any class and list out its weaknesses, then dismiss it as garbage.
---
I thought aoe farm/grind mages only run 2/3 imp blizz so it doesn't overwrite the longer CoC snare.   I was under the impression you only run 3/3 imp blizz for DMN dog farm and basically no other circumstance.
---
This is insanely incorrect. Troll's Racial are straight up better than a sliver of extra HP.
---
That's what I get for playing Alliance. :(
---
You get the idea though.
---
I feel the same way. I want to live in AV like I used to. But do raids as well. Rogue and mages are amazing for both, not sure which one will be more fun..  I'm also leaning towards druids because that was my class in vanilla. And druids are just so fun and diverse.
---
My suggestion is go for it but main dps at 60. Dps Warr is very good (top tier I would say) and guilds would require less commitment and probably less attendance, a dps it's easier to replace or PUG. Personally if I were a GM even of a laid-back guild I would still try to find a trusted tank that is able to be there at least *most* of the time, a smooth tanking makes all the raid easier and faster. If you have OS tank gear you will be asked to off-tank in various encounters that require more than two tanks.
---
Around lvls 55 warr tanks (well, tanks in general) become the most needed class/spec in the game. Expecially if you get to 60 very early. It will be easy to find a spot in instances or to make people join your group, so you could just take people that don't roll gear against you and get both tank and dps gear. You can tank all 5-man instances with dps spec or just respect for the raids (if you can afford it). 
---
As for the other questions, Pala tanks and dps are not a thing in vanilla, they just heal in raids. Some guilds will have a Feral Druid for off-tanking and utility, but never more than one, most Druids will heal as well. Shamans too, Ele is good for pvp but raiders will be Resto, maybe one Enh if it is carried. 
---
Mages, Rogues and Locks are instead very needed, Mages and Rogues are top spot dps (along with Warr) and Locks have any kind of useful stuff for raiding.
---
thanks i was just going based off logs that i saw from private servers, i only saw a couple locks on most
---
It more than balances, on p.servers at least. No one wants to play the niche classes so they are always sorely needed.
---
Hahaha..IKR? I just couldn't, though. the core group of guys has been playing together since day 1. Some of us much longer than that.
---
The gnoll camps just down the hill are even better.
---
So I'm going to main mage (tailor/enchant) for raiding but I was thinking a hunter for herb/alch/cook/fish is the best class for a consumable alt.
---
Ok that's sounds really handy, kind of solves the issue of a lot of editing down the line, just got to remember to press it hahaha
---
You don’t need Westfall if you’re doing Darksore, you’ll outlevel most of the quests.
---
But if were you I wouldn’t skip Deadmines. You don’t need to do The People’s Militia chain, it’s not required at all. Only The Defias Brotherhood chain. Personally I suggest doing it, because getting a blue at that level is pretty bitching and will last you until 30.
---
&gt; buffed some folk flagged for PvP then got ganked and camped
---
if you play on pvp server, you can't get accidentally flagged :)
---
I used to have a fancy mouse, never used for WoW but another MMO. Problem with them is you're forced into that form factor. After wasting a few hundred dollars on mice i got rid of it
---
I use 1 2 34 5 6 Q ER T Y A S D F G Z X C V B N
---
And then I use Crtl, Shift, Alt, and Crtl + Shift as modifiers.
---
If you bind everything you might want to use in combat including things like trinkets you're looking at well over 100 binds. So the 12 button mouse looks good when you're hitting crtl + shift 3 lol
---
I dont really like alt for in combat binds so i use crtl+shift
---
I've played on p servers too and I have to agree with this sentiment. I have only gotten my ass ganked in world pvp. Looking forward to being able to quest in peace and doing bg's.
---
Nailed it.
---
Holy smoke if people here are toxic AF.
---
One of my guildies is a 250+ pound MMA fighter. Monster man who only rolls warrior. He's hypes as fuck to roll a gnome.
---
Blizzard’s modern servers can’t handle that many people together at once anymore
---
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Shift 1-5, Ctrl 1-5
---
* Rebind A and D to strafe freeing up Q and E
---
*  Q, E, F, G, shift and ctrl of these also
---
* \`, F1-F5, and Alt versions of the above if necessary
---
* I'll use num pad for actions i dont need to be quick to
---
* middle click auto run, mouse 3 is a movement ability like ghost wolf, travel form, blink etc, mouse 4 mount
---
Not entirely applicable to thread title but I didn't feel it warranted a thread either. I'm thinking about rolling a healer and wanted to make sure I understood the process.
---
For levelling healers, my understanding is the best way to level is to use an optimal levelling spec. Along the way collect any spare intellect gear (if not int class) and slap it on if you are doing a dungeon. At 60 you respec, and this spare gear becomes your main gearset that will be used to gear up for real.
---
If you plan to primarily pvp horde is probably a good decision. Orc racials are very good, and you wont deal with undead rogues.
---
Yeahh hahah I forget often. I think you can change the quality and length of time it saves. Also your best bet is immediately after grabbing a clip, open the folder where it is saved and rename it so you can remember what happened. Otherwise you end up with like 30 clips with only a time stamp and date
---
You must be fun at parties /s
---
Holy shit get the burn ward in here
---
I believe I heard John Staats say they had trouble with doing the head armor pieces because they had to be adaptive for every race and that it took some time to get it right.
---
that's not until tbc
---
Any of the drunk NPCs.
---
Is there an easy way to search / see all the blue posts? I'm only barely staying in the loop
---
Yeah that's a really good idea, thanks so much for the advice this sounds like a good option for us!
---
I like this idea. Not having a restriction of some kind this time around will be a *very* risky move by blizzard, as unbalanced servers a pretty much guaranteed without. Good thinking.
---
Only detail this doesn't fix is tourists leaving their characters after a week, so technically their characters exist on a certain realm, they just won't be played. But I don't think Blizzard can do anything to prevent this from happening to some realms.
---
I've heard BFA nights might be darker than vanilla nights, but since I quit in WoD I obviously can't confirm that. But nights were dark before CRZ was introduced. I read a blue post a long time ago on the forums (can't find it, it was in Cata or MoP) stating the brighter nights were a bug that was thought to be tied to CRZ, and low priority since it wasn't impacting gameplay. It's also why it was always daytime or sunset in faction capitals, skipping a proper night time entirely.
---
Apparently it was fixed in BFA, and somebody posted screenshots here (and they are linked in another comment) showing that BFA nights are darker than vanilla nights.

Usually people from better guilds run PUGs with a chunk of them on their alts.
---
Later on in the release phases these guilds will run PUGs of Molten Core on their mains for Bindings of the Windseeker for tanks in their guild once they no longer raid MC on main raid nights.
---
That's where you get like 10-15 highly geared players carrying a pack of randoms doing /roll for the rest of the gear.
---
The nice thing is, if you learn your stuff and don't act like an idiot, the same raid leaders who run these over and over again will get to know you and pick you over other randoms.
---
That's one of my favorite parts of the old Vanilla experience, having a reputation and getting to know people in your little server community.
---

---
I havent. Coming in fresh and virginal and i want that experiance i hear constantly. As to where to go and what to look for, im a smart guy, or i at least know how to go north, west, or southeast without following an arrow, thats what im after
---
I think it‘s because it was tedious but on the other side a whole new adventure. I remember running around in it with 4 friends of mine while nobody knew what do to. We stretched the „content“ to like 3 hours because we were running in circles and stuff. Fond memories. Will I enjoy this again? Probably not but these were different times
---
Depends on the PUG. Usually, PUGs are organized by 
---
1) People who aren't in guilds with raid teams 
---
2) Guilds with content on farm that need to fill (not everyone will show up if they don't need anything)
---
3) Guilds with split runs (they have alts, and run raids multiple times per week, but need people to fill for the dudes without alts), 
---
4) Guilds doing gold buy runs for cash
---
You can get the best gear in type 4, but it will cost you gold. The guild won't need many/any of the items, and they'll be put up for bid for the PUG raiders. Type 1 is also good, but usually people are less geared and less organized, so your clear speed will be slow and people will usually need on a lot of loot. 2 and 3 depend on the guild, they should be doing master loot with /roll, in which case you're fine; but some will do weird DKP/GDKP stuff that I personally walk away from.

Yup, that's pretty much it exactly. If you look up quest rewards ahead of time, you can prioritize certain quests, so you can more pieces of have healing-appropriate gear by the time you hit 60. Options can be pretty limited, but you've got the right idea. Leveling as a healer is just significantly more tedious, and with a few pieces of intellect gear, you can heal early/mid level dungeons as Shadow, Feral, Retribution, Enhancement, etc.
---
Probably the goofiest looking class/race combo

Dwarves, beards, beer, guns and snow.

And I believe I'm not alone on this, even if I'm playing as Horde, I gank way less Dwarf players.

Most were consolidated in Cataclysm and then even more were consolidated in Mists of Pandaria and Warlords of Draenor.  They were removed in Legion, but for some funny reason, for Battle for Azeroth, they added Arcane Intellect, Power Word: Fortitude, and Battle Shout back and only those three.

I mean 6-8 hours a week isn't super hardcore. You don't necessarily need every single buff and consumable in every guild; really only guilds on Naxx, competitive progression, or doing timed runs for streams/bragging rights. Most casual guilds aren't that try hard, and can still make it through MC, Ony, BWL, AQ 20, ZG, and even some of AQ40. Naxx requires a lot more effort, but even if you can't do KT you can still do a few bosses in the raid without putting in 20+ hours a week.
---
Huh? 55/45 seems pretty good compared to most servers. What are you even trying to argue?

I played on a certain pserver with  [custom MPQs](https://imgur.com/a/jIdjo)  that added more zone music (mostly from Cata), updated all player/NPC/mob models to their Legion updates, replaced some of the old boxy trees with later models, and even replaced all tiling textures with Legion textures recolored to match vanilla colors. Looked pretty good in my opinion.
---
***THAT SAID*** vanilla wow does  [look pretty good](https://imgur.com/a/MxXqE) . Slap on a reshade profile for some sharpening and color correction and it looks pretty good as well.
---
Called it.
---
How do the pserver players use it?
---
It used to be fairly common tactic for paladins in vanilla. Like that one guy who one-shot Kazzak.
---
The problem with hunters in raids is not just the dps. Sure, its constant dps, but not 'burst'. If a hunter uses the 5 second mana rule and knows how to run the pet (instead of just sicking the pet on the target and letting it die), the dps of the hunter is actually very good. You will not see huge numbers unless you use arcane shot, multi shot, etc at the same time.
---
The problem with them is the pet itself. It does not give dps on the dps meters and therefore people think the dps of the hunter is very low. In fact, a decent geared hunter with the pet is pretty good. Not the best, but is certainly right up there.
---
Now, people with hunter pets do tend to 'forget' to turn the taunt off and other things such as dots and such. This alone would make me not want to bring that hunter along... this happened a LOT in vanilla.
---
Now the reason why dps is 'lower' than other classes such as rogue, warrior, etc (in a raid) is because they are a utility class. They offer a lot more utility than most classes but offset this by not really needing heals.
---
The main reason why they are so 'bad' in late game is due to raid slots and the pet not going on the dps meter. Gear is hard to get if you don't know how to play one...but thats no problem if you pvp ;)
---
To do the line breaks you put 3 dashes (---) inbetween your paragraphs. Be aware that it requires an empty space above to display properly.
---
&gt; By leading towards more PC developers thinking: hey we don't have to design games for the PC at all anymore 
---
Blizzard is already fully aware of the console market, though. They have released Diablo 3 on consoles as mentioned earlier, and have received feedback on that. And the gaming industry as a whole has been leaning towards consoles, and more recently, mobile platforms, for several years already (read: decades in the case of PC vs console). In my opinion, releasing WoW on consoles isn't some revolutionary new development in the gaming industry. Other companies have already done this. Once again, Blizzard has to be aware that this option at least exists, and nothing is going to change that. 
---
&gt;As for your Fallout 3 and NV counter examples, I only see that as confirmation of the idea that games evolve towards simpler console versions.
---
Those games exist in their own little vacuum of Bethesda's own creation though. Bethesda is only a single developer in an ocean of content. Just because they have chosen to dumb-down their games over the years (which imo is not just because they wanted them on consoles), that is their mistake, and if anything, the reactions, reviews, and memes that revolve around the lack of dialogue options in Fallout 4, the trainwreck that is Fallout 76, the lack of depth and in Skyrims quests and dungeons, and the concern over just how simplified the next Elderscrolls game will be, all go to show that negative feedback won't always change a developer's goals.
---
At any rate, look at games like The Witcher 3. That game exists on both PC's and Consoles and maintains its integrity on both as a deep, fleshed out game with just about fantastic everything. So just because a game exists on both console and PC doesn't mean it has to be less than what it could have been if it was exclusive to PC. 
---
&gt; As for the cost differences[...]
---
My addressing of the cost issue was more-so related to the people that can only afford one or the other, or have only ever had a console and have no way of getting a PC. There are also other extenuating circumstances that could prevent people from playing on PC, or simply put, some people may just not like gaming on PC vs console. You aren't wrong that computers have been getting very accessible, but that's somewhat a bit beside the point. Ultimately, I just don't see how giving these people the opportunity to experience WoW could do anything but benefit the community. I just find it hard to believe that all of the fears and worry that those opposed to this claim would come to be specifically and only if WoW were released on consoles.
---
I have absolutely no memory of it, but since the priest was my main, I guess it was a "present" \^\^
---
Lol bro my /played was 20 days before I hit 60 in my first toon no joke
---
I need some help. I'm pretty sure I want to heal, but I can't decide between Priest or Druid, possibly Paladin. (I'll 100% be rolling Alliance)
---
Priest Advantages:
---
* Chance of getting Benediction is very cool
---
* Always desired
---
* Only need to worry about cloth items for gearing
---
Priest Disadvantages:
---
* I will force myself to play a Dwarf for Fear Ward
---
* Shadow is pretty much off the table for PvE content
---
* Probably most popular healer by far; possibly outweighing the additional priest raid slots vs druids
---
Druid Advantages:
---
* Probably not very common so can maybe get into raids easier
---
* Can play as a female Nelf guilt free
---
* Convenience of forms and teleport to Moonglade
---
* Probably (?) more fun in battlegrounds
---
Druid Disadvantages:
---
* Need to carry tons of gear for various tasks
---
* No out-of-combat rez
---
Paladin Advantages
---
* Strongest healer
---
* Free 40 mount, cool 60 mount quest
---
Paladin Disadvantages
---
* Don't get to wear plate very often
---
* Boring AF
---
* Applying blessings
---
Can anyone help me pick this apart, point me towards any misconceptions I might be having etc.
---
In vanilla I played Rogue/Warrior, my cousin who I played with constantly was a Druid, and I was always envious of the Druid community that he was a part of in our guild (I was allowed in our guild's druid class channel and it was great).
---
A big thing for me with Priest is that the idea of getting Benediction/Anathema is really appealing. Maybe people that got it can dispel some of the hype I have around this. How is gold-farming as a priest? What about a druid? Help me sort this out, please!
---
All these Deadmines picks above B tier showing some serious meme bias

That about sums it up.
---
I’d be the Nefarian inside UBRS and watch people fail the Rend gauntlet.
---
that means friends cant play together thou, i dont think thats a good thing.
---
I personally hope that they make new content, something like expansions with only gear progression instead of levels while staying away from all the mistakes they've made through the years and keeping the feel of the game the same.
---
Who wants to play paladin in Vanilla? lol
---
&gt;the worst part of playing alliance is killing taurens, especially their dying animation and sound, it feels you are doing something wrong, i could never handle it.
---
I'm not sure how serious you are about raiding but we only have one druid rostered atm. We plan on raiding 3 nights a week. Pm me if you're interested .
---
Great to see someone get through one of these without mistakes. Only thing I'd change is mentioning greens of shadow wrath as options, or outright bis in a couple slots.
---
I'd recommend people looking at progressing with a shadow priest pick up my (and deathlace's) simulator to help with gearing choices in the future, and between bis points. It is located here: [https://classicwow.live/guides/345/shadow-priest-gear-simulator](https://classicwow.live/guides/345/shadow-priest-gear-simulator)
---
Yeah, I definitely remember doing this as a paladin in vanilla. I can't remember if that was in beta or after release, though. I know that by midway through vanilla it no longer worked.
---
I've never tried twinking, but it does sound like a really fun way to play.  Is there a way to pause xp gain, so things don't slowly level you up if you are farming for specific drops?
---
Mine would be Thief Catcher Thunderbrew get to hear all the stuff going on in if get to watch duels get to best on some horde now and then and with a name like Thunderbrew definitely alot of drink
---
Basically the main reason most of the guild voted Alliance were for the PVE advantages like this.

Go Horde...
---
I am actually excited about this. I don't care for treadmills. I just want to gear my guy good enough to not get destroyed because gear (I want skill to matter most) ... so being able to get geared and stay geared for most my time in Classic is appealing.
---
It would be neat if they did end up named after fan favorite NPCs, places, and items from Classic.
---
Naralex, Awbee, Sulfuras, Thunderfury, Chromie, Gamon, Hogger, Mankrik('s Wife), etc.
---
/u/BelligerentBenny is very correct. I will add that Druid and Paladin healers actually play kind of similarly, especially in T2 if you are speccing into moonglow healing. I do also think that druids have a higher skill floor, but this is a relative concept: all classes in vanilla have super low floors, you get more variance in the skill ceiling (which i think is much higher for druids).
---

FlAt AzErOthErS uNItE
---
12? Which 12 would those be? 
---
Nefarian, onyxia, magmadar (if your guild need fearward here it really sucks) bug family and you could use one on gluth. Which other bosses? There are some trash mobs that fear though.
---
Why wouldn’t friends be able to play with each other?
---
If your friend is Horde, you would go to the same server and make a Horde character. As soon as an alliance character is made you will be able to create your Horde character, keeping it close to 1:1. 
---
If you are unable to create a character that means the server limit has been reached. Which wouldn’t matter, whether or not this system is in place. 
---
And you could not even cap the amount of character on the server, just cap the amount playing at once with a different eye as Blizz does now, I believe.
---
plz forgive ='(
---
Just put the druid ot'ing really.  They do it well enough.  If there's just 1 tank needed ya rarely use a dru is without pummelers.  I'd be surprised if they didn't make those unique but who knows.
---
I never said anything was awkward, that’s all in your head. 
---
Also i dont mind the rant, but I mind your attitude. Which has no time or place anywhere.
---
If you create your characters at the exact same time, one of the two literally needs to wait for 1 more character from the other faction. What about this denies them playing together?
---
so what you just sit there and wait for your turn ? that could take so long if you are not fast enough to create one.
---

Greetings, traveler.
---
It might take a bit to find a guild that works well, but as long as you're social while you're leveling, there's a good chance that you'll have that sorted out before you even hit 60. For casual guilds, seeing everything (i.e. through Naxx) will take a long, long time, but it's doable. You can certainly get into MC/Ony/ZG playing casually.
---
Well they offered it to both factions on Illidan which was an infamously bad idea. Was not a balanced server or even close.
---
Nope you need to plan out efficiently getting all items
---
Can people stop spreading the misconception of vanilla gameplay being slow especially in pvp for once. Vanilla is not only about spamming frostbolt in raids. The sheer amount of gadgets and consummables that are all off gcd makes for a very fast gameplay where you'll disrespect the gcd half of the time. Hop on the henhouse server and see for yourself.
---
I agree that TBC did a lot right with class spec balancing and I think it was a good idea to give both factions Paladins and Shamans.
---
Downsides were flying mounts, resilience, cross-realm BGs.
---
Awesome thanks. I'm considering Holy paladin and i'd prefer to hit 60 before the servers shutdown.
---
You will know your enemy lands like your pocket.
---
this - any and all buffs are helpful in terms of PvP. that's one more dispel / mana the enemy has to use against me in world pvp
---
I don’t think this would take too long as there are so many character being age by people. When the game launches it would be almost instant, and as the server matures it would only take a little longer. 
---
If we reach the point where nobody has made a new character in days or weeks, the game is having much bigger issues.
---
Exactly, what kind of an asshole would kill a Tauren ???!!!
---
I remember getting mad at a PVP video where a hunter kills 2 cute &amp; clueless Taurens druid. I'd punch the guy IRL ! (and I don't play Tauren fwiw).

well how can you be sure you are getting a horde spot ? if this "train" is rolling fast, maybe you get denied again and again. people will just get tired of it and say fuck it, lets go to a normal server and play instead.  
---
The easier solution to balance would just be to lock a faction at 50% of the pop. and keep open/close to balance it.
---
There is no way to pause experience gain out in the world. But thankfully, there is also no xp gains in BG’s and if you really want to farm something, you can get a level 60 to run you through the dungeon so that you gain no xp. 
---
Other than paying out the ass for BoE’s, twinking is really not too labour intensive of a process.
---
What's stopping me from making a character, logging out, and then making a character of the faction I want?

Also the side love of grabbing perfect deviate scales for deviate scale belts for the 19 twinks !

I am very torn between Warrior and Priest. I'm going to roll Horde on a PvP server, but my goal is to raid at 60 and get through end game content. 
---
I was a holy priest back in Vanilla, but I also have been enjoying warrior and would want to try my hand at tanking end game content. Will there be a noticeable difference in demand for holy priest healers vs. warrior tanks in raiding guilds? I want to be able to get gear, and I am concerned that guilds will already have their main tanks established and it will be hard to find a spot.
---
How has no one liked this yet?

Here’s the beauty: you can only make characters on one faction on PVP servers. So you wouldn’t be able to fake your way into this. 
---
You could do this yourself on PVE, but the balance is less important than a PVP server and this would function as a deterrent as opposed to a total prevention.
---
In PvP paladin has a way higher skill cap in a support role than a druid.
---
More than priest....
---
And it would be harder than shaman but the intricacies of where and when to place a totem are constant so it's probably the highest ceiling. But it's also the least effective as enemy skill goes up so not that appealing to play
---
Why do you want to change classic? leave it alone.

true there are many other big issues, but flying is a big issue too.

for example, how impressive is it for a raid group to go kill the various faction leaders when they can just fly over the city and swoop right down to them on a flying mount. versus having to fight through the ENTIRE CITY first just to get to the leader?

---
are we sure about that thou ? They are giving us 1.12. so the quest hubs would be there, i dont think they will tie it to Raid/PVP like pservers do.
---
If it got delayed like that I would hope it would be because they, say, decided to reconstruct an older version of AV, or decided to do an optional graphic remaster like Starcraft and Warcraft 3 got. You know, something they weren't going to do but decided to do. I'd be bummed if it was delayed mostly because they were still squashing some bugs and tuning the lighting.
---
My gaming rig is fried, though, so it's not like I can play Classic until I fix it. A delay would be convenient for me, actually lol. It'd give me more time to decide on a build.

Interesting - I was just looking for this discussion.  I think it would be nice to always have an isolated classic realm/game to visit.  And if they choose to repeat the original progression into BC and WoTLK, those too would be isolated realms/games - not expansions of the existing content (directly).   Essentially three timelines dear to our memories that we can go back to anytime.  Seems a little clunky.  But if they do repeat the expansion process, we'll all just be back here again one day lol.  idk
---
&gt; Warrior tanks aren't purposely letting themselves get crit....lol
---
That's pretty common when farming content that the tank outgears. Get crit, generate rage, generate aggro, dps can go balls out and kill stuff faster.
---
You know that kind of puts me at ease. And thinking of AV is making rouge sound better too. Would be nice to stick it to allis in world PvP too

As a warrior the random buffs were always nice. If I was just traveling and got buffed, I would immediately start killing mobs until it expired. Every bit of advantage to grab quick xp is priceless. When I could I would trade after a buff, even if it was a couple greys they could vendor. Mana pots, I'd always give those away if I had them.

And you think a 1 min CD with 0.5 sec cast that can be resisted by the slow/root you are trying to dispel is worth using for something that can easily be reapplied? At least dwarf racial makes you immune to poisons and bleeds for 8 and you can get a free vanish in some cases.

I don't understand what you mean by 
---
&gt;if this "train" is rolling fast, maybe you get denied again and again.
---
OP said people would get put in a queue. If hundreds of people create their characters at the same time, this queue would only last seconds at max, nobody would get "denied" unless it's server cap. Later on when servers are well established, they could even remove this feature in general imo.

If by experience you mean sigh and consider skipping this quest altogether, then you're on the right track.
---
I can't decide if I want to play a Mage or a Druid.
---
I'm a casual player and don't care about being top of the charts in raids or a high rank in pvp. The pros and cons for me between the two classes are.
---
Pro: Mage - ranged dps, can conjure food/water, can telport/portal
---
pro: Druid - can tank/dps/heal, travel form, not many other druids
---
con: Mage - mana hungry, slower play style, can only dps, popular
---
con: Druid - only two races, forced to heal end game, not many spots in raids for druid
---
It's a classic WoW item, I've no idea as to why you're getting upset at it. 
---
I'm just saying that i'm going to go on an orc killing spree while using it on my warrior.
---
Yea because again if ur a warrior on allaince u should have a paladin with you
---
I mean yea if you're some solo pleb do what you want.
---
But in anything approaching meta alliance pvp escape artist is better unless you're facing a rogue/hunter
---
I recently tanked deadmines on my lvl 36 paladin for fun. Our group had a druid and warlock, and I had specced into improved ret aura after getting conc in the holy tree.
---
So we had improved ret, consecration, thorns, *and fireshield from the warlocks imp*.
---
That was a fun aoe run.
---
I wasn't talking about specifically PvP healing. Druids are garbage healers in PvP.

I use a fancy 12 button mouse. I use themed keybinds to make character swapping easier on muscle memory. Generally my setup is this:
---
1 2 3 - Defensive/utility cooldowns
---
4 5 6 - home row, where my thumb naturally sits. main dps abilities. 4 and 6 would be stuff like MS or eviscerate, 5 is the spam key: frostbolt, sinister strike

7 8 9 - secondary damage abilities: execute, serpent sting, searing pain

0 - = - trinkets/potions/first aid/utility

Q and E are usually off GCD things or an extra nuke button for boring spam fights

R and shift-R are ranged attack/CC

F and shift-F are interrupt and stuns
---
Z and shift-Z are mounts or similar abilities
---
X and shift-X are racial abilities
---
mwheel up and shift-mwheelup are movement abilities like blink, sprint, dash, charge
---
mwheel down and shift-mwheel down are aoes, frost nova, stealth, vanish, feign death

I'll go for the CTRL modifier in addition to what I previously had, that's for sure ;)

Do you ever missclick the scroll up/down while pressing the mid-button? What did you map on those?
---
Then you play on a PVE server
---
PvP server = Roll an alt.
---
Yes, you're gonna get ganked. But if it's too annoying, simply switch to an alt and leave the ganker staring at a corpse while you're leveling elsewhere.
---
Sorry for being honest, but this Warcraft logo looks so bad 'photoshoped' into the background map.
---
I blame "Photoshop CS", not you. By now you're probably a Master-Ninja Photoshop Jedi, right?
---
If you're not concerned about leveling speed, level as whatever spec or playstyle  you have the most fun with; that's what's most important anyway. If you don't like feral cat leveling, play bear or caster instead. Figure out your preferred playstyle, and respec at 60. Outside of raids, the most common kinds of gameplay are PvP (World PvP, Battlegrounds, and Dueling), 5 man dungeons, and solo farming (herbs, ore, mob kills) -- those are all options for bear form.
---
Druids are a class that have a lot of different spec options available and a lot of different ways to specialize depending on your PvP goals and environment. If you want to use bear, healer, or somewhere in between, here are some of your options.

Tbh, I don't recommend pvp servers for people who don't want to place in the time. You will literally have to fight, to even fight for resources.. All the time, God I am looking forward to it
---
&gt;am I missing something?
---
You are. Most of the most interesting stuff will happen on PvP servers so that's where the videos and stories and names that are remembered come from. None of that affects the experience of the other 99.9% of the players who are going to have an amazing time.
---
It’s just the cycle of this subreddit right now. A week ago all everyone talked about was PVE and which classes had chart-topping potential. You don’t have to play on a PvP server if you don’t want to. It’s entirely optional. You are not gonna miss anything if you play PVE.
---
Yeah, that's what I've always done, so you're totally fine.  It really doesn't matter if you're not trying to be some extreme competitive person, although the Move &amp; Steer keybind became invaluable for me since Cataclysm when raiding got a lot harder.
---
A Reddit board is naturally going have a much higher ratio of non-casual players than in reality.  The same thing happens on the FFXIV board; even though the game is basically the "easy WoW," you still get people blowing up the importance or relevance of tiny things that don't matter unless you're taking FF Logs really seriously.
---
And eating the corpse of the guy you just ganked is a nice bonus too :9
---
No it's not lol
---
I could link you my UI on a p server but I won't...THere are addons for that

Lotta trinkets and gear like rocket helms and rocket boots. Plus paladin has 6 auras. Greater and regular blessings and so on....

Plus in combat conumsables need to be bound too

Just practice your starting zone leveling path...with skipping named mobs (sarkoth) or items with long respawn times (kul tiras letter). I aim to just to get ahead of the pack but am by no means hardcore in my grind.
---
They arent THAT bad. I played with a four player team back in vanilla. It was boomkin, Hunter, Rogue, holy pala. The tactic was that we pretty much ignored threat. I (moonkin) held aggro on the kill target while the holy pala tanked the rest while he healed himself. I was the defacto tank in boss fights. It worked up to the serpent boss in BRD. That one just hit to hard for the pala to Keep me up. Then we just switched. He turned on righteous fury and tanked while I healed him and we did it like that on the rest of the bosses.
---
If a holy pala could tank brd with a balance healer I think you are mistaking how bad a prot pala is.
---
Mor'Ladim
---
It would be a blast.
---
You trolling lol. Cant be that stupid lol
---
Azeroth is actually flat. Look at the edge of the map in a dungeon.
---
&gt;Then nobody can make another alliance until a horde character is made. So it just puts you in a short que.
---
Only, it wouldn't be "a short queue".
---
The queue time at release would be 5000 * avg-time-in-char-creation-screen
---
Let's pretend that this process takes 1 minute per player (3-5 minutes are more realistic). So we have 5000 * 60 seconds, that's about **3 and a half days**
---
Three and a half days. And again, that's under the assumption that no one spends more than a minute in character creation...oh, and that the login server (which isn't made to handle long queues) doesn't go up in smoke.
---
So yeah, your post is great...a great example why IT guys like me don't let non IT guys like you anywhere near a mission critical system :P
---
This guy gets it.
---
The threat system and having gear were most important in classic at least that's how I remember it
---
Your gifs are so on point!! 😂
---
We're sure of nothing. I sure whish it was available at release that would allow hunters to get something better than HOJ.
---
You seem to want to have the easiest possible time playing the game. Just pick a mage, you’ll only have to press frostbolt.
---
There will always be room for ppl not wanting to pvp. I honestly believe there are room for everyone. Have you tried a RP server? If not it is in my mind one of the best non pvp experience in the game. I just love in character communication.
---
&gt; I still stand by that this system should have been changed somehow during vanilla's time and hope they will change it somewhat in classic.
---
They won't sadly
---
Anything by Cranius. But Big Blue Dress in particular.
---
I like the way you think. That's the true finishing move
---
Im fucking jealous that youll get to play with your girlfriend. Mine wont even play little big planet
---
What you are suggesting is the same concept. Instead of alternating every one character you would leave the factions open to a number that is half of the server limit. 
---
So if server limit= 5,000, then each faction can make up to 2,500 before they are closed. 
---
I think this way could work, but it would lead to much more frustration and wouldn’t prefer massive inequality until the server is very mature. 
---
The faster the train is rolling the faster your turn will be reached. Remember, this process is only in effect while making a character. After that you won’t see it again.
---
I'm 100% with you on that count. I still mourn the death of the middle market, not least because it was the spawning grounds of most of the beloved franchises currently being run into the ground by the big industry publishers. Indies are great, but it's just not the same.
---
Sadly, there's not really much we can do about it beyond support the good stuff that comes out and hope it becomes successful enough to maybe see something of a return to the way things used to be.
---
Which probably isn't going to happen, but hey, you gotta' have dreams.
---
Dwarf Priest all the way.  I'll be there right with you brother!
---
No, part of the BfA story was Night Elves developing breast cancer and needing a mastectomy.
---
In vanilla this really surprised me. Waking up to myself talking about a quest or a mob. I was having fun playing but until the dreams occurred I hadn't realized how enjoyable it was.
---
Sorry, man. Can't help ya. I'm a Horde hypeman only.

---
Some disparity in factions can be a good thing though. On my server in Vanilla, there were a lot more Allies, but the Horde was dominant at PvP. I played Horde and I actually liked this dynamic. I think a lot of Horde vanilla players liked / took pride in being the minority faction
---
Twinking is fun in part because you're planning your entire gear list (apart from bought items) and need to make sure to explore all the areas youre gonna venture into, before you hit lvl 19.
---
I mean Flurry is amazing. Pretending its bad because you have low crit - we can say similar things about half the arms talents. Death Wish is also amazing. Costs less rage than sweeping and sweeping only does more dmg if you fight multiple mobs, so your argument that ypu take more dmg with DW isnt necessarily true since SS require you to be getting hit by 2+ mobs.
---
Arms is a paim cause you have to respec whenever your weapon type changes. 
---
I still think arms is better for leveling but pretending the difference is so dramatic is stupid. Also your arguments suck. Pretending Flurry, Death Wish, Piercing Howl, are not amazing talents
---
Better cities...your cities won't look like literal piles of manure with sharpened sticks in them.

&gt;As soon as an alliance character is made you will be able to create your Horde character, keeping it close to 1:1.
---
Aaaaand what if the guy who is in queue before me makes a character of the faction that I wanna play?
---
You are obviously not a programmer, and not used to thing in terms of an algorithm. So I will go about this full crayon-mode for you:
---
Your proposed algorithm only allows horde-ally-horde-ally, and so on. THIS IS THE SPECIFICATION YOU GAVE US IN THE OPENING POST. So if we have four players, player 1 can only make a horde, 2 only an ally, 3 only horde, 4 only ally.
---
So what if I wat to play alliance, but I am number 3 in the queue?
---
You didn't think this through for even a femtosecond, didn't you?
---
You can do every Raid as a Casual in a Casual Raid except for AQ40 and Naxx. Which is: 5/7 Raids in the game.
---
You can even run them in Pugs, all of them.
---
I can make you a detailed list of why. But that it's what it comes down to.
---
And if you feel you have enough time for AQ40 and Naxx. Or simply want to see them, because you have full T2 and nothing better to do.
---
You are not married to your Casual Raid, you can leave if you want. 
---
There is a possibility you could even Raid like myself in a Semi-Progress Raid, but you didn't give us a lot of details to work with.
---
Everything has Pros and Cons.
---
This are the factors you need to consider: How many hours do you play, what Class do you play, are you willing to farm for content,  are you willing to learn your class on a decent level and are you going to be annoyed, if everyone else in your Raid doesn't do the same.
---
imp cleave is garbage don't get it ever.
---
Alliance has the advantage with early progression, but horde even out in aq&amp;Naxx. But the horde ony attunement is fucking awful. IM LOOKING AT YOU REXXAR!
---
I always played Alliance in Vanilla through WotLK and I never felt bad about that until now. Well-written, sir.
---
Wear the grudge like a crown
---
I’m in a similar boat as you, Paladin’s have lots of fun buttons but their rotation is really boring, and as you stated, they’re boring, if you won’t enjoy it don’t play it! So lets just rule them out lol.
---
Between your other 2 choices I would say it depends on what you want to do, and who you are as a player.
---
Are you someone who is trying to speed run things, get server firsts? Love to play BGs? Casual player hoping to do it all?
---
I’d say play whatever you want unless you’re a hardcore server first kind of guy, then you might have to put more thought into always being needed or being underrepresented.
---
In PvP Druids are great flag carriers, obviously great sneaky cats, but Priests have mind control, levitate, and bubble for instant saves.
---
Priests can go down quick, so you gotta be prepared against those nasty Rogues ;) AND this is the one thing keeping me from definitely playing a Druid. HOTS can only be applied once per target, meaning, you and another Druid can’t HOT the same person, and the same with multiple Priest renews. There aren’t a lot of other Druids, so that might not matter much, but if you’re a raider that could be a downside to you as a player.
---
I hope this gave any insight at all! xD
---
I currently play on two different RP servers, one for Alliance and one for Horde,  I know we haven't seen a lot of info on servers, but I know that they are talking about RP, specifically RP-PvE servers, not being available at launch.
---
Ok, I chuckled a little bit
---
yes! I 2nd this advice. Best classes for a casual player is #1 Hunter, #2 Warlock, and #3 Druid (in that order).
---
I can see clicking being fine for sparsely used cooldowns, and I've almost always clicked for normal buffs like Mark of the Wild.  But I can't imagine someone clicking rotational stuff and enjoying it.  I don't outright hate someone playing like that; I just don't get it.  Then again, thanks to playing Korean MMORPGs before the original WoW myself, I habitually use the F keys for rotational abilities, so...I'm sure that also would boggle a lot of people's minds, heh.
---
Nice dwarf rogue before the current stoneform meta, did people know that it broke blind back then?
---
Or the guy who made the map thought it was!
---
I don't think it's necessary, assuming we get authentic population caps the chat spam shouldn't be out of control like it is on certain pservers.
---
Additionally as somebody else mentioned, a lot of grouping in vanilla happened because we weren't actively looking for a group or planning to run X instance or do Y quest, but saw people asking in chat and decide screw it and join in anyway. I joined a lot of groups I didn't really plan to join that way before more complex group finder solutions were implemented. People will still join and group up like that if they see you chat spamming, it's just that everybody relies excessively on UI elements now and aren't asking in chat. So all those players who are willing to help out and stuff but weren't actively planning on running that particular content aren't listed/queued, and you aren't asking in chat anymore so you're languishing in queue waiting for  tank when there are 5 tanks in your faction capital that would probably go if asked.
---
I'm doing that with 9 toons on a second account.
---
There are a few Undocumented servers with boosted exp rates and some with insta 60 &amp; pre raid Bis venders that you can test out some end game game play to give you a better idea how each classes play at max.
---
This is the orc way. You must die. At least try to die with some honor on the battlefield. 
---
Honestly I played a nelf Druid on one p server because a friend was set on ally and even when I was 60 with epic gear it felt so meaningless because I was on the alliance and all I could do with it was kill horde. So sad.
---
I really feel like the bad guy on alliance. Horde are just trying to survive and allies are always coming  to kill them.
---
Then you're fucked.
---
It’s the reddit official app, not you.
---
The fact that less than 2% of the people are under 18 is what makes me most excited for classic

---
&gt;First character must be alliance.
---
What if the first guy want's to make a horde character?
---
&gt;nobody can make a horde character until another alliance is made. 
---
And how is your agorithm supposed to know what character I want to make before I go into character creation?
---
No rp-pvp will not be available at launch as it stands now rp-pve should be available
---
Wow, so much for them wanting to keep that 'vanilla' feel.
---
I guess I didn't communicate my thought well, I know i am missing "events", I'm ok with that as I prefer to play solo and experience the story of each zone.  I usually over level in the starting zones so I can not worry about being overwhelmed as I explore my level path on each character.  
---
I was actually asking If I missed some kind of consensus on PvP being inherently better than PvE, or that there were not going to be PvE servers since no one is talking about them, or RP servers.  All the Youtubers are obsessed with either end game raiding or PvP and that just isn't interesting to me.
---
Pretty sure you still gain exp if a 60 runs you through a. Dungeon
---
Just role on a PVE server. Pvp is not the least bit mandatory to enjoy the game and there are plenty of people who used to play on PVE realms. 
---
Most likely the reason you are getting the impression that pvp is basically the entire game, is the players who focused on pvp (myself included) seem to be very prevalent on this sub. There will likely be a healthy split when the game actually comes out.
---
Okay, IT guy. Your number make sense, but you clearly lack understanding of operations and projections. 
---
Why you don’t get projections:
---
Multiple servers as most likely going to be open at launch. They are not instantly going to be ALL CAPPED within the same second causing these massive wait times you are, unrealistically, projecting. 
---
Why you don’t get operations;
---
The system wouldn’t have to wait for a character to be COMPLETELY created! As long as the character creating process is started then somebody could begin the process of creating the opposing faction. 
---
Every time one is opened, the other is opened as well. You could even make a simple algorithm (your an IT guy so I wouldn’t have to spell out: “if A happens then B will...”) to account for cancelled creations to allow the other faction to catch up. 
---
This would lead to near instant character creations,
---
Also, try not to be such a douche if you’re clearly an It guy that takes orders and can’t come up with systems of your own, critical or not :)
---
Someone in Stormwind somewhere because it's still around in BfA, hasn't been the victim of many major attacks, and is still standing. Have a safe, comfortable, death and destruction free job in the big city and have a house in a quiet part of Elwynn Forest somewhere. Sounds good to me!
---
Will be tho
---
0% vers warms my heart
---
So tanks are always fewer in numbers than healers. Even when looking at fights like 4 horsemen which needs 8 tanks, there are still more than 8 healers. 
---
A priest will find a raiding spot far easier than a warrior will, especially a Prot warrior. 
---
Not to say you wont get into groups as a warrior, but most raiding guilds *on average* only need 2 Prot warriors and maybe 2-3 people geared/specced enough to be a an offtank. 
---
I recommend Priest if you are worried about getting into a raiding
---
If your goal is to DPS then definitely mage, but if you wan't to do anything other than ranged DPS then druid is the way. Druids are a blast to level, can fulfill any role, and are an incredibly nuanced and fun class to play in PVP.  Yeah in raids you'll just be healing but you'll also be bringing a lot of utility to your group and you won't have to fight for gear with all the other casters as much
---
You have mounts in your bag?? :D ... And 4000 gold? Damn boi you were rich.
---
Don't worry.  There's plenty of PVE content going on in PVP servers even more so than some PVE servers in my experience.  The danger added when you throw in PvP on top of PvE content is really where it gets interesting.  On a PVE server you all meet up youy 
---
world buff etc and do  the content.  On a PVP servers you all meet up to world buff, fight off the enemy faction trying to interrupt your effort or get a free buff themselves  and fight your way into Blackrock or wherever you are headed that night.  It's great fun and really of you join fairly early there's very little corpse camping and just random skirmishes with the other factions in the world.  Then horror stories of not being able to level after getting ganked repeatedly by max level characters really only happens when content stagnates and people get bored
---
So I think I’ve decided to roll Tauren Druid over Tauren Shammy (still a little torn). I played Paladin in the second to last patch of BC up to Cata first patch. I was a tank in PvE and a Ret Pally in PvP.  
---
I had a Druid alt that I loved so I’d figured to main him this time around. I know the BC-Cata Druid is very different from the classic one so I want to see if I’m gimping myself by going Druid. I  love a hybrid or support class roll, I don’t need to see big numbers but I also want to be able to win some fights 1v1 if I can. 
---
What should I expect, mainly I’ll be into WPvP and bgs after the release? Is heart of the wild my only viable spec for holding my own? I’ve heard Boom is not viable and I know I’ll have to heal in PvE as well which I’m cool with. I enjoy Resto and the HoT focused approach to healing. I also like healing in Bgs but I don’t like to be a heal bot. Would I be better off as Shammy?
---
Soil -halo
---
Dwarf priest seems like a better option to me.
---
Nah prob just not wanting an item to sound like a racial slur in 2019. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Holy priests can easily do the DME lasher farm once it comes out. They shield themselves and then spam holy nova. Here is a video of a priest doing it back in the day on live: https://youtu.be/M3zA1qH02VA
---
Yeah you suck dude get a life
---
That is true, im not sure what is better thou.   
---
If you balance everything off by creating the character, who is to say people are not makeing characters and not leveling them. That would just create imbalance. And it can be forced also.  
---
Instead of balancing the server for the future.
---
There were lot of guilds on PVE servers, such as Nihilum. Back then PVE progression had a lot more attention than PVP activities in the community.
---
Thank you for that, but the idea of big skirmishes happening is just a turn off for me.  I prefer to be able to take my time, experience the story, and be friendly with other people and only go after true evil in the world.
---
I’d go Tauren for Resto, added health and Warstomp ftw!
---
Why do you consider resto druids garbage in pvp? Long casts? Purging HoTs?
---
You're relying on quite a bit of stuff hitting there and the other person to not: trinket and dot/FF, bubble, block, bop, seduce, pet stun, stone form, orc resist, talent resist, free action/living action or a number of other things like set bonuses from the 0.5 (for an example). 
---
Rogues are definitely very good at locking people down but this theoretical best stunlock stuff is just silly.
---
Hi Babyhoof, is there a chance this could stay up since its not precisely picking between classes but rather which is more advantageous to get to 60 with? I did end up deciding on playing both and its more about the synergy between them
---
Mankriks wife. I like the idea of being sought-after by strangers. I also like to play hard to get, true story. Yep.
---
Remy "Two Times" in goldshire.
---
I'll never be lonely, i'll send a lot of new players out on quests, but most rewarding of all - some of those new players are gonna come back to goldshire as heroes @ lvl. 60. I'll recognize them and feel proud of my legacy as a questgiver.
---
&gt;Leveling zones that don't look like they came out of the oven. 
---
Underrated comment right here.
---
Yeah but Crusader procs are baller.
---
If player 3 in the que wants to play alliance the algorithm will account for that on a 1:1 basis for horde. This is probably the simplest problem to address...
---
I’m going to paste my response to your other issue as it seems you just brought up the same invalid points.

This sub: “Ah shit, Here we go again”
---
This subreddit is extremely slanted towards the "hardcore pvp" side (at least the vocal people).
---
PvE servers are called the "Normal" servers. And there were more people on them than on PvP servers (somewhat).
---
Just ignore the noise and roll on a Normal (PvE) server.
---
Game was totally unplayable. 
---
I got on a server with my friends day one. I wasnt able to log back onto that server for like 14 days or something. 
---
So I just went to whatever open server I could get on that day and made a character. I mustve had like 6 characters between 10-20 those first two weeks.
---
Then once they got some stability, I rejoined my friends who were in their early 20s now. Was a shit server, left those alliance noobs behind by BWL release (by that I mean, I had just gotten to 60 the day BWL was released--realized I hated paladin and wanted to pvp. So I swapped to a pvp server rolled horde and didnt play with my RL friends on wow for months...only to realize its hard to get a raid spot as a warrior--so I rerolled priest)
---
If you suck at a tab targeting MMO and can't do basic math
---
You're a dipshit and not gonna convince me or anyone of your competency in any aspect of your life...Assuming you have use of all your fingers.
---
Your grandma could play this game better than the dudes on that podcast lol
---
same here. It was done if necessary or there was a last minute change of plans that required the MT to get other gear from the bank but your average raidmember had to walk. 
---
If classic actually uses the world buff meta however this will change.
---
There's also those spiders with no ranged attacks tightly grouped up in swamp of sorrows around lvl 40-41
---
Simple. Reroll.
---
Warstomp is fantastic for Shamans because otherwise you don't have much real cc. Warstomp then get a huge heal off can save your ass in PvP
---
Hope you have a solo toon picked out, my wife likes WoW, she's played for maybe a year less then when I started in Vanilla right near TBC release and I learned quickly save my main for when I play by my self and level an alt with her because between work and my addiction to WoW, I was always feeling like she was holding me back and slowing me down and I got so annoying at one point she almost quit the game. So I learned to play an Alt that I barely gave a shit if it saw 60 and everything became 1 million times tolerable, I really wish you luck trying to grind out quest items for 3 people and schedule playtime.
---
Yeah you're right, I posted a comment in this thread stating I mixed that one up. The one in the image is the placeholder T0 (dungeon) set. The T1 placeholder was the same as the Shaman armor but green.
---
First character is an example. It can be Alliance or Horde, and it will set off the process in motion to alternate. 
---
Regardless of that, use common sense how long would it take for somebody to make an alliance character on a newly released server? 
---
It could just make you choose your faction first. 
---
These are simple.
---
Kings Honor Friend!
---
Nice to see Classic WoW will be 'politically correct'.
---
There is nothing to be hype about. You used to be a king. Now your are going to spend your days as low life scoundrel. R.I.P.
---
True. Im probably going herbalist aswell, so it would be 3/3 racials in use.
---
I think Deathwing did quite a job on Stormwind in Cata
---
This is fair! 
---
Just comes down to a preference thing. I like 50/50 balance, but if other people don’t that this system isn’t totally necessary.
---
In classic, I played a female dwarf priest and reached Field Marshal. My guild pve'd and I mostly joined those raids to flesh out parts of my gear as I had already gathered everything save the GM weapons. I did get Benediction as well. 
---
I found the fear ward handy in PvP since fear is often used strategically when facing off other priests and it can give you an edge. Especially with the Undead's free fear ward, it can make a level playing field.
---
PvE it was a easier way to get invited being a dwarf priest despite being fully pvp geared out, at least until I built up an alternate set of raiding gear. My bank was very full... oh god the bag space dilemma...
---
Also guaranteed invite to Onyxia raids! I &lt;3 that dragon....
---
In regards to the looks, the females do look doofy. I played on a RP-PVP server so I had fun with it. Gave her a silly backstory where I could really play up the accent and the terrible dance. She was actually quite fun!
---
In your situation, I'd probably try to look for a guild before launch, and try to find one that plans to raid during the times that suit you the best. Then you can just go on the server the guild goes on &amp; live happily ever after.
---
Group up! I remember when the last Ely Sever opened up and I rerolled there I grouped up there and we still had problems. They introduced Dynamic Spawns and with the 325234 players there, it really got out of hand quickly.
---
I have not decided how I wanted to use them on classic as a mage but I played elemental shaman on retail.
---
Scroll up = wind shear ( interupt )
---
Scroll down = purge ( dispell )
---
Scroll click = Hex ( cc )
---
With shift to use those on focus target.
---
For my mage I think Ill go with
---
Up = counterspell
---
Down = decurse(friendly) polymorph(enemy)
---
Click = ?
---
You are right clicking scroll is hard sometimes and might result in misclicking up or down. Hex (cc) there was fine on retail PvE but for classic I will use something else. Scroll clicking is not a good button, but its an extra button.
---
Up and down are underrated and are perfect for interupts and dispells. It kinda "fits" if you think about it. Pushing forworth to interupt and pulling for dispell.
---
[My Rogue.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/dalvengyr/anda)
---
WAIT THERE'S A BLUEPOST???
---
I never played Runescape, and I thought the OSRS idea was a pretty cool one. It could potentially be really cool in Classic.
---
However, as you pointed out, just because it works for one game doesn't mean it will for another for a variety of reasons. It's all well and good to say there's probably little overlap between the classic and bfa fan bases, but bfa isn't where all these change happened. That started in TBC, when a lot of us vanilla players were embracing the changes that came with TBC and Wrath. Oldschool players are just as guilty of advocating changing the vanilla model. I agree that the playerbase as a whole, even if we restricted it to level 60s, just can't be trusted to maintain vanilla mechanics and design.
---
Worth it. Go for it
---
It was changed because the name is similar to an English word for a racial slur and people would use the item link in a racist manner.
---
You couldn’t just make a character to damage that other faction on a PVP server as you can only make character on the same faction. 
---
As imbalance in the future, there is currently no system in place for that.
---
It's 39/61 for EU. But in reality it will be worse since the survey is skewed towards hardcore PS players
---
Yeah I'm so thankful to have her. She's a Nintendo girl but I convinced her to try it when it launches. I don't see her getting nearly as into it as myself, but I can hope.
---
They don't bring a lot of utility to a PvP scenario, only raw healing, which paladins can pump out with greater throughput, quicker cast times, and the safety of plate armor and bubbles. 
---
Vanilla PvP is very bursty by nature, which renders druid HoTs pretty ineffective. Innervate is nice but the cooldown is too long to make a huge difference in a PvP scenario; and any target you battle res will come up with too little hp and just get popped a second time.
---
Druids are decent in PvP, but not as resto. Deep-spec ferals are good at bursting squishy targets and sticking to kitey classes like hunters, and obviously 0/30/21 is the best flagrunner in the game. I've also seen highly geared balance PvPers who basically just meme spec to turn into a 1-and-done MAC cannon that oneshots most things.
---
What chain healing bonus?  
---
3-set gives your totems +10 yards effective range  
---
5-set gives you a 25% chance to regain 35% of the base mana cost of your lesser healing wave and healing wave  
---
8-set makes your healing wave spell jump to 2 more targets, healing them for 20% and 4% of the initial heal.  
---
I do understand the confusion though, as the 8-set bonus basically makes healing wave function like chain heal with up to 3 separate 25% chances of decent mana return. It also procced healing way and ancestral healing.  
---
5x t1 and 3x t2 was also a very popular (VERY popular) and potent setup in vanilla, as it was more of an all-round setup with 3x t2 buffing chain heal and 5x t1 making healing wave more mana efficient.
---
So I’ve decided to roll a troll shaman for classic but having quite the hard time deciding on professions. I’ve tried to read up on google and see what others say but I believe I’m torn between alch/herb or skin/LW. You guys got any advice for me on what to choose?
---
Casual homophobia tolerated because the sub is horde-leaning. Yay!
---
They put in Faction lock in vanilla, and had free transfers. So system was inplace
---
It's my bad, just regular healing bonus with the mana gain back was very good back in the day. I didn't play a shaman myself, I just remembered most of them wearing earthfury while doing later tiers
---
Dwarf priest is the other meta healer.
---
Druid has to FC in WSG or defend a cap in AB
---
Major reason I would pick paladin over priest is because Paladin is a much better solo support. If there is a paladin to make sure you as a priest don't get CC locked you are just as effective as the paladin if not more so.
---
But if you're the lone support and the enemy start blanketing you in soft CC like poly/sleep dust it's GG your team you lose
---
You like bfa? Go play bfa... Simple
---
Feral is the only Viable leveling spec yes. That isn't to say you cant level resto or balance. But you will be killing mobs at a far slower pace.
---
Tanking 5 mans to gear is wise. Just be upfront that you plan on rolling on healing gear. 
---
In WSG, mostly a FG or pure heals if resto.
---
AB, normally defend farm/stables. 
---
AV, well it's AV do whatever you want, like defend or assault towers.
---
in World PvP. You have a greater opener as resto( or any spec that takes Insect swarm). This does assume you get the drop on a person though. Pounce &gt; Rake &gt; Rip &gt; Caster Form &gt; Moonfire &gt; Insect Swarm &gt; This wombo combo will bring a rank 14 geared hunter to ~50% hp on average
---
I like the thought process behind your mapping. Having those movement abilities on mwheel up makes sense to me, I'll give it a go. Mount on Z seems quite decent too.
---
But if everyone is first in stv....
---
I agree that the name shouldn't be changed.
---
But I also feel like you'd be one of the people spamming '[The Nicker] stole my bike' in trade chat.
---
&gt; No way to farm
---
You can aoe farm plants in DM:E in dungeon plate gear with stam/int on it, and do it more efficiently than a priest. You can skin/herb/mine like anyone else.
---
A druid would sort that kind of class. Very versatile, does well at soloing and can do stealth runs of certain instances. Then again a hunter wouldn't be a bad choice!
---
Spell damage is the right answer. My guild had a prot paladin with Quel enchanted with crusader....all I could think was if you're gonna play a meme spec, at least understand how the spec works O_o. Spell damage is your threat, its as simple as that, and remember yeah the coefficients aren't so great, but that spell damage is spread across multiple abilities all going off simultaneously, AND the threat of that damage is getting boosted by RF. MAYBE you could make a case for +agi for an avoidance set, but that's pretty suspect.
---
Hooger, getting raids of female gnomes to "down" me
---
[:&gt;](https://i.imgur.com/igHs4D1.png)
---
Faction lock wouldn’t directly effect balance, as much as it prevents communications with the other faction. 
---
Free transfer don’t prevent imbalance, the attempt to solve it, and not very effectively.
---
My goal for Classic is to just enjoy as much of the content as possible. I’m just not sure if I want the versatility of a Druid in being able to tank, dps, or heal or if I want the utility of a mage in being able to conjure food/water and teleport/portal around the world.

Dude... Alliance has dwarfs
---
Yeah, if you check out the nihilum world first KT video, several of their shamans were still running full t1. The ones that stand out are the two tauren with t3 shoulders, but theres at least an orc and a troll in there as well with 8/8 t1 :p
---
I started at the very end of Vanilla and beginning of BC. Got to 70 in BC raider hard up to WOD and don’t like Battle for Azerite.
---
But I tried a Private server and I’ll have to agree with you, Vanilla is the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. People actually working together, feeling like you’re actually accomplishing something and it not just being handed to you.
---
Interrogator Vishas, because I like people who can't keep a secret.
---
Yeah there are certain levels such as 30 (ww axe) 34 (bonebiter) which have 2h so far ahead of any one hander combos that don’t cost a ton of gold.
---
Although on a fresh they are both pretty hard to get at those levels unless you got friends to carry you
---
What happens after classic?
---
Dude the difference between Mario and wow is that you boot up Mario play through it and then stop. Maybe you come back once a year if you are really into it. MMOs are meant to be continuously  played especially seeing as WoW has a subscription. It may be nice for you to return next year and have nothing change. But the people who play continuously, The loyal customers, will get bored.
---
I cant wait to get myself a 60 and farm enough gold to get myself a twinked 29 rogue again with enchanted WSG rep daggers
---
Name them after all the spells that have been gutted on Live. 
---
* Life Tap

* Mana Burn

I do play BfA, and I do enjoy it.  But I also appreciate the different style of game that Classic will bring and plan to enjoy both.  I'm not sure how liking PvE over PvE means I would not enjoy Classic?  I enjoyed Vanilla when it was out just as much as I do BfA now.
---
I really don’t believe that one of the biggest things you miss about wow is buffing random people.

The BiS is still like half the dps of warrior, rogue, lock or mage
---
I see, lots of things to take into consideration. I'd like to participate in pvp as a healer so this makes the choice a bit easier since I already lean towards paladin. I like the fantasy of being a plate wearing healer in pvp, tossing out blessings, clutch saves, freedoming the warriors and smiting foes. Now I just have to decide upon a race...
---
Both dwarves and humans have their charms. Humans have a little extra dps, but as I understand ret dps is kinda beyond saving anyways, seems like a case of being 11th or 12th on the damage meter. Dwarves have magnificents beards though :)
---
Theyre basically a melee hunter with no CDs
---
You do realise that there will be PvE servers and that plenty of people will be playing that right? I don't see the problem. If you don't want to pvp, you don't have to pvp.
---
rofl, this comment is fucking gold. I've never seen someone be more wrong.
---
The one shot Kazzak meme actually has nothing to do with the /sit controversy. It was a bug that allowed reckoning to stack infinitely.
---
&gt; So, will anyone else be in this category?
---
No I believe it's just you
---
I played a gnome mage too and I was also really jealous of warlocks. Good shout.
---
I love this podcast. Keep up the great work Josh.
---
Spell damage, realistically speaking, You'll probably want to use mageblade as well over an actual tank weapon.
---
BiS I presume
---
You wrote that you like questing and cooperating with other people and would like to do that. You didn't mention anything about why you think there are no quests or you can't form groups in the game. Surely someone making videos about a game will not enumerate every feature a game has to offer, but only what they are most excited about.
---
People talk about pvp a lot because as it was then doesn't exist now. Quests still exist in BfA so no one needs to talk about that.
---
Hey guys! I'm hugely excited about this style of tanking and would love to talk with any of y'all about it. You can reach me in the YouTube comments or right here on Reddit, whichever you prefer.
---
Haha looks awesome
---
Valve has been working on VR stuff and they have a big flagship title to go with their recently announced VR headset &amp; controllers, so who knows? You might actually get your wish

If you already know you like vanilla then what's the problem?
---
" Faction lock wouldn’t directly effect balance, as much as it prevents communications with the other faction."
---
No what is did/do is stop players from making Alliance or Horde characters, on that specific server. And no it did not fix it, it just stopped it from continueing.  What they did was Lock a faction, then free transfers from " Horde to X realm". Full guilds actually changed servers.
---
As to Cross Faction Communications, that was bannable.
---
so true LOL

&gt; If WoD itself was an alternate reality... why would Grom go there in the first place, why would the prince of the black dragon flight send him to an alternate reality?
---
Wrathion wanted an army that could help defeat the Legion. *Garrosh* was the key to that plan. Simply going into the past has the downside of altering the present, but going into an *alternate* past and then sending their army to the original universe? That gets you double the army. Kairozdormu wanted to take that a step further by getting infinite armies from infinite parallel universes but Garrosh screwed all that up by killing him.
---
&gt; It is possible that WoD did create some kind of alternate universe but that means the point at which those two universes diverged was the point where Grom arrived in the past.
---
Not true. The universe they went to was similar but not identical. For one thing, Garrosh Hellscream was never born in it. Kairozdormu did not create an alternate universe, he simply transported to it.
---
RFC, Wailing Caverns, Scarlet Monastery and LB/UBRS are the most memorable for me from Vanilla and thus I’d probably rate them the highest.
---
The reason is that classic isn't out yet. The demo was a demo not the finished product. Since levels were capped at 19 we couldn't test reckoning only redoubt.
---
So while its reasonable to assume that reckoning won't work it's not a 100% guarantee. There also wasn't spell batching in the demo but now we are getting it.
---
It was also a vanilla up until patch 1.8 thing
---
You didn't see it in TBC because knockback spells didn't exist until the 3.0 patch.

It restores 60 energy to your bar similar to thistle tea, it does not increase the maximum energy of your bar. It also doesn't share a cooldown with Thistle Tea.

I primarily played the WotLK expansion as a balance druid, but I am very excited for classic, as I could never get into the game beyond that expansion.  Unfortunately, it appears the balance druid is not viable in classic.  Any suggestions on a similar playstyle?
---
lol me too... the second I saw this meme I went immediately to MMO Champ....
---
I do know that there will be PvE servers.  I found this sub and was excited to see the discussion on Classic WoW.  The technology, the game culture, the story, the memories, etc.  But I felt like PvE only people were either downvoted or excluded from the conversation, and looking at many of the linked videos, and then following recommended links on youtube, made it seem as though the mindset of the classic community was PvP or bust.  I would like to open more conversation and discussion that was positive about non-pvp or non-raiding but needed to see if I was just out of step with the community as a whole.   I am happy to say that this thread has been very welcoming and deeply heartening to be a part of.
---
its an intressting topic, this about realm faction balance, and i hope blizzard has an ace in their sleves. Because 30% vs 70% is not fun for the underdogs trying to do stuff in the open world
---
I recall as well, I hadn't read the patch notes. I was in Goldshire for the first rain, it was beautiful.
---
Yeah part of me is hoping for the album to release then, but part of me also suspects we'll get those two new songs as single releases. Tool is teasing something with iTunes and Spotify, so they're releasing something soonish.
---
&gt;I still remember my two friends and I getting into a rolling hour-long brawl with two higher level Alliance all across the zone 15 years later.
---
Most of my memories of PvP servers are getting jumped by rogues/druids while low on health or ganked by groups or higher level characters, or getting easy kills on lowbies. Very little of the PvP I took part it was in anyway interesting.
---
Druid healers are specialists
---
You flag carry in WSG as a resto druid with a somewhat special gear set
---
And resto is probably optimum for defending a cap in AB...Although i'm not 100% sure there is a meta build for druid cap defender in AB...Sometimes u gotta go try take a cap too
---
If you wanna pvp heal in the conventional i would stay away from them. Very important but don't exactly act as support in organized PvP
---
Actually thunderfury has been changed to legendary pants, called "Thunderpants."

Won't an 20/31/0 build do more dps? Or do you really need Nature's Guidance, totemic focus and mastery that badly?
---
There are tactics you can employ to ensure you won’t level. 
---
Have the level 60 clear all the way to the boss. 
---
Let the boss kill your character. 
---
60 kills the boss and loots. Res and continue. No exp Gained.
---
No changes.
---
You'll see faction balances from 3rd party sites like wow census after launch. Showing a ratio in game would be terrible because no one will want to roll on the smaller faction on a server. Thankfully most pservers I've played are roughly equal. Give or take 10%
---
Druids are actually really good tanks for 5 mans and are arguably better than warriors. I'd recommend druid for sure.
---
Some of my friends who started in MOP discovered Vanilla on pservers and fell in love with it.
---
They aren't playing retail anymore and only waiting for classic.
---
No bro that has to stop once you stop renting, lol
---
The fact that you CAN world PvP is what is excited people, not that you must. In modern wow there is no world, it’s all phasing. Hardly an mmo at that point, more like a loosely sewn together string of lobbies. In classic if you went somewhere and someone else was there... there they were. How you respond when you see these people his up to you.
---
Inb4 you don't actually like the game because of nostalgia.
---
Hi, /u/Readytoworkphoneno

If you've never experienced world pvp in vanilla wow, you're missing out on one of the best experiences in gaming period.

Thanks for all praise guys, will continue to roll out more GIFs 👌🤓

Any character copying all has to happen simultaneously. Being able to copy your character at a different time from when your friend copies his character is rife for exploitation.

---
Can really easily tell who was, and was not a member of their servers community or invested into it.
---
Then I say, both horde and alliance are shattered by the end and WoW is finally put to bed and we can get our rts WC4!

I'm going to need a source on that.

Bad news - he might be too lazy to farm shards
---
Just higher res would be cool and not out of the realm of possibility
---
&gt; All the Youtubers are obsessed with either end game raiding or PvP and that just isn't interesting to me.
---
The majority of players are interested in PvP and end game raiding, but that doesn't mean that you have to be.
---
PvP is even more popular today since a lot of people have done most if not all of the end game content countless times. PvP is a lot more dynamic, has a higher skill ceiling, and has more "replay value."
---
I wanted to see if I was just out of step with the community on how Classic Wow was being approached.  It seemed that non-pvp or non-raiding was being looked down on and that the community as a whole was not supportive of that group.  It may just be, as others have said, a vocal minority, or it could have been a great majority.  You could be on a PvE realm, but it could still be dominated by people that just wanted to do battlegrounds and gave an overall pvp feeling.   I am quite happy that this thread has been so supportive in answering questions about my playstyle not being out of sync with the community.
---
Male or female? A lot rides on this.
---
Love this idea, paying homage to the classic guilds would be cool.
---
I was actually in Retribution on Sargeras up until i quit just before mists launched, came back in Legion and couldn’t find the guild, all my characters had been removed :/
---
I have a Corsair Scimitar, so it looks like 1-9, Shift 1-5, Alt 1-5, Ctl 1-5, Q and E.
---
Q is usually my "escape" skill, E is a skill that procs during combat, 1-9 are base skills, then I group skills as I see fit. The of shift/alt/Ctl groups usually cover my CC, Self Buffs, then various other skills. Works good for me.
---
It's the thought that counts.
---
9? For tons of extra space? Only one would need to be in winterspring  then right? Thats some gaming right there.
---
I was going to try and fit that into the post, but I forgot his username
---
World farming will only be contested if you get stuck leveling with the majority of the population.  If you get out ahead of the bulk of players, Mages will be fine AoE grinding in open world.  But I digress - this is basically a moot argument, we'll see what happens when we finally get in game.
---
Sit to crit is not where you want to be when tanking. Reck is generally a bad tanking skill since your goal is to not get crit so you'll be stacking some +def gear. Not to mention, you didn't block those crits which means you lost the threat from holy shield and Bless of Sanc to gain it from reckoning.
---
I don't feel like this sub is dominated by pvp content. A problem for me is that it's mostly memes and nostalgia here and not so much interesting discussions or theorising, neither of pve or pvp.

---
This is why I won't bother playing vanilla. People like this, which I've personally dealt with often on private servers, are cancer. Always fun playing a spec you enjoy and do your best, when this guy comes along and just talks non-stop shit about you for the simple fact you play a video game differently.
---
Fucking LMaO
---
This is my dilemma too. I think I've eliminated tauren since they cannot ride raptors by getting exalted with the darkspear trolls. 
---
So that leaves trolls or orcs. Probably leaning orcs but I'm not too sure
---
Oh yeah I've learned to proof read at least twice before I post. Any mistake is on purpose for the lol affect.
---
Nah, from tbc on (I think it was then that they added it) you could left click to add a point or right click to remove a point, then confirm at the end to apply the build.
---
There is no real source, other than the fact that no one knows what the exact armor values of most NPCs are or how armor reduction debuffs stack in exact math terms. So Private servers have been developed with a "best guess" approximation based on video evidence and trying to work the damage math backwards assuming that armor value reduction stacks additively. Effectively, it's an inexact science and some servers are anecdotally "undertuned" while others are "overtuned".
---
I don't understand how someone can not have Stratholm as S tier. You destroy Ziggurats, get trapped and attacked by deadly roaches, before the last boss you need to kill a wave of undead rushing at you and the final boss drops the best mount in Vanilla WOW.
---
Carrot on a Stick!
---
I don't even think flying was specifically a problem. There was plenty of world PvP still in TBC at dungeon entrances, farming spots, and daily zones. I think the real problem retail has is things like teleporting into dungeons, making farming irrelevant, and cross server stuff.
---
Very true, I also hope they’ve got something cookin’.
---
Alliance has access to the Duskwood zone, which aesthetically has one one of the best told stories, aesthetics, and motifs in the entire game. Also Dwarves are pretty cool.
---
Better chance at getting Aurastone. It's more of a pvp toy for the healers, and as a prot the mp5 is actually worthwhile. Plus if any guild gave mageblade to a prot pally when the casters still needed it you'd see a flurry of /gquits.
---
Tried looking for that option in the reddit app, but it doesn't exist. :(
---
Just because they add new content after Naxx doesn't mean all the content they add has to be harder than Naxx.
---
The solution is to LET THE TRANSFERS FLOWWWWWWWWW
---
I personally hope there are 2x as many horde as alliance on my server
---
Past leveling only good things come from more enemies around.
---
I would be one of those patrons in BRD, upstairs getting drunk at the tables. It always seemed like endless entertainment, plus you'd see some shit. If I remember correctly, there was that secret (?) boss that was activated after you get him drunk.
---
Zoom out to outland or azeroth and it seems like a planet to me. Plus that time Sargeras pulled the reverse sword in the stone and fucking stabbed the planet
---
A possible idea to fund your respecs without  changing a game mechanic is GDKP runs with your guild once your raid is geared and starting possibly as soon as you have MC on farm, or even doing it with 5-mans. Carry people, they pay gold for gear. Gold earned is distributed among the guild members that attended, and/or used to fund guild members' consumables. Either way, you could have your cake and eat it too.
---
When is this server launching? Should put that info in the sidebar....it's the reason people are coming here but the information is nowhere.
---
But i guess vanilla no one really knows
---
Thankfully, it's very unlikely classic will use the world buff meta. Onyxia's head has a significant cooldown in Vanilla, unlike what happens on pservers.
---
Also, what buffs do a full heirloom lowbee really need or appreciate?
---
That sounds very abusable. 
---
How does it work?
---
Can i get myself into a position where I'm respeccing in the middle of a BG? lol
---
+1 for Nobbel. Excellent lore channel for classic and beyond
---
I'd be Myra Tyrngaarde, the bread vendor in Ironforge.  
---
She gets to hang out with heros all day, live in the best city in Azeroth, and do what she loves (bake).  
---
Also she's a [total hottie](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=5109/myra-tyrngaarde#screenshots:id=447596).
---
I don't understand how someone can not have Stratholm as S tier.  On the undead side you destroy Ziggurats, get trapped and attacked by deadly roaches, before the last boss you need to kill a wave of undead rushing at you and the final boss drops the best mount in Vanilla WOW.
---
You're getting confused. There is a lot of PvE content to do and you can select a Normal server (PvE) where you have to flag to enable wPvP. You do not have to participate in PvP at all to enjoy Classic.
---
What you're reading about is changes made to the game that reduced the amount of world PvP that happened, thus making PvP realms less unique. Sharding, flying mounts, and dungeon queues, all reduce the amount of times you come across other players in the world. Coming across other players, specifically the opposing faction, is important for wPvP servers, as it is what causes confrontation.
---
If confrontation isn't your style, none of this is a concern to you. Play on a PvE server and never flag for PvP. However, changes made to the game need to keep both communities in mind.
---
From personal experience i would say alch herb.
---
Herbing is a great way to make money since resto shamans arent very good at killing mobs. Alch is cheap to level up and easy to get a bit of extra cash from buying mats on AH and selling the potions for profit.
---
There is no consensus on this so you can choose whatever fits your play style / needs best. 
---
You are correct with 30 spell power adding very little damage to consecration. I would not recommend this for dungeon tanking it's more used for paladins who are trying to push to the limit and tank raid bosses for fun. 
---
You can't go wrong with crusader, the heal is nice and the strength bonus gives you not only a white dmg increase but a mitigation increase too for the duration of the buff thanks to strength increasing the amount blocked.
---
Lifesteal procs a lot with seal of righteousness and boosts threat plus heals you and is imo the best enchant for aoe farming which you will probably being doing a good bit of.
---
- 1 bank alt in IF
---
- 9 alts camping 9 vendors
---
And since it's a second account, I can switch them out any time I've got a few seconds available without impacting my main's performance. And since I'm a pally, I've got plenty of idle time while leveling. Should be able to check each one 2-3 times an hour.
---
they are thumbs
---
The reason people put up with that shit on live servers is because tomorrow could bring the patch that fixes your spec/build
---
There is no excuse for that on a patch that's 13 years old lol
---
Exactly, you're an assassin, you're supposed to take out a vulnerable high-value target and get out. Not skirmish with people in the open. At best, stunlock, CC, slow and let your warriors and other big hitters fuck shit up more easily. Or be stealthy and go cap unguarded flags, etc. I used to snake flags in AB from solo defenders all the time. Either capping while they're sapped/blinded then preventing the recap until my backup arrives, or killing them real fast and capping.
---
The XP buffs those heirlooms give lmao

I’m not sure what you’re trying to say here.

I have played Vanilla and TBC unlike you, so I know I enjoyed rogue in vanilla a lot more :)

Its “iconic” to few (or specific types) and for very obvious reasons; also why it makes perfect sense to rename.
---
Nah it worked a lot, even with DRs you could pretty easily kill people before they could press a button.
---
For sure. Or all of the people asking whats going to happen after Naxx. When I'm refreshing and see something new pop up then realize its that shit it actually irriates me lol.

Hanzel und Gretyl - Fuken Uber Death Party

dragon force -  fire through the flames
---
This is the kind of response I needed. That is a pretty brilliant tactic. Lot's of work but worth it to farm all the BiS.
---
So you want them to add Draenei but only the introduction of their story?
---
I think the reason we'll see at least TBC and Wrath servers are because Vanilla through Wrath was WoW's most successful time period. Wrath is when it really started to steer toward modern convenience and design, but it seriously took off with no turning back in Cata and I can't help but notice that's when subs started dropping off quicker, and in greater numbers.
---
The first three expansions were a sweet spot for what is in my opinion a very viable, even large market that the modern game left behind. Cata+ started to focus more on transient players that sub, consume content, then unsub until the next patch. Before that the game was more tailored to the long haul players, casual or not, who were willing and interested in more drawn out content with delayed gratification. It's just a different demographic, and if pservers are anything to go by, still a viable market.
---
Sounds like you know your shit aha. Only thing I can think of is the raw gold required to buy em. Though I imagine you have that all mathed out already.
---
Be prepared to play alts. Most of the time you'll see someone from the opposite faction and they will run past you, maybe even wave, because after a few weeks everyone is tired of fighting constantly and they just want to level. You will occasionally run into someone who wants to fight, ok, not a big deal. However, even more rarely, you will run into those assholes who claim corpse camping isn't harrassment and block your ability to play the game. In those cases, you can report them if you want, and go play an alt. Most of the time, you will be outnumbered, they kill you for fun, and keep going, so you just get a corpse run out of it. Fine...
---
DO NOT COME HERE COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMEONE CAMPING YOU. My god we will see so many posts about griefing. Unique and extreme cases, ok we can talk about it, but I'll be ready to downvote all those threads because there are a few things you can do instead of complaining on reddit. Play an alt and report if you want to. There is also the true PVP option. Get your guild to help you or group up, but often that will result in larger fights that can drag on and lead to fun times or bad times. Do this if you want to keep fighting. I usually just play an alt if there aren't friends nearby.
---
TL;DR After those first few encounters, everyone is sick of fighting all the time so you won't have to worry about it. Only the occasional a-hole will force you to log off or play an alt.
---
5k health is like pissing on a house fire at aq+.
---
Rogues have a lot of health compared to most classes (except Warrior, Druid and Paladin), and it's VERY hard to get 5k unbuffed with even Tier 3 gear.
---
So, every class in the entire game is pissing on a house fire since they all get 1-shotten in PvP. Warriors, Druids and Paladins get 2-shotted ofc.
---
THat's how Vanilla works ;)
---
Maybe spread it out a bit though jees. We need the memes to last untill release.
---
I have fond memories of SM, because it's what I used to farm out my mount.
---
Could you please explain this? I don't understand the purpose of camping vendors. What does that mean?
---
Did you get 1-2 shotted and died in an instant in PvP all the time?
---
In all serious, can you remember what you did to make G? :)
---
Enjoy paying to play the exact same experience you have had on private servers then :) you're still cancer though
---
What do you mean camping vendors for recipes? Is this some gold-making meta?
---
Doable? Easily. But I don't think it's a good idea, because you don't actually want everyone flocking to the most balanced server. Assuming that players choose their server more or less at random, all servers theoretically normalise over time. If you display faction ratio, those servers are more likely to be avoided, and thus the ratio will stay bad more or less forever.
---
This deserves way more likes. I hope you've posted it on the other wow subreddits also
---
For some reason even though i had played fps games prior to WoW and even though I tried I could never get used to WASD movement.. wondering if anyone else here had that experience.

I know this is unrelated to WoW, but these colors 🇺🇸don’t run, so I gotta tell it like it is.

You're playing wrong. You don't frontline as a Rogue. You pick clothies off and help your warriors stay on a target with CCs.
---
Once at lvl 55 on my arms warrior I killed a 60 shaman who tried to gank me. He then ahnked to try and finish me off, but I killed him again.
---
As shaman was widely considered op at the time, not a single person believed me. It would’ve probably been about the same as convincing people I used to be r14 but censored all my gear. 
---
I guess that makes it one of my greatest wow achievements?
---
You simply cannot use storm strike in a raid which is a good portion of his dps so this whole video is pointless
---
No.  I want them to do nothing.  Keep vanilla vanilla, never release TBC, and merge servers if they're dying.
---
Honestly the biggest point is not clicking your abilities.
---
Mage, Warlock, Shadow Priest, and Elemental Shaman are all potential options. What are your goals in WoW, dungeons, raiding, battlegrounds, world PvP, etc.? That will help narrow down your search for classes. Mages and Warlocks have the most options in PvE and PvP while Shadow Priests, Elemental Shaman, and Balance Druids have less flexibility. Out of the hybrids, Shadow Priests probably have the most opportunities. Which aspects of Balance Druids do you find appealing? That'll make it easier to narrow things down for you.
---
I'l have 20 ping 
---
It's gonna be real different
---
A night elf in that stupid cave quest that takes an hour to do and has like 3 levels of bridges and furbolgs

Yeah, just park an alt at any one of the vendors that sells important recipes. Sell it later for profit. 
---
Honestly I get the feeling people are well-aware of it and it won't be free gold, but its something to consider.

Re-render. No. They already have a high resolution one available. You just didn't see it back in the day because of they heavy compression to put it on disc. That said, if they wanted to do it I'm sure whatever computers they have now could probably spit out a 4K render in under a day.
---
there is a 82% chance you are correct.
---
ive never really tried a warrior. what im worried about is being close range damage with no heals. I feel like im going to do a lot of dying over and over again (compared to a paladin who has heals).
---
Shaman aren't the best skinners, and by association leatherworkers, due to their relatively slow kill speed. You either need to kill fast to grind tons of leather, or have the ability to solo elites for rare mats like dragon scales. Shaman are capable of this, but it can be slow going and requires better gear, where somebody like a lvl 60 hunter can farm like a machine as soon as they hit 60.
---
Herb/alch otoh is an all around amazing profession for any spec you choose to go with. You won't make the amazing amount of money you could if you were server-first with some rare pattern, but herb/alch provides a nice steady stream of cash and lets you farm up your own raid mats.
---
#NoChanges
---
I think subs over time would be a good indicator which expansions have a viable long-term market and which don't. The ones that sloughed off subs (including token time) at higher rates probably aren't viable. The ones that were slower to hemorrhage players might be worth considering. Which is why I think we will likely only see vanilla thru wrath if we see more than vanilla at all.
---
They don't *have* to create Cata+ servers, but if there's a viable market for any given game version there's also no reason not to.
---
A bigger concern in my opinion is how much it could split up the playerbase. There's a point where there is little overlap between the vanilla/tbc/wrath crowd and those who prefer later expansions, possibly going back as far as Cata.
---
Are you trying to Taunt me? Because you can't.
---
Nice reference! Now we just someone to record a cover using WoW names and events.
---
Thanks fren
---
Alternatively, compared to a PoM mage or geared Ele shaman, its nothing exception and requires you not only get the jump on the target, but also are in melee range and very susceptible to getting nuked by anyone else in the BG.
---
Lol no, just no. You don't seem to get the point of this game. It's not supposed to be the retail easy-peasy these changes make the game more manageable in a modern setting. Classic wow is taking the game that released in 2004 and re-releasing it as best as they can re-create on 2019.
---
If you want to be a hero fighting bad guys....fight the opposite faction?
---
They are the ones taking world boss spawns, picking your black lotus, ganking your lowbies making them quit before hitting 60. 
---
Or go play a pve server where they can still snake your world bosses and take all the ore/herb/devilsaur nodes, yet you cant do anything about it.
---
If you have experience in older PC games you will be fine
---
Holy or nothing
---
I feel you.
---
Troll has the worst racials for shaman, specially in PvP.
---
But dude, they look sooooooooo amazing in shaman gear, specially with the Zulian Defender
---
I always find it funny that a lot of casuals say they don't have time to raid.  They don't realize a full clear of Molten Core (MC) often takes LESS time then trying to clear scholo with a bad pug.
---
40 skilled raiders can clear the entire MC when they have it on farm in about 2 to 3 hours.  Thats all done within one night, then they move onto Blackwing Lair (BWL) the next night.
---
I've been stuck in terrible pugs that take more than 3 hours to do a full clear of places like scholo.  Again, these are the same people that say they can't raid.
---
When you realize how much time you are actually in the game, you then quickly realize its better to join other skilled players for basically anything in the game.
---
Precisely. Thanks for understanding boyo. Some people took it the wrong way :&lt;
---
The best class for dme lashers is a paladin and it's not even close. In pre-bis specced 25/26 you can do a run in 4 minutes killing 2 packs at a time and not eating or drinking.

Given that classic isn't out yet, not sure where the proof came from...
---
And if you don't roll all crits, the shaman gets a free kill!
---
lel
---
You could say that for literally any weapon.
---
That's a horrid argument.
---
Certain vendors have limited stock on items.
---
For example: [Recipe: Frost Oil](http://classicdb.ch/?item=14634) is sold by Bro'kin in Alterac Mountains.
---
He has 1 recipe. If someone buys it, it's gone for ~90 minutes and nobody else can buy it. Some recipes, items, etc restock in 15 minutes, some in 4, 6+ hours.
---
The rarity makes them valuable. If I get a level 1 bank alt with 10 gold camped out in a 50+ level zone early... I'll have that vendor to myself for 100 hours.
---
Haha this is really high quality! On point!

The only thing that is correct about your post is that dwarf female cast animation looks amazing.
---
Fear ward isn't needed, nor "needed" for hasty clears. If you need fear ward for clean clear on trash, your guild is trash. It is useful on a few handful bosses, but not needed.
---
to OP: If you play a healer, doesn't suck and show up, you will get to raid. Sure, if you want to min-max, dwarf is prob the best option. But it wont make or break your raid life unless you only want to get into a hardcore guild (and probably not even then).

This is an assumption but I’m guessing most vanilla players used addons for management purposes...so is that not modifying it? I played the game for almost 2 years without addons.  I constantly see videos of vanilla players using addons..so yeah I’m confused about the no changes, no changes responses yet..addons are not pure vanilla as it was intended. So enlighten all of us who don’t understand this “pure” vanilla most of you speak of.
---
Nothing wrong with wanting to tank instances as a pally. We're seriously hard up for instance tanks, and if we're not going to get fixed specs a la TBC then we can at least enjoy the niche abilities of the shit-specs. Just so long as people know what they're getting themselves into it can be fun. I'm halfway tempted to run an enchantment shaman tank for the hell of it.
---
Deleting would not have any effect on this system.
---
The only addon I need for healing is Grid. Some ppl use Clique. I've always keps low on addons in my healing and done well, so I'll stick to that.

Druid seems like the one that I would enjoy the most. I’ll have to look at how good it is if I do decide to do any raiding

Warlock appeals to me for the DoT aspect so I would probably like affliction, I’ll have to see if that’s good
---
I started  just before wotlk launched. Looking forward to give classic a go and see how it is. Will be playing a warlock which will be new to me as I usually main melee. I think my first ever character was a warlock called omegadelta lol :( literally had no idea what I was doing and only reached level 42.

They have said they are using the 1.12 world and items added later will exist when they were added.
---
That certainly breeds some ambiguity. That said, all their comments have been in regards to loot from dungeons. But if you follow their logic regarding items changing stats, it would stand to reason the same logical thread holds when discussing the leveling process--no one wants to have to remember a quest doesnt exist until some arbitrary time.
---
So while we aren't sure, to me it would see the quests that were in the game in 1.12 will exist from phase 1 onwards. That said, theyve alreayd mentioned some raid related quests wont be added until its time, like ZG island, Cenarion Hold stuff, Naxx quests.
---
If I had to guess, I'd guess rune is in.
---
I didn't see the other post... was it written by someone who is working for Blizzard and able to play classic right now?
---
OBS is free. you can stream it or record. streaming it would probably be easier since it wont use up hdd space.

No. Changes.

---
Really depends on the server. Some are so contested it's not possible (happened on p server)
---
So then you are faction locked as soon as you select the server?
---
I'm not perfectly sure to be honest, but I think dual speccs would be nice. You all know, it is a PITA for tanks and healers to farm stuff etc. Respecc costs a lot of gold and isn't really worth it. When dual specc was introduced it did cost 1000g, if I remember correctly. This would be a good way: you don't get respeccs for free, but you are much more flexible.
---
It's not an every time event.  It's the chance of it occurring that adds the flavor for me.   If you want no danger and to just be able to do your own thing whether in group or not than a PvE server is the place for you.  I personally recommend having at least one toon maxed on a PVP server so you can understand our angle but if it's not for you it's not for you.  That's why the different servers exist.
---
Sadly version 1.12 is already a lot easier than the earlier versions
---
It has some heavy nerfs to the 5 Player instances, molten core and onyxia
---
I always roll on the smaller fraction. Faster pvp ques.
---
I'm glad private servers exist to give players like you that first taste.  It sounds like you discovered the same things those of us who were around for Classic also miss about the game.  This release is going to be something special.  Players like you, waiting to legitimately experience it for the first time, and like me, who were around for the original and eagerly await this rare opportunity to relive the launch with veterans and newcomers alike.  I look forward to welcoming you and others like you.
---
Fair enough. After all the community has a big effect. I'm going to go to a rp server this time instead of rp-pvp. It could have a lot in common with what you seek with pve and coop, so I recommend giving rp servers a try. Hope to see you there!
---
Okay so you completely misunderstood everything I said, which is pretty impressive considering how clearly it's stated. No shit you learn plate at 40, I'm talking about sub 24 which is why late is irrelevant.
---
Secondly I said more autos. Your first 2 dodge/parry, then you miss 1-2 more, that's 3-4 dodge/parry/miss. Which will kill a warrior 95% of the time against an orange mob. And 75%of the time against even or +1 level mobs.
---
Lastly if you can't tell instantly is a hyperbole you need to learn basic English conversation. You don't literally die instantly from a miss. It does however set the ball in motion and you will die from missing 4 times in a row, sub 24, more often then you survive.
---
as dicky as this sounds I'm actually in the same boat. Several friends and my SO would always get drained after a couple hours and me being a huge nerd would power on through. I Had my gf say she wanted to quit a couple times because I'd nag her to continue playing etc. I'm much less of a turd now or least I like to think that's true.
---
Don’t let this fool you into thinking Shadow is raid viable.
---
Amazing in PvP though!
---
(I just like to set proper expectations.)
---
You are faction locked when you make your first character on that server. Deleting you characters would remove the faction lock. But, it would not effect the que of people that are able to make horde or alliance characters at a time.
---
Certain people tend to run certain pugs at certain times, you'll likely see something like "LFM Bill's MC Pug"
---
This post needs pinned.
---
You're the one who told me to type that into YouTube
---
it looks like mongoose on that ripper
---
You ok?
---
I don't have a very strong preference for change/nochanges in a lot of areas, though my preference does largely lean slightly more to nochanges. I just want the gameplay balance and mechanics intact.
---
1. Some of us in another thread pointed out the issue with adding a more robust dungeon finder to vanilla. In vanilla (heck probably still in the modern game) a lot of us would be doing stuff without planning on running X content, but we'd see somebody in chat LFG/LFM for X content and say screw it and run it anyway. In the modern game (or at least as of WoD when I quit) people relied excessively on the LFG/LFD interface. If you spammed in chat you'd probably still get bites, speeding up your group formation, but people didn't do that because--again--they relied excessively on a UI element, limiting their reach somewhat. I don't think this is a positive change for vanilla, or even the game in general. I wouldn't quit, and I'd probably use it, but I'd rather not see it.
---
2. There are a lot of UI updates over the years personally would like to see rolled into the default UI. The default UI has always been at best sub-par, poorly laid out, with information showing up when it isn't needed, in the wrong place, in an ugly and clunky manner, or not displayed intuitively at all. The stock UI could at least use some SWTOR-like UI editor. I get that addons can do all of this, I've just always been a little irked that utterly basic UI functionality isn't part of the stock UI.
---
3. No, absolutely not. Many buffs required reagents, and it took time to cast them. Since a great deal of us love the slower, drawn out, grindy pacing of vanilla (yes, we actually do enjoy that kind of gameplay), I don't think it's a good addition to the game to vastly speed up and simplify these systems. Part of what makes vanilla work is the time it takes to do a lot of things. Part of the zerg rush that is the modern game started by simplifying too many things.
---
4. I honestly don't have a problem with a built in quest tracker (which vanilla already had) and adding indicators to the minimap. I'm not convinced, as others seem to be, that seeing a random ? in the middle of nowhere somehow nerfs the leveling experience. I'm also not averse to putting locations on the map of quest mobs/nodes/etc while tracking an active quest, because again I'm just not convinced that it nerfs leveling in any meaningful capacity. Again, I'd rather see it left out, because going in blind was part of the vanilla experience and I would like newcomers to experience the same game I enjoyed. I just don't think it's game breaking.

Horde | ⚔ NA-PvP ⚔ | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
Wherever the big streamers go the servers will be hyper unbalanced towards that faction.
---
It’s often a lot worse than that. 55/45 is 10 on the ratio but 22% player diff. People call that balanced for god knows why reasons.
---
Hemit Nesingwary.   
---
Watching the slaughter unfold while pretending to be oblivious.
---
"Anal"
---
Sure you can off spec tank any 5/10 man but the spec is gimped, no taunt, mana issues, hard to gear properly.
---
I have heard people claim that one faction or another is superior, often favouring paladin, but I have never heard an explanation as to why. Is it just that paladins are more efficient healers than Shaman in raids?
---
Makes sense, thank you. So it's possible to run an alt there and survive the run? Are there mailboxes at these locations you choose, so that you can send items to/from the alts, or is the idea you just stock up on these items and once you have spent all the gold, you hearth the alt back to the nearest main city?
---
Shadow is absolutley viable for raids. Not on a large scale no, but it absolutley has its benefits to bring one. Nor did i ever make the case that it was optimal. But if you make friends bring consumes etc. Youll have a spot. Also farm your pre bis healing gear. Some fights you can throw it on and help heal etc. Be useful
---
&gt; so yeah I’m confused about the no changes
---
We want Classic to be as close as possible to an authentic historical recreation of Vanilla. Addons was a core feature of Vanilla. Custom Ui changes was not.
---
Andrew
---
Ugh, I'll see if I can find it or something related. Have to go to work now
---
I think this is great in theory, but would lead to a low overall population as players can't freely choose what to play.
---
lock the faction once it hits 60/40.
---
Wtf
---
As far as I'm concerned, the current version of wow is an absolute nightmare for new players. I don't understand how you're supposed to know what to do or how to do any of it unless you've been playing the whole time.
---
Classic is an actual MMORPG. You will be naturally guided by the game into what you're supposed to do and how to do it, but also be required to make many decisions about your character and how you progress.
---
My opinion is, cancel your subscription, delete your characters, and wait for classic.
---
Wow dreams are nice until you're in the stage where you have been up playing for 3 days and then think you will get a solid 12 hour sleep but you wake up sweating and with a racing heart after 1 hour in bed because you got ganked in your dream, and then forced to go on playing because you can't stop thinking about what is happening on the server
---
Lol "Fine here are some crappy blur posts"
---
??
---
That’s bait
---
It takes longer to get to 60 in classic than it takes to get to 120 in current wow.
---
Ah yeah I posted this before I noticed your other comment! Good work on the image though, brings back many memories of our first clears of MC
---
Thank you!  I will mostly be focused on PvE - raiding and dungeons.  I just loved all the unique spells which made the gameplay varied and exciting.  Eclipse procs on single target dps was fun; using hurricane, typhoon, and starfall for incredible aoe potential was fun.  I loved the treants that could run crazy.  Of course healing myself was nice as well, but really it was just all the different ways to play the class that kept me coming back.  I've thought about Mage but I worry I'd get to 60 and then just be bored of constantly spamming frostbolt.
---
Thanks for the reply, that sounds about in line with my expectations. Now I have to weigh raiding in a guild vs. being able to tank for my irl friend group if nobody else wants to roll a warrior...
---
I miss playing my 39 think Warlock named Hashbrowns.  So much fun running WSG in those days...gah I want to go back so bad!
---
Sorry, it’s not.
---
Run’s into the same problems that Ele and Balance does. Mana.
---
If you are going to throw “Shadow Weaving” into the argument....you should just be a healer that applies Shadow Weaving.
---
You think you do, but you don’t
---
What I don’t get about ret/prot is that you punish yourself more than others. It’s so god damn boring to play, I mean it’s much more fun gearing/consume-stacking a warrior for aoe tanking.
---
Yep, I actually just found that. Someone asked if it would be in this build. If it's a 1.12 build then no but I have to look for a post I saw that went into detail regarding it
---
Well, do you?
---
Some have mailboxes nearby. Some are out in the wild. I'd definitely send more gold to the far ones, let them camp there until they're out of gold. Hearth to nearest inn, mail items to Bank alt, get new money, head back out. 15-20 minute reset.
---
i don't know a single girl that plays wow around my area xD
---
You have to play smart to not die a ton while solo leveling a warrior.
---
Addons are UI changes..just not provided by Blizzard. That’s why they give you the toggle option for this in Interface options...smh.
---
How true is this tho
---
Minor quibble, but it's actually the 2006 version, which is notably different from the 2004 release.
---
I think your confusing viable with optimal. We are im agreement here i think
---
I think they can still freely choose what to play. They just must wait a tiny amount of time in a short que. other than that they can still pick their own faction or server just as before. 
---
Btw, I don’t know if I was included, but the faction lock would operate the same way it has always worked in vanilla.
---
Undead male rogues especially. I'll for sure prioritize my group, my exp and that jazz, but it all goes out the window if I spot an undead male rogue, it's not even a question; I'm attacking him.
---
No, horde is gay
---
Hmm. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I suppose.
---
Who’s Drew?
---
From Pittsburgh, I'm guessing?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
I'm glad you had the courage to post this brave and controversially statement. It definitely hasn't been posted numerous times, in the same format, with lack of creativity before.
---
Also possible. But once the faction is locked in this fashion it might be a bigger chunk of time. 
---
So the way I proposed takes the time you cannot make a character and distributes it to a whole bunch of people trying to make characters so they only need to wait a short period of time. 
---
If a faction is locked in your proposed method, it could move that burden of waiting time to a small number, maybe even one player, ruining their experience.
---
For a warrior.. should i go human for racials and weapon expertise or Nelf becouse í like them better

[EU - PvP - Alliance/Horde]
---
Hello, i’m 27 years old Swedish guy
---
looking for semi hardcore / hardcore guild.
---
With my work schedule i happen to have a lot of free time during the week days so i would prefer a morning/daytime raiding guild if one even exist? Otherwise i guess i will have to seek the wifes approval of raiding in the evenings, haha!
---
Vanilla PvE Experience: 
---
Progressed to Princess Huhuran in AQ40 and tried spider wing in Naxx before Burning crusade. I was one of the tanks in Guild of Honor, Darksorrow EU. 
---
Vanilla PvP Experience: 
---
Made it to rank10 without really trying to hard. I was more into PvE at the time but when i was free from PvE stuff i had the pleasure to get invited to Eternal Ownages premade, top PvP guild of Darksorrow EU. 
---
Quitted retail in Mist of Pandaria and been lurking vanilla private servers ever since. 
---
Gonna main rogue, rush 60 in the first week and start farming pre raid bis / consumables.
---
Entering Molten Core first week/second week would be cool, haha!
---
Please do not hesistate to contact me if you have any questions.
---
Best regards,
---
Johnny
---
Look up Nobbel87 on YouTube
---
Based on my experience, If you enjoy the social side of leveling in groups and in dungeons, you will likely be fine.  Might even think it's fun.  But if you are a solo'er, well... it's probably going to get annoying.
---
A lot of people are saying mages...how much gold per hour are we talking here? Can anyone recommend spots mages can gold farm for each phase of their leveling? For example, is there an ideal farm spot for level 23, level 30, level 40, level 50, etc?
---
This is how you know how important is that guy and his cause lol
---
yea raids are easier with a paladins. Mostly because of blessing of salvation which reduces the threat of your raid. Making it generally much easier especially if your tank is good. A lot of not wiping is about keeping your tanks on top of the agro chart. Also blessing apply to a whole raid and stack while totems only affect your party. 
---
and in PvP in just about every context but AB paladin is a better support than Shaman. 
---
Very large scale pvp paladin better
---
WSG paladin better
---
Small 5 man skirmish paladin better as solo support
---
AV paladin probably better because of bubble and you can make a play into a large amount of people/support elites. But not that huge of a difference AV is more about map layout 
---
In AB shamans are better because they can do a lot more damage if they want. And there are many times during an AB where having your support be able to nuke some one is very very helpful relative to an hpala who can do next to nothing beyond cc from an offensive perspective.
---
vol'jin obvious reasons
---
Thank you, it takes a lot of courage to post something this unique.
---
Postponed?
---
&gt;It's killing the subreddit tbh...
---
Blizzard lack of commitment to a release month is.
---
Isn't the queue time contingent on another player making a character of the opposite faction? I don't think there is any reason to believe it would always be short.
---
The game is called WORLD of WARcraft. The entire history of the game is based around the factions fighting each other. Most people want to PvP because they are invested in the story. (Plus it's fun)  
---
You can roll on a PVE server and never queue for BGs if you don't want to play PvP. No one is stopping you; however, you are missing out a major part of the game.
---
This has been my exact thought since seeing /r/2007scape's progression. They choose good updates from the original game and kept out bad ones, and even introduced new ideas.
---
This was after years to the point where the playerbase declined because the nostalgia rush wore off and people were getting tired of doing the same old content. That's exactly how classic wow should go...give it a few years and then we can ask the question.
---
fuck em. server balance&gt;muh feels
---
ty
---
&gt; Shamans are valued, but I'm a bit concerned about totem management being frustrating
---
Drop totems, and leave them be. You have a set you will be dropping based on group, the worst case, is you will need to refresh your water totem after dropping mana tide. (Most of that micro management is done by raid leader, who will call for your mana tide) If you are horde and you are a raiding shaman, as I said the raid leader will sets your totem set based on your group. Unless you are in the main tank group, you won't need to spam totems every time you pull. Most pulls are going to be pulled back to key locations, where you can put your totems down and not have to worry about re-spawning them for a few pulls at least. (And leveling as ele can be really fun!)
---
As for druids, they are few and far between, but a good druid will be noticed. You're not just a walking b-rez, there's a TON of cleansing to be done in classic raids, and druids cover 2 of the most common (curses and poisons). As well as being a super mobile healer.
---
I have played a number of private servers, as well as playing through classic, the general response to me asking to join a guild or raid was: "HOLY SHIT DRUIDS DO EXIST!" Due to the complex nature of the class in PvP and in solo situations, most people shy away from the class.
---
Paladin healing is mostly tank healing, mashing 1 button gets REALLY boring after a while, ESPECIALLY when you're only healing 1 target, just watching your mana bar deplete. (BOOOOORING) At least with raid healers like shaman and druid, you get some interesting time playing wak-a-mole with health bars.
---
And yes paladin healing is walking up to things, and auto attacking mostly, and waiting for it to die. (snore)
---
I actually do
---
So we've gone from
---
"dodge parry twice in a row will kill you"
---
to
---
"sub level 24, dodge parry twice in a row then two more dodge/parry, on an orange mob, 95% of the time"
---
Which is still horribly wrong, even orange mobs do not do so much damage that they will kill you before you kill them. ESPECIALLY at low levels.
---
Since you're just resorting to "NO UR WRONG" and cheap insults now, I'll go ahead and block you.
---
nO yOu mUsT bE bAd
---
I don't know why it's apparently controversial yo state that rogues are not good in open team fights 10v10ish in vanilla. Your survival mechanisms are shit.
---
...aNd I dOn'T lIkE iT
---
Have you tried do AoE pulls at higher levels? It's really rewarding for me to kill a whole pack of mobs at once.
---
You are like those people who say vanilla raiding is easy all you need is 40 competent people meanwhile not realizing that if it was easy you would not need any competent people.
---
Yeah I agree, but there are normally others there. Up in the hills behind the deadmines, you’re pretty much on your own, and those guys drop cloth and coins 👍
---
I am just as casual as my girlfriend. We've played FFXIV together and she was usually the one pressuring me to move on. I like to read the quest text and take my time!
---
yes this was very good, well done
---
Thanks man. I'm really intrigued by this. I was considering trying to make gold from professions, but this sounds way better. I like the arbitrage approach and getting limited items by logging into alts once in a while sounds like a cool way to do this in the early game.
---
Do you have any recommendations on the top spots to camp? Tbh I know nothing about these vendors and their limited items, it's been so long.
---
Weird. Wowhead vanilla said 1.13. Ty
---
You seem fun
---
When some one pretends they have better reading comprehension than you and you tell them they don't....
---
It's not I am very smart
---
It's I'm smarter than you....
---
SEPTEMBER IS BASICALLY CHRISTMAS.. hahaha this had me lolling at work, thanks for this
---
Time to find another guild.
---
At least your closest gaming friends have their heart on horde so you could make your own guild.
---
So when the game is first released, this process will be lighting fast as there are so many people creating characters. After that, it will slow down. But there are so many people making characters that it won’t ever be too long. If it’s taking a long time it could mean interest in the game is waning heavily, and the  faction balance is the least of our worries.
---
same here
---
I'm somewhat in your boat.  I was lucky enough to start during Vanilla, but it was very late Vanilla (I want to say ~November 2006ish).  So I got to experience that sense of community that made the game great, but I never hit max level until after TBC dropped.  All of the level 60 content is basically brand new to me, I can't wait to play it.
---
I mean, I made the statement and you replied with "no ur wrong" so I clarified and provided evidence for my position. If you have any actual evidence or proof I'd gladly read it, but you've been yet to provide anything.
---
Also that was a very tame response compared to what I wanted to say.
---
That is literally what PvE servers are for. I'm not seeing a problem. Am I misunderstanding something? Can you elaborate? There are PvE servers where PvP is optional, you can opt out of flagging if you don't want to be ganked and camped.
---
On the other hand, a lot of us actually do enjoy the potential threat and risk of being ganked, camped, a quest hub or FP locked down, bringing in our high level friends or alts to drop the hammer and dispense some indiscriminate justice or raid SS for revenge for TM. For most people who play on PvP servers, this is actually fun for us. We like it. For a lot of us, it's more immersive to have that ongoing open conflict and rivalry.
---
I get that not everybody likes this, and that is perfectly fine. There is a server option for that. You won't be forced to play on a PvP realm. If all your friends want to play on PvP, I don't really know what to tell you, if you choose to play on that server just remember that was your choice, and that the server doesn't need to change to accommodate a choice you might regret making and were not obligated to make.
---
Get yourself a Silverback Patriarch! I kept mine up until Legion when I quit playing. They even eat summoned mage bread.
---
Lol you deleted your post? I guess you answered your own question then
---
Haha I can’t argue with that. A the end of the day, your right. We gotta do something
---
People dont play on PvP because they want PvP. They play on PvP servers because they want danger in the world.
---
I started with the various Warcraft manga and comics, not sure if they're considered canon though. Other than that Nobbel87 is your best bet.
---
RP servers will be available. It's RP-PvP that might not exist at launch.
---
I hope they do a couple TBC then later WOTLK servers way into vanilla...while keeling vanilla.
---
ICC and Kara are 2 of the best raids ever imo

I’m Drew now
---
I always thought it would be nice if the difficulty of the content scaled faster than the power of the rewards it provided. So they might come out with a boss or raid that is significantly harder than Naxx but only gives marginally better rewards. Players would have to rely less on their gear and more on pure skill to succeed.
---
Having armor sets and legendaries for every spec would be nice as well.
---
As someone who has been playing on a pvp pserver... 4/5 times I see an enemy questing in my area they wont attack, and even higher rate if they are mounted up people will just stroll past on their way to do their own shit. If you have friends who play and group up, people will double leave you the fuck alone because 2 people is real hard to deal with especially if one has heals.
---
Same.
---
The army of fucking people who refuse to use the search function and keep posting the same set of questions over and over and over and over again every single day are killing the subreddit. You already have to filter through those, so even the memes are a welcome sight.
---
There is no influx of content to speak of because the game isnt out yet
---
We used /assist macros all the time, to make sure you were attacking the same target as the tank
---
S = Strafe Left
---
D = Move Forward
---
F = Strafe Right

Abilities mapped to QWERTAGZXCVB

To handle multiple action bars, use no modifier, shift, ctrl, alt, and ctrl-shift for 5 action bars.

True! I actually really hope they role out the expansions.

Night elf priest, tall and sexy. Looks great in all the sets. That's really all I care about... oh also the mounts are chill. :) 
---
May miss not having easy access to deadmines, but I'll run it on non-nelf alts. Or just take the time to run over anyway.
---
So was fire the only viable raiding spec for mages in Vanilla? I first started back then but never hit level cap before BC. I’m probably gonna love frost, just as I did back in the day, but I was thinking about running PoM-Pyro. Can you raid with that?
---
If it was removed after the initial rush I'd be in favor of this.
---
There’s nothing new to talk about that hasn’t already been covered extensively.  Blizzard could fix this easily by posting some news.
---
I wouldnt work if everyone is logging on and creating 10 characters just to save the names though. It would have to track active characters if that was even possible.
---
Who else but RAMMSTEIN??
---
You dont wanna know
---
Hypocrite
---
That’s an interesting way of utilizing this. 
---
I can agree with that as well.
---
They used spell names for battlegroups.
---
fire or elemental  was pvp only, frost was raiding pve.
---
/assist was a pretty well used command in the Raiding community for getting people on the correct targets for pulls before we had the Skull / X / Diamond ect. marks that we got in later Vanilla.
---
It was also used to focus dps on targets by creating a "/assist playername" macro. Typically Raids would have someone assigned as the "MA" (Main Assist), and all DPS would just hit the Macro whenever their mob died, and follow that player to the next target. Was especially useful in fights like Nef Phase 1 where you needed to switch targets based on priority of mobs. This was usually assigned to a Rogue in my experience, as they didn't have much else to do other than keep up Slice &amp; Dice.
---
I want to do battlegrounds and raid.  Warlock or Mage?  Should I go tailoring on either?
---
If TBC is bottom, what is wotlk and so on? Think about it.
---
MC and BWL require you to be frost because many mosters are fire immune.
---
Standard raid spec is 20 frost 31 arcane iirc.
---
AQ and on fire is best.
---
You go frost for MC and BWL, but fire for AQ
---
lol, I thought of her myself also, but then I remembered she has to buy and lug around all the 1001 stupid grey items every 'hero' sells here day in and day out......  And they NEVER buy her cakes.
---
From what I recall, with a group who knows what they're going for there and where to go, It's like Scarlet Monastery with extra steps.
---
Otherwise, with a group of players who barely knew what they were doing, it was a confusing mess. Some groups I was in back in the day couldn't figure out how to get past the bar and left :/
---
The missing diplomat is my favorite alliance vanilla quest chain. You go halfway around the world, and everywhere you go you just have to tell people “Elling sent me” and they will drop whatever the hell they are doing and help you.

From the Vindicaar it's a rotating globe. You can sit and watch Azeroth twirl and get a rough idea how far away the continents are from each other.

I suspected what you were gonna link and I was not dissapointed! Very cool

Was always hunters in my guilds

If you are into RTS games try to play warcrat 1-3. or at least WC 3 and tft.
---
Hello my fellow Mavs fan who will play Classic. Nice Rogue!
---
Buffing passers-by is like digitally high fiving them and I love it.
---
This is brilliant
---
I'm the same way, though I think nowadays there's likely gonna be at least one person in every group who's knowledgeable enough to act as a tour guide, making sure everyone only goes where they need to without getting lost.
---
Doom Lord Kazzak, who else...
---
Regrettably I'm unable to type anything at the moment, but I consider myself a bit of a Warcraft loremaster, so when I return home from work I'll write up a quick primer for you.
---
My problem is that I have no idea what I'm trying to get out of this game lmao. Which makes me worried its just for nostalgia and that I should just pick the same old class as before (warrior)
---
On the other hand I think I might get hooked again and regret being so heal dependent and weak in 1v1. I considered rogue but I don't like the idea of only being strong because of cooldowns.
---
So I'll probably just go warlock.
---
Kazzak - Dreadlord in charge of legions of demons, inability to actually die just get returned to the twisting nether when you are defeated.  Takes 40 geared heroes to be felled but if more than 40 challenge you, you can go god mode and wipe them all for their hubris.

Story time. I played horde in vanilla and TBC. When latin american servers opened up I lost most of my friends. They didn't speak a word of English and took a free transfer. English being my first language, I was disinclined to transfer to an all Spanish-speaking server. I was really bummed and thought about unsubbing.
---
I used to troll Moon Guard back in TBC when my server was down, but for shits and giggles I rolled and tried to level a human paladin. I made a lot of friends, got sucked into RP, and found that the fresh take and opposite faction perspective on the game really revived my interest in it and I continued to play and enjoy the game.
---
I hopped back and forth between the two factions depending on who I wanted to play with. My preference will always be horde, but I found changing things up made the game kind of "new" again and rekindled my waning interest. I probably wouldn't have continued playing if I didn't change it up every now and then. Get hyped to see new storylines and different perspectives on old storylines.
---
I agree but there is no "picking up where you left off", servers will die after naxx. So when you return you're rerolling on recent fresh servers not continuing on your old characters.
---
I don’t think they give a fuck about this sub tbf
---
I played both during vanilla.  I started mage for pvp then realized the only class mages lost to in a 1v1 really was the druid.  As a druid in raids all I ever did wass heal.  That may change in classic as guilds are less strict these days than they were back then.  
---
Druids are pretty good at getting around the world since they have the moonglade teleport.
---
These comments are the most annoying.
---
Paladins
---
all combinations have shift and alt variants
---
wheel up and down - main attacks(shift strong attacks/finishers or heroic/overpower type of attacks - alt (aoe or focus)
---
middle click - movement abilities (warrior mid is charge/battlestance,with shift its zerk stance/intercept with alt its focus intercept)
---
\` - autorun
---
w - forward
---
ad - strafe
---
q - defensive cooldowns (same with shift and alt)
---
e - offensive cooldowns
---
r - trinkets ( +shift 2nd trinket +alt are helmets )
---
f - interrupts (as war f is normal interrupt shift+f is fear alt+f is nade)
---
s - unique abilities like stealth / racials sometimes ranged weapon like wanding/shooting depends on class
---
c/v - self healing abilities potions food(bandages/potion/toobers/food)
---
z/x - generators - rage pots thistle tees bloodthirst stuff like that
---
1234/shift - usefull things / long cooldwons - alt 1 is mount 234 are macro gear swap for helms or gear sets
---
alt zxcv - utility for w/e might be needed 
---
zoom in zoom out remapped to ctrl+wheel
---
bar switching unmapped
---
f1-f5 - marking targets skull/x/square/moon/star
---
shift+f1-f5 - targeting those marks
---
Nah, never. Long term end game is what it's all about and we're good.
---
thanks!
---
lol, not sure if you replied to the wrong person, but I'm on your side here. I thought your initial post was already pretty clear, but the [guy above me](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm7926/process_for_faction_balance_on_servers/emug1yl/) apparently couldn't grasp that your proposal wouldn't force people into a faction they didn't want.
---
My experience from pserver tanking as prot in 5 mans is that stacking threat is where it's at. You aren't as worried about mitigation. At 60, speccing improved seal of righteousness and adding +30sp helps. You can feel the impact.
---
I'm tired of people searching by hot and wondering where all the discussion has gone.
---
It's sitting in new where it's always been, people don't upvote discussion and never have. There's still the same amount of posts asking everything from basic class questions to interesting guides.
---
It's your fault for searching by hot or popular. If you searched by new, you'd see threads like this get made every few days and get (rightly) downvoted to oblivion.
---
Some people play for different reasons.
---
Some want to play just to play for fun, go for it.
---
Some play to be the best they can be. For these players, Shadow is not the right choice.
---
Do what makes Classic the most fun for you.
---
the best song is ['Hard like heroic'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=xciuYTeu4Qc) although it technically is a TBC song, it oozes classic nostalgia for me
---
Do we know why they renamed it ? Is Nicker a „bad“ word or something ?
---
This was very fun but i would be nice with some actual gameplay to see how it does
---

---
You don’t need 40 competent people for vanilla raids
---
The first 40 levels shouldn't be too bad, most people on Classic will either be new or rusty so you will be on evenish footing with the exception of the occasional old veteran or a Pserver player.
---
Post 40.... I hope you can get your skills sharp by them because that when things get crazy and people actually know what they are doing.  Best of luck.
---
If you only earned 12000 RP a week you would never hit R14 due to the 20% decay.
---
Also, premades don't need to rotate members, if they're playing correctly they should aim to bracket stack by everyone getting the exact same honor value so they all get ranked in a tie.
---
Her bakery is a front for the largest junk recycling operation in Azeroth
---
The best 2h we get is only a wee bit more dps than the 1hander we get until level 20~ ish, and the shield and shieldbash is needed a lot earlier on, coupling that with a need to level the weapon skill, not really worth it imo. (The staff from the red crystal quest in Darkshore, then the People's Militia quest sword in Westfall)
---
Yeah, that's definitely a trade off. A general trend of the game is that it's more about multi-player strategy and less about individual players pushing lots of buttons. Unfortunately, nothing plays quite like what you're describing. If you're interested in raiding, Mages and Warlocks are mostly using frostbolt and shadowbolt. Shadow Priests are pretty much doing the same with mind flay. and being out of mana. If you change your mind and want to PvP, you have way more variety and a ton of class choices.
---
If you're looking for something more interactive, Hunters might be right up your alley. For the most part, they only use three abilities, Aimed Shot, Multi Shot, and Auto Shot, but they have to manage their animations, cooldowns, and Auto Shot timer &amp; resets to get the most out of their damage. It feels more rewarding and skill fun than the way you described getting bored of constantly spamming frostbolt, and it might be worth looking into based on your interests. Otherwise, Rogues and Fury Warriors are pretty interactive DPS classes as well. Good luck on your search for a class =)
---
Who gives a fuck if you like it or not
---
Not really the point of your post, but FYI rogues who just keep up S&amp;D are bad. Maxing rogue dps actually requires careful timing and attention to swing and energy timers.
---
I've had bad luck with those spots in recent times...they're for one of the latter steps in the westfall chain leading into deadmines and seem to be constantly camped by actual questers.  Been a month or so since I've actually been through there other than to run to ZG island though...so could have just been bad timing on my part.
---
Man this just brought back some memories. I had a really shitty old laptop with one of those little red mouse buttons in the middle of the keyboard. I used that thing for like 2 years.
---
There is a “blue tracker” on the official forums you can f5, but it also reports regular bfa blue posts so be prepared to disappoint yourself. 
---
You could also spam f5 on this subreddit sorted by new if you’re okay with waiting an extra 4-5 seconds to read the blue post after it is posted.
---
I have a feeling I'm gonna catch a ton on shot for this, but I only use hotkeys 1-4. Everything else gets clicked.  I use bartender and arrange my bars into a small box under my toon. Less tunnel vision that way. I also rotate with the mouse.  I'm going to try mapping keys around wasd and adopting that method. This may explain why I'm garbage at pvp.
---
keep yer nose clean in my town...
---
👏Dump 👏 that 👏 bitch👏
---
I came here everyday just for those memes
---
Stiches!
---
Roll PvP if you like the sound of it - this sub makes it sound much worse than it is.
---
You can mostly choose whether to engage or not - if you don't relish getting camped in Redridge, start trekking towards Darnassus, not in the mood for STV? then head on over to salt flats/southshore.
---
If you want to be prepared for world pvp, I would recommend grinding an extra level or two before you enter a new zone - you give yourself a fantastic leg up in terms of pvp.
---
YES! I like your style, even though you beat me to it. 
---
Every now and again they muster a 40-man raid of all level 1's. You just stand there like "Let them come!"
---
Glad it wasn't just me. Also wearing blackhand's trinket is unlikely at that point with his other gear.
---
huh
---
What's the N word? 
---
I'm not even American so please feel free to explain this magic word to me.
---
this is basically another way of saying "wHaT dO wE dO aFtEr NaXxRaMaS gUys?"
---
Yeah, you do. There are so many ways bad player can wipe the raid. Pulling aggro on dragons or linking in c'thun for instance.
---
I was thinking about going for the nightelf and dwarf start videos once I finish the rest.
---
Improving your rep gains is hard, we miss loch modan quests and ashenvale quests only, in place of human zones like Duskwood and Redridge, but in terms of rep, human is easy to hit exalted, so you can skip the human zones and go for the others. The problem is that the quests in one zone may make the other zone's quests grey. So if rep is what you are after, I would say skip Redridge, Westfall, and Duskwood and instead do Loch Modan and Ashenvale. 
---
Beyond that point (level 30~ ish) we end up doing almost every quest in the game though so no further changes would be needed.
---
Starshards is fun while leveling too.  Shame it scales so poorly with +damage like most priest damage.
---
You say my arguments suck, but you don't even fully address them, nor do you share much of your own. You read half of a sentence, then ignore the remaining main argument in the sentence. E.g. "By the time you finally get Flurry which won't proc reliably with your low crit, **you are almost 40 and it is time to switch to mortal strike anyways.**" This is called cherry picking.
---
I will defend both parts of the sentence in any case. I'll do second part (most important point) first.
---
***"...you are almost 40 and it is time to switch to mortal strike anyways."*** I'm not refuting that flurry is a good talent. It is that by the time you start to put points into it, it is time to respec. Mortal strike &gt;&gt; Bloodthirst until you get lots of AP, and is far superior for world pvp. Okay, so for a few levels and one really good level, you get to enjoy Flurry. This means I would never judge whether I level as Fury based on this talent. It is irrelevant from my decision making of taking fury. You get impale and deep wounds far earlier in arms tree and therefore get way more use out of them. If you compare fury's options at those levels, get unbridled wrath, and... yawn... Oh sorry, where was I? 
---
***"By the time you finally get Flurry which won't proc reliably with your low crit..."*** When you deal a crit with flurry at the beginning of the fight, you hit the lottery. You are going to kill that mob fast. Same thing with arms as you get a full deep wounds off and impale instantly. However, if you crit towards the bottom third of the hp pool of the enemy, you don't get all 3 swings of the flurry with a slow 2H. With arms, you get the full impale always and maybe a tick of deep wounds. Knowing how you responded the first time, you will likely try to cherry pick something from this paragraph, and ignore the most important point in the previous paragraph.
---
You act like there aren't locations with densely packed mobs to grind all over azeroth. This is the dumbest thing you said. Every zone has mobs evenly spaced in a way that makes it easy to kill one or two or many at a time. Plus at the point you have sweeping strikes, you have intercept as well. You can charge, auto, rend, intercept second target, rend, then sweeping strikes both targets. You can do this 3 times as often (another point you decided not to address.)
---
My leveling arms spec doesn't grab axe/sword spec. I instead prioritize two hand weapon specialization, imp overpower, imp charge, etc. It is for the reason you shared. I want talents that will work no matter what weapon I use for the reason you discussed. Imp charge gets you rage for your 30 rage sweeping strikes. You also say sweeping strikes is too expensive. This is laughable. Let's address that. It costs 20 rage to cleave once. It costs 30 rage, with sweeping strikes, to cleave 5 times (100 rage value minimum)!!! And it works on yellow attacks, including cleave itself! One cleave with sweeping strikes = two cleaves. You get 20 rage worth of damage added back if you cleave. This also increases your opportunities for overpower which are 60+% crit chance meaning you're putting nasty deep wounds up reliably. All of that without reducing survivability.
---
Piercing howl is nice. I like it. I don't like it more than anger management. Anger management will preserve my rage while passively generating rage. This adds up to damage to kill more efficiently over the long run. Piercing howl is a crutch for "oops, I aggro'ed too many mobs." I will just use my ranged weapon to pull them to a safe spot, rather than charging near other packs and problem solved.
---
Everything I said is about optimization. If you like Fury because you like it, power to you. I don't plan to play a suboptimal spec with a lower leveling speed class, so I am going arms. On a pvp server, its not a close contest. Being able to swap to defensive stance, preserve rage, and disarm your opponent is important to me as well. There aren't wasted talents in arms. Warriors who level fury don't learn stance dancing until they are dozens of hours into playing. 
---
**"Also your arguments suck."** I actually made arguments. You didn't even put forth rationale with your arguments. There isn't a worse argument than one without any rationale to refute other then just saying "these are amazing." I shared my rationale. I opened up on my reasons. **Save your emotional language and stick to your rationale and theories.**

The second clip playing in the background (which I linked the full version of in the description of the video) is a 2006 Twin Emps clear from the point-of-view of the Warlock tank.

Let The Bodies Hit The Floor - Drowning Pool.

If your PvP video wasn't zooming in on big ass crits on the first " Let the bodies his the .... TISS TISS", you're doing it wrong.
---
Inb4 people start explaining all the abilities and utility of each class
---
Ye actually /played on my first character was something like 25-30 days. Maybe i could achieve 8-12 now.
---
Both are equally viable, I don't think you're asking Reddit or yourself the right question:) Tailoring &amp; Engineering for sure
---
I'm considering exactly these three classes as well, and my mind isn't completely made up yet on which of the three I will play. Unfortunately I have many RL obligations so playing more than one of it of the question.
---
Druid is a blast to play, but I feel that the gear progression is lacking. There really aren't any decent feral sets and you are stuff grinding AB and WSG rep for alot of pieces, which takes aaaaages, and then waiting on AQ 40 for the rest, while also desperately trying to convince your guild to go for world dragon kills for a decent weapon. That is the biggest downside for me.
---
Hunter is probably the highest skill cap and lowest skill floor of the group, but all have relatively high skill caps. Easy to gear, but less in demand. My goal should I roll a Hunter is full t1 and zihn'rok in addition to rhok'delar.
---
Shaman is the one in least experienced in and they really lack in CC / mobility, but have a high skill cap and can pvp and pve in a 30/0/21 spec. Seems like slot of fun but again, waiting on AQ 40 before the gear starts to really support it.
---
Hmmmm, decisions decisions
---
Yeah people seem to forget that anything that applies a non-synergistic debuff will be disallowed.  
---
Rend, flame shock, storm strike, poison arrow, corruption... All show up in individual DPS tests, but are never allowed in most vanilla raids.
---
If you prefer them, Nelf for sure!
---
Unless you get really angry from being ganked then dont worry about it. Role PvP but if you dont want any trouble, dont attack people, and if you see an enemy try /dance or /wave and just go about your business. A lot of the time people just want to continue questing unless theres a pvp battle on the map (STV) then they'll kill you but I wouldnt worry about it
---
I remember assist macros. Even after target markers I still like to use them to make sure I'm attacking the tank's target.
---
yes but tanking twin emperor is normal and not specific for your guide. 
---
Would like to see some physical tanking or dungeon run
---
God I love this sub
---
The demand for TBC and WOTLK is just as high as vanilla it appears. Good news!
---
Just play the race you like more. Racials are very nice, but not worth playing a race you don't like as much imo. Unless you plan on being a hardcore world folirst raider that is
---
this is a good summary
---
Or you're gonna tell mom!!
---
clearly you never played Warcraft 1
---
I tried Warcraft 1 and 2 a few months ago for the exact reason of playing back through them, but it was an absolute slog. I barely made it through half the orc campaign. I gave up and just watched YouTube videos of all the campaigns instead. Those games did not stand the test of time imo.
---
3 is definitely replayable, though.
---
Solid Pick
---
ya...that's everyone's argument who wants alliance and i get it.
---
Some people (like my wife) will take an eternity to make their char look just so. I feel sorry for the bastards that would have to wait for her to finish, and god forbid she decides to change factions before she's done.
---
The green forests of Elwynn and Loch Modan
---
The amber fields of Westfall
---
The crimson hills of Redridge
---
The snowy peaks of Dun Morough
---
The quiet, shadow zones of Teldrassil, Darkshore, and Duskwood
---
Whereas in horde, you get... the shitty deserts of Durotar, the Barrens, Thousand Needles, Stonetalon Mountains, Badlands. And the dank swamps of Duskwallow and Swamp of Sorrows?
---
Musical themes that evoke pride, majesty, or intrigue instead of "URGH. RAHHHH" and random drums.
---
Like a 90 second flight to BRD/MC/UBRS/LBRS/BWL instead of a.... how do you guys even get to those dungeons?
---
Gryphons and Hippogryphs instead of whatever the fuck those monsters are that the horde fly on.
---
he does not like that wall 
---
lol good post
---
Look forward the ability to smite down those Horde heretics. Roll Paladin and don’t look back, brother.
---
I play horde and prefer to have a smaller population because it means more opportunities for world pvp. More alliance to gank.
---
I wanna bop nerds with 2h shaman but idk if blizzard is going to bring that back to life the way it was. Any word that winfury will still be a thing?
---
Really want to play Lock but have never played one at max and don’t know how good I’ll be. 
---
I want to both raid and pvp. My mains have been ele sham and boom.
---
Do you think I can/should do it? Will I get into raids or do I have to be a god to play this class?
---
Yeah, guess the old controls make it real tedious. Dont also forget the epilogue of WC 3 :)
---
Damn. I heard talk about an unofficial RP-PVP tho
---
no, im not gonna call you that
---
I love that the top three posts are Office memes right now. Life really is that simple.
---
It would depend on rounding done, but yeah its wrong anyway.
---
I doubt bracket stack was a thing in retail vanilla, its a private server thing in my opinion, it should not work.
---
you will be fine.  and remember the posts about alts.  those don't even need to be real leveling alts.  I have never played on a PVE server.  in the RARE cases that I felt I needed to pause my main because of pvp issues, I just went to my bank alt(s) , organizing mailboxes , bags and putting stuff on the auction house.  that was time very well spend, and after a few minutes I was done and I could go back to my main.
---
And you got a vanilla wow content creator
---
spending 5 minutes /assisting the tank to get your garr add to banish
---
I love the sense of common reciprocity from this set up. Two people running each other through their respective instances until they'll achieved all their loot. Its cooperation at its best.
---
Sadly I never got to do Strath back in the day (or ever), but as far as I've seen it's a solid B at least. But then the mount attained by the hardmode timed mechanic immediately makes it at least B+ to me. 
---
I love how many dungeons in Vanilla had built-in mechanics that sadly were only reiterated upon in WotLK.
---
First, I'd play what you want rather than what leveling combo is optimal.
---
Second, if you aren't looking to dedicate to speedrunning, then I'd just play what's most fun rather than being hyper-optimal. 
---
Warlock/Mage has mostly upsides than downsides. Tons of CC, AoE capabilities, vending machine/healthstones, you got it all. The major downside is you would be competing for gear, though it's not a huge deal for me.
---
I'll be duo-leveling as a warlock with a warrior buddy of mine. It's not great because warriors are kind of eh while leveling. I don't really mind that though because it's the classes we want to play :)
---
&gt; Showing a ratio in game would be terrible because no one will want to roll on the smaller faction on a server.
---
Eh. I'll always choose the server with less of my faction (alliance) than the horde. I value faster queues over environment domination.
---
My buddy and I are also going to duo level... I'm going Mage and he's either gonna go Paladin or Priest.  I'm thinking either would be great.. with Priest, I could stand and take damage and just AoE shit down while he shields/heals me.. and as a Paladin, he'd go Prot and hold aggro while I AoE shit down... we haven't decided which route yet.
---
That's a lot of damn money for a vanilla character
---
Peak male performance
---
When I first looked at the pic, I legit thought this post was going to be about the original (and much cuter) female nelf faces in vanilla.
---
Your numbers are a bit off, 45 agi doesn't even give 1 crit its only 0.85 + whatever 4 weapon skill gives which I think is ~0.16. -5agi for enchant difference your looking at 80ap and 0.9 crit. The extra hit is irrelevant.
---
Its still arguably bis when world buffed and maybe for ally, but horde hatchet+kingsfall is bis
---
that would be incredible thank you!
---
Don't play classic if you want current retail features in it.  
---
That is what made classic so fun, there was not a bunch of hand holding and you actually needed to communicate with people to get stuff accomplished.  LFG tool would ruin classic.
---
Question specifically about endgame gear and scalability **in PVP** environment**.**
---
Can you rate how Hunters, Shamans (Ele and Enh) and Druids (Feral hybrids) scale late game vs in PvP? I've been reading that both hunters and Ele shamans scale pretty bad once people start getting epic gear and so on...
---
I need a class for an alt, my main will be a paladin, so i need something with another playstyle..
---
Im thinking: mage, warlock, hunter, or rogue. 
---
Warr, druid and priest are too similiar.
---
Ive played hunter, warlock, druid to 60. They all have their cons and pros... but im just not sure.
---
good point. this might be enjoyable to watch on youtube rather than playing it myself!
---
do people still play WC3 online?
---
Sounds like Crendor to me
---
I used to do that exact thing.
---
I think that depends on what you consider viable. Will you find a spot as a critchicken in some hardcore progression guild? Probably not. Will you find a spot if you look for a relaxed/casual guild that cares more about the player and less the class? Absolutely. 
---
People cleared bosses in vanilla with all manner of wonky specs and item builds, if you wanna be a critchicken, be a crit chicken dude, you will 100% enjoy the game more playing the class/spec you want and in the long run those are the people that will commit to raid times and show up.
---
The only true "viable" class is any class/spec played by someone who shows up regularly and on time for raids.
---
&gt;Sounds like the Ep100 where they waste Kevin's &gt;time with SP-attackspeed paladins..
---
Do we know anything about how that will work in classic? You seem to be against them but I haven't seen anyone provide any sort of proof that they wouldn't work.
---
&gt;Also how was he getting plate drops at level 10 &gt;when plate doesn't drop till level 40.  Sounds like &gt;a bunch of bullshit.
---
Most likely thinking of mail and misspoke.
---
Exactly! Someone else did all the tedious work. Though 3+ are worth playing if you haven't.
---
I would kindda agree with you, im happy with my warlock and as far as i can tell, warlock goes good with almost all classes. 
---
The gear thing is not my main concern since most of the gear will come from quests rather than dungeon runs. 
---
Warrior is a heck more fun to play when duo leveling in my opinion so i think warlock and warrior is going to be a lot of fun for you. Thanks for your input.
---
My experience was pretty consistently get 30% in (if that) then one person leaves and the whole group collapses 😂
---
Definitely try to run with guildies if possible or you’re very unlikely to make it to the end. That is, if you have a half day on your hands lol
---
PVP trinket? AGM(s)? Lucky Fishing Hat? Good thing Classic is coming out soon so 24(?) year old you can show 11 year old you how it's done.
---
so that plus expertise is not such a huge deal as everyone says?
---
You can be the "hero that fight bad guys" the bad guys are not the "enemy of the month" but the other faction. Not there leaders, the generals but the players.
---
Classic isn't writen so that the player is the ultimate hero. Its not a single player story.
---
You are just a random advanturer that can be the hero that saves someones farm. Or the Hero! That collect hoofs.
---
honestly, the constant posts of "what class should i play" etc are the most bothersome to me. every time i see one i'm just like i dunno man do what a majority (if not all) of us did and pick one, play it for a while and see if you like it.
---
 i like the memes. at least they're somewhat original and amusing.
---
Definetely yes, Playing through Warcraft 3 is one of the best ways to prepare for Classic.
---
I'd suggest playing Warcraft 3 and then reading Cycle of Hatred as both lead up to Classic WoW. 
---
If you want to go back even further, there are more books and Warcraft 1 and 2 of course. But seeing, how Classic WoW is not that far away anymore, you should probably focus on the events that happened directly prior to Classic WoW.
---
1. 2. 3. 4. Q. E. F. Tab. Shift q. Shift e. Shift f. Then all my 12 buttons on my Naga
---
there's a ton of people currently streaming pserver that take in slowly.
---
Am I the only one who is WAY more excited for WC3 reforged?
---
Paladins are busted and you wont have deal with them as enemies on Alliance.
---
Salvation &gt; WF in raids once your DPS has their shit together.
---
My point was that you cant shit on flurry cause"you dont have enough crit" and then go point at impale and deep wounds and say they are good. I never said sweeping costs too much. I said your comparison to death wish was unfair for a number of reasons you did not actually address.
---
You ignore the best talents in fury and focus on the worst ones. 
---
You wont be bow pulling mobs to safe spots all the time while you quest. Ypu meed to get to the end of the cave or w e. Mobs spawn on top of you. When fighting two or more mobs, piercing is very valuable. You will be fighting two or more mobs since you are using sweeping. 
---
See I am not really trying tp argue in favor of fury as a leveling spec so I dont really need to address all your points. 
---
Just because you can pull 2 mobs at a time in most places doesn't mean you will always be able to.... 
---
You are constantly misrepresenting my statements. I never said sweeping was too expensive. I never said the mobs weren't dense enough in the world. This is called strawman.
---
I am going to cherry pick something. You crot a mob at low HP? Flurry is not wasted. Pull another mob and use flurry stacks. 
---
Im not acting like anything, Im being realistic.
---
You are being misleading, and you don't appear to have mastery of this topic.
---
As an experienced shadow priest, theorycrafter and simulation curator, I can't say you are wrong, but you simplify the statement to the point of being inaccurate. Mana is certainly the enemy, but hope is not lost for almost all fights pre-Naxx (Nefarian the notable exception). If you are in a decent guild, most pre-Naxx fights will be in the 1-3 minute range, or have breaks, or opportunities to get spirit tap procs (such as C'Thun, long but with breaks and killing blows).
---
Shadow has high base spell damage (not including gear) and more modifiers than other classes. The problem is that shadow essentially only scales with spell damage and to a small extent, hit. And the scaling it can get from spellpower isn't so hot either. The average spell coefficient of a proper shadow rotation is around 50% (mind blast 42%, mind flay 45.8%, SWP 133%). Compare this to a warlock at 85% or fire mage at 100%. This means that while shadow can do solid dps initially, it can't keep up as other classes gain hit and crit and take advantage of that higher average coefficient.
---
On my simulation post on [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) I explain that a smart shadow priest should prepare to switch to one of the healing specs come Naxx, and I specifically mention picking up 8/8 T2 to close the gear gap as easily as possible. It is also beneficial to have a dps that can switch to healing as healing demands increase to help roster balance. So while you are not wrong, you aren't taking into account different stages of the game.
---
No personal experience, but it's awesome.
---
Raids normally take time and consumables. Most folk know the classic fights well, so gearing up your character well will be expected for a raiding spot.
---
What I would suggest is getting yourself into a guild now, with players with casual plans, who’ll raid 1-2 a week, and are not about rushing to 60!
---
As long as you learn the fights, come prepared, are on time &amp; reliable, then most guilds will see you are a team player, and you could help fill out when they are short. So not committing week in week out.

Why does shaman suck to level?
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4) gives a great breakdown of different duo leveling pairs. 
---
I'm not an expert but from what I see, Warlock Mage would be a great Single Target Nuke combo. The main concern would be the Mage slowing down the Warlock by having to wait for mana to regen, but they should have similar movement speeds, are both solid PVP classes, both are fairly gear independant, a Warlock's Voidwalker is a nice tank for both classes, a Warlock has little downtime and if they ever needed it, mage can conjure food and water.
---
The Mage can portal the pair to major cities and the Warlock can summon other players there as well. I think it'd be fairly solid, but there may be glaring flaws that I'm missing. I haven't looked at most of a Warlock's kit, I'm much more familiar with mage.
---
If you level a priest to 60, people will beg you to raid and with them, and you'll get targeted first in PvP because you're  more vulnerable than the people you're healing. Priest is the path to the good life, if you don't mind playing a cloth caster.
---
Paladin heals well in pvp, and you'll probably be the last to die. Lots of survivability, but extremely support focused, since you can't do much except holy light, shield, and BOP.
---
Shaman are highly sought after, mostly for totem buffs. In both PvP and raids, you'll follow your favorite DPS around to give them windfury, heals, and occasionally make someone evaporate with chain lightning.
---
I want the release date as much as everyone else, but these posts are helping with the wait.... :)
---
awww yeaaah big gorilla balls in everyone's face
---
Do you plan on using this in raids in classic?  Do you have a guild willing to let you?
---
I agree. The horde get very butthurt when you kill them. Then they group up and corpse camp you for killing them once.
---
You're the second person to reference shorter flight paths..Ya'll for real? I had no idea.
---
Oh I'm excited to duo with a warrior, don't get me wrong. I should have clarified that from a speedrunning perspective it's not ideal (which we will be doing).
---
As for loot, i totally get that and that's why it's not a huge deal in my book. Also you are correct, warlocks are amazing with anything imho.
---
Oh shit its 0.04 not 0.4% per skill isnt it
---
To the top!
---
[there’s a pretty in-depth video](https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg)  that Tipsout did of all of the classes in a raid setting and compares the top logs each class. 
---
He touches a little in the hunter section, basically they perform pretty well during MC and BWL because they don’t need the gear to do the dmg, but once gear starts getting better the gap widens 
---
Hunters are still one of the best solo pvp specs if you know how to play the matchups 
---
Hybrid classes suffer from a whole new set of problems tho usually
---
Humans have very good racials, better than Night Elves, but if you like Night Elves way more then you have to decide if you think a minor bonus is worth playing a race you don't like as much. Personally, I would say just go with Night Elf.
---
Troll's make way better resto shamans because of their Berserking racial, but I like orc shamans so much more so I'm just rolling with that
---
No
---
I want to play a paladin, I love tanking though. but would I be able to play prot paladin in five man dungeons at least? I don’t mind healing raids but if I can play tank in five man dungeons I’d be happy at least.
---
Weird guess you are correct.
---
Looks like they've been using the tbc buffed version on most servers for a while: https://web.archive.org/web/20071023204849/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemhistory.html?witem=22819 (updated to ~4k armor 90 block 2 days before 2.0 dropped)

Nobbel87's videos are great. The problem is that he focuses more on modern Wow, where a lot has been retconned and might not go along well with the original books and games. I'd rather go for the original sources especially when preparing for Classic.

Yeah that would be op as hell for melee

I hope to god it isn't July 16... there's one week all summer that I'm gonna be out of town, and it's during the week of July 16 FeelsBadMan just let me play on release

---
Uh, I think you'll find you will be.
---
we gotta get these shopping carts in the lake, Julian

I don't think warlock/mage is a common duo because there is no avoiding the competition for gear.  That doesn't make the biggest impact though, if you think it's more fun.  I did duo rogues with my friend and had a great time back in vanilla and that should have been horrible (stacking DR's AND competition on gear).
---
A wow subscription will allow you access to classic. That’s it.
---
Thanks, and yeah that makes sense I hadn’t really thought about it from that perspective. I’m most likely not going to be attempting to join any hardcore guilds, so I’ll keep that in mind.

It's the opposite for me. The warm inns of dun morogh, the mystery of teldrasil, the familiarity of Elwyn. I just can't get into the bright screaming orange that the horde has to endure. What race will you be rolling? Maybe try doing a more RP experience, that's what I'll be trying

You can even become less of a pug and more of a sought out mercenary if you Igor your stuff. I became more of a casual player in wotlk but still had other guilds asking me to come along to clear progression content because I was a shadow priest that did the job well. Cleared heroic 25man ICC as a pug.
---
You’re going to be rolling on all the same gear and on top of that you’re both going to be drinking every 10 seconds of you don’t employ double wanding with a void walker help tank. At 40 the mage is going to feel like dead weight if he can’t afford his mount. Double dps will also make it harder to find groups. You can make it work, but it’s not that good. Double mage if anything is much better you have the double sheep to full heal each other in duels, STV with double could snaps means you are unfuckwithable. I would pair anything else with the warlock than a mage though.

I had a 'nightmare' a few weeks ago where classic was a mobile game
---
MC is more faceroll, but once you get to PUG BWL people really need to not mess up and that's when being good will get you sought out especially.
---
wow lots of stuff to catch up. will get to it then
---
Warlocks have a lot of buttons when it comes to PVP and you'll definitely to keybind it all if you aren't someone who typically binds every ability/item (for instance on Classic I tend to use action paging for additional binds); but, in regards to PVE, you'll only have 5-6 buttons total for PVE: Maintain your assigned curse if you have one, Shadow Bolt, Shadowburn for movement, Life Tap for movement/mana, a couple binds for consumes, and that's about it. So, in PVE you should be pretty safe and will do fine but, PVP you will have a ton of extra keys to get used to.
---
When I hit 60 I will come back to guard STV alliance levelers.

I remember the ambush crits like it was yesterday.
---
You often do bring one for a PVE raid with the warrior group but their role is boring. Totem twisting and healing on some bosses. They’re never outright dpsing.
---
This thread gets a gold star for entertainment value. I love reading good trash talking while drinking my coffee. 
---
One thing i will add is my opinion on the accuracy of private servers, since that seems to be at the core of the argument. I 100% agree that none of them are perfect, but the aspects of which they are the most inaccurate are things like scripting, armor and resistance values, proc rates, stat caps, and drop rates. These are behind the scenes values that were never directly exposed to the playerbase and could only be inferred. But, things like Stat weighting, talents, Gear, item scaling, ability DPS, weapon DPS, pet DPS, NPC HP, NPC damage, ability costs, and cooldowns were not only all well understood at the time, but they were well documented. Mangos, which is the core data model behind almost every vanilla private server, began development in 2005. 
---
Now, it hasn't been until recently afaik that we've seen truly blizzlike emulation on a large scale. No\*\*\*\*\*\*\* was about 5 years ago so i'll use that as a starting point. It's difficult for me to believe that from 2004-2006 and then the last 5 years there has been either something so wrong with the servers or with the theory crafting that the entire hunter meta will change. If the biggest problems with private servers are addressed with classic (NPC resistance and armor) then that would scale hunter along with all the other classes. I can't come up with, on my own, something that would only impact hunter in a positive way or affect every other class but hunter in a negative way. It's also possible there is some neo-level hunter out there that could totally revolutionize the class, but given the math that's been done and my faith on the accuracy of that math given what i've said about private servers, i don't see a reason to believe this. For this discussion to be more productive there would need to be more specifics given for why and how the meta would change. 
---
All that said, i do think hunters get a worse wrap than they deserve. It's a fun class with a high skill ceiling and a low barrier to entry. Good with pvp at all levels, great utility, and there is nothing preventing a raid from bringing 2-4 hunters except for pure min-maxing at higher tiers. I disagree entirely with those who dissuade people from playing hunters using the argument 'they suck later on'. Sucking is relative. A good hunter is better than a crap mage. But even looking at 'all things being equal', even the most hard of the hard core will need a hunter. I was in a hard core guild that kept two hunters, and when they both stopped playing during naxx for RL issues, guess what? Our hard core guild couldn't progress until we found a hunter (Gluth). But there were hardly any around with the necessary gear because so many people were turned away from playing the class early on. 
---
So while i disagree the meta will change, i do agree that hunters deserve a larger share of endgame content.

My movement keys to this day. Mouse is for changing camera and looting. Keys are bound, though my keyboard sucks so I bought a razer naga. I started on a laptop though and all number keys were easy to reach, and CDs were bound to F keys. They all still are, with a secondary bind to shift + numbers. I can get on a laptop and keep playing the way I used to, but still play on that STUPID keyboard for my desktop.
---
Stuck between hunter and priest
---
I don't have anyone else to play with so I figure a hunter would be good for soloing content until I found a guild. Plus i absoultely love the hunter aesthetic and playstyle
---
On the other hand i feel like as a priest it'll be much easier to make friends and find a guild. 
---
Thoughts?
---
I've played so much vanilla over the past few years and know exactly what I will be doing in the game. It won't take me very long to get to raid log status and I'll play TBC in between raids and consumable farming. At least that's the plan as of now.
---
I first started off right at launch on a PVE server and I was in Arathi (before BGs) on my lvl 34 human shadow priest specc'd fully for PVP (i hilariously thought wands and spirit tap was pointless, went full blackout, etc, man that grind sucked) and dueled a Tauren Shaman at 41 or 42 and beat him.
---
Game was so new I'm sure he sucked and his spec was garbage too, but people were literaly aghast. I dotted and mind flayed him, mana burn, fear, MB, etc etc.
---
People wern't used to seeing a shadow priest and just thought they were squishly heal bots.

I’ve played this for many years. I don’t recall that I have ever seen a dwarf rogue. I honestly though ‘can dwarfs be rogues?’ When I saw this post
---
I'm not really into "Classic prepping" because there's so many questions that need to be answered about so many numbers and formulas and yada yada (all of my videos have been plagued by this so far so I still don't really know what class I'm gonna "main"). But I have secured a close friend to duo level a Pally with me as Warlock, so we're gonna go around and try Locktanking all the dungeons on the way to 60 at a casual pace (though we were already planning on going Pally/Warlock months before I even knew that Warlocks could tank). If I hit 60, I'll try to see what the Raid scene is like after putting together some appropriate gear, but I have no idea how long it'll take me to get there (duo levelling scheduling being what it is). It'll also be much easier to get into MC later on in the "phases" of Classic due to the greater availability of spell penetration gear necessary for a Firelock to tank Fire-resistant enemies.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit#gid=0) is one i found on this sub. Dunno how up to date it is tho

It wasn't a bug, it was working as intended at that point in time.

It will probably be fine for the start of vanilla, but as we progress to harder raids and itemization becomes less and less "random" I think it will be hard to justify for any raid leader.

I would argue the memes are the only thing keeping the subreddit active. With hardly any new news from Blizzard... what do you expect people to talk about.

I can give you some feedback on druids. I did main a resto shaman in TBC, but not vanilla, so can't help a lot there.
---
I loved playing a druid and am pretty sure I will roll one for classic, but am not sure if it will be my main or alt. Here's what to expect:
---
-You can pretty much tank/heal/dps most dungeons up to maybe ST/Mara as feral. You will not be great healing or great dps, but a lot of times warm bodies are just needed in five-mans. The pro is that people will love your flexibility. You can pop out of form, bres someone, heal yourself, toss a hot on someone else, and be the star of a badly pulled almost wipe. The heart of the wild tree is best for this.
---
-I've also leveled resto before, yes I am silly, but never found it too hard to kill things. Keep a healing set and a feral set with you at all times though. 
---
-Resto druids have some disadvantages as healers in five mans. Unless there's a pally or shadow priest or dps shaman, you are limited to a 30-minute bres. This is not a problem unless the group is making a lot of dumb mistakes.
---
-I found some fights, such as LBRS's Vosh'gajin, completely easy as a priest who can dispel magic but a little rough as a druid still gearing up. Another tough fight was those shades in Dire Maul West, which are made much easier with a priest to shackle--and which put out a lot of damage. 
---
-Try to get in with a raiding guild that won't treat you totally as an innervate bitch. The last guild I was in had priests who managed their mana well. That said, the druid has better mana efficiency and can keep healing for a while, so often does innervate others. It's just really great to have a raiding team that isn't taking you along just for that. Your heals will generally be lower on the healing done meters than pallies/priests (not sure about shamans, because I've just played alliance lately), but your heals can be almost on par. By the way, my last guild also allowed one moonkin and a couple feral druids in our raids and did get through Naxx--so if you roll one of them, do pop out of form and bres/innervate when necessary. You will also need to help decurse.
---
-Hots aren't really too mana efficient like they became in BC. Just downrank your main heal to rank 4 and rely on that. Occasionally you will need to provide hots for tank situations where the tank is ready to get his butt handed to him. 
---
-I loved playing resto at end game BGs and grinded AV to exalted for the healing offhand. Stealth is your friend in BGs and you can flag-run--another plus. I liked healing BGs. Sometimes nobody wants to, and healers are needed.
---
-
---
What are Raid times? Loot type?
---
The raid comp that is popular today is made from guilds that have played/raided vanilla for 7+ years.
---
Nice try but no serious guild will inv a Enh shaman to raids. 
---
But dont worry there will be casual guilds for enh shamans to join.
---
I remember looking at playing a feral druid at one point. While you do get that trinket on horde, I believe pally blessing are a really big help in letting you get the most out of your druid. One of the biggest dps increases available to the druid is just pure stats, since weapon dmg is irrelevant.  So kings give you an upper hand there. While bow will give you more power shifts throughout the fights.
---
Your hit value was correct though (+/- 0.4, I haven't seen the formula they plan to use yet). Hit value from weapon skill is calculated differently from the rest
---
Dont know,  never played online.
---
And the 60 afk UD rogues that might come back at any time
---
That PvP plate gear though man. God damn.
---
IF and SW are both close to Blackrock Mountain?
---
Iconoclast, Surge, other notable guild names that have already been listed...

Please man, stuff like this can be answered by a quick google.

My search "Will I have to buy WoW to play classic"
---
My result "World of Warcraft Classic will launch in 'summer 2019', according to Blizzard. ... You won't need to purchase a separate game for World of Warcraft Classic, instead new servers will go live which will allow players to jump in (however you'll need to create new characters as everything is back to basics)."
---
Might try that, but the magic was always doing it with friends, and they stopped playing a long time ago. I'm also not sure if I want to, for me, gaming and not feeling very well has never been a good combo.

This is the pickiest reddit I've ever seen. Considering the amount of gatekeeping that goes on the only content we'll have are memes, repetitive questions from newbies, and the occasional blue post alert. I've been here since classic was announced and it's been a constant barrage of "not this conversation again", "youtubers suck", "not another podcast", "I hate polls", etc.
---
Started in MoP and I will definitely play Classic.  I am trying to find the motivation to play on a pserver now. I am level 4 but can't continue. I see the potential, I just feel like it is a waste of time to invest time on a pserver. 
---
Sure I will be slower for the leveling once Classic is released but I'll experience the real deal for the first time so I guess it will be better.
---
Oh I know, at the time I thought I was great. Young me is about to take the back seat!
---
You can use the first 2 raid tiers to level a Warlock to 20 and park him at AQ/naxx
---
Anduin. I always wanted to be a king
---
Yup! I also have a one handed and shield for running the flag!

Does anyone know if the first 10-20 levels is quicker solo or in a two-person group? Leveling via the typical questing path.

You are going to miss a lot of the vanilla wow experience playing without PVP. But it doesn't matter if that's how you want to lay the game. if you want to play the game killing only boars, you could do that too.
---
He specifically asked for undead classes, so his only healing option would be a priest.  
---
That said, Resto Druid and warlock is probably the strongest warlock combo on horde side.
---
It's worth looking for a guild before Classic launch: there are plenty of guilds who post on this subreddit every Monday and there are gonna be even more guilds recruiting when the beta rolls around. I'm sure if you joined a guild you would easily be able to find a leveling partner to play priest with, but you're definitely right about Hunter being a much easier solo class. At the end of the day I would just suggest you think you would enjoy the most.
---
Yes stick to pve.

My argument is Nightfall

Wrong sub, r/wow might be what you are after!

Awesome, thanks. I will definitely buy that tyr's hand when I get approval from the boss (wife). Awesome work!
---
1-10 is better solo. 10-20 is where many speedrunning duo's get back together to level the rest. Because of the EXP split, you are more incentive to kill *everything* in your path. I've seen duo groups do 1-20 in under 9 hours (1-10 solo in that case).
---
This comment is gold. I know most of my friends are going to bulk create 5 characters ASAP to reserve names. So in the 1:1 ratio, it will bork things up royally.

I loved playing PVP servers in classic, because even if you were outleveled, you could call in a friend and have a  good fight.  It wasn't till BC where 1 high level could come along and 1v4 you all in 1 hit each then fly off the second you called in your own high level.  Leveling will take longer, unless of course you level feral druid  (Omen of clarity is amazing btw), because with stealth you can pick your fights for the most part and have literally no PVE downtime (kill, heal, back to cat, rinse repeat).
---
Also it's one of the few classes that can escape a corpse camp with it's sprint and/or cheetah form.  You can also use your sea lion to skip out on battles near water, and...
---
FFS I thought I was decided on Paladin, but now I want a druid again.  :(
---
&gt; Why you don’t get projections: Multiple servers as most likely going to be open at launch. They are not instantly going to be ALL CAPPED within the same second causing these massive wait times you are, unrealistically, projecting.
---
It doesn't matter if they are capped or not.  
---
When you set up production systems, you either project for a worst case, max load, or you DIE on release day, because the project owner will roast you alive over a very small flame.
---
&gt;The system wouldn’t have to wait for a character to be COMPLETELY created! As long as the character creating process is started then somebody could begin the process of creating the opposing faction.
---
**HOW IS THE SYSTEM SUPPOSED OT KNOW WHAT FACTION MY CHARACTER WILL BE UNTIL I CLICK "CONFIRM"**?
---
You do understand that the character creation screen has a "Go Back" button, yes?
---
Your naive algorithm depends on the creation screen FINISHING, because it is only then that it can know the faction created.
---
&gt;Also, try not to be such a douche

I promise not to be a douce, as soon as you present an algorithm that actually works.
---
Sadly this is correct. LFG + lower difficulty trivialized the leveling experience.  
---
Not to mention the gold economy is insane. Mine one copper node, and you have all the gold you need until 60.
---
I think what he was referring to the 5 second rule. After not casting a spell for 5 seconds you begin to regen mana, even in combat. So what you would do: blow all your cooldowns immidiately like max rank fireball, fireblast, CoC and then just finish them off with your wand. This was in my experience a pretty bad way of leveling. What I do recommend is to carry a spirit set and equip it whenever you go out of combat. So you would have one normal, int/stam set for combat and another spirit set for out of combat.
---
Priests are good, but more than 3 is redundant.
---
Personally, I'd go 3 priests 3 shamans and 2 druids. Jam your melees into the groups with the shamans and you should be all set.
---
My gf wants to go mage and I want to go warlock.  I'm split between choosing what I want to do and choosing to go another class that will make it easier for us to get into dungeons and raids (not to mention save us from competing for cloth gear).
---
thank you very much ! thats the one i was searching for!

Hoping I can get to 60 in the first two weeks, but that's a stretch.
---
&gt;If player 3 in the que wants to play alliance the algorithm will account for that on a 1:1 basis for horde. This is probably the simplest problem to address...

I really cannot write this any bigger or more clearly.

&gt;it seems you just brought up the same invalid points.

The problem is not me bringing up invalid points, the problem is you not having thought this idea through.
---
Just last weekend me and my wife were diddling on a private server while enjoying some sangria wine, it's maybe 2am and she starts talking about how tired she is. I'm like god damn it were only level 6, I dont even get my hunter pet till 10 and she says "Weve been playing for 4 fucking hours, my life doesnt revolve around WoW!"

It's become apparent that there needs to be AA meetings for WoW addicts, not so I can get better but so I can pick up chicks and replace the Noob, I'll be the Jessie Pinkman of WoW addicts.
---
Everything mad season
---
you mean walking forward while drinking?
---
pretty sure that's just a quirk of private servers if that's what you mean. And it's more just a simple timing thing
---
If that's not what you mean IDK. Only thing I can imagine is timing your drink tics well so you hit them on the stack or something? But that would be basically pointless
---
Kek
---
Don’t need to get so upset over a harmless joke...
---
Why is it so much better than newer versions? Gameplay, graphics and other stuff improved so much. I mean u feel nostalgic probably but thats about it. It doesn’t bring any of these current good features currently being in, or am I wrong?
---
I mean this comes into the discussion of constantly evolving the game...but keeping things like max level at 60. Similar to Oldschool Runescape where they add small features to the game every patch without changing the dynamics completely. However, I do not think WoW has the flexibility to do this in WoW,  a new location means better gear. People obviously care about lore..but when it comes down to it, WoW is a game of progression, and that really is around leveling, gear, and professions. Its not like old school runescape where theres so many different aspects of the game (20+ different stat progessions)
---
Butters! You’re grounded!
---
Holy shit, 2/2 of your replies in your own thread are toxic as fuck. So much for being a protection Paladin
---
First month? What are you, a casual? I'm assuming you meant first WEEK.
---
I am. Just gonna go to work and play WoW for the first couple of months. My computer is a dust collector for the moment, but when Classic launches it'll prob pull up the temperature in my room with a couple degrees.
---
&gt;use common sense
---
That's what I would ask you to do, before you bless the world with more amateurish attempts at creating an algorithm with no regard for locks, timeframes, load, UX or even a remote understanding how the underlying UI works or when it passes what data.
---
That is an interesting take
---
It's wrong but interesting
---
But honestly, I'll be playing 18 hours a day. AT LEAST
---
because of the cost of BoE's, you really don't twink before you have a full level.
---
Loved my 19 Hunter.  Ran with 2 other 19 Hunter twinks.  So much fun in WSG.
---
Lmao well those of us without vacation time can't compete with that :P
---
I will be taking off Fri &amp; Mon regardless for a 4 day weekend after realease though.
---
I don't see why a 5man or raid wouldn't want both a warlock and mage. Great damage and utility. As for gear, yeah, that's something you'd have an issue with. I'd recommend just talking about it reasonably. If you're doing 5mans together, just alternate between loot drops. If you're doing raids together, something else will determine who gets what (rolls, loot council, DKP).
---
You don't want an immersive world
---
stay in retail
---
The whole point is all the game is interconnected. PvPing helps my PvE (for most classes anyway if you rank). Generating gold helps me in everything. Raiding helps me aquire PvP loot
---
If you want a game without conflict I suggest not entering a universe soley based around the conflict between humans and orcs...Because that's all this series ever was before WoW
---
Kel'thuzad because I get to be alone and barely anyone will be allowed to see me.

**&lt;Summerlin&gt; Hardcore Horde NA West Coast PVP**
---
We are now recruiting members with a hardcore mentality for Classic World of Warcraft. Our first goal is to level quickly and claim a **World Top 5 Ragnaros**, as such we are looking for people looking to level quickly and dive into end-game content as soon as possible. 
---
For long-term members we will have three primary requirements:
---
* Two raid-ready characters for split runs
---
* Rank 10 PVP on your main raid character
---
* 300 Engineering on all raid characters
---
We will also require you to have one summoning alt for world bosses, and one additional level 35+ character for transmutes.
---
If you're looking for a hardcore guild and think that this might be the experience you are looking for go ahead and send in an application:
---
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link
---
If you're not quite sure that you can be this dedicated to the game but still want to be competitive, feel free to send me a DM with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
Ah I didn’t know it was a private server thing. Yeah they were trying to explain that the game batches input like every 40ms and if you time your consumptions right that you can essentially walk and drink. But if it’s a private server thing then nevermind!!!
---
If you want books then World of Warcraft: Chronicle is a three volume book series written by Chris Metzen and others, released in 2016-2018. It explains the whole Warcraft story pretty well, and then you can dive deeper in to various characters or stories.
---
I actually find some of the repeats interesting. Once you sort through the ‘oh god, not THIS thread again’ posts, you find other opinions from people who weren’t here to reply before and sometimes have other opinions, insights, memories, etc.
---
I’d rather have active discussions, even if it is a repeat, than to check the sub again as is now my habit and find nothing new to read.
---
Not sure I know what the right question is then lmao.

Long-time retail player, but new(ish) to Vanilla. Started in Wrath and I've always wanted to play the game that wasn't really available to me by the time I began playing. I've raided every expansion at a fairly casual level with friends and the most hardcore/difficult content experience I have would be mid-to-high level Mythic Plus dungeons from Legion/BFA. I know that doesn't translate much to Vanilla, but it's the only indication I have of my experience. 
---
I'm planning on quitting/breaking from retail until I've had a chance to play through all of vanilla PvE. I've been looking for a guild group for a while now but all the people I know are planning on playing on PvP servers, which I do not have any desire to play on.  As far as Vanilla experience, I have done quite a fair bit of levelling/dungeons on pServers across almost all classes, but never did any serious raiding. Most of my raiding/M+ experience from retail has been tanking, with healing being a close second. 
---
In Classic, I'd like to main a healer, preferably Pally/Shaman (Depending on faction) but I could play a priest or druid if the guild needed one. On that same note, I know most of my experience comes from tanking, and if the guild absolutely needed another tank, I could level one if it was absolutely necessary. I'll be taking two to three weeks off at launch to get a main and hopefully most of an alt levelled and geared.
---
Hope I've given enough info, feel free to DM if you need/want to ask anything else. Looking to meet some new folks who are just excited about classic as I am
---
It's all about atmosphere, kinda weird I know, but I like this dungeon
---
I keep going back and forth on what I want to be. Hunter or mage is what I plan, but also wondering what faction I should be as well. If Horde I'm going Orc Hunter or Undead Mage and if Alliance then Night Elf Hunter or Human Mage.
---
I played ally in Vanilla and went to horde for BC and that's where I've been until BfA when I played that a little Alliance again. I never got the Horde experience in Vanilla, and didn't really get the whole Ally side either since I was new and kept changing characters to find what I liked. Granted I only hit 58 a week after BC came out then switched to Horde. Don't plan on changing this time though. Will main one of those two and use the other as an alt when I get time.
---
One big thing for me is I like the fantasy characters of the Orcs, Trolls, Undead, and Tauren for Horde. For Alliance you get the bitchin Onyxia quest which is playing a factor on wanting to go Ally, along with probably going on an RP server.
---
Just having a hard time deciding what I want to do. I have time I'm sure since we probably won't get it till July or August I have time to figure it out, but I keep going back and forth on what I want.
---
22 int probably....Your threat is directly tied to your mana.
---
I doubt 30 SP more useful than a few extra heals/consecrates.
---
&gt; So on an so forth.
---
Great, and what if Jimmy decides he doesn't want apple juice after all, but wanted orange juice as well?
---
Because, Jimmy can do that. He's got the option to click "Go Back" up until the very last minute. And a lot of people want to have the option to change their mind at the last minute, in something as trivial as a computer game.
---
And even if you somehow hypnotized a million people, and convinced them that they have to decide beforehand what faction to play, Jimmy still has to wait in line behind Mike, until Mike and Samatha both got their juice.
---
Your idea is dumb, simple as that, and the fact that other people who never wrote a line of code, never debugged a server application, never had to calculate load-peaks, etc. agree with you, doesn't make it any less dumb.
---
Theres no such thing as too many Office memes, I've seen the shit so much i almost know what theyre actually saying which is either funnier or sadder but Office is life. I'm stoked for [Space Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QgJR4pAPlE)
---
Super respectable achievement I'm mad jealous I can't take a week off lol. What class/race?
---
Id bring 1 enh/ret, 1 feral/bear, 1 spriest
---
If I were competitive, but not looking to have 15 warriors I'd shoot for a comp somewhat like:
---
3 Prot Warriors
---
5 DPS warriors (a Mix of 2h Fury and DW Fury) 8
---
5 Shaman Healer 13
---
1 Enhance Shaman 14 
---
4 Priest Healer 18
---
1 Spriest 19
---
3 Druid Healer 22
---
1 Feral/Bear Druid 23
---
4 Warlocks 27
---
5 rogue 32
---
5 mage 37
---
3 Hunters 40
---
(On alliance, swap the healer comp to 5 priest, 4 paladins, 3 resto)
---
I'd carry another warrior, 3 more healers one of each, another rogue, another mage and lock on the bench. A roster of 47-50. 
---
The 3 hybrid dps would be among my most consistent raiders, but in the event they arent here and another bench healer is, i'd let the healers choose among them who they want to fill the shadow/enhance/feral spot--if they have the gear and want the respec cost.
---
please keep making these holy shit
---
Do you want to be a water bot or a summon bot.
---
That is the question.
---
Thanks for the response! Appreciate it!
---
Taking my level 1 Human priest immediately to Darnassus and doing every Nelf quest to grind rep so I can grab a nightsaber. 
---
Early 20s I’ll probably head over to Westfall real quick for the blue staff but then it’s back to Nelf quests. I think you only have to Defias quests, not the People’s Militia questline to get it but I cannot remember for the life of me.
---
...Level 57 Night-Elf Hunter right behind him.
---
The guy above develops server side APIs for a living. The guy above makes 70.000 a year (that's Euros, after taxes) thinking about exactly such problems.
---
What is your qualification buddy?
---
Best spec is shockadin change my mind. Can tank and hold threat with holy shock and can heal and be a priest in plate and a warriors friend.
---
SoupaSoka on YouTube levels a warlock from 1-60 and documents the whole thing. I even enjoy his commentary while leveling too. Check it out, I think it might be exactly what you're looking for.
---
Holy shit I forgot about combo points needing to be spent before target dies.
---
Ohhhh nonoo that's how classic will work
---
There is a bug where you can just get it to give you the drink buff while walking in a straight line. 
---
The tic thing is real. Pain in the ass tho I woudln't even bother lol
---
You will not be mana starved with mana pots/dark runes

Even better
---
Andy Dweyer? Is that you?
---
Why you hef to be mad
---
I'm loving these posts today! We are all slowly devolving into andy this wait is killing us!
---
You're the guy that yells at everyone for not doing mechanics while actively standing in fire.
---
Personally, I will be on a PvE, preferably RP, server. I’m looking forward to the old school group mechanics, zones not being changed by Cata, dungeons, crafting my own gear and not wearing the same heirlooms all the time, finding people in the world and randomly grouping for quests, busy cities in Stormwind and Ironforge...
---
All of it nothing to do with PvP, all of it irrevocably changed in retail. Can’t wait for Classic. Listening to some of the old vanilla zone ambient music makes it worse, but I can’t stop either. I perhaps should see someone about that, but I won’t.
---
It's like driving a car though a muddy road to work every day, Blue Posts is a rainy day where all the mud and shit gets washed off but the longer we go without anything to talk about the more mud and shit gets caked on.
---
Find some dwarf in you!
---
Once you drink some it's easy to like anything.
---
&gt; dozens of totally meaningless meme-topics here. 
---
Oh like the people who are trying to beat a dead horse into making a non viable spec viable when there is an entire class whose function it is to tank?
---
And yet the masses are upvoting these memes to the top. So clearly there's an audience for it, whether or not you or I agree with it. Just downvote and move along. There's nothing really to talk about until Blizzard pops their head up from their cave and brings us new insights gleaned from the shamanistic ayahuasca-induced journey they're partaking in that is Classic development.
---
Yea my PC is basically a space heater. Luckily I'm in TX during the summer so I'll be sweating my balls of regardless. 👍
---
If you don't care about slower leveling yes you can level prot pally. and at some point around level 40 you can start aoe grinding, as Holy Shield helps a ton with that.
---
I would take a pally in any 5 man as a tank, of course I would prefer a Warrior or Druid. But Pallies can tank all 5 mans
---
"I don't have to take time off work???" *throws a fit* 
---
Basically me right now. If I cant book off release day because it took too long to get the date I'm def sick that day. This could possibly be a pandemic lol.
---
Having played the 2 hybrid classes, I think you’ll enjoy the raw power and through-put  that a warlock can provide, for raids you’ll be stuck playing destruction tho usually 30/0/21  due to the debuff limit. 
---
Warlocks have no problems putting out damage, the only think you would have to worry about is how much threat you’re generating, so other than that you should have no problems. 
---
As long as you don’t mind farming for soul shards before raids then I’d say go for it dude! In the end just play the what makes you happy.  What’s more important is finding a guild or group of people that have a similar drive and play style as you do :)
---
The fact that you have to resprt to lies, insults and petty attempts at sandbox-meanness, only confirms my victory over you. 
---
It was a pleasure publicly destroying your idea. Now enjoy your life in Trumptown, you deserve it :D
---
I really am chomping at the bit here. I see "bluepost" and "classic wow", and my mind starts racing. It's sad to admit but I'm a bit disappointed now that there is nothing.
---
*googles if mankriks wife is dead*

Shit. Guess I shoulda brushed up on my lore before committing to that comment. Oh well, at least it'd be an easy role to play.

I’m actually pretty happy about that.
---
This meme is so well done, it's incredible. And yea, I agree with Andy, I just want a release date. This way I can at least prepare myself.
---
Yes windfury will be a thing. Go 2H enhance and RNG kill things!
---
Amazing. I have an almost identical warrior I haven't touched since tbc!
---
I prefer memes over the upthintillionths idiotic "suggestion" on how to change classic to suit the need of some kid who thinks hes brighter than everyone :D
---
You can level as a prot pally. While tanking dungeons with a paladin isn't impossible, it's significantly more work for everyone involved. If you have an organized group, you could do it, but you will likely have much more difficulty with pugs. For what it's worth, Paladins have some of the best buffs in the game, and holy paladins are well received in both PvE and PvP. Good luck on your Paladin quest =)
---
Correct, with 1 mage going deeper into frost for winters chill
---
Want to hang around in actual cities or mud huts? Want to experience the real fantasy world with good quest chains and lore? Want to play with the best racials in the game for PvE and the best group PvP class aka Paladins? Then join the mighty Alliance and slay those green aliens!

You still haven't addressed the fact that you only get full flurry for one stupid level before you ditch it. This is most relevant point and you keep avoiding it. This is cherry picking since I said it in literally the same sentence as the main point. I won't say anything else until you address it. You can't compare lvl 35 talents to lvl 15 talents as an equal comparison especially when those lvl 35 talents will be irrelevant as soon as you get them...
---
The launch servers will all be high population.   The additional servers that come after when they realize they need them are a gamble.    
---
As long as your playing at launch u should be fine
---
ACKSHUALLY Kazzak is an Ered’ruin, the species usually called Doomguards. Dreadlords are Nathrezim.
---
You may get a spot for nightfall, hunters do a better job at it, but trust me, no hunter wants to be meleeing.
---
Vanilla is probably the best version of the game for playing a true hybrid style in pvp. Druid wpvp is pretty strong, you have stealth, absurd mobility, and can self heal. You are one of the hardest classes in the game to kill since you can always run away from any encounter. Your 1v1 is very good as well. In battlegrounds, youre either best served as a flag carrier in wsg, or defending flags in ab since you can stall caps for a really long time.
---
You need to always keep in mind in pvp as a druid that you need to be utilizing your whole toolkit. Even if youre focused on healing, youll still want to be inrerrupting with feral charge, peeling for squishy classes, or throwing out damage spells to down a priority target.
---
HOTW is not the only viable pvp spec, you can play balance with 11 points in both feral and resto to grab feral charge and insect swarm. Although i would say hotw is still the best all rounder.
---
Id reccomend looking up some stormx pvp videos, he does a good job of showing what druids are capeable of. Hope this all helps
---
Actually priest lvling is one of the better lvling processes. Obviously relative to hunters no, but relative to all classes priest lvling might be A tier while Hunter/warlock are S
---
Defias Highwayman. Deadliest in all the lands.
---
Eh, I guess I shouldn’t have said that. I personally didn’t *like* it but I’m sure theres optimal ways to avoid down time. It’s just not quite as easy avoid downtime as priest or Druid IMO
---
Have you seen [World of Roguecraft?](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw)  
---
That’s the main point of discussion in these videos.  Even without Cooldowns rogue is still one of the best if not the best pvp class in the game only losing to the occasional warrior but even then they can just avoid them.
---
With SM Ruin you end up buffing a bunch of abilities you'll never use.  I always preferred DS or MD Ruin because then at least you got some utility stuff with Imp. Imp and Healthstones.  Plus with DS and Fel Domination if you got jumped in PVP you could sac the void and instantly re-summon the succubus to give the fight a bit of a reset.
---
My brother and I are hoping to do a very similar path to yourself, but we are going to try to take off a few days either side of a weekend to try and get an extra 4 or 5 12 hour days in early on. 
---
Best of Luck Sleepy!!! Hopefully we both get there within the month!
---
I dont understand Blizzards hang up, RP servers dont have any special rule sets, it's literally just a PVE server with RP as the name so people who like to RP know thats the place to gather to do so. They wont be enforcing name restrictions with all the GM layoffs and auto bans like they did in Vanilla, they wont do it for Classic because they dont even do it now for Retail!                 
---
              
---
So all they have to do is Right-Click on the folder for a PVP server, Click Rename, type RP-PVP and stand back for the standing ovation and people scrambling to suck their dicks for listening to them.         
---
            
---
What the hell is taking them so long?
---
In my opinion, you'll probably be happier overall if you stick with the faction that has the character fantasies that you like. Also the Horde is just bad ass!
---
Horde clearly needs more. Paladin. That is all you have to say. Paladins are massively popular and they easily eat up several healer spots.
---
Not a good one though
---
I played horde all through classic up to cata..  I always wanted to be alliance.  When BC came out, I loved my little paladin, and I am excited to being able to play her again without all the silly retail paladin changes.
---
just some random goblin in booty bay, that place seems chill af on a pve server tho
---
But horde have Shamans or do they not take healer roles?
---
This is the best Horde vs Alliance comparison I have ever heard.  It is so true!
---
Yep
---
Good catch I was referring to his Title of Doom Lord and not his race =). Thanks though I fixed it.
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lord\_Kazzak](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lord_Kazzak)

Relive glory days as gnome mage or try something new and kill gnome mages as an undead rogue?
---
I'll probably be lucky to hit it by the end of the first phase
---
The hero we need
---
Shamans are nowhere near as popular. Yes, they have them, but shamans were really under appreciated in the early days. BC is when they went bonkers. I would guess at a 4-1 paladin to shaman ratio on most servers. Nothing to confirm this other then Shaman's are not the "Best" at anything. They are average at a ton of stuff, which people are not fans of. I LOVE shamans, but you can get by with 1 max in most raid environments.
---
Just call in sick. Tell your boss you have a serious addiction and that you must seek treatment immediately. It's not even lying bro
---
Q, W, E are movement. A, S, and D are bound to spells.  
---
 I have a mouse that has 12 buttons on the side so i use 4, 5 and 6 for my most used spells. 10-12 are usually unbound. 2 and 8 are very important spells since my thumb naturally rests on 4 they're easy to hit. 1, 3, 7 and 9 are spells i use but aren't spammed throughout the fight. so usually dots or procs or something.  
---
scroll up is a movement ability like blink, ghost wolf, sprint etc, scroll down is usually a CC of some sort. hamstring, frost shock etc. m3 is usually something like distract. probably a grenade for classic tho.  
---
D is always an interrupt.  
---
alt+d is purge/dispel  
---
\` is always a cleave or aoe of some sort.  
---
s is a defensive  
---
a is a cooldown of some sort  
---
alt +1 and 2 are usually trinkets.  
---
capslock is bound to something I don't use super often like lust or a big cooldown.  
---
ctrl is my push to talk in discord
---
Well, considering the release date evades us still i think most people can't answer. :(
---
That being said, if it lands during a good time, easy.
---
Calling alliance players gay is a form of homophobia.
---
I have the same problem, I cant decide between the 2...
---
I prefer taming beasts, but keeping up with food is annoying. Demons are consistent, so its pretty even for me on this point.
---
DoTs or autoshooting and big crits? I like them both equally.
---
I prefer Ammo
---
I prefer no deadzone.
---
Overall its tied and my choice hasn't gotten any easier. I leveled a hunter to 60 on a private server in the past, and I enjoyed it, so I have a good idea of what aspects I like and don't like. However I was planning on going Warlock for classic, the only things that deter me is the lack of aggro drop and I'm really not sure if I will like it at 60 since I've never actually gotten there on a lock before.
---
Overall, I just want to be able to hold my ground and beat rogues in open world if I get opened on, and quite frankly both classes can do it quite well (Warlocks would be slightly better but I would play orc hunter and undead warlock so again - evens out)
---
After they banned all of our Accounts for Modelediting, there is no reason to go back to Current Retail.
---
Lok'tar ogar means victory or death.  It appears you have chosen the latter.
---
That's why I'm leaning Horde, but if I go RP realm I found it easier to RP as Alliance.
---
Oh yes. It was super bad at launch when you had to go to each node yourself (such as if you want to go from A to D, you had to go A to B, B to C, C to D). Horde had pretty fucking long flight paths between many nodes to get to the places that mattered endgame.
---
Over 4000 gold, must be fake.
---
Carebear? No, no, no, no. When you roll Alliance, you don't get the lowest level dungeon included in your main city to introduce people to grouping. You also don't get the second lowest dungeon in your uncontested zone. For that matter, you don't get to stay in your uncontested Barrens until you're 25. 
---
Really, the best thing though is the entire Stormwind/Onyxia story that you haven't experienced yet.
---
I’ll check out Stormx. And that’s for the further insight on Druid PvP, in classic. I’m pumped now lmao!!
---
Amazingly theyre not the least race picked on the class, trolls are:

My friends decided to switch to alliance on me and it’s just something I’m not willing to do... what should I do?
---
Engineering for everything. 2 min pom pyro mage is amazing good fun to play. With the right gear you 1 shot people. Warlocks are strong too but not as much fun imo.
---
Jackie Chan Adventures is getting a new show. Let's make this happen.
---
Retail? Private server? 
---
A one bottom press macro isn't possible, but you can make a macro that will cycle through abilities if you spam the button
---
So you are saying Prot Paladin as Tank in Dungeons (=!= Raids) is not viable. 
---
Are you somewhat mad?
---
My understanding is that something like this is currently possible on Retail, although you would need to repeatedly activate the macro to use each spell in the sequence.
---

always used grid (now grid2) with mouseover macros.
---
Stormwind is like right next to blackrock mountain, so you don't need to bind at Kargath.  :)
---
Why?
---
Check out Kevin Jordan’s stream. He designed the classes of Vanilla WoW and had a hand in many other systems of Vanilla WoW. He’s also super chill, loves answering questions on stream, and is very knowledgeable about game design. His handle is Kevin Jordan.
---
I am in a private server I believe
---
Male
---
Lol as if I've decided, who know.
---
First it was going to be orc hunter, then tauren druid, then UD lock... Now I'm considering UD priest. I'll probably just fill with whatever my guild needs, since I apparently couldn't decide if my life depended on it.
---
Charging out of shadow meld
---
Okay thanks. Just learned about macros so I’m trying to learn bout them
---
Not even, most premades run one rogue on def and that's it, I know that the frontlines aren't a place for rogues, which is what I was trying to get at with my original comment.
---
Everybody just automatically assumes that I'm complaining about getting killed in mid, but what I'm trying to convey is the class isn't built for that and if you are expecting it then you are in for disappointment
---
Perhaps you can contribute something productive to the question at hand? No? Thanks.

I... Am not.... TIRED!!!!!!!!!

Goldshire Inn ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Month?
---
Casual.
---
If I didn't address it, I probably agree. I agree that flurry kinda gets eclipsed when you can respec for MS. 
---
My point is you act like Deep Wounds and impale are great talents. But then say that at lvl 35 you dont have enough crit for flurry? But you have even less crit to proc deep wounds at lvl 20 right? Sure you can imp overpower, but even then deep wounds does very little dmg. You call imp battleshout measly amounts of AP, but compared to imp rend or deep wounds its way better.
---
Yea I’m in elysium
---
First month? First week here!
---
&gt;September is basically Christmas
---
Too fuckin true.  C'mon July 16th!  I STILL BELIEVE!
---
You have not met Westfall chat yet :D
---
Yeah, the problem is the Allies on your server probably had to wait 90 minutes to run WSG.
---
Lol'd so hard at Dwight.
---
This is good quality kind stranger! I love it have my upvote
---
This is a good point. We see the planet in this cinematic
---
To give a suggestion of something they could do after Naxx and not take the "Classic" out of Classic.  Things that happened in expansions without trivializing other content.  Things that the original devs may have done if there was no expansion.
---
Yeah that’s a valid point, I never got that deep into raiding with my lock, he was always just my alt, but I just loved leveling the damn guy. Just slowly whittling down and out lasting my enemies. Always just floating at like 40-50% hp I never respected him out of affliction lol 
---
I just remember SM Ruin being the “de-facto”  raiding spec Back then so that’s why I suggested it to see if it interested him.  I do think that warlocks have some of the most flexibility tho when it comes to how they want to build, which is nice I wish more classes had that option
---
Mage is a lot better in bgs as a lock ull be an easy kill for warriors
---
A dwarf rogue? You should "DELETE"
---
wow, someone flexing on the internet. It really does feel like circa 2008 again.
---
Your "qualifications" are completely irrelevant, because you obviously couldn't understand the very simple process that OP described. OP described one thing, you assumed a different thing, and then went on a huge rant. Based on your other responses, you obviously aren't going to admit that you misunderstood OP, so there's really no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
---
I feel sorry for the people you work with, or, god forbid, manage.
---
You weren't worthy of the best race, shame.
---
Omg I'm loving these
---
Amen
---
Annoying if your goal is to level up quickly. Amazing PvP if you are just taking it slow and not worried about efficiency.
---
nah not at all, epic trinkets are very hard to come by when it comes to actually practical ones, right now on LH even my r14 war with thunderfury is still rocking 2 blue trinkets
---
For real lol, I think most of them didn't read all the way through my comment or maybe I should have wrote it better.
---
People acting like im saying rogues are trash, which isn't at all what I was going for, just wanted to throw some perspective in for people who aren't used to vanilla and aren't aware of rogues teamfighting ability (or lack thereof)
---
The music and the pop up sound effects from windows movie maker really immerse you in 2005.
---
Yes ull die a lot in pvp and pve . Pvp you are like the worst 1v1 class
---
Yes. If I recall it takes some finagling in the program files to get it working, but blizz may have fixed it with an update over the past year since I last played.
---
Hardest part is finding a authentic CD key if you didnt register an old one with blizzard.
---
How long did it take him?
---
Yep I'm going for the 4 day weekend strat as well. Gl to you bros and happy hunting!
---
on my first ever character, a dwarf warrior, i always used a shield because it had high armor. i tried leveling as a warlock but saw “80 armor” and i was like wtf is this on my warrior my shield gives 100 by itself, weak class
---
i miss those days
---
How do you know about my gross ass job?
---
Can't decide whether I want to play Holy paladin or Priest.
---
Both have sick armor, both are great for raiding, both are great in pvp.
---
Priest will be easier to gear tier 1 but paladin catches up really quickly and eventually kind of eclipses priest in certain rolls T2+
---
Tuuuuuna
---
Don't vendor anything, you could have lots of gold that you can turn into bnet currency from items no longer in the game etc
---
didn't know that. I plan on finishing Nax in the first month though so I'll pass
---
Ban this kinda shit
---
The queue could be after faction selection. So in a sense, two queues that get alternated. They would have to slightly alter the character creation process though.
---
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
---
cringe
---
Haha as long as you enjoy it it doesn't matter how long it takes, the grind is what makes it fun.
---
Honestly, PvP servers aren’t that bad. I’ve leveled up to 55+ on two private servers in the past year, and yeah you get ganked occasionally, but holllllllly shit I had so much more fun. And I’m someone who focuses mainly on PvE as well - the PvP is just an extra bonus. Really makes you feel safe when you’re in a home city, and adds an edge to the game when you’re out and about!
---
I don’t feel like this is an effective duo, but I have never tried it myself. Those are completely contradictory playstyles. Dots will be ineffective because the mage wants to burst and drink. Multi pulls with dots will be limited since the warlock will be doing most of the work. Not to mention the overlapping loot and, as someone else mentioned, the mount situation. 
---
In the end, its not like you can’t duo as Mage and Warlock, its just not synergistic.
---
Completely agree, but of all the classes only 2 of them are melee, and I think many people are forgetting how bad it feels to play melee in a ranged dominate meta in wsg, if you don't have a healbot you are screwed
---
I agree, but it's a Mage, not a Warlock. ;)
---
I have to agree, the horde are supper cool if you take in everything we knew from outside material  like how they came to be from Warcraft. 
---
But once you were in game, the alliance areas just felt soooo much more fleshed out, super immersive compared to the horde starting zones.   
---
The horde areas do look just a little rushed in comparison
---
&gt; I doubt bracket stack was a thing in retail vanilla, its a private server thing in my opinion, it should not work.
---
It may not have been a thing in Vanilla because people might not have known about it then, but the math should work out that if they tie their honor contribution together exactly, they would all get the same RP on rollover. Meaning that if they all tie for 1st they all get 13k RP. The breakpoint percentages wouldn't apply to them, because those are calculated based on the CP. If the CP is equivalent, then they'll all get filtered to the same tied rank.
---
It got razed by the orcs, so van Cleef and his guild of stone masons rebuilt it. 
---
Only to have Lady Prestor appeal to the greedy side of the Nobles who then denied van Cleef his remuneration. He then intended to raze the city once again.
---
Stormwind really is no safe place to be in.
---
Can't make out if he is saying beta or baited.
---
I find it telling one class is literally so overpowered it causes people to reroll and frankly I can't blame them as someone who has played both sides.
---
I'm banking on a July-Sept release but hopefully we get confirmation this month.
---
...really?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bl9yzf/looking_for_group_monday_may_06_2019/
---
I would do priest for the easier leveling to be honest. Plus Priests are just awesome!
---
&gt;What I do recommend is to carry a spirit set and equip it whenever you go out of combat. So you would have one normal, int/stam set for combat and another spirit set for out of combat.
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but this feels a little overengineered.  What benefits would an int/stam set provide in combat over a spirit set?  You're not gaining any meaningful DPS, and you shouldn't be taking enough damage as a Mage to warrant prioritizing stam.  Why wouldn't you just wear the best gear you can find with a bias toward regen?
---
Nice photo
---
From the image: 4 days 20 hours.
---
You have a gun to your head at the character creation screen...and you have a lot to live for...you have to pick a night elf or die...which class do you roll?
---
I would for sure have thought there were more troll rogues
---
Hopefully the second month
---
Horde
---
Alliance often has more pala than priest, they scale better outside fights where the raid needs to take soak damage
---
Can't double up on fort
---
Absolutely not. The whole point of Classic is to go slow. If I was going to burn through it, I might as well play on retail!
---
I'mm hit all the dungeons while they are relevant. Plan o get side-tracked on totally non-efficient quests that take me to the other side of the world. Farm low level epics. Gonna get ganked a bunch. The full experience!
---
I never said anything about imp cleave—its a junk talent. What I meant was more about pulls where you are forced to take on two mobs at once. You do the same thing as hamstring kiting with hamstring+heroic strike...except you’re using piercing howl and cleave.
---
I know plenty of incompetent raiders in guilds that clear all content, but maybe that bar is lower for you idk
---
Been using assist for a long time. Really useful in RBGs. Especially if the group isn’t using voice.
---
Hey Doc, hit me with the adrenaline IV. I need to finish this fuckin quest!
---
PvE servers should not exist as far as concerned
---
A lot of people will get to 60 in the first month.
---
Especially as a priest. You can bet they'll be filling the last few spots and looking for more heals
---
I found it really strange when Theloras went out of his way to shit on retail for an exploit that caused a boss to be soloable at the start of the expansion as if vanilla didn't have arguably the most famous boss solo of all times in it (by a paladin nonetheless).
---
Being able to do weird and ridiculous things is one of the things that made vanilla so memorable for me and I am sure many others (the infamous corrupted blood incident, kiting kazzak to Stormwind, etc).
---
Exploits like the one Theloras referenced, had it happened 15 years ago, would be fucking legendary but since it is in retail and a large chunk of people just decide to shit on everything about retail regardless of context it gets used as a negative.
---
Hunter.
---
When i first started playing wow and watched this video i thought this guy was crazy and overreacted. A couple of hundred raid hours later with people standing in fire over and over again he started to make alot more sense.
---
Lol!
---
Well both of these classes perform very well in both pvp and raiding, they also fill the same character niche or archetype. So you just need to provide a little bit more info on what you like or how you like  to play
---
Warrior main here, he's currently only level 80 because I didn't like the expansions. 
---
I did almost everything solo. Grind, pull an extra mob to test rotation and hp limits. Repair bills were brutal, grinding was slow, completing elite quests for upgrades didn't always happen,it was beautiful. I was always under geared. My advice, just pay attention. That solo time I had paid off big times in 5 man's. I paid attention for pats, I used LoS, I popped a heal pot as needed because I knew his limits. Truesilver chest and sword was a game changer for my solo play. But the real game changer was the wife started to play. Helped power level her druid to catch up. There was no stopping, tank, get topped off, pull a mob, get attacked by horde, get 2 hk's and kill off the mob aggro. I didn't roll an alt until he was 60. No other class I played after that gave me the sense of accomplishment that he did. It was hard, it was slow, it was one hell of a learning curve going into a 5 man blind and not telling the group, I can't wait to do it all again minus the blind factor. 
---
I know I'm rambling, but to add on to the pvp. I would always look for anyone healing and start killing near them, they will follow you and it's just ugly what a warrior can do when they know their character. I would spec mostly arms, add in some prot for the oh shit skills,a couple fury points and you'll be fine. Crit, skill imps, oh shit talents and befriend anything that can cast any heal.
---
Because of PvP. That's the only reason really. More survivability is just handy overall, you never know when it might come in handy
---
Well, after recently playing through Warcraft 1 and 2, I did notice a lack of story in those games other than go here, kill this.
---
I'm considering rp PvP or PvP myself.
---
Characters wouldn't matter; only accounts tied to a faction, so in this case, it would only work on PVP servers.
---
If a Shammy gets real comfortable weaving Windfury and Grace of Air and is ready to chug Mana Pots and Runes, understanding how there will barely be any loot for him in Tier 1.
---
I'd be willing to bring one along to boost the top melee group.
---
Nightfall is a bonus when considering it.
---
I'm a simple man, give me Office meme, I upvote.
---
I mean I am well aware of that as I played much more than most for all of vanilla and beyond, but it is actually incredibly unlikely that he would have any of the 5+ trinkets that are much better than that and at least one of which is also a blue.
---
WTF is the 123 point system?
---
Why is there a point system if it's loot council/
---
Hemit is my boy. He provides me the legitimacy I need. I tell everyone I am doing his hunt. Secretly though... Hemit knows why I am here. I didn't come out for no raptor flesh. I came out to hunt the most dangerous game.
---
I pretty much agree with everything in this tier list. All I would do is having Deadmines and Stratholme switch places with BRD and ST. You have good taste my man!
---
I am still trying to decide whether to go druid (resto at 60) or rogue as my main. My question is a little unique. I have almost always played a healer, from retail vanilla up through the expansions. I have played but not raided with dps alts, including a rogue in TBC. I'm most worried about switching from heals to melee dps in raid settings. I wondered if vanilla raiding is unkind to melee classes?
---
Pretty sure OP is a poor attempt at satire (or maybe trolling?), not actually a recruitment thread.
---
Well, if she changed her mind about faction, the next person would go and then she'd be at the end of the line for the new faction.
---
Darkshore is actually very easy leveling. It's long rather than wide so you can do one route for 4-6 quests at once and hearth back. Lots of packed mobs that you can farm and easy early greens from quests that don't get much more complicated than "go here and interact with X"
---
It could be used for progression. I'm sure anyone would gladly put the effort in helping the guild beating the next obstacle but it seems unnecessary to use it on farm status.
---
It's kinda downgrading, makes you take on the role of a cheerleader more than anything.
---
I've played warlock since tbc... I've played every class in retail and warlock is by far my one and only.
---
No way I'm going anything but a warlock in classic.
---
Warlocks are bae. 🥰🥰🥰
---
Good lord the new models are disgusting.
---
I feel like everyone exaggerates ganking. It happens, but it was never overly bad, even when people would camp. I still levelled fairly quickly, and battlegrounds will never compare to crazy world PvP!
---
I wonder how all this about camping vendors will be affected by sharding? Would it be a viable strat to camp an alt at a vendor and then join a party with ur main or a friend so that you 'jump shard' and such? If so the early time in classic (as long as they have sharding) might make for an amazing way to farm these recepies and sell on auction house or something. Does anybody know?
---
I don't trust nuBlizzard to make good content.
---
I agree but at the same time I don't think most people would be interested in raiding Naxx. It's very time consuming and usually the player base drops by the end of an arc.
---
My guild let me tank Ony and MC on my warlock, but that was only after we had farmed both of those into oblivion. A mage could probably have tanked them at that point.
---
Well I'm counting endgame dungeons and making a full on guess. The fact you named even less than 12 hammered my point home I guess. Thanks for the information.
---
Druid.
---
So true man, I spent all of classic as a twink, made a ton of level 19s!
---
&gt; You can not have that because it is unsustainable.
---
...so all the private servers running for the past 10 years were "unsustainable" ?
---
/salute 
---
Stay away from the devilsaurs if you're rolling RPPVP alliance cause I will show no mercy when I finally get there.
---
I think it worked out to something like a 1-2% dps increase overall.  I don’t remember where I heard that tho.
---
Well a war tank will just reserve truestrike normally
---
Retail bad
---
it still woulnt stop joe bob from making 10 horde characters the first time he logs in to reserve names creating the imbalance.
---
I'm really into feral druid and enyoing  tanking in 5-10 mans. In raids if im lucky i only see like 1 feral tank and never seen a dps feral.
---
I dont wanna heal in raid at all bcoz im just really bad at healing.
---
Do you guys think there is any raid spot for a casual dps feral druid?
---
Deeprun team as well as proximity to many raids.
---
So worried about having a successful game that they'll barely need to maintain once it launches
---
I love the nelf look but the way they hold 2h weapons will always make me giggle
---
Don’t live stream. You’ll tough it out. :)
---
Hahaha I think this is partially why I’ve almost always preferred PVP.  it has its frustrations, for sure, but man wiping to people standing in fire and then having to rebuff for an hour is it’s own kind of frustration.
---
interesting correlation between "do you have an active sub (72% - no)" and "have you played on private servers (70% yes)". PvP stats were awesome too.
---
Don't guilds try and take like 4-6 shamans for their totems? It's my understanding that horde almost never has enough shamans. At least not ones willing to heal.
---
Just as an FYI, classic Wowhead lists every item as having been added in 1.13. If you want to see correct "added in patch" data and item changes over patches you should check out [itemization.info](itemization.info).
---
Paladins are generally fine as 5 man tanks, particularly if you can solve their mana issues.
---
You need good dps though, that cc's out of consecrate range and doesn't pull aggro since paladins have no taunt.
---
Sorry bro I'd just bring another warrior not you, let's get real
---
I'll accept this argument about loot distribution for a druid tank....But he's actually getting loot. And enhancement shaman would be at the bottom of any sane/fair loot council. Scraps only
---
Don't bring up rolling on gud stuff, no one sane is gonna let you do that. If they're letting you do that you're in a raid/guild you don't wanna be in lol
---
They are worried it will kill retail.
---
Hi there! 
---
I've been using the [Classic WoW Survey Tool](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) to check all those questions regarding population numbers. Keep in mind that it's not perfectly accurate since the answer are based on what people said they *intend* to play, and that changes with time - the survey itself it's a few months old - but it's good to shine some light on the matter.
---
If you set the Filters to Only Horde, you get that 1123 people answered they will play priest. On alliance, 1252. That's a very small difference if you take into account that the number of alliance players is a bit higher too. 
---
In a more detailed approach to the data, priest players are 35.49% of all the healers of alliance, and 34.25% of the horde healers. So I would say that the Alliance really has a bigger number of healers, but not something that would affect the ecosystem of the faction.   
---
(And in my humble opinion this difference is mainly thanks to the fact that Priest Dwarfs are considered very strong and the faction doesn't have another healer class that has AoE heals, so it brings the value of a priest up.)
---
\---
---
Important detail to keep in mind tho, is that the data doesn't show *which build* each individual player will be using, so it's possible that a lot of shamans will play dps instead of healing, and this would raise the % of priests since there's not a lot of people leveling priest for Shadow. But I'm assuming the same would go for paladins in a similar amount, so for the sake of this comparison I'm ignoring that.
---
excellent reference
---
I'm dying. hahahahaha  
---
I still don't think logistically it'd work but the background check on this guy is hilarious.
---
Doesn't horde try to take 4-6 shamans due to their totems? So i's say shaman/pala both have about the same amount of slots taken up.
---
Yea I honestly see Classic and at some point BC/WotLK and possibly beyond legacy servers swallowing the current game. I think it will also drive sub numbers to the highest they've been in a long long time which at the end of the day is money for blizz and completely breaths new life into something that appears to be dwindling more and more all the time.
---
Literally just tried out a private server and have had zero interest in logging into retail since!
---
I sort my keybinds/hotbars according to the spell/ability type. This requires a 12 button mouse and WASD to move with the help of the mouse to strafe.
---
***Utility Bar*** **= Q, E, R, F, C, X, Z** 
---
The spell/ability I put in these key-binds are **Q** for racial, **E** for interrupt or Cure, **R** for taunts/slows, **F** for stuns or hard CC, **C** for speed increases, **X** and **Z** are flex depending on class.
---
***Main Bar*** **= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, -, =**
---
This bar is my primary rotation bar with the earlier keybinds being used far more than the later ones, especially in BfA.
---
**Secondary Bar =** **Shift 1, Shift 2, Shift 3, Shift 4, Shift 5, Shift 6, Shift 7, Shift 8, Shift 9, Shift 0, Shift -, Shift =**
---
With my left-hand pinky chillin out by himself, I figured I'd put him to use by helping me keybind with the left side shift button. The hotbar these keybinds are in are for buffs, heals etc. depending on the class. 
---
I also use Ctrl to modify more keybinds if need be but it is simply not required in BfA but will be used for Classic for sure :). Hope this helped, because for me, switching to this helped me get my first Cutting Edge achievement.
---
I was alliance before, but since there was a serious faction imbalance for the Horde I decided to go there to add my small contribution to restore equilibrium.
---
AFAIK Blizzard added the Blood Elves in TBC to the Horde for this reason.
---
This guy has a series of videos where levels an AOE prot pally and a druid, both to 60, at a casual pace. Super chill in every vid, even when getting ganked, and has some low key soundtracks in the background.
---
Don't know if he has a Reddit account, or if he even looks at classicWow Reddit, otherwise I would tag him.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/user/CaffeineInjected/featured](https://www.youtube.com/user/CaffeineInjected/featured)
---
Exactly, I’ve had endless fun creating 3 different characters on 3 different private server realms and levelling them up into their 40s/50s. It would be a beautiful thing to have that, only all on one account, and with dedicated servers that I know will never go down.
---
No problem! Oh, I did try to moonkin once in vanilla. It was just out of curiosity and to temp respec to offer dps in a dungeon. The term "Oomkin" was so right. I was used to all the mana regeneration on my resto druid and was spoiled by hardly ever having to drink. The mana efficiency and dps is pretty bad on moonkins. Oh, I've heard of a rare moonkin supserstar, but the best spec for utilizing all the arsenal of druid flexibility is probably heart of the wild, like mentioned above--cat dps is still viable for a warm body and you can also tank.
---
Umm yes and no lol, warriors and rogues just happen to be in the S tier of melee dps, so if that’s your concern I’d say don’t worry about it
---
They basically can start over and have one game for people like us, people with taste, and the “retail” game for everyone else. *im only half joking about being that elitist*
---
why would they be worried if the philosophy of retail and classic wow are complete opposites, consequently attracting two completely different audiences? :thinking:
---
Autorun and autorub
---
Their stealth was that good
---
I think you mean "arrow keys".
---
It has been a memefest since it was made. Can't really blame people for posting a bunch of cringy stuff when there's not much else to really post about except the 900th speculation thread. Plus lets be real, forums are gonna die down a lot once classic releases anyway.
---
Hunters do more dps late game than druids or shamans.  About 20% more I think in terms of late game PvE scaling.
---
Hunters and druids are far more powerful and versatile than shamans in PvP as well.  Druids are undisputed amazing flag carriers and point holders in AB.  Hunters can also hold points from range extremely well and are really pretty hard to deal with in PvP overall.
---
No I'm on a regular PvP server and you're lucky, because I'm in a like minded guild we'll be fucking up any horde who try to mess with devilsaurs until our entire guild is outfitted with devilsaur gear which means you'd be SoL for a while :p
---
As a dwarf hunter I can say that I knew this.
---
WHOA what a woke take.... holy s#!t
---
Roguecraft was way before 1.12 when they actually were OP.
---
i've been there recently
---
You should probably also look at how many of the other healing clases on each faction will be rolled, and how many people rolling those classes will actually heal. If there's an even amount of priests on each side but horde has less shamans/druids, they may end up taking more priests and vice versa for alliance.
---
I'd do the work myself but I'm on mobile and can't figure out how to filter on mobile.
---
It's not all my deaths, far from it !
---
I think I made an album of the recurring PKs to remember who to target first once 60.
---
Geraldo good
---
Incorrect.
---
http://www.wowpedia.org/Castsequence
---
I think it's more like having to admit some people in there suck at their job, it's never pleasant for anyone.
---
Not to pick on you, but I see this all over and it makes zero sense to me.  What motivations do they have to prevent Classic at this point?  The cats out the bag, we're going to get it it's just a matter of when.  There may be some developers/leads that want to save face and see classic fail, sure. Anyone in a position of power should be elated that they're going to be able to milk classic again though, it's basically free money for them once it comes out.  They don't have to worry about adding anything to it for years (if ever).
---
I'm saving that for when I level my second character, I just want an established main ahead of the pack ready to PvP &amp; raid when the time comes.
---
Posting your own tweet?
---
It didn't work in patch 1.12 vanilla, so it's almost certain it won't work in classic as that's the build they are basing it on. There are video and patch note proof out there that this is the case
---
Except classic doesn't directly compete with retail, they're both owned by Blizzard.  If you play either one Blizz still wins out, who cares about a few people's ego
---
Hunter Druid would be fast as hell
---
Well, currently, there isn't quite a game like vanilla wow besides private servers, so players who may enjoy retail now might like classic even better and switch over. This turns them from potential microtransaction users into people who won't be using microtransactions.
---
The way macros work is that it follows the order of events you lay out. So every time you hit the button it first sends your pet to attack (that action doesn't activate the Global Cooldown), next it starts casting Immolate (which does activate the Global Cooldown). Since immolate activates the Global Cooldown the macro can't do anything after that point that is on cooldown. The reason it only ever casts immolate is because that spell does not have a cooldown so it should be castable everytime you use this macro (unless you try to cast it during the global cooldown).
---
You need breaks and if then macros. Lines in the macro that tell it if x debuff is on the target move on to the next spell. It's only possible in retail from what i understand because i think macros didnt have the same commands, but you wouldnt need it on classic because rotations are simpler. I had several of these written for rogue and warlock in earlier xpacks but I'm not playing bfa so I cant give you a newer one.
---
Well I’m torn on this too, feign death trap and drink stealthed is the only advantage besides camping in stealth.
---
If downing Rag the first week of release push you back in the semi-hardcore camp, I wonder what's the cap for full hardcore ?!
---
Nice troll :D
---
Are you gonna be one of them?
---
Try to pull one pulls 5
---
Maybe this was just a product of there being more priests than shamans on p servers. But people were not running that many shamans. 
---
It's just not a very popular class, add only resto shamans invited to raid
---
Melee is very good in vanilla tho. So if u had 15 warriors in raid yea ofc you gonna be bringing a lot of shamans for them and the rogues. IME tho priest will be the main core
---
Take off your rose-tinted glasses!
---
considering you can pull 15-30 raptors and aoe them from lv 48~ in Ungoro, getting tons of world blues that sell for 150-250g is not bad at all.
---
I found a warden staff.
---
I'm gonna get the papers-get the papers.
---
I use a controller and play in my living room.  I've heard that means I'm bad.
---
Okay so I should just click the buttons for my rotation and not even try to use a Macro?
---
Dude, I am done discussing anything about this, ever since the OP started spewing his racist BS at me. All left for me here, is to report the thread and move on.
---
Dps shaman will not he using stormstrike, as the debuff is 100% not worth overwriting other, more important debuffs. 
---
Let’s be real, if you’re in a even semi serious guild they won’t be taking you on any progression raids. If you’re in a casual guild, they are often short on healers and need more to cover the potential lower skill and gear from their raid members. 
---
Either option, you’re going to be last in line for most loot. You will never get a DFT unless every warrior, rogue and hunter in your guild already has it.
---
What a great segue for MTX in classic...let's hope not
---
What realm did you play on! We may have played together!
---
I've been using QWES for FPS's for decades. Carpal tunnel can suck it.
---
I think they should name the servers based on Diablo and Starcraft characters just to fuck with people.
---
I'll just be getting back from vacation in late August so fine with me
---
Great news, looking forward to it! Hope Kevin is feeling better soon. I could brew him some Thistle Tea for that voice of his..maybe Slice and Dice some fruit for him...just sayin'
---
Haha nice, I don't have a guild yet but will probably group up with folks along the way. Gl and happy hunting!
---
Younger me who didn’t make it past level 40 loved deadlines. I literally ran it non stop until I couldn’t get experience from it anymore.
---
Well it’s Twitter so I probably didn’t explain myself fully in 280 characters. Basically while listening to all the reasons they were keeping features out, it struck me that creating a game for people who like these features is in direct contradiction to the game they have now. So my point was that I understand why they pushed back for so long. 
---
So my whole point was that I think I see their perspective on this a little better.
---
I’m gonna be the outsider here, but the most populated realm could only be named:
---
Metzen
---
Move: QWES       
---
Jump: space      
---
Rotation abilities: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, R, F            
---
CC/Slows: D, A               
---
Long Cooldown: Z, X     
---
Mount/movespeed: C,V      
---
Utility: B, T (usually potion)      
---
Defensive CD:G       
---
PvP Trinket: `         
---
AA/Macros/Items/Buffs: Side panel of 6 button mouse, also have +shift for these         
---
AOE spells: middle mouse+ MB2&amp;MB3        
---
       
---
I play pretty much all classes so I just try to have a logical placement of similar abilities so I can hop from one to the other.
---
Here's hoping they expand to TBC once classic proves a success. I bailed on retail a month after BFA, but hopeful to start fresh in classic.
---
Then the even more skilled guild will clear MC/BWL/Ony in one night within 2 to 3 hours.  As long as you come prepared and have an open evening to raid once a week, the semi-hardcore/ hardcore guild may be the way to go.  
---
The super casual guild will be clearing MC in 4+ hours while bitching about DKP and wiping and you’ll be wishing it was over already.
---
I can't decide between Shaman and Paladin. I want to heal endgame pve content and pvp in bgs a lot. I've heard that Shamans are very strong in pvp bursting with 30/0/21, but I've also heard that they're very complicated because it's always important to get the right totems down and micro well. On the other hand, I've heard great things about the survivability of Paladins (S tier if I find a nice warrior friend) but they're kind of brain dead/holy light spam. Is anyone familiar with both classes who can explain how braindead pallys are vs how mechanically intensive/complex shammys are? Thanks!
---
My biggest thing is I want to world pvp and just have fun with people doing so. I never made it past 20 in classic. 
---
Mage: I used to play this, but it's so over played and I don't want to get bored. This is my last pick right now. 
---
Rogue: I like the idea of stealth and world pvp. Again it's over played is my concern... 
---
Warlock: It sounds cool because it's like a dark mage. It was the first character I rolled but didn't make it past 10. Not sure how they will do at WPVP
---
Priest: Everyone seems to say priest is a good option, but I am not sure how good this is for WPVP.
---
Of course we don't care, which player would, but people doing their jobs do.
---
 S Tier: Blackfathom Deeps, Shadowfang Keep, Stratholme Undead  
---
A Tier: Zul'Farrak, Sunken Temple, Blackrock Depths, Maraudon, Scarlet Monastery  
---
B Tier: Wailing Caverns, Gnomeregan, Deadmines, Razorfen Downs, Razorfen Kraul  
---
C Tier: Scholomance, Dire Maul, Ragefire Chasm, Stratholme Living, Uldaman  
---
D Tier: The Stockades, Lower Blackrock Spire
---
Alright. I'm gonna make a separate post now. Dunno how long it'll take to write, but it's coming!
---
Thanks, I like big bursts of damage.  I was looking a bit at Presence of Mind in Mage and Conflagrate in Warlock. 
---
I'm not super interested in having a summon but its not like its a deal breaker either.  I'm just looking for something to chuck spells at enemies as I played a Paladin in Vanilla back in the day and want something totally different and Warlock and Mage seemed to fit the bill.  Seems they are more alike than I initially expected.
---
That's actually a good call. 
---
I did *half* of what you said. I checked the [quantity of other classes](https://prnt.sc/nm63sm) that had healing specs, but not the people that claimed they will heal. I overlooked the "which role you'll play" option.
---
 I'll be busy for a few hours now, but I'll be sure to return and look better at the data as you suggested as soon as I have the time. 
---
Thank you for the shout-out.
---
Don't have to deal with paladins in pvp.  Fuck paladins
---
I'd rather die, thank you.
---
Other way. Always an alliance hunter/druid 40-60 hunting down horde levelers.
---
They already fuckin made it
---
I wonder if there's a table for base threat% caused by various classes and spells. Google hasn't turned anything up yet but I'll bet it's out there somewhere...
---
Remember my guild master laughing at me asking for like 10 nexus crystals. He still gave them to me, cause he wanted us to get our guild name everywhere. Had a 39 Twink Hunter Named Omgbigfish.
---
Meh. I am on pservers too. Maybe you get lucky. Also, Hunters level faster than rogues. I had to leave 2 different quest areas today because 60s were there doing quests for some reason. I am level 53 currently. PvP servers may not be bad for you but I hate them. I am only on a pserver because its all I have right now. When Classic comes out I won't be on a pvp server. I can't wait.
---
About tree fiddy
---
Ever thought about a druid?
---
Me too, except guarding STV Horde levelers.
---
We could hang out! :DDD
---
my 39 hunter could beat most melee classes.
---
**try** is the operative word. Apart from a few top guilds, they take whatever they find.
---
The market will bear what the market will bear.
---
Those tabs are a nice touch. 10/10 quality shitpost.
---
Whats the rules on rested XP on speed runs? 
---
Obviously Joana didn't do this in one sitting and accrued some rested XP. I would think you can do this significantly faster if you do it over a much longer timeframe with almost 100% rested XP utilization.
---
Twitter and I took it given the context that it's already being worked on. That's fair though, it probably is why there was the initial resistance as the two continue to be further and further apart design-wise.
---
Ah, I see. That makes more sense. You wouldn't be able to spam it though since it is high rage cost, but that could make for an engaging playstyle.
---
I still stand by the importance of practicing stance dancing while leveling since it is dozens of hours potential practice. If you disarm your mob or pvp opponent for 10 seconds, you don't need to kite.
---
Either sell to vendor or stockpile for a couple of days/weeks, until the speed levelers earned enough gold to power level their chosen professions.
---
So we're basically saying the same thing, got it.
---
https://imgur.com/zANkb3i
---
I was always a Horde player so I only ever ran the Alliance dungeons once or twice solo at later points in the game, by which time they arew underwhelming.
---
Fair enough! I'll only have time and energy for one guy. :D
---
Why do you care so much
---
At release I don't think there will be any chance for anyone to sell stuff on AH, people will barely have enough money to pay for their abilities.
---
Vendoring stuff early on is better, 16c ould be a loss since you're not counting AH cuts. True that people on retail are "capable" of selling stuff even lower than vendor price, but still.
---
You can take up to 8.  At the least you want one for every melee group.  The more shamans you bring the less priests/Druids you take.  6 shamans 4 priests and one Druid seems to be the best.
---
Blaze it
---
Weird extreme stance to have when playing an mmoRPG and caring about your faction lol. If you don't have some RP in your heart why do you need to be convinced of any faction, race, or otherwise? Just play what your guildies need.
---
U cant mean mine...
---
What spec were you? If you don't mind me asking, it's really cool to hear from someone who's actually done it!
---
King Varian Wrynn because I belong in jail.
---
I'll be clearing Naxx day 3. Easy. 207 hours a day.
---
Obviously just my opinion... 
---
Vendor your leather. Save herbs/ore for later (to sell when people have more money... economy matures) and/or use it to level professions. 
---
I personally wouldn’t touch the AH with my leather/herbs/ore until later UNLESS it’d be something highly sought after (devilsaur leather).
---
That's adorable!
---
 &lt;Suboptimal&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Hardcore   
---
   
---
Schedule: Split Raids (Sunday 11 AM EST) (Tuesday/Thursday 7:00 PM EST)    
---
Introduction: We are a small guild coming over from the private server scene, that plans on being hardcore PvPers through the first few raids, and hardcore PvEers through AQ and Naxx. We have a dedicated group of officers and GMs that have all have years of raiding and pvping experience in Classic. We love really good players and new players that have a lot of drive.    
---
PvE Plans: Suboptimal is looking for try hards and social players to join our ranks. We are a guild dedicated to promoting a chill atmosphere while still crushing all of the content. We plan on downing rag in the 3rd or 4th week, downing Nef in the first week, everything in aq(maybe not C'thun) in the first week, and progressing through Naxx at our own pace for fun! If this style of guild interest you please hit us up.    
---
PvP Plans: With ranking coming out in phase two, we are going to be running a bunch of PvP specs through MC/BWL while still clearing it. Almost all of our officers and many of our core members plan on ranking between 10-14 and all plan to do it before AQ comes out, where the guild will shift more towards a PvE focus, but if you are a hardcore PvPer and like to win, you are going to want to be a part of our premades.   
---
Expectations: We will have different ranks with different expectations, if you are a raider or a core raider, we expect you to show up consumed and know your rotation curses ect which will be assigned from your class officer. As a social or member of the guild we have some guidelines laid out, but pretty much just don't be a jerk.     
---
Discord: We are going to run everything through discord to keep it super simple for our raiders and PvPers alike, so no digging through or signing up for websites and all of that.  Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!   
---
[https://discord.gg/6JrAMPq](https://discord.gg/6JrAMPq)
---
If your goal is to just enjoy content and play the game...do both man. The game is going to be out for a long time. I plan on playing a priest, hunter, and druid.
---
True, everyone has their preferences! I’m just excited to finally play on a legit server
---
Yes, i did. But the more i read about it the more i was put off from considering it, from what i read their healing isnt great, they can provide mana though, their damage isnt great either, balance runs out of mana but feral can kinda tank? I dont really wanna tank though :(
---
Lets assume you are right and the game turns into the second coming. As long as Activision is around, they will find a way to ruin it. I sometimes wonder if succeeding with something around Activision is even a good thing. Maybe it would be better if it doesn't get too big.
---
I remember being on some really long MC raids back in the day. They could easily take 8 hours back then because half the DPS was either lagged out or AFK making a sandwhich. The people who were awake and paying attention most likely weren't spec'd correctly and gear wasn't itemized properly until later patches. That isn't what it will be like in classic.
---
Pretty much everyone has better internet these days and it'll be easier to keep track of people who AFK. Gear will be in it's 1.12 state and there are guides all over youtube about how to spec.
---
If you have 40 conscious players and some gear from MC a full MC clear will take about 2 hours.
---
Click can be your frost shield?
---
Have her grind mats for you
---
Hmmm. Normally I don't get on people for these types of threads... but there is quite literally a stickied thread today called "What Should I play Wednesdays" dedicated just to this exact dilemma....
---
They are very important especially early in the server, and profitable. Probably unattainable 
---
the likelihood of you getting them all is basically null unless you have many alts doing many raids and some how get people to give you these rare BoP schems for your alt. And vanilla is not all that alt friendly as the patches go on
---
Some obvious huge schems that are difficult to get
---
Alchemy - flasks, worth easily 1k gold even on a young server. This one you can get all recipes prob
---
Blacksmithing - arcanite reaper is the first big one, OP 2h found of a rare elite in a dungeon, can make some money crafting that early. Lotta raid stuff here late game, no way you get all the blacksmithing. 
---
Cooking - This one is easy 
---
Enchanting - Harder to get but possible. Seen people do this one. Very difficult while trying to get the rest done too tho. Drop from raids
---
Engineering - there is a scope and maybe some other things from raid? That one will be difficult by virtue of there being many many engineers out there and it comes from raid. 
---
Leatherworking - I can't think of anything that drops from raids but I'm sure it exists. Rest is pretty low demand and easy to buy if necessary. I think there are rep grinds
---
Tailoring - I think this one you can get em all pretty easy. Some rep grinds but not too terrible
---
Maybe some rep grinds i forgot to mention on the others too
---
If you really enjoy crafting you should try to be the enchanting guy who sits and makes money off your massive collection of enchanting mats. Then go spend your time on the AH or something. You can collect most everything and be self sufficient. But there will a few things you need to reach out to others for.
---
Keep in mind this is one of numerous replays of the same VoD. The stuff on the video happened like, back in actual Vanilla.
---
So if you look at the title of the video, in the picture... ...
---
You are right. I haven't actually read what he wrote. :P Better do that next time. :)
---
man I'm crying lool are you me ?
---
If you don't really care what race you are, dwarf.
---
Im glad i made it on the right day, would have been embarassing if i posted it tomorrow! Or yesterday!
---
&gt; It got razed by the orcs, so van Cleef and his guild of stone masons rebuilt it.
---
Ohhh yes I saw this story somewhere recently for the first time on Reddit somewhere. Very interesting!
---
This is my favorite take lol
---
I think it depends on if you're tanking mostly congested mobs and areas. Generally pretty sure spell damage beats everything but on a single target something else may pull ahead.
---
Hang out in duskwood
---
It basically depends when it releases but in any case I will be 60 first month.
---
If I can take vacations I will play something like 16+ hours / day which would put me at lvl 60 in about 9 IRL days, but if I still have to go to work I will do 6 to 10 pm Monday to Friday and 2x12h the week-end, a bit more than 3 weeks.
---
Hemet Nesingwary
---
u wanna melee dps? 
---
rogue
---
can also play cat druid if you tell them you wanna go farm crowd pummeler (google it). But that's a lot of work to play a very mediocre spec. DPS whores will love the extra buff tho
---
if u wanna heal go paladin. if not don't go paladin, it has very little to offer from a dps perspective on 1.12
---
Once you are full best in slot, you chase alliance/horde everywhere! Make them suffer.
---
Hunters are a lot less versatile than Shamans, plus shamans are much better in group pvp
---
Those videos would be relevant if classic was going to be 1.0-1.10.
---
By the time 1.12 came out rogues were probably the weakest they had ever been relative to other classes.  They were much closer to balanced and most classes had a really good shot at killing them in pvp.
---
Thank you&lt;3
---
Ill say this.. Play Whatever the \*\*\*\* you want. Because Wow back then is going to be Played a lot differently now then back then.. Back then people Still clicked Spells, Ran Aimlessly in the world and were still learning the Game. for example. people will follow a Direct "quick Questing LOG" where the know Exactly what to do and exactly where to go to level. So when it comes to Raiding im sure you will see more classes in certain raid spots/ PVP that you didn't in actual vanilla Since we All know the Fights and We all are basically Experts on the game now.
---
Yeah maybe so.  Retail may be shit (not arguing for/against), but IMO classic's success doesn't implicate it either way as they're totally different games by now.
---
So it sounds like you want to play a class to top the dps charts? This would be: rogue, mage and warrior (at a later stage though). Druid in cat is viable for the massive leader of the pack buff but won't top the charts.
---
Yeah what the hell is that? Type it out again for reddit sir.
---
Look it's funny but we don't need to see this meme 3 times every day for the next month \^\^
---
Haha that was the best
---
Possibly yes, but this particular speed run was a server first too Aswell so if he spent too much time resting he would’ve lost his gap ahead of the rest of the people. You can see in the Vod’s he’s always getting messages like “Wow you’re already level so-and-so” always a good time watching that run no matter how many times you’ve seen it.
---
Did you take my Mountain Dew?
---
Roast you, why? I won't even invite you.
---
Humans are going to be tops for dps in raids.  The expertise will also help a lot with tanking.  
---
In non raid settings there is probably no appreciable difference.
---
In PvP nelf may be favorable because you can charge from shadowmeld, which is always a pain to deal with.
---
I never knew if that npc's name is pronounced "Remy Remy" or "Remy two times"
---
lol ... okay then.
---
I would suggest you play either Death Knight or Sith Inquisitor.
---
There are spreadsheets out there with vendor pricing of things and what price u need to buy the mats at to turn a profit.
---
People know exactly what will be needed for raid so I would expect people in the know to buy out all the good stuff and prices to quickly rise. But we'll see. 
---
Maybe people will just throw elemental earths and devilsaur at us for 5s a piece who knows
---
I'm with you (esp ST and BRD. Big dungeons need love too!) other than Scarlet Monastery in C and Uldaman in B. I haaaated Uldaman and SM is probably S for me.
---
Yeah, OP's idea may seem somewhat reasonable on an opening day prospect (I'm seriously not going to get into an argument about the logistics behind anything, algorithms, queue times, etc.) BUT we have to think about long term with this 1/1/1/1 idea. I just really think this would be an annoyance on a big scale after a while. I mean... in 6 months when servers are matured and I want to start playing for example I would have an unknown amount of time potentially for a brand new player to start on the other faction. 
---
What if there are 50 people wanting to join horde and no body alliance should we start forcing? WHAT IF Billybob popular streamer is playing horde on this server? My friend plays on that server but I have a 600 person queue to create a horde toon because everyone wants to play on the same server as Billybob and no body wants to play alliance against his pro guild. 
---
I know there are a TON of guilds already formed with 200+ members waiting to pick a server and create their guild and get going. That's already gonna bottleneck and fuck queue times right away. Theres just so many variables that this doesn't account for and Blizzard will 100% not go with. It's simpler to let it play out and look back in 4 months and see the hailstorm certain servers became and allow free transfers to even it out.   
---
This just honestly will cause a lot of unnecessary problems just from that simple perspective, non IT related.
---
Doesn't troll self heal also add aoe threat?
---
It's kinda bitter sweet isn't it.  On one hand it awesome to have Classic and on the other we know the current leadership for the company cannot handle this level of production so what happens when this is popular?
---
I agree with you, likely nothing good =/
---
I will see you on the field of honor.
---
My man. (Except for what you did to WC can't forgive that 😡)
---
I've actually seen more of these posts then the ones it makes fun of.
---
This is the vanilla content I long for.
---
Bahaha "/r/classicwow, no the game isnt out yet" fucking perfect.
---
Honestly this shit is the only thing keeping me going at this point.
---
...That and of course autoplayed no-info youtubes, each roughly 10:32 in duration, just rolling in the background for ambient sound.
---
There might be something to that "topping the charts" I mean high numbers are fun. But i think its also to do with finding spots easier. I will want to be able to go raid with my friends.
---
I hope Space Force is half of what Office was. Can't wait for that either.
---
Yes, my favorite take is also my own take.
---
Remy "Two Times".
---
As in when he gives you the goldust quest, I imagine he'd say "get me the gold dust, the gold dust".
---
Getting a little tired of a niche crowd in this sub trying to force Blizzard's hand to develop RP-PVP servers and constant reposts/spamming here with these posts every week. I am not against RP-PVP servers, but if you have just one, then people will want one in every time zone. Why not just see how Classic population distributes out and sustains with the regular pvp/normal realms in each time zone before making these demands that could just water down realms more than they need to be, in terms of population?
---
Its hard to continuously work on something, assuming you are improving it, for 15 years, and then be told that the first iteration was the iteration everyone desires. 
---
I get it. But it doesnt change the fact that the first iteration IS the best one in this scenario.
---
LOL!
---
Mana updates every 2 seconds, so if you time it right, you can walk forward, and then stop, drink, receive the mana regen for 1 tick, then continue walking. Repeat.
---
so much as in willing to comment while i listened?
---
i mean my level of caring is presumably not that much higher than yours. I can only take my crusade so far. Although if i thought it would be effective in killing ret paladins on NA servers I would consider slightly more effort intensive measures lol
---
I'm gonna have to deal with these people. If they all kno ret paladin is bad by time classic launches i'll have done us all a public service. 
---
They will be on my team in BG's
---
Did you forget to log into your sockpuppet account or something?
---
I don't blame him. He is asking a specific question on what is best for the role that he will be playing and some ape comes along and starts trolling. I'd be "toxic" too.
---
I’m stuck on if I want to a roll a shaman or not. I don’t have a problem healing in PvE as I’m looking to raid seriously but I want to hybrid spec PvP. 
---
I know main set pieces carry over but competition is gonna be tight on spellpower gear.
---
If I took hearing seriously, how long before I could actually pvp as hybrid???
---
Why do you think dps shaman isn't going to be a thing. I can't stress this enough, play whatever you think will bring you the most enjoyment. If topping charts is what you live for, then yeah, probably wouldn't recommend a dps shaman but if you want to blast people with lighting or get those sweet rng 2h windfury procs by all means go for it.
---
Just find people who will play casually like you and they won't care what spec you are. You will 100% have a better time and contribute more to your guild/raid by playing a spec you enjoy and play well vs feeling pigeonholed into something that may do more damage but you don't have as much fun playing.
---
This is FAR too much emphasis on what is "viable" and the emphasis should be on what is fun.
---
You have to hit the button once per spell cast instead of one press and fire entire rotation.  So not incorrect.
---
Jailbreak quest line alone is worth leveling at least 1 alliance character
---
As cadhik write a bit after me: I don't think raid setups will be the same in classic compared to the one-sided dice we had in vanilla. Guess there will be more focus on the buff situation than simply taking a look at which classes are topping the charts in order to invite 7 of them.
---
It's probably a troll comment but, on lightshope beast/elemental Slayer increases the dmg of your spells by the amount stated. Most likely a bug, but, if it does work keeping a wep with the enchant on might not be such a bad idea. (+6 per ticket on consecration,+6 on white hit,SoR,JoR,Holyshield/block, etc... Also applies to procs of your weapons and any +dmg items. There's some gloves that add+4 fire dmg to your autos, in this case they would do +10. Probably not going to be in the game but, it's food for thought.
---
What realm was that? Name feels familiar.
---
As a warrior I was grinding mobs near the lake above SS. I saw a dwarf hunter grinding them out as well. A few minutes later horde starts ganking me, I'm trying to fight him and get near the hunter as well. But got ganked. The hunter whispers me "sorry man". I get to my corpse and horde comes back, I get a group invite mid fight, accept and see the hunter making booking it towards me. His pet goes to work, and we get the hk. We end up having a nice little session with the horde and his friends. The hunter "Tooheys" invites a couple friends to the group, level 60's arrive and we set out killing everything we see. I added Tooheys to my friends and we end up on runs together and get pretty close as friends. He ends up out leveling me, gets into hard core raiding. He leveled every possible class and max geared everyone one of them. For years he would run me or my wife through dungeons for hours. He played daily until he passed away last year. He would gear me, give me gold, enchants, whatever I needed, he just loved to play. Greatest online friend I've ever had. I'll be naming my guild in classic Tooheys.

A prot paladin on my private server used fiery blaze along with Masterwork Stormhammer and using dragon breath chilli. Not sure if he was just messing around but he seemed to be fairly successful in holding threat, and really enjoyed the frequent procs hitting everything
---
Oh dang that's a bummer, but at least you get to enjoy the best race/class in the game! 
---

Dude...if you're friend is playing Warrior, and you want to play Pally, then you would be the unstoppable Duo if you ran together...plus you would be able to run any dungeon you want as tank/healer and choose what dps is in your group for CC/gear/whatever.
---
This might be the least funny meme format of all time.
---
I hope youre right! I still feel all the oldschool players going "this is bad" is going to make the less oldschool players go "i heard this so i cant invite you" But i do hope there are gonna be some guilds that are gonna invite people even if theyre playing say shadowpriest, feral, enhancement or any of the underdogs. That would be awesome.
---
Oh I agree they are completely different games, I was just trying to put myself in the shoes of those working on retail.
---
It has its audience and I honestly hope it will go on having it since Classic longevity is tied to it, but if I was someone working on it I don't think I'd like seeing people shitting on my job all the time (whether right or wrong) nor seeing something of the past outshine my present. Just my opinion anyway.
---
That’s why I’m so excited to finally play on PvE.
---
"Posting your own fanart? Posting your own video? Posting your opinion? How dare you!"

---
I like your answer. That'd be one life-long drinking bender with music and laughs. I assume the dwarfs can handle it.
---
One I recommend is shaman. It's what I plan to go as. Enhancement is good, casting is good but for raids elemental likes to go oom asap. But for resto you get your rez at 12, and chain heal for them dummy thicc aoe heals. Every spec is viable for PvP, windfury 2h enhancement if you like playing off chance. Elemental will do thicc crits all day. And with the resto tree you can keep your group alive easily with amazing totem buffs fights will be wicked easy. and I'm sure you won't find it too difficult to raid in any spec. Elemental may have a harder time though due to them loving to use all their Mana as quickly as possible. But enhancement and resto will mostly certain to be in raids, heals are always wanted, and melee dps will love your totems. Shaman has a good bit of everything, and in my opinion the best hybrid class due to the fact they can do every play style effectively.

Relics of Wakening.

I tend to collect them over time, so I'm in no rush to get them all as soon as I can, I'm just asking about when each recipe will be introduced into the game in the phase system.

OP edited his post.
---
I believe I can at max get 25 hours a week :D

I mean, atleast you are doing something besides being a totem dropper.

That's what offtanks are for.

I think you should play rogue.

You can find things in the cities a lot easier.

It presumably will line up with the patches, so you'd have to go through some patch system
---
Collector's guides don't get many clicks I would bet lol, especially a holistic one like in vanilla.
---
As soon as you see what you gotta do you'll understand.  Your server will probably die long before you get the chance unfortunately.
---

---
That's on you and how you handle the game socially. If you play with friends, form your own groups, join a guild, etc. it's less of an issue. It can be painful for people who are just spamming LFG and trying to pug their way through everything though ( Especially since in more recent times tanks reserving items is more popular than it was in vanilla ).
---
I don’t know why you’re downvoted. This is a subreddit about classic WoW,  not classic+ or TBC. I loved TBC, don’t get me wrong. But I want to play vanilla. I don’t want to play something new. People need to save this shit for the right time. It isn’t now, before classic is even in beta.
---
I would make an alt banker account for all your mats, stockpile, then control the market later.
---
Not to mention enhancement CAN tank, but would never want to tank in a raid. You can do anything below a raid though, shamans can easily out threat a warrior, but the only reason they aren't more mainstream tanks is the fact mail wearers just don't have the mitigation. So if you want to try doing a tanking thing give it some tries in dungeons to see how you like it. Stoneclaw, earth shock, and rockbiter are your friend.
---
Unless they're a gnome. Then punt them.
---
Alliance quests and zones were created first and you can feel it whilst leveling, alliance questing feels more like an rpg and is a more comfy experience, compared to hordes leveling in 90% deserts and wastelands
---
I see, clearly my knowledge in movie is lacking. Thank you
---
There is certainly more nuance to it than that, but that sort of detail belongs in a written guide rather than an overview type video discussion.
---
I've recently tested ranks of flash of light for longevity with different levels of consumables with standard raid buffs and found the results pretty interesting, and not something i expected, despite being a seasoned priest as we tend to use different tools for different jobs where paladin literally only has 2 tools period.
---
One of the things I found was that you can extend Flash of Light (rank 4) chain casting, even with pre-raid bis to 8.5 minutes through use of runes and major mana potions,, but stepping up to rank 5 for a marginal increase in healing per second, drops your chain casting to just under 4 minutes, and stepping to rank 6 drops it again to just under 2 minutes. The difference in healing per rank (with gear) is about 10%. So if you are willing to only have 2 minutes of thoughput with max consumables (minus flask), you can get 20% more healing than if you went for rank 4. Or if you'd rather have slightly less healing, but stop to drink considerably less often, staying with the tank to provide cover, you can last for a very long time.
---
I was also surprised by how strong downranked flash can be with the right setup. Rank 4 flash is 90 mana and with \~400 healing (pre raid gear), talented amp magic, and blessing of light, it hits for 622 on average. This translates to about 415 hp/s and 6.91 heal per mana which is quite reasonable considering the gear, content level, and potential longevity (8.5 mins).
---
Always cracks me up seeing people whine about being corpse camped for hours.  Like, it never occurred to then to do something else, just keep trying over and over and hope the other person gets bored?  I got corpse camped back in vanilla.  I'd pick up the Batphone, get friends or guildies to come help out.  I'd take res sickness, hearth, and quest elsewhere.  I'd play an alt for a while.  But these idiots just come on the Internet and moan about how the same guy kept killing them for six hours straight...
---
While I agree with what you're saying, I am a player who cares about viability in the end game, even if I'm playing casually. Furthermore, I don't enjoy healing and therefore shaman won't be a thing for me
---
Cherry picking, ad hominem, tu quoque, strawman, etc. You have so many logical fallacies that I don't believe this will be productive to continue. Furthermore, you have admitted to saying you will avoid any argument you might agree with. This means you will only argue with me until one of us stops responding. Truly, I wish you well.
---
Well you need to cover your basis when it comes to raids. Cause of Buffs are a huge part of raiding. Although im sure there will be the cookie cutter weenies who want real vanilla days and just take whats expected... Stay away from them lol. Go with the guys who will take an extra War DPS or Feral DPS or a Ret Pally. You'll have alot more fun. Cause picking a class is an investment. If you hate your class but just play it to "fit in" you will kill your Vanilla Craving. Back then i picked a Hunter... LOVED levelling now i am going to play a Druid. I mainly PVP so ill run flags and just F \*\*\*  S\*\*\* Up and running lol Worst case i can Heal in raids if im really needed but other than that ill be running Feral/Bal for PVP.
---
What is the best "buddy" class/spec? I would love to play a character that people are always excited to have in their group. Any ideas?
---
Goddam Loch Ness monster I aint givin' you no treefiddy!
---
By being an enhancement shaman you are nothing more than a cheerleader in the first place. By using Nightfall, you at least bring *some* utility to the raid and give your raid leader an excuse to invite you to the raid.
---
What is a blue post?
---
Yeah, I can see that, and judging my my inbox most people did just that lol
---
I tanked Onyxia on a ******** server that was tuned to 5 man.

I agree, if i had gone horde, i would have probably went with shaman.

Oh gotchya. The video I watched briefly went over it and I was curious if the mechanic would even be worth it.
---
I just did that one on a private server. Sooo sick.

Shhh gaining 2000 subscribers and in the top 10 most active users of any subreddit is dying and you're being disrespectful.
---
Cause we're angry all the time, we're never organized enough to win a damn AV and are tanks look more boss in armor! 😂
---
If classic ends up being really popular and they end up doing classic+ servers, I can almost guarantee it's gonna happen. At least cosmetic things like pets and/or mounts.

I don’t really plan to pvp much until 51ish so do you think I should just wear owl gear? (Spirit)

I plan to quit my shit job and play for a month before I find another shit job.

So I should be able to hit 60 in the first couple of weeks hopefully.

Warriors that will tank lol. Everyone needs them no one wants to play them.

Alas, the market can also flounder about.

That post was actually already the response to a similiar Horde one. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/please_help_me_get_excited_about_playing_horde/
---
Yeah no doubt, might be the price we have to pay (in addition to sub of course!).  At least judging by retail they're smart enough to avoid P2W
---
Well if pally is a more popular class than shaman, then horde might have more need for priests to fill their healer slots. Idk which will be more popular, though.
---
Yes, which is what I'm asking for help with as I don't know exactly when a lot of recipes were added.
---
I've farmed plenty of rare recipes on private servers, and those are spotty at best when it comes to longevity, and there were definitely people on them who had, for example, every tailoring/enchanting pattern and formula, even the raid ones.  This is by no means an impossible feat and I came pretty close to it myself without dedicating as much time/effort as people do to other things in game.
---
The philosophy or whatever you want to call it of Warcraft evolved as players involved and continue playing. And new video Gamers were born, and they were born into a world where video games handed players more rewards more often in order to keep their attention.
---
But for sure, in order to praise classic you absolutely have to s*** on Battle for Azeroth. Totally logical.
---
If Fear ward was really that important then Horde wouldn't be able to clear Raids. Don't let anyone tell you that Fear Ward is the end all be all of raiding. Dwarves may be prioritized over Humans but that doesn't mean you can't get into a raid as either Human or NE Priest.
---
Came here to say Disarmonia Mundi, saw reference to Vurtne in OP post. Today I am not disappointed.
---
Because these OSRS people just know that this is a thing, nothing more. In their minds nothing else matters. In their magical world they simply put it on top of Vanilla and it turns into Vaniila+. 
---
When asked how OSRS works, if they know how Vanilla works and how would potential OSRS be implemented, all you get is a downvote.

What you were looking for was literally the point of the other post. Unless you are looking to personally be convinced and are following the time-honored internet tradition that anecdotes handed to you personally are inherently more valuable then anecdotes you find through the search bar.
---
Never seen the show but that guy is my spirit animal right now.
---
Oh yes thank you for the link.
---
If you're trying to learn macros on a pserver you have to keep in mind that Classic will be very different because they will use a system much more close to retail than original vanilla.
---
My suggestion would be to use a starter account on retail, it's free up to level 20. Practice there and also keep in mind than not everything you do may work on Classic, we need at least a beta to know exactly what will be allowed and what won't be.
---
I used a pretty standard SL trispec for it. Something like 7/31/13. Enough to get imp Life Tap, SL, MD, and Bane.
---
The whole thing started as a joke when one of my guildmates noticed how much HP I had with my stam set on and pointed it out in vent. "We should just have ______ tank lol". 
---
We had already put MC and BWL thoroughly on farm at that point, so everyone agreed to do it just for fun. Back then guilds generally didn't pug out their MC runs so everyone had to show up anyway to clear it for more TF's. When classic comes out this opportunity for non-ideal tanking probably won't exist.
---
Ony and a lot of the bosses in MC are immune to fire, so most of the work was done with good old-fashioned shadowbolt spam. I did have a paladin in the group with me for conc aura, but as I recall the DPS still had to watch their threat.
---
What's the best endgame PVE mage spec? Thinking about rolling mage. 
---
Also how good are they for leveling?
---
Do not know what to do yet. Warrior or mage. I'll problaby go for the mage just so I have some gold to level a warrior latar and make it easier. I haven't played that much Vanilla though. Might try some healing too
---
I just hope they at least leave out level boosts and faction changes. I'd at least accept things like race changes and a barbershop in classic+ if it becomes a reality, but the two things I mentioned will just kill classic+ servers for a good 75% of the classic crowd at least.

Nah, our first 20lvls of being efficient as npc mobs will be our pushback.

Yep XD
---
Have you ever been able to play any other game while you were playing old school RuneScape at the same time? And find Value in your time investments in both things?
---
Answer is, you can do it if you want to do it but nobody can tell you how you will feel
---
You can try to sugarcoat this as much but enh shamans are shit for PvE. They are worse than any other serious contender at every potential application possible. 
---
You can a "meme spec" like feral work if you minmax, but not enh shaman. Sorry.
---
It’s funny, my first “mmo” experience was OSRS. Then one Christmas I got a nice computer and vanilla and was I not ready. I absolutely fell in love with the game. Everything was so fun and actually having abilities rather than auto attack and casting spells was so pretty and nice. Needless to say you’ll definitely enjoy it.
---
As a warlock you would have to push more buttons which means you have to be present more often and zoned out less often.
---
Fear ward is in no way worth it. Play horde.
---
Go back to filming another bad movie Liam.
---
I don't think it's that dramatic. MC/Onyxia: Crown of Destruction (who actually needs that over you? hunts get T2, warr have Lionheart), Spinal Reaper (Boner is far better and you probably won't have many 2H warrs regardless), Chromatic Gauntlet (pretty cheap and there's no rush in replacing devilsaur's set it can come way later), 
---
Where the competition appears... Ony's head (everybody's going to get their own eventually), Accuria(would make sense to get it last), True Flight (if you want to ignore the fact that there are other alternatives for the other classes), quick strike 
---
BWL is basically more of the same.
---
At the end of the day I don't believe it matters if enhancement shaman gets a Quick Strike over a rogue. It's going to affect 0,009% of the raid's total damage. It doesn't change much to get a 10 ap upgrade for any dps character, so how could it affect the raid? It's inconsequential at best. 
---
I'd personally be more attentive to the character of the player beyond that class. If a player is truly dedicated in making an enhancement shaman work, that guy is not going to show up to raid without at least 20 mana pots in his bags, someone with the dedication is going to take raiding more seriously than others. 
---
I don't understand why you'd say it has nothing to do with healers. I've seen the POV of a resto shaman in a raid made of 6 others like him and he'd do absolutely nothing because there was simply too much healing going on. 
---
And it's not like you can deny the utility a shaman brings, a WF totem gives you 1 extra attack out of 5 to everyone in the group and that's just one totem out of many. 
---
That said, yes I'd only bring a dedicated guy who understands his role perfectly. An axe wielding Orc would already be a good sign he means business.
---
He was server first to 60. It is not "just" a speed run.
---
The basic rule of healing 40 mans is mana efficiency priority unless I feel pressured to start upranking. And then you're making some very basic decisions still trying to be as mana efficient as possible. And in a good raid that means just spamming my heal/flash of light/downranked healing touch respectively
---
The problem with good raids is everything is controlled and everything goes as expected. So you already have an idea what heal and what rank you should be using for your composition. 
---
The level of excitement one can derive from healing and the skill of your raid are inversely correlated. Your excitement is rally going to be high as a healer if the skill of your tanks/fellow healers is high. Or you just have a lot of healers they don't have to be good. 
---
Which is why your guest said he always spammed flash of light. There are times he should cast holy light....If his raid isn't doing it's job. It's just it doesn't happen very often in content like this
---
Priests should just sitting there spamming heal, they spam flash heal cuz they want to cheese the meters not because it's rational most of the time.
---
Hogger.... because... kill count
---
You use all of those fallacies yourself. All of them.
---
I can't give you an answer, but i have a question. Have you played runescape before, and how does OSRS additions affect the game? 
---
Did it keep its vanilla feeling or it turned into something else. How does the community take the changes, are there disagreements and drama?
---
Anyway, If you like old school MMORPG, heavy on RPG aspects and player interaction, then yes you will have fun.
---
I'm sorry, I was out of line.
---
Hunters are better. Your pet is more survivable, hits harder, and holds threat better than lock pets. Lock pets have more utility, but that's not really helping you on your grind.
---
 lOk'TaR oGaR 😂
---
I want to mainly play pvp, mostly bgs but also world. I'm on the fence between hunter or rogue. Any reccomendations?
---
They are very different games, OSRS is more of a dopamine simulator with xp/gold grinds. Vanilla is more of a "realistic world" you place yourself in.
---
I think you could very easily do something like barb fishing + classic.  Hell if your levelling a paladin you could do just about anything with how afk the class is.
---
That being said, I think I will leave my clients turned off while I play wow, I don't want it to hinder my experience, at least at launch.
---
Not this time around
---
The aggro range on those murlocs were fucking insane.
---
I dunno when but blizz nerfed the aggro range of all mobs somewhere during WoW's history. When I came back right before bfa i noticed that I were able to easily serpentine between mobs. Back in vanilla I usually had to kill my way through a path of enemies.

I never would've guessed that seeing such small crits would be so satisfying. Critical hits lost their impact sometime around the 60k POM pyros. Glad to see 2.5k Mortal Strikes will be devastating again :)

There is a debuff priority mechanism made of 3 tiers. A SS can't overwrite other important buffs. Might overwrite a Deep Wounds that will be reapplied 2 seconds later.
---
&gt; Early 20s I’ll probably head over to Westfall real quick for the blue staff but then it’s back to Nelf quests. I think you only have to Defias quests, not the People’s Militia questline to get it but I cannot remember for the life of me.
---
I have been googling around for the same question. As far as I've gathered, you need to complete Peoples Militia before you can get the Defias Brotherhood questline.
---
This. If you have a 3.5 second swing timer, and the mob has a 2s swing time, you pop in and hit it and have 2 seconds to escape its hit box. The aim here is to mitigate as much damage on warrior as possible. I don’t remember mobs hit boxes being so large, or swing timers being batched and recognizing the initial hitbox during the downtime...I don’t think that this would be an issue, if it is then its very sad because hamstring kiting alone makes leveling a warrior much more thrilling.
---
You make an argument out of not competing with other shamans for loot, which is fair, but then shoot yourself in the foot by mentioning that enhances would roll on DFT, and that it's *somehow* a good thing? Not only is it complete nonsense, it also kills the semblance of a point you were trying to make. The only guilds that are going to give DFT to a shaman are the ones that are memeing around. Nobody is going seriously let a shaman roll on that, but then again, you seem to have issues understanding how loot works in raids.
---
&gt; I was an off tank in BWL and of course I had to pass loot for the main tank because of nazi guild leader. 
---
The video you linked is not even a good representation of what enhance DPS will be. The guy is using balls to the walls consumeables, using mana pot+runes on cooldown and having spell power flask up, as well as having gear that enhance shamans will realistically never obtain. It's not a "fresh study" it's a joke of a video like most of the other guy's videos.
---
When classic was announced I'd planned on taking 3 weeks vacation and going HAM.
---
Then in December I got a new job as a contract worker. Way more money, but, no paid time off. So I'll be a filthy casual when it releases. :(

I thought the message of that was "rogues can beat anything, in any scenario, with any equipment, as long as they have all their cooldowns".
---
Same. I can't wait for it to be legit.
---
Collecting salty tears every 10 minutes is a true Rogue' s favorite hobby.
---
Using /played time as a tracker is not a great way of doing it, if you are trying to be accurate with competitive speed run times, primarily because you can log off.
---
I know Joanna did not abuse rested experience, and logging off, but he did set a precedent that makes it hard to compare two runs. I know there will people using his runs as a benchmark, and some aggressive players looking to improve on his time. If we make the timer /played it’s going to be too easy to beat with rest manipulation.
---
If the community wants to have a competitive speedrunning scene for 1-10,1-20,1-30 etc. they should use a timer other than /played. Even if that means sleeping in the middle of a run. In some communities they require breaks for health purposes that doesn’t count against your times, this makes sense for Wow.
---
Yea getting it done on your two main professions ok
---
Having all of them done?
---
And you need 3 types of leatherworking and 2 types of blacksmithing? 
---
Enchanting and tailoring are relatively high chance drops next to the blacksmithing IME
---
Try 30% of mobs, and the ranged ones usually don’t have much armor, so you shallack them anyway.
---
Think it would be sweet to be part of the Darkmoon Fair, and relatively safe too
---
I’d have picked someone in Teldrassil because that place would be Avatar level of beautiful in real life, but we all know that doesn’t end well, so based on this knowledge of the future, I’d say Darkmoon Fair is great (assuming they still have their own awesome island that they live on that players simply don’t have access to in Classic 😋)
---
Have been thinking for some time on a main. Would like to hear your thoughts.   
---
*Background*    
---
I've extensively healed in other MMOs, so looking to try something new. DPS is pretty satisfying, always competing against the meter. Tanking would be brand new for me, but also looks interesting. Don't particularly care about min-max.  
---
*Goals*  
---
-I'm semi-casual. Looking to dabble in both PvP/PvE, so hopefully the class is engaging in both.
---
*Details*  
---
-I find one-button PvE rotations to be mind-numbingly boring. So I think that eliminates mage&amp;warlock?  
---
-Excluding healers, this leaves rogue/war/hunter
---
-From those, I've played hunter/rogue at 60. Both were fun. I found rogue levelling easy enough. "We already have a rogue" is a bit frustrating at 60, and I'm a bit worried about hunter scaling. Both had relatively engaging rotations and good farm ability. Rogue PvP was fun.      
---
-Then there's warrior for easy dungeon runs at 60 as a tank, and probably dps in raids? Sounds pretty good. The only worrying thing is their lack of farming. How bad is it, really?
---
-Druid may also work, but I worry I'll be pigeonholed into healing. I played one a bit til 20, and really liked the lore so far.  
---
Any ideas/thoughts? Is warrior the way to go for me, or some else?
---
I was in the same boat.. First I stopped on warlock but as I'm going to play with a mate I'm planning to roll a priest, because who doesn't want some heals when pexing/wpvp-ing ? 
---
For pexing warlock is very confortable but as a priest, once you get a good wand it's more than ok. 
---
Mind control will be very fun in some places. 
---
Imo Shadow is very good in wpvp as it's a top tier 1v1 spec, even if mana is a serious concern. And if you want to heal go with a warrior mate and destroy everybody.
---
Im pretty sure they wont

Your attacks cant be dodged, parried or blocked from behind. Has nothing to do with crits—rogues can backstab which gets bonus damage (and potentially crit chance from talents? Not sure, I don’t rogue.)
---
Swing batta batta!

Did you also have Assassin’s Blade for those ambushes? I think I have since deleted my Twink rogue (aptly named Twinkrogue) but I didn’t manage to get shadowfang or assassin’s blade before heirlooms came in

If you don't already know why the Horde are awesome, stay Alliance. Scum.

Shaman will be by far least popular of the three
---
Priest overall more popular, but on alliance there will be more paladins
---
Is it not sometime this summer?
---
I have all the time in the world until somewhere this summer hah
---
Yeah math is fine (to our limited knowledge), but it was never done in vanilla and I doubt Blizz would allow it. Its exploiting the system. It would be very easy to just add an extra step for example if all honor is tied to give it to the first one to get there or something like that.

I remember, \*creak\* when you could actually PVP \*creak\* in Booty Bay, \*creak\* and you could just stand there (hopefully unnoticed on a rooftop) and just laugh at \*creak\* all the players jumping into the water, and/or ducking inside buildings \*creak\* -- not realizing that you could shoot inside there as well, \*creak\* and it finally dawned on folks how to use walls and stairs \*creak\* as LOS to stop being two-shot.

In the north of the Eastern Kingdoms stood the grand state of Lordaeron. Its lands were watched over by a long and unbroken line of powerful sages called the Guardians of Tirisfal, a land that by legend was the death site of the titanic watcher Tyr, who had sacrificed himself in a battle against one of the Old God's servants Zakazj, but I digress because that's hardly important now.
---
What's really important, and what sets in motion the grand intrigue of Azeroth's modern history, is the curious circumstances surrounding the penultimate Guardian of Tirisfal, Aegwynn, and her unfortunate son. Aegwynn had done battle with the Avatar of Sargeras—the fallen titan and commander of the Burning Legion—to protect the world from demonic invasion as her predecessors had done. But Sargeras had played a trick on Aegwynn and possessed her yet-unborn child Medivh, laying dormant in him for decades.
---
On the faraway planet Draenor, teetering on the brink of physical collapse, the Burning Legion's Orc puppet Gul'dan had played a similar trick. He convinced the warchiefs of the Orcish clans to drink the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth and thus tap into a mighty, primal power. But the blood (obviously) corrupted the Orcs and made them thralls to Mannoroth's will. And then when the time came to strike Azeroth, Gul'dan led his Old Horde to the Dark Portal, which would bridge the two worlds together with a foul and ancient magic. Sargeras took full control of Medivh and led him to the southernmost reaches of the Eastern Kingdoms, into a swamp known as the Black Morass, and from there the two tore space asunder, spilling out their fel-infused slaves upon the world.
---
The humans of the southern kingdom Stormwind mobilized to combat this threat in what would be referred to in future days as the Second War. They were victorious in the end, but it was a pyrrhic victory, embroiling them in deep racial tensions and scattering the Orcs across the land.
---
It is then that three distinct destinies of three pitiable villains would shape the world, and the three noble friends of these villains would try to save them. Only one would succeed.
---
Back in the north, the heir apparent of Lordaeron, the mighty and noble Prince Arthas, was gearing up for a grand crusade. A deep and evil threat had begun to stir in Northrend, let loose upon Azeroth by the same actions that brought the Orcs. The fallen Shaman Ner'zhul, once the teacher of Gul'dan and his predecessor in capitulating to the Burning Legion, had forged a pact with Kil'jaeden the Deceiver, Left Hand of Sargeras. When he acted of his own volition, his soul was torn asunder and placed by the dreadlord servants of Kil'jaedan in an accursed helmet. He was to be the Lich King, an agent of chaos that would assault Azeroth from the north while encased in a tomb of ice.
---
Arthas sought this (to him yet nameless) threat, as a mysterious plague had begun to turn the citizens of Lordaeron into undead fiends, and the Last Guardian of Tirisfal had abandoned the world. He marched northward toward the land of the High Elves, following planted clues that the plague was spreading from the city of Stratholme. Once there, the dreadlord Mal'ganis tricked Arthas into committing a culling to "save the people" and lead an assault on Northrend. This, of course, would be Arthas's downfall. Once he reached Northrend with his expedition, the Lich King began to influence him and lead him to the cursed blade Frostmourne, which when grasped would bind him forevermore with Ner'zhul. Now a death knight of the Scourge, Arthas returned home to assassinate his father, lead an army of undead into the High Elf capital and pollute their magic fount—the Sunwell—to resurrect the dread lich Kel'thuzad (lots of apostrophes in this tale). His dear friend Jaina Proudmoore, confidant of the forces of Stormwind and isolated heiress of the seafaring state of Kul Tiras, tried her best to save him. She failed in this task, yet gained an unlikely yet pivotal ally.
---
In the human concentration camp Durnholde Keep, the future savior of the Orcs was held captive as a pet gladiator by the warden Aedelas Blackmoore. His name was Thrall, as was his title and his profession, for he was nothing more than a slave. But he was a slave with a mighty and forgotten heritage: the son of the fallen Durotan, chieftain of the Frostwolf Orcs. The Frostwolves had escaped enslavement to Mannoroth and the Burning Legion by refusing to drink his blood, and in the years following the Second War they found refuge hiding in the Alterac Mountains. When Thrall finally escaped, he had the fortune of meeting Jaina and thus creating the first real thread of kinship the two species had known. Thrall went west, to the land of Kalimdor. He landed on a desolate stretch of land that he would call Durotar after his late father and claimed it as the conquest stronghold of the New Horde he would soon create. Finding alliance with the local tribe of Trolls known as the Darkspear—cast away from their brethren for refusing the ancient Trollish rites of ritual sacrifice due to the spirit visions of their leader Vol'jin—and then the noble Tauren who roamed the fields of Mulgore and the Barrens, Thrall marched north to confront the Old Horde. There he would find his father's once-confidant Grommash Hellscream, patient zero in the blood curse of Mannoroth. The Old Horde had begun to assault Ashenvale, a wooded stronghold of the ancient Night Elves, in preparation for an invasion of the World Tree Nordrassil, which grew high on the peak of Mount Hyjal. It is there that the curse was broken forever, when Grommash had a brief moment of clarity brought by the appearance of his uncorrupted spiritual nephew. He saw a future where Orcs could live without the tyranny of the Burning Legion, and he took his mighty axe Gorehowl and destroyed Mannoroth, in a scarred field that would soon be named Demon Fall Canyon. His victory was also his death: a true embodiment of the Orcish principle Lok'tar Ogar. But as Hellscream fell, the Orcs rose, free at last of their chains. They followed their new leader Thrall, who struck a momentary alliance with the Night Elves and the humans in a grave battle to come.
---
Soon the Right Hand of Sargeras, Archimonde, would launch his own attack. He first struck at Dalaran in the east, to prevent the Kirin Tor from assisting in the fight. Then he marched on Nordrassil to consume its essence. He would have succeeded but for this shaky armistice between Orc and Human. The New Horde's ranks came to the Night Elves' aid and held Archimonde back long enough for Malfurion Stormrage, ruler of the Night Elves, to call upon an army of his ancestor wisps and slay the Eredar Lord. Hyjal was scarred and its world tree wounded, but the demon had been banished in the end.
---
North lay the Night Elf city of Darnassus, where the brother of its leader waited in an underground cage for 10,000 years. Illidan, finally broke free from his jailer Maiev Shadowsong and traveled into the Maelstrom to the inaccurately-labeled "Tomb" of Sargeras. He found the skull of Gul'dan and used its latent magic to transform himself into the first of the Demon Hunters. While his brethren thought him mad for power, he knew what they could not have foreseen. The long-ago wounds of the first Burning Legion assault millennia ago had left him weary and wary, and he enacted his own convoluted plan to destroy the Legion once and for all, but to succeed, he would need to fall. None could know his plot or it would fail. To that end he abandoned the Night Elves and sought unlikely alliances with two pivotal foes: the tortured leader of the now-decimated Blood Elves, and the handmaiden of the Naga Queen.
---
He did not wish to wait until another Legion invasion, for next time Azeroth would not be so lucky without preparation, and as we all know, nobody is prepared enough for Illidan. With Prince Kael'thas and Lady Vashj at his side, he set in motion two major actions. One would establish a foothold in the shattered Orc homeworld now called Outland. The other? Destroy the Lich King.
---
Illidan was not powerful enough for the combined might of Arthas and Ner'zhul, and he fell in battle. Though he was not slain and thus escaped before being turned, his loss would haunt him as he retreated through the Dark Portal. But one important ramification of his fight with Arthas would have resounding effects on the lands south.
---
Sylvanas Windrunner was one of three noble High Elf daughters, and the Ranger General of Quel'thelas. She, too, fell in battle against Arthas when he marched to the Sunwell, and in a petty act of revenge, he turned her into a banshee, to be enslaved to him yet, unlike the other Scourge, remain aware of her bonds. But Arthas was not yet as powerful as he thought, and when Illidan fought him, he lost control for just the slightest, briefest moment. He lost control of Sylvanas. And she immediately severed her mental chains and assisted the other undead who also had been freed by virtue of their southern geography. She would call these undead refugees the Forsaken and create her own kingdom in the sewers of Arthas's abandoned birthright city.
---
Four years have passed since these worldshaking events. The Orcish Horde has grown in number and built a makeshift yet mighty city in Durotar. The humans of Stormwind have renewed old allegiances with the isolationist Dwarfs and Gnomes who live in the Khaz Mountains to the north. The Night Elves have maintained their allegiance of convenience with the humans, forged as it were in the fight against Archimonde, and for four years the armistice between the New Horde and the Alliance has limped onward. But all good things must come to an end. As the Forsaken reach out to the Horde, turning their backs on the southern humans who had done the same, the drums of war echo once again.
---
This is the World of Warcraft.
---
Finally done, and in under an hour! Not bad.
---
In raids Paladin healing is mindless flash of light spam, but Paladins also have so many tools. You’ll be cleansing frequently, and timely Blessing of Protection and other spells can literally save the raid. A great pally knows how to use all their support spells. This is especially critical in PvP where your support spells are Godly AF. 
---
This is similarly true for Shamans but I have little to no max level experience playing them.

I played on horde for years before changing factions because of a new group of friends I've made at that time. They always asked me why I ever played on the "chaotic, unlawful, ugly faction" for so long. 
---
To be fair, the thing that always fascinated me about the horde was the great diversity of it. The violent orcs besides the peaceful taurens, the exotic trolls and gothic undeads. They are all so different from each other and at the same time there was something so similar to them that brought them together:
---
They usually represent some ugly of the human personality that people usually want to overlook. Don't get me wrong, I find the alliance great too, but most of them are all... in the same spectrum of the good guys? The warriors of light, the just and fair. 
---
While that's all very interesting to follow too, I used to love the fact that the horde represented the dark side of reality more accurately. We have the bad, the ugly, the reject and the untrusted all in one place - and the magic of it, for me? Even in that gutter, we managed to have great honorable personas that were followed to hell and back; and they were followed not because they were *nice*, but still were *good*. Even in the worst place, where you would expect the less to find someone that inspiring, there was something the Horde could teach you about being an unity, a faction of seemly not miscible individuals that learned how to work together. 
---
Don't let me fool you, they **are** full of wrong. Some leaders and npcs are straight *awful*. But I would rather follow a warchief that went through the worst, grew besides the most difficult type of people, and still followed to path to not surrender and be the righteous, using their powers to bring more unity. Not because of any sugarcoated moral, but because they learned about all the shades of the world and decided that being great it's the most important thing.
---
Yeah honestly even with the pet, the warlock probably has to do more than say a hunter or even a mage while grinding.
---
I'm not yet satiated on this meme...
---
Warlocks are mushrooms.
---
Warlocks, priests, druids, and hunters are the zero-downtime classes. All 4 of them can grind without having to take breaks at all; at most, druid will need to shift to heal themselves, hunters will need to mend pet/bandage, and locks will need to life tap but that's it.
---
That said IMO hunter is still the most robust because of how strong hunter pets are compared to warlocks; and they can grind efficiently without using a single ability where warlocks at least need to be conscious of their HP/mana.
---
Thrall will hunt you for the rest of your Alliance life.  :)
---
Horde by a mile. We only have one source to dispel magic. A shaman is a piss poor replacement for a paladin.
---
Thank you for the answer
---
I'm still hungry for more of this format. MY THIRST IS NOT QUENCHED
---
warlock and shadow priest are both very strong in duels
---
Hi, /u/frozenjb
---
This game will already consume my life. No reason to go full neck beard by role playing.
---
Yeah, if your goal is to get experience stance dancing, sure. I don’t leave battle stance until like...level 30, unless I’m tanking a dungeon. 
---
Personally I prefer piercing howl in early leveling, and pretty much until 40, when I can get mortal strike and sweeping strikes. 
---
Even after I get mortal strike I poke down into fury to get piercing howl. 
---
And yeah, like you said its not too too spammable, not like heroic strike at least. But the thing is...you’re spending 25 rage vs. 13-15 to get two attacks that have a very similar damage to heroic strike early on. With a slow two hander, this is huge, you pretty much get the rage for a cleave from one swing+taking two attacks when you dip in. Its about every other attack to cleave + piercing howl with a slow enough weapon. 
---
It’s just an absolutely incredible talent. It gives you so much survivability all game long.
---
This sounds intense brah

Gonna take a lotta hot pockets and mtn dew

I love mtn dew

A warrior pvp loot? What about a shaman pvp loot? Why is one player more important than another if it doesn't negatively affect the raid?
---
It fits the standards. My point was that an enhancement shaman is not a charity case, he can earn his keep like everyone else.
---
If you wanna talk about standards what about the giant abyss that exists between classes when it comes to consumes? Have you tried to farm as a healer? Why is it that mages can farm 20 mobs at a time and a priest struggle to kill one? This game is not fair. But that doesn't mean that anyone gets to join the raid in pyjamas. An enh shaman would have to bring a lot of consumables to be relavant, especially runes and mana pots but if he does, he should be respected for it.
---
"Don't guilds try and take like 4-6 shamans for their totems?"
---
Guilds would but, is that why you leveled a shaman? The shaman is not a very popular class because it's nothing but a mediocre class that can drop WF totem until, until AQ40 drops.
---
we used raid icons for that, (moon, star, tit, triangle etc)  But maybe those were not available from the start
---
This. Very often you will see people of the opposite faction, you’ll both take note of each other and carefully go about your quest with one eye on them as a precaution, and then neither attacks. Most of the time I got ganked was by people who were specifically LOOKING for a fight, and those are pretty obvious, because they are not questing or grinding, they are either searching for someone to gank or already in the middle of ganking someone when you run into them.
---
another mage.
---
What does that mean?
---
&gt;that

---
You're playing an off meta spec....So you would go to the bottom of hte loot council
---
You don't pull your weight why would you be rewarded more than the fury warriors?
---
Always the correct answer, 100%, because we are all not robots who whenever we get into a PVP battle we always execute our pre-programmed fight routine against that specific class with the exact same efficiency and calculation every time.
---
Key binds: Mouse wheel scroll Up, Down, middle press, Q,E,R,F,C,V,T,G, 1-5 (also every key bind mentioned while holding Shift and CtRL)

I mainly reserve CTRL key binds for focus targeting, and use Alt, which I did not mention, for self cast

I’m a long time RS player, and have been playing OSRS since the beginning. I never really got into wow, because I didn’t have consistent Computer access or the money to pay for monthly membership. I’m going to be throwing myself into Classic now that I’m able to. 
---
The Fresh start of OSRS was incredible. Although lots of people didn’t like that aspect, I would have rather started over than continue with RS3. And getting to play a good game, with an already established community, from the start, is going to be a great way to go about starting Wow

lock or hunter both will work

No problem. Enjoy!
---
Exactly, the Tauren racial is completely worthless for PvE. The racial only becomes useful when at extremely low HP which you shouldn't be at anyway. If you are, then you have a healing problem in your raid. Also, most if not all bosses are immune to stun, so Warstomp is also useless (except for dungeons obviously). Troll racials are better all around for Raiding, and in fact, I would argue that Trolls are the #1 horde race for Raiding Prot warriors.
---
Two different types of games osrs is more passive you can consume tv while playing it classic wow is more active but you can still watch tv and quest. Both have strong player led economies so if playing the trading game is your jam you will love making gold in wow. The professions can be rewarding or a gold sink you just have to do the research. Group play is where wow shines there’s no better feeling than finishing your first dungeon, downing your first raid bosses, even getting that close win in BG. Socially wow is the better game IMO. Addictive ness wow is equally addicting and time consuming as osrs I wouldn’t expect to play both hardcore at the same time.
---
shadow priests are god tier with the right gear.
---
Can u DM me technique ? I can't decide on Hunter, mage or Warlock for farming character, because I'm trying to keep my character list as short as possible. I was leaning toward Warlock until I realized Hunter and mage have way higher potential
---
Friday morning 9am.  Be there, or hear about it from someone else.

Wool cloth is always a big seller anyway. Smallest level range to get it and not many humanoid mobs to drop it.
---
Light leather on the other hand hardly ever sells more than 1-2 copper above vendor price taking into account the AH fee.
---
1 person made a joke and said to get beast slaying enchant... a comment that could have easily been ignored but he overreacted anyways. Another giving advice telling him its not really ideal; I'd hardly call either toxic. You don't need to reply to every comment and people are allowed to make jokes.
---
Depends on the phase.
---
But it’s generally arcane frost or deep frost followed by arcane fire.
---
They’re good levelers and sit in the tier behind warlocks and hunters.
---
Would be interesting to see how race distribution varies by realm.
---
Your guild will need lots of people. They will need you to be the class you want to show up with every night :)
---
Innkeeper in Goldshire on Moonguard :D  I'll never lack for entertainment.
---
Or the fact that we all had a clown-suit of mismatched gear?
---
Hunter should beat mages, rouges, and maybe a warrior
---
That is a realistic timeframe.
---
Heh, Gotem!!
---
All the smoke gave them cancer.
---
I don't know the direct answer to your question, but I want to point out that everyone will be in your shoes for quite a while. That is, everyone will be in patchwork gear. If you want to go with a 30/0/21 elemental PvP spec, you'll mostly be in cloth for a while but you'll still be able to have fun.
---
Sorry, you're asking about 3 different classes that are effectively the rock-paper-scissors in this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5\_U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5_U) 
---
Enjoy.
---
holy crap! brb gonna fill the tub and get some wine to get started on this haha
---
It all comes down to preference. If you really don't want to play Alliance, this subreddit is clearly not the place to go to change your mind.
---
That said, Alliance is where the story's at. Period. There's continuity in the storyline all the way from uncovering the mysteries of the Deadmines to unmasking and defeating Onyxia. You will slowly grow from a nobody to a hero who is instrumental in saving the collective soul of the humans of Stormwind. You get front row seats to the political drama between the Ironforge and Dark Iron dwarves. You will help the night elves, wise yet suspicious of everyone around them, scour corruption from their sacred lands. You will aid the industrious gnomes in reclaiming their marvelous home city.
---
All of the Alliance races are in the midst of terrible hardship. The humans used to be the supreme power of the Eastern Kingdoms. Now Stormwind stands alone, and the king is mysteriously missing as politics rot the hallowed city from the inside. The gnomes have been cast out from Gnomeregan by a lecherous traitor and are now refugees. The night elves have lost their vaunted immortality as the forests surrounding their ancient homes wither under demonic corruption. The daughter of King Muradin Bronzebeard has been kidnapped by their evil gray dwarf cousins.
---
The question is, do you have the strength and the courage to answer the call of the Alliance and right these wrongs?
---
I hear ya, have loads of vacation time and wanting and hoping for a release date before I hit "submit".
---
&gt;Are you somewhat mad?
---
Seems like you are.
---
Ignore tips.
---
I had both. So much fun one shotting people in bgs!
---
The only extensive PVP experience I have is with warrior and believe me you can play how long you want, frost mages will run circles around you.
---
Anyway I want to play something else for Classic, but still not sure.
---
It’ll suck. 
---
30/0/21 is a far better spec.
---
On the topic of hunter scaling, from what i understand they really start to fall off in AQ, which is decently far down the content line. They also dont really fall off in pvp either. Warriors are also pretty bad farmers, but if you tank you can always charge people to tank runs or something. Its not great though. I would keep in mind that each class in vanilla is going to have some area of the game they dont particularly excel in. Warriors are great in most aspects of the game, but dont solo pvp or farm very well. Each class has to compromise something.
---
Retail is a terrible experience for new players. The leveling to 120 is rather broken and once you hit 120 you are faced with a huge learning curve that should be addressed before getting to 120 imo.... In classic you wont have that problem although it will be much harder to hit level 60 in classic then it will be to hit 120 in retail.
---
Yeah, looked at that thread after reading your comment, and he definitely overreacted. However, I understand that he could be frustrated only having one good sub to post this type of question on and his post is being diluted with BS. 
---
&gt; You'll be ready for The Beast in UBRS
---
Was funny tho.
---
By default a and d strafe while the right mouse is held down
---
Seems legit, they never saw one they might think it's a protected specie and don't dare to attack it !
---
However I forgot to mention it, but I'll play horde.
---
I understand now thank you for enlightening me
---
You have valid points but they are more because of my bad redaction skills. DFT was a bad example, I take it back. And no believe me I know very well how a guild works. I sacrificed a lot for it, anybody who played classic at the time should have a strong sense of sacrifice but an off tank in bad conditions certainly did more than others.
---
Pots and runes are absolutely necessary for an enh shaman to raid, nobody should deny that as it's part of the job. There is no reason for one to not receive the same opportunities to gear as others. There is absolutely nothing special about playing a dps warrior, it's the dumbest and easiest thing in wow. Raiding as one makes everything imaginable a lot easier. I don't see why they should get some sense of privilege for it. When a gear upgrade is the same for everyone, it barely affects the raid as a whole. Raiding is not hard, you just have to learn the dance, gear is certainly a big factor but understanding the encounter is what matter the most.
---
I'm not asking for charity, I'm offering an alternative that is viable, maybe not optimal but viable for sure.
---
But there’s a way to get classic back, and still make changes. It’s not TBC, it’s classic, but with the same endeavors to continue developing the game - but keeping it classic, in that the things that were changed to make it easier etc. just get nixed in favor of changes to improve basic class balance and add content (which are changes made all through vanilla)
---
Word
---
Skarm tank. Infra
---
Yes, that totally justifies genocide and breaking ties with allies when it suits you and overall being terrible.  I'd rather live in a mud hut than with evil bastards who believe they are better and good because they live in a city.
---
I know hunters are strong in phase 1, but what about when everybody runs in T3 ?
---
Maybe someone on a pserver could chime in. I see the quest is only to talk to what’s his name at the castle hill and turn in VC’s head, but you could be right that the quest isn’t available until the people’s militia. I’ll keep digging cause I actually need to know as well lol
---
Casual? Probably not. If you spend some time to really nail down the powershifting technique and farm Gnomer for a bunch of Manual Crowd Pummelers, then you can do ... okay DPS (prior to AQ, I think). If you're active in a casual guild, they're more likely to take you just because you're friends. But you're going to have to be on the ball to do moderate DPS (Leader of the Pack is a nice party buff if you're in a melee party).
---
You should let it gravitate you towards the trolls instead, who predated elves and are probably their ancestors if I remember. Troll the other, better elves.
---
Well that just means that rolling horde priest would be better then since paladins are more popular.
---
So horde would be better for priest then :D
---
“Mine wont even play little big planet” made me spit out my coffee
---
Priests are much more versatile healers. They always get my vote.
---
That’s fair. I’d like to continue the lore without recreating the following expansions. Just adding new content and making simple improvements like they did throughout vanilla. None of the flying mounts, LGR/LFR, arenas/arena gear, new races - all of those things that spread out communities and made the game basic and annoying, keeping it vanilla, but with new content

 You will *melt faces* as a *shadow priest* in pvp

More in need
---
Dwarf Priests will get slots on alliance
---
I had a 19 Dwarf Warrior and I was fucking owning with him. Was in TBC tho. Seems I deleted him at some point and he can’t be restored :( also had a female night elf hunter named Princess for what i got mocked by friends back in the day :p
---
The hunter was also incredible. I wasn’t good at raiding, so I was good at twinking :)
---
Rogues have trouble against mages ? (I had both as alts, but I very rarely PVPed with them).
---
I don't think that's why they're not doing RP/PvP at all. This is going to be an unpopular opinion but I agree with Blizzard's decision. The RP community is small, even smaller in the classic community. The worry with an RP/PvP realm is that it splits up the already small RP community and leave either server dead. I would rather have all RPers flock to one server if it is at all possible.
---
Another thing about RP/PvP servers is that they tend to be filled with people than don't even really RP but are there for the community. And that's fine, your choice. But I think Blizzard should prioritize the health of the RP community over those who wish to roll on RP/PvP. It's coming after launch.
---
Told you I was a loremaster.
---
I only looked at the wiki once, to remember how to spell Blackmoore's first name. ;)
---
God this is so fucking true. I couldn’t care less about the blue posts. I’m going to play it anyways. Just give us a release date
---
Hi, /u/-Boz-
---
That splits the speedrun into 2 catagories. Real time speedruns and ingame time speedruns.
---
I thought everyone else here was about 12-15. What with all the "dank memes" on the front page.
---
RNG would make you into an undead facing the wall in the cavern.
---
I know they're supposed to be melting faces but I don't see how.
---
They only have fear to break contact with melees and it's a long CD. 
---
How hard is it to get "the right gear" ?
---
It's hard to say without knowing what other MMOs you've played, but I have enjoyed both OSRS and Classic (Well, Vanilla private servers) both because of my childhood nostalgia, but also because I believe those two periods represent the best of those MMORPGs.
---
It depends how good a juggler you are. If you're just leveling skills in OSRS that aren't click heavy you could absolutely level on Classic at the same time, less so when doing content such as raiding (as would be the case with more difficult content on OSRS)
---
#EMBRACE THE SHADOW
---
Tri-force/basic mmo class: Warrior, Mage, Priest
---
Classes with flavor made to counter basic classes: Hunter, rouge, warlock, druid 
---
Faction*special classes*: Paladin, Shaman
---
Don't forget Mrglgl.
---
This is accurate. I will tell you this. If you roll priest on horde and actually cast dispel magic in BG's. You will have many giant shouldered friends.
---
&gt; If the community wants to have a competitive speedrunning scene for 1-10,1-20,1-30 etc. they should use a timer other than /played. Even if that means sleeping in the middle of a run. In some communities they require breaks for health purposes that doesn’t count against your times, this makes sense for Wow.
---
Maybe they could make the rules so that everyone has to play the same offline sandbox server thats modified to removed rested XP from the game.
---
Don't forget there will be a few lvl 60s in about 7 IRL days and they might want to level up their professions.
---
Its a pretty close fight if the rogue is hemo specced. If mage can find the rogue with a rank 1 blizz after a vanish its over for the rogue usually. If he has no cd too!
---
I decided to try to aggregate some of the lists that people have put together already. There aren't too many lists so take this with a grain of salt. Also, I probably missed some people's ratings that have since commented.
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
The process was to give each tier a point value, so:  
---
S Tier = 5 pts  
---
A Tier = 4 pts  
---
B Tier = 3 pts  
---
C Tier = 2 pts  
---
D Tier = 1 pt  
---
&amp;nbsp;     
---
So assuming B Tier is average, a value of 3.00 would be average in the table below.  
---
The Variance is just a measure of how much differently each person ranked each dungeon. A high variance means that most people did not agree on the tier for the dungeon.  
---
As an example to read the table, Blackrock Depths was the highest rated dungeon (4.50 average), and the most agreed upon rating (0.423 variance). Dire Maul was the least agreed upon (1.632 variance).
---
| Dungeon   | Average    | Variance     |
---
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|
---
| Blackrock Depths|4.50|0.423     
---
| Stratholme|4.29|0.527   
---
| Scarlet Monastery|4.21|0.643
---
| Zul'Farrak|3.93|0.687
---
| Shadowfang Keep|3.86|0.593
---
| Deadmines|3.71|1.297
---
| Scholomance|3.57|0.725

| Dire Maul|3.36|1.632

mining/skinning + herb/leatherworking to level, doesn't really matter which is which
---
As you level people will be selling leather for just above vendor on AH and in chat. And you will be able to craft things and vendor it for good returns. THere are charts for this. You'll figure it out. 
---
Then late game you do:
---
Engi/mining + Engi/herb (keep leatherworking until the price of leather goes up far enough you can't just buy stacks of leather off the AH and turn a decent profit crafting and vendoring)
---
There are a lot of ways you can make money at end game tho. And if you have profitable and rare recipes they can up end the conventional wisdom. Alchemy is an obvious one where you can make a lot of gold if you just buy mats low and sell needed potions at a large mark up.
---
Honestly, if I were to level with you, I’d tell you you will be disgruntled. I’m Alliance and when I played Horde, I felt like fish out of water, and I always believed Horde had it better in Vanilla - safe leveling till 30 (Alliance get thrown into contested zones as early as 16), Horde towns are better designed to not get griefed (look at Arathi Highlands - the town there is a joke, Horde can just stand at the top and intimidate people down below - whose idea was it to make that an outpost?). You have very safe and quick access to all of your major cities, even Thunderbluff - all you have to conquer is a walk through the Barrens - while Alliance Darnassus means you will either need a portal or die a lot trying to cross to or from the city to other cities at lower levels. 
---
So, you will feel like a fish out of water when you play Alliance, but it’s not all doom and gloom, there ARE pluses:
---
As others mentioned, better cities. Pallies are regarded as better raid classes for endgame than shamans, closer proximity to Blackrock Mountain which you will spend lots of time in. Idk if you are into the quest stories, but I love the Alliance quests, especially Elwynn Forest, Westfall, and Duskwood - I feel like the legend of Stalvan is alliance’s version of Mankrik’s wife in terms of infamy and being interesting. Deadmines is a great dungeon and I love the whole Defias story arc. Human racials are great for melee classes, Dwarf racial is actually on par with Will of the Forsaken imo, and Dwarf priests have fear ward. I suspect Horde will once again outnumber Alliance, which will mean lower queue times for you for PvP. 
---
There are pluses. There are minuses too. But probably MOST importantly look at it this way - if you have already experienced the game as Horde, playing as Alliance will make this game feel “fresh” to you. You will be able to somewhat re-experience Classic, not just re-play it, because to you, it’ll be new.
---
The vendor value.
---
I realized that! xD But i almost never look at pinned anymore because they always seemed to be ads everytime i checked. No hate :(
---
The real pressure is quest rewards for twink gear. Some questlines allowed you to complete them WAYYY before you are in the respective level range for the quest, and rewarded much stronger items than dungeons. Getting those done was a similar situation, where you let someone kill the mobs while you're in the location as a ghost, but you still got solid chunks of exp from the turn ins.
---
My 29 twink warrior was literally half a bar from 30 when I finished him. About a year or so of playing him, I forgot I had Cenarion at WAR and attacked the NPC, expecting to run away. Some level 60 killed the NPC and it leveled me. Crushing moment...
---
Is arcane/fire stronger than deep fire for end game dps? I would think the 10% all damage would outweigh the arcane benefits. Sure AP is nice but it destroys your mana pool.
---
So just use a few? What's the problem?
---
OK thanks. I thought since the mage was a clothie it would almost be one shot \^\^
---
Take your best guess for some week further in the future, for example in August. Then if release is earlier, you can schedule release week and have a week in August to game.
---
Paladin/shamy have by far the best group buffs. Any dungeon group that has them in them will be very thankful.
---
You can look forward to onyxia attunement Kappa
---
why 51?ish
---
Same here. I never tried wow until last year when bfa came out... It was pretty good, but different from what Ive expected. I played Tibia many years (oldschool times also), so I hope classic wow can give me some oldschool Hardcore feeling like back in the day!
---
I would prob, do Alch/Herb on the Paladin, and Engi/Mining on Warrior instead. Engi is so strong, even if you are tanking its bis.  
---
As for Disenchant, you can make a lvl 5.
---
I'll have to go back and look at engineering. I've never had it and really had no interest in it. But I have seen the 600 must have posts about it. I was looking at it from a steady buff each other and make some profit for my mount view. I looked at it from a view that besides the occasional blacksmith we would be pretty self sufficient.
---
Low supply and high demand.
---
My hot dog isn't getting noticed from the crowd, no matter how hard it's thrown at hey face. 
---
What do you mean I'm doing it wrong?
---
check out kris, full leveling warrior on YouTube not long ago, and good quest speed too :D
---
It really is the best part of Old WoW.  Me and my friends have so many stories from that time of just things that happened to us while out in the world, people we met, things we did.  It was truly a world that you could immerse yourself in and have experiences you couldn't anywhere else.
---
Hard to recommend rogue for anyone that wants to focus on BGs. There's a well known correlation between the amount of rogues in your pub group and your chance of losing. 1-2 rogues is fine, but they are the worst class to have too many of.
---
asmr 😁😁
---
Yo Tauren RP is one of the best RP scenes out there. Some respect pls. 😤
---
&gt;HP/armor of every enemy
---
Excuse me you fucking wot
---
Either that book isn't accurate, or it's some sort of worldshaking treasure trove of information for pservers. They've been theoretically operating on inaccurate boss armor statistics for years because they had imperfect information largely gleaned from Hunter skill inspections on Maexxna or whatever. If this thing actually has accurate, specific armor values for different bosses/monsters, I have to wonder how nobody has ever happened upon one before.
---
This. This is why server refreshes and the classic experience are so hot.
---
Certainly dont claim to be a master of the class by any stretch. Just enough to know right from wrong in most cases lol. 
---
Nor have i ever went beyond AQ40 so i certainly dont claim to have mastery over knowledge of endgame spriest meta.
---
Not OP, but I can help a bit.
---
If you’re referring to new content added to OSRS that didn’t exist in 2007, then I will say that it’s a bit of both. A majority of the updates are designed to fit with the old school feel, yet make it feel like a whole new game. It’s kind of like a parallel universe. In a good way. 
---
The community is polled, via in-game poll booths, on updates. The polls require 75% favor to pass or the content is altered, or scrapped altogether. So new content is very community driven, which has been great so far. That being said, there are still problems on Jagex’s part that r/2007scape will never cease to bring up 🦀.
---
There’s always plenty of drama in the OS sub, and it will likely be the same brand of disagreements and drama that will come of Classic Wow. It’s pretty unavoidable. No community is unanimous in what it wants. Not when you get into certain aspects anyway. 
---
As for how OSRS has evolved, content has either been designed from the ground up, specifically for OS, or old content has been refreshed to make it more relevant to the current game. Lately I’ve felt the focus has been more on the former, and I don’t agree with it when there are still old content that could be given new life. There is old, dead content that goes untouched because there’s no reason to. 
---
One more thing I’ll touch on, is that a lot of long time OS players are more efficiency focused than they would be back in the day, and it can ruin some of the fun. That’s something that makes me really excited for Classic, becauseI won’t know anything, and I’ll get to fumble my way through it, with every little mole hill achievement being my personal mountain.
---
I’d love a piece on Balance Druids if it’s possible!
---
Yussss
---
Completely forgot you only need level 5. That's a great point. I have a feeling she would enjoy flower picking more as well. We do plan on having a guild, so I can safely assume we will have a chanter and Smith for that. I personally don't look forward to engi, but have to go back and look at it.
---
Bad pull = you asked for it
---
Party of the vanilla experience is it predating empathy, since that wasn't invented until after 1.12
---
My father stopped playing 10 years ago. He stopped when Cata got released. Yetserday i talked 2 hours straight about classic, even going to a Talent calc to see the old Talent tree(it's been a while for him, i played on private servers).
---
I swear i never had dreams of wow, but this was the first time i had, my father playing a orc shaman. He casted lightning bolt. I don't know though if it was BfA to just play WoW until Classic comes out or if it was Classic, but 1st is most likely not the case. Let's see if this will actually happen.
---
I don't understand, that's what it says.
---
Yes thank god ! Josh im about to make my weekly 2 hour commute. Gonna grab a red bull, stock up on my juul pods and play some countdown. You have literally turned my commute into something i i genuinely look forward too
---
Sounds like an insane plan but best of luck. Personally I will probably hit 60 right around the time Naxx comes out
---
Sunken temple is easy to navigate after you do it like twice. It also gives really good exp for that level range that doesnt have a lot of other good options. Also there are a ton of bosses so theres a good chance of getting loot.
---
Every song used in every Vurtne movie is permanently embedded in my memory for the rest of my life
---
100% Agreed, it was more aimed at the fact that Rogues bring little else to a raid group beyond buttloads of dps and a few cooldowns to manage. Typically our MA's focus was to be on keeping the DPS on target, meaning to switch to Chromatics as soon as they spawn in my example, and calling out other (read: ranged) DPS if they weren't following his target. If he could keep his rotation for S&amp;D uptime and Evisc plus cooldowns, that was a plus.
---
Wasn't that species of Plainstrider only found in Darkshore? NO CHANGES!
---
well you're an adult now
---
do that
---
Awesome. Thanks for the advice! 
---
Would I have trouble getting into a raid??
---
Yea unfortunately we have to grind gold IRL too :(
---
Gl happy hunting, hope you have a dope vacation!
---
(it was a hyperbolic joke, brother)
---
/played is the objective best time.  
---
For the world first, rested won't come into it because it's a grind.
---
For world record time, it's more of a grey area. The speedrun community generally views a valid time as limited rested xp, unaided, etc.
---
there is no honor in stv
---
Take off in late July or early August.
---
The game will likely be out by that time and you can guarantee that your vacation time will be used playing.
---
Don’t try to guess the release date.
---
I don't get a vacation, though. That's the point. :(
---
Warlock. 
---
Edit: nvm, I missed part about having a lot to live for
---
Amazing art! Gnomes are awesome
---
I came here to say, you don't get excited about alliance.
---
Now i'm not sure if i'm going to roll alliance myself in classic. Making it even worse as i have yet to choose a class to play.
---
I guess there will be another thread like this tomorrow. Also the day after.
---
Master race!
---
hard
---
Ohh buddy, you must be new here.  You have some  courage posting this thread.  Best of luck to you
---
September.
---
Thanks for the info. So in the end it still is a matter of opinion. This is what i fear the most though, can blizzard deliver, and even if they deliver(assuming they do this) How will WoW community react? It sounds like a "new" game, which brings its goods and bads, been doing some research on my own, and it would seem more people are happy rather than not.
---
Then again i often see requests for True vanilla, and arguments all over the place. This is what i fear may happen to Classic WoW, and considering that it's the more popular game, who knows what effect it will have.
---
Im glad that you are happy with OSRS, but it's not the "perfect" vanilla+ content that many people think it is. 
---
In the end they are still different games, i just wondered how someone with more experience on the matter can answer some basic questions. Cheers
---
They do this in breath of the wild 100% for example.
---
Warlock is slightly more attention requiring than hunter but not terribly so.
---
Reading these tier lists, I'm just like I can't wait to run all of those.
---
I'm so sorry that you had to experience the awful misfortune of seeing a thread that was made... and it's really too bad how I tied you to a chair and forced you to respond to that thread
---
Good thing I ... dont ... have a ... fetish ....I think...
---
Take my upvote!
---
You think we'll take an entire day for that?
---
I wish I had the sort of wide-eyed optimism you youths possess.
---
You get disarm at lvl 18 (defensive stance only.) 10 seconds of CC ever 1 min is so strong. I also do plan to do some tanking as I level. There are not enough tanks to go around so it should be easy to find a group after I get all of the quests for the instance. Bonus points if I get good drops or meet new friends! :)
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
---
It's like, what else do we even have to talk about? It's up to us to entertain ourselves until July 19th... &gt;:)
---
And the day of...?
---
Thruppence an' a farthing m'lord?
---
Farming character should be a mage no matter what. They are just the best farmers out there, especially if you can pull off the ZG farm but that takes some gear iirc.
---
Best ‘twinking’ experience I had was a fresh Aus server released around patch 1.7-8ish. Bgs were out, so nobody had proper twinks. My friend group of 5 farmed corpse makers for my paladin and my friends warrior by running the dungeon at 27ish. Lucky it dropped from the first boss before mobs started to get too high level. 
---
Running wsg with corpse maker and everyone was super undergeared... we were absolute wrecking balls.
---
22nd.
---
Learn to Play, get geared. You will win most of your fights vs most people of any class.
---
Being a better player wins the day almost all the time.
---
Technically, four types of blacksmithing.
---
This isn't just for me.  I don't plan on having three leatherworkers and four blacksmiths.  This is for anybody interested in tradeskilling and seeing when certain things are going to start to drop.
---
The first day of snow.
---
Mage, warlock close second. Mage is the best pvp class by far don’t @ me
---
I like it, a nice stylish choice.
---
I never thought I would want to play a gnome so much before this
---
Oooh
---
Warlocks can solo anything a hunter can essentially.  At 60 you can essentially dot up an unlimited amount of mobs, 10 at a time, doesn't matter.  You'll stay alive through life siphon, the occasional spot drain life, drain soul rank 1 to proc mana regen from talents on dying mobs.  I think I used to run affliction with demonic sacrifice for the grinding sessions with a sacrificed voidwalker to supplement health regen.  Health = mana to keep going. You only stop to loot and respawn.
---
Happy to help mate, I love pods on a long drive too!

I was an adult when wow came out and the wife played then as well. We didn't focus on profs at the time. We played and had fun. Our guild was helpful, did runs, bgs, and enjoyed playing together. My question was asking about a good set of profs that her and I could benefit from when just playing duo. But thank you for your  incorrect assumptions and insults.
---
:O so specific... are you from the future?
---
So the first thing that I'd bring up in response to your post is that you won't necessarily be competing or even interested in the spell power items that dedicated casters will (Mages, Warlocks, etc.) In fact, there are even a couple Shaman only items in the first two raids. Beyond that, you'll want to be looking for mail gear that has stamina (your tier sets are a great start for pvp) and you'll definitely want a shield (a great one drops off of Ragnaros). The spec you'll play is 30/0/21 and it'll definitely give you the ability to burst down people but, at the end of the day it is important to remember that you are a support class: utilize your totems, keep your allies healthy, etc.
---
I'd use it on the mobs they're fighting to make them into killing machines that never flee.
---
This thread has me wondering if I was the only one who struggled to deal with fury/arms warriors as hunter.
---
vs War: bleeds and roots.
---
vs Rogue: faerie fire, roots, abolish poison, bear form.
---
vs Mages: charge, movement speed clearance, cloth armor
---
beats all 3 with ease if the player is skilled enough.
---
Bring invis pots, you'll be fine
---
Write this down i'm serious. You'll be getting camped and remember you have them in your bags and remember BelligerentBenny is a god
---
Classic is certainly closer to the OSRS feel than retail
---
Cause SJWs can't take jokes
---
&gt;My guess is July 16th, 2019.
---
&gt;It's up to us to entertain ourselves until July 19th..
---
Already changing your tune, eh? *Liar!*
---
Im ok with adding content that’s horizontal but it’s gotta be really subtle or else it won’t be classic imo
---
per
---
fect
---
I told my friends that I was going to play Mage because I am competitive when it comes to DPS meters but there is something about hybrids that I love. If I were to roll Shaman I would be ok with healing raids but I really want to be Ele in PvP. Can someone explain my life in 1v1s and bgs? I am aware of the ele burst but I want to know what it feels like beyond that.
---
Wonderful, thank you very much.
---
Wait... Do people know they're pockets very well? Is this knowledge I should have?
---
I feel like, with two plate classes, blacksmithing might actually be worth it. I'd go BS/Mining for one, Skinning/Enchanting for the other. No need to go out of your way to farm two types of nodes, can make gold with skinning, can use the BS gear or disenchant.
---
Think it's just the rare mobs? There's an entire Bestiary section. Haven't had a chance to look the book over a whole lot yet.

I accept your apology in the form of an upvote.

Oh nooo, dislexia strikes again &gt;.&lt;

I think the best part about the release of Classic is all the old memes presented in an updated format.
---
Yea being an asshole queing bg's without engi...
---
Typical pleb mentality, no idea what it means to be part of a team lol
---
Great feedback, when I did Smith it really didn't feel worth it. But with 2 of us, that's a great point.
---
Flasks, devilsaur set/leather, arcanite reaper. Rest are either cheap (some BiS healing cloth for instance), attainable by luck or BoP. 
---
Crafting and selling the AR can be valuable, but crafting it alone won’t cost much as the recipe is easily farmable.
---
Enchanting is profitable at every stage, problem is getting your hands on recipes like crusader. 
---
Alliance side will have higher prices for sharpening stones, since they use twice as many, for lack of windfury, worth a footnote.
---
Joana is considering a "hall of fame" on his website when Classic comes, where several records will be listed such as server first, best /played and maybe even fastest 0-10, 10-20 and so on - but i dont think it is 100% sure what he is planning yet. 
---
For the lvl 60 challenges, one of his rules are that the timespan is under 3 weeks, to avoid rested xp abuse.
---
This looks like Princess Vanellope.
---
Vendor price x 1.X or vendor price + X.

Usually to nice round numbers if +X, usually by round %s if by x 1.X

Let us pray they figure out how to get these servers running without 100 shards

I would run the other way
---
The reason you are getting ganked by 60s is because naxx is out and classic real soon, assuming you play on nd(cant type full name because of dumb rules on this sub).
---
Ooooh, early in the Summer! That's...
---
#BOLD
---
great read thank you so much. i will start looking up some more info from here!
---
If the rogue gets the drop on a mage they can ambush/backstab/evis (for five points if they have premeditation) for big damage. Mage is in a tough spot.. If the mage gets the drop on the rogue, it can be rough, but if the rogue has improved sprint and preparation they can basically break slows/snares four times in a fight with sprint and vanish. On my rogues I will pretty much always fight mages.
---
Do you saw my works too? =D
---
Im excited to grief furries.
---
It lets you drop defensive pieces sooner for ones with more str/crit for threat.
---
Yep, sure can't wait to see it drop on JUly 26th..
---
80085
---
there is tons of honor in stv, and i will be farming it
---
OH GOD ITS HAPPENING!
---
That makes sense. So I guess it kind of depends on what the class distribution at 60 will be.
---
No AGM. 
---
No Fishing Hat.
---
Using 2-handers, but not the BiS from the Hillsbrad questline.
---
Sorry, just had to do it. Nice twink nonetheless, easily some of the most fun I've had in Classic and TBC.

That's your fault then.  Don't get low on health on a PvP server.  If you're consistently finishing fights around 50% health then anyone can kill you.
---
Most of my memories from PvP servers have been wiping a guild that wiped us the week before, and then this lead to a month-long feud.  Fighting over world bosses.  Even when I wasn't going to be in on the kill, just showing up when a world boss spawns is tons of fun sometimes.  Coming out of UBRS and there's some Alliance on the ledge and you just brawl it out while ppl try to get into the instance before they die.  Standing outside DM:N waiting for someone to leave so you could go in to pick up buffs.  Sometimes there's 4 of you starting out and then you're the last one left to go in, back to the wall and ready to Charge anyone who opens the door.  Running up to ZG, Charging a Priest, hitting Bloodrage and then fearing a Hunter just to get killed close enough to the door that you can get in on next rez...
---
They said summer ain't gonna release it the day after the announce
---
This guy's level 8 paladin video is hilarious.
---
Why you can kite them forever.
---
Rexxar. Just me and my bear companion wandering about.
---
Right. I had assumed SS. Was higher priority, guess I’m wrong. If deep wounds overwrites it then the shaman will not be getting the full benefit of the debuff, but may be able to use the first charge if they are lucky
---
Pfft. Only a mainstream Democrat? I'm an American *socialist*. My optimism was a stillbirth.

Also RULE 5 MODS NUKE US QUICKLY

Its actually round. There is a globe of azeroth in uldum

---
Yeh I get 18h a month this month I rolled up to 83h accrued. So I now plan to take a few random Monday’s and fridays off to enjoy. But I’m definitely dropping 40-48h on classics launch.
---
I never stated I was queuing bgs with my guild. That's your assumption. 
---
Please explain how filling the role of tank is not teamwork.
---
Reading comprehension is a useful skill. 
---
Username checks out.
---
level 60s dont get honorable kills from level 30s, if thats what you meant
---
Queing bg's with anyone, you prick
---
You're on a team in the BG lollll

This is a good thing, if you want a culture of laziness, add summons to meeting stones. "pls smmn"

Check out episode #37! :) I may come back to it with a group call again, will see how things go.
---
Now this is quality
---
Hey guys Blizzard dev here.  We've been real busy working on classic for you guys.  Unfortunately we've hit a few snags.  We've taken a lot of feedback from the community and the general consensus is that classic WoW was too slow paced and frankly boring.  We've decided to enhance classic by adding some new features such as flying mounts and cross-server LFG/LFR.  Due to all the changes we've pushed the release date back to 2020.  We've also decided to make it a mobile app.
---
I honestly had no idea this many people have lives where taking 7-9 hours a day to play wow is an option. Jesus Christ. I mean sure, If i could do that I probably would. But my priorities are so so so different I guess. So many things related to IRL (partner, friends and family) leaves me with maybe 1 or 2 hours a day for wow maybe 4 days a week. I’m not sure if I’m jealous or glad that my life has so many wonderful things PLUS wow ofc. Weird. But damn, honestly, having 7 hours a day to play. Man right now, it would be awesome. 
---
Good luck everyone
---
Definitely going Undead SM Ruin Warlock main but Alt 1 is going to be UD Shadow Priest
---
What a waste of coffee!
---
You forget rogues can make extensive use of fear ward.

I also choose mankirks dead wife

---
Hi, /u/dilimnator
---
I believe Kevin Jordan will be doing this. You should definitely check him out.
---
This was on doomhammer!
---
The BiS 2-handers in the 19 bracket for melee classes on both sides almost made you level 20. The questline requires level 18 in Hillsbrad and gives over 1,5 level of experience just from quests. 
---
To become the most versatile/best twink, you really had to plan ahead and in some cases, you had to choose.
---
The highwaymen are up there but I'd say the bigger threat was the pillager. First real caster threat you encounter plus since they are so tightly packed together when they run they always pull more of them. Fighting them taught me the importance of interrupts and stuns.
---
It’s not even the easy xp that makes levelling mundane in retail it’s the literally fact you have 120 levels and only 10 talents, it doesn’t feel like you’re becoming more powerful quickly. A talent point every 15 levels can stretch it out and make it feel rough
---
Fine my guess is January 29th 2020 then
---
For the most part me and the community(as far as I’m aware) think the additions are really good and the devs have done a really good job of working with the players to retain that old school feeling. Thanks for the vid!
---
August 18! Just because...
---
Mage is convenient in every aspect of the game. You won't have trouble with anything.
---
Right before school comes back huh? That will be bad for some high schoolers..
---
Tell that to the undead warlock who let his enslaved infernal go crazy in Northshire.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Not at all.  There's plenty of people on pvp servers for whom pvp is not that big of a thing.  The reason they play on pvp servers is because of the extra danger and freedom it gives you.
---
I mean what is even the point of STV without the danger of being ganked?  I can't even begin to imagine what a different game it is to play on a server where people are 100% safe outside of their starter zones.  That's not warcraft, that's just bullshit.
---
You need to watch Failz: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el8TI5QrX84&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el8TI5QrX84&amp;t=5s)  
---
PvE will be healing. Orcbit will be an avid PvE elementalist but it's, you know what I mean... it's such a steep hill compared pure DPS. Except for dungeons. Elemental fucking rocks in dungeons. Key here is mana.
---
1v1 you can kill anyone if you're good. Your main problem will be warlock and spriest, but let's be honest, everyone's got problem with them. The fact that you can off-heal in BGs is huge. Shamans are PVP gods with huge burst and nature's swiftness which can serve as a lay on hands if you crit.
---
I’m trying to be one of the world first 60s on my server so I’m just blowing it all in one go
---
The osrs total level requirement is super low. Just enough to prevent mass bot voting
---
I find myself giving great weight to STV when picking my class. Anyone else?   xD
---
That would lead to a scenario by which, based on some randomized metric, even reaching the requisite 60k RP would not net you a Rank 14. It's hard enough to try and match CP points exactly, so really only a small number of people could even achieve this in theory as the complexity in matching points that precisely increases as the number of people trying to stack rank increases. No one is going to be cool with reaching 60k RP and not getting HWL/GM
---
Idk when phase 2 will come out
---
I really wonder if something is going to happen soon or they're going to lay low for a month or so.
---
I agree with you that they should really look at old content too like revamping castle wars and stuff. I try and stay away from all that efficiency scape stuff and just train skills in the method I like the best.
---
They will. They tank in fury spec. Just slap on a shield and you're good to go for dungeons. It's not like current wow.
---
Keep em coming, my dude.

https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bl9yzf/looking_for_group_monday_may_06_2019/
---
Yea bro a lot of us are out here with no SO and few if any IRL friends. WoW (arguably all videogames) is a form of escapism for us. Don't be jealous, the grass is not greener over here lol.
---
You poor sod. My dreams always include the release date. Unfortunately they also include the NDA, so I can tell you.
---
Why not a Friday? Seems like a great day from my standpoint
---
I don’t think you should be making judgements about a game that you haven’t play, nor have much experience of. Currently OSRS is in the best state it’s been in since it’s release in 2013. It has the highest player count, and most subscribers. The new content doesn’t just require a majority vote, it requires 75% to pass, and people will be hesitant to pass content if it doesn’t fit the “old school values”. Also the official game forums are barely used, and aren’t a great indicator of player satisfaction.
---
People can make an argument that weekly updates aren’t “old school” when in reality, back in 2007 (the time the game was taken from), there were weekly updates. New content is part of the old school feel. 
---
While I’m not sure how this applies to classic wow, I feel that a few months after the last phase if nothing ever changes there will be a decrease in player count. Obviously there should be no changes to game mechanics, classes etc. But I feel if we can get 75%+ people to agree a new raid might be good after a year of the last phase, then it might be healthy for the game.
---
Fucking NDA
---
I am looking for a 2-3 days a week raiding  guild for classic wow. Being the Main Tank I am planning on hitting 60 in the first 2weeks and start gearing to prepare for MC and Ony.
---
I have played Vanilla-BFA and have raided top end since TBC-Legion. 
---
Looking for a guild that has a good community but also gets serious when it’s time for raids. 
---
Horde NA PVP
---
PM for more info.
---
I’m not worried about my own view on racials but more so the raid leader. Completely understand I could just keep moving on till I find a raid that lets me in. I was just wondering if I would be gimped come raid time though based on my choice.
---
Lol.  Literally pinned to the top of the entire reddit.  You're going to the bargain guild buddy
---
Yeah, they are around but from what I understand, their population was decimated so having 500 players roll them on a server makes no sense.
---
very nicely done
---
Enter stage right, phasing. They have a real chance of making me immediately uninstall classic if they don't shut it off in the first day.
---
leveling priests with spirit tap + wand spec with bis wand and all +spirit and it's the easiest class to lvl

I've never even played on a pve server. Friends got me into the game a few months before TBC released. Rolled on a PVP server to play with them. Had a blast.
---
That seems pretty hype honestly! Its something to consider for sure
---
If I'm correct in assuming you're the goblin guy: I followed you too! Hahahah 
---
I also saw you around my timeline before! Unfortunately not as much as Anzka's stuff, but it's never too late to fix that! Wishing much success to you both. ♥
---
‏
---
This is why "Blizzlike" pservers lasted as long as they did and "custom" or post Vanilla pservers were limited in number and population - people just wanted Vanilla.
---
I'll admit back in the Vanilla days there were a lot of changes I advocated for and were happy with, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.
---
I'm under no illusion that Vanilla was perfect (An illusion! What are you hiding? FML), it has its problems and awkward design decisions, however, a lot of those quirks are what made it what it is. Again, hindsight and all that.
---
It's one of the reasons the only changes I'll advocate for are bug fixes like pathing for pets, for example. Fuck you, follow me where I walk you mindless little imp!
---
I definitely don't want to see any changes to the game or additions. I don't want to see TBC or anything beyond Vanilla. There's not enough people that stay for those shitshows on pservers and it would only serve to kill the community, with many turning back to pservers for Vanilla.
---
I'll take all the bad with the good all day every day. I also want to be able to break for a few months at a time and come back like I never left with the game being the same as I left it.
---
If folks think changes will be better, they only have to look at how barren any "updated" pserver is in comparison to any "blizzlike".
---
I mention pservers as I feel they are a useful metric to see what people gravitate towards and what folks don't like and it's abundantly clear that "no changes" is the best and safest way to go, any improvement or addition be damned.
---
I've heard of this OSRS and it intrigues me
---
Will be interesting to see if they give us TBC an OSRS like product or nothing
---
I'm thinking about the level 1-10 quests, which give huge rep. 
---
In your guides occasionally you advise farming wolves or something until a certain xp breakpoint to ensure faster leveling. 
---
I wonder what the optimal route for only getting quest xp is do you can get maximum rep out of the starting quest areas before greying them out. Seems like it may save you time in the long run?
---
I should clarify I suppose as arcane frost is not the same as arcane fire. In fact arcane fire is deep fire if we’re talking about the standard 17/31/3.
---
Lol. I said huge announcement, not astronomical

Druids are faster than warlocks. You spend more times running than actually fighting where cat form comes in handy. Warlocks big strength is having 0 downtime.
---
I was actually just thinking about this earlier today.
---
I wonder if it's possible to make an addon/macro that would attempt to cast every rank of a buff from highest to lowest in a split second.
---
If you want "new" content you should stick to retail.
---
August 27, still technically counts as summer
---
You won't be gimped unless you want to join a hardcore min/max guild. I believe having the off Nelf rogue in the raid is great because they will be taking daggers which none of the humans will want.
---
I'm not quite sure you understood the nature of my post.  I'm not asking about what is valuable, or in demand, or anything like that.
---
People are already putting together phased content pre-raid bis lists.  For gear.  What I am asking is for a phased content item drop guide for tradeskill recipes.  As in, not everything is going to be available at launch.  Things are added to loot tables later on, and entirely new content will be opened up which includes new loot.  Some of this loot will be tradeskill recipes.  It would be nice to get all this info down before launch so people know what to expect when, just like with armor and weapons.
---
I'm still debating on what I would want to play, but I'm learning towards Druid currently, as I'm not sure what my friend/group situation is going to be.
---
I'll mostly be doing smaller group content, 5/10 mans and BGs/random PvP.  I'll dabble in 40mans probably, but I don't have any plans to start organized raiding again (destroyed my pure, youthful, innocent high school relationship with progression raiding in Vanilla/TBC) as I have a wife and kids now, but more than likely will have friends that still will, and might jump into a raid with them on occassion.
---
That being said I'm really torn on what spec I should go for Druid.
---
I had originally planned on doing Warlock as they are good solo, can pvp well in both open and BG environments, do well in 5mans and raids, and are usually sought after for utility items which makes it easier to get into group content even as a solo player.
---
I feel like Druid will give me those same things, but allow me to perform different roles at the same time, which is helpful for someone like me, an altoholic.  I know the 0/30/21 is the primary raiding/pve spec, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go all-in on only being able to Tank or Heal.  I don't mind either of those things, although I know the healing in classic is a lot different than any of the expansions (as it was less HoT focused).  I'm also not sure if I'm ready to be only healer/FC in pvp, but maybe that is an inclination Druid isn't the best choice for me.
---
I also thought about doing a deep feral spec, which would still allow me to tank, but also be able to do somewhat reasonable DPS (I know I won't be top on the charts) and presumably have more solo viability (farming, etc...).  I hate the idea of farming MCP, but I don't know if I'll ever even get to a point where that's necessary.
---
So I guess my question at this point, is what is the best all-rounder spec for Druid?
---
Is it possible to be a true hybrid, in that I can dps, tank, or heal with the spec (albeit at mediocre levels)?  Or is it really a choice between talenting for 2/4 specs (I've pretty much written off Moonkin tbh)?
---
Yea att least some word about when they expect to get back to us would be nice
---
IMO I wouldn't consider any records set on private servers valid. Too easy to cheat.
---
R.I.P.
---
I replied to a comment that has been deleted, not yours. You are doing great!
---
Rogue leveling is honestly not that bad, just hemo kite stuff and you'll be fine.
---
Lmfao
---
This was gold
---
I think some mechanics should be up for change, for example, druids should be able to proc weapons while in cat/bear forms.
---
What’s TBC?
---
Just because I am always looking for an excuse to show this fight to people: [https://youtu.be/L\_gdBds7CSc?t=168](https://youtu.be/L_gdBds7CSc?t=168)
---
Paladins.
---
Can you do a "no boe filter" that isn't default and must be clicked? I just think there's a reality of almost complete certainty 99% of people won't get the boes. It would be good to know what the non beos were.
---
I know your vision is "bis", it's just a bit wonky in my opinion.
---
How has no one said Marin Noggenfogger? He's essentially every players drug dealer (first ones free). Makes good money off everyone's addiction and as an added bonus gets to see all the insanity that goes on in gadgetzan. This is a no brainier for me at least.
---
what would be a good PvP druid spec?
---
Thanks bro! #classichype
---
Nice I was on thrall, the guy who uses doom hammer I think 😀
---
Thanks for the info guys 👍
---
First expansion
---
The Burning Crusade
---
Really? I have to explain to you? 
---
First, I stated I was a warrior. It's pretty safe to assume that I have tanked based on that. So you telling me I don't know what teamwork is does not make any sense. This is further reinforced by you stating that being a tank either in a raid or bg, is being a part of a team. I include being a tank in 5 mans as being part of a team as well. So you are incorrect saying I don't know anything about teamwork. That's supported by your own words. 
---
Second, I never said I was a pvper. You've taken it upon yourself to assume I was. Nothing I said indicated that. That's where the reading comprehension could have been useful to you. You've been making all your comments circle around bgs. That's your focus, not mine. 
---
Third, you stated your opinion to my question, thank you. And have since turned this into a back and forth about bgs. Bgs have nothing to do with my question about leveling profs as a duo. 
---
There should be no need for me to say more. Hopefully this sums it up.
---
Do we know if the male dwarf can do the wall jumps like most of the female characters? Really want to play male but don't want to gimp myself
---
Lmfao thanks homie. When you dropped that knowledge bomb i was like....yep bit out of my league here LOL
---
TBH being in a raiding guild overall do take way longer time then you think. IDK if its different today but first of all you need high attendance to even get invited to raids so you need to be available at whatever raid schedule multiple times a week, and when you weren't raining you are expected to farm resistance gear fire/nature if you just did mc/aq and after that you needed to farm for consumables so the play time hours quickly add up if you do want to raid.
---
Mid august.
---
Is this what a stroke looks like?
---
I don't get what the point of this is. That not 100% of the people want changes?  Ok I guess.  But the idea that people are going to 100% like the game as it isn't after 2 years is also unlikely.
---
You will have a population in game that is likely to shift to being heavily warriors, probably around 20% overall, in PvE druids will be played by very few people because the mechanics don't support them and neither do their gearsets (aside from resto, which has limited utility due to hots not stacking).
---
People will realize that ele and enh shamans don't really have a place in the game at all, as this isn't 1.4.  People are fine with that now, but will grow unhappy with it as time grows.
---
We'll see.  There is something about a game that doesn't change, good factors and bad.  Just like with every potential change as well.
---
More than you think.
---
There will always be those that level faster than you. The gold per hour they earn just leveling is often orders of magnitude above yours. And the people who are focusing less on gathering are precisely those who will be higher level with the money, and demand, for materials.
---
Mats sell. Maybe not day one, but definitely by day two or three. Especially consumable mats from herbalism and mining because those who level fast are going to have an eye on engineering, alchemy, etc... And but mats is always cheaper at the beginning than weeks into a server when they ding 60.
---
It also happens to be the time when at low level you are cash strapped.
---
TLDR: you can gather for profit even from the beginning.
---
What day of the week?
---
This is the whole point. If 50 people in a row want alliance, they cannot play on this server. Why because this process is addressing FACTION IMBALANCE.
---
The point of this thread is mainly directed to people that simply know about "OSRS" and think that's something like that will surely help Classic. Its about a how even in the very game they use as an example, the arguing between people and the potential of slippery slope exists. I didn't make it to pretend i know the game, i made it to show people that it's not as simple as they think
---
Im not saying OSRS isn't a success, im not attacking it. If sound like this in the OP, then i apologize.
---
I see the numbers are fine, but are they fine because the game kept the "vanilla" part or because the changes pleased crowd that wouldn't play otherwise?
---
These are 2 different groups of people, and you can clearly see that some aspects are indeed changed, or removed. Its not a question of whether i play or not, this isn't the point of this thread.
---
Also we have TBC, or potential fresh servers, Blizzard isn't Jagex, their income isn't directly related to Classic.
---
This raises other questions as well, because in the end, its different games and different developers, but i don't want to go there.
---
Im highly against forcing this on everyone when it comes to Classic (if it's even in), i don't know how much a community can afford to be split. But one thing is for sure, people argue, some people don't like changes. Even if most of them do, leaving the rest to deal with it isn't right.
---
then you definitely shouldn't play vanilla
---
One of the Spirit Healers in STV, just to laugh at the people being ganked.
---
Locks are weakest against warriors.
---
I'd like to counter point by saying BS is trash and just reach 60 asap and you won't need it anymore.
---
Druid is good against all 3 of these in blue gear. In high end gear however druid will struggle against all 3 as well. You definitely won't be beating a naxx gear warrior with ease even if you have the best gear in the game as a druid.
---
Gnome art is best art
---
That's like saying you played center in your elementary school gym class once and you know what team work is.

You were a tank and not engi??? ???? ????

And an adult who could read and understand what the tooltips meant? ?? ????  ? ? ?? ? 
---
Being on a team is all about doing your best, and one of the great parts of MMOs is everyone can play near the ceiling. Your wife, my grandma, me, and you assuming we can move all our fingers pretty well. 
---
ANyone running around not solo with as a non engi is an ass and doing his team a disservice. That's how they designed the game. Period
---
You trying to get out of your lazy snake behavior isn't gonna work with Benny

not to mention shapeshifting breaks pretty much any CC a mage can deal out (aside from constant frost bolt spam, but even then it still helps a bit), and also being a shapeshifted form, you're immune to poly.
---

---
What are your guys opinions on Troll vs orc (female?) for hunter? I'm not really interested in the racials, more the animations. I never played horde so I don't have alot of experience with it. I'm considering trying to figure out how to get on a private server just to see the animations in real time. That dressing room is awesome, but it doesn't really give me a sense of how it'll look in game.
---
I'm hoping to get around 35-45 hours a week in. 
---
No idea what class ima play. Originally pally to heal. But after lvling one to 30 on a pserver and contemplating suicide not sure if I can follow through with it in classic. 
---
Having a blast on Hunter tho. Maybe lock. Maybe mage. Maybe rogue/warrior. All classes I have maimed at one point or another in my 13 years of wow.
---
The game was harder. MMOs thrive off the sense of accomplishment. When you achieved something in vanilla WoW you felt it, unlike now where the game has been made super causal friendly.
---
I do agree with that as well. I failed to level it in tandem with my char. So it was never useful to me. I thought it was a good point though because I do plan on prof leveling effectively this go round. It is pretty safe to assume that most of the gear is equal or less compared to rewards. Thanks.
---
If I decided to play classic I would love to go through the process of getting benediction on my dwarf priest again.
---
Either go heart of the wild/resto with nature's grasp, balance/resto or majority resto.
---
Why won’t it work?
---
Nobody has said why not. The only thing disputed is my background in IT, which is not even mentioned in the op
---
OR you roll on with 4 and really push your characters /classes to the limit and try to finish without one.
---
It can create some interesting, albeit time consuming, situations.
---
Ibwouöd not call it free. You can still kidney instead of evisc and if he is alive after evisc you just vanish into insta cheap.
---
Orc is my preference. Totally up to you though.
---
no, im gonna be that level 30 killing other 30s
---
I just got the worst imagine in my head; imagining if there were no level minimums on max level buffs.
---
See a smiling lvl 14 gnome warrior running by.
---
You cast max rank Intellect on him.
---
In the time it takes for the little animation over him to play out, his smile suddenly turns into a grimace as; screaming, his head expands to twice it's size before violently exploding. 
---
He falls forward quickly as it happened so quickly that he didn't even have time to stop running.
---
The guards are stunned. 
---
The children stare in horror.
---
Donna forgets that Betsy ever existed and ceases chasing William.
---
Neither of them leave the house anymore.
---
I give you Intellect.
---
It's a hack&amp;slash but with the crap combat of an MMO
---
Soon
---
Yeah but maybe they're the conspiracy theorists there. insisting the world is a sphere.
---
Jimmy or any of his friends can simply choose the faction in the beginning for the character creation process at which point the algorithm is updated. If he or his friends select a different faction the algorithm is updated. 
---
If he clicks out, well that’s the same if you clicked out of the que to login in when a server is busy. Or it’s the same if you step out of an actual line, you are now out of line and must start from the begging. 
---
Or have you never waited in a line/que?
---
I hope you're right.
---
Wishful thinking has me put it on friday the 16th of august because it's my birthday and vanilla released on friday the 11th of february in EU. However most of WoW's releases have been on tuesdays, so the 13th or 20th is more likely in my eyes :p
---
Isn't azeroth judt the continent in classic?
---
Alright I'm hoping for the 16th now too for your sake!
---
There is no conflict here with any of the things you mentioned, ESPECIALLY UX. Stop posing. If there is a conflict spell it out specifically or gtfo
---
I don't want that at all.
---
when he picks up the phone LOL
---
This is more the camp I’m in since I know I won’t get what I want. Honestly the uniqueness and quirkiness of the game is what I fell in love with in the first place
---
Hi ScopeLogic. Welcome to the minority haha
---
Not sure... that would be cool though
---
Haha nice
---
... til the 60s arrive. Or 3 rogues chain distract you :/
---
I’ve been thinking about trying a high armor soul link build for pvp. Just become unkillable against rogues warriors and hunters. 
---
Do you happen to have a list of any other cloth pieces or trinkets with high than usual armor?
---
I love the assumptions Benny, I honestly do. My wife can't move her fingers as well as everyone else. She's a upper bilateral amputee. 
---
I never stated that I'm looking to be an elite player on my server, I never said I am dying to raid and top off my character. I was asking about mutually beneficial profs that would benefit her and I as a duo as we play the game from the approach we desire. 
---
I appreciate those that are so dedicated that they math out everything before changing gear. That put forth the time to be guild best, server best players in their respective roles. I never said that's a role we are wanting to take on. So if you could answer from the point of view of a casual player looking to enjoy the game and have profs that make things just a little easier, that would be great.
---
What I'm asking is what is the point of diluting class/mount abilities for the sake of convenience in an RPG? By making everyone capable of the same shit it basically removes the "role" from roleplaying game, its just... game.
---
If you're dedicated enough to get the PVP gear, you should be fine. It will take some time, yes, how long? For you, i cannot say, it all depends on how good you are and how much you play. Also, if you roll engineering that would help too, just like any other class looking to have the edge in PVP.
---
Retail wow is similar to classic
---
Starwars: Knights of the Old Republic
---
Interesting... I mean yeah as an option would be great but I feel like that would be harder to make (Blizz side). 
---
I definitely don’t want anything extra added, I just want it to be cleaned up a bit
---
I want to have a successful guild run by myself and 3 friends....it will be successful if we can clear MC or ZG. That’s about as far as we got in vanilla so I’d like to achieve that.
---
Anything more is a bonus, but hopefully we don’t have to join someone else’s guild.

I can still hear that quote, clear as day, in my head.
---
Big true
---
Crossbow from Chromaggus is faaar better, you should aim for that instead.
---
Imagine being pent up in a tiny cabin with 4 other people, for eternity.
---
Nothing, and I mean nothing can even come close to classic wow. I mean, the game is perfection.. The game is so good, I'd blow a homeless dude for a release date..
---
So no, no other game gives me that feeling.
---
Well then all the more reason to carry her
---
you snake
---
My goal is release date
---
Classy. And for clarification, people without arms can walk, they don't need to be carried.
---
Ah yes, every software is released with the idea that max load will be hit in seconds. This is why no game is released with any issues. /s
---
You don’t anticipate MAX LOAD because that would cost MAX MONEY. If you had worked on any project, which you haven’t since you are a student learning python, you would know that though you do run stress tests for max load, it is not feasible to address it. 
---
Does activision have enough money to address this? Yes, most probably. But activision operates in the realm of possibility, and has tight control on budgets and manpower that have been determined by people who many not be involved in the actual process of development. This means that it is run by people even more clueless than you. 
---
Being roasted over a small flame for something like this usually falls into the hands of PR and crisis management. If you could even call this a crisis as almost every one of their game releases is shaky.
---
Well, again, this is only the theoretical intention of people before having any contact with the game besides the Blizzcon demo. I think it's impossible to say it'll stay like that for sure, but it gives you a headstart of what to expect.
---
I had a pretty mediocre friend on his 40 something Hunter regularly kill skull level Warriors. He did have an epic gun though. I think it was precisely calibrated boomstick
---
Goldshire Inn.
---
&gt; **RFD** RFC and Gnomer worst dungeons ever.
---
But ***ZOMBIE PIGS!!***
---
lol "carry" is a video game term for you as a better player helping your teammate
---
"carrying" them
---
I can't believe you just said that
---
Haha thanks :p
---
I get that, nothing can come close to firing up that first rock of crack.  I just wanna chase the demon in a little different way.  I have to go buy a cpu (don't even have one anymore) for when vanilla comes back out.
---
This is Gif is Legendary and fits PERFECTLY
---
What the population of the game will be in 2 years, and how dead it will be, depends on one thing.
---
How much people blizzard want it to have, and for what reasons. I can guarantee you that it will never die. If it indeed is intended to be a museum game, blizzard should not care if it has 100000 players or 1000. Dead is subjective and if we judge by Pservers, it isn't dying anytime soon.
---
You brought some points, no answers. You fix one thing but you break another. Then the forum and opinion wars begin, which is the point of this thread. Its not so simple. 
---
That class imbalance you speak off might end up as being something so crucial in the grand scheme of things, that a simple balancing could bring the whole mountain down.
---
Broken itemization is the PILLAR of why vanilla content was viable. Everyone being a warrior is a bottleneck by itself, you bring 20, good luck gearing them, same goes for every class. I didn't make this thread to bring points that were discussed to death. I made this to show you the main problem, and that is he war that will ensure once changes start to come. 
---
also Re-read this part....
---
The Voting system is flawed, at least  that's the impression i got from reading for a while. Even if 80% think  that its the better change, the 20% that remain might either have to  quit or deal with it. How does that affect the game then? Well, by  changing something, even if you get 2 players and lose one, it  eventually turns into full circle, meaning that people come because of  QoL changes or new content.
---
If these  changes start to stack on top of each other, the voting becomes biased  and the game inevitably loses its "Vanilla spirit". The player that came  after 1 year of changes, will not vote based on the Vanilla RS, that  player will vote based on his experience 1 year AFTER vanilla, therefore  making his vote biased, because that player technically didn't play  Vanilla, he played something that evolved from vanilla.
---
Im standing by this for one major reason. WoW is an extremely popular game, it will bring people from everywhere , and if this happens to apply to them, the game will have nothing to do with Vanilla in less than 3 months.
---
i played it for like a week before putting it down for good. bought into the hype too much because of a friend at work. never again!
---
Lmao the way Dwight's cousin runs is so hilarious

Can you also tell us how big your penis is? It must be huge, and definitely bigger than all of ours!
---
Hmm maybe it was the Pillager I'm thinking of, one of them was the mob that had the most player kills for a long time. I'd be okay with being a Pillager too, for sure.
---
Don't miss the point of the thread, it exists to show you this exact problem. "My change is fine", im not saying it is, but that's just you. What about the rest?
---
Is it considered a foot fetish if you wanna step on it?
---
Is there a link to the VOD?
---
I mean, it doesnt make sense for there to be that many blood elves either but they're the most popular race in TBC. Same with Draenai. It was only a small group that landed in outland compared to how many people roll em.
---
I think if they were added after naxx you can make the argument that they are repopulating and that's why there's more running around.
---
Haha sorry about that. But I feel like the content should stay even though you weren’t the intended!
---
Naxx isn't out on my server.
---
Nailed it!
---
lol my vanilla experience wasn't on a pvp server. I can't wait to be not on a pvp server again.
---
You only made the comment because she is an amputee. So it makes perfect sense. If I never mentioned her you would have no reason to comment about me carrying her. How are you not seeing that? When your loose insult is based off me saying she's disabled then your comment has everything to do with her disability.
---
Is that still going strong these days?  I don't have a cpu anymore but I guess I'll have to get one at some point to play vanilla again.
---
I personally cannot wait to never ever see the word "hype" again.
---
If I roll Hunter probably about the same. 
---
Pally would be to not wear full fucking cloth gear. So probably pvp set as I won't have time to commit to a t3 guild
---
I’m think earlier July. 
---
Based from the demo last November everything was running properly except for minor fixes, so there can’t be anything that is holding up development right now.
---
Also, it’d be moronic to release it right before everyone goes back to school. I’m just hoping we get an early or mid-summer release.
---
Hello. I am a returning vanilla player and can't wait to dive in. Alot has changed since then and since I have a newborn, 6 months, I am trying to figure out which class to choose.
---
My playtime is obviously cut down by 90% but I would eventually like to get into a raid here and there. Hopefully I find a chill guild that understands that I will never be on time.
---
With that said, any recommendations for a class to play? I'm leaning towards mage mainly because I played it back in the day AND they aren't as crucial for raids. I could sub in easier, rather than a healer.
---
No i said it because you have a wife who doesn't have hands and you should be doing everything you can to help her and your team in whatever context that is get through your little adventures
---
Snake
---
Be engi
---
And don't be so fucking sensitive we're talking about a game that involves hands. It's gonna come up
---
Lol do you mean a computer? Because you need a cpu or else it doesn’t function...
---
Me too!
---
Funnily enough, there's a set of PvP gear called the "Defiler's/Highlander's Intent" (Horde/Alliance) which boasts some of the highest-armor known to cloth in the game. But besides that, nothing else stands out. When it comes to Trinkets, you only have 2 options: the \[Mark of Tyranny\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=13966](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13966)) and the \[Smoking Heart of the Mountain\]([https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811)). I failed to mention it in the video, but Rings are also a source of armor, and there are several options. The 2 highest armor values with Rings are tied for +150 armor. You can sort items by "+armor" on \[this\]([https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.0.11#0-6+1](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.0.11#0-6+1)) database.
---
Just don't get too cocky around them Spell Hunters!

But can zombie pigs even oink?

Loved Too Human

Source?
---
&gt;judging a fight and whether to stay or flee, fun exploration, slow yet meaningful leveling systems and just a general feeling of being a noob in a big world and having a steep yet satisfying learning curve.
---
This describes Dark Souls to a tee, which is either my favorite or 2nd favorite game/series, alongside Wow. Starting with DS1, the game does very little to hold your hand. You have to decide where to go, and what armor/weapons you want to use. There’s a deep RPG element with level-ups, but you can’t overlevel the content if you don’t learn the tactics of the game. There is a steep learning curve that you may struggle to get past. There may be spots where you have to bash your head into a brick wall for an hour or two, but once you kill that boss? You get the most rewarding sense of accomplishment and new bits of world to explore.
---
I've raided endgame PVe on a priest on both factions on private servers,  and we always have a pretty even amount of priests(4-5 holy and 1 shadow after patch 1.7).  I will say that the the Horde priests have slightly more responsibility because they are the only class on Horde that can dispel magic,  whereas Paladins on ally have a dispel that costs less mana so ally priests are rarely on dispel duty and just have to worry about healbotting and fearward mostly.
---
I highly doubt this. They're going to put all the quest hubs in from the beginning.
---
I want tier 2 and I want to at least participate in the Scarab Lord questline since I came in at the tail end of vanilla.
---
it is known
---
Zalgradis lmao
---
You're thinking of SWTOR, the starwars MMO. That game sucks. I'm talking about the old-school Xbox game. Has PC and mobile ports available now and couldn't feel more vanilla
---
In other words your just farming karma by circlejerking about "no changes" despite your attempt to seem like you're open to discussion on the subject.
---
The problem with your argument is that the "Vanilla experience" will never be able to be recaptured.  Vanilla was a game that evolved constantly.  Classes were nerfed and buffed, content was needed and changed, etc.
---
The idea that 1.12 is "classic" and there fore infinite and immutable is ridiculous.  1.12 is just a slice of the vanilla experience, and while it was closer to balanced than previous ones it wasn't that close.  
---
The fact that the game is constantly changing is something they tried to take into account with phases, but even then, unlike in vanilla, the phases had different power spikes.  Now we're going to have overpowered warriors for at least 2 years.  It seems fine now but we'll see how long that lasts.
---
The truly foreign thing, though, will be after the Naxx patch and what will ultimately be a realm without changes.  That will be very un-vanilla in and of itself.
---
Ist he a mod here ? Name sound familliar
---
Is this what pvp looks like on pve servers?
---
Have you seen the AI image upscaling people are doing for older games? Somebody used ESRGAN to upscale a lot of TES: Oblivion textures so they're a little crisper and less soupy and pixellated, but obviously still the vanilla textures. I always thought classic could use that treatment, as the cartoony hand-drawn textures would upscale well with ESRGAN, waifux2, or something like that. And that wouldn't cost more than the time it takes an employee to train the AI and run the image through.
---
Ha yeah that's what I meant. I don't have a laptop or tower anymore these days.  My ps4 has a cpu so I guess I do have that.  Long day at work here getting me all loopy lol
---
What pirate hat is that in top right bag?
---
12 new guilds since last time I checked arount 1 week ago.
---
It's a warlock
---
I love his content and high quality non-content. I hope we get a whole leveling series for Classic, maybe Zaluzaran 2.0 or otherwise. It would probably take 8 years though.
---
What a terrible fucking rogue LOL
---
But this is why you roll orc.  RNG chance to just break the stun chain and turn the fight completely.
---
So not only does the rogue need all available cooldowns, but also needs to hope that he/she doesn't also get unlucky.  Not a good matchup.  This of course doesn't really play out the same against a resto who lacks that burst damage, or enhance who lacks the armor and is susceptible to not landing a hit with evasion.
---
Much better stated first comment. 
---
Snake comment is pointless. 
---
I'll be what gives enjoyment. 
---
Not recognizing a comment the way it was intended is not being sensitive. Flipping out over it would have been. Yes, her disability will come up, not worried about it. 
---
We done?
---
What about the rest?  What does that even mean?  
---
You think people are going to have an actual argument as to why druids shouldn't be able to proc weapons in forms?  No.
---
They just want to stand by their "no changes" stance because they think everything is a slippery slope.
---
I've played a few from the DS series and Bloodbourne as well and they're just not my thing anymore although I do appreciate them for what they are.  I've thought about checking out the new DMC also.
---
Insight gained
---
KOTOR is available on steam, if you haven't played both of them I highly recommend.
---
SWTOR is the MMO, and it's changed a lot since it released. I haven't been super into it since the 2.0 update, I'm in the minority that liked it just fine in 1.x.... It's a very story-driven game, with voiced cutscenes and stuff, I personally think it's worth at least one playthrough, especially the class stories.
---
Someone's playing 'let's see how many down votes I can get with a single comment!' lol
---
Well done!!
---
I’ve been stuck on Sekiro atm. Not very far in it, but I’ve already taken week long breaks like 3 times.
---
Level 20 paladin quest lady in Westfall. Sweet farm on the ocean, super secluded, and hunky warriors of the light coming to save me from thugs all day. Can’t beat that
---
Plus you could be intelligent and the second anyone zones into Naxx you send every fucking boss to them instead of letting them leisurely pick off your crew 1 by 1
---
Understand completely!
---
I can't remember for sure, but I definitely feel familiarity with the idea that there was a time before it would auto-downrank. 
---
A cold, sinking grief and realization occurs as you watch them die, a moment too late to open your spellbook. 
---
The red text across your screen mocks your well-meaning attempt.
---
Oh okay. God this just got me more excited for it
---
When people talk this dramatic they are talking about future aq40/naxx guilds. Rest of the raids are easly done by casual guilds before the big consume fests start to happen and minmaxing is required.
---
That said, the real "Crowning achievement of raiding" is to Kill Hakkar with all Aspects up before AQ releases!
---
If there are too many healers I bring a DPS class. Shaman doesn't fit that mold.
---
What you've been told about druids is incorrect. Less players play them, demand is normal, they heal just fine.
---
Thinking about not picking a druid for a raid spot is going to seem silly when you see them filling out raids and getting geared up really fast and still healing/decursing really well
---
&lt;Deus Vult&gt; Horde, PVE
---
Who we are: We are an 18+, English-speaking guild.  Our officer core and many of our raiders are seasoned WoW veterans who have cleared end-game content across every single expansion.  Retail isn’t doing it for us, so we are forming a guild for Classic.
---
When we play: We raid from 8pm to 12am PST (11pm to 3am EST).  Raid days are Friday and Saturday with future 20mans on off days.
---
Loot system: We are using a Loot Ladder system which rewards good participation and ensures fair, transparent, QUICK loot distribution.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes, especially fury warriors, rogues, warlocks, holy priests, and resto shaman.
---
For more information, send me a DM.
---
Warriors ideally beat hunters, but if you can avoid hamstring and have pet melt warrior its over. The best warriors blow fear on pet to avoid that dmg and intercept out of traps. Its a waiting game of trapping warrior after they blow charg/intercept and you win
---
This sir, sounds interesting. I would love to see something like that in WoW.
---
Thank you for telling me about this!!
---
Death to All Talls!
---
Absolutely, I am totally on board with you there.  Using new gear to balance specs would be great.  They could even make gear that only gives bonuses if you are spaced 31 points into a specific tree so that hybrids dont rival the pure classes by using sets in weird ways.
---
Sure that limits some creativity but it would keep hybrids from becoming mandatory while also balancing out the class specs that are too weak.
---
Either case I think we are on the same track of thinking. :)
---
I really dont think it will be that bad until phase 2. Everyone will be rushing to ding their first 60 and side tracking with pvp offers zero benefit aside from having fun with it. And if you're having fun with it you aren't rushing to 60 so you wont be there when the bulk of players are anyways
---
Mana regen ticks every 5 seconds. If you are drinking you are increasing that tick. If you just "ticked" and 1 sec aftee you start to drink. You have to wait 4 seconds for the next tick, this tine empowered by drinking.
---
But if you drink 1 sec before the tick you also get an "empowered-by-drinking" tick. Than you walk for 3 to 4 seconds and drink again just before the next tick.
---
You can walk between regen ticks but it will cost you alot of drinks. So before doing stuff better fill those bags up with more than 2 stacks.
---
Until you have full tier 3 then you pvp until your kids put you in a retirement home
---
So as a Druid myself who has gone back and forth many times on my exact spec Ill tell you what I landed on and why.
---
I am going https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxxosfMdtV0b with 2 points Ill be honest im not 100% sure where I am putting them, but leaning towards natural shapshifter.
---
So why this spec? In the guide of all guides for Druid tanking: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Only 3-5 fights in all of vanilla should a Druid not be tanking or DPSing. That means healing is just rare for a feral druid to do. So skipping on healing talents like improved HT time aren't as important.
---
The spec I choice has all the important Bear talents for dmg and threat, I do lose a bit of armor, but that is ok in my mind for shred cost. This build also allows powershifting. It won;t be as good as a pure dps feral build will be, but it will be close. This can Tank or DPS perfectly fine. And honestly for me the healing factor doesn't matter much since in the 3-5 fights many of those are just spamming decurse and abolish poison.
---
[This is probably the main one](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMLoZVE0oeoVo).  
---
Natural Shapeshifter, Feral Charge, Swiftmend. Basically it's all about kiting/healing which are druid's strengths and most useful role in any sort of serious pvp.
---
Makes me think of that guild forming post I saw on the WoW forums. Dude was expecting to get 30-40 people to 60 and raid ready, and to down the first few bosses of MC before the first weekly reset.
---
Lvl 14 orc hunter, I'd love sticking my arrow in you. Please make me quiver and I will mark you with my barrage...
---
My guess is after 5-6 months
---
Heck yer
---
Ya. Ignore stats.
---
How does a hunters dead zone work with a Taurens extra melee reach? Like is the dead zone for a Tauren hunter only a yard?
---
https://i.imgur.com/FaLcmQ2.png
---
ok
---
You have no argument either, you just see something to appear broken and are quick to fix it, ignoring the whole picture. "the rest" means that EVERYONE has some change in mind that is different. 
---
When you give me a solid answer to how you balance RPG based classes without breaking any of the following aspects, for each class separately.
---
Leveling.
---
Soloing.
---
Mass pvp.
---
Solo pvp.
---
Dungeons.
---
Raiding.
---
Then you can come and tell me how the slippery slope is false, because all the classes combined + the types of content i gave as an example, required 15 years of developement and it's still not perfect. The only think that changed is heavy homogenization, loss of identity and massive pruning.
---
Give me an example how you simply fix classes, go on.
---
Peace keepers lol
---

What if everybody on this subreddit rolled the same server?  Like the first PVP or PVE server that starts with the letter [X].  Even if you got half this sub on the same 2 servers I feel like it would be pretty cool.
---
Any of the Darkmoon Faire NPCs, that way I only have to work one week a month.
---
I don't think there is a way to get all the feral dps and tank talents while still getting NS in resto. Maybe 0/33/18 with no +threat or +armor talents. I think you are going to have to pick 2 roles and stick with those, though dps + heal might be rough. (Not sure if 24/0/27 would give you enough dps, maybe 30/0/21 with a bunch of cloth gear.)
---
Doesn't seem like i farm anything. I know it wont be recaptured, is this your excuse to push even further?
---
What's with the "it was evolving" The moment it evolved through TBC, vanilla ceased to exist, therefore 1.12 was final. I've seen this attempt to boost dumb arguments used together with things like "well uh, game is changed, you got raid trade loot, therefore more changes are fine because there is already one change"
---
You say slippery slope doesn't exist and literally gave me an example of actually slippery slope?
---
This is great XD
---
Outward
---
QS day 1 of phase 2 release
---
It’s fine for a fresh launch since the competition is universal. When you’re talking about a world record later, it’s impossible to emulate properly and therefore you should use something other than /played. If you don’t, it can be easily beaten by someone who executed the exact same but chose to sleep one additional hour every day.

No one wants to play fury either :P

I feel like my goals are in phases, with the first one being simply to make it to level 60.
---
Then I want to join a Guild (or maybe join a bit earlier) and start running 5-man dungeons &amp; get raid ready.
---
Then I would like to start raiding. 
---
So I guess my ultimate goal is to just be a raiding Warlock.
---
I also want to make a lot of gold &amp; I've not really thought about that too much. But it'll involve playing the auction house &amp; choosing some professions, which I'm still not decided on. I might do Herbalism/Alchemy. I might also do some hardcore fishing. I just don't know yet.
---
I just don't want to burn myself out or feel like I get to the point where I am logging in without having anything to do, ya know?
---
So I was hardcore horde. The first time I played alliance I didnt have an issue until pvp, First kill was an undead mage the sound made me feel sick to my stomach. Didnt expect that at all.
---
Regthar Deathgate. Sent endless adventurers to kill centaur, then sent them to Desolace to kill some more, AND trained Kathrena Winterwisp.
---
oh my, I think I’m obligated to report this as NSFW

&lt;DCT&gt; (Horde-PvP)(CST) 
---
Guild intended for a mature audience, 18+. We like to do everything. Just a bunch of friends that have played together for years looking for like minded people to enjoy Classic with again or for the first time. We like to kill and chill.   
---
What we ARE: 
---
* Casual but will progress steadily, will see ALL content
---
* Social experience  
---
* Experienced players 
---
* Understanding of real life coming first
---
What we ARENT: 
---
* Hardcore 
---
* Overly critical 
---
* Quiet 
---

---
Raid Times: Thursday, Sunday, Monday 7-10pm CST  
---
Loot: Loot Council unless a better alternative is allowed in Classic, final decision will be made upon release.  
---
Recruiting all raid slots for now, and once more join we will narrow the list down.   
---
We will world PvP a lot and just do Vanilla things. Pretty active in Discord, typically always someone on talking. Server will be decided on once Blizzard finally releases names.  Reach Out: BNET / DISCORD **Partycity#11663**/**BigClayton96#4957** **HeavyT#1516** / **Heavy\_t22#0056** if we feel like a fit for you.
---
With the updated items there will be a lot more casters this time around and less rogues.
---
Not interested in one night raid, but we can world PvP together sometime if you want
---
I'm with Phillis, just gonna quest in Desolace
---
As do I 
---
Troll Rogue reporting for Duty
---
Some rogues might get butthurt.  Especially if your the healer.
---
Really the only way to dps as a druid is with an all out feral dps spec. To dps as a cat and not waste everyone's time you need Omen of Clarity and LotP. You can't do that and have ok healing. This tank lets you tank as well.  
---
Really your choices with druid are 
---
1. Healing Spec (deep resto)
---
2. Ok tank, Ok healing spec (Hotw)
---
3. Tank/Dps (deep feral)
---
4. balance pvp/healing pve
---
Enhance/Resto shaman here.

Played WoW during vanilla but only made it to 29 as a hunter because I wanted the Harpy Claw Bow that was a world drop so I farmed harpies for 2 weeks before quitting. Eventually, I made a mage to 60 and got the full warlord's set and just spammed AV but I have no recollection of leveling that mage, just pvping.
---
I plan on no life'n classic when it releases for at least the first week. I'm super laid back and just want to play for fun. While the aspect of being the first 60  is appealing, I'm also willing to run dungeons and just experience the game for what it is. By no means am I a tryhard elitist. 
---
I have about 12-15 IRL friends rolling with me but we'll all be playing at different paces for sure. I suppose we'll make a guild but we'll all be in Discord together anyway.
---
If you're down for a bunch of clowns geeking out the first few weeks, feel free to PM me your info when classic is released and we can party up. 
---
PS: not looking to hookup.
---
Thanks man! 
---
I’m most likely rolling dwarf now.
---
Night elfs are best alliance tanks until thunderfury, so thats a good start.  Also hunters have a lot of fun with meld.
---
You’re going to level and work your way through dungeon content somewhat painfully and that will make you think you stand a chance of tanking in raids. What I will tell you is yes... you will see the inside of raids. You’ll just be forced into healing and be behind the gearing curve 🤷‍♀️
---
boobs are timeless and infinite, age doesn't matter. (for the men i mean dont call fbi)
---
So what your saying is you are going to toss a shield over it?
---
Totally agree
---
There's a great explanation of this somewhere... someone did the math, I just can't find it now. The gap becomes more important the further the game goes. In the beginning, there's barely a difference if you use edgemaster.  If you're a rogue, you could easily go combat dagger.   
---
IDK I agree that shadowmeld is so good/fun of an ability that you should consider it. The small percentage of overall dps is just... are you going to do naxx? No, well, it's OK.
---
That one rare-elite Murloc that patrols westfall's shores... Spend my days just walking on the beach and cracking lowbie's skulls open.
---
FFXI . The CoP Era servers are like the real thing as far as I'm concerned. I played FFXI when Vanilla was big. So, I'm excited to be able to start fresh.
---
QWE restricts you to basically just 1-6, and then rtfgd for hotkeys... alt is easier to click maybe, and I guess maybe f buttons, but on my keyboard they're further away. Esdf you have qwa, rtygh, 1-7, and even \z vb all available to keybind. For me it's the best set up since I don't like having 2 alter buttons (shift and alt), alt and control and there for rarely used binds but otherwise shift with these binds + mouse buttons is more than enough.
---
Furthermore I don't like unbinding back, its rarely used but if you're tanking and need to reposition its a lot easier. Also if your in pvp against something you need to be constantly parrying/dodging.... its not a completely dead bind. Also just grinding mobs as melee, you might want to get closer to the next mob, but you're not killing this one fast enough to need to run.
---
Just climbing the tower, when it's already been there for a bit. "Make it. Make it. Make it. Make it. Make it."
---
Definitely druid, we straight up counter these 3 classes in 1v1 and you should beat them 9/10 times. With that said druids are a hard class to master and you will have to learn how to play properly before you can do anything.
---
July 9th
---
This is ten times better than the usual stale memes.
---
Let's see what the longevity is for classic wow. I am curious what the population will be after a year being open.
---
So she rolls a Druid and can try to keep your dumb ass alive.  I married my healer back in ‘05.
---
What... it's the most played class and spec in the game?
---
Smartest man in this thread
---
I’m loving these gifs. BRING US MORE! Please.
---
Very true, I guess the only one suffering from that scenario is me lol. But the customization bit stands, and we all shall feel the wrath of indecision.
---
You knew what it meant
---
Don't be a snake
---
Should have gotten some nice food instead. That's what I do when I get cravings
---
And in the end, no-one really answered my questions...
---
Yes its a rant but maybe someone is on the verge of doing the same mistake and reading this could save his/her soul
---
Cry me a river
---
It took me 36 days played over 6 months to hit 60 (so 4-5 hours a day average playtime over that span)
---
I expect I'll be lucky to shave a month or 10 days played off that time, but I do expect it to be lower since I know wtf I'm doing now.
---
Joana is working on the alliance version of his guide right now, and says it'll probably get done before beta.
---
Undead or Troll shadow priest PVP?
---
Thought he has an alliance guide
---
Il on a diet :/
---
That’s true and I could not agree more. But if the rogue has every cd up and blows it on a duel it is usually lights out.
---
Not a PvE geared rogue vs a r14 Shaman, though. You actually need to burst the Shaman down by surprise to win.
---
Priest is the only source for dispel on horde, so horde definitely need priest the most. Alliance got both paladin and priest for dispels.
---
I'm not entirely convinced your advice of "Never lose health when playing WoW." is a realistic strategy. Though, admittedly I'm not a super pro vanilla PvPer as you clearly are.
---
You shouldn't even be touched by a warrior as a druid if you get the opener on him. Naxx gear I agree, dps classes in general get crazy and shit on all healing classes. But BWL/AQ epics you can still easily shit on these classes as a druid. Assuming you have AQ/BWL epics too. Here is monkynews getting sh't on by a PVE druid, now imagine what a PVP one would do to him [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJgRZbxg5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJgRZbxg5k)
---
You looking for something like this ?  [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/)
---
A good rogue can be 1 of the most influential bg classes in the game. You can flag carry, peel, and might be the best flag return class as well. The only problem is that they don't do as well in large group fights because you can't really get on the cloth without getting peeled or killed. So usually too many rogues can be bad for the mid fight but a couple can be really big. They are also the kings of world pvp.  
---
Hunters tend to be better at group fights and playing defense. They are also harder to be good at imo.
---
Lol "We need strong ganking classes. Like druids... or other rogues".
---
That's such a Dwight thing to say. That's awesome man.
---
I miss knowing members of the community. Hating specific players of the other faction. Envying specific players of my faction. Having duel rivalries in front of IF. Such feels.
---
I mean if it has accurate boss info then that would have been a huge game chaver 2 years before classic announcement, hevk it still could be!
---
I don't even get what you're arguing.  That every change means everything has to change?  That any change will make the game come toppling down?
---
Yes, changes to classes will affect class balance.  That's kind of the point. 
---
You seem to be approaching this from the perspective that presupposes that any changes to class balance would hurt the game.  Then you use that to point out that any change will cause a change to class balance and hurt the game.
---
The point isn't to fix everything with one change.  And Vanilla wow didn't fall apart every time blizzard initially changed classes or mechanics.
---
Blizzard doesn't have to change literally everything suggested either you know.  I'm sure they will use their own discretion in changing anything if they do ever go down that path.  
---
The idea that I suggest that druids being able to proc in feral forms means that someone else gets to take down the house with his suggested change is just silly.  
---
In the end, 1.12 wasn't the be all end all of class diversity or balance.  It wasn't even close on those.  Yes, classes now have homogenization problems, but they've chosen to go down a specific design path that led there.
---
Damn thats so fucking stupid. 
---
This happened to me in Cata when I was topping meters with 1H Fury, they booted me for not being Arms. I was #1 DPS in every fight in that Twilight Raid. 
---
People actually would boot you for playing the spec thats benefitting the entire raid instead of going with whats “norm.”. Thats what I mean by elitism.
---
Logic fails you. Horde has tremor totem. Alliance has fear ward and nothing else.
---
Sounds like you haven’t played long enough on either if you don’t believe me. 
---
Or at least not on Area-52, Illidan, Zul’jin US, Horde Side.
---
Bless you u/provosorisk and these bountiful memes
---
Stealth!  Equip dagger!  Gold, Jerry. Gold.
---
lmao oopz
---
You just grind in AV.  It's not any different than PVP servers.
---
Just my opinion but classic, or cata is easy to get into.
---
That is exactly me right now.
---
Made my day.
---
Kudos
---
both have their merits.
---
shadowguard procs blackout and is probably better.
---
devouring plague is a nice cooldown that does a heap of damage but can be dispeled
---
Me...   I needed this.  I might have done it too
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
He might die too
---
July 16th is still 68 days away :(
---
Resto shaman is highly sought-after and there are never enough of them for raiding. They are strong and fun, you won't have issues getting invited to dungeons like resto druids might since they can't res. Personally I would choose a druid because I like the jack of all trades playstyle and I think I would have much more fun being one than a shaman, but I would suggest shaman over druid to anyone else.
---
For a bank alt: What is the fastest class to get to level 5 and to Ironforge?
---
Both Soul Link warlock and Shadow Priest are amazing for world pvp.
---
Yeah well I lose most of my Apex games and it's still fun
---
In vanilla my guild only saw one of those.
---
You dont have to worry about that, you might start alone. But you will meet many friendly players along the way to 60, you wont be alone.
---
i think someone likes the office
---
much better than expected lol
---
Okay...
---
just go on a discord
---
Go to his website, joanasworld.com I think it is
---
Had 7/8 never got the helmet from Onyxia. Also had Rok’delar.
---
Nelf hunter? Pfft be a man and roll dwarf instead of shooting them in the back like a damn goblin.
---
As Murk said, you aren't going to see much of a change. Rank 14 grinders don't care about whether there's world PvP because they won't be taking part in it. They'll be in BGs 16+ hours a day, every day, for months. Since there will be cross-server BGs from the start of Classic (unlike in Vanilla), you won't see any change in overall kills. The only real hangup, if there's a hangup at all, is that it's best to grind in a Rank 14 premade group, and it will theoretically be harder to create a competent Rank 14 premade PvP group in a PvE server.
---
DPS shamans werent even close to the same level as hunters or druids in group PvP.  Enh/Ele shamans rarely got invites to premades.  Hunters were staples for premade groups.
---
This but I wish I could get together with all my friends and play a 16 person lan party in the small back room of a sweaty humid card shop again with everyone getting a quarter of a crt
---
gnome lock, plus if you get him to 20 you can make him a summon alt for your guild.
---
It's 10%, you could do the math to verify if you were able to do grade school math.   As for the rest, are you legit mentally ill.
---
"Good features"
---
I don’t agree. Classic is the base model they chose to release. Similarly with old school RuneScape. 07 was the version they went for then expanded the game from there with a separate dev team and weekly polls to decide the content. I’m hoping blizzard ( although unlikely) may adapt a similar technique. Would be harder to do with the nature of expansions being much much larger.
---
Rank 11 mount and killing Kel Thuzad
---
Unless you get into totem twisting, and you probably shouldn't unless you are enhance in pve, pve shaman is pretty simple. You set down the buff totems for whatever fight you are doing and then cast lightning bolt or healing wave. Pvp is a bit more complicated because you have many niche totems that have uses in pvp but it is more about just knowing what each totem does and picking the corresponding one. Buff totems aside from windfury are usually used less in pvp because they are killed easily and they only cover a set area.
---
Lock has more utility and better scaling damage throughout the endgame. Hunter has better damage at the beginning of level 60, but the only real utility they're bringing to raid is tranq shot. Yes there is trueshot aura and wolf buffs if you want to count them, but they are not the reason anyone is bringing a hunter to raid. Also maybe ice trap. I think hunter is the hardest class in the game to play really well, it definitely has the most involved pve rotation of any class. Lock is going to apply a curse and spam shadowbolt like there's no tomorrow. But lock has summoning stones (praise jesus) so that's always good since meeting stones don't summon in vanilla. Personally I'll be going hunter, I like the fantasy of it way more and I know that the number of good hunters will pale in comparison to the number of bad hunters (learn to dismiss your pet and turn off auto-growl, seriously it's not that hard). So I'm not worried about finding a decent guild even if most of the better guilds will only take 3ish hunters to raid.
---
Technically, the 13$ you spent may be usefull for you when you will play Classic (if ever Classic is released within a month urk urk urk)
---
No. Once you confirm, they are there until you respec. You have to pay for a respec at the trainer, then you have a blank slate the same as in vanilla. The only difference is that you can add and remove the points as you want until you are happy with your build. Once you are finished, then you confirm the talent choices and then they will be active and permanent until next respec.
---
Haha yeah
---
sylvanas is hot, don't even
---
If I go warlock, what’s the best race for horde and alliance?
---
No, i desire shadowmeld afk benefits. Love to run away behind a tree, and feign death n shadowmeld. Love to equip a hydrocane and do it in the water. Shadowmeld is love, shadowmeld is life.
---
Pshh pussy
---
Yep, went from the tiered system to being able to spend honor points on the gear. Kinda made everyone have those weapons right before tbc lol
---
Stats huh.
---
Looking at dps in a vacuum is disingenuous. 
---
Hunters don’t “drop off” or “stop scaling”. Purely they don’t scale as hard as warriors and rogues from a 1.12 perspective. Getting less crit per point of agility is a big factor as well as stat allocations being wasted on crap like intellect, lack of weapon options etc. 
---
Shit was different pre warrior and rogue patches anyway.
---
BWL/aq40 released before both so the harsh reality of a 1.12 game in an aq40 setting never eventuated back then. 
---
But we’re getting a 1.12 server so sure, hunters  will do less than their physical counterparts in later stages. 
---
Which 95% of people won’t see. 
---
Hunters do more than adequate damage through all tiers and being mandatory utility. 
---
Cool stats tho.
---
Tips is still a dickhead who never played vanilla and certainly never raided through  its real time line.
---
It actually would work fine, because it would count the account as Horde and it wouldn’t matter if you had 1 character or 10, it’s Horde because you can only have one faction per realm in classic
---
At, or less than, vendor value.
---
So basically, just vendor it. If the herbs are rare or useful past lvl 30, hold onto it to sell once people actually have a few gold to throw around.
---
Female dwarves are CUTE. The lore is Alliance-centric when it comes to Vanilla. The Ony attunement is easier on Ally side. Paladins. You’re not a barefoot mongrel crouching in a mud hut. There are a lot of pros.
---
BC and no 40 Stam leg enchant?
---
Glad it helped, be patient because its not worth it
---
Dwarves are pretty down for the cause.  Kill anything that doesn't have a beard.
---
what about the phase becore av?
---
and also is it sligltly easier on a pve server because there are less pvp'ers in general
---
Well a man can always dream....and be disappinted
---
That would be interesting. And I don't know if I'm against it. I personally would rather see "horizontal" progression at that point. Content yes. Increased item levels, no...
---
Ya. Literally didn't say any of that. Good job being that dickhead classic elitist tho. YOu DidNT RaiD iT In VaniLLA DOeSn'T maTtEr 
---
Clearly you didn't watch the vid. He literally States everything you just said.
---
Lets aim for MC and BWL...
---
The stress and agony saved in ZG alone from Berserkers that can rapidly wipe a raid is worth being dwarf.
---
The upsides to the other classes don't even begin to compare. A Naxx BiS human priest might have a 30-40 spirit edge on a dwarf. Big deal, you get a small amount of regen (and spell power if deep holy). I'll take the spell that can totally change an encounter.
---
Key word: Shortstack
---
So it'd be nice to have some kind of indication "I want to be ally in PvP world" and it recommends  servers to keep some kind of balance?
---
How is he flying? #nochanges
---
There will be enough people who don’t want to be in a big guild to make weekly pug raids I’ll bet.  Time isn’t always the requirement, if you are racing for progression then this style will not be your cup of tea, but if you meet a few people who know what they are doing do random 1 night raids you could make ok progress just 1-3 hours a week.  
---
If you find a bunch of good players who have done the vanilla raids before even better.
---
Hunter or another mage or warlock. This is for world PvP. Assuming the worst case scenario, a rogue opens on you, warrior charges you, mage gets a poly off. 
---
Only mage, hunter, and warlock can really reset the fight or fight from behind.  Getting opened on unexpected as a druid in caster or cat form is too much to recover from unless you have engineering stuff ready. Mages can land a CS or timely block or a blink and poly to reset. Locks can Death Coil and go from there. Hunters can FD trap or scatter and feign. 
---
In duels druids would be good though.
---
Can agree there(if I knew the split)
---
I had a 19 paladin that I made purely to kill the 60% Dodge rogues. I had an eternium shield Spike and spell power enchants to judge them to death...
---
Im sorry to find this bit of hypocritical but then again im used to read these words for different things since classic was announced.
---
What i got from that post was this. "Not everything is supposed to change". It sounds fine doesn't it? Thing is i still cant find one simple answer, or maybe 2.
---
Which change is the right change?
---
And why a team that is completely different than the one from 2005 can pull it off?
---
""In the end, 1.12 wasn't the be all end all of class diversity or balance. It wasn't even close on those.""
---
Oh it was. TBC came after it, therefore 1.12 was the last part of a whole game that we call vanilla today. Therefore it's the end.
---
If TBC was called WoW 2, what then? Does your logic apply again, or we are playing psychology game here.
---
Would you say that if I perfect hunter rotation+weaving, get the necessary items and consumes, a hunter can be top ~5 raid dps in MC/BWL?
---
I found it much easier to find friends in the game, regulars on my server that i'd see daily, get to know, group with them a couple times, add them to friends list, ask them to do dungeons whenever you do one, etc.
---
Easy peasy.
---
I'd go with the dancing trolls in that hidden village between Felwood and Darkshore.  They very well could be drunk, we don't know.
---
Lmao.  Well other than that, they can't.  (Unless there is another crazy method, hunters pet luring maybe?)
---
Mage for both imo. Not having to deal with soul shards for raiding is a godsend and mages stack better than warlocks in bgs. Tailoring is nice later on for the bloodvine gear from ZG but other than that I don't think they do anything amazing.
---
My hero
---
Cross server bg?
