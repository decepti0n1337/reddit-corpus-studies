I used to have a very similar spreadsheet where I also had an option to put in the prices for mats and the completed potion, but I was stupid and deleted it years ago. Having all that manual oversight made me real sad over seeing the puny margins I was working with on that server.

Dwarf for alliance

Undead for mud dwellers

---
I fixed it for you!
---
It can be useful for levelling, since warlocks tank damage, you can have a melee swing with a firestone proc in between spell casts for extra damage
---
Thank you for your service &lt;3
---
You're the one asking for a community-run blacklist, not me.
---
For alliance, dwarf 100%. It just makes you 100-0 horde rogues.
---
For Horde i've always played undead for the looks, but orc is just better, and heres why, your pvp trinket already dispell fear, but you can't dispell stuns, theres more stuns in vanilla than fears and alliance warlocks and spriests are underpopulated, resisting HoJ, cheap shot, 5cp kidney shot, warrior charge, hunter pet intimidation, engineering grenades, blackouts from priests can win a fight for you, and you also have the attack power racial bonus that you can combo for more burst.
---
You forget Viper Sting has no cast time and no cooldown. So the Hunter can just wait out your cooldown and lol-instant-cast it again. It's ridiculously spammable dumb spell and one of the few things I hate about Vanilla PvP.
---
So you accept that we should be making this game more casual and that retail is the proper end game for Classic?
---
[removed]
---
This is awesome :) Make one for Warlock? I pay you with happy thoughts?
---
Thanks bro yeah exactly. Amore math way of saying it is:
---
Aimed shot/Mana cost of aimed shot = multishot/Mana cost of multishot
---
But you get multishot at 18
---
Need priest is King at Wsg . Shadow melding on 3 different floors healing the flag carrier .
---
So is SP Hunter a thing?
---
Class first: Do you wanna cast spells and deal damage from afar or hit stuff up close? Do you wanna tank, wield big weapons or dual wield?  Do you want to cast spells; healing or damage? Big nukes or lots of dots? Do you want to manage a pet? Do you think Druid forms are the epitome of coolness or annoying? Does the idea of a free level 40 mount factor into your decisions? 
---
Maybe that doesn't work.. maybe you need to pick a race first because how you look is most important. Personally I'll always be Alliance cos Horde look like shit. Maybe you don't mind, maybe you like how they look?
---
Do you care about gear and raiding, or getting the best PvP sets? See how these sets look on different races. Personally, I was stuck between a Fury War and a Rogue, Fury Warrior BiS looks like pure shit so I picked a Rogue cos their tier sets look awesome.
---
You have a point there. Dwarf is the god of rogue vs rogue if the rogue doesn't insta burst you down. Is insta bursting down someone from 100 to 0 even possible in a rogue vs rogue?
---
"Waaah don't tell me how to play!" comments inc
---
So was the blood plague, that was changed.
---
No...he is saying the bat is comparable to the owl in Westfall but the bat can be obtained faster if you are horde since they are in Tirisfal Glades which is only a zeplin ride away.
---
Westfall is only close to Humans who can't even be hunters
---
No Alliance city can offer the same breathtaking view that Thunder Bluff can. It's picturesque.
---
Hot take, it won't be like that at all if 2007scape is anything to go by. Turns out, no one is new any more and everyone just rushes to end game rather than enjoying the experience.
---
&gt;Is insta bursting down someone from 100 to 0 even possible in a rogue vs rogue?
---
Like I said, with shit gear its very unlikely you'll burst someone with cheap shot/kidney shot only, you'll want to blind them and reset the fight, that's why I said dorfs 100-0 horde rogues, they can reset the fight whenever they want, but horde rogues can't do that to you because you are a dwarf.
---
&gt; but a good Rogue is going to see that youre casting Star Shards and not bother.
---
While taking a mighty 800 damage over 6 seconds. Hear me roar!
---
Dude legit do you read? 
---
As it turns out, in vanilla, there isn't a toy to learn all flight paths from level 1. And getting from teldrasil to westfall (by walking not flying), takes longer than running from gromgol to westfall.
---
2006: high school “nerd” studying to be a mechanic and going through an apprenticeship while playing a ret paladin in vanilla.
---
2019: travelling the world working in hospitality/tourism....dealing with latency issues depending where I am in the world trying to connect to US servers to play with friends.
---
It shows all the skills that you can train at each level. It's useful for when you're far away from town, and aren't sure if it's worth going back now or to wait.
---
You seem triggered.
---
I was planning on leveling in the night elf zones as a gnome mage.  I was looking for something like this so I can plan my training since I'll have to hearth to IF all the time.  Hoping I can just do it like 3-4 times before I hit 20 and can port easier.
---
I next to never bothered with Flamestrike as a mage, but I was predominantly frost.
---
I suppose that it *could* work with Shatter's 50% critical strike chance after a group Frost Nova right before Cone of Cold as I've since seen some mages do, but at the time, I never thought to work it into a rotation.
---
That cape clipping
---
If you're just going by "coolness" factor then Undercity wins that title hands down.
---
thanks for the help
---
in vanilla it was, on pserver they deliberatly nerf SP scaling on both hunters and rogues. how blizzard would do it, i cant say.
---
Man, it's just spells but also such a Good, motivating progression path. Great idea
---
I forgot about Thunderbluff. Yeah Thunderbluff and Mulgore command awe. I mourned the coming of Cataclysm by going to Thunderbluff and Mulgore to admire the original zone.
---
That's a good way to punk some rogues that don't appreciate the power of retribution aura. I actually killed myself once when I didn't know what that Aura did... The Paladin was also getting pocket heals but I didn't know what buffs came from what classes back then so I was totes unaware of the priest hiding in some shrubbery.
---
I should make one for the pally....oh wait thats like 4 skills and even thats pushing it...... :/
---
Stoneform is not why dwarf priests are good.
---
That may be true in tier 2.5 and 3, but a mage will do much better than an equally geared lock in MC and the beginning of tier 2 before ZG comes out.  Mostly due to lack of hit gear
---
Really nice screenshot! Also - how awesome is it that they're named "big bad pauldrons"?! So direct, right to the point, it's just what they are.
---
Not at all, I know they're the best for pve at least for warrior which I intend on playing. 
---
I said that because even though humans have good racials, I see them as pretty  inconsequential compared to something as cool as this animation since I'll be seeing it all the time.   
---
I was initially thinking gnome for escape artist but was really torn about human for diplomacy.  I do plan on grinding out most of the reputations.  Some of them I'll be trying to grind earlier on in order to try to profit off of crafting so the time saved will be pretty nice.  The sword and mace skill is nice but not really something worth building a character around in my opinion.
---
How come posters on this sub are so aid's to using the search feature
---
There’s nothing wrong with remaking tons of characters, I did that in vanilla for the first 3-4 weeks. Eventually you will get annoyed of remaking and you will gravitate towards one of your characters. Fate will decide for you.
---
Well, this is a nice trend! Keep it going!
---
Play your warrior. Classic is about the journey. If you can only invest 2, 3, 6 hours per week into a journey then may those hours be legendary. I will level as a protection warrior, the levelling will be tough and gruesome and slow, but damn it's gonna be extremely enjoyable.
---
I agree that I also strongly expect 16 debuff limit at launch.
---
However, playing devil's advocate, they did initially announce 4 phases.
---
Willingess and ability to tank are vastly different from the class population. If you're willing to tank, you'll find dungeon groups easily and if you are willing to get a set of pre-BiS gear you'll get raid spots too.
---
Take me now
---
Nice what kind of jets
---
I pick what I'm going to level by making a simulation in smash bros. with 8 CPU miis playing a stock battle all named after each class. Then depending on what class I get i have another mii battle to determine the race my character will be. 
---
Then what really makes me stick to that character is the time and effort I invest into professions and gearing. If I have a level 20 who has no professions hardly any gear and was just quested as fast as possible to level 20 I'm not going to feel as attached to that character as a level 20 who has all of the best items I can get from VC and is maxed out on professions for that level.
---
It was absolutely the AP normalization, of what you listed. When the weapon speed normalization was applied in 1.10 2h arms raiding ceased being useful at all. I distinctly remember logging in and having all the warriors in my guild talking about the death of their raiding spec and how much they hated fury.
---
I liked Faerie Fire (feral) as a cat druid. It prevented rogues from re-stealthing, gave just that much more armor reduction, and was a debuff slot filler, so just one more thing in the way of a target scrubbing off a better damage-over-time spell.
---
Nah, it would be a personal or guild list that you could share. That’s all I’m saying.
---
If you use flat burst finishers and non damage-over-time poisons, Gouge and the improved version with talent points can allow a rogue to bandage and also stall for another cooldown.
---
im gonna go straight ahead and say iceblock, that shit is incredibly unfun to play against
---
To a sinner maybe.
---
This one right here, officers.
---
Gimme a hell yeah!
---
Looks like classic's back on the menu boys!
---
Yep. It's the simplest and most elegant solution:
---
Let the community police itself.
---
It worked during vanilla and it will work during Classic. Though I pray to everything that is good and holy that there won't be any realm transfers available for Classic. The only way for shitty people to learn their lesson is to force them to face the consequences for their actions. If a ninja looter can simply server transfer then it ruins the entire point.
---
As long as people are aware that there will be *real* consequences for their actions they will be far less likely to commit those acts in the first place.
---
Wow, that's probably the 1000th post this week bashing on minmaxing and telling people to enjoy the game so they can reap karma.
---
Essentially you're just being a hypocrite with this post. Telling people to play the way they want but then depicting people who want to rush as brainless.
---
Yeah, so no crit damage talent, but you can stack jotc for a bunch free spell damage. You get 10% from sanctity, but most other nuke specs get 20% or so from a curse and another 10 or 20 crit from talents. It is like 800 or so free damage in exchange for scaling worse. That's like t2 + whatever gear you have in exchange for not scaling well.
---
Ideally, not forever but about 3 years.
---
I think it's a great start.  Here are my suggestions for some future developments:
---
1) You have Elixir of Fortitude listed twice
---
2) Alphabetise everything (I find it helps me find things easier)
---
3) Split the materials list out by source.  ie for Alchemy you could have a section for Herbs, Elements, Enchanting, Fishing, Vials
---
4) I'm not sure how useful it would be but maybe have the values for the oils populate when you populate a potion that requires it. ie you want 5 FAPs it automatically says you also need 5 Blackmouth Oil
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Getting more complicated
---
5) Have a page where you can list your standard raid requirements and current inventory levels.  So if you want to go to a raid with 20 major mana potions and you currently have 12 it knows to only give you the requirements to create 8.
---
6) The same as above but for materials.  Say you actually needed 530 dreamfoil for all your potions, and have 173 in your inventory you would need to be obtain an additional 357 through farming or the auction house.
---
Extra for money makers
---
7) Have some way to put in what materials you currently have and have the spreadsheet optimise what combination of things would make you the most money (if selling on the auction house).  This one is a bit beyond my own Excel skills so I'm not sure how easy it would be...
---
I read all of your whining about griefers.
---
You just seem upset about having to team up with actual world interactions,  in order to have the quickest path to rank 13 honestly
---
Griefing happened back then... a lot lol. 
---
I was in a guild dedicated to it after I got decently geared in separate one. 
---
Horde or AC, as long as you know a priest on the opposing faction, no one is safe
---
You are a piece of shit.  
---
If you feel offended now, please keep in mind that this only my only persona.   
---
Acting like an asshole is still being an asshole.
---
They'll never admit that the imbalance is _really_ bad. Why? Because they plan on playing those classes or they already have all their metas pre planned out, and ANY changes by Blizzard mean the computed-to-death metas are now worthless.
---
in the name of cLasS fAnTaSy
---
Yes, I'll be posting them to this comment

Totally.  I actually played Elemental in BC and got gladiator.

But we were not nearly as good as we were in vanilla haha

This subreddit nowadays, based on  \[GingerBreadMan5's post\]( [https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avd2fb/pick\_pvp\_server\_for\_the\_full\_vanilla\_experience/](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avd2fb/pick_pvp_server_for_the_full_vanilla_experience/) )
---
Wow. So the biggest downside of a warrior is...they need a group to farm gold? So, they're an A+ in every other category, but this one. Interesting.
---
I'm aware.  
---
What I'm saying is that even if stoneform is all a dwarf priest had, I'd still take that over night elf.
---
This is so great thank you so much! I know the druid tree will be harder but I would love if you could do it as well
---
I've never played classic, started in legion and I'd like to see how different it is.
---
I heard it's good so i might play it more than retail.
---
Wasn't pre nerf cthun mathematically impossible?
---
Unless you don't plan to raid outside of pugs, which on pservers generally struggle to do more than MC/Ony, it shouldn't be more than the length of one phase
---
Hunter epic probably won't be available until phase 2 (it shouldn't, since the primary source of blue sinew is from azuregos).  BWL comes in phase 3.
---
So... you'll use it for one phase.
---
True, we don't know how long phases are going to be, but it doesn't really matter, since it'll only be best in slot for one phase.
---
Phase 1: Carapace Spine Crossbow
---
Phase 2: Rhok'delar
---
Phase 3, 4, 5: Ashje're Thul
---
Phase 6: Nerubian Slavemaker
---
Now, it's possible they'll put the quest in at phase 1 since the quiver isn't required to complete the quest (or put the sinew in on the blue dragonkin in winterspring), but even if it is, "From launch until BWL" is still a very, very short period of vanilla.
---
PVE server right? I would get that for PVE, I guess, but shadowmeld in pvp is incredible. The only strong argument for the dwarf priests is fear ward, and aesthetics.
---
Shadowmeld doesn't work in combat, so it won't help in a city with guards after you. The only benefit or NE over any other is effectively +1 level for stealth, and 1% more dodge chance.
---
Most pvpers go gnome for alliance rogues, some go dwarf. Most pvpers go orc or UD for horde rogues.
---
&gt; Character permanence is important.
---
Should be important. But only as long the Classic Team can hold the line vs whomever at Blizzard who thinks current retail is the best product they could make.
---
Because games aren't just made by devs nowadays, they are made by algorithms and other corporately enforced rules meant to keep player activity and longetivity as high as possible. Its all about One endgame: Make all the money. Not some of the money, not a reasonable profit, All The Money, more and more every year (which is obviously not sustainable, and the reason we are seeing somewhat of a crash atm). The only way to achieve this is to employ every malicious strategy you can mathematize and scheme out in order to moneytize the game via loot boxes, boosts, packs, whatever it could possibly be.  
---
Back in the day, when games weren't an online service first, game second, the way to make money was to deliver a good product - that was the only way to keep shelf life long and satisfy investors. Its the success of Blizzard bk in the day (remember how long starcraft diablo and warcraft were still in stores?). Nowadays, the playing field is just very different and the industry has been corporatized heavily - it is a huge industry after all, bigger than the movie/tv one.
---
As I said, it is common courtesy to ask or tell them your intentions when you join the group. Taking loot for two specs without saying anything is frowned upon, you can justify it and argue for it, but at the end of the day, you're at the mercy of other players, and they're not going to like it when you take the healer's gear and then the DPS's gear, that's just how it is. 
---
Just ask or tell the group.
---
BC pre-patch was 2.0 something. Came a full quarter of a year later iirc.
---
Its funner when you dont power through it.
---
Its like getting raped. If you just relax, its not all that bad.
---
Eyyyyy my joke returns in a future thread
---
Oof
---
I've been leaning towards rogue. And you just made me realize how horrible the first few levels will be.
---
Gnome rogue is BIS if you're trying to make people super mad at you.  
---
No race invokes the amount of rage that a gnome does.
---
It might not be as flashy graphics-wise, but it shows the same stuff + the demon spells and quests you get. [Link.](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=837)
---
The warriors deserve it, it takes 4 times longer to level and hunters have it easier in every way. Gold making, leveling, soloing content, can actually put up a fight in 1v1 pvp. Why can't the warriors have this one thing?
---
Not if you picked Thunder Bluff to race me from.  See, I can pick a long way away too.
---
Yup.
---
I remember when race changes go introduced and a well known Rogue on my server changed from Undead to Troll, and even though I didn't know him personally, I was like "man, that fucking sucks. He was the cool Undead Rogue, but now he's some other race because he paid some dollhairs."
---
Extend that to name changes and it's even worse. Changing anything about your character really ruins the community feel. I don't even want the barber shop (let the downvotes rain).
---
Personal experience ?
---
And it's easier to get raid gear as a hunter too boot! Like holy shit they have it all
---
1. I'll get that fixed
---
2. Is there an easy way to sort the whole column either in Google Docs or Openoffice Calc?
---
3. Considering this too. Again, is there an easy way to move stuff around without doing it one line at a time and cut-pasting?
---
4. That's a long-term plan.
---
5. The whole idea is that you put in how many you want to craft in the first vertical column and it then spits out how much you need to craft it. As it has no way of communicating with the game client (that is WAAAAY past my profiency level) it has to be done manually.
---
6. Again, as I have no access to your in-game inventory, you'll need to do that manually. If someone makes an addon they are free to use my document, even if all the info is available on databases like Wowhead.
---
7. Maybe in the future. I'm not really well versed in Excel-type programs so I'm learning as I go. Things like this is what I'd like assistance with, as maths is always hard and confusing for me, especially when you have as many things as this going on at the same time.
---
Why aren't you playing Tauren?
---
Why did you marry your son
---
&gt; (let the downvotes rain).
---
Not in this forum. Here we like that your character has an identity and a role in a community.
---
Your better off wanding or drain/tapping
---
Just as annoying as the daily ret/enh being useless class memes. 
---
The community is so divided
---
Yup, exactly.
---
PVP server. You think stoneform isn't a strong argument for PVP?
---
Crazy how some of us actually turned out like this guy
---
Should call it the Robert Baratheon
---
My first thought when seeing this: "Man, it'll be great to read the /r/classicwow tears when the private server actual armor values do not match the real game and melee dps isn't as ubiquitously good as previously thought."
---
i hate how good bloodvine is
---
Imagine thinking leveling time matters. You level for like 10 days /played max.
---
It's embarrassing when people bring that up like it matters.
---
Warriors are pvp beasts, where are you getting the idea that they aren't?
---
It's really unhealthy for the game that one class dominates all aspects of endgame play.
---
Back in vanilla we didn't know math.
---
Horde, reason? Barrens chat friend. Barrens chat. I'm gonna be telling chuck Norris jokes like it's 2004! Got a list memorised and everything.
---
But seriously iron forge is an amazing place to hang out and craps on ogg but Hord levelling experience has so much more character IMHO.
---
Viper sting was the long play though.
---
I only used it on pallies and druids.
---
Clothe wearers are so so squishy it's not worth it. Just dps them.
---
Any chance of getting a warlock one even if just having text for the skills instead of images
---
Pick the good one.
---
*You know the one.*
---
Man that is cool! I look forward to classic but I’m fearful I just won’t have the time to play!
---
It’s a huge deal. A top tier guild will require a couple hundred gold in consumables a week. Warriors are broken as fuck but not being able to farm is a huge huge pain
---
I believe they are literally talking in between the spells. If you stand close enough to melee and you auto attack your guy will swing their weapon in between the spells you're spamming.
---
Mathematically improbable. Impossible in practice. http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/printthread.php?tid=4495
---
Guilds will bring 2 hunters, only if they can't find exceptional hunters. If a guild comes across 5 exceptional hunters, they will recruit 5 exceptional hunters.
---
&gt; you definitely can't do that in xiv. distinctly remember starting by a cliff and not being able to jump off it
---
I played ffxi for a while and honestly one of the worst things about it, other than the awful, awful grind, was being stuck to the ground.  Not being able to jump seems like such a silly thing, but it completely takes me out of a game.
---
It is a fine line.
---
There is no need for any new systems of any kind of "loot trading", why are they even wasting time on these non issues.
---
The only reply ever needed on these matters was "No customer service will be available for moving any items of any kind in Classic WoW."
---
Always funny to help some sorry bastard with the Rhok'delar quest. Showing him how it's done by doing it in one try.
---
Yeah but you COULD trade them the gold on bfa to buy their own token and they give you the gold on classic. Obviously thos wouldn't be supported by blizzard, but I cant imagine it goes against the tos either
---
Hey thanks for posting. Why do most rogues prefer Gnome over Dwarf? Isn't Dwarf clearly superior?
---
yah fuck you asshole that down voting me, bitches be jealous
---
It’s a talent at level 40 so it’s free
---
Because leveling is maybe 5% of your total play time by the time most people will stop playing classic/progressing through tiers, Hunters hitting 60 in 7 days /played instead of 10 means they should be complete garbage in raids? Hunters aren't even a hybrid class so the stupid hybrid tax meme doesn't even apply.
---
You can't read, at all. Stop commenting.
---
having a job to take vacation from means you are a casual
---
Yes, that would be the point of releasing C'thun pre-nerf for a while. 👿
---
They definitely did something to AV before the end of vanilla that eliminated multi-day instances. I don't remember what it is, though
---
&gt; Warriors are pvp beasts, where are you getting the idea that they aren't?
---
a warrior with a pocket healer is a beast in pvp
---
a warrior 1 v 1 against a hunter is a dead man
---
For 2 and 3 it should work okay using the sort function in excel. I'm not sure how it would go in Google docs or open office. It's the sort if thing that is best done sooner than later so you don't come unstuck if it does mess with any formula.
---
For 5 and 6 I didn't mean for it to require you to link into the game itself. I'm not sure if that's even possible.  Rather the person completes 1 column that gives them the base levels of what they want on raid night. This could stay static as sort of a min consumable level. They then only have to update their current inventory levels prior to each raid rather than have to do the maths themselves (even if that part is easy). The same with materials lists. If you are farming you are unlikely to carry your current stock with you so it also helps as an additional reminder that you need another 300+ dreamfoil or whatever.
---
I know this sub hates reading the word nostalgia but a lot of people on this subreddit are pretty rose tinted towards Classic, at least when it comes to how it actually played. WoW was one of the most casual MMOs when it first launched in 2004, and it wasn't ever perfectly balanced. 
---
But you'll find hundreds of posts on this subreddit from people who say "Vanilla WoW will SAVE all of gaming and make MICRO-TRANSACTIONS go away forever and BLIZZARD will be good again!!!"
---
I don't think the community is that divided on ret and enhance tbh.
---
So what about the middle 80% of guilds? Still broken AF, but just need less gold? I guess making anything other than a warrior or priest or mage or rogue truly is pointless
---
But if you smite then to death you can't run them off a cliff with MC
---
Thanks bro this is great! Very informative
---
Sorry, meant the whole, "play what makes you happy" vs realists divide. Just used the ret memes as an example
---
Do what I did, get a wife and kids to look normal!
---
Shit landed clean on Warrior...fuck that!
---
true, but having to fight casuals at the beginning can slow you down
---
And now  you can't even get 3s for those things in retail
---
Mount training was cheap in vanilla. They switched the prices after to make the training the expensive part and basic mounts cheap.
---
Flip a coin. If you don't like the result then change it.
---
It’s called Vanilla!
---
You do realize that private servers typically have *higher* armor values to compensate for stuff like 1.12 talents and to make the bosses more challenging, right? Melee DPS will be equally effective in Classic if not more effective.
---
If you like to play alongside toxic neckbeards, join horde. If not, join the alliance.

Incorrectly set loot tables.

they (nihilium) cleared content all the way to sunwell without using voice chat lol, private server wanks cant run wailing caverns without everyone being in a discord channel
---
Yeah, it's a bit far fetched. It is, though, part of a trend of bringing back old games that had game design that people remember fondly. Current game design as driven by the market is at odds with the game design 30 year olds grew up with. But the 30 year olds have money, too, so it's nice they (we) are being given the option at least.

I still remember the screeching sound of the dialup modem connecting and having to get off the computer when my mom needed to use the phone, pages written in basic HTML with pixelated clipart graphics, the whole nine yards.
---
Edgemaster is 1h only.
---
Can’t forget warlocks and soul stones for another battle rez
---
Fury use deep wounds too because its low prio debuff. You are right about rend.
---
I think that's by design, though. Making it take the hunter's bandwidth to heal their pet ensures there are no invincible pet shenanigans, which would make hunters even more obnoxious in PvP.
---
or ret pallies (lol)

"Billy ninjaed we have screenshots as proof"

"Lol, look at this moron complaining about ninjas in /2"

I failed.

Then: Part of the beta testing for WoW. Played all the content of vanilla WoW. Failed college, was laid off from my job, gf moved back in with her parents and we broke it off. Lived on a sofa.
---
Now: Married to better woman with two kids and a third on the way. Home owner and salery paying job in development. Graduated with a bachelor's in software engineering. An cant wait to pass the torch to my oldest on some WoW Classic. Ofc going Holy Pally
---
Druids are the least played class, so when you do get in a raid you get gear thrown at you like crazy.
---
Unless the shareholders view lack of customer service on WoW Classic as an issue that needs addressing (and it can be proven that the invested resources will generate a hard return), most of the money will be reinvested in mobile games. I've been an Activision shareholder for a long time and all of the meetings the last few years have been about how profitable the mobile game market is. Everyone wants them to take resources off traditional games and focus on mobile. Or add more loot boxes.  They want people to get addicted and spend hundreds of dollars on micro transactions, not just $15 a month. From an investor perspective (just want to make money, not quality games), it's all that matters.
---
Yeah, who wants to be a hideous cow man when you could be a Night Elf Chad instead.
---
Theres a 10 hour version of this I need to repeat until max.
---
Lol, whatever guild gets you is lucky, that poopsock made me chuckle
---
It picked a Rogue for me.
---
It's official. I'm going to tell everyone I gank in wPvP that I'm sorry but the Thug Life chose me.
---
Dude ty. Saving this
---
I hate that druids are so bad in vanilla. It's honestly the class I WANT to play because it's so much fun solo and leveling and I love the flexibility. I play a druid currently in retail, but I can't bring myself to play a class that's going to put me at a disadvantage as far as finding a raid spot since I have a work schedule and a wife and kids that are already going to limit me.
---
Oh fuck, actually maybe you can. It's been so long, I didn't think you could see the ammo when you inspected someone in vanilla but maybe I'm remembering wrong.
---
I hope they do balance the classes during classic at some point. I'm not talking sweeping changes, but change prot pally talent from on crit to on block. Give elemental/oomkins better mana talents, etc. Leave gear the same, but just tweak so they are playable.
---
There's this one here as well.

8% of all horde players will choose Druid.
---
5% get invited to raids.
---
That’s gonna be a no for me dog
---
i couldn't get that into the art style or the controls (which, tbf, would probably be easier to manage now that im not clicking and keyboard turning) but that makes me really happy, i'll have to give it a shot again one day
---
i can't imagine not being able to jump that's just ridiculous
---
just as annoying as the daily "ret isnt that bad" memes
---
These vids are great. I have my own nostalgic memories of different zones, but most of the horde zones and dungeons specifically I don't have much connection with or knowledge of and they're just afterthoughts to me. After watching some of these lore videos to understand the backstory, these zones and dungeons have taken on a whole new meaning for me and I'm excited to explore the content once Classic comes out. 
---
We really do need more content like this to help new people understand how deep the lore goes and how cool this game really is under the surface.
---
Thanks for this.
---
I was talking about on pservers where drain soul would get knocked off and wouldn't stick because they made it a low priority debuff.
---
 Well it does if you change specs.
---
I just tried this with my old account and I got it back!
---
Level 60 Warrior which hasn't been touched since 2006. I'll upload some screenshots soon.
---
Fuck that, you don't need a hobby. What you just did is impressive, take pride in that.
---
The things wow ruined for me in mmo's
---
#1 healing
---
i fucking love healing in wow , with the right addons it really feels like you are playing some advanced as fuck whack a mole simulator. you not only have to keep everyone alive but see the mechanics and anticipate incomming damage.
---
there is also healing in av atqmding in the back of the pack watching you effort push the zerg forward by keeping everyone up.
---
ive never played am mmo with similar satisfying healing and ive tried most.
---
#2 targeting &amp; combat
---
ill use BDO here as the example, it seems popular for modern games to avoid tab targeting or how combat traditionally works. in bdo and a few others its basically key combinations for spells and you just target where you look.
---
thing is i like tab targeting and being able to stay targeted easily while moving and i dont want to cripple my hands by putting in a 3 button combination for every bloody fireball.
---
#3 the keep the buff up game
---
modern wow means every class in most cases has some buff they have to juggle. this was not tye case in the first 3 expansions of wow. plenty of classes had rather simple base rotations.
---
blizzard at some point decided a class is not "fun" without some buff or skill to keep up all the time. This annoys me because its every class and so transparent they are doing it to create the illusion that the class takes skill.
---
this was the main thing that also took classes and just modified them a bit too much past what i liked when i first played the class.
---
i played a lock vanilla you know what i enjoyed just spammind shadowbolt, in pvp though there was a lot more to do, and we also got to tank twin emps which was fun. bc actually spiced them up a lot and gave players options for how they wanted to play but i would not even have a clue how to play a lock in modern wow.
---
*leveling up to reach 60 for endgame raiding and dungeon* small brain 
---
*leveling up because you need to be a certain level to learn higher level professions* OMEGA BRAIN
---
assuming the retirement home even lets him use a computer past bedtime
---
Dope! i've been waiting for a warrior one
---
I’m pretty sure you’re doing the meme wrong
---
Some quests in vanilla were pretty vague, “somewhere in the east” type shit. And sometimes the one thing you needed to click on was incredibly annoying to find.
---
Pim sure one will be made
---
I'd like to point out the consumables/buffs on that video. PoV has 5 consumables. 3 Elixirs, 1 flask, and 1 wizard oil. Not double world buff + felwood flower, etc. People on pservers put way too much into the world buffs.
---
Casuals are far and away more toxic than those who know how to play the game
---
Great image thanks!
---
... I got druid.... I've played a druid since vanilla. I guess it was and is still meant to be
---
Warriors are garbage all the way to 60 and until they get raid weapons and gear. And it's not just leveling time, most people quit on the way to 60 because it's also much more difficult.
---
A whole lot of nothing and depression ever since wotlk hit
---
At one time it rained in Westfall. That was back in the day though.
---
Dwarves tho
---
Bro I bet you can I get from thunderbluff to westfall faster than you can get from teldrasil to westfall. And that's literally only relevant if someone goes tauren hunter and even if it is slower it's not by a significant amount, and definitely alot less then hordies thinking it's legit only available to allys
---
No it's fine, I enjoyed it. Shadowmeld is better in pvp if you don't already have stealth, 100% no doubt about it.
---
The middle tier of guilds will struggle to clear content. Especially if they are underconsumed. They will though with time.
---
It’s not pointless at all. It’s a game meant to be played for fun. Though if your goal is to be a top tier player, keep in mind certain classes are frankly much better than others.
---
Warriors require much more of a time commitment right when they are created to the second vanilla ends. Hunter is so easy it's a fucking joke. They can make over 100+ gold an hour and 1v1 any class. Their raid gear is extremely straight forward. Just wear the tier sets, no thought involved. It's just a braindead class, that's why it's ok when there dps is trash. But they are still useful unlike a ret because they at least have a purpose with a tranq shot or pull at specific times.
---
Yeah, my guild and most people in general werent that good. It was more like, hey I heard Fury is better, well it cant be that much better, im going to stick with Arms. It took a fairly long while for people to swap over to Fury I remember.
---
As a dwarf it's about the same time though because you need to get to teldrasil and then hearth back
---
20 assholes can't clear shit without coms so far, anymore?
---
Disagree entirely. Shadowmeld is more suited for other classes, doesn't work as well on a priest.
---
Fast forward to how people play today and it's more like 27 warriors 7 shamans 1 priest 1 druid 1 lock 2 mages 1 hunter
---
The reason you have to delete folders and such on pservers is because the pservers dont patch YOUR client, while the Blizzard one will.
---
So no, you wont have to delete any folders for Blizzard server
---
Escape artist. 0.5 second cast, removes all movement impairing and root effects, like frost nova and roots. Dwarf has stone skin that gives a very minor boost to armor, and bleed, disease, and poison immunity. Not a lot of classes do poison bleed or disease compared to slows and roots.
---
Lmao, of course that's how it will play out. Unless you steal something super rare just a few select people are going to blacklist you.
---
What was the size of the data set you analysed?
---
Can I get a tldr
---
Lol, it rolled Warrior. I was planning to run Warrior anyways. It is the almighty wheel!!!
---
I played both factions a ton before Cata so I have nostalgia for both.
---
I'll pick alliance simply because SW + IF &gt; Org + UC to me. The overall leveling experience isn't that different to me. Some horde zones are better and some ally are.
---
At the end of the day just pick for what you think has prettier cities and what you want your character to look like.
---
yeah cause going mage is gonna get you a spot....with the other 4389472389 mages on the server.
---
Isn’t there a swimming shortcut for Nelfs to get to Dun/Sw
---
It seems like it already is and was. For quite some time. Or they’re just basically rainman.
---
Respectfully disagree, my first character was a dwarf rogue and I always saw them as cold and calculating assassin archetype, a true villain or clever explorer.
---
It's hard to get out of 'INTREST YA IN A PINT' mindset, but imagine an Indiana Jones Brann type, or a soft spoken British thug on the other end of spectrum.
---
I don't have a life so it doesn't really matter what time of summer they drop it, I'm still taking 2 weeks off and no-lifing it.
---
I'll take July 16.
---
I get downvoted when I bring it up here because its a very different MMO than wow but GW2 is one of my favorite games ever. Its pretty much exclusively what I am playing while I wait for classic. Definitely worth a shot imo
---
Yes.
---
The sooner the better. I’m tired of rolling my faction, class and race 46 times a day and changing my mind by the hour
---
When the time comes we should make a forum post that keeps an active list of ninja looters.
---
amen
---
search elysium core repack
---
Been stuck between Warlock or Mage. First roll landed on Warlock. Fate has been decided.
---
If you just took the most recent 200 doesn't that massively skew the composition? If all the Molten Core raid compositions are naxx geared speed runs, what's the point?
---
Wouldn't it be more accurate to take the first kills of each raid, eg progression?
---
2004: 10 year old boy just starting a scary new puberty, living in the middle of nowhere with dial-up internet. Getting pretty good grades in grade 5 math. Leveled as arcane mage.
---
2019: 25 year old girl just starting an exciting new puberty, with 1.5 gigabit connection wrapping up my master's thesis in computer science. Gonna level arcane mage.
---
&gt;There are no trucks in World of Warcraft!
---
Man. Back when WoW was popular enough to get into a completely unrelated product's commercial. What a throwback.
---
Blasphemy
---
I think u mean to disagree since op want to prolong the release date
---
Dude said he'll do it if video gets 10k likes. After 1day it sits at 3k likes. Let's make him do it!
---
Probably because telling other people how to enjoy a massively diverse MMO is, in itself, a dumb thing to do lmao
---
Correct, I answered his title question.
---
I'm an elitist who loathes people writing 'cuz' when they should arguably just write out 'because' like an adult, but the sentiment behind the O.P. was appreciable enough that I didn't down-vote it and just left it as is.
---
You're welcome.
---
Exactly. I hope he at the very least helped you pay for it.
---
the \#NoChanges movement is fucking retarded and everyone involved should be put to death. 
---
Themepark MMOs survive because there is a constant stream of content. Unless they pull the smart move and make content 1.13 and beyond like OSRS, you're going to have empty servers a year into release. Nobody is going to want to replay the same stale content forever. You could make the argument like a shit-eating TipsOut fanboy "b-b-b-b-b-but private servers have healthy populations!!!". That's because the majority of the people who play on private servers are too poor and stupid to get a job to play an actual good subscription MMO like FFXIV. They definitely won't be shelling out the 15 bucks a month. 
---
Blizzard needs to think hard about this and ignore the retarded vocal minority screaming for essential a carbon copy of private servers which are already widely available.
---
edit: Looks like the ShitsOut fanboys are out in full force tonight downvoting and censoring the truth. Enjoy your empty servers.
---
Definitely well said
---
Would love this for all classes
---
Damn, it’s been a looooong time since I’ve seen this. There are a lot of jokes I get now that I didn’t when I was 14.
---
No offense to anyone, but I'm pretty sure an extremely small minority of people are going to take days off for the release. 
---
That being said, I would support this idea because its summer and I want to spend the winter months inside when it's cold not the warm ones.
---
People get preemptively counter-triggered at the thought of others getting triggered, but it's **all** triggered at the end of the day.
---
I would do it too! It wouldn't be at launch because I want to enjoy it a bit but probably within the year.
---
Thanks for all the comments guys appreciate it. Just saw this posted here. I don't really expect 10k likes since before this I never had any video over 2500, but apparently people really want me to waste my time. I would gladly accept the challenge though
---
Grats m8
---
Okay this is straight fire. Shout out season 1....take me back.
---
[This](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=23418) buff is given to all Paladins, and all you have to do is right-click it off. There is even an option to automatically remove it with addons like LazyPig. A complete joke compared to the Shaman one.
---
Then: 13, high school, played WoW with friends.
---
Now: 28, decent paying job where I set my own hours, 0 commitments, no gf, no mortgage. Will be playing with a couple of the same highschool friends.
---
My body is ready.
---
Cross Realm BG's were in 1.12. Hell, in the patch notes it's literally the first thing mentioned. I remember the days of waiting 30 minutes for a queue to pop and facing a preform. No thanks.
---
If you wanna see the same names and/or faces from your server, attack one of their capitol cities, I'm sure they'll show up.
---
No changes.
---
To be fair , after seeing the poll results on reddit there will be quite a lot more locks than mages in classic ( if the polls end up being accurate).
---
Lmao. You play retail eh?
---
Or they could half alliance heavy servers and half horde heavy servers in the same battlegroup. Problem solved and noone needs to reroll.
---
Yep, thats where i am.  Ive been tempted, but i just dont want to ruin the official game for me.
---
What classes can reliably tank the 5 man dungeons on Horde side?
---
Gemma Chan tho, mmmmm :)
---
Druid and Warrior
---
Can't see the mustache...but it's there.
---
Honestly can't wait to shadowmeld at the top of the elevators at thousand needles and MC people off them, can't come sooner
---
Can I just play this video game?
---
Pretty sure coil isn't removed by wotf
---
Hi there! I thought this would make a really awesome wallpaper, so I removed the NPC's nametag. [https://i.imgur.com/BN1DGDw.png](https://i.imgur.com/BN1DGDw.png) \- it's not the best but hope you like it!
---
Then- roughly 14 years old, in high school, played Rogue and Warrior. 
---
Now- 29, married with a house, planning on having a kid soon but I got a bit of time to get some WoW in before that happens.
---
TLDR don’t be a dick. Do be a good player
---
Right on. Cheers!
---
Whoopsies, I just looked down and it looks like someone else did it before me. Lol :P
---
    /cast Drain Soul(Rank 1) /run local a=GetBagName(4); if a=="Core Felcloth Bag" or a=="Felcloth Bag" or a=="Soul Pouch" or a=="Box of Souls" or a=="Small Soul Pouch" then PickupContainerItem(4,GetContainerNumSlots(4)) DeleteCursorItem() else end
---
That is the macro that gets posted most frequently for soul shard management.  Since soul shards automatically go into soul shard bags, you keep your shard bag in the leftmost bag slot, and if your bag is full of soul shards when you cast drain soul with that macro, it will delete the last shard in your bag so they never end up overflowing into your other bags.  You can change to higher ranks, but you're not really using drain soul for damage, and because the extra damage is spread out over a 15 second cast, the higher mana cost isn't usually worth it.
---
B/c healing coefficient from long cast times
---
I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong, you're probably only outdpsing mages/war/rogues on very very few fights or you're just raiding with subpar players.
---
Here's most than enough parses to show you what I mean:
---
[https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx). 
---
Make sure you set the realm list to North... or Light...as those 2 have the most accurate parses, I set it to AQ 40 btw but feel free to browse through any /all raids or specific boss fights to see the how every class does on every encounter ( North... hasn't reached naxx yet so you won't find parses for that raid at this time ).
---
Rerolling is never a realistic solution. But battlegroups are not as fun as playing against people on the same server.
---
There's already a video discussing this topic
---
"Play the game the way I want to play it or you are dumb!!!"
---
Nice.
---
but for some reason they had to change the animations with no option for the original
---
&gt;the most meme spell in Vanilla WoW.
---
but that's not Sentry Totem
---
Have you seen the trends lately? It's hilarious.
---
Some guy makes a post suggesting how to play, then a swarm rebuts with "don't tell me
---
how to play, grrr." I'm just seeing it before it happens at this point.
---
Idk how people feel so threatened by these posts as if we might ever lose our privilege to tryhard and min/max lol. Oh, the redundancy.
---
What is the difference between an ok hunter and an exceptional one? I used to play back when I was a kid and I sucked bad, but I’m wondering what I can do differently now that I actually have a fully developed brain
---
This might be the only meme I've ever laughed at
---
At 16th level, I wouldn't be out at Teldrasil still.  Your argument is just wrong.  I can get to there from Stormwind faster than you can from Org.
---
Personally I have talked to most of the people I felt strong enough to keep in touch with over the years and they're not really going to play for various reasons. I hopped around different servers too many times to really get to know a larger group of people for too long. I'm excited to meet new people and build new relationships.
---
Of course it is, but that doesn't change the fact that the reaction parade that follows each post is silly and redundant.
---
I agree, rerolling ins't an answer.
---
For me, no fun is waiting 30 minutes to face the same people over and over.
---
WTB one for warlock/warlock demons with accurate spell skips
---
Don't know if this counts, but i hated how combo points were attached to the target back in the day. I can't remember which expac it was, but I was ecstatic when they finally made the change to have them generate on the player instead. Not gonna lie, it's going to be tough to switch back for me.
---
I'll never forgive blizzard for how they ruined female human casting animations
---
Ha! Same.
---
Thanks, and can Shaman heal even if they're not restro specc?
---
Warlocks aren't as good as hunters at soloing, but they're close. Great mana efficiency soloing and have a voidwalker to tank.
---
But that assumes you can get that weapon in BWL.
---
Each boss drops like two or three items for 40 people, there is gonna be other hunters in the raid that all want it.
---
Scarlet monastery GY has grave moss and kingsblood, library and cathedral have up to liferoot and 1-2 herbs each.
---
This exactly, everything else won’t be used in general leveling. Though you would be a slight disadvantage in PvP with some skills missing ranks. But than again, everyone should be skimping on skills while leveling.
---
An increased chance to deal double damage is undeniably stronger then killing a monster with the same amount of swings. Pretty simple stuff.
---
 It's like I told you "going out and talking to women increases your chances of getting laid". It's a bloody fact.
---
Boaratheon rather.
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
There's several players who have done 1-60 sub 80 hours, but most of them are hunters.
---
Push it to the last day of summer, or release it the first day: I'm there either way.
---
Was Alliance all throughout Vanilla, played mostly on my gnome rogue.
---
Got a group of friends playing and we've decided to go Horde. Still deciding races but the Horde just feels so... right for Classic.
---
You accidentally switched cow man and night elf in your sentence
---
sentry totem more meme than firestone ?
---
My first 60 was a Tauren Shammy, had no idea what I was doing. I rerolled an undead warlock and mained locks through today. I am now seriously considering rolling a troll mage as my first character this time around. My buddy mained one forever and he seemed to really like it, so I'm going to try one out.
---
Oh. okay.
---
Dude... what? Yo unless you can get a mage to Port you, you will still need to run though wetlands/loch/dun morogh if you want to get to sw. There's no boat to sw or anything in vanilla, you HAVE to go through wetlands. So yeah I don't get how you can say "I'll just be in sw at 16" without making the wetlands death run or deathwarping above dun morogh
---
Warrior will be the better DPS and tank but you should play the class you want to play. Little story about offspec classes, I was a tank in a hardcore progression guild and after we killed C'Thun I quit from burnout. Back then Blizzard would release new servers every so often so I joined one and rolled a Druid. When I got to 60 I found a guild and we had a very non-traditional raiding group constantly, tons of hunters, multiple feral druids, lots of resto druids, shadow priests, think we had a moonkin, and we raided. It wasn't optimal but we cleared MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20, and got a few AQ40/Naxx kills before the guild called it quits because of too many real life obligations. It was a lot of fun raiding with a bunch of random classes/specs you wouldn't normally see but it worked because everyone knew what they were doing encounter wise and just wanted to play. 
---
When I went back to my other guild to help them on Four Horsemen I saw how many people I thought were great players were just playing better classes and kinda sucked. At the end of the day I'll take a less ideal class into the raid if they're a good player with good attendance. It's a game so play what you think will make you happiest.
---
Yes, but you'll want to make sure you bring a lot of water and down rank spells.
---
Mage, it's like the best class in WoW. Great CC with Poly and frost nova, you can blink away from problems, rank 1 frost bolt is OP, and your DPS is fantastic.
---
As long as they have a healing set (read: gear with intellect so they have a decent mana pool and don't go oom every fight/halfway into every boss fight).
---
This guy.... doesn’t fucks
---
Don't need professions for money as a warlock. You can go enchanting/engineering and farm Mara and DM for money disenchanting all the blues. I believe 40g/hr is easily obtainable. 
---
You will need Tailoring when ZG comes out, but you will unlearn it as soon as you craft Bloodvine.
---
I wont be playing an orc, was thinking undead who also has good pvp racial.  I wouldn't feel too bad about a minor difference, but 7% DPS is massive enough that I'd rather just play a different class than gimp myself that much.
---
I have had sex in Goldshire at least 6 times with at least 3 different people, and I only paid for it twice. So you could say I'm...experienced.
---
i've heard some really good things about it! i'll be sure to give it a shot :D
---
Not to be rude at all, but do your parents ever nag you at all about still living there? Are you actively job searching or just mooching?
---
I feel like I'd get kicked out if I was no life-ing WoW at that age without contributing financially
---
Orc, the Stun resist is great and your felhunter is able to devour fear off of you.
---
How friendly will this game be to completely new players? It seems like a lot of this sub is extremely experienced in current WoW and will get frustrated and annoyed at inexperienced noobs. I'm from an old school runescape background and like the vanilla style of play so I think WoW classic will be great I'm just worried it won't be new player friendly!
---
I was gonna say Eyes of the Beast
---
I started playing at the launch of Cata but Vanilla was hyped by my friends who played back then. I’ve been left feeling demotivated because of all the elitists that hate on any new comers. It sucks.
---
Using viper sting on a paladin will hurt your mana more than his.
---
Big mortal strike crits with that animation felt SO good! I miss it so very much.
---
Luckily it's coming back!
---
[If you insist](https://i.imgur.com/34ujlS7.png)
---
I want a July release date since I'll have a week of no kids/wife at the end of July and it'd be nice if it was out by then.
---
Do you have no idea that there's a tram from SW to IF?
---
You didn't even read the post.
---
No it's not.
---
Sorry for stealing your computer but I needed it for classic.
---
I get down-voted because I don't want to be **cheated** out of loot that drops?  Totally makes sense.
---
I could also be remembering wrong too. I played a hunter but didn’t go around inspecting others too much
---
How is a Wind Serpent at AoE tanking?
---
That because capes sometimes have clipping issues.
---
Also..[NO CAPES!!](https://m.imgur.com/r/smashbros/9Ybgz)

First time seeing this. Oh my! This man is a legend!

This is the best screen shot I have ever seen! That is seriously dope!

Why would they wonder that? They would know it’s because it’s impossible lol.
---
Honest question: Have you ever played World of Warcraft?
---
the first vid was really entertaining, prefer that one over this one :) Anyways. The fact that you took time to reshoot this is awesome! Content for everyone

but what if stressing over things and min/maxing is me enjoying the game?
---
Yo you're just trolling right? Do you get the fact that the only boat connecting darkshore/teldrasil to eastern kingdoms drops you off in wetlands at menethil harbor? And that from there you have to run through wetlands, through loch modan, and through dun morogh to get to ironforge to then ride the tram to stormwind. There is no other way to get to eastern kingdoms besides running to the barrens and getting on the ship in ratchet. You're not gonna just magically appear in westfall when you ding 15

Just play druid
---
I saw the sheep and lost it. I was SO EXCITED when I got that back in the day.
---
My cowwifes milk is way more nutritious though. 
---
All about that shoulder game
---
I miss all the old animations. Human male jumping up for the mortal strike is iconic
---
Its amazing for anyone who can have it, and doesn't have better. Literally the only reason not to be a nelf priest is fear ward, or human spirit for PVE.
---
Is this just all the skills or the ones you should only buy to level and save money?
---
The early 2000s are, like, the early version of modern internet. But that's a little different from just the early internet.
---
Nah, Allakhazam was the shit. Thottbot just had a better name.
---
Need more gold
---
These are so awesome, thank you for making them. Are you planning to do Warlock? I think a lot of people will reference these.
---
Dwarf rogue is an iconic fantasy race and class.

---
As a cat, why would I spend energy to increase my Attack power a few points for a few seconds when I can just use abilities that kill my target fast?
---
Never use it.
---
For you. Some people don't raid at all!
---
I’m sorry but if you never used gouge you didn’t play very well
---
Seriously play how/what you want. True elitists are very few. And you can always ignore.
---
Take that back. Troll women are the sexiest models in the game.
---
I used to call a 13 year old guild mate back in the day "Thottbot" on Ventrillo. Today, he's in med school and i still call him Thottbot on Facebook. (Happy Birthday, Thottbot!) :-)
---
A lot of that has to do with Hunters and Warriors (and Rogues) sharing a lot of the same loot. If you're gearing up raiders for the long term, why give a best in slot leather piece to a Hunter when the Warrior will do more with it?
---
The classes themselves are fairly balanced. Hunters do less damage but they also take less damage because they're ranged. You can get away with less healers if your group is ranged heavy.
---
Reddit *is* the game.
---
There's a good 30/0/21 hybrid spec that allows you to PvP very well, as well as still heal alright for PvE situations.
---
This sub represents a fraction of the player base. Most of the serious folk in here will be level 60 before you're level 15, so don't be intimidated by them! There will be plenty of people taking their time and willing to help new players like yourself.
---
Keep the questgivers at Tarren Mill intact and I say let's do it.
---
I will not kill you if you're fishing because fishing is torture enough.
---
The first time leveling to max in GW2 is very fun/satisfying, not much after that I felt.
---
Yes they do - and trust me, I am not happy where I’m at in life currently, at all, in-fact I feel terrible. I used to have all those things which I stated that I don’t have now, job, in school,  gf, a decent life... I made some stupid mistakes about 2 years ago and have ended up where I am now. 
---
However I am taking the initiative now and moving back to my home town in May. I will be staying with a friend but I plan to get on track with a job and my own place. There may not be that much time for classic after all, but I definitely still do plan to play when I can!
---
and stoneform.
---
Like many have said, most folks on this subreddit are sweaty try hard apes ;)
---
There will be lots of casual folks (the majority) so not to worry. If you find yourself really liking the game and wanting to “git gud”, look up some YouTube videos and class guides etc. There are so many resources now you’ll have lots of help.
---
Private servers or in vanilla? Either way, it'd be unlikely for even an experienced normal player to get anywhere near that.
---
That is fucked up.
---
Seriously fucked up. Hope that saddist has an aneurysm because that is fucked.
---
I think that divide only really appears when somebody explicitly asks for advice on the subject. In which case I think it is 100% justified to inform them that yes, ret will bottom the DPS charts.
---
Saying "ret is bad" and "play what you want" are not mutually exclusive. I 100% believe both.
---
Hell yeah, brother. Cheers from my bat!
---
and remembering that the act of talking to people and making friends and all that was legitimately a much larger part of the game back in 2004. it was 2004, after all. we didn't have super loopy facebook video skype discord chats n crap
---
and we didn't have guild finder
---
and guilds took more effort to make
---
and the greater amount of effort required to complete \*anything\* made the completion of those things even more rewarding, and THAT is something that can be very difficult to 'revert the mind' to
---
especially as Blizzard's completely predictable expansion progression formula leads to better rewards more often, more ways to get them, and less NEED to group up with others to get better rewards
---
prepare for this mentally
---
&gt;I guess making anything other than a warrior or priest or mage or rogue truly is pointless 
---
If your objective it to be successful in a raiding environment... yea, kinda. Welcome to vanilla lol
---
These are people who do it over and over again on private servers for records. Granted, many of them do it with less competition. You would need to break away from the pack very early to get these numbers when classic launches.
---
mmph sexy as fuck, thank you so much!
---
Hardest part of the raid was having enough geared tanks. Change my mind
---
Build more burrows.
---
I feel like I'm the only one who doesnt care about those boring things
---
&gt; Yep, you can out range Marksman Hunters who have 41 yard talented Aimed Shots.
---
That's not how that works. It's not Aimed Shot that gets 41 yards. It's **every single ranged attack**, including autoshots, arcane shot, viper sting, etc. The exception would be Scatter Shot, as its max range is 15 yards and goes to 21 yards with 3/3 Eagle Eye.
---
Oh and fire mages also get 41 yard Fireballs/Pyroblast, and they do way more damage than smite priests.
---
Think it's 3 years til we get The Burning Classic?
---
You can play a bad class all day, I don't care. Long as you're having a good time.
---
Doesn't empirically make it less bad. And doesn't mean your bad at it.
---
SL Lock &gt; all in 1v1
---
It was great. Just throw you in a world and let you figure things out on your own.
---
I understand all the story narratives that they do now, especially at the start of every expansion, but quite frankly...I don't care about that stuff. I prefer to invent my own stories. I just want to get to the action. I've done the opening questlines for BfA a few times and it's a half hour of me saying, "Just let me kill things!"
---
They hold you by the hand so much these days, it's embarrassing. I don't need a tour of Boralus. I'd rather discover the place on my own.
---
&gt; Aslong as its not done inside instances 
---
That's where it's the best, honestly. Nothing should change about it, it's a live service people offer late server and a great way to help friends and randoms throughout. Very in-line with old Blizzard philosophy à la Diablo 2 boosts.
---
Hiding in plain sight like a pro, I like it.
---
It's nothing like that. At all.
---
You'll be fine. Vanilla WoW was way more inclusive than it may appear because of the demand to fill 40 whole raid slots. If you can learn your class and how to play well you'll be welcomed more than you are turned away. If people are jerks you wouldn't want to play with them anyways.
---
There are only 2 reasons I worry about levelling guides and getting to 60 fast.
---
1) Part of the reason I quit a private server is because I didnt use any guides or addons to help me level. After getting to level 31 in Arathi Highlands, I ran out of quests, had no idea where to go, no idea where any good places to grind are, and no idea on what to do with my character.
---
2) If unarmored mounts are added for phase 1, I want to get one of those bad boys for myself and getting to level 60 seems like it can only help with getting one ASAP before they're made unavailable. If there is a good way to get 800-1000 gold before even reaching level 60, sign me up.
---
I will be judge, jury and *executioner*
---
Came here to day similar, love it.
---
You're assuming that more than 50% of people who make a character are going to raid. In actual Vanilla, it wasn't even close to that. Something like 1% of  players actually saw Naxx.
---
Not only are Druids rare, but they tend to want pieces that other classes don't want. Feral scales extremely well with raw stats (stamina / strength /agility / armor) so their best pieces are "meh" for Rogues and Warriors. Resto can pretty much ignore every stat except bonus healing and just downrank for mana efficiency.
---
Then: 14 years old, just moved to Australia with my family and barely spoke any English. Had a tough time finding friends/fitting in and I had a very hard time keeping up in school due to the language barrier. Ended up failing grade 12 as a result.
---
Now: Moved back home to Sweden in 2012. Got married 3 years ago. Recently quit my job as a laboratory assistant to go back to school and get my grades up so I can go to University next year.
---
There is a raid you're forced to do at the end of your main storyline quest that is literally 90% cutscenes. I couldn't believe my eyes. Lost a lot of interest in the game after that.
---
&gt; It's every single ranged attack, 
---
True, all except autoshot.
---
You're not understanding how much of an advantage that one extra yard of 42 yards vs 41 yards allows you to outrange hunters, I know this because I picked out hunters on purpose due to their risk to me. The moment I see an arrow flying my way I move back behind the line and force him to pick a new target, then I edge forward only just slightly and smite the hunter. I wish I still had my screenshots, but on my server I had 40-80+ kills every single AV, and I think the most I ever died in a game was 3 times. Most of the time 0. Nobody on either side ever got close to my kill/death ratios.
---
Terrible attempt. 
---
Try again soon!
---
No, you can not. You would get to Revered max.
---
I rolled Druid 3x in a row... then priest. So definitely rolling hunter.
---
Zug Zug
---
Lol
---
Im acting on instinct.
---
I wander alone.
---
Unleash the beast!
---
Mangy cur!
---
Right. And if meet them in PvP, i'll crush them. If I meet them in dungeons or grinding, I'll kill mobs faster. 
---
There is literally nothing a Raider doesn't do better in Vanilla wow.
---
&gt; True, all except autoshot.
---
Yes, including autoshot. I'm guessing you didn't play a hunter back then. The extra 1 yard doesn't give you an advantage as big as you think, especially if you're sitting in max range and all the hunter has to do is back off instead of standing still.
---
I don't find it surprising that you would get a lot of kills and very little deaths if all you did was sit in the back, pick people off and back out at the slightest bit of damage taken. Especially in 2006 where most people would just sit there or backpedal when they suddenly realize they're at 20% hp.
---
soul link
---
Then: Started playing in early 2006. Played a dwarf hunter. 15 year old freshman in high school. WoW turned into my therapy after my parents divorced. Spent all my free time playing. Made some friends and raided ZG.
---
Now: 27 year old managing jobs for a general contractor. Live on my own. My girlfriend just moved out of state for a job. If she ends up liking it I’ll find a job and move down there but for now I have some decent free time outside of work. Planning on playing horde this go around. Can’t decide between a troll priest or an orc warrior/shaman. Looking forward to raiding MC and BWL for the first time!
---
It's been a while since I leveled a mage, but are frost resistant mobs so uncommon that not leveling fireball is viable? I sort of recall water elementals we're very resistant to frost?
---
And it'll be easier to get rhok'delar?
---
Aside from the fact that you need to get *three* raid drops (or two and a rare dragonkin drop), it's not exactly an easy quest to complete.
---
If you look at pserver metrics (which are the most reasonable metrics we have to go on) hunters will be very underrepresented on raids.
---
Came here to upvote the post and every comment.
---
&lt;3
---
Yea it is, but entirely for pvp of course. You can crit real hard with bis gear, up to 4k AS, 3.5k fire trap and so on. There was a topic on it in old 2004 wow forum but I can't find it now
---
Rested experience, take me home.
---
Yeah, like when people say they wish they could play a blood elf, I just say a troll female. They're the closest thing in Classic to a "pretty race" on the Horde.
---
Right there with you dude, female orcs look the best in their armor out of all the race/sex combos.  If you have to go alliance then I would suggest Dwarves, they are the coolest and most laid back, "bro" race they have.
---
Give you have enough rage, you combine Sunder Armor with Heroic Strike during Revenge and Shield Slam CD. It's not useless and it is very much used, don't spread misinformation because you misunderstood something you heard or read in some top end guide.
---
Sucks it isnt like vanilla.
---
What do you mean by viable? Leveling? Yeah! PvPing? Absolutely! Raiding? Maybe.. we're talking 40 people here, 10 of which really don't matter when it comes to the easy ones like MC. So, possibly, if your raid leaders cool with it. But raids that are undergeared and need everyone at 100%, both with spec and consumables, you might have issues. I'd say most would be cool letting you try it out though.
---
No, this is new Blizz, minimize the amount of money spent on a game by reducing customer service.
---
they're pretty much on par with mages- if your raid runs a shadow priest- but they are less popular to play.
---
The real badasses never played vanilla; they joined in BC because they were holed up in their basements playing Dark Age of Camelot for the first two years.
---
Ahab was added with his dog Kyle and a quest to fulfill the wish of a dying child and I think it would be heartwarming to see him in Classic WoW.
---
Maybe not with the signature quest to catch Kyle since that is a gameplay change and rewards experience but to just add Ahab and Kyle wouldn't change anything at all and would be just a sweet thing to do.
---
Four day weekend on the weekend after release, that’s my plan anyways
---
We were in Naxx and the boss who goes to the window died up there so we couldn't loot, a GM moved it for us.
---
That kind of blow in PVP too tbh.
---
The sex robot panel should say thotbot
---
I’m sure they will release a version of the addon for Classic, people have always played the AH and there definitely will be demand considering how much harder it is to make decent gold in vanilla.
---
Wouldn't even be a big deal to add him with experience. It's not like everyone who does that quest is now going to reach 60 five days early.
---
look again and you might notice something even more interesting- ally raids tend to have (almost, on average) one more druid, the same number of priests, and as many paladins as horde bring shamans. 
---
Ally raids tend towards 13 healers and horde raids tend towards 12.
---
That’s the easiest choice to make. I roll horde because alliance is just a bunch of gay snowflakes, sipping on tea with their pinkies out in ironforge.
---
An exceptional hunter is willing to buy flasks for every raid, stay up after the raid to fish up nightfin for nightfin soup, and is willing to chain chug mana potions.  Oh, and still be willing to be dead last compared to other dps classes.
---
Honestly, this is nice and I’m cool with it. Also, what about a new npc in .Org and SW called Nost.... (pserver) name
---
I'm highly wary of adding gameplay changes since a lot of people want classic how classic was even this is pushing the envelope.
---
I never got why people even bothered with the quest, eventually I did the quiver part because that is the only part that matters, the xbow from AV is just better.
---
No one says 'it's great'.
---
Everything is fine for leveling and dungeons.  It's good in duels, but not in organized PVP.  Enhance is generally not used in raids; the only exception would be to use a totem-twisting Enhance shaman in place of a Nightfall hunter, but even that loses viability as the game moves on to AQ and Nax, since your geared hunters are generally a bit sad about there being only 1-2 raid slots available to them later in progression, and you might as well have one of them swinging Nightfall.
---
I mean, yeah. No surprise there.
---
Elves are just devolved trolls, after all.
---
Closest thing? They're totally hot.
---
Yes. I have played some retail and on several pservers. Did I play vanilla in 2004-2006 when it was around? No.
---
Implying that there wont be toxic people that judge someone based off their faction on the Alliance as well
---
Some people really love rolling the dice with every (potential) hit. You could say enhancement shamans were the original loot boxes....lol.
---
As a hunter, I got horde first ashjrethul on my server, put on my full set of twill gear and still globaled non raiders in BGs.
---
There's plenty of people that don't enjoy leveing but love the endgame.
---
This is the dumbest shit I’ve come across on this sub. Congratulations. It smacks of arrogance harder than Chris Brown on Rihanna. Sit down dork and play the fucking game.
---
2006: 18 years old, just finished high school. Spent my summer playing WoW instead of finding work before moving into tertiary studies (this really pissed my mum off)
---
2019: Working full time, married with 3 year old twins and a mortgage. Value what minimal gaming time I get and damn well sure I'll sink as many hours as I can into classic to relive the past.
---
Which one will you hit with? A freight train or a wet noodle?
---
Yes they will, naxx made sure of that.
---
they're not bad, they're the least popular class and having 2-3 per raid reflects their low population in general. 
---
One thing many players seem not to understand about druids is that their role in a raid is different on ally vs horde. On ally, they are the most efficient raid healer. On horde, they are the most efficient tank healer. Innervate and bres have obvious utility. 
---
Given how many more people level priests to 60 than druids, having 5-6 priest vs 2-3 druids is not surprising. If anything, having 5+ shamans per raid shows how valuable they are, as they are about in-between druid and priest in overall popularity, you'd expect to have 3-4 per raid based on how many level 60 shaman there are. Hunters are vastly underrepresented in raiding, although on private servers this is likely due to hunter farming alts that were never intended to set foot in a raid to begin with. Rogues are slightly underrepresented.
---
I’m going to say something controversial, but here it goes: this time around it’s not going to be the same for any of us. The wonder, amazement, and unknown isn’t there for us. We know where to level the fastest, what weapons are the strongest,  how to fight every raid boss etc. it’s just not going to be the same and that luster that never comes back may force some of us to inevitably quit the game shortly after release. However, for the veterans and noobs that it does bring in, great! It’ll show Blizzard and the rest of the MMORPG genre that what they are making currently is completely wrong. We don’t want RPGs with random players mixed in, but rather amazing communities that appear from the difficulty of the game and QoL being awful.
---
Hopefully this re-release will give closer to those who realize they have moved on from Classic, and an awakening to the rest of the genre’s developers....”we know what we want, and we’re tired of listening to you tell us what we want.”
---
Pretty sure it was ban-able offense in Vanilla days.  Usually leads to Devilsaur mafia like crap if not.
---
A change i wouldnt mind
---
Have hunters actually scale with gear...
---
I was gunna say what everyone already said but everyone else already said it so I won't say it. I agree with everyone else!
---
I'd rather have a bug-free well tuned product on Christmas than a bug-filled piece of junk tomorrow. 
---
... Although playing Classic tomorrow would be a god-send.
---
Then: 14 years old, super single, playing games every evening with all of my friends, having the time of my life. Not a single obligation.
---
Now: Graduating Med School in June after 5,5 years of studies. Working every other weekend to pay the bills and to have money to survive, running two clinical studies and planning two more, feels like lots of obligation and I'm tired all the time. I'll graduate on the 7th of June. Afterwards I'll spend 5-6 weeks doing clinical research but after that I'm on vacation until the 26th of August when I'm starting at my new job. I hope Classic will release early this summer..
---
I've seriously considered it, but like I said, I don't want to add another thing that's gonna make it harder for me to find a raid spot when I know that other things outside my control are already going to make it hard to find a guild willing to work with me. 
---
I work shift work, so no matter what day of the week raids are, I miss at least one week a month when I'm on night shift. I also have a family so there will be random times I can't play when something comes up with them. That's 2 strikes right there, I'm not about to add playing one of the least wanted classes on top of that.
---
I remember doing this quest when it was a real thing and I didn’t mind it at all.
---
I had no idea it was some kid with cancer
---
Rarely ever wiped on Nef, but doggie with 2 heads have caused us some trouble. We somehow always get 2 worst debuffs.
---
Whoa, an actual OC discussion?? I love it 
---
Then: 14, freshman in high school, playing WoW constantly with a few of my RL friends. Got 60 on my hunter and raided MC a few nights a week. Ended up sleeping through 1st period math class so often that I failed and had to retake it during the summer. Still worth it. 
---
Now: 26, post-college, bike messenger in a big city, got some free time on my hands. Ready to balance that free time with productivity and some good ol’ classic WoW. Gonna play less than I used to but planning on spending that time wisely. Maybe some more informed gameplay and less trolling in barrens chat for months straight.
---
Eyes of the Beast at least has *some* use with scouting or... trolling lowbies. I cannot think of a single use for the Firestone.
---
on pserver, hunter population is heavily inflated with farming alts that were never intended to step foot in a raid
---
Private server newfags will ruin classic. They should stay on their private servers.
---
*female dwarf
---
You can always choose the rpg path. Think about what role you wanna fulfill in the world, create a backstory for your character. Do you want to be an orc that's finally free from the Legion and needs to find his place in the new Horde? Or a night elf that wants to venture away from Teldrassil and join the ranks of the noble Alliance? I believe that's a nice way to choose race. The class might come naturally, if you let that imagination move freely.
---
Mate while i think you’re right to the level of competence a hunter will have, this guy is literally talking about 2004-2006 players who have no skill whatsoever. Those people still exist today on live. Quit gate keeping his fun lol
---
With them giving updates every week or so over the  past month I think we'll be hearing something soon :) HYPEE
---
Yeah what’s he up to these days?
---
And to add to it, the true elitists will be hiding away in their guilds running their own premade dungeon/raid groups. You probably won't even interact with them all that much... well until they get their alts up and have to pug off-raid times.
---
Thought you might enjoy reading this:

---
Not sure about the 3 years thing, but...  
---
As long as Classic is a success I almost guarantee we get Classic TBC or new Vanilla Classic content.
---
It’s not hard at all. You pick Horde. Every time. Easy.
---
Hitting something for 10 damage 100 times with a 10% crit chance would do 1,100 damage.
---
Hitting something for 11 damage 100 times with a 5% crit chance would do 1,155.
---
Your reasoning wasn't entirely sound. Increasing attack power versus critical chance is a balance. 1% crit chance is not as good as a 1% attack power increase. There are so many variables like bleed damage, threat generation, etc that matter. Yes agility gives you armor, but landing a critical strike is not always better than your normal attacks doing more. Critting twice as often isn't as good if your hits are doing significantly less damage
---
&gt;Why is picking a faction so damn hard?
---
Because WoW is an excellent game with several excellent options that leave you with almost too many options. I'm really glad some of my guildmates want to play Paladin, otherwise I'd probably be in the same dilemma.
---
Roughly at most, yeah. If you aren’t doing it all in one sitting then you could probably make sure you log out in Inns as much as possible to do it all in less boar kills.
---
Just play retail then. It's all about the endgame grind
---
Not me (I wish!) but it’s a really good read and got me even more hyped for classic.
---
When someone makes the priest one I’m making it my desktop background lol
---
That pic is 95% of people going to be playing classic. Old beat up nerds who can't let go of the past and need to relive it.
---
Put 4 locks in a group with shaman and drop tranq totem. Bam they can now do 80% more dps due to all of them having 20% less threat. Plus watever the shaman does if they decide to dps
---
You see... I want blizzard to do it without telling anyone.😈
---
I would assume so, yeah. I remember seeing SP rogues in TBC doing Karazhan level DPS in green cloth crafted gear just with weapon swapping and maintaining certain poisons on the target.
---
I haven't raided on a private server, my opinion of druids comes from my own memory (granted it was nearly 15 years ago), talking to others who also played in vanilla, and things I've read. The consensus is pretty much unanimous that druids are the worst option and more than 2-3 in a raid for buffs, innervates and bres is bad. Granted in my personal recollection, I can't ever remember turning down a druid for simply being a druid, but I also don't remember ever looking for an extra druid or taking one over a priest or shaman instead. 
---
While I have confidence in myself learning and doing well on whatever class I decide to play and feel that I'm at least an above average player, I also don't have the ability to put in the time I used to when I originally played and due to my work schedule I will not be able to make raids at least one week a month. It's gonna hurt my chances of getting a regular raid spot, so I'd rather play a class in higher demand to offset that some.
---
Warlocks do have burst. A night fall proc and shadow burn is 2k damage with decent gear. 
---
Also their survivability is insanely high with either siphon and drain or soul link or VE sac with health stones and pots and root tubers. 
---
Then their pets are Baroquen. Fell hunter counterspells and has dispel magic. Succy is instan cc. Vw is a massive shield and you can fel don our a second one in a pinch. 
---
They have an option for every spec and every situation and have the most Stam when geared. And the best cc skill. There’s more. You can spec a slow. You can steal mana. You are impervious to being interrupted because you just spam fire spells and dare them to waste it while the dots tick and the night fall procs. The more targets you have the more night fall proc chances you have and more life steal opportunities you get. And I don’t remember when they changed it but at one point Siphon and drain life ignore MS debuff. 
---
Warlocks are the tits 1v1 with ok gear and if only gets better as you go up. Played correctly even a rogue with all his cds can still be beaten.

#nochanges

Rofl, NE priest. Wasted R14.

I think later expansions expanded on the lore

Exact same.
---
No one will want them because they're garbage. There's your answer.

Can you get the tiny one in the background?  The greyed-out dead guy?
---
Is that 1 spec affliction?
---
Ayyyee
---
They're modeled after eastern european women.
---
&gt;What’s the real deal with Enh’s viability?
---
The 39 and 49 twink bracket.
---
its awful everywhere else in the game. Leveling is the exception and even then elemental is better after 40.
---
In 1.12 WF is nerfed in two ways, 50% less AP and can't chain off itself.  Mix that in with its general problems being kited in pvp, lack of mana and many skill mechanics like earth shock and storm strike being totally incompatible in a raid environment and you have a shitty spec.
---
Orc. There are so many undead on horde side their are less locks on alli side pvp because it’s not as easy as you can’t spam fear all the rogues off you.
---
Too long didn't read. Nobody cares about this shit.

I'm glad I'll be going with my private server guild so I don't have to socialize with shitters and safespace babies like 90% of this sub.
---
God, I can't wait to stomp all of you "etiquette babies" that haven't played this game in a decade, you have no idea what is waiting for you.
---
⚡️⚡️⚡️
---
Just because I get no enjoyment in classic leveling = "go play retail then"
---
The end game content in vanilla has made it my favorite game.
---
Well to be fair, it’s not that crazy lol
---
You keep saying your fondest memories are PvP, but a 60 against a 25 isn't PvP, that 25 is no more of a threat to the 60 than a grey raptor. The enjoyment you get from killing the person isn't because you have skill and out played an apponent, it's because you made someone's game experience that little but worse.
---
That's what he is saying. That enjoyment of an act that only has negative consequences for another player, without opportunity for rebuttal is what makes griefing an asshole thing to do.
---
Druids were also the least played class. 
---
I can definitely remember raids (both retail vanilla and pservers) where we were struggling to find ANY druid to come just to buff motw. 
---
To a degree, druids and priests in a raiding environment are interchangeable. Paladins and shamans have more niche roles (interestingly, somewhat opposite in terms of who they spend their mana healing). Priests are the most flexible class, but druids are the second-most flexible healing class. A raid would not struggle to clear content if they had say, 2 priests and 6 druids. In fact it is a common lament that there are so few druids when the 4th un-needed set of druid tier gear is getting DE's while some priests and shaman/pallies haven't gotten any yet. 
---
Druids aren't underrepresented in raids compared to the number of people who actually level them to 60. Hunters are vastly underrepresented, which reflects a realistic deficit that class has in fulfilling their role against multiple alternatives. 
---
It is perhaps surprising that druids are not more popular on private servers, but as far as demand for druids goes, it is fine compared to the other healers- except shamans. Shamans are used more in raids than their population would lead you to expect.
---
Some people don't even realize that rank change that happened in patch 1.8
---

If you level fast tailor.

Make bags. Lots of bags. People will drop tons on bags early on. And they aren’t too bad to farm mats for as a mage

Thunder Bluff wins hands-down in usefulness. Bank, AH and flight master within really close proximity. Best city.
---
Brother this is wonderful. Thank you.
---
There's a difference between acting like an asshole and making video content where one acts like an asshole. The being an asshole is(supposed to be) part of the entertainment... 
---
Jesus how can you not understand this.
---
maces
---
Oh yes. Trust me dude I was fucking pissed. Only Warriors and Shamans had 2hs and those were my 2 classes.
---
If blizzlike yes epic bow is phase2, but you need to remember that xbow is a VERY rare drop.
---
Indeed. I never really understood though, why 1 Shaman + 4 locks was not a common Group set up in Raids back in the days. At least not on my server.
---
Hordes most played race has a huge advantage towards warlock. If you want to pvp as a warlock you go Horde because it will be easier.
---
&gt;Also, what about a new npc in .Org and SW called Nost.... (pserver) name
---
No.
---
Why are the graphics in the first two screenshots so terrible?
---
Seconding priest!
---
I think it would be cool to offer it as an option just to see if a guild can finally eventually get it. You know there would be some guild out there trying for years if that's what it took.
---
You don't have that much rage spamming HS you just don't. Unless if you playing on some broken pserver with incorrect rage gains.
---
Not really no.
---
Woot woot

How do you think they did that guy reck mombed Kazzak back on live?
---
Thank you for the helpful answer! That Honor System link was pretty much exactly what I had been looking for, thanks! Still have a couple questions but am a lot less confused now!
---
I dont know why people are freaking out, it isnt like there will only be 30 guilds on Classic WoW.
---
SOME guild will need Warrior DPS or Mage DPS in raids. They are that fucking common that even with that, you'll be able to find a raid spot somewhere.
---
That first line is a doozy.
---
I'm an Ironman btw
---
yeah I play alliance range dps only. It's my favorite. I've tried melee dps (I used to have bad fps so this was harder), tanking, and healing.
---
Basically in Vanilla for me
---
no elemental shaman, no shadow priest, no Balance druid.
---
My only options are Hunter/mage/warlock of which hunter I heard suck in raids and from the looks of it here are very limited as well.
---
So leaves me to 2 options. Warlock and mage. Basically 2 of the 6 options are viable which sucks. 
---
1. Mages which everyone and their mother will be playing. They'll get good DPS but good luck getting in a raid because there will be millions of them
---
2. Warlocks which as an Alliance player will be easy to get in raids, but will do mediocre DPS until the later raids, will require soulstone farming, and will be easily destroyed by Horde undead with their wotf racial.
---
As a less hardcore player I don't know which to pick. Maybe warlock because it will be easier to get in groups when my gear isn't as good.
---
2h fury is viable on horde side. Not 2h arms. Arms is 100% leveling and pvp spec.
---
TB &gt; Orgrimmar
---
Wow thanks for that memory.
---
*Taking your time to enjoy the game*
---
***your time to enjoy the game***
---
**your time**
---
If only #nochanges still applied :\\
---
He's wrong. 2h fury is just fine for raiding, even better depending on weps. At top gear levels, then dual wield scales a bit stronger. But 2h fury is 100% fine and is even super strong on horde side with windfury.
---
Other guy is dumb.
---
Blizz doesn't use physical servers anymore. They use cloud based server technology. It isn't like the old days with server blades. If they need more servers, especially if they plan out with their server company, they can just literally flip a switch or call the company and tell them to open X more servers and have them open in minutes.
---
People did it all the time in retail vanilla in instances. It was very common for people to pay for instance runs while leveling up.
---
Classic is a recreation of the old times for better or worse. They said they won’t do balance changes.
---
If they did it would be opening Pandora’s box.
---
Isn’t really that difficult at all.  Get a good wand, spec into wand spec then just dot stuff, bubble and wand stuff to death.  Very little downtime due to little mana use.
---
Anyone who thinks this is toxic needs to grow a thicker skin.
---
Heh, fair enough. I usually try to grab The Rake no matter how inefficient it is to camp him. I guess the highest level wolves (Prarie Wolf Alpha) would be alright at the start since there's no focus dump like Claw anywhere nearby.
---
Does that mean you can't get exalted or does it just take longer?
---
Was a lot of fun being ignorant to what Ashenvale had in store for my Tauren.  Luckily always fun rather win or lose.  Luckily never camped there.
---
I wouldn't mind the inclusion of tribute NPC's at all. There's a plethora of them on retail, and adding them would be a change that I would certainly be okay with. The only problem would be tribute NPC's that wear specific sets of gear that would not exist in Classic. [Kimilyn](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kimilyn), for example, is a female undead priest that wears a specific set of cloth gear from MoP, and is meant to replicate the avatar of the player of the same name.
---
This is an interesting topic of discussion; one that I've thought about a little bit in the past few weeks myself. With how some tribute NPC's in retail wear specific pieces of armor from BC or beyond, it would be both difficult to represent them properly or to retain the "Classic" feel.
---
[Here's a list of all the known tribute NPC's in retail, if anyone is interested.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Category:Memorials)
---
orc fenale, yeesss
---
Dude I have not seen this before. I had no idea of the back story, thank you!
---
I don't know... 10 warrior. If I would be Raid leader, or otherwise having a say in Raid composition, having more than 8 of any class is to much.
---
Now I'm wondering though - will most classic Raids actually have the luxury to put together an "optimal" raid composition or at some point just take in any DPS/Healer class to fill the gaps.
---
I remember having raided MC and BWL (Horde) with 6 locks, 3-4 Hunters and I think something 6 to 8 warriors.
---
Wow, this community is more toxic than ever.
---
The guy made some effort to make something useful and people are complaining because of an ability listed from rank 2 or whatever.
---
Despite that, this is pretty accurate and you can use this as reference.
---
This was made upon request from other users so at least appreciate the guys work, if not, why don’t you make a better one and show us?
---
SM/Ruin
---
Damn. I wanted to go affliction.
---
Slow and steady. You don't kill mobs very fast, but if you play correctly you have absolutely zero downtime. Smart wanding + Spirit Tap means limitless mana, and Power Word: Shield with the occasional heal means you'll never die either. Not a lot to do, either. Just keep your bubble up, Mind Blast on cooldown, Shadow Word: Pain and wand to death.
---
I still think they should have kept something similar to this for every patch etc. Once they started to remove the need for these, professions went downhill as they weren't as important
---
*Most* of the newer models look absolutely fantastic... but why did they have to go and change their casting animations!? Agh.
---
Would be interesting to see. I would expect people to be able to clear it today.
---
&gt;Vanilla balance for raiding is not even close to "perfect"   
---
See? You are narrowing down everything to raiding. But raiding is only one aspect of the game. Maybe thats what you care about, thats fine. But its not universally true.
---
&gt; but we are the ones insisting on no changes.
---
I think 80% of the claimed #nochanges have suggested changes in some shape or form. Just saying, if this game design becomes a real issue in game, some subtle changes might be needed. I dont think that ppl landing after a flight not giving honor is "changing the game". 
---
Ppl kill you just for the fun of killing, no matter if they get honor from it or not.
---
Wtb TL;DR
---
Priest is one of the faster classes to level. They are very efficient levelers.
---
how much more than 30 points?
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
"Wherever I lay my head is home.
---
You see that rock? That's my pillow."
---
Pick what you want to play, enjoy it, and try to be the best at it, but you must always understand the most important choice in the game is what class you play because that defines life for you at 60 in what you'll be doing. If you enjoy Ret, great. Be the best Ret you can be. But understand that there are consequences at 60 for whatever choice you make.
---
But also, if we're talking about leveling, Paladin levels easier than warrior. Warrior is the weakest leveler pre level 40.
---
Classic WoW isn't what vanilla *should* have been. It's a recreation of what it was. The question isn't "why should/shouldn't it be this way." The question is "was it this way."
---
I'd ballpark it at around 8 and a half days. Maybe 9.
---
That's all
---
Hunter and holy priest.
---
&gt; We want Vanilla, but not with an ENTIRELY different priority on gearing.
---
I, for one, while played a sick number of hours in vanilla... if i geared my priest TODAY would do it ENTIRELY on different priority on gearing. Because now i KNOW whats coming in next patches to what itemslot. Then i didnt have a clue.
---
I would save certain resistance gear, because i know i need them later. You cannot put that genie back into the bottle.
---
All healing specs are viable at 60. Resto druid is pretty much the best end-game spec for druids, and I say that as a bear druid-lover.
---
People somehow think that someone can't think something is bad while playing it.
---
I personally played a human priest with full knowledge that Dwarves are better.
---
Then (November 2006): 22 year old medical intern, started playing with 3 friends after watching that SP episode, rolled warrior but gave up midway and finally leveled a priest
---
Now: 34 year old physician, married with a kid, well settled but loner gamer awaiting the return of glorious WoW classic
---
Yeah lock is weak at early gear levels but so what? You're in a 40 man raid giving loads of buffs and utility in the group.
---
I'm super late but this is something I wanna add. There were never 10 warriors in Vanilla raids. Sometimes up to 6 or 7, but not 9 or 10. The reason is because no one knew going in which classes would be OP. We have so much hindsight and knowledge now from the get go, and min maxing is more common, so this is what you get. I dont have a problem with it because I am treating Classic as its own thing - it's not Vanilla and that's fine.
---
Better yet add a statue remembering the Armenian Genocide.
---
true but the reason you get owl is for the screech ability, and the first pet to offer that is in westfall.  so you gotta run through wetlands, loch modan, dun morogh, tram to stormwind, run to westfall.
---

You can really tell the old RS players here. Focusing on armor and grinding..... when I first got to the Barrens on my shaman, I blew my wad on a matching white set of leather armor from the vendor ;) watch out plainstriders.
---
Some of you are alright.
---
Go undead rogue and gank lowbies in stv
---
It was useful to engage with a bigger crit on ravage!
---
spells with a cast time reset your auto attack swing timer
---
There's not much to come back for, but you do have class quests I believe. The only thing is I"m not sure if you're a human, if you are able to do the Dwarf class quests or not, or if they just give you a quest and send you to the human ones.
---
Regardless, there's nothing really that you risk missing, but you will miss Deadmines and not have quests for it if you don't do any Westfall.
---
Sounds to me like you just need to play the game when it comes out.
---
Please make one for warlock :D!
---
yeah the quests are too few and give very little rep. You have to grind cloth and hand it in.
---
Thanks. I'll test this one out!
---
Thats a private server thing.
---
The worst offender is their jump animation. Who raises their arms above there head when they jump???
---
Same.

---
Its not that druids are BAD, its just that adding more then 2 druids doesnt really make any sense. On other classes you gain more buffs and raid improvements by adding (up to a limit) a extra, lets say paladin. On druids, thats not the case, but still they are really good in the part that they do. They get SUPER fed on gear, zg enchants etc.
---
don't we all fondly remember 2004-2006 where people who spend more then 2h in game every day were called no-lifers and society looked down on them?
---
thank you for this beauty
---
Back in vanilla, innervate was a HUGE thing. It was reserved for the guilds best priests (sometimes even multiple innervates on same guy) and used on cd on every fight. Now, on private servers its barely even mentioned.
---
Of course there's a fucking video about this.
---
I have a headache 🤕.
---
However, I’m jealous at your lack of knowledge, I wish I could experience the Fresh in RL too haha
---
They sat around for 3ish hours letting a druid randomly crit a paladin.
---
This was on Doomhammer US.
---
So many late nights grinding!
---
Yeah, let me faction transfer my pally.
---
I guess they used achievements in later expansion to do the same thing. It's just that not everyone cares about achievements.
---
You are confusing the "right way" to play the game with the most optimal way. Not everyone wants to play the game at absolute peak levels of optimization
---
Undead female
---
this is absolutely irrelevant information and affects your gameing experience exactly not at all.
---
not once in 10y of playing vanilla wow was this ever a problem.  
---
idk why you are so desperate to make it one now.
---
You like female orcs but not female night elves?
---
But I enjoy the game the most when I am rushing to 60 right at server launch. :(
---
fake news, all priest are dwarves
---
Well it’s not necessarily for the money. It’s more about being selfsufficient for the consumables.
---
The amount if money you don't make from vendoring quest gear puts you way behind the curve in the mount money grind. I was tailor enchant on my mage from day 1 to retail and was always having to bum gold from buddies for big purchases up until wotlk made enchants you could sell on vellums
---
MC/BWL stages salv is better, WF+Troll tank after that should be better (comparing to a warlock). Obviously WF doesnt give same boost in threat against other melee.
---
I dont think tanking a BOSS ppl are rage starved, due them dualwielding with deathwish and low armor.
---
The propaganda is backfiring! Now everyone will take a vacation on release day!!!!
---
Say Faerie Fire (feral) quickly 10 times.
---
Warlock and Hunter being able to solo Mara might compete with Rogues. But they will be quite good at farming in phase 1, yes.
---
WoW on a private server, natch!
---
Dying light was good and can be played co-op. It’s cheap too.
---
Given how many players are experienced wow veterans, I wonder if we'll have enough dps? Lots of experienced players I know tend to gravitate toward tanking / healing. Has anyone done a survey? I don't want to level a warrior only to find there's too many warrior tanks at 60 and struggle to find a guild. Thoughts?
---
You'd have to farm for 3 hours, minimum to really make a profit, right?
---
50g to spec from combat to sub. 50g to spec back. Thats 100g down the drain automatically.
---
That's not what I asked at all, but ok.
---
Thecearly DYNAMIC internet
---
Some say the new models look fantastic, some say they look like weeby anime characters.
---
Seconded. There are lots of little changes that don’t matter in isolation but they each weaken the no changes argument and collectively affect the game negatively.
---
I remember, but didnt take part. Was still on my leveling journey back then :)
---
Was actually thinking about drake fang talisman which is bis for melee, hunter and tank (for threat). But yeah the caster and healer trinket will also have a lot of competition.
---
OP is telling people "the right way" by saying they should take it slow and enjoy the game, not pserver elitist.
---
Lmfao. Thank you for using meme correctly.
---
I know its not really Multiplayer but Anno 1800 is coming out tomorrow, at least in Europe. Gonna be a great and relaxed game ;) Good for filling the time until classic hits
---
This is excellent! Although would it kill you to throw in the total somewhere? xD
---
That's because this post is hypocritical, it makes fun of people who "tell others how to play the game", and by doing so, tells you how to play the game instead.

Id say its more deadly on horde to have tremor totem not ticking fast enough the fear off a tank and nef ofc does a fire breath on the same time. At least on the add phase you are in control of it.

BUt also you dont want to buy everthing as a lot of it is useless and you want to keep money for lvl 40 mount etc.

I would say it's more for the fun aspect.

---
I'll take April 15th.
---
They're rare enough that it won't matter. The earliest I encountered any were at level 24. Wanding/fire blast will suffice if you absolutely must kill them.
---
Just play league of legends, stay updated on reddit about classic, and hope it’s soon
---
I’ve always quietly longed for new classic content. The game was planned to have much more but they were forced to rush initial release and then forced to rush TBC so we never even got to see it. Unfortunately the people who were designing it are probably long gone so there’s not much point in hoping
---
Sounds efficient and effective although it also sounds kind of boring lol.
---
Priests can?
---
Indeed, not that great against multiple mobs, because usually fear is like asking for more trouble and MC isnt always a option. Not that you die from it, but it means some downtime. Getting shadowform just makes things a lot faster because your dps increases AND your incoming damage does too.
---
The people who are shoving ‘take your time......man.....’ are just as annoying as those who are shoving ‘got to go fast’ down our throats. 
---
Fuck both of you , I’ll play exactly how I want to play

woah, icutyou here, stumbled across this post by chance. good to see some old names! i miss the old nathrezim crew.

I'd rather hear news about beta testing than the release date.

Hahahaha apparently wow was playable on a 56k modem. Amazing!
---
I remember making a tauren alt way back in the day, back when i was a kid. It was way past midnight when i passed by this guy, i was probably tired and didn't really pay attention to the game. Anyway the npc had a custom sound file that sounded nothing like a tauren, so when i heard the whispy "have you seen my dog?" From what sounded like a teenager, i legit thought some random psycho had walked into our house in the middle of the night and was whispering in my ear (i had earphones on) because he couldn't find his dog.

I learned by far the most from PvP. And I dont mean hardcore premade pvp or arenas later on but just normal bgs and duel. Lots and lots of duels. PvP is a more stressfull place and more diccisions are need to be made on the fly.
---
Watching PvP videos and regonizing all S-tier moves. Understanding why they did ability A instead of B.
---
Understanding class limits and perkz will help out alot in PvE.

Many thanks friend :) i was waiting for this one since i'm a lazy scrub
---
back in retail when tagging was a thing the blue post on this regarding people that wanted to use multiboxing to powerlevel their own alts was something like "if they want to put in the money and effort to set all that up we're ok with it"   
---
 
---
**Vrakthris – Support Forum Agent 6/29/2012** 
---
		Tom Chilton: \[Laughs\] Well, we actually are perfectly content to  endorse multi-boxing to some reasonable degree. If a person wants to go  out and buy a second account and power-level themselves, we’re okay with  that.  
---
		Patently false. All accounts should be allowed to be played as they  see fit provided that they’re playing within our policies. In cases of  mulitboxing, all accounts involved are playing the same as any other  account, only simultaneously.

One of the easiest classes to level up to 60. Pretty much 0 downtime thanks to spirit tap. I don't think I even had to drink water while leveling.

Warlocks are quite good solo, them having pets is a huge plus and they have good life drain abilities if needed.

A good few weeks of playing what I didn't like, until I found a general role I wanted. Then a few more weeks researching the splitting differences.    First was hunter, until I wanted to be more melee.  Warrior until, I wanted to be able to support.  I chose Enhancement Shammy, and I guess actively chose hell even till this sad retail day.
---
This is a good tip for Horde hunter players who want to level using survival. By survival spec I mean how it's supposed to be played and by just a bad MM style or pure melee at the other extreme.
---
It's a damn fun way to level a hunter as an alt that you can feed better gear to as it's gear dependent.
---
Screech is highly beneficial because of it's AP debuff on the mob and the fact that the hunter enters melee far more often. AP debuffs work well on mobs and works well with the the so called "melee hunter" concept.
---
Any reason for wanting a screech pet outside of this, is far less of a benefit that you believe it is.

tanks and healers will always be the least played. Especially in Vanilla where it is even harder to exist as a tank or healer since you can't just go out in the world and swap specialization to do other content like retail wow.

The only reason why owl is a thing is because the nelf start has an owl that offers rank 2 claw... So yeah fuck owls!
---
I recently tried playing that on the switch for the first time. Man that game really does not explain anything. You just start of dying in all sorts of ways untill you get good. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
---
Yeah. Not a big deal either way but would be more fun to not know in advance.
---
True elitists don’t pug. They have alt groups that clear almost the same if not the same as their main groups. (

fuck that

Rejoice, its used a lot again by AoE farming mages in confined spaces.

They are super efficient, but at the least, hunters, warlocks, and druids all level faster than priests, mages can too.  They're simple and effective but they're middle of the pack for leveling speed.

how about people just enjoy it whatever way they fancy

Oh well. At least you'll get to cyber-bang a 300lbs dude playing a female NE hunter named Allyria.

As a horde tank I'm glad if I dont have to use sunder, because a rogue uses expose armor.

I can now use revenge even easier, shieldslam, HS and overpower. 
---
The more special attacks giving me windfury procs the better!
---
When are they gonna release what date they're releasing the release date though?
---
No
---
Now this is a meme.
---
tbh i think first cou0le days is the worst time to take off work unless you are confident and practiced enough to get ahead of the pack and stay ahead.
---
there will be a lot of players fucking up quests, queues possibly, server stability issues.  
---
I think id rather take time off end of first week or start of second week or even a bit later depending on how things go.
---
assuming the release has issues and the servers are packed you easily could loose the best part of 24 hours in the first few days
---
a top tier guild will also help out their warriors. because, you know, they need 8+ of them.

This reads like a nervous teenager asking his crush if she's found someone for the end-of-year prom. Written on a little piece of paper wedged in between her locker door.

Lol yes please

i mean no harm, i’m just a filthy casual that wants to play classic
---
KCD is worth it in my opinion, don't let the beginning put you off if you can!

These over zealous casuals are more toxic than the elitists they decry

How so?

Youve got mount on 40 but not 60, why not?
---
Really like these, good job.
---
I had never even thought of it til recently. Forgot where I heard it
---
If I was in that situation (doesnt matter what side) I would probably settle for both paying half of the new PC
---
I'm offended that your name isn't Bucnasty. Although it's a cultured name, so it was probably taken long before your conception.
---
Everyone should be able to choose how to play the game.

You see that guy over there?

Under no circumstances should you ever do what he is doing you fucking brainlet.

Final step would be making a leveling addon that shuts down your client and opens up your browser to an Alan Watts video about music and life if your XP/hour goes over a certain value

This
---
Soooooo boring. Every video or forum post you'll find will tell you how efficient it is as long as you keep a good wand the whole way to 60. But seriously - SW:P, Mind blast, PW:S, Wand is all you'll ever do. Maybe Mind flay if you are feeling fruity.. That whole rotation. All the way to 60. I will not be playing priest again this time D=
---
Yes
---
Kind of the same boat. The only Alliance race I don't dislike the look of is Gnomes. Gnomes, I find kind of bouncy and cute, and I love the cheesy nerd jokes. 
---
Humans are just kind of bland looking, Dwarves are ugly as sin no matter what you do with them, and the voice work for both humans and Night Elves just sound like the VAs were wholly uninterested in trying to sound energetic.
---
I might give Dwarves a shot as a backup plan, but humans and nelves are just kind of right out.
---
One of the gnomes was named July, if you searched the other one on Google there was a wow related result with a player called that and it was a first kill on the 16th of something.
---
just out of curiosity, i was looking at blizz track record in terms of how long before release date do they announce an actual date.
---
For Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition:  Release date announced on **May 2014**, released on 19 **August.**
---
For Overwatch: Release date announced on **March 2016**, released on 24 **May.**
---
**For wow bfa:** Release date announced on **April 5th, 2018**, released on 14 **August 2018.**
---
As seen here blizz announces release dates for games 2-4 months prior to release.
---
The worrying thing is that, if by the end of April, blizz has not yet announced a fixed date then the summer release will most likely not come until late August (20-31) September (1-20) 2019.
---
And thus their comment about "get ready for a classic summer" was a big bait.
---
Lets say they announce the release date tomorrow (crazy thought), then it would align perfectly for the 3 months prior to 16 July (the suspected release date).
---
"Those guys are so elitist! My way is the only right way to play the game!"
---
The further into the game you get, the less freighty they feel though. :(
---
A warrior with WF support will hulk smash much harder than any enhancer and shamans are *the* class doing 69 with warriors.

Constant sucking each other off.

Nope, just a spammer. Downvote and report, please.
---
Ion wasn't on the team when they were making vanilla...
---
I’m gonna shift my 3 days off to release date and take one paid day for a 4 day vaca. Sending the wife and kid out of state to visit family. Yes they agreed to this
---
Building a guild of former players from 05-06 and tbh it’s very mixed, for the most part people are just switching role type (former tanks are going dps, healers are going dps, and former dps are going to the other two)
---
Do you need potions when leveling? Except some mana potions, I never bothered.
---
Well actually all non-naxx runs are from a different server that doesn't have naxx open (the most popular server)
---
But yes I'm working on getting older dates in order to have the progression class breakdown now, will just take a bit more time!
---
You'll have 5 years to rack up experience before level 60 anyway
---
Confirmed. Get hyped bois!
---
I mean yes and no. Classic will require some degree of commitment as an old school mmo it is quite are to do anything if you don't put the time. It would be wiser to just start a battleground on classic for a quick game rather than play retail. So you at least get some honor/reputation to buy some gear.
---
Yikes
---
havent played wow for 10 years. so i will not.
---
I remember that was one of the reasons I was so excited hitting 60 - I could finally save up money from mobs / quests because I wouldn't need to spend it all on skill ups!
---
Mage. The quality of life from teleport alone makes it worth
---
Ahh... Did not know that
---
Do we know how thats going to work in classic? Will it be the system where you pay ever-increasing amounts of gold to respec? Or will there be no respecs at all?
---
If you play warrior it's around 11 days
---
delet this
---
Netflix isn't proper vanilla you heretic.
---
It is increasing gold up to a max of 50g.
---
Pretty sure the set bonus requires tailoring to activate
---
Circle the month of release please
---
June
---
July
---
August
---
Never
---
Maybe
---
Most recent 200 of each raid on most popular "servers". So 800 raids in total. But each guild weighted equally.
---
Season 3 in 8.2 is expected to release July 16.
---
Rewatching the whole thing right now, up to season 5, it's amazing how much I forgot and how many epic details I missed the first time around.
---
They won't be as weak as they are on pservers at the start since we're getting 16 debuffs from the beginning aka shadow weaving
---
Can confirm. Came back to check out BfA and quit right as the second raid was released as the game is just downright boring. Farming some magic currency so my necklace gets stronger so I can put some bootleg "item talents" to use is just not very enjoyable.
---
I am honestly curious as to where Blizzard plans to take retail Wow as in my opinion it just gets worse and worse.
---
Then : 11 y.o noob, playing vanilla because of my sister's boyfriend. Dreaming about azeroth at night and no easy life at school. (your typical nerd).
---
Now : 26 years old civil engineer, fiancé, no kids but money, pumped to dive into azeroth again after getting bored by BFA
---
Okaaay.
---
I as a warrior sure as fuck will roll on +spirit/stam rings before level 30, because it's strong af attribute pre30.
---
I take level 59 healers and caster DPS all the time when I'm tanking.
---
I take arms warrior over fury when they arent geared yet for dungeons. Sweeping strikes + whirlwind &gt; all when wielding IBS or another good 2hander. Undergeared fury farming preBiS lacks hit and you rarely fight one mob at a time. Arms cleave shines in dungeons.  Hence there is no "correct" spec for dungeons. When I run a level 60 dungeon with respawns like gargs in strat or very long ones like LBRS and I got a competent resto druid, I will recruit a shadow priest or elemental/enhancer for rezzes over a mage/rogue. 
---
I have no obligation to help anyone ever at all in PvP. If I don't feel like PvPing that day and get flamed for not helping that person will go right to the ignore list.
---
Because Jay Wilson.
---
It's going to be a problem in pvp but it's manageable in pve. It just take time to adjust and you can't really make split second clutch play for obvious reasons.
---
Just pop an invuln potion and you pretty much invalidate their existence.
---
I'd rather look like this guy than have a wife and kids
---
You live in Japan, but you never state on what server you are going to play, so this question is unable to answer.
---
I couldn't justify playing retail because it's too expensive for what it offers to me which is new raids and some arenas but now with shared subscribtion I think it could be worth it.
---
just enough time to get me from level 1 to 20!!
---
This was so epic.
---
While it's never ideal to play any role with high MS from experience of playing on US servers with Aussies they have done fin in their respective roles because their MS is consistently high and doesnt fluctuate. Regardless of MS its manageable unless its constantly in flux.
---
What is love?
---
I will try to make them slow and steady over the following week or so. I have optimized the workflow so one takes around 30 minutes now, so it is doable.
---
This applies to almost all games in that era. I think Bioware is the pioneer for cutscene'd up RPGs and they just got started with KOTOR at that time.

This sub is turning into a war zone.
---
Woah woah, don't say stuff like that. We have cata babies amongst us now.
---
You are right! If you have a good eye, I made a [warrior cheat sheet](https://imgur.com/nk6cG43) and desaturated the colors on the less useful skills here. You can really see that you only level around 6 or so.
---
You have basically 3 specs for PvP as Lock.
---
SL/Nightfall: The tankiest spec, you are essentially rotting and waiting for nightfall procs to do burst.
---
SM/Ruin: You've got the best of both Affliction and Destruction tree. Your shadowbolts will hit really hard and nightfall + shadowburn is gonna give you big burst windows.
---
Conflag/Nightfall: The ultimate burst spec. You've got not only nightfall and shadowburn but also conflag. Also your searing pain and immolate hit a lot harder since you're talented for increased fire damage.
---
Thanks Pablo.
---
 May your tanks me strong and healers wise.
---
Alakazam was better because it tried to track AH price as well and had an overall better layout :P
---
Oh nice. Probably a fairly low p-value on that then haha. Now I’m curious what the first 200 clears of each on a fresh server looks like
---
Thanks blizzard. You guys are always so quick to respond.
---
..? I'm talking about the real original content plan. This isn't something from private servers. The ST quests were added in the ZG patch ORIGINALLY.
---
Not in my classic wow. He’s got his quest in retail.
---
No changes dude. I want all the NPCs in the right places
---
I really don't think it would be possible. We all had amazing gear, were using tons of consumables, and really had no chance until the change. Getting through Phase 1 was tough but Phase 2 was just impossible until the change.

The WC3 picture the *actual* first look at what Orgrimmar was like when it was introduced in the special Bonus campaign that followed Rexxar and his adventures.

The rexxar campaign is basically what got me hyped for WoW in the first place as it was the first taste of warcraft could be like in an open world hero-perspective instead of the usual RTS base builder.

Swapping the needed materials would also mean Swapping the spawn nodes. You cant Just expect people to farm the same amount of lotus as peacebloom without changing the amount available.

Gameplay automation scripts are not going to work in Classic.

US west. Sorry, I slipped “back in the states” in there but it wasn’t clear
---
If you want to be a dps, mage is easier to gear than a Spriest because every piece of gear needed by a Spriest will first be given to a mage/lock.
---
If you want to play heal as a priest, just go for it, healer in vanilla is the easy life.
---
What is the easiest class to play while leveling and/or at 60?      
---
My GF is keen to play classic but has never really played much WoW and I would like to get her playing a class that is pretty basic. She has expressed interest in Mage or Priest.
---
So theres a trick people might not know to counter stuff like this.
---
You will auto target things that attack you if you currently have no target.  The reason stealth sniper hunters work so well is they can feign death while the shot is in the air, preventing anyone from auto targeting you.
---
very windy
---
It's funny how people have a hard time understanding that different people like different things.

Thirding priest
---
You cant have 6 druids due to hots not stacking
---
You're right. I've read a bit of Warcraft lore and Orgrimmar really wasn't built until W3 events.
---
Blazefury medallion
---
I never understood how they made flamestrike look shittier than it does in warcraft 3.
---
They didn't begin the construction of Orgrimmar until The Frozen Throne's Orc campaign 'The Founding of Durotar' which involves a mini-RPG (prequel to WoW) where you control Rexxar and are tasked with different quests to do around Durotar, The Barrens, Dustwallow Marsh, and Theramore.  
---
I think they began gathering the resources in the Reign of Chaos campaign 'The Invasion of Kalimdor' though, when Grom is tasked to gather resources in Ashenvale and ends up fighting the Night Elves and Cenarius.
---
Repost
---
First I ask myself what I want to achieve in the game, and then I look at my 3 chosen classes and made sure I picked the class with the highest probability of achieving these goals.
---
Yes that's why you have to keep tailoring until you can replace bloodvine.
---
I mean you wouldn't lie to me.
---
Would you?
---
Good info, but keep in mind your chances of getting into a raid group depends on demand as well as supply. Mages may be at 6.2 but a priest on 5 might find it easier to get into a raid if the server is packed with mages.
---
This is also sobering for the "play what you like" crowd. Yes, you should do what you enjoy, but if you enjoy raiding and playing a Hunter you may need to make a choice, or have a Hunter as an alt.
---
For leveling ease
---
A Tier: Hunter, Lock
---
B Tier: Priest, Mage, Druid
---
C Tier: Shaman, Paladin?(Never leveled a pala)
---
D Tier: Warrior, Rogue
---
Mage is great for leveling but has quite a bit of downtime drinking. Plus side is you can conjure water.
---
Priest is also easy to level. Shadow word pain, mind blast and wand until dead, you will get spirit tap in the shadow tree which will increase your spirit after killing a target and you'll pretty much never need to drink because of it. At 40-45 you can get Shadowform which is great.
---
You should've seen it before hypothermia and forbearance were added
---
&gt; Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter. Remember to play nice, play fair folks!
---
Followed by:
---
&gt; It’s possible that abusive play could take the form of a group of four players colluding to deny loot to a stranger who joined their party as a pick-up.
---
So if one person ninja loots, they'll get a reputation and we should just shun them thereafter, but if four people 'ninja loot', they won't get a reputation and we shouldn't shun them thereafter.
---
If you refer to this graph [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis\_of\_private\_server\_40man\_raid\_composition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis_of_private_server_40man_raid_composition/)
---
Both mage and priests will be well represented in raids, but Priests will have an easier time getting spots. That being said, you're gonna be healing, son
---
R14 is insane. Expect these people to win premades for 18 hours a day for 3, 4 months.

Self control is bullshit? Also the law is not against me hear.

Ye 100% going healer if I roll a Priest, just concerned it will be difficult to find raid spots seeing as I imagine priests will be quite popular this time around
---
Lol you can straight up restealth again and again with improved gouge
---
You're the one spreading misinformation by only including your personal experience.
---
Sounds like your problem has been solved. You play what your friends play. It makes the game all the better to play with people you know. I'm going Alliance as well, just because that's where my friends will be. If I had it my way, I'd play Horde, but having a group that I can rely on to play with regularly is more than worth not being an Orc.
---
By burgers, be purged!

#NoChanges
---
Level 60 and dungeons is over really quickly, then what? There is literally nothing to do except roll alt or raid.
---
I tried replaying it actually but just couldn't get into it since I had already done it over a decade ago and it is still quite fresh in my memory since I did every nook and cranny.
---
I’m also rewatching it with my wife, it’s her first time. There is a ton of small foreshadowing regarding character deaths that you would never notice the first time around. We are also on season 5 now. I think the best scene so far is Jaimes exposition to Brianne in the bath; I never noticed how amazing it was first go around.
---
No wonder the Ice Cream machine broke, shits melted.
---
You covered Rogue and Warrior, I still need Hunter and all my friends will be happy :)
---
I’m not sure why people think it will be hard to get raid spots. It’s a fucking 40 man raid that is a shit ton of people compared to current WoW. If you are playing a mage or priest you will be fine. It’s the people playing the hybrid specs like ret Paladin that will have more difficulty but even they will have some people willing to take them.
---
Your post will probably be auto taken down for "choose a class Wednesday" 
---
What a piece of shit filter that is
---
Totals up to 202.9 gold for all spells excluding the mount. Pretty crazy.
---
underrated item!
---
I miss my old Tank Warlock and DPS Shadow Priest.
---
Were my favorite before the skill tree changes shat on my builds.
---
But it's not close to the zeppelin, which is why almost everyone will have their HS set to ORG.
---
Got my account hacked in cata, deleted all items off 10 of my max level toons. What did Blizzard do to compensate? Gave me 850g per character so I could buy new gear.......
---
I guess I should've said "I hate that druids aren't wanted/needed." They're perfectly capable, it's just that priests/shamans/pallies are all better and more desirable. 
---
I'm sure if I managed to get a raid spot I would do perfectly well on a druid, I'm just not looking forward to the search with my real life limitations combined with playing a class most raids could take or leave. If I had a guild lined up ahead of time I would probably be a lot more likely to play a druid.
---
I never played the Warcraft III campaign, this makes me want to. Is the story good?
---
You should totally do a quick and dirty MC/BWL/AQ one, this was glorious and spot on.
---
download bfa go play around and see how well ot performs, it will be more similar in terms of classic
---
Gonna use these two sets of data for my arguement.
---
What class are you gonna play (10000 data entries)
---
https://imgur.com/a/e4uOSND
---
Raid compositions in the different instances.
---
https://i.redd.it/gr3xmh9ky9s21.png
---
Judging from this we can say that on average a guild is gonna want  5 priests and 6.5 mage in a raidgroup.
---
Looking at what people are gonna roll
---
12.6% priests and 13.5% mage.
---
If we took those percentages and put that into raidspots that would give us
---
12.6% priests = 5 raidspots
---
13.5% mage = 5.4 raidspots
---
So judging from those datasets it seems like it would be slightly easier to get a raidspot as a mage when you compare it to the total population.
---
Though because there's generally more mages than priests in a raid there will be more people to share the gear between.
---
I would not base my class decision on this data personally. However if you like both classes equally I would say roll priest. I would expect the "non-reddit community" to be more skewed towards rolling mages than priests, especially on launch so there will most likely be a bigger demand for priests.
---
I played a paladin to 60, but didn't quite get to do raiding as Nostalrius was shut down before I could do that.
---
If I were you, I would just level alone as waiting for the other is just a pain for you and for your friend. Paladins are one of those few classes that can handle quite the mass of mobs with a proper consecration build. You do have to drink pretty much after every (2nd) pull.
---
Play through the Mass Effect trilogy, if you are into the Story/RPG games. 
---
I have just recently started another play through after 5 years and am having a blast. 
---
Even though the first instalment is over 10 years old, with MEUTIM mod (improved graphics) it looks amazing and the game's story seriously sucks you in for hours.
---
You could also try some of the Elder Scrolls games, they last for hundreds of hours as well.
---
There were add-ons in vanilla you nonce.
---
90% of guilds will be FRESH ;) so finding raid spots won't be hard

Posting because this video is the reason I ever tried a shaman and ultimately became my first level cap ever. Why did you pick your first race/class?

Yeah it wont be a problem. I know many people who have gamed WoW on Macs during the years.

What is the redridge equivalent for horde that alliance likes to camp?

Remember people you see on this sub is only 10% max of the classic community.
---
I play sham on a Pserver and people never woe at me for not playing resto.
---
On the contrary, they're generally delighted to have a "rare" spec in their group.
---
Will you do less damage than a mage? Yes and so? windfury totem alone will increase the damage of your melee more than what another mage would bring on the table in terms of damage + you have mana totem, resurrection, off-heal,... 
---
Everyone is glad to have a shaman in the party because it brings so much utility but if you look only at the damage meter, yes, you'll not be first.
---
Stonetalon mountains, arathi highlands and hillsbrad
---
While I think you're right that this guy is allowed his fun, the average player on live is 20x better than the average player in 2004-2006, the average player is probably better than the best players on most realms in 2004-2006.
---
Depends on what you want to do. I'll most likely play Enhancement Shaman in Classic as a starting character, which the main goal of that character will be PvP. I remembered it as fun as hell. It's a bit RNG with Windfury but the satisfaction of the proc + the durability of fast self-heals and supporting totems was great! 
---
I really enjoyed it and I remembered Shamans being a class with really good endurance in a PvP fight.
---
As I loved Enhancement it wasn't as fun when it come to PvE, which in most cases required you to respec to Resto or if lucky, Elemental. It all boils down to what you want to do in Classic. For PvE I would most likely go with another Class if Resto isn't you thing.
---
I’ll actually cry if the games unplayable during the launch week I take off work lol.
---
Oh man that triggers my PSTD. Why is it always undead rogues
---
It's gonna suck until you get your first wand. After that it is smooth sail to 60.
---
It can be good to keep your wand up to date, so maybe plan out a wand progression so you know when to do specific quests to get a better wand.
---
Nope this is the first time it's actually been done right.
---
The Forest is a decent multiplayer survival game. Only survival game I like, really. I think it allows you to play with up to eight players, perhaps even more
---
Orc combat daggers rogue. Extremely satisfying to play, scales well and not as dependant on gear as swords. Enables you to pvp/pve with 1 spec and excell at both of them (this isn't the case with combat sword rogues). Orc provides a potential stun resist against your two worst enemies, other rogues, and warriors (intercept and charge will murder you otherwise). And the cherry on top is Bloodfury, a scalable attack power buff that is akin to Earthstrike, one of the best melee trinkets in the game acquired through quests near the release of AQ, your backstabs will hit incredibly hard making it arguably the best class specific racial for any class in the game, your backstabs will hit so hard with Bloodfury+ adrenaline rush/thistle tea. PVP and PVE rogue dream combo.
---
You can add : Windfury totem :) !
---
The other post deserved a good mocking!
---
Math was discovered after the release of TBC. Before that we only knew to count up to 10.
---
I'll be tanking. So Warrior. We are rolling Alliance. And I like Elwynn Forest. And sword specialization is a bonus. So Human.
---
I would enjoy that myself
---
Thanks for the cheat sheet. I don't think a slight desaturation is enough to highlight the less useful skills, but maybe it's just my eyes.
---
Pretty sure that’s what the post is saying
---
Fuck that loser.
---
To be fair, the other post fired the first shot
---
I‘m curious on the original blizzard procc rates
---
Lul
---
Does not proc off Ironfoe, sadly.
---
I really like the gadgetzan engineering teleport makes things nice ☺️
---
I was mostly speaking to people who havnt played it yet.
---
And iirc this is a top guild? He doesn't even have elixir of greater firepower or elixir of fortitude. Basically mediocre guilds today are better than top guilds then. Let alone mediocre guilds back then.
---
Druids are insane in patch 1.12. They don't have high representation in 40-man raids because HoTs don't stack. They're the only class that actually gets worse the more you bring.
---
Those one or two Druids though? Raid MVP. Representation is not the same as viability.
---
The Warcraft III campaigns are the best campaigns in RTS history, second only to those of StarCraft and Brood War, IMO. But that's my opinion. That said, I REALLY recommend playing them. Especially with classic coming out, this is the perfect way to prepare lorewise!
---
I'm beginning to think Classic is a massive troll and it's not coming out. It's only 47 days to summer. It's stupid a release date isn't advertised yet. How can anyone plan their vacation? Why are Blizzard being such dicks about this.
---
Australians clear raids on pservers with everyone on 300+ ping so its doable. Personally I don't enjoy playing melee with the lag so I play caster.
---
Outward
---
Then: 10 yr old not even knowing english, buying those sweet green items from ah at level 15 because they have more armor (plus 5 int for a warrior tho lmao)  
---
Now: 22 yr old, graduated, pretty chill IT support job, ready to play that vanilla with a conscious mind
---
Who in their right mind would force their guildmates to RP in the guild chat? :o
---
&gt; You will need Tailoring when ZG comes out, but you will unlearn it as soon as you craft Bloodvine.
---
Bloodvine set is BoE. It's the set bonus (2% spell crit)  that requires being a tailor.
---
Unlearning tailoring after learning it to just make Bloodvine Garb makes no sense at all.
---
Welcome to Discrete Mathematics 101:
---
500 HP - 100 DMG = 400 HP  
---
400 HP - 100 DMG = 300 HP  
---
300 HP - 100 DMG = 200 HP  
---
200 HP - 100 DMG = 100 HP  
---
100 HP - 100 DMG = 0 HP  
---
Hits to Kill = 5  
---
500 - 110 = 390  
---
390 - 110 = 280  
---
280 - 110 = 170  
---
170 - 110 = 060  
---
060 - 110 = 0  
---
Hits to kill = 5  
---
Since melee crits are 2x, there is no risk of partial hits that would not already be partial hits.  (His argument is still fallacious, but technically sound)
---
Crit gives more combo points in cat form = more damage per energy.  
---
Crit gives more rage in bear form = more threat
---
Agi gives more armor = more suitability  
---
Agi gives dodge  
---
Both STR and AGI are insane for druids, especially alliance druids.
---
We all are (except for the small portion of the private server community that believes they are 100% accurate with their 15% ironfoe proc rate)
---
Are...are we the bad guys?
---
You could even automate your rotation with a macro in vanilla lol. My point is different. I'm asking them if they _would_ use that addon.
---
What enchants to go with this?
---
I dunno dude I have a pretty kinky female orc look.
---
depends on the content phase, Once ZG is out some of the mages best pieces are crafted. so not super hard to get
---
Cool :) ill check them out tomorrow! only RTS campaigns i ever played were the Age of Empires campaigns
---
its cool and stuff, but you wont use trash blade when you get access to the other items. plus iron foe is just a bit rare^^
---
I'm sorry, but I feel like warrior and especially rogue are low on your list. 
---
Rogue is a very decent leveller once you account for poisons and bleeds, making it possible to deal fine damage without great weapons.
---
Warrior is tricky but if you have enough experience with the class, then I would put it above shaman. 
---
Shaman to me is bottom class.
---
God man this has so many memories for me!
---
WE’RE MC RAIDERS!
---
They already tried with Vanguard ...
---
Playing together is so much more fun. If you want to play when the other one isnt online just play another character.
---
Old Rag'Donald had a farm, EYA EYA OH
---
Huh, Ive never had those issues on the pserver named after a certain place in Eastern Plaguelands. The language and text stuff is probably because You're using a German client (Just use the English one like everyone else) and the mob spawns I've seen extremely rarely (And I have 1, almost 2 capped toons).
---
teach me sensei.
---
Congratulations. Now you can have no life, never leave and never have anything stolen again.
---
As fury you could use it in on
---
 as rogue ok would use the fast 1.5 lvl 50 sword until u get the quest reward sword miras song
---
Skyrim
---
vanilla pvp is so pure!
---
He's on his knees somewhere in a board room right now.
---
this guy dads :D
---
Thrash blade roughly equals bloodrazor dps in mc though
---
&gt;  If there is a good way to get 800-1000 gold before even reaching level 60, sign me up.
---
Not faster than first getting to 60 for then to start farming. If you don't know where to quest at 31 I would start working on a route instead of worrying about 1000g.
---
Give me three Hail Mary's and a LEEEEEEROOOOOOOOY JEEEEENKIIIIIIINS!
---
More shit talking of private servers with false information. It's currently at 1 ppm on the biggest pserver, which is a 4% proc rate. 
---
Previously it was on 1.5 ppm, which is 6%, but new data arrived that apparently seemed to show 1ppm, but there's really not so much data on this as few people did long proper tests that verify procrate back in vanilla.
---
there are many easy to get weapons that are much better at that point.
---
Definitive proof that Shaman is more OP than Paladin. ^^^^Hides
---
Considering you're early 12 years old right now I have my suspicions about your claims regarding a 15 year old game.
---
Damn, this is what I love about Classic! The fun effects! 
---
Is this combo viable in the 60s? Would love to do this as a 60 fury warrior (at least until raiding)
---
At work, will update in a few hours (´-ω-`)
---
&gt; and guilds took more effort to make
---
10 signatures to be exact
---
No they did work in a crisis situation then expected them to pay after the work was already done. also onyxia
---
Bullshit, hunters shine in MC
---
Hunter druid tiers are the first to be disenchanted
---
There's literally nothing wrong about playing a emulation of a game that is no longer being provided.
---
Nobody is buying flask for every raid, what's the point of spending 200g for a raid on farm ?  Even for progression most guild dont even use flask except the occasionnal titan on the tank.
---
Every raid need healers, don't worry about finding a raid spot you'll always find one.
---
Ok good because I want there loot.
---
\&gt;being a toxic casual
---
Some people enjoy min maxing, get over yourself.
---
I was a lock back in the day, I had decent gear and I could 2 hit full epic Warriors with destro specc. Before decent gear you should specc affli so you just dot fear and control the fights while other classes can burst easy in dotted targets. You can slow enemies or make them have to cast longer so it becomes easier for interrupt.
---
4 shamen are already occupied providing windfury for the warriors and rogues.
---
Wasnt the "new" data Steppenwolf relentlessly quoting the little crappy WoWvanilla comment in which some random bloke did the Blasted Servant attack proc calculation and it was preached as gospel in the rebalance discussion?
---
Only for Steppenwolf to try to revert it once he got the Empyrean Demolisher and the proc rate did not fit his prerogative?
---
AoE2 campaigns were also nice, but hard to compare since they are historical. Age of Mythology was also very nice, but WC is on another level. Great story, tremendous character development and great cutscenes/gameplay.
---
If you are doing BRD lava runs, you are at a point in which you can spend an afternoon in Scholomance to acquire Mirah's Song which is the best OH when not going for Dal'rend Set.
---
My advice: don't be a cunt. That's it. You can enjoy the game however you want unless you're a cunt about it.
---
I was referring to any number of shamans not necessarily a limit of 5. But yea if it’s 5 you are right
---
Just pay for the trip and they can’t say no lol
---
[Here's the google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRFveiADWwZgSEy5EkJjswBINS9A6Pf9R0PrLR38Pvn1_Q0axES2-EX7tCWlRQdxihnB3Sl-L5WByOc/pubhtml) so you can play around.
---
I think something along those lines yes.
---
I'm not gonna deny that steppenwolf is a cuck and that maybe 1ppm isn't accurate, the decision was made to go 1ppm instead of 1.5, it's really hard to argue which data is correct and which is not. Thus why none is or should be certain about the proc rate.
---
If you max out on wbuffs with a bear using MCP the dps can't really overaggro, same with a dw fury tank. Both that and your threat bouncing only occurs with very high-end try hard guilds doing speedruns.
---
For everyday stuff most dd classes have only a handful of skills they use during raiding and when going high on threat they just whitehit or wand a bit.
---
Good luck obtaining Ironfoe as a rogue, you will need it.
---
I think that taking mining while leveling won't hurt you as ingeneering is not really useful while leveling. If you succeed to be 60  early in the server's life, you'll have some trouble trying to be ingeenering mats at the AH.  
---
Once 60, i'd drop mining once you have all the mats to get inge 300, and forget it ad vitam. Find a good farming spot, get your 40-50g per hour  and buy from AH.
---
Ull never get IF, all tanks reserve it
---
Good luck reserving Ironfoe and not being the tank that run.
---
SFK is quite hard for his lvl if you don't have a class that can decurse and know that you have to kill the illusion wolf first
---
What do you have to backup this position other than your opinion?
---
Can I get a McExecutus with a side of perdition fries with a Sulfuras slushy?
---
The downside is warrior are the most gear dependant and the hardest to gear. They rely on alot of expensive boe (especially fury who might spend close to 10k gold if they really want the best of the best gear) while being the worst farming class. And with the amount of warriors who raid, raid loot will also be hard to get.
---
And if you dont put the effort you wont get rewarded. The nolife fury will top dps, the casual fury will be close to last even below hybrids.
---
i didnt mean the beginning i literally meant just starting it up and waiting for it to load in!
---
mind you i have an SSD ready and waiting for an OS and for my games to move onto it... that would help...
---
May 30. Because if it's ready, then why the fuck not?
---
I mean, I'm replying to a comment by a user who is also giving their opinion? Wasn't aware we needed to cite peer reviewed scientific studies backing up everything we said on the classic wow sub reddit?
---
I'm gonna have to disagree. I'll enjoy playing the game when it arrives, sure, but for now I'll enjoy learning things about the game. I guess we just have different preferences. Back in the day when you'd go out to the mall and pick up your new copy of Metal Gear Solid for the PS1 you damn well better believe I'm reading through the manual before starting up the game. It's just who I am.
---
We had to invent math in order to prove he was impossible.
---
Another reason is feral is more viable alliance side.
---
He can just get a druid to tank the place.
---
POE. Farming maps. Keeps the mind busy. Thinking of summer...
---
It did at one point xD.
---
Proc rate is only like 5% at best. So Ironfoe isn't bis.
---
There are better options sustained DPS wise, but you can roll with this combo. Also if it procs, especially in PvP, and it can proc off each other's procs as well as from its own procs, you can effectively 1 hit people.
---
so we should start hoarding from day one, got it.
---
I always organized my own runs back then because of this reason.
---
OMG! Thank you for the giggles! 
---
Again! :D
---
The horde hardcore guild on my server do that for their server first and speed run, but they also all have 3 alts to be able to split the war in 4 raids to get them geared.
---
How many bank alts do you want? haha
---
Oh man that narrator sounds like the whitest college guy ever. Nice fanmade trailer.
---
Undead. Warlock. Yep, that's it.
---
I hope they take (philosophical) notes from OSRS, which took a 2007 release and over 5-6 years focused used their RS3 history to make a really fun and different remake. It’s a totally different game and would be cool to see the same ideas with classic
---
a_bigbutt, you got a Happy Number in your comment ID! 
---
 The Happy Number is 847, and your comment ID was ekxg847.

 Here's a link to what Happy Numbers are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number. The comment ID is a unique 7 character string which identifies your comment in the sea of Reddit.
---
 (I'm a bot by the way, downvote to delete this comment)
---
The comment  "*All I remember was the number of bots. One Warrior in particular in vanilla got rank 14 just botting the entire time, he was on 24/7 in Battlegrounds. It didn't really require skill to get to rank 14, it simply required a massive time investment. The worst players in the world could get rank 14 by sitting in BGs all day, which isn't really a good way for things to be done. "*
---
I wonder the shit show / lengths people are going to go in classic to get r14. I wonder if streamers will use there stream to help.
---
What an insane story... Thanks for sharing
---
TBC on a private Server on the opposite faction
---
Thanos?
---
Ironically the fastest aq40 clear on [server] was for a while one done with 6 hunters. I shit you not.
---
Right? At the very least they'll have a discord for shooting the shit or people will use )) for out of character talk. G chat being pure RP sounds lame as fuck.
---
Casual RP guild? Lol
---
Tanks will snap up all big +hit items first, yeah.
---
You are right: https://imgur.com/a/zhahL2P
---
Every time I came back to WoW at different point, I played Warrior, my first ever class played. Leveled up again a Warr at the end of legion for main tanking in BFA. Was desappointed as fuck when 8.0 hit. Ho god, my boy was massacred.
---
I plan to go for a warrior again, to relive the sentiment of power from an OG warrior. And I miss 1 handed fury.
---
IIRC you got money for turning it in, right?
---
Anyone else skip abilities they never use?
---
Na. Im hopeful for some more content/class balance patches after Naxx. But not a TBC server
---
I would throw money at the screen if they did some sort of wow2 following vanilla philosophy, just vanilla oriented content, finish karazhan crypts, aszhara crater, etc.
---
Honestly I don't think any information you get here will help. Not that the replies are bad in anyway, but just that there is really no good way to pick a class based on the idea of getting geared easier than another class. 
---
I've been in guilds that had 10+ mages and 3 priests. I've been in others that had 4 mages and 8 priests. You could run mc 100 times and see 100 mageblades or you could see 1. I was in a guild that had so many eye of divinity's drop that every alt able to zone into mc had one and then we sold them to other guilds that hadn't seen it drop in months. 
---
At the end of the day it's all up to rng. So you may as well play the class you'll have fun with regardless.
---
If it happen multiple time in a row this is pretty bad since tank cant get more threat meanwhile healers and the damn caster that didnt want to stop still do.
---
You got signets, which you could turn in for a box that usually contained a random green and a few more signets.
---
He works for blizzard so you're probably not too far off!
---
Ah right.
---
Should be fine. 
---
I think you can get a trial of BFA or something and test it out, it should be similar in performance.
---
For me it doesn't really feel very "RP"-y to have messages teleport to players on the other side of the world. Gchat is for Gchat and talking with the people, not to RP in :p
---
I agree here. Would be interesting to play in an "alternate reality" kinda thing. Learn from the mistakes in modern day retail. Granted I think that the people that made the early game what it is are long gone, so I don't think I could trust activision to take the game in a new direction.
---
Reliving the glory days will have to do for now!
---
Mithril spurs
---
Good luck! Ironfoe is an insanely difficult item to get your hands on.
---
Funny thing is that I don't see anyone recommending speeding through, but I see "take it slow, enjoy the ride, don't rush" all the time.
---
Warrior is the most difficult class to level in classic. Don’t tell people otherwise (Y)
---
Stop poking me!
---
How do loot councils know in what order to assign loot? I'm more looking for classes rather than players. Like for example Vis'Kag from Ony. Do you give that to a tank or melee first?
---
Retail wow is dead
---
I played the first bit back when TFT was released but never got around to playing the rest. Is it possible to just jump right into mission 2 or should i just redo the first one?
---
What's the gnome in the background doing there? Is it the main ingredient?
---
They do in all other aspects of the game, so why not? :p
---
Their T2.5 set encourages it!
---
As a tryhard, i'm not taking vacation.
---
But i'm quitting my job.
---
Its awesome. One of the best RTS games of the decade and the story is one of the best seen outside of RPGs.
---
Neither swp or mind flay, being dots, should eat imp sb which is eaten by direct dmg spells only.
---
I still got my original cd key for wc2. Do you think it works on Win10?
---
I borrowed my friends enh shaman back in vanilla a couple of times and had an absolute blast with him. So for fun... 10/10
---
He has basically become a cult leader and crypto currency scammer..
---
I mean they waited for the entire thing to be finished before telling them.
---
The world record is believed to be 4 days and 20 hours. On a Hunter.
---
La Hire's sword eez not bloody enough!
---
i absolutely love that WoW kept so many icons from WC, it was just a nice continuity  
---
and then the shared history with Dota as well.  so cool
---
Mind Blast, DoT, Wand, wand, wand, wand, wand, wand etc

To add to this, for Alliance:
---
Smott's Compass: https://classicdb.ch/?item=4130
---
Nice mid game tanking trinket.
---
Totem of Infliction: http://classicdb.ch/?item=1131
---
Amazingly good tanking offhand from a duskwood quest reward - worth using all the way to 60.
---
Ring of Protection: http://classicdb.ch/?item=15855
---
Pre-raid bis tanking ring from Eastern Plaguelands quest chain.
---
Fordring's Seal: http://classicdb.ch/?item=16058
---
Pre-raid BiS healing ring from WPL quest.
---
The defias set is good if you do the Deadmines, and the Manual Crowd Pumeller from Gnomeregan is good even if you don't use the charges.
---
If you need armor around level 40 you can go to Booty Bay and buy this staff for 6g: https://classicdb.ch/?item=12252
---
At this point you could wait for the remaster, don’t know about your question I’m afraid.
---
Im curious if streamer guilds will be the best guilds outs there. Strength by numbers was the vanilla motto.
---
Statistically speaking, is this all just 1-2% chance on four different items, or could you call this a 3% (plus thrash proc) chance for extra sword strike? I mean technically you have a chance to strike 3 extra times on sword. Statistics are weird
---
TFW gaming is your job and you don't have to take time off in order to grind. FeelsGoodMan

Upvoted for best reply.

They can't really let other players play because that is a ToS violation. They can get into a premade though.
---
Not really.

I suppose you're talking about the trinket, right?

I’ve had no issue tanking in the past with around 300-350ms. You acclimatise fairly easily to the lag and stop noticing it.

Bear in mind, that was in 5 mans as opposed to raids but like others have said, consistent latency is better than spikes

---
+1 and the game never felt as meaningless as when they decided to add arbitrary pop ups to inform us what is an “achievement”.
---
I'm also convinced the average player is much much better.
---
Which is why Molten Core is going to be a breeze. It should be a 20man instance, and not a 40man by todays standard.
---
I think it's a relic from when Warlocks (and discipline priests) were originally going to have melee specs that never made it to release - Disc priest was going to be like those SM monks
---
Oh For sure.
---
Never said they would? The amount of people master looting them gear, and doing premades for them will be stupid.
---
It isn't hard as much as it will take a long boring time
---
My second toon during retail classic I got to 60 was a enhancement orc shaman. It was honestly the most fun I ever had pvping with a toon even after I played private servers on and off for the next ten years. 
---
Pre-nerf windfury was so god-like before they nerfed it — windfury used to proc off itself, giving you 5 swings if I recall correctly at once. I used to mow through 3-4 people easy in wsg in a matter of seconds if RNG Jesus was blessing me that day. One shotting clothies, druids/rogues, hunters sometimes and the occasional under geared warrior/pally. Was just so broken it was glorious if you weren’t on the other end of it. 
---
After they nerfed it though the spec never got its luster back. Your weaknesses were much more glaring (low armor, health, mana in certain cases) — you had to change your PvP strat to kiting people instead of just standing toe to toe with them and taking them down with brute force without breaking a sweat. 
---
The spec was still viable in PvP, but it just became super gear dependent after the nerf/fix. If you want the gear though you’re going to either have to no-life it to rank 14 or raid as a resto shaman and pick up the scrap loot after all the melee have gotten their gear. It’s competent if you have the gear for the spec — somewhat less than mediocre if you don’t.
---
Work Work
---
Dwarf priest! (Seriously guys, we’re going to help OP tank?)
---
I dont know, perhaps with cheat codes or some console commands. Either way, the campaign is VERY VERY good even by old blizzard standards.
---
This basically
---
This is actually very useful for me, very cool.
---
I will be playing warrior and mage.
---
They know. They'll give a release date when they're certain they can keep it.
---
And hence why private server info isn’t taken very seriously, no? Not trying to offend, just not following what you are saying.
---
I remember being in an RP guild when I first joined and the guild master "handing out stones of communication" so that we could talk IC in guild chat. Nope. Awful, awful idea.
---
What's wrong with rushing to 60?
---
I was dead set im going to play a priest.Tried a pserver a week ago and now I want to play a tauren druid.I accept i wont be the big guns healer,the QoL druid has are fitting me.
---
Nasty water quest or just escape gankers - aquatic form
---
You cant be bothered to fight - stealth and mind your own buiseness
---
Feral swiftness talent and travel form are so so sweet for leveling
---
You want to piss someone off - Roots and run in circles in travel form.
---
Now i just hope its my last change of mind.
---
True Classic players have a folder full of Iron Maiden and Green Day mp3s
---
Then I'll just have to play through all of it!
---
I knew what this was just by reading the title.
---
Good times. I am seriously considering rolling a 2h enha shaman in classic, against all odds. Get Treant's bane or Nightfall and just go ham.

Those are some nice potatoes !
---
Ironfoe may not proc off windury, but windfury can proc off Ironfoe no?
---
% damage reduction from armour in WoW is linear, so it'll give the same amount of damage for any class (providing they have at lleast x armour where x is the amount of armour you reduce)!   
---
(Using easy numbers for brevity):  
---
If going from 0-50% mitigation takes 10,000 armour, then going from 98-99% will also take 10,000. That's because the jump from both 0-50% and 98-99% mitigation provide the same overall physical damage reduction (50%), so require the same absolute amount of armour.   
---
So if your spell reduces 10,000 armour, you'll do 50% more damage, regardless of how much armour the target has to start with, assuming they have at least 10,000.

Did you get rep or any rewards for turning in? 
---
I was on a server where this was completed quite fast.
---
Nope I'm talking about the offhand weapon trash blade.
---
There are 2 better alternatives for rogues.
---
One is hanzos sword and the other is miras song, while the difference between both are about 1,5 dps preraid bis
---
Squishy in pvp.
---
Hard to kill opponents in pvp.
---
Always healer in raid.
---
People get angry if you dps in instance.
---
Usually always healer in instance.
---
Many people don't understand about healing in shadow form.
---
In very high demand as a healer in all circumstances.
---
Nah I wouldn't do that to him he was genuinely sorry and did offer to pay something towards a new one but if already planned to move away and it was a lot of hassle. I regularly back up my important files to various USB pens anyway, so I can't be too mad about it.
---
what'd you say when she wants you to come with her? This is the real problem here :D
---
Priest leveling is slow, but steady, and you are practically immortal. And the better your gear is, the more spells you can put into your leveling rotation, making killing mobs faster. At 35+ it was like holy fire - mind blast - swp - smite - finishing touches with wand. At the end you are with full HP and full MP and ready to kill again.

Well mace mh sword oh can be bis good example is early wotlk.
---
Depending on the real procc rate if + miras song/ hanzos will be preraid bis
---
Well I’ve been talking about classic wow since they announced it so she knows how important it is to me hehe
---
Does insurance not cover? American?
---
It did proc off one another. I experienced this first hand during vanilla. It was quickly patched away though.
---
I care alot about minmaxing. Im also planning on serieus raiding. Im a life long dps main.
---
- Do I like the fantacy?
---
- Do I like the toolkit/abilities?
---
- Would I look cool if I would make a pvp montage?
---
- Am I wanted in a serieus PvE envirement?
---
- Does the QoL pro's outweight the cons?
---
I Like wizards and magic. I like CC, kiting, escaping when needed, I can 1vX if needed, I'm toptier dps, this class has no cons.
---
I'm Brutallis and I'm an undead mage. Whats your game!
---
Well if the proc rate was high it would be.
---
I am also planning to play both the versions, mostly because I like the retail raids and I raid with a great bunch already. I see nothing wrong with it.
---
Flamestrike is great. You use in on the goblin packs in BWL and the bugs in AQ40
---
There's nothing like that feeling of catching up to someone you were chasing because of Carrot on a Stick.
---
I always thought that "I'm acting on instinct" was like a homage towards C&amp;C's song "Act on instinct", which is the first song you hear when you start up the campaign in C&amp;C
---
Wow, that was the most stupid thing I've ever heard :D
---
Gear doesnt really help you with ranking, neither does having hundreds of players for premades. What you need is a lot of free time to play and not many rankers on your server.
---
Rekdek was not shittalking pserver in general. He specifically said: " except for the small portion of the private server community" which means that most pserver people do not act like they know it and therefore are as curious as all others.   
---
Only a select few retards thinking they know it all - like Steppenwolf or the opposing faction thinking 15% proc rate is correct - remain certain that their precious pserver iteration is the one and only.
---
We all are very, very interested on what data Blizzard will dig up and if it indeed is 10% proc rate and if it's also the 0,4% droprate of IF.
---
No matter how hard the forum dwellers are crying, Blizzard won't give us a release date, until they are 100% sure.  
---
That's the blizzard I love...  they don't make promises they can't uphold.  it's done when its done.
---
Looking for an EU guild that raids on a GMT +3/+4 friendly schedule. Ideally ending at 23:00 GMT+3/+4
---
Please PM if you shit this schedule. I am British and only speak English (sorry Ruskis :( мои извинения братья ((( )
---
Why on earth would anyone want release day off?  Plagued with crashing
---
No there aren’t.
---
Is your raid threat-capped? Would that item raise threat? Are there better threat-increasing weapons in other available raids?
---
You need to know every single table and what classes get priority on them, otherwise you are exposed to corruption without even knowing.
---
&gt;Vis'Kag from Ony. Do you give that to a tank or melee first
---
Ok, you're screwed, don't join a LC guild.
---
Hmm  I wonder if the people who are going to be getting paid to play will have a lot of time....
---
Ironfoe + Thrash is not a great combo. You lose a lot of dps by using such a slow OH. 
---
Plus farming out Ironfoe is basically impossible for a Rogue. 
---
Thrash + Mirah’s Song is the way to go.
---
I'm thinking spraying myself in the face with pepper spray might be more fun than playing retail.
---
Just get a Druid for what could potentially be 500 runs?
---
https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm
---
mine knows too. she's pregnant and I hope classic release mid juli. If later I will not spend much time on it and focus more on our newborn :)  
---
she knows i'll take some time off work to play.
---
Ironfoe is a pretty hard one to get right. It's a super rare weapon and getting the proc rate of a super rare weapon isn't easy. People disagreing between a 4 or 6% proc chance of that item shouldn't be understood as private servers being completely off and you can't take anything from it. Especially when people start shit like "private servers are so easier armor values all wrong", they are wrong, they are higher than blizzlike.
---
Classic will be the gold sick retail needs.
---
As a rogue I hate Faerie Fire and it's bloody 1 minute duration
---
Wasn't he a warlock ?
---
implying a rogue will ever get ironfoe
---
Warrior is a class, Tank is a role. Warriors are not tanks and tanks are not warriors.
---
Some warriors with the right gear, talent and player aptitude can tank. Others can't.
---
Druids can also tank, but only with the right spec, gear, player.
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt;   {Alliance PvP}   {West Coast Semi-Hardcore}   {LC}**   
---
**What are our goals?**  
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We won't be chasing server firsts but we do intend to be among the top guilds on the server, and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.   
---
We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged. We plan to start premades when the first BG's are released.  
---
**Why should you join us?**  
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids  to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones.   
---
They will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.   
---
**Want to know more?**  
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly. We accept casuals and strictly PvP'ers.  
---
**Very much seeking out Hpally, Warlock, and Fury.**
---
Took vacation on 22.07! Blizz dkbt disapoint me with release datę!
---
Should add to the beginning "not caring about spelling, grammar, or consistency of posts."
---
Play at work like a real Orc.
---
The issue is you run oom way too fast.
---
So not good in BG, raids, world pvp.
---
Good for duels, dungeons, fine for leveling.

#&lt;Pertento&gt;
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun 20:00 - 24:00 CET (with Monday an extra raid day for progression)
---
Visit http://pertento.eu/ and/or join us on our Discord!

Do the 1.12 talents, especially for warriors (more threat by far), have an impact? And BiS Pvp weapons?
---
Idk how anyone takes the side that has fucking humans on it... like???
---
How does one go about LEARNING what classes gain priority?
---
Remember to stay hydrated
---
They went back and forth on who got the actual kill, but either way both classes are badass for their ability to do that
---
There are no easy to get weapons that are much better than Thrash. You’ll be using Thrash for a while when you hit 60.
---
This is all hypothetically. Trying to learn before classic.
---
While i agree with this post.
---
Unfortunately, most people who just "enjoy the game" will probably never reach 60
---
hahhahaha
---
I have hopes of rolling all shaman specs in classic. A little healing but mostly ele in raids (can be done!) and some enh/ele in pvp
---
Imagine even considering giving vis'kag to the fucking tank, nice way to get your guild disbanded in the first week, buddy.

Ironfoe will look great on my prot pally.

10/10 Shitpost. The meme this is mocking just a few posts above makes it even better.
---
Ive rushed 60 min maxed and premaded asap on several servers since nost, and ive quit during bwl patch every time. Its time for a change. I guess you just gotta find what you enjoy doing, i want to play mc through naxx but im obviously not trying in a way that suits me
---
Thanks for the advice will keep it in mind
---
Playing the game. Unfortunately there isn't a list for this subject.
---
I'll have to be exceptional then
---
Raid tanking is WAY easier than dungeons imo. In a dungeon you're often expected to keep tabs on 3,4 or 5 mobs. In a raid, it's 1 or 2 max. Plus you get hit much harder in raids so you get more rage and generally have a personal healer.
---
&gt;It was reserved for the guilds best priests (sometimes even multiple innervates on same guy) and used on cd on every fight. Now, on private servers its barely even mentioned.
---
Because on private servers the raid dps is much higher and the healers don't go OOM. I was surprised how quickly bosses die in raids, faster than 5mans.
---
Not if you're from Texas
---
But I'm not playing the game yet. That's why I'm asking. I'm hoping that leaders in private server guilds can shed some light on it.
---
You can have 6 druids. 1 goes deep resto for swiftmend and hots, rest goes moonglow and spams downranked HT and never go OOM.
---
Or have 2 hotting, one the tanks one the raid, rest are there for healing touch.
---
Maybe add the npc with his voice lines so the memorial is in classic but don’t add the quest as it actually impacts the gameplay. There’s no reason to be upset if blizzard makes an exception to no changes to keep a memorial to a dead kid if it doesn’t actually change gameplay. 
---
That being said, I think there have been quite a few memorials added to the game over the years and it would be a bit silly to only add one to classic, and also silly for them to feel obligated to recreate all of them.
---
Let's be real here... how many launches have you been through (if you play on high pop servers) ?
---
I have yet to see one launch that wasn't fecked up and basically made highly populated servers unplayable, the same will go for Classic WoW as people will want to try it and I highly doubt they will make enough server for the flood.
---
You can jump right into the Rexxar story mode if you didn’t want to play the normal campaign with Arthas and such. Like others have mentioned, it’s almost worth waiting for reforged if you were planning on playing it. Hopefully reforged comes out a little before WoW classic to get my warcraft mojo going.
---
You learn about itemization for that class.
---
I still hope
---
Yup. Funnily enough it was Ion who did prove it.
---
 Because if they gives us a date and then have to change it for some reason it will be a when bigger shitstorm.   
---
 Worth to note that I also want to see a release date.
---
hunters mark too, I am gonna miss COS
---
That's part of the experience around Blizzard launches! Hanging out with friends and waiting for servers to go live and see who manages to actually get in!
---
You would think next month, summer starts in only 67 days. Although I highly doubt it, fingers crossed for June release lol. I'm still gonna expect mid august.
---
What about that MP5 +Shadow damage belt in BWL. That's SPriest prio!
---
I heard that one private server actually had a 98% ironfoe proc rate.
---
These goddamn servers....

**&lt;For Fun&gt; - EU - Horde - PvP Server - Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET) 
---
You are not required to make both raid days every week. We respect that you will have commitments in real life and understand that comes first!
---
**Introduction**
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvP server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. This means we accept people of any class or spec, even if it’s considered sub-par. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.
---
**Expectations**
---
A casual and relaxed raid environment.
---
A friendly atmosphere both in and outside of raids.
---
Social events available for all guild members at any level (with prizes!).
---
An experienced and mature leadership team.
---
A “for fun” attitude to everything in the game. That is what games are for after all!

If u have questions, you can ask me directly. Battletag: Doomz#2808   Discord: Tuqqz#0377
---
naw i think i'd rather ddos blizz
---
But Reforged isnt due in another few months is it?
---
Take your vacation. WoW will be here when you get back.
---
I agree. However, I didn't want to desaturate it too much, because then it only works with the skills I picked - and I might have made a few mistakes, so better safe than sorry. If the sheet was just for me, I would probably Greyscale the ones I do not want.
---
You want your best geared mage to have the ignite. We used to start with rolling the combustions and everyone hard casting Pyroblast at intervals. Then you have the worst geared mage/s spam scorch
---
Cant wait for the opening event :) btw. Anyone remember how long after collecting all the materials it will take for the gates to open ?
---
I'll play both as well! For the Horde!
---
# me not that kind of orc!
---
*^(Actually I am, and I will.)*
---
Poke poke poke, is that all you can do ?!
---
Shaman please bro much appreciated ❤️
---
WoW had pretty much no problems the last 3 expansions, why would Classic be different?
---
Okay, fair enough
---
10/10 moment!
---
I knew what it was but it's still so satisfying to watch!
---
Very likely not by itself if it's not battle.net edition, but it should run using DOSBox. There's W2: Battle.net edition on GOG, which should work even without DosBOX https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_2_battlenet_edition
---
Taken on a private server.
---
A huge part of those 3% are gonna be feral/moonkin. Early on all the guilds ob my current server were looking for good druids but could barely get any resto druids or tryhard feral druids between the flood of cats.
---
Easy but boring. Personally I can't hack it leveling as a priest. The monotony does my head in.
---
Where is the: "Im going to take my time levelling and enjoy the game BUT i know what the correct path is to play my class efficient." ?
---
You shouldn't have anything to worry about! A lot of people here on the sub can seem intimidating but they are really just a small fraction of the eventual user base as everyone else has already said. There will be a ton of new players just like you out there.
---
If it helps any, I've gone through a lot of the guild recruitment posts on Discord and a lot of them are happy to take on new players and just having fun as a group. If your interest lie more in hardcore raiding and things of that nature you should still be more than fine as long as you read up on your class once you reach that point where it really matters (endgame). 
---
Dedication and sincerity is more important than any previous history with the game :)
---
I tried running it in Dosbox a while back, but the mouse scrolling is way to sensitive to be useful even at the lowest setting.
---
And its the BNE version i got. Is the GoG release updated for later OSes?
---
That's because there's often been min/max questions on this sub.
---
dont come to stormwind orphanage tomorrow
---
Help, I'm being oppressed!
---
The best thing about returning as Alliance in Classic is no more dusty a** orange camp city.
---
Glorious Ironforge, i can't wait to hang out at the bridge again.
---
Really? You gonna be that willfully ignorant? Or is the cognitive dissonance so strong in you that you cant admit it?
---
For literally months now there have been almost nothing but daily threads about Joanna's speedrunning routes.  Threads about which class levels the fastest.  Threads on which zones to avoid while leveling.  Threads about "why you shouldn't run 5 man dungeons while leveling because it isnt efficient".
---
Etc etc ad naseum.
---
The reason people post "take your time" posts like these is for two main reasons:
---
1) fair is fair.  If everyone is gonna flood the sub with posts about speedrunning its perfectly acceptable to do the opposite.
---
2) to subtly remind everyone that speedrunning only feeds into the cycle that caused blizzard to change wow for the worse.  To elaborate a little on this: think about all those guilds and players that from WOTLK onward chewed through content as fast as it was churned out.  And then complained that they had nothing to do?
---
2a) speedrunning a 15 year old game to reclaim sever firsts from an era gone by?  Sorry, noone gives a shit that some dedicated hardcore guild (now) that couldn't compete with top tier guilds 15 years ago, somehow managed to get 2019 world first kills on onyxia.  Sorry but using 15 years worth of knowledge distillation and strategies that were perfected over a decade ago does not equate to skill.  At best it's a display of good rote copying.
---
Relatable
---
What are you even talking about? Everyone knows that Classic was a game of nothing but imbalances, hell that's one of the main reasons people love it so much. "I'm not going to admit it's unblananced because that's what I'm gonna play"? Who's denying it? Plus, what are you getting at? That Blizzard should re-balance everything? People would fucking riot.
---
Shamans are notoriously hard to recruit. I'm a bit surprised it is actually that high because usually recruitment demand far outweighs availability.
---
So yeah if anyone wonders what to play: play resto shaman for free guild choice and instant raid spot.
---
They take it as gospel. It's pretty sad how mislead most of the pserver community is.
---
Yep, i remember getting the 3 set bonus on this and thinking "well this sucks" until i tried it in AV, HELLO finishing off those low HP fools that was retreating.
---
I don’t follow no. You are agreeing their values are off, which is why I don’t put much stock in them. Not sure what else there is on that topic? The rest seems like some people being mean to private server players, or private server players being elitist. Both happen, neither one matter. I play one myself, northdale, but I don’t think it makes sense to use that much to predict how classic will be. Remains to be seen to be sure tho.
---
not unfeasible, since you can gurantee them hoj. which most wars  run this dung for. 
---
usually ppl are happy to take someone who doesn't need hoj. since pretty much every person who does emp lava run goes for hoj, since there is nothing else worthy that drop.
---
Coming from an Aussie player playing on private servers with 350ms, it really isn’t an issue :) not to mention we will be using the newer client which runs heaps smoother than the 1.12 client

WoD was unplayable for a couple days on release at least in europe but I seem to remember they had server problems everywhere but yeah the last 2 were without trouble but I would expect some hiccups on classic release tbh.
---
that's a nice list  
---
I did add some cost/savings for myself for leveling so I know what spells I wanna buy and how often I should hit the trainer.  
---
here is a link if someone is interested  [https://imgur.com/a/3Uf0LFL](https://imgur.com/a/3Uf0LFL)
---
This is not true. It can affect people's gaming experience massively if their class/spec just isn't sought after or if the class they want to recruit isn't available.
---
Then you did it wrong

---
**Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place.Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
**What we expect of members:**
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids (once a week).
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot.
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done.[https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903)

I mean, I wouldn't be too shocked if I were you. Expect to see some tryhard guilds running 2-3 warrior tanks, 5 healers, and like 20+ dps warriors until AQ comes out.

Tired of r/classicwow to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!

Whatever your friends say "it be cool if you could heal us in this and that dungeon" you will hate the class before getting to 60.

Moderate | PvE on PvP server | Based in the UK | Horde 
---
**About us:** 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
**Our Goals:** 
---
\- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal. 
---
\- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
\- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
**Expectations:** 
---
\- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
\- Actually showing up! 
---
\- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
**Looking for:**
---
We will be showing preferences to melee DPS such as Arm/Fury Warriors, Rouges and also healers
---
**Schedule:** 
---
**-** We will be raiding two days a week
---
\- The specific days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
\- Time will be 7:00PM GMT and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. 
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game. Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: https://discord.gg/m2j9mgZ
---
I mean, yeah, they're gear dependant but so are all other classes(to some extent). Its not like they have to farm gnomeregan 24/7 for some low level weapon to do meaningful amount of dps. 
---
And yeah, you have to put time into your warrior to squeeze out the most damage, but again, its the same with other classes. Except for druids, shamans, pallies and hunters cause even if you spend all your life on them, a casual warrior with no hands will outdps you

FRIES, INSECT!
---
The lote and story of the Warcraft games is second to none. It truly does have one of the best stories of any game—period
---
For technical issues, im happy to wait, the smoother the launch the better.
---
For waiting just because Retail needs its new big patch out first, i will not.
---
Based on my experience, it's hard enough just to fill all the healers spots, so while I'd take several druids, we had to use restorative pots to down Lucifron because of lack of Priests.
---
Darnassus WAS dope, sadly no one visited it :(
---
The original system led to utter despair. He got there anyway. Never did a bg again.
---
Imagine not getting it to drop. You’d be so lucky.
---
"awww look at this little fellow stabbing me in my shins" 
---
Kill them with cuteness.
---
From memory after all turn is are done there is a week, then the gong becomes available. Idk if my memory is right though 😊
---
For me it's PvP! World PvP and Battlegrounds, I have hundreds of thousands of honourable kills on my toons.
---
Also, grinding materials, leveling professions, helping guildmates. Dungeons are not over "really quickly", for some classes it can take many many hours to get all of your best dungeon gear. Even more if you are trying to get Ironfoe. Sure for someone who plays 2000+ hours on the game, it's over "quickly"
---
Ideally you have 3 tanks with 100% attendance and a bunch if dps warriors that keep their tanking gear up to date.
---
For PVE at least, Alliance probably will have the most toxic people "Dwarfs only as Tanks and priests!"
---
One MT in our guild was farming lava runs for ironfoe and other one ubrs Rend runs for felstriker. amout of time, gold and runs that went into that was insane.
---
Its too early for McExecutus
---
Wowhead was great. When it started. Now it's so bogged down with ads and shit that it's ridiculous to use. It's horrible to interact with. The load time has almost quadrupled from back when it was JUST a website with ONE ad banner that EASILY supported the cost of the website. But no. They didn't stop there.
---
WoD was unplayable at launch because of a bug with garrisons, after getting in you were stuck inside so the increasing load of people finishing the intro made the instance servers crash.
---
There are some bugs that only "reveal themselves" after a certain threshold of load so they're very difficult to find before going live.
---
Something like could happen or not with Classic, we don't know.
---
But I know that more than a decade of playing MMOs taught me to *never* play on launch day, especially when I'd have to take time off work for it.
---
You do know that you are playing a MMORPG? You can group up and make new friends as you go.
---
I'm not stopping you, but I'm just putting this out here.
---
Well, playing a pally. Could spam flash heal until the end of times without real problems.
---
This feature may attract players to Classic who wouldn't otherwise play and be in the spirit of the original game, so no thank you.
---
Im sure if you would get a guild at launch, nobody is going to recruit mass number of druids for raiding anyways, since they know whats up at this point. You can get by with 3 very active druids and still have 1 sit out on most raids.
---
paladin equals warrior in horrible leveling. You basically autoattack to 60. Seal judge seal judge seal judge zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Damn, that’s nice! Thanks for the answer mate. 
---
I know it’s not the best option, but I personally value these things more than raw, sustained damage. I just find systems like these more fun to play with 
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Not having Victory Rush really kills warrior leveling in vanilla sadly, it's rough.
---
According to GoG forum there are actually two versions of the game: Classic and Enhanced. Enhanced is supposedly developed by GoG, but you have to use Classic for Battle.net.
---
Did your W2 not work on Win 10? It seems that what they call Classic is basically an unmodified W2: BNE and should work on Win 10 with this note:
---
&gt;Users running older versions of Windows 10 Redstone may experience a crash on launch when running the game’s executable. Patching your operating system to the newest version (Redstone 5) should correct this issue.
---
So maybe it would be worth trying it again. I'm very tempted to try it on my PC today, I run Win 8.1 though but I'll let you know if it works.
---
thank you!, this is very useful :)
---
You and me both, brother. You and me both. I've got a MGC of over 150 people all awaiting Pantheon, but only about 30 of us are going to be playing WoW classic.
---
Nowhere near the insane amount I wanted, but hey, at least when Pantheon comes out, we'll all play the game we've been waiting half a decade for in reality, and fifteen years for in actuality.
---
Gimme a heal* yeah!
---
Some casuals. there are toxic people on both sides.
---
And don't label casuals as people who don't know how to play the game.
---
Casuals are the heart and soul of WoW.
---
If you know your class, and have Thistle Tea, you can basically kill everyone with 31/8/12 and preraid BiS. Source: had a rogue in 1.12, killed tier 2 sulfuras warriors if I had most of my cooldowns.
---
Important to mention that back then there were a huge amount of noobs. If you'd meet a t2 warri now, I'd assume he has the skills to melt me completely. Nevertheless, rogue pvp is always super viable, fun, and op in vanilla (especially against clothies).
---
WoD wasn't unplayable, just the garrisons for the first day. 
---
It was only unplayable insofar that it was shit.
---
When you get far enough into the game you pretty much just know where things should go. There's some overlap but it wouldn't be hard to know most of it. A good guild is going to have a few people of different classes/different kinds of expertise to be able to talk about it.
---
It'd be really hard to go into depth on all the details (and I'm waaaaay to far out of practice given I haven't played since TBC and always used some form of DKP) but the basic concept would be what would be the biggest gain for raid progression. I don't know what changes there have been to theory crafting since I played, but for your example of Vis'kag, it would go to a DPS most likely (from what I remember). Protection warriors don't benefit from slow weapons very much (IIRC not at all actually), and there are no good tanking stats on it.
---
There are plenty of items that are more in between and would be great in more than one spot, and in that case you'd give it to tanks who would really benefit up to the point where you stop needing the best geared tanks, then to the DPS that would benefit the most/would have that as the best item they could get in the slot.
---
Thank you sir.
---
Is it considered a spell? I didn't know this
---
I used to have this on my Holy Paladin, and would regularly find people's alts logging in to inform me that I'd been reported for hacking, after an attempted failed ganking.
---
To paraphrase: "Paladins can't Vanish, you cheating \*\*\*\*!"
---
Thank you. Yeah, I heard that a lot. I'm looking forward to it :-)
---
I think hes saying, thats gotta be like your best friend that he does the required number of runs for you. When he doesnt really get anything off that instance.
---
Most healers work the same way: they don't go oom if they use their efficient heals but their high burst heals are highly inefficient with really high costs. Sometimes you have to spam that. Hardcore raids have warriors dual-wielding in fury spec for maximum threat generation. You have to spam high rank heals there. But at that point the boss dies so quickly that you still won't go OOM.
---
It was back then. Sadly when TBC rolled around, that particular combo was slammed with the nerf bat. The Proc was changed to a flat haste buff, too.
---
Get another druid then.
---
why wouldnt you mainhand trash blade? until rend swords that is
---
DIE, BURGER KING!
---
As a kid I kept replaying Rexxars campaign, I didn't even finish wc3, but that campaign I must have done a dusin times. 
---
I remember looking for Rexxar I wow, but never found him back then, probably cuz I played Alliance.
---
Story? Absolutely the best.
---
Lore? Errm.. not so much when there are LotR and Warhammer 40k.
---
Same thing here, rewatching with the wife! First time I completely missed the buildup of the boltons betrayal... pretty cool to see all those intricate plots being layed down the 2th time around.
---
Yet despite this claimed high attrition rate, they are still 25% of the raiding population in one class.
---
Obviously it's not hard enough to actually deter people.
---
I am quite set on druid. And the wheel rolled druid on first try :D guess it works.
---
Ahh man it's good to see people mention stuff I totally forgot. I was going to comment that I raided with plenty of arms specced warriors, but the next part of that sentence would be "through early AQ" which was patch 1.9, and then I rerolled when the guild fell apart in AQ and don't remember what specs people played after that.
---
(That said, I think I probably had several MS specced warriors in Naxx, but I can't remember well enough to say anything specific).
---
Then (December 2004): 11 years old. Sneaking out of my room past my bedtime to play my Troll Shaman that didn't hit 60 until 2006.
---
Now: 25 years old. Refreshing Reddit daily at my 8-4 job @ an IT Solutions company - hoping one of you leak a release date so I can start planning my life accordingly around Classic.
---
There's nothing else to do to progress at 60 once you have a set of dungeon blues. Except PvP, where you will get wrecked by raiders.
---
It's only one aspect of the game, but it's the aspect where all the endgame content and all the best gear is. That makes it a pretty bloody important aspect, and pretty bloody problematic that it is optimal to have one class hogging 25% of the raid slots.
---
And here I am thinking, "Where the fuck is the middleground between casual and hardcore? Because I'm ALWAYS that guy. But my kind of people aren't represented here. Where's the 'semi-hardcore' or 'serious' raiding guild?"
---
how can porn be nsfw when people are paid to make it
---
Pretty much vanilla levelling in a nutshell tbh
---
No wonder alliance are slackin behind in raids, they are still bringing more than 1 warrior into raid
---
have to mention that if you have any big ass slow 2hander, hand of justice, and you are an enhancement shaman, it is the same thing basically.
---
Don't do it don't get ironfoe that weapon is a curse. You will not get an upgrade especially as a human until naxx.
---
Oh god he's a ret paladin.
---
Not to mention the rarity of hand of justice.  
---
Furthermore I'd say good luck on finding a 5 man that makes it through the fire keeper gauntlet room or even wants to do emp runs...
---
Back in the day most people didnt want to go that way, at least from my experience...
---
there should be a second role-playing category for guilds that have scheduled RP events, occasionaly do ad-hoc RP stuff, but are not always IC
---
Yeah, absolutely. I also heard that no private server has actually implemented mob armor. Those poor souls have been fighting armorless mobs for the past ten years and think they have a chance of clearing Molten Core in Classic...
---
If you’re trying to *Speedrun* Skip WW Axe. It’ll probably take you too long to find people to do the quest at 30, let alone farm the materials. If you want a better leveling experience, get WW Axe.
---
Can you disclose if you have actually played the game now or are just remembering 2004-2006?
---
If you pug raids, go with gold-bids. Problem is solved.
---
Yep, watch that interview with the Nost Dev and how he said most of their information was made up from watching 240p videos from YouTube and trying to recreate it.
---
Does this work in classic?
---
Yeah in Vanilla he patrolled from the northern parts of Feralas and thru Desolace up to Stonetalon mountains.
---
I dont know why people argue about stuff like this like I was there I tried to level for two days and it was impossible the servers were lagging like hell here is a blue post: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/15271097043
---
I don’t get it
---
Gentlemen, gentlemen, you have raised some good points as to what spells are the memiest, however I am going to have to say screw your meme spells and stop you right there. Make way for the real meme spell.
---
Swirly ball.
---
Loktar Ogar !

I want to try horde this time after playing gnome warrior in vanilla. I'm wondering who you think has the best racial for a horde warrior in WSG and also in world pvp 1v1? I'm thinking orc or undead, but I do remember some cows being good with that stomp stun.
---
Let's hope so!
---
What I want to know, is why after 15 years have the Gnomes still not reclaimed Gnomeregan. I vaguely recall something in Wrath/Cata? where we recaptured the city with Mekkatorque. What happened then? Why isn't Gnomer a capital city now?
---
You better heal your allies who get destroyed by hunters with the ZG trinket throwing double multishots into the group.
---
GLAMORAMA (Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!
---
Classic is coming! We are already over 30 people but still recruiting all classes!
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to clear all raid content, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
Our background:
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
What we offer:
---
- Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
- Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
- Balanced raid groups
---
- For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
What we require of raiders:
---
- Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
- Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We strongly believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be “geared and cleared” of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
Loot rules: We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing
---
We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord https://discord.gg/92V5CCD , send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.
---
Sincerely,
---
Glamorama
---
Hardcore raiding:
---
&gt;For the learning phase, expect the raiding week to be an entire week with any downtime spent farming materials and crafting consumables. 
---
I think underestimate the time frames involved here. The actual REAL resistance consumables demand start in AQ/NAXX. Where its absolutely required to have the consumables in certain fights. You have like a YEAR to slowly collect materials, consumables etc for the raids. It doesnt require playing all day every day. Play a hour, make 20-30g stock up. Dont wait until the instance is going to get released next week (well, if you have couple thousand gold to spend, thats going to work too).
---
You can currently very easily setup a test server and show ppl how to do the tactics, without spending a silver on anything. Loads of people have 15 years of experience. They know what to do, what works and what doesnt. Very few guilds that really aim for example server firsts WONT do test runs, optimize their pulls and making sure everyone knows every fight.
---
I always used to refer to the bubble+HS combo as "Improved Vanish".
---
I love me some voluptious female tauren booty
---
Any advice for warrior professions to make $$$?  For leveling cant decide between tailoring/skinning/herbalism/etc ? Im going to grab engineering after 60, whats the best to pair with that?
---
For Druid you’ll Need to do it as it’s class quests that will provide you bear form...
---
That’s why you got to get 4 friends. 
---
It’s basically the hardest part of WoW. Playing WoW and having friends.
---
Must be better combos than the HS for such a proc?
---
why anyone would willingly group and fight alongside gnomes instead of kill them is beyond me. disgusting litlle creatures deserve nothing but a painful death by my axe
---
At least you can vanish mark in 1.12
---
so are worth it, some aren't. 
---
like druid bear form quest you need to do. poison quest you can skip.
---
aquatic form is more questionable, personally i would do it, but not at level when you get it, but when you'd be around these places anyways and its more convienient. aquatic form can be very useful later for some water quests and movement.
---
warrior got some key quests like stance quests, but at the same time a ton of armor reward quests which most of which aren't efficient to do as far as i  know.
---
Interesting, I heard that it was actually a 72p video and the Nost guy who was watching it is a nearsighted Alzheimer patient. That might explain why no private server to date managed to implement mob damage. It's really funny how people who have spent all those years fighting mobs that don't deal damage think that they can clear Deadmines in Classic.
---
Lvl 40 when the game actually starts for a warrior as you get finally to the Mortal Strike/Bloodthirst.
---
1v1 PVP as a horde character who is better? mage or warlock?
---
I hope not
---
It was an Illidan’s quote😜
---
Think of the reactions from people who don’t know about it though? Sounds like a great combo to me haha
---
Obviously they wouldn't replace peacebloom with something like that.
---
I absolutely love the fact that the South Park episode brought you in.
---
Alliance and Horde had different items and different amounts it's pretty easy to reshuffle these between the faction, and ofc they can implement weekly caps which means that the turn ins that are counted towards progressing the war effort can have a weekly cap to ensure that the event lasts for at least X weeks.
---
You can also go one step forward and simply tag all the items that were gathered before the pre-War Effort event e.g. when they introduced the elemental invasions and the cultists as non useable they can add some BS lore explanation like no silithid essence or some nonsense like that.
---
That said I don't think they'll do it unless they'll see people actually hoarding stuff, I don't think that as many people will horde stuff as you think, the private server community is an oddity. 
---
If Classic will have a wide appeal and wouldn't be as try hard top heavy as the private server community it wouldn't matter as much.
---
As far as balancing things go for the greater good this is by far the easiest thing to tweak for their systems designers.
---
Even if it didn't work, shaman astral recall should.
---
Most fun would be if they said they would change it and then did not
---
Nah, it's mainly a paladin thing. Their Flash heal is bugged in vanilla, it has 100% scaling from +healing. So, when you can get a decent amount of bonus healing you can spam rank 1 flash heal, which is basically free, forever and have a decent healing output.
---
Can’t wait to do it again in reforged.
---
Im healing one of those dualwielding tanks that do deathwish at pull. Im only using max rank heals. Why would i use somthing else ? But as a pally i only have two options. Flash heal works great when theres constant healing incoming, just do the big heal on timed boss attacks where the tank goes low. NP.
---
Using 12 healers keeping the tanks up isnt really a issue. Just need to spam heal them. Doesnt really matter if its flash heal or holy light. Holy light results in more overhealing overall, since most of the time tank is at full hp. Cba to stop casts when i dont have to worry about mana.
---
Pally doesnt have "high burst" heal, its big slow heal or constant spam that you can do for ever.
---
I have Ice Block bind on CapsLock so i always push it twice and return to normal😜
---
old blizzard standards are the best kind
---
With warriors or rogues being so desirable, for example, you also will be in a disadvantage, because there is an enormous amount of rogues and warriors (prior to census data from any private servers). Your only proper safe choice is to roll a priest or a paladin for that.
---
Stonetalon for sure, as it's one of the first zones horde will find themselves ganked in, AND, the run to the graveyard is always so so long
---
You punt the gnome and eat the cake.
---
Yeah that’s pretty much why i’m not interested in the max grind. 
---
Would be cool to have but not worth ruining the game enjoyment for me. Interesting story though.
---
While this is true in any 5-15 man it is not the same in 40 man the only extra you bring is slightly better wf totems and extra mana/time to totem twist
---
Smite does not trigger the auto target thing IIRC.
---
Pretty much. Hunters are the biggest noob magnet in the game along with rogues, and over half of players I met on Pservers, even though we're in 2019, are backpeddlers/clickers. Good hunters (basically people who know how to play their class properly, not even great players) are rather rare.
---
But you have to place the SS on someone before you start combat - you cant use it as a BR like druids can. So if you SS your tank and your healer dies (or vv) it wont help you.
---
📜 **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU Alliance** guild that intends to roll on a **PvP** server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
***What to expect***
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
📌 We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server, but we don't plan to raid on it, as it is just there for us to jump on and have some fun now and then, and also test out the classes and make our final decisions until launch.
---
We are currently accepting Raid Leader applications!
---
⚠️ **Raid dates:** Thursday --&gt; Tuesday
---
**Raid times:** 7:50 PM GMT
---

---
Indeed! I wish they would release it before Classic to get me in the mood.
---
A lot of the procs were changed because they would scale terribly and could lead to quite a lot of exploits of various abilities.
---
Same goes for all flat stats, you can't have a level 58 trinket being BIS at level 70 still...
---
Private server bosses are beefier than they were in Vanilla. Armor values are way overtuned to curb the melee dps. If Blizzard truly sticks to nochanges then I’m confident that Classic raiding will be significantly easier than private servers.
---
You wot m8 dwarf is master race you uncultured swine.
---
Enhancement is good early game when ppl have low hp. And dropp of fast as ppl get better gear but you can always switch to elemental/resto
---
Same
---
Awesome video, thx for sharing +1
---
Yeah, at least there is that, I'm far from a rogue pro but I usually feel like I'm a day late and a dollar short on most of my pserver rogues
---
Better questions. Are you for or against oppression?
---
I don't want to be rude, but you don't know what you're talking about. I heard from a trustworthy source that private servers never managed to make player abilities cost resources. With this in mind, I seriously doubt that private server players will be able to kill Hogger.
---
It will be out when it comes out.
---
Some yes some not.
---
Wasn't there also an item that gave you a low chance to self-rez after being killed? Dunno the name though.
---
My WOD guild was like this, they even made up their own language and expected people to macro it. It's of gratz it was sal'liendore or some stupid shit. Made no sense we were Horde but talked like elves, I got muted too many times for just saying grats and hauled ass.
---
Can't be warlocks.
---
I have 26 days of vacation leave this year. 
---
That I'll be taking for vanilla shenanigans.
---
What's preventing you from planning your vacation?? I'll have mine in August when I'm sure that the game will be out.
---
I’m looking for a casual guild on EU-PVP-Alliance. Seems like all the guilds advertised here have moderate to very high expectations, even those thay say they are “casual”.
---
I might play 30 hours one week, and 2 hours the next. I don ‘t need another girlfriend to nag me into what to do. I’m looking for some ppl to hang with and help eachother and just fool around in Azeroth, no strings attatched.
---
If you're speedrunning, then DO get WWA, but at about L42. I asked the fastest warrior to 60 on a certain server and they did exactly that.
---
they themselfs don't know the release date. do you seriously think they know the date, but purposely don't say it to make you to annoy their players? 
---
As soon as they settle on the date, they announce it.
---
There you have it.
---
People WILL be account sharing, thats for sure. They gonna do it to achieve world/realm first 60 and to get r14 in pvp.
---
Well obviously you have to do the Druid class quests. 
---
And for Warrior the stance quests. Also I believe there’s a quest that gives you your first green sword around level 10. Might be part of the stance quest but you should do it anyway.

Who we are: &lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual. We are serious about clearing content but can’t dedicated our lives to playing all day any more. We want people who are serious, on time, and want to clear content in a timely manner. This means when we raid at a certain time we are all in the raid at that time. Not all logging on at the time.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. For three hours a night. For loot we run Loot Council. We prioritize giving loot to people who are actively trying to help the guild. This includes showing up to raids on time, attend raids regularly, help other guild members to get them raid ready, contribute items to the guild, listen to directions, etc.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. We’ve got open spots for every role except for Prot Warriors. You can check what we are looking for on our website linked below.
---
If you have any questions you can message me on discord @ frail_#3482
---
You can find our app at: https://boaf.enjin.com/ or https://discord.gg/6yGcSF
---
Yes massa
---
can we compare it with the class numbers at lv60 on pservers?
---
Priests are pretty good lvlers. They only suffer from no movementspeed and no multi mob targeting, but beyond druids, hunters and warlocks, they're among the fastes.
---
It's the plague of modern MMORPGs, happens on mobile and PC MMOs
---
But there is something worse, daily/weekly/monthly quests/rewards
---
I don't want rewards for logging in every day, I want rewards for slaying dragons, that shit is so immersion breaking
---
And people who don't want to raid.
---
I would much rather just lay out a weapon progression from quests that are fairly easy to do.
---
Imperium LF class Leaders, officers and a raid lead. More info soon!

Just done this chain on a pserver. Was such a fun moment. 
---
It’s hard to beat a shaman for that Warcraft flavour.
---
Warrior tank BiS?
---
This works on private servers. It should work in Classic as well.
---
Can’t cast it while in combat.
---
Of course. But it’s just some fun.
---
Some campaigns are less than stellar missionwise, but imo you should still play all of them to experience the full story. Orc/rexxar TFT campaign is separate and a wow prelude as opposed to a strategy game proper.
---
If I remember correctly, reign of chaos undead campaign was a bit meh, and in frozen throne undead campaign was the better one.
---
Employers need some notice to permit long vacation.
---
How can you justify not being able to Mind Control people off of cliffs, though?

hahahaha. well done.

Don't:.  The ones that slow you down.
---
Something like that right?
---
Pretty sure a Troll Rogue would decimate you with throwing knife skill alone. 🙄
---
not a cheat. If it looks like a boar, sounds like a boar, is named like a boar and dies like a boar.
---
It is a boar. What else?
---
thanks I put in some effort haha
---
why are the top pics not the same area in org tho. this bothers me :o
---
Had a NE friend who could probably heal the vast majority of players under the table. 
---
The player &gt; the race. All day every day.
---
Just got this from the trash in BWL on my shaman yesterday (on retail). Damn i got nostalgic for a moment there haha.
---
Yeah if you can get it
---
/equip Carrot on a stick
---
/cast Swift Palomino
---
&gt; i legit thought some random psycho had walked into our house
---
LMAO
---
This comment made me laugh way more than it should have..
---
It's amazing watch this guy youtube stream his guild clearing Naxx in 1 hour 40 minutes.
---
There are some fucking delusional people on Nost that actually think they're going to easily achive Rank 13 and having end game content on farm easily. 
---
There are the same people that are stacking World Buffs with consumables to clear BWL.
---
I fucking laughed for weeks when people reported the Warlock pet bug on Classic Demo only for a Blizz Dev to say "no actually, that's how it was on Pservers...this is how it actually is"
---
Yeah those definitely. But streamers can't because there will be evidence on the net.
---
\*cough\* Diablo 3 \*cough\*
---
its mainly a lot more consumable use
---
same for all classes
---
Cuz op was talking about wie ging to have if and Trash blade^^
---
But yeah you have to be verry lucky to get IF as a rogue
---
Sorry if im just stupid but what are these horrible memories? I only ever used it for information for a quest or an item and it usually did the job well enough.
---
I can't really talk about paladins, I'm only familiar with druid healing and bit of priest one. For druids down ranked HT is really efficient but weak, high rank one is slow to cast inneficient but heals a lot, Regrowth heal a lot as well with a quick cast but REALLY inneficient.
---
&gt; Plus hunters get geared quick 
---
dont they compete with wars and rogues a lot? and competing with wars is bad cuz some will  be tanks and avoid inviting competition as much as they can
---
This is the most sad comparison i've seen... BRAVO
---
This guy thinks he’s getting Ironfoe. GL buddy.
---
Yeah. I thinks it’s an obvious choice. They don’t want to see classic fizzle and die. BC Classic will spark interest and keep us chasing that pink dragon
---
 \*cough\* ^(Diablo 3) \*cough\*
---
Why? Private servers are way more accurate than Classic will be.
---
BREAKING NEWS CLASSIC HITS OVER 20MILLION SUBS.

You forgot, don't be a bossy prick on forums.   😜

rogue war in tbc gets real good but late game in sunwell
---
https://wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
Go plan your vacation.
---
Jesus christ fucking calm yourself 😂😂
---
Yes! So many of the achievements have no purpose other than to be a treadmill. 
---
It Madden's me the people who feel like "well I'd never jump of cliffs without achievements so Blizzard must be doing a good job." 
---
I'm like "there's no reward you idiot!". Of course I don't call them an idiot but that's how I feel about it. 
---
And then if they do put rewards like silly mounts or weapon skins? Great. Now instead of developing real content they are just wasting people's time for what amounts to sand when by now we should be able to play as any of the following:
---
- Pig people.  (Like the Tauren starting zone ones.).   
---
- Murlocs.      
---
- Naga.     
---
- Kobolds.      
---
- Pearlfin Jinyu
---
Nah man, I'll be like, hey Google!   Set countdown to classic!
---
Engineering you absolutely need to pair with mining. Your best options for moneymaking while levelling are probably skinning and mining but bear in mind there may very well be a glut of low level supplies at launch so they won't be worth much
---
No what people did was boosting instances, we did not mob tag and leave and grab the xp and got invited back. that was not allowed
---
&gt; But raiding is only one aspect of the game
---
so u go pvp then and guess what the best pvpers tend to be raiders cuz tier sets are very good
---
hell some classes like warlocks have much more use from tier sets for pvp than pve so to get good scaling out of SL build u want to raid first lol
---
Im calm  ..LOL
---
He is obviously trolling and so am I.  
---
You should be the one to calm down, and back of xD XD
---
&gt;Doesn't really get anything off that instance
---
Smoking Heart of the Mountain. Sure it's easier to get than an Ironfoe on average but you'll be looking at a fair few runs to get the mats and recipe yourself, unless you want to get them off the AH, but people are going to know this time around how much Druids want that trinket, and will adjust prices accordingly.

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**

I've raided "hardcore" for over 8 years in World of Warcraft in different guilds around the world 50 ranks between tier5 and t15. I haven't raided in classic because i started a few weeks before TBC came out but people seem to have a scuffed view how "hardcore" guilds operate/function.
---
I've seen this sentiment all over this sub in different threads but i feel i need to say this:
---
Hardcore raiders are not robots that put in unimaginable hours into wow because all they do is raid, farm and eat and sleep.
---
Im gonna be bold and say that your typical hardcore raider will probably spend less time each week in raids than semi-hardcore or semi-casual raider with their main character.
---
The busiest ahardcore raider will be is probably the level time and the time until they have pre bis gear. 
---
Im used to raid 5-6 days a week with over 8h a day while progress. Im sure this will not be the case in vanilla. Good guilds will probably raid twice maybe three times a week and then they have all the time in the world for all the other activities.
---
Druid somewhere ? :)
---
I'd add
---
Tunic of westfall (defias chest as well if you are lucky)
---
Warbear harness
---
to this list
---
&gt;Sunken Temple Quest Rewards
---
Those were added in 1.10 and really distrupt itemization. Chest is BiS and stronger than most low-tier raid stuff.
---
I would go with life steal for some nice healing
---
&gt;Why isn't Gnomer a capital city now?
---
Because the horde trolls don't have a capital city.
---
I have the same worries as you.
---
My Mac Book Air can run Pserver just fine but I tried to download BFA and it doesn't work
---
I’m not trolling. I just worship the truth. Classic will be a complete shitshow compared to modern private servers which are basically a carbon copy or Vanilla.
---
you're not reading the full post.
---
&gt;and while you could place f-fire and reckless on the same target you only got the anti escape/fear mechanic onto the npc with it not any additional armor pen)
---
the minor reduction was an option (from f-fire or recklessness) and the major one (sunder or expose) as skilled expose made application of further sunders impossible (a stronger effect is already active)
---
 faire fire and recklessness can be active on a target. but they never reduced the armor twice. Recklessness can always be placed for its anti flee mechanic. The tests for this were done excessively throughout aq40 by for the horde, affenjungs, jade falcons, fate and path of glory and this research fed into the creation of the world first 1000 dps video at patchwork
---
Portugal anyone?
---
Yeah that wont be enough, and they do that in MC anyway. Imagine if Dire Maul is not out yet. They will need to take onyxia neck over trinket,  onslaught, strikers mark, Quick Strike Ring + Weapon.   
---
And thats just stupid, just so warlocks can do threat.  
---
What will happen is Guilds wont let warlock push dps/threat. no matter how much you want to do crazy damage. it wont matter. its just not a good idea, stacking damage for the class that has threat issues, without corruption and shadowpriest already.
---
Are u Zalgradis? xD
---
This comment chain has been quite the ride.
---
Well done.
---
My guild in retail vanilla broke up on the Nef fight.  It was almost always the shaman call that would wipe us, though I also remember having a lot of issues with the constructs getting loose at 20%.  We had a really hard time controlling them properly.
---
Awesome! What town and street do you live in? We should have a LAN party.
---
The only breath that sucks is Time Lapse, everything else is pretty simple.
---
" I heard from a trustworthy source that private servers never managed to make player abilities cost resources. "
---
Your reliable source is wrong. Just go play on diff private servers and you'd see how wrong that is.
---
Thanks for saying it. I’ve been waiting 7 years for people to quit paying for mediocre games. I feel like good gaming is about to make a revolution - assuming we finally begin by being smart consumers...
---
Because they want to make sure they can deliver a quality product on the date they said. I'm sure everyone sympathises with the frustration, I know I do, but it's better to wait then have WoD 2.0 on launch day
---
its a known fact that private server numbers are off and wrong from Vanilla.  
---
So either you are unaware and spreading lies.  
---
Or you are a troll.
---
Every damaging skill does.
---
The hunter only have to send his pet and/or hunter's mark you.
---
Fuck Alliance  
---
For the HORDE !  
---
 *Lok*\-*tar ogar*!
---
What do op have to backup his?
---
it both is and isn't the obvious choice..  
---
let's say they move all the classic servers to tbc.. then you'll just have people clamoring for vanilla again.. the fight that was just won will start again. same happens with the argument for wow2
---
let's say they move half the servers to tbc and keep the other half as classic forever.. then what if you rolled on the "wrong server" for what you want to play. do they offer server transfers? doesn't that ruin the server communities? or risk further faction imbalance on servers?
---
what if they do nothing and keep the servers at 1.13 forever.. and naxx has been out for over a year.. and people are in full t3 and have 20k gold and everyone and their dog is rank 14.  the barrier for entry for new players, esp on a PVP server will be incredibly high and near impossible for some.  if people get bored and leave, that will kill wow classic.
---
if they release new servers every so often, that risks some servers becoming ghost towns in population and the need to server merges and such.. again killing communities.
---
there is no perfect answer for sure they all have their pros and cons. we will have to wait and see what blizz does but I don't think it's clear cut answer as whatever they choose will upset a portion of the player base.
---
I booked my vacation already.  But I'm going to the beach.   Wow classic ain't going nowhere.  If it goes live before it after, I'll make it work.
---
You know, like an adult.   Instead of begging toy makers to let me know when the toy will be ready!
---
Install an energy timer and go to prowl.
---
Once you are at 100 energy, wait for the timer to almost go off.
---
Then use this ability and gain it's power for a few abilities, increasing your burst potential.
---
I was a super casual in vanilla. I made contributions but had no idea what it is was for. My surprise when I’m a veteran of the game and remember the good days when dungeons weren’t cake walks. Also nobody told me getting a mount at 40 was hard. My try hard warlock friend couldn’t believe me when I bought a mount at 40 rolling warrior
---
and thanks to streamers we know that plenty of p-server guilds can't get shit done without said world buff stacking. So how are they 'better' with that in mind?
---
Those are no minor buffs. 18% spell crit 10 % physical crit 340 attack power 15% all stats (30 % of that stamina)  
---
If they can't kill bosses without that they need to carry a lot of dead weight around with their raid
---
You could make a table comparison with class at level 60.  
---
For example there is approx 12.5% Paladin in a R25 (5/40).  
---
But 10% of the Alliance at level 60 is Paladin.  
---
As 10%&lt;12.5%, this means paladin is a "high demand" class at level 60, so you will be able to find a raid spot easily.
---
30
---
Whirlwind
---
If you type “allyourbasearebelongtous” into the chat pane while playing the first mission, it should give you an instant win and let you proceed to mission 2
---
It’s the icon for “Need”, aka they need /roll on every item?
---
Not sure lol, fucking cryptic joke.
---
Game is realeasing in it's 1.12 state. It won't happen.
---
wasn't the droprate of the venom sacks like - worse than some world drop legendaries? ;)
---
I don’t think it would be wrong to see it come back, or at least some point in classics lifecycle.
---
Yeah, i meant that even if you want something, you are looking at FAR less runs (overall). Have to be a great friend to run BRD 500 just to help someone out. But hey, ironfoe might drop on the first run... or 2nd...
---
there isnt enough loot to gear 20 tryhard dps wars
---
No changes! Go alliance. (Posted by Orc warrior)
---
&gt; The player &gt; the race. All day every day.
---
Unless you need fear ward
---
&gt;How can anyone plan their vacation?
---
By quitting your job 😎 Epic gamer style
---
This has been asked so many times. Classic will be run on the Legion engine. Download BFA and see if you lag, it will be a decent estimate.
---
10+ years ago is still 'fresh' in your memory? Your brain must be amazing
---
for 9/10 guilds the main problem  will be filling the raid
---
FF(F) is the best pull a tank can ever have, since it's instanct cast with no travel time and has zero cost, with low CD. It also produces a substantial amount of threat, making it possible to range tank a mob and keep it off of a healer.
---
That is the most valuable utility spell a bear tank has.
---
So? I know that was the original reason (since Gnomer was originally built as a city) but who cares about balancing shit like this?
---
I"ll probably try to play the AH on retail so I can get some gold to buy some gametime tokens to play classic.
---
Hand of Justice + Seal of Command + Grand Marshal's Claymore was my favourate combo :3
---
Imp Expose armor is the best thing in the game how dare you bash it. As a warrior main in our raiding guild we get to 5 sunders asap only to have it over ridden by ea once I see that debuff it means no more needing to sunder unless it falls off but rogues can keep it up most of the time.
---
yes plus the dps wars that will run it as tanks and reserve it
---
1: "I hear that one ps actually...."
---
2:  "They take it as gospel..."
---
3: "Yeah, absolutely I also heard.... Those poor souls have.."
---
Looks like they are the only one taking hearsay as gospel.
---
Yeah, people are so desperate to create classic memes in this sub that they are not even bothering with making sense.
---
People are arguing with you because you suggested release day would be a crash-fest. I didn't play WoD - but Cata, Legion and BFA were all perfectly fine.
---
They're arguing with you because your statement is almost certainly wrong.
---
The problem is complex and no one knows the correct choice. If you make too many different versions of the game the playerbase will be split too much and some versions will feel like ded games.
---
In 1v1 maybe.
---
If hes battle healing, he is probably more important to his group then you are to yours.
---
Oops, forgot about that. Me total noob.
---
Then (2005-2007): 15-17 casual. Warrior to 50. Druid to 48. First max was 70 enh shaman. Friend loved wow more than me. Got addicted and dropped out of high school. I was still close to his family but it seemed he didn’t want to hang out with me anymore because I went on to college, study abroad, career. 
---
Now: miss my lifetime best friend. Happy with my irl level but I know relationships are the most important thing in my life. Reached out to him a few times in the last year. No response. Still happy but classic can have bittersweet memories.
---
I'm talking about shit like BoA, not ony neck. I don't mean literally all out to the point of insanity.
---
You should stop talking before you embarrass yourself any further. I bet you don't even know that there's not a single private server where every item doesn't have a 100% drop rate. If private server players manage to progress past Thistle Boar, I'll eat my Vanilla server blade.
---
Me not that kind of orc.
---
Pallys are very odd in that sense that their fastest heal is super efficient. In levelup i couldnt believe that the faster heal was more mana efficient than the slower heal.
---
Rank 1 holy light, 35 mana, 2.5s cast, heals for 39-48
---
Rank 1 Flash of light, 35 mana, 1.5s cast, heals for 62-73
---
Obviously you get flash of light on later level, but still, exact same mana usage, half the heal with 1s longer cast. Fucking nuts.
---
The numbers are slightly beefed up so the content isn’t completely trivial, but to call them wrong is just perverse.
---
That’s correct. You won’t be good on a competitive level. But you can be mid dps in a casual experienced raiding guild if you work harder than everyone at grinding consumes. Elementals main downside is mana efficiency but if you can supplement that you can hang in there for sure
---
For my druid it would have to be Tranquility.  The spell effect was neat and the idea of a long cooldown potentially clutch aoe healing ability is a good one, but it only heals group members within range and not really for very much.  I don't recall it scaling off of +healing very well either so it didn't really improve much with gear, you'd probably heal more just throwing a downranked Rejuvenation on each of your party members.  A 10 minute cooldown ability should definitely be better than this.
---
Join the free. The Forsaken and serve Queen Sylvanas.
---
Im picking paladin cuz JUSTICE. Idc if they're good or bad, im gonna apply buffs to the raid and kill myself so I can bubble a priest to rez the raid.
---
One of my favorite wow vids ever
---
Don't forget about using it for instacapping flags in AB :&gt;
---
Vanilla had more alliance than horde.
---
Personally I’m going Horde.
---
Bullets from stat live are the same dps as lbrs arrows right?
---
You can kill bosses easily without them. This is not the motivation to use the buffs, if you cannot kill boss without them you will not kill the boss with them. It's about increasing efficiency and clear speed.

My friends and I still say this. It's effectively the "Kobe!" Of classic meme fans.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!
---
**Youtube:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvbut2LBKywSOiy_ZOnAJg&gt;   (World PvP Fights, etc.)
---
**How to join?**
---
Join our discord and i will reach out to you: https://discord.gg/STNp9aM
---
The developers. This is also why we have troll mages and orc warlocks: to balance out the classes.
---
Awesome! Only took me 10 tries to get the result I wanted warrior
---
Leashing has been a thing since the beginning, but as long as you dont gwt too far from the leash point the mob won't evade and reset.
---
Only a select few mobs have no leash, like the nightmare dragons (at least I think they don't)
---
Also true, but first you need to complete it.
---
Best case they release naxx and have the content available for an extended period of time so most of the people who are progressing get a chance to clear the content. Rather than releasing BC too soon and only allowing a few guilds to kill KT as they did the first time in 2006.
---
you're a retard

I miss the swirly ball

**&lt;Nightshift&gt;** | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off-peak Hours
---
**Intro:** &lt;Nightshift&gt; is an international guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
**Raid Schedule:** So far it's early days, so there's still a few decisions to make. Regarding raid times, we'll narrow it down later with a survey. At the moment, the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week, starting some time in the AM (EST/EDT.)
---
Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
**Looking for:** Anyone with an unusual schedule who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. Applications for raiders are currently open for all classes. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
**Moving forward:** As for the form the guild will take in the future, it depends on various factors but it will be somewhere between a casual and semi-hardcore type raiding guild. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
**Apply:** If this sounds interesting please check out the link below:

---
If you keep yourself in combat with the mob you should be able to kite it forever i'm pretty sure..
---
Someone's gonna steal your laptop the day before release
---
The hope is real. Would love to roll original account classic.
---
I only raided hardcore on some pservers and all i can say is that in semi-hardcore raiding guild the guildleader and officers are very dedicated but as a normal raider all you have to do is come prepared for the raid and do what they tell you. Those guilds are just more efficient and better organised.
---
How often did we wait for the last 2-3 slackers who didnt log in in time or came 10min late to start the raid in a casual raidguild and an overall loose atmosphere resulting in an 4h molten core.
---
In the semi-hardcore, you may farm one evening for your consumables and prepare your character with worldbuffs or log out where the worldbuff is taking place and you can basically raidlog all week. Raids last tremendously shorter when everyone is on time and prepared, turning the little prep time into a huge bonus towards overall time spent in the raid. You then can crunch the different raidtiers on farm onto fewer days.
---
on what authority is this website correct, my friend?
---
That's clever. Works as long as you don't let it time out.
---
conspiracy theory
---
scroll down to see their source
---
No the other one
---
If the release date doesn’t come soon I’ll be going from 1-60 in a week, to taking my sweet ass time and doing every dungeon multiple times whilst leveling professions and getting exalted with org by 50, in like 4 months. Either way I’ll be happy. The ball is in your court blizz.
---
Also to clarify, Tiger's Fury doesn't increase attack power, it increases your base attack damage by a flat amount.  If the conversion rate listed on vanilla wiki is correct, it takes 14 attack power to equal 1 damage, so at max rank Tiger's Fury is giving you the equivalent of 560 AP for those 6 seconds.
---
It isn't. You'll be more than fine. Raided horde in vanilla and on pserver.
---
Mate you’ll find a raid spot if you want one. The fact you’re on this subreddit already suggests that you’re more informed than most ppl who’ll be playing classic based upon % of player base. 👍
---
People are very willing in my experience, pre-raid BiS ring is quest-reward from emperor, as alliance keep Moira alive and kill Thauss
---
Ofcourse there are semi-hardcore guilds you can join.
---
wod was unplayable at release that's a fact and I said and I quote my self " I would expect some hiccups on classic release " if you interpreted that as a crash-fest then maybe we aren't speaking the same language I don't know english isnt my native tongue other than that I dont know what about my post was almost certainly wrong
---
September 22 get ready [Winter Squid]
---
It was shit true, from what I can see the mobs you can farm have like 8-10% droprate.
---
instruction manuals are a lost art, a casualty of accountants running game companies instead of the programmers.
---
"nobody reads these anyway, lets save money on printing costs!"
---
Think so yeah.
---
Peak content progression was couple years ago with Nost, since then with the fucked up PvP itemisation on LHC and ND it has gone down hill again.
---
&gt; Was playing Divinty Original Sin 2 earlier and healed my Undead friend, thus killing him. 
---
Basically me and a friend until like 40 hours into the game when we finally understood what is determined as healing/poison to actually "heal" me as undead.
---
10/10 would do again, awesome game
---
Ya I almost assure you there’ll be some servers horde some ally and that most min max will roll ally as it is well known they have an easier time in pve. 
---
But yes, I’ll be going Orc Warlock, horde power
---
If something as simple as fear ward makes or breaks you then you just aren’t a good player. Is it helpful? Absolutely? Can you still be good without it? Absolutely.
---
You will have no problem getting a raid spot.
---
Warlocks and druids (even on horde) are the lowest played class. Warlocks are in demand in Vanilla for two reasons.
---
1. Healthstones that are at different talent ranks don't share the same cool down so tanks can use all three... (example one warlock puts no points into improved healthstone, another lock puts 1 points, 3rd puts two points...
---
2. Banish... some fights (Garr for exmaple) 4 warlocks with banish makes the fight easy...
---
TLDR: you will have no problem getting into a raid.
---
I hope I'm dead wrong about Classic not being anything like what we experienced in 2004-2007ish. Game devs are long gone, all that remains is a company. A 100% true vanilla WoW will not make Blizzard money. Again, hope I am wrong.
---
Steaming pile of shit that game was.
---
Horde manage without it.
---
&gt;Why on earth would anyone want release day off?  Plagued with crashing
---
You said this, ' Why on earth would anyone want release day off? Plagued with crashing.'
---
3 of the past 4 expansions this hasn't been true.
---
That part of your post is almost certainly wrong.
---
Firm believer that if you haven’t private servered then you can fuck right off. Where were you when .... filthy casuals.
---
My last guild's MT had Ironfoe way into AQ40. Kinda good item.
---
Looking for a guild (Alliance - NA - PvP - EST)
---
Honestly, I can only ever commit to a casual raid/PvP atmosphere due to my life commitments. My resume is I played back in vanilla and never hit 60 because I was 13 and couldn't stop making alts. I played off and on and ended up getting serious in WotLK and raided MT in Naxx.
---
While I can only spend a few hours each week in game, they will be spent getting progress done! I'm going to main a Human Warlock to 60, and then grind out a priest. Even though I KNOW I can't make raid nights, I'd love to help farm out matts for consumes etc. If I can make a raid, you best believe Ive studied the fight, watched youtube how to's etc. and I don't bitch in voice chat.
---
Finally, I'm also looking to try and PvP some because I feel like it fits with my time commitments. Phase 3 rolls up and now I have 2 hours to play? Lets roll an AB premade and stomp some horde.
---
Anyway, please feel free to PM me in reddit if you want a Casual time, Alliance Warlock on the East Coast who's gonna know their class and is looking for a good home!
---
1 week is all I’ll be able to get ;(
---
Yeah you got some points there. any solution got its ups and downs. Different TBC Server and you can have a **copy** of your lvl 60 char from Classic Server so you keep ur char on classic? but still, if enough ppl are gone playing tbc, theres once againg the risk of a ghost server.  
---
on the Question itself: IMO tbc was the only great expansion so at SOME point in Classic, I think so. But as sinkda said, there are some issues to it.
---
toxic masculinity !
---
 **&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; Alliance | NA | Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Weekends only. Aiming for two nights a week.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/8QV45fP](https://discord.gg/8QV45fP) (mention WoW Classic)
---
Lol I've done a few insane grinds on my Druid but SHOTM did not require that many runs of BRD xD
---
As long as you hit the mob every now and then yes you can kite it forever except world bosses(not after kazzak had a trip to stormwind :D )
---
There's only going going to be like 5 of them per server though...
---
Well I guess there lies the problem since I have never said that
---
I just started leveling a priest on a pserver.  I'm only level 16, but I've been enjoying it.  The leveling process is super smooth since, like others have said, there's no downtime.  I've always been a melee/rogue player, so that may be one reason I'm enjoying it so much; just a nice change of pace!
---
that was such uber pwnage
---
Crusader on both
---
Fuck. I'm a moron.
---
Sorry.
---
Okay, so we're both wrong, there were issues that *some* servers had wasn't entirely playable nor unplayable. Ours was fine minus the garrison stuff.
---
Follow your own desires. I have a friend who wants to play Classic, but he wants to play Horde, so he’s no longer my friend. Jk. He wants to play Horde, but he doesn’t live and breathe the game like I do, it’s unlikely he’ll even get to max level before losing interest. So I don’t want to change my Classic plans to accommodate him. Sure, we’ll play together, but when he inevitably quits I don’t want to be left playing a faction or class that I don’t enjoy. So instead of me changing my plans to suit him, he’ll change his plans to suit me because fuck him he’s a Horde traitor WHO NEEDS HIM ANYWAY DEATH TO THE HORDE.
---
It sounds cold blooded when I write it down but I think it’s an important point to make.
---
I am sure there will be an AH addon. i think aux will carry over to classic but I am not sure.
---
no u ur a face sitting scientist
---
Also why you could interrupt hearthstone casts!
---
Stay strong brother
---
But not on the list! I know they exist, because when I lead a guild, it's always semi-hardcore, or serious, but they aren't represented in this list. Makes me sort of sad.
---
What if no release date because they are behind schedule. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Agreed.
---
# 🔥  &lt;Requiem&gt; 🔥

Horde |⚔  NA-PvP ⚔ | Semi-Hardcore 
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
So, what does the alternative look like?
---
=&gt; WOW survived 10years without token! We dont need any alternative
---
the RP guild I was in, we all had "a wireless communicator of Gnomish design", basically a cell phone, which was guild chat. cringy as fuck
---
I’ve explored all the zones and done most quests. Still, there will always be some that are notorious for being vague, and if a friend or guildie can’t help me out, then it’s either look it up or move on. Sometimes I just move on, but I hate abandoning every quest that isn’t immediately solvable, that’s a good way to be behind on levels.
---
Nobody cares if you play on a private server or not.
---
Where the hell did you make this up? This is 100% bullshit
---
It's a lie
---
Back in ye old days, in my experience AV was much more in favor of Alliance, I would say 70 / 30%
---
I don't think there is a correct answer because Blizzard themselves don't know how it will go yet. For all the hype and the clamour surrounding the release, there is nothing to say the game won't be dead within 12 months as the hype dies down, the reality of the grind sets in and the generally older generation realise they don't have the time or willpower to invest in the game like they used to and maybe things just aren't as great as they remember. 
---
After the initital explosion of subs upon release, how many new people will be subbing on average every month, 12 months down the line?
---
Once they know the game is a success (Which by the way I predict it will be!) then they can start planning for its future. This should certainly be community driven and will be open for a lot of discussion. Personally I believe the way the OSRS team did it should be looked upon as a model for success: Keeping the feel of the original game real whilst adding new content which builds upon that.
---
For example: Revamping the talent tree would be a big no, absolutely no Pandas or monks or demon hunters. Dual talent tree on the other hand could be a welcome change (In the future!) if the community as a whole voted for it, not game breaking by any means but a convenience. 
---
There was even a suggestion that we could follow an alternate timeline in this universe and that would lead to other expacs such as Emerald Dream, this is an interesting idea and I suppose would depend upon the initial success of the game.
---
40 spaces remember, balance druids and retri palas will find spots
---
I mostly just remember tabbing over to Thottbot and having an immediate “ugh” expression. I wasn’t a fan of the jenkiness, but the biggest issue was probably my internet speed. It could handle WoW as well as most people’s internet’s could... horribly, and using Thottbot was just as slow :/ 
---
It’s honestly such a big difference having good or even passable internet this time around.
---
The WoW token already exists in Classic.
---
What’s to stop two players from making a trade like “500g in Classic for a Token in retail?”
---
Haha. I used my bubble wave hearthstone macro over and over denied kill.
---
Same, dude.  I have a baby and a 4 yr old now.  I need shadowmeld so I can AFK at a moment's notice on a pvp realm.  It's not a perfect solution, but it's better.
---
There's no sin in playing a emulation of a game that is no longer being provided.
---
Do you see the difference between posts discussing speed running strats because it's an interesting topic and posts straight up insulting people for playing the game differently than the "elitist casuals" circlejerk crowd?
---
Blizzard has been developing PC games for so many years. They know not to promise dates until they're there. Too many variables to account for in the PC market.
---
Paladin and shamans are the only ones who would benefit from one.  Instant slow heal etc would be nice to.  
---
Since you have to hit in melee only those two of the caster classes would benefit I would say.
---
Resto/enhance shaman LFG NA with semi early raid times  (ending by 9pm EST) preferably. Main goal is to get in a semi HC pve guild with some pvp. Willing to raid as resto but have exp as nightfall enhance shaman
---
Speaking of AV, am I crazy, or could you farm exalted during  AV weekend?
---
Yup I'd actively encourage you to join one, give yourself a chance to do a few starting area quests and familiarise yourself with the game once more.
---
&gt; Now, some of you are assholes through and through and will ignore this completely, but for some this will help I hope.
---
Ahh, okay.
---
Good luck dude. For what it's worth I was sleeping at my sister couch, unemployed and basically hopeless around 25. It's a confusing age. Now it's all mostly on track 7 years later. Just keep being active and move forward one step at a time and things will improve.
---
I got it and thought it was ok.  
---
    
---
All loot is hunter loot.
---
Also, at least in the US, there is a good chance it doesn't release until 3pm or later.
---
I enjoy launch days
---
In a vid a naxx raider said that the noob and trial mages were delegated to frost spells and only the veterans were allowed to go fire due to this.
---
I feel like a decent solution would be to have progression realms already set up as part of the Classic launch. Half the realms will stay vanilla forever, the other half will advance to future expansions.
---
The problem with this, I guess, is that Blizzard probably wants to see whether Classic will be enough of a success, by their own metrics, before they make plans to go beyond vanilla. They could just label some realms as 'possible progression realms' that may or may not progress depending on how Classic does, but knowing how much Blizzard hates saying 'maybe' and then having  people act like it was a promise... That also has its own problems.
---
It's definitely a pickle. But I feel like so many other MMOs have done progression servers that it wouldn't be too crazy for Blizzard to release some at Classic launch that function identically to the rest of the Classic realms, but leave the door open to further progression.
---
I highly preferred the elitist version.
---
Seems inaccurate. Alliance can easily faceroll AV.
---
I got there once before, not sure why I wouldn't get there given infinite time.
---
Reasonably certain they've gotten the memo on this one, time to chill. If they haven't announced it yet, they aren't confident of a timetable. Imagine how pissed you'd be if they prematurely gave a date, everyon takes the time off, and then they push it back a month.
---
My memory is similar. Alliance tended to win AV, Horde tended to win WSG, AB seemed quite competitive but with the Horde generally winning more often.
---
Can this sub please decide on what realm they want to play on so I can stay as far the fuck away as possible? Imagine playing with people like OP.
---
# &lt;Always East&gt;
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | NA | Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have 115 Discord members. Of those, 91 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) The leadership has taken years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

In the heat of battle an opposing player would confuse it with a heal or some other beneficial spell. Great way to fake out someone is to cast your hearth stone to trick them into using their CD interrupt.

as much as I hate myself for saying this... "there is a slippery slope here".. \*punches self in face\*.  Now that that's over with...
---
TBC was great, but people then want WOTLK after that.. and eventually even cata or mop.. does there eventually come a point in time, albeit far down the road.. where blizz manages a retro copy of all their servers?  granted, newer and newer expansions will have less work on their end to upconvert most likely as their data management improved im sure. Yes you will have people playing which xpac they liked the most.. but not necessarily with a large group of people.  
---
I played vanilla wow when it launched.. sitting in dun morogh trying to loot wolves but getting lag out the ass because of server instability.. and I participated in the open beta and stress tests before that.  and I have had an active sub ever since (god that's so much money....) and still raid in bfa live doing heroic / mythic progression in raids.   I have loved the game, clearly, in all it's iterations.. some more than others.. im excited for classic!  But I think the best bet is going to be a wow2 push..  
---
I think tbc is going to be far more work in the LONG run in terms of then they have to do wrath... where as with wow2, they can just keep 2 games (maybe 3) max.. you have wow live.. bfa and whatever is next.. you have wow classic vanilla at 1.13 forever.. just leave it at naxx.. then just go with wow2 after.. make it fresh for classic players but keeping the world relevant.. don't travel to outland which killed the old world.. don't go to outland.. don't destroy the park in stormwind.. etc.  keep leveling difficult.. don't even need to add more levels, just add new dungeons and raids that are t2.5 / 3 equivalent.. or add more catchup blues for better hybrid specs.. it'll change the meta in a world where they meta wont matter because KT has been dead with the old meta forever.
---
but then you risk fragmentation so I don't know what the best choice is here. personally, i'll probably play whatever so does it matter? \*shrug\*
---
They'd obviously prefer the latter option
---
Jesus Christ the internet was so much better back then hahahahaha!
---
\*Sees a lower level player taking your farm
---
\*Voice in the back of my head: ^("Do it")
---
Yeah it will be sad for the war effort to end in like 2 days due to hoarding.
---
Wow, now I know what it feels like to get /r/MurderedByWords
---
Think it's worth having 2 characters on the go at the same time? I'm wanting to main Warrior but the levelling as a Warrior early on without a gold injection is a pain in the ass, so I was thinking about levelling a Hunter first to make some money and then investing that in stuff for levelling the Warrior. Considering making the 2 characters at the start &amp; letting the warrior build up rest xp &amp; then using it up before it caps, rinse &amp; repeat. Do you guys think it's even worth it having 2 characters on the go in the beginning?
---
It's a combination of several things. The meta ends up feeding into itself because the players know what's most desirable and the majority of guilds prefer the highest performance DPS classes.
---
Anyway. Blizzard didn't give Hunters the scaling they needed to be competitive in the endgame. The only raid utility Hunters offer that cannot be found anywhere else is Tranquilizing Shot. The cooldown is so low that two Hunters can maintain a perfect rotation.
---
Unrelated, but I really wish people would stop using the downvote function to downvote factual posts instead of just using it because they dont like what they read.
---
You don't really need to pair engineering with mining. It's relatively inexpensive to buy the mats to level engineering and most of the utility comes from cheap consumables that you only use for effects like stun (so iron grenades).
---
For some reason this post fed me visual viagra, we need a release date soon
---
Osconty
---
When I heard about Classic I rolled on pserver, just to remove any nostalgia and rose tinted glasses.
---
I think so as well. :)
---
Plot Twist: 10 warrior figure came about because they had to fill spots and most people play warrior ^^
---
Are you planning on tanking with that warrior? You could just do Strat live runs and reserve the first orb drop instead of grinding mobs with an alt.
---
part of me really wants to know the future before selecting a server even.  I hear what you're saying about pre-labeling, but they'll have to eventually allow people off who change their minds.. or players who roll and don't know anything about which they'd like better because they started in cata or later. 
---
OSRS (Old School RuneScape) is the top mentioned progressive change server around this subreddit it seems which is all player vote driven but that is more of a wow2 verse a TBC.  Maybe they will put up a wow2 vs tbc vs nothing vote in about 2-3 years (or whatever their phase cycle is -- maybe 1 year if they go quickly) and we will see then.. just kinda wish we got some mention of the future before we start.
---
I wish it weren’t so, but I’m not thinking we’re  getting one. There may have been an internal testing period, but I highly doubt that’s enough to sift through the numerous bugs that will be crawling around.
---
And people still want no changes to the honor system in classic?
---
If only there were only that may... In my current guild I didn't get a spot 2 days ago for a raid because 8 druids were online and they only took 2 to raiding. Stormrage happened to drop from Rag and they disenchanted it because nobody needed...
---
I wonder if they will leave in this feature.
---
sheep is love, sheep is life.   
---
and i think this was before they patched sheeped player to start recovering hp really fast
---
Thanks alot for both mage and rogue as I want to play either of them 🙏
---
&gt; I can also remember back in beta, when Mages had invisibility, that they added in Detect Invisibility to mobs in dungeons to prevent Mages just running through the whole instance and killing the end boss for loot, and eventually this contributed to the spell just being removed. 
---
An ex-Blizzard dev was on the Countdowntoclassic podcast and specifically stated that they removed Invisibility because it was too similar to rogue stealth. Had nothing to do with being able to skip Deadmines trash for that sweet 40s vendor blue.
---
Alliance won like 99% of AV on my server. After a while the queue for AV just never popped because Horde didn't bother to queue. Luckily cross-realm BGs fixed that, but I remember playing like 1 round of it ever and I was never able to get it to queue again and it made 12 year old me so confused.
---
Correction, there is no better way to farm gold IF you can get lotuses. As a warrior you will just get CC'ed and have the lotus taken from you most of the time, unless you happen to find one and there's nobody near but this is true for every other class as well which still leaves warriors with less options for gold farming than anyone else.
---
Dynamic respawns definitely skew the numbers they would get, but they are nevertheless impressive.
---
Not at all.
---
I hope they focus on classic servers, adding new patchs on a distant future (2-3 years?).
---
I don't want to see many dead realms with a low population because there are many expansions not connected between them.
---
&gt; and with every video about Classic or Vanilla I watch my excitement grow 
---
That's funny. With every video about Classic I watch, my cancer tumor grows.
---
Recent polls are showing a big amount of future warlock players. 
---
Probably due to the fact that they are good in PvP &amp; PvE, leveling is easier, ""free mount"" etc...
---
I hope it's not gonna be real...
---
Actually They were "Hired" not told to rebuild Stormwind for free most of the Stonemasons were hung out to dry minus a few of their top rank members such as Van Cleef and Baros Alexston While Baros took the bribe Van Cleef refused out of respect for his men so yes we are the bad guys.
---
You can join a tbc private server, this way you are not fully ruinning the experience and at the same time it's pretty close

 **LF Guild - \[EU\]  \[Alliance\] \[PVP\]**    
---
28 years old, from Serbia.  Planning to play a Human Rogue, and invest a bit more hours than your average casual player. I'm looking for a **Casual to Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild** that's not going to be raiding in standard EU time. Thing is, I work second shift and my work day starts at 5PM CEST, so I need a guild that's gonna be **starting their raids anywhere between 10AM CEST to 1PM CEST**.    
---
Alternatively, my off days are Friday and Saturday, so raiding on those days would work as well, but I doubt any guild is gonna be raiding on those days one after another.  Contact me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mladenq), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mladenq/), discord: mladenq#3702
---
With that mace, might as well just go mace spec, the sword spec is only going to proc off your sword hits. (Offhand only) A faster offhand mace would make for more mace spec procs and all the random stuns would be amazing against casters of any type.
---
maybe as a joke or if the guild is poorly run
---
Why do people ALWAYS have to lie and make up bullshit about private servers? What is it about them that trigger you people so hard?
---
Ironfoe has a 4-5% procrate. Some servers had it at 10%, and nobody to my knowledge ever had it at 15%.
---
Besides, if you are trying to make the argument that its too good on private servers, then next time do your research. It cannot proc on itself on private servers, but on Blizzard servers it could: [https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg)
---
Then: 29, single, debt-free working long hours and weekends, but I was still under 30 so didn't require much sleep.
---
Now: 43, married, kid, swimming in student-loans and mortgage and usually in bed before 9.
---
BUT I DON'T CARE WOOOOOOOOOO
---
There's a whole mechanic I never even imagine was in this game. Amazing.
---
Don't be sad. Hair grows out again
---
1. Forget about lotus if it works exactly like in original
---
2. Lotus works differently on every private server, on k3 I never have anyone around when I find lotus
---
3. Most mid-high level herbs sell for a lot on AH and you make very high gold/hour doing almost any raid herb, not just black lotus. Especially if spawn times are not adjusted.
---
Once BC came out that pretty much killed the smite build because you couldn't put out as much damage as you could in Vanilla relative to peoples total hitpoints.
---
Add in a shaman.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg)
---
Yes this is real Vanilla from 2006. People can fuck off with that "Private servers are too easy" crap.
---
Leashing wasn't a thing in vanilla, I kited multiple big elites and certain bosses (Teremus) frequently. I could kite for minutes in one direction without leashing, which is why I'm kinda nervous that they will implement leashing.
---
You HEARD that eh? Must be true then lol
---
I agree that 2004-2009 was the golden age of WoW and I've been thinking of a similar scenario as well. It would be great to experience it all once again. But there are also many questions surrounding this.
---
I think it's a great decision by Blizzard to have progression throughout Classic. However, at some point most players will have progressed through everything Classic has to offer. What happens then? When the sense of progression fades, will players be bored? This is something I'm genuinely curious about.
---
This is new ground both for Blizzard and us as players.
---
A couple of solutions to this may be:
---
Emulate the release of expansions: The progression continues beyond Classic and Blizzard release TBC Classic and so on.
---
Or, unreleased vanilla content: Sounds great to experience content that was supposed to be in Vanilla or never made the cut. But, will it deviate too much from the vanilla experience? I'm not even sure if I would want that.
---
If Blizzard were to go with expansion progression realms, this also means that they essentially would have 3 instances of WoW developed and supported at the same time. I don't think that's very practical. When time comes I think Blizzard need to decide where they would like to take Classic.
---
Ultimately, it's impossible to say at this time. I think we need to see what the community want. After all, they are the reason we're sitting here today.
---
That was the gimmick. You only had 150% crits vs 200%.
---
What you made up for that missing 50% was the ability to heal yourself. Fighting rogues/warriors/etc. was a matter of outlasting them. For rogues it was surviving their stunlocks until you could get your 2nd or 3rd physic scream in and they don't have any trinkets/Will of the Forsaken and then you just drop everything you got on them.
---
Just vendoring BoEs is plenty, no need for AH
---
The Hunter epic quest straight-up expects you to kite one of the demons across most of Winterspring.
---
Lol what a braindead response. Didnt read what you replied to AT ALL.
---
You do not need to use the AH to afford a mount at 40.
---
Beckons videos look right. I remember dropping Smites/Holy Fires in the 1000-1500 range.
---
This was when most people on average had only 3000-4000 hp.
---
Because its not like you can just stealth in and solofarm it. That boss isnt located near where you will be going on your way to a Lavarun.
---
Other games make this bannable. Obviously it still happens, just not on public channels. I predict the same will happen for Classic.
---
I want it just so people will rage and call it a waste
---
I have a horrible confession to make. I looted HoJ on my hunter as I honestly thought it worked with bows.. this was wotl. Nobody in my group seemed to care except the rogue who was FURIOUS and was PM'ing me with heaps of stuff, so I blocked him.  I went to test the the proc on target dummies and must have realised or read the description properly and realised what I had done. I can't remember if this was during loot trading or if the group was LFG, but I couldn't get the trinket back to him. I think I still have it on my hunter.
---
I prefer skinning over mining/herbalism because it doesn't require fighting over nodes. If you're playing at launch the nodes will be hotly contested for a while. So keeping mining / herbalism relevant while you level will probably slow you down - not necessarily a big deal if you're not trying to speed through. Tailoring will make lots of money early on because everyone will need bags. It'll slow down a bit later, but you're going to switch at 60 anyway. I'd suggest skinning / tailoring if you're playing near launch. Everything you do will be easy to farm without having to hunt for nodes.
---
Skinning isn't something you'll make a ton of money from a small stack of mats. You're going to sell the leather to vendors, not on the AH. But it's consistent extra money that you can control and farm reliably.
---
At 60 - iff you have a decent income source - it's not very expensive to level engineering without picking up mining (usually it takes less time to farm the money to buy the leveling mats off the AH than to ride around looking for mining nodes). Most of the utility from engineering for PvP comes from cheap consumables; you're going to make cheap grenades for the stuns, not for the damage. So buying your engineering mats for items to use in PvP is also easy to do on the AH.
---
To pair with engineering, I'd either go skinning or herbalism. Skinning if you can farm mobs easily (i.e. you're not going Prot on your warrior), herbalism otherwise. There will always be a market for consumables. When the prices drop, just hold on to them until the next content release. People will buy up tons of mats from the AH when new raids are released.
---
Each server will likely be different, though the trend I've noticed is something like: best guild is Alliance, 2nd and 3rd are horde. Make of that what you will.
---
This has been talked to the death. However it's a very divisive topic and posts either get downvoted or the mods will remove them (they explicitly said that these kinds of posts will be frowned upon in their latest post). This is understandable as Classic isn't out yet and both people playing and Blizzard should really focus on Classic first.
---
All that said, my prediction (and in my opinion the best solution) is that there will be separate servers for *all* expansions *eventually*.
---
That's by far the easiest and most profitable for Blizzard. Bringing back expansions will be easier than the base game (as they are newer and Blizzard will have all the data) and they already have the experienced team for the job. There are a lot of people who'll gladly play TBC, Wrath and yes, even the later expansions. In the end a lot of people will basically never unsubscribe. ;) Obviously, unless Blizzard is completely brain-dead, these will all be separate servers. Otherwise people would rightfully be outraged that their favorite expansion becomes unavailable again.
---
Everything else is basically a pipe dream.
---
First, Blizzard will not change Classic (or Classic TBC, etc.) into something else. They would risk the tremendous outrage of those who want to play the originals (after all the grinding of teeth and finally bringing back earlier iterations, it just won't happen). Also, there are a thousand different ideas of what changes would be good. Any change would anger a lot of people, there is no pleasing of the majority (and no OSRS doesn't count, WoW is a rather different game and Blizzard is a rather different developer, that model would never work).
---
Second, as said, Classic is a low budget project as would be all other expansions. Blizzard will not risk a lot of money on some alternate "WoW Classic+". There is a WoW they pour the money into and that's current.
---
Third and most important, the Blizzard of old which created Vanilla is long dead. They'll never create anything like it. If in some unfortunate turn of events the "changes" crowd got their wishes and Blizzard *did* try to appease them by "continuing" Classic in a different direction, it would be a disaster. It'd be nothing like people are hoping for, some "Classic like MMO". It'd be like BfA.
---
If they completely removed the auction house and trading it would still not be a hassle to get the gold, so long as you're not concocting excuses to spend gold. Like a better wand or weapon every few level.
---
Man I like the Alliance cities more too but Horde has Barrens and SFK. Ist so hard to choose.
---
Don't forget the lacking evidence that earth is spherical
---
Yea my cousins friends boyfriends mother plays on a private server and he said she told him that.
---
BiS for AFKing in IF
---
Its really going to vary based on tourists etc... for each server. Pick what interests you more. You've got the option for a server transfer if you really need it.
---
Zug zug
---
That only means you will be first in line for Naxx weapons. I dont see how its a problem.
---
&lt;FREE HUGS&gt; PvP [NA] Horde (Raid Progression)
---
- FREE HUGS is a newly formed guild for those who would like to participate in our raiding, along with becoming a member of our growing family.
---
- We are recruiting just about anyone of any class. We don't have a whole lot of members as of today, but the sooner you join, the more time we have to get to know you and perhaps talk about roles.
---
- We are planning in raiding every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 7 - 10 PM CST. Dungeons and farming old raids will be done on off raid hours. (Times may change depending on the feedback from the guild.)
---
- We expect that every member who joins does their homework, learns their class, learns the raids, and brings their good stuff. Our goal is to progress through the raids and we need all the help and support we can get.
---
- Class officers will help with supplying class info, and raid officers will help with sending info about the raids for people to learn.
---
- Our loot system will start off with a priority system (giving the loot to the more critical classes) then continuing it with a DKP system. Points will be accumulated based on raid performance.
---
- We accept anyone of any age and of any experience. No matter if you are new to Classic, or if you are a Veteran player, you are welcome here!
---
Please send a message @NeonInuGanetto#3614 if you would like to join!
---
The higher the 'tier' of guilds, the higher the warrior number becomes. In the top % of guilds you'd see the amount of warriors closer to the 20 mark than the 10 shown here, especially horde-side.
---
It does not bother me. People are in for a rude awakening if they think they're going to casually play a Hunter 8 hours a week and sniff the inside of anything past BWL.
---
10-15% was the commonly used procrate on mangos servers back in fe*nix days (2011-2014). Now most respectable private servers use 1ppm (4%) as their baseline (which is probably also the correct one).
---
Yeah I have no clue. Typically if a character is transferred to another account, it should display in the transactions, but in this case it's blank. They refuse to give me the account name it was transferred to, even though they claim it was me that made it, lol. Like ???.
---
It really depends on the player and their goals.  As a raider (and this further depends on how hardcore you are), you will have to buy consumables or spend time farming those instead of gold.. depending on how hardcore is how much you need to farm.  Also repair bills could add up early on.
---
Depends on what class you are as some classes are able to farm gold easier than others as well.  If you are a mage/hunter or even a rogue you could probably farm pretty easily before DM comes out even.  If you are like a warrior, it will be more difficult to farm gold solo. 
---
Also, your level 40 mount wont necessarily be "easy" even.  A lot of people are going skinning to vendor skins for extra gold, and not buying skills, or finding a mage friend for water and no playing of the AH really since no one will really be buying off of it.   But in some cases, it makes sense to spend money on the AH early, like a lot of melee classes need better weapons off the AH to grind / level more efficiently and may spend money on that and risk getting their mount at 43/45 to be able to level faster and survive longer. 
---
But to answer your question about the epic mounts, I think we will see a lot more early on than we did in original vanilla, but I don't think it'll be a small feat to accomplish. Even if at best you make like 30/40g an hour doing some mara runs or something on your hunter (depending on how classic ends up working out).  That is still about 22 to 30 hours of /played time farming gold.  So a long weekend for some, but many weeks for others.   
---
Really depends on the player and their goals, as I said earlier.
---
One thing I forgot to add which made the smite build so flexible was you could heal in raids and then when it was PvP time, just switch equipment, and head over. This meant if you want full discipline you were missing out on some feats from Holy that reduced your spell costs, but you compensated with that by having a bigger mana pool.
---
So it was a matter of switching our equipment between raids &amp; PvP.
---
Nobody really knows the procrates. It could be 5%, it could be higher or it could be lower.
---
In any case it should be better than on private servers considering how it procs on itself in Classic: [https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IkpvUVx.jpg)
---
Does that work?
---
Ya this guy never played pservers apparently
---
Emp runs were spammed quite frequently. HoJ and a shot at ironfoe, nearly every melee looking for pre raid bis wants in
---
I don't think that's the case anymore. At least not for every product. Classic demo was really scuffed and felt rushed.
---
True, I can see that.

 **&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; \[A\] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen  Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we are  targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post is  completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything that  is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meistä**
---
Frozen  Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu lähinnä  MMO-pelejä pelaava suomikilta, joka sen jälkeen on muodostunut  massiiviseksi pelaajayhteisöksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat  erittäin vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi  pienestä Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan  kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in,  Lotron, EVE Onlinen sekä monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista  näistä peleistä pelataan vielä, toisia enemmän ja toisia vähemmän, ja  tarkoituksenamme on myös jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien  pelien pariin. Tällä hetkellä killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final  Fantasy XIV:ssä, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons  Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu  Azerothiin ISOSTI, sillä WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteisömme  isoista peleistä, jossa pyritään saavuttamaan merkittävä status tulevan  Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja  menestyvin Suomikilta alkuperäiseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean  MMORPG:n yhteisöllisyydestä ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni  myös perheellisiä, eikä meillä ole välttämättä aikaa enää raidata  viittä päivää viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina  raideista PvP:hen sillä ajalla, joka meillä on käytettävissä.
---
**Mitä tarjoamme?**
---
Pitkäikäisen  ja menestyneen pelaajayhteisön, jonka riveissä SINULLA on mahdollisuus  pelata juuri niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat, mutta silti saavuttaa  myös menestystä pelissä hyvällä porukalla. Me emme halua pakottaa sinua  mihinkään - saat pelata täsmälleen sitä hahmoa jota haluat, täsmälleen  niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat. Toivomme ensisijaisesti uusiksi  Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria omaavia ihmisiä. Se,  oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole tärkeää. Tärkeää on se, että  sinulla on järki päässä ja sydän paikallaan. Meillä ei ole  osallistumispakkoja, vaan osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meillä on  kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja rennon toimintatavan ohella myös  mahdollisuus pelata ryhmissä, joissa on korkeat tavoitteet, ja näihin  toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia ja pitkäpinnaisia pelaajia, joilta  löytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.
---
**Raidaus**
---
Tällä  hetkellä suunnittelemme, että Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3  kertaa viikossa inhimillisellä aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme  on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content pelissä, mutta maaliin ei ole  kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteistyössä koko killan  jäsenistön kesken lähempänä julkaisuaikataulua.
---
**PvP**
---
Killassa  tullaan myös järjestämään organisoitua PvP:tä. Myös korkeampaa PvP  rankkia metsästäviä killasta löytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita  myös Horden nirhaushommissa.
---
**Hakeminen**
---
Meille voi hakea yhteisömme web-sivuilla: [https://www.frozendawn.fi/](https://www.frozendawn.fi/) Selaa foorumeille ja sieltä löytyvälle alafoorumille ”WoW Classic hakemukset”. Hakemusohje löytyy foorumin kiinteänä viestinä.

It used to atleast!
---
I think some people are just hoping that Pservers have all been catastrophically wrong so that the resources and logs that have been developed are totally useless and Classic is more a of a fresh start.              
---
There are going to be differences but anyone that think it's gonna totally shake up class balance or raid comp are probably gonna be disappointed.
---
Shadowburn on cooldown is utterly pointless
---
On 16 debuffs there's no trouble whatsoever to get shards either.
---
Okay, give them notice then. Pick a date when you're sure the game will be out. I picked august like I said, there's no way the game won't be out by then.
---
On Horde side some 'good' guilds might decide to use only two locks, for CoE and CoR and won't make a big deal out of not having a 3rd, making locks sometimes frustrating to play competitively(which is half the fun of a dps class).
---
That would depend on what procrate it will have in classic.
---
Horde Resto Druid, North America, LFG (PvE but open to any server type). Eastern or Central Time.
---
Older adult with time constrictions that would make a raiding schedule hard to meet, but want to get thru pre-raid and see where it goes. Looking for a group of people with similar approach. Been playing since Open Beta. Raided Classic as Holy Pally thru Naxx on Azgalor (Righteous Dawn, Ravens of Stormwind). Raided TBC as Resto Druid. Raided Wrath as DK, Resto Druid, and Resto Shammy. MoP as Resto Druid. Been playing rest of content off/on to see it all.
---
Want to get the most out of my Classic time and see it all again!
---
Have seen a few guilds that Ive reached out to, but nothing that fits me 100%. Hit me up on Reddit if you think Id be a good fit! Looking forward to seeing yall in Classic.
---
&gt; The guild loot distribution system can, and likely will change. Sometimes they play around with DKP. A few weeks later, they might just run loot based on need. This obviously can cause lots of drama but don't expect loot distribution to stay the same.
---
Truer words have not been spoken about casual raiding guilds
---
I did it and I've enjoyed it a the way from 1 to full epics. Played a faction race and class I won't play in proper classic to regain freshness.
---
Rofl. Because giving us 1.12.1 PvP gear before BWL patch is any better?
---
You do know Crusader heal aswell right?
---
I have always loved Will of the Forsaken for PvP. Warrior PvP trinket gets you out of stun, root, and slow so WotF will add charm, fear, and sleep to the CC effects you can jump out of. Of course, Orc passive resist to stuns is good and the Tauren AoE stun are both lovely as well. None are wrong, but I feel like WotF will help the most.
---
***Imagine being this insecure.***
---
You have orc warlocks because orcs were the original WLs.
---
Came here to add my take on that to the thread. I've created a bridge to cross the bridge between social and hardcore
---
People have to chill. There will be a spot for every class...
---
Sorry but since when?
---
1 yard is not a significant advantage.
---
Just because you did well with this build, does not mean everything you say is correct
---
Face shitty opponents = feel godlike no matter your buils
---
The hunter way. Stealing shit. I love it!
---
Depends on how much money \*\*Activision\*\* wants to make. Im more worried about wow classic coming out on phones to be honest
---
Why do people get so butthurt when i point out that Private servers aren't 100% accurate? Don't like that fact or something? Sure its a semi-accurate representation, but the fact is that most data was GUESSED, and ESTIMATED. Period.
---
This is correct. One week for the supplies to be moved to Silithis and then the Gong becomes bangable (giggity) at which point you or anyone else has 10 hours to bang the gong
---
I dont know about rogues but for warrior your OH speed wont matter much at all. That being said, you'll preferably want a stat-stick in your OH rather than a weapon relying on procs because it will proc less in OH due to the fact that your OH produces no instant attacks.
---
You can get enough gold for the mount + skill if you have skinning alone as long as you play in a very conservative matter and won't spend money on items from vendors or AH. People that really aims to get the mount at 40 will easily get it, but the majority won't get it until 45-55.
---
Yep. The people freaking out over 1.12 PVP gear are overblowing the issue. I will say though, that at least for plate wearers - the armor pieces don't really get replaced until Naxx / late AQ40. There are some key pieces that have crit/hit on them, plus the set bonuses are great for PVE DPS too. There aren't that many pve blues (or epics for that matter) that replace the epics from pvp in this regard.
---
It was an intense grind getting the higher ranks. I remember having to do BGs for 4 hours a day just to get to rank 12. I stopped doing the BG grind because I could get better gear from raiding.
---
That must look hillarious.
---
*Whispers a tank: "Hey, wanna tank BRD emp lava run? Ironfoe is reserved for me though"*
---
Dire Maul has both, BRD has mining nodes, Maraudon has both.
---
Yeah but hardcore players do twice the dps of top players back then (if not more) with all the insane buff stacking. Pretty sure they would rape cthun regardless.
---
Is shadowform ok?!
---
Oh, god. All I remember is getting a wand, using Power Word Shield, and just wanding things to death. Spirit Tap kept you getting. Once you got to lvl 40 you could get Shadow Form and it was a lot easier.
---
Even at a 4-5% procrate (1ppm) Ironfoe will be a VERY solid choice well into BWL atleast. Speaking of warriors that is.
---
Definitely didn’t happen. I remember every guild I was in since classic, and my vanilla guild was dog-shit. To forget your guild name when you were #2 NA? Okay kid
---
Absolutely.
---
Nostalrius progression was the heydays of PvP participation.
---
Folks PvPed for R7-10 gear to equip 2 +sp gear, a select few nerds went for R14, quite a few went for R12 (shamans) or R12-13 like spellcasters.
---
Pretty much everyone at 60 interested in good pieces ranked atleast to 7. 
---
LHC and ND PvP scene was dogshit in comparison to Nostalrius one. 
---
If one person of a 2.5-4k server acquires R14 weapons shortly after BWL is out, then this really is a minor drawback for the absolute massive PvP participation all around the entire population.
---
It might not be as great on PvE servers, because people get incentivized to PvP when they went on PvE servers to not deal with PvP in any form whatsoever.
---
Oh I know they are not fully accurate alright. Doesnt mean I am fine with people blatantly lying like you are are to make them seem much worse than they are.
---
I mean, are you actually surprised that people get upset when you pull numbers out of thin air without a care in the world for facts? Stop being a disgusting lier and you will find that people wont be "butthurt" in every response to your nonsense.
---
Goes both ways dude. Something that seem very difficult to grasp for some.
---
As a long time warrior player, I started leveling a mage beforehand to get that extra income to ease the pain of early warrior levels. Mage has a lot of passive money potential in portals, food, and easy farming. I would highly recommend this method from experience. It's really easy to get burnt out and frustrated while leveling a warrior unless you have a lot of support from other players, or have that big gold injection like you mentioned.
---
**Moderate**: Looking for that Guild with a social feel but don't want to be stuck wiping on raid trash forever? This guild is probably for few. Often a hodgepodge of older experienced players with a sprinkling of newbies, you'll often find these guilds populated with older players that have done the content when it was hot and want a slightly more scenic route in their older age.
---
Pros:    
---
* Always people to level and do content with.  
---
* Can usually clear raids not too far behind the hardcore guilds  
---
* Tend to have more relaxed older players, so less drama  
---
* Accommodating raid + events schedule  
---
* Offer more freedom to play how you want
---
Cons:  
---
* Won't be getting server firsts
---
* Not as populated at social guilds, so may be quieter if you play off time-zone
---
* Old habits die hard, hardcore streaks may come to light as raids get more difficult
---
* You probably joined this Guild to play less but more efficiently. Instead you're playing all night, arriving late to work and have already committed to an irl pub meet-up this summer.
---
^Obligatory ^^&lt;The ^^Nuke ^^and ^^Turtle&gt; ^^^is ^^^^recruiting
---
Honestly they are fun and unless you are someone who desperately once it to all be fresh the second you log in, it's worth rolling on one.  I wanted to find out if adult me preferred and vanilla classes more than 13 year old me. I used a Pserver to find and after leveling most classed to 20-35 the diagnosis is in: being a huntard isn't curable, I will live with this for the rest of my life.

# &lt;Delusional&gt; &lt;Alliance&gt;

 We are a Australian &amp; New Zealand based guild, we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach. Our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner and time. We are looking to be in the top ranks of the Oceanic guilds.  Discord: [https://discord.gg/EEtgnSY](https://discord.gg/EEtgnSY) 
---
*  Realm : Oceanic 
---
*  Realm Type: PVP 
---
*  Faction:  Alliance 
---
*  Region: Aus/Nz
---
* Timezone: GMT+10 AEST 
---
* Guild Type: Semi-hardcore 
---
* Progression Raiding Times: Thursday, Friday, Sunday &lt;6:30Pm-1030Pm&gt; 
---
* Farming Raiding Times:Thursday, Sunday &lt;6:30Pm-1030Pm&gt;  
---
* Loot Rules: loot counciled with fairness   
---
* A Mindset for Progression: We want the players that have experience with end game progression in mmos. Players who understand that it takes wipes, analysing the problems, and implementing change in order to kill a boss. 
---
*  Dedication to the Team: We want players who understand they are part of a team. We value players who put the teams needs before their own, sacrificing their own personal gain to push the guild forward. Players that play for themselves and put their parse over the needs of the team or are loot hungry will be removed from the environment.  
---
* A Humble Approach: We expect players to always look to better themselves no matter how good they consider themselves. There is always something you can do better. Along with this comes being able to accept criticism without giving excuses.  
---
* A Mature Mindset: We are an 18+ environment and childish outbursts will not be tolerated here. You are expected to be respectful, calm, and able to work with others. We still joke and have a good time together but when it comes down to progression time, things are serious.
---
I think people do get enjoyment out of all of the other things that you mentioned. But I do think people need to hear other people say "Just enjoy the game"
---
I personally get pleasure out of the idea of what class to roll, what route i'm going to take, what weapons I get. How I might have to modify the route depending on the people. I think those people get enjoyment out of that too.
---
Can't you though?
---
Respect to you for being nice about it, you sound like the dream room mate, but that's pretty disgusting that it was allowed to happen.
---
If I fucked up on that level, I couldn't look that person in the eye until I bought them a new PC - even after that I'd have to think very hard about the choices that lead to that happening lol
---
Not a single chanse from hell is that screenshot from vanilla vanilla, get your shit together and dont overhype a broken weapon.
---
So you met a GIRL?
---
Thx a lot man, appreciate it.  
---
Good luck for the rest of the classes, i'm interested about pala and hunter :p
---
Tripping on your cape?
---
Which expansion(s) explained the lore of old world Azeroth?
---
Trust me it's no fun I'm experiencing it now because right as it falls off the off hand trash weapon out of aq comes out and makes it good again. But I mean everyone will get the trash maces out of naxx so you'll never be special.
---
I did it, and it was great. Though I now kind of wish I had waited, so it could allllll be fresh.
---
hm... You Are Rakh'likh, Demon! (a quite interesting quest chain)
---
I joined a less popular pserver back after Classic was announced to get to know what it's all about (started playing WoW in Legion prepatch) and found it to be a really fun game. Now I won't have a summer... ;)
---
Any dedicated player will find a guild if they pick a 'normal' class. 
---
Obviously for your "#1 guild on realm" goal this will be harder for a lock on horde, as top horde guilds tends to be more melee-focussed, meaning it's usually a smaller lock roster compared to alliance.
---
But really, with the amount of player retention (which won't be as high as real vanilla at all I recon) there will always be spots to fill in any sort of guild.
---
It'll still be good even at 1ppm it's really good again as human with the anubisath mace.
---
Its almost like they know that rushing that, BfA, etc were mistakes, so when they have a more niche project they dont *want* to make that mistake.
---
step 1: be in a normal guild  
---
step 2: profit
---
Are you *really* complaining that a *demo* was barebones?
---
Seriously?
---
Also that had to be done on a deadline to go with Blizzcon.  They dont have that issue this time.
---
There’s two options.
---
WoW tokens or a world full of gold farmers.
---
I’ll be buying gold either way, up to blizzard to decide who gets paid.
---
People sitting in roots while you bear dance and then run away makes people rage at you too.Its almost even.Some classes pvp trinkets remove roots but none removes MC besides WoTF as far as i remember.
---
I will enjoy when the top PVP guild camps you until you want to end your pitiful existence :) Care Bear! Bahahaha.
---
I think people lose sight of this. People who haven’t played Vanilla in a while underestimate how much game there is when leveling up. It’s cool if anybody wants to rush to 60 because they enjoy the endgame more. But still, as someone who *has plans* to do every raid, most of the game’s content is from 1-59. You will miss so many friendships and struggles, awesome loot to build your character and become immersed. 
---
But if you hate 1-59 so much that you don’t run a single dungeon, or specifically follow a speed leveling guide, that’s up to you. Personally, I want to have my first 60 a few months into the game. I still want to be apart of the initial foothold into MC, and get my gear built up. But I want to have friends that have leveled with me, and all the memories from raising that toon from the ground.
---
Maining a mage.. this has me so hyped!!!
---
I'd like to recruit your dad into my guild.
---
Yep, I'm a hybrid main since forever (feral/resto for og vanilla, die hard pally ever since).
---
They're underselling it. If you spec wand, then shadow. You can run a rotation getting a mob down to like 30% hp before you wand, granted you might drink every 4th or 5th kill but it's only "Yikes" if you want to do it the hyper efficient zero downtime way.
---
My guild managed to clear all the way up to Kel'Thuzad during Vanilla. Back then we didn't care about being #1.
---
The issues about consumables, resistance gear, and gear requirements was true. Making flasks and other things took a considerable amount of grinding running around trying to find rare herbs. Certain bosses were gear checks because your tanks, dps, everyone all had to be on the same gear level to stand a chance.
---
It was still satisfying once BC came out and we all hit lvl 70 and took a raid to go back into Naxxramas just to finish it off.
---
Just be choosy about which skills you train. Amplify magic rank 2? Yea that can wait.
---
choppin up some veggies with that shit
---
Gotta appreciation the honesty.
---
Right... like, play what you want, but when it comes to raids, you have to *expect* an uphill battle.
---
Well, how was it?
---
I think making those buffs last longer would have pretty much no impact on gameplay except making the class more fun. I feel the same way with Shaman weapon buffs and rogue poisons.
---
«its mathematicaly impossible, raid need to do 230k damage in 60 seconds»
---
4k dps impossible for a 40 man raid ? Even if damage is splitted all across the room like he said, thats really not alot.
---
Or it could be my old server where Alliance won all the BGs.
---
...Leeroy... nope that’s taken, back to square one.
---
Had all of the above including ironfoe.
---
It was low.  If I spammed hamstring in an infinite rage situation, one of the 3 would prove in 10 seconds.
---
Most people found ironfoe to not be good enough compared to higher dps items for building aggro.
---
In alliance you don't find rexxar, rexxar finds you!
---
I’m joining horde because apparently they win 90% of WSG!
---
Technically yes, people over exaggerate how easy it is by saying “you can do it in one AV weekend.”  
---
It’s easy to do if you have a premade that is rushing every game so you get 30 minute wins. Then you do that for 8 hours both Saturday and Sunday.
---
Stop saying he's a troll. He's actually more correct than you are lead to believe. Its funny how most of this sub reddit downplays pservers when in reality they serve a very accurate experience for vanilla. Like somehow all people who play pservers have a scarlet letter and you have to judge them as idiotic or purposefully trolling.
---
every class (with a real spec*)
---
Missed auto shot joke detected.
---
That boss is located at the very start of the entrance. You can literally go in and solo kill him as a druid in 5 minutes.
---
What if it’s an undead Mage?
---
Druid: 
---
bear form, yes. If you get the FP in CT while questing on that side, and set HS in TB before Moonglade then it doesn't take much time to do it.
---
Warrior: 
---
def stance, yes. 
---
Berserker stance, Intercept - aye, Also the start of Cyclonian so I would do it.
---
There's alot of use for kitting in BWL trash and also for pulling certain adds away from bosses.
---
I took the entire release week of WoD off.  I was there the minute the servers opened.   I never ran into any issues other than a small bit of phasing lag the very first night which was fixed by dawn the next day.....and I was on mal'ganis...not exactly a small server.
---
Shadow Oil I guess
---
where is the proof?
---
In dungeons, especially, it depends on the group. If the tank is experienced/well geared and/or we are using CC, then you bet your ass I’m going to be dpsing as healer.
---
If it’s tanks first time running the dungeon, or the tank is reckless with oils, or dps are idiots, then I will focus on keeping everyone alive (except for the rogue who refuses to focus marked mob and keeps pulling aggro).
---
Though, when I do DPS as a healer, I do so without having to use too much mana - either wand as priest, cat form as druid, flametongue/searing as sham. Definitely do not want to waste any unnecessary mana on dps, only to be surprised/wiped by a pat/runner and have no mana left.
---
Right... if they give us a date because of outcry, and have to delay it, the outrage would be insane...
---
People need to put in their vacation time later, towards August, if they are reaching their deadline.
---
Yeah it's rough. Even worse is that if you detarget the enemy, or target something else, the points are lost. I would love it they stuck around for like 10 seconds or something. There's a lot of times in dungeons where I'll be fighting something and have to use my energy to kick/gouge something else, then jump back on my original target and my points are gone. nooo
---
W3 has the orcs sailing to kalimdor, sky orgrimmar could hardly have been established before then.
---
Achievements have a lot of awesome purposes as well, though.  Recently i realized i had *never* in my nearly 10 years of playing done The Botanica, for example.  It helps me keep track of which questlines i never finished off (due to switching characters, not playing as much, etc) like the Firelands stuff, or some of the Island of Thunder things.
---
Dont get me wrong, im not asking for them in Classic, but to shit on a whole system that has plenty of good effects (along with some bad, and a community that has bastardized it) isnt really fair.
---
Yes, for sure. I even stated that myself in another post. It will atleast have use well into BWL. Waaaaay past pre-raid no doubt about it.
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19290/darkmoon-card-twisting-nether](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19290/darkmoon-card-twisting-nether)
---
Darkmoon Card: Twisting Nether
---
Gave a 10% chance to rez with 20% health and mana. Such a silly and fun trinket :P
---
Yeah, on many servers it was so bad... remember Blizzard awarding everybody like 3 days of game time as an apology?
---
Yes I do but the procs rate are not the same.
---
If I played with the spec proposed by OP it would be because I like to see many numbers on my screen because this is clearly not an op spec so I would go with lifestealing that could proc a lot compared to crusader.
---
What if they cancel it after 3 weeks though because we thought we did but we didn’t?
---
Excuse me? What if I want to play this with my wife and children?
---
Yeah there's a weird take on playing the game hardcore someone's. Like a strange combo of how much people card when it was new with how many consumables people use on private servers to create Method but with no sponsorships.
---
Yes please! I need to put in my vacation days SOON (TM).
---
This subreddit is hyper defensive about the idear that vanilla is actually hard.
---
Do you know if Warlocks require any gear for this or if they can do it early in to level 60 with greens and blues?
---
Whenever I see a post trail that ends in “fuck, sorry” I wish I had more money to shovel out gold, that rarely happens.
---
I played a NE Priest during Vanilla and shadowmeld was worth it. In PvP you could pick spots and hide so the other team didn't know you were there. You could run off to the side and shadowmeld + eat/drink and get a break from combat. You could also shadowmeld to break peoples target on you. You could also do things like heartstone + shadowmeld at the same time. Shadowmeld saved me alot of times from getting ganked in Vanilla or getting away after being ganked.
---
If people were chasing you and you were in a foresty/jungle area you could lay down on the ground and shadowmeld and blend into the surroundings. People wouldn't see you.
---
in PvE, Shadowmeld was another aggro drop like Fade and a means from getting jumped on by monsters you didn't want to fight.
---
Starshards was okay, but you would rarely use it. The only times I would actually use it was against mages who would waste their counterspell on it.
---
Elune's Grace helped alittle, but it didn't make a huge difference. You used it mainly as a buffer for dispels.
---
Overall NE Priest racials are really worth if. Dwarf racials for PvP are quite simply better if you don't care about the stealth benefits and playing a dwarf.
---
Brb, buying lottery ticket.
---
I love gouge, but it does limit your gameplay choices sometimes.
---
We usually bring 1-2 hunters and 1-2 druids TOPS.
---
There better be some sort of working macro script. If not, it won't be classic like.
---
Yeah, but Force Reactive Disk is 8 arcanite bars, and you probably want two Disks.
---
HOLY FUCK! It’s been 10 days since I saw that website.... just 9 more to go and we’re there &lt;.&lt;
---
How bout HoEtO prom and insta cap AB flags
---
I dont know how they did in early vanilla and early talents but with 1.12.1 talents they'll be blown out of the water by pretty much all other DPS classes.
---
You are adorable. Upvoted.
---
Wouldn't worry about the BiS considering you'll probably already be in MC at that point. Don't forget DM is coming months after classic launch.
---
I want an Andrew WK version
---
You are not pointing that out though you are a smug asshole about it and you think "I remember it from back then" is somehow a better source than the pserver devs that invest a huge chunk of their free time trying to find things out.
---
Not just buying stuff in the AH. Depending on your bag space you should also refrain from buying skills that you don't use. Obviously this applies to some classes more than others but generally speaking skills were where most of your money went into during leveling.
---
If you're not aware of the high costs of the mount at 40 then chances are you had to do a couple of additional quests without the mount to farm up the gold.
---
I still have the lean wolf steak quest! I share it in BGs occasionally
---
Yes, 99% of BRD lava runs are with a warrior reserving it.
---
He’s reaching for that delicious chocolate raggy
---
Those Reckoning procs, tho...
---
It's super easy and you can do it with 100% reliability. You just run around a circle casting serpent and the ocassional autos and multi and repeat until dead, the caster constantly get's los cucked so he's not a concern.
---
Yea, that was it!
---
Man this is gold. You don't deserve your downvotes.
---
No it doesnt
---
I'm complaining about demo not being Classic. Shamans could use 2h without 2h talent, energy was regening much faster that it should've been, hunters going in combat when pet started running towards target and more and more. This is all class related that private servers did right and might Blizzard couldn't handle for demo.
---
1-20 is like 20 hrs played. I the real shit storm starts from like 28 to 60.
---
Nothing (aside from the fact that 500g classic is actually probably worth more than 1 WoW token).
---
But at this point you're talking about breaking ToS so you might as well save the hassle and buy gold from the Chinese.
---
i actually shuddered when i read this
---
Hunters are top tier in MC..
---
Ironfoe is probably a lot better for SoR paladins - it synergies really well with both pros and extra hits. If only it wasn't such a memespec.
---
I've already got full drops on T1 gear as I've saved points from my main guild. We are ready and we are going to be leveling in duos to get to 60 fastest possible time pushing for server firsts.
---
Exactly. Im just gonna play the first week or two after work. By the 3rd week, is when I’ll grab a few days off.
---
ret pallies wont get gear prio over anything, unless its the GM playing ret lol
---
I think they gauge interest over time and see what people actually want. Classic TBC is almost a given if Classic Vanilla does well. Wrath is where things start to get iffy because it's the point at which subs leveled out. I'd personally play an official Wrath server after the others, but no further.
---
i'll be taking a little break from retail as i play classic just because i want to devote my currently limited time to it. but yea, i'll play both
---
I’m still patiently waiting for Warcraft IV.
---
There's also some leather hit boots in there that a druid might want, I think.
---
True, true! Thanks for reminding me. I'd still do it for gold though.
---
Thanks. EZgold it is then.
---
there was also a lvl 50 epic 1 hand axe that was a world drop in areas of around the same level that had a somewhat substantial proc rate, but it was 500g on the AH level rare from what I remember
---
So here's my thoughts.
---
I played in Vanilla (no cross realms) on a high population server and the queue times were like 5-15 minutes on most days, but wasn't uncommon to wait 30 minutes. When you played as a premade team, most of the time you were playing against non-premade teams so it made honor grinding easier because you're taking coordinated team vs uncoordinated team.
---
The other thing was that it made the PvP a community based thing because you saw the same names, faces, etc. all the time. So people built up reputations and both Alliance + Horde had contact with each other so we used to setup mini-arena tournaments. We would also do premade vs premade groups and you basically got to know everyone on both factions. You would have rivalries between different classes + specs to see who was the better player.
---
Once cross-realms hit the scene that was the end of the coordinated PvP stuff because you just hit a button and you'll be playing on teams of people you would never see again. That was somewhat brought back with the arenas in BC.
---
Also, for a short while there was a mod (I guess a cheat) where you could queue up an entire 40 man raid to AV.
---
Ever since MoP, or to an extent Cata, people have praised the cinematics in important quests. I *always* fucking hated it. The WoW art team is fantastic, but I hate watching a Jenky shuddery camera pan of something unnecessary with every other quest.
---
Side tangent, but you touch on the reason I get a pit in my stomach when I resub. I’ll be excited to try out the *new* that the xpac has to offer, but there’s clutter from *every* expansion trying to shove itself in my face the moment I log in. I can’t keep my quest log organized and slim, my bank situated, or just get my toon in a comfortable place. There’s just so much clutter. If I went to go try out BFA to see what the hype is all about (lol) Id have to spend a good hour going through my bags and bank, just DELETING shit from the last few expansions.
---
I bet my main has clutter from the Timeless Isle, Garrisons, and some shit from Legion. It’s  hard to even point to an item and say what it is, because it’s all just glittery armor tokens and currencies for a billion different purposes.
---
Auto attack timer. Perfect rotation. Good ping. Pet management. Hunter has the most "difficult" rotation in vanilla. You weave your Aimed shot/Multi shot when your auto attack is on CD.
---
Relatively speaking it's actually better for palas than wars. The only problem is that palas suck balls. When  not healing.
---
Im interested. Ill be rolling a dwarf warrior fury spec
---
Uh huh
---
This guy is right, but casuals will downvote anything they dont agree with
---
The 50-60 brick wall always hits so hard. It’s even harder if you don’t like Mara or Sunken Temple. Luckily, I love those dungeons and can farm them constantly.
---
It's this kind of thinking that leads to homogeneity though. I played Horde in TBC. I couldn't give a stuff if Alliance had one more city. 
---
I don't care if one race can be more classes than another. Races should be the classes that make sense thematically. Sod "balance". 
---
It's not even balance anyway. It's just to stop people who'll whinge about anything, whinging. They'll whinge about anything anyway!
---
If they really cared they could just add a troll city in the next expac to "make up for it".
---
The obsession with pointless "balance" severly limits the game's diversity imo.
---
If she is a supportive person, some like to heal and then priest is often played.
---
My gf likes animals and found giving her hunter pet a name and taking care of it really fun.
---
It's been 15 years. Hacking will be much less prevalent. Blizzard will hopefully have tech that allows to check For weird gold transfer accounts.
---
They are the most gear dependant class, the good one are at the top, the bad at the bottom. The difference between a nolife war and a casual war is much bigger than with other classes.
---
We have both casual and hardcore fury in our guild and the casual wars are below our hunters, below me when i go dps with my feral (and no i dont even farm the gnome mace), even below our ret pal most of the time.
---
Depends a bit on her. Mage is pretty straightforward, but it's a role that doesn't change. So if she got into the game and decided she wanted to try something different, then she would have to roll a different character to experience something new.
---
Priest, however, would let her do either DPS or healing which gives her the option of changing to something new as she got more experienced. Healing is the most fun I've had in WoW (and why I'm rolling my priest again in Classic) and it isn't too hard to pick up.
---
One thing to consider is that we're all starting from scratch and vanilla leveling is very slow so she'll have a long time to get used to the class and evolve with it. No class will be overwhelming because the progression is very slow. Plenty of time to learn the mechanics as you go. Yes, some mechanics can be involved but that isn't going to be relevant for 90+% of the content. (For example, healers frequently down-level their healing spells, but that isn't necessary until you get into raiding. Not likely for a casual player for a very long time.)
---
I'd say have a conversation with her and go over the core class concepts (warriors wear plate and melee enemies, mages use magic to blow up from a distance, hunters use a bow and have a pet, etc) to see what she likes.
---
What can I say, it's a good game. But I don't do most of the "fucking around" I used to do. I mean I did it for a hour or two and it's just boring. I just raid... basically like retail in that sense.
---
I think you’re entirely wrong. I’d say that *we* are in the slim minority. Most of the people will be casuals who take years to get to 60.
---
When the lead developer of the most successful private server says that most of their data was made up, I'm inclined to believe him. Facts hurt, don't they?
---
I just did MC with an ele shaman. Was he top dps? No. But he was in the top 10 and brought WF/str totem to a melee group. Not to mention the off heals I saw him throwing out.
---
We also had a boomkin and shadow priest. We did fine until our tanks got a gear check on Rag (not enough FR).
---
My point is theres no reason to pass people up based solely on their spec most of the time. Obviously composition is important but good players are good players.
---
Nice work !
---
DPS tends to be the easier, more fun role. If you tell people you need DPS, you'll get plenty of volunteers especially with experienced players.
---
Real talk - It's been years since the change and I'm still not used to Orgrimmar changing. I'm really looking forward to going back in Classic to the city that didnt feel like a confusing cluster.
---
As far as I know. It's legit vanilla. No overhaul in graphics or anything. Maybe a bit better scaling from what it looks like on the beta but that's about it
---
Classic will be using classic graphics. That includes animations.
---
There's a chance they'll allow you to toggle new stuff on but that's not confirmed.
---
But making people miss boats or zeppelins tho
---
All the ninja raiders!
---
Hahahahaha. Good one. Good troll.
---
Leashing wasn't a thing in Vanilla so I'd assume it will be so in Classic. They've not outright stated leashing is or is not present, but they've repeatedly stated they're attempting to recreate the authentic 1.12 experience.
---
Thank you holy shit
---
I've both played vanilla and Pservers.  
---
Yes I agree with you that Pservers are an close emulation of what the original vanilla was.  
---
But even Blizz developers have stated that the numbers in Pservers are not 100% accurate.  
---
Which doesn't matter, because even the Pservers where fine and good to play.  
---
This treath started because the original replier was stating, because "x" works on "PServer" it should work on Classic. I don't see how you can make that assumption and be serious. But i got downvoted into oblivion by angry kids i think.  
---
Most of the Pservers had an awesome developers team behind it. which made some QoL changes.
---
You can debate if those changes are good, but that was not the point of the treath, the point is, if something worked on Pserver  it doesn't automatically means it should work on Classic is my statement.
---
It's more fun with the downvotes anyways
---
Basically yes.
---
The standard CB/Prep PvP spec works perfectly fine for this, so if you enjoy PvP this can be a good way to pay for those respecs.

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built from a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For: 
---
High Need
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Priest
---
    Healing:
---

     -  Mage
---
     -  Warlock

     -  Rogue
---
    Healer:
---
     -  Druid
---
Low Need
---
     -  Hunter
---
    Tanks:
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. 
---
Looting Policies: 
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. All items of epic quality will be distributed using loot council.
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

Perma ban anyone that buys or sells gold, including the whole trading a wow token for classic gold thing people keep harping on about. The brave cheaters will still buy gold and might get away with it but it sure as hell will prevent most from doing it if it means they get perma’d when they get caught.
---
I’d say that’s the best way to launch BC. Start a fresh Vanilla server with giant red letters that say THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE SERVER THAT WILL ADVANCE TO BC. Let that server live it’s life until a year or so after Naxx drops, and then give people an out, let them transfer to the original Classic servers if they changed their mind or missed the red letters. 
---
And then one day, *just like in 2007*, BC launches and the world is exactly like it was. No dead 1-60 world, no character copy buggery, just an old fashioned transition.
---
Will it still be possible if they use the modern engine ? I mean AI will use a better path to reach the player, no ?  
---
Reaching King is a clever use of game mechanics : feign death, inv potion, eye of the beast etc..
---
But killing Gordok is more a AI "abuse" no ? They may even fix it without telling us...
---
I remember what I did in order to buy my lvl 40 mount was I ran around collecting herbs for hours and I sold them on the auction house.
---
&gt; Same goes for all flat secondary stats, you can't have a level 58 trinket being BIS at level 70 still... 
---
That is one of my favorite aspects of itemization of earlier wow.
---
GRIND TO WIN
---
wow, thank you
---
You can. Then how is this bubble hs work? In bubble you are still in combat if someone is hitting you.
---
There's a very high chance that Classic will be great for new players. It's the internet so some people will suck, but most of us coming back for Classic are doing so because we miss the community from Vanilla. In vanilla you could always find help (though you might have to ignore some jackassery because, again, it's the internet). The most important part is to be upfront about what you know. If you post in General chat about being new and needing help with something, I'd close to guarantee that someone in the zone will be willing to help.
---
Requests for help is how I met about half of my friends list in vanilla. The other half was people I grouped with for dungeons. New players will be fine.
---
If the pathing will be the improved, new one, that'll suck and it should be impossible. Not to mention the regular leveling tricks used like jumping across fences to lure mobs from one side to the other with them never reaching you.
---
Warriors will make up a big chunk of lvl 60s but that because they are good in every endgame aspect. No. 1 Tanks, one of the best DPS specc and godlike in PVP group combat.
---
The problem with tank is, at 60 there arent enought for your basic 5mans but the raid only needs 1-2 dedicated tanks so its quite hard to get a spot in there if you dont plan ahead or know the guildmaster
---
God.Fucking.Dammit.I forgot about that fun priest fact.
---
But at least It wont be the one missing the boat because beasts cant be MCd.
---
Need an "classic" android phone theme with these ! :)
---
I meant before 1.12.  I remember it being alot faster than wsg or ab.
---
Fair arguement. But you need to remember they dont have the same code as back then. So the demo was really just a place for the pserver players to check everything out and call out mistakes. From my understanding.
---
Yeah, just bring some healing gear. Even enhancement can heal fine in dungeons up until the mid-50s (maybe later if you know what you're doing). You'll drink a lot, but you'll be fine.
---
As someone else mentioned, there's a good elemental build that goes far enough into resto to be useful. It's what I'm planning on doing with my shaman and I expect to be able to heal any dungeon content without a problem.
---
He's saying you couldn't cast astral recall in combat..
---
You can cast Hearthstone in combat. Astral Recall is like Resurrection--you cannot use it in combat.
---
As a rogue, I did a looot of pickpocketing and careful selling to get the gold I needed. The biggest factor is only training certain skills--those will be the biggest gold expenditure by quite a lot unless you're gonna splurge on a nice new weapon in the AH.
---
Glad you are interested. Shoot us an application or join our discord if you have any questions.
---
Tryhard guild stack 20+ fury to get the server first or speed run record. For farm raid, its mandatory for each player to have 2 alts so that they can split their warriors into 3 raids so that they can gear their main roster.
---
I remember seeing it but had no idea what it was for. I donated a few bandages to see what would happen.
---
Oh you are right! I’ve never done the firelands either, in 14 years of play no less, and the reason? Why, the only reason I could see to do it was some arbitrary achievement popping up. Perhaps if they made it Two pop ups I’d be inclined tho! 
---
Fuck all that, and dude it being a record keeper is not a redeeming trait, it’s literally the problem.
---
2008: 11 year old fag with barely any video gaming experience (except Pokemon) and the mind of a 9 year old (or even worse)
---
Now: 22 year old university student guaranteed to skip two weeks of classes when classic hits
---
You are preaching to the choir, friend :)
---
what. 50-60 is so fast you don't even remember doing it. I think you mean 40-50
---
Go on a pserver and roll a class/spec that you're curious about but don't think you want to commit to in classic. You can figure out if you like it or not.
---
Same, I love dungeons to be honest. Im prolly running priest/druid/pally so Ill be healing at least. Im excited to get past lvl 18 so i can start lol
---
Let me specify: there are playable durotar orc warlocks. That contradicts the lore and the whole Thrall campaign.
---
I’d say the *obvious* choices are Vanilla, BC, and Wrath. Those were the expansions when the subscribers grew, instead of every other expansion where they shrunk. 
---
That being said, if Arthas has been dead for a year or so and people are clamoring for Cataclysm, I’d say bring it on. I won’t play it, but if people are sick of BC and Wrath and want Cata, we can’t “wall of
---
No” them. 
---
However, I’d also argue that MoP and beyond, are more or less identical to the way they operated back then. Maybe toons are *slightly* overpowered, but if you do Siege of Orgrimmar as a level 90, chances are it’s pretty close to how it was.
---
Meanwhile, you can just watch a Project 60 or Project 70/80 raid to see just how broken it is. You can virtually solo heroic 5 mans without being an expert like Mione.
---
TLDR: BC and Wrath are obvious choices, Cata is a maybe, but MoP and beyond are kept more pristine in the modern game. Still, I’ll never support a wall of no for any expansion.
---
Jim Sterling, a previous game reviewer now turned YouTube critic says it best, and also calls out the shitty working standards in the industry. There are many others thankfully, and if enough gain traction and people realise what’s at stake, perhaps things can still change. Sadly, it’s not likely.
---
Was gonna say, you could probably play through all of it in an afternoon.
---
Isn't the entire point of them using modern system architecture that they supposesly have the security to handle these issues all sorted out now? (As opposed to making a patch for their actual Vanilla backups).
---
I did.
---
My friend talked me into playing Vanilla WoW as a Shadow Priest and I leveled 1-60 as a Shadow Priest only to be told to heal for raids so I switched over to a healing build. I remember in the first guild I joined to raid MC the guild leader blew up on Ventrilo about priests putting Shadow Word Pain on the monsters.
---
Druids, Priests, Shamans, Paladins, etc. were all basically forced to be healers in most guilds and the gear you got from raids forced you down that path. Same deal with Warriors being tanks.
---
This started changing in the 2.0 patch where things like Shadow Priests could give their party mana based on their shadow damage output so sticking a Shadow Priest in the same group as the healers was suddenly good.
---
BC is what changed things completely though which made just about every spec viable. Paladin + Druid Tanks in Vanilla? You'd get LAUGHED AT. In BC? They were AWESOME.
---
So it's going to be hard for people going into Vanilla with the same mindset as modern WoW where every spec is good.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [H][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website. We also have candy.
---
Eh, you'll spend more time leveling mining enough to farm the mats for that than you would just farming the gold. If playing at launch, you'll get much more money from skinning than mining if you level one of those along the way. Skinning also requires less time to level because you don't have to hunt for nodes or fight with other people to get them.
---
I'm not saying it's *wrong* to go mining. But I do think that skinning and farming the money to buy the stuff you need for engineering is the better option.
---
My bet is that we get the release date after blizzard sets patch 8.2 release on stone so they don't cannibalise each other too much. Prolly early August.
---
that's a bummer, used to be able to do some really crazy stuff with the vanilla wow Scripts. I remember on my priest being able to Target anybody below a certain percentage of Health and cast to heal on them that was within range. It was super easy just binding this to one of my wife's keys that she would press every now and then to put a Renew on my warlock while we were grinding
---
Playing on private servers maybe 1 in 10 hunters could do significant Dps
---
It's an exciting time for games to make a revolution too, the development tools and distribution methods have never been both higher quality and as accessible as they are right now.
---
Awesome!
---
If you get hacked in 2019 you deserve it honestly.
---
The rest of us with more that 3 functioning brain cells to go through 8 different layers of bullshit just to log into things and people are still dumb enough to fuck it up.
---
I mean... 40-50 is literally faster to do than 50-60. I get that it gets more exciting as you near the cap and become more powerful the time goes by quicker. But 40-50 also has more entertaining dungeons IMO.
---
I can run Uldaman, Zul’Farrak, Mara, and RFD on repeat. Plus the zones are great, Tanaris, Hinterlands, Searing Gorge.
---
I dont know what ill need these for but im sure ill need them eventually haha. Thanks my man.
---
I’m not sure how fast it is by doing all the quests. Anecdotally I find those turtley games taper off on Rep once people are unable to clear anymore towers and what not.
---
I was rushing for first 100. I didn't even know some servers were down.
---
My server was fine--just some lag. Garrison system was pretty dead though--instance server spam in chat.
---
Obligatory Monty Python clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E)
---
Meet Boarletics, my boar-locked ultimate ironman...
---
I’m looking forward to healing in Classic, but I really want to get some decent tank gear, just to have fun in 5 mans and maybe Zul Gurub. I’ve seen some monster Pally tanks in ZG.
---
He's talking about leveling ease. Paladin has next to no downtime and a metric ton of survivability. And since it's vanilla, everyone presses the same 1-3 buttons, Paladin is no exception.
---
How much spirit and armor penetration will my holy/prot/ret hybrid paladin need?
---
I joined a pserver around januar/febr. Hit 60 a few weeks ago, ive already been in AQ20 and ZG, got my raiding gear. I was afraid that by the time I hit 60 classic will come out and the server is gonna die but it turns out I still have time. Naxx will come out in 2 weeks and my guild is only at BWL now, so it's unlikely I will get there or AQ40. But I already got enough enjoyment that I won't mind if my character dies at the end.
---
Please stop spreading falsehoods. Everyone knows that private servers were never actually capable of releasing a stable version and we've just been hallucinating the entire time.
---
I do not have any use for these, but I can see how other people would! Felt I needed to comment to show the love
---
D3 was done according to the spec though. It was a shit spec based on a shit vision but it was still released "when done" :/
---
The last few expansions that used Sharding have had really smooth launches. Classic uses sharding during launch. So atleast the first 10 or 20 levels are mostlikely going to be smooth depending where they draw the line for sharding.
---
In that case, it should've been called beta, alpha or whatever but when you give me a demo of an old remastered (not exactly but I don't know a better term for this situation) game I'm going to judge it like a demo. Not a beta test. That was the best they could show the audience and I was disappointed how inaccurate some class mechanics were which leads me to believe it was rushed.
---
Go Alliance, we are pretty cool guys and don't live in mud huts.
---
The new animations were very dependent on the new models, which we know aren't a part of Classic. (I'm assuming you're talking about ability animations)
---
I'm just going to quit my shit job when Classic comes out, then pick up some other shit job after I get to 60 lol.
---
I have to disagree. 50-60 is faster than 40-50, once you hit 50 a lot of zones open up and you become loaded with quests, and when you know what you're doing (order) each level is about an hour and a half. It has nothing to do with excitement as you suggest.
---
the best thing for hybrids to do is find a guild because most pugs are toxic to them the second the moment a hybrid steps out of his healing role.
---
On the fresh server assuming you'll play from the launch, no one get much money or any money at all, so hoping to make decent gold selling boes is a false hope. 
---
similary selling herb or copper. leveling on a well developed established server an a fresh onу is a two different things, in terms of ah.
---
I would love it personally. Hope they don't.
---
Rogues OH speed is important because of poisons. Also trash blade proc duplicates any attack not only autohits.
---
I’m renting the DVD’s from then still
---
Rank one? That’d be shit heals tho, right?
---
Tokens can’t even be traded in retail, only listed anonymously on the AH
---
As for trading classic gold for retail gold, 99% of people trying to do this will be scamming. Once somebody hands over gold on either, they are just going to get blocked and receive nothing.
---
On retail I basically played whatever faction had the cool looking race I wanted to be. Worgen rogue and Goblin shaman were spoke to my soul. Vanilla is much easier. I want to play a rogue and a shaman again, so horde it is.
---
Because it's pre-raid?
---
One strong reason against Xmog. I mean, it’s fucking funny to get obliterated in 3 shots by somebody dual wielding fish, but you should be able to look at the enemy’s weapons and know what to expect. A soft, slimy, fishy slap to the face and not much else.
---
No you didn’t
---
You should stop being obsessed with "BiS" and rather enjoy the game if you actually manage to get that weapon.
---
That being said, 2h enhancement shammies greatly benefits from this weapon. Arms warriors and rets can also extract great value from it, even if its not the theoretical best in slot for either.
---
We're getting the 1.12 version of the system, though.
---
Please stop talking put it your ass, thanks.
---
Almost no heal from the original spell + whatever amount of+healing you have on your gear and literally free manacost. So, it's heavily dependant on your +healing stat amount on gear.
---
Just make friends with lots of ferals
---
Ok I did not know that. I still think Orc warlocks fit from a class fantasy point of view.
---
Lets see, theres a title, mount, a storyline...
---
Its not always arbitrary pop-ups as the sole reason to do content.
---
Theorycrafting wasn't a thing until BC, yeah... and it had to do with mmo-champions website becoming popular. 
---
Honestly most people didn't know what they were doing in Vanilla. You would pick which was the best cookie cut spec and look at the damage meters.
---
/slap
---
It is definitely best in slot for anyone using a two hander until dark edge from Cthun
---
How long and the extent to which sharding will be used.
---
I would lean towards Shaman that way you have the option to do something other than DPS if you so desire.
---
it's fine until you start hitting expansions because it becomes impossible to balance loot, and people complain that they don't get any upgrades... Heck look at how many times people complained that a "harder" raid gave inferior loot or that new content didn't feel like an upgrade.
---
I'm also not sure how much you would've loved the fact that you wouldn't get an upgrade after levelling 10 more levels, clearing heroics and raids.
---
Getting upgrades when you finally got to the point of doing a dungeon was always super fun, getting upgrades once you finally progressed a raid tier was super rewarding you would be a liar liar pants on fire to deny it.
---
Being fun isn't enough incentive for you? That's pretty sad honestly.
---
It wsnt for testing purposes (at least primarily).  It was to show a barebones version of the game to show the concept.  
---
A demo doesnt have to be an explicit final version of a game with only the first little bit of the game available.
---
I really hate UC. It's just garish, and annoying to navigate.
---
Unless it comes out in September, which is part of Summer (at least the first 2/3 of September.)
---
With Dire Maul being pushed to Phase 2, is it worth going Warlock as first char? The satisfaction of having the mount and riding skill from the quest was really a big reason for playing Warlock for me. I just dont know if I want to wait X months with a lvl 40 mount.. (because buying one would be redundant)
---
The whole arc of Thrall is about moving the Orcs away from the dark magic and evil ways back to the old shamanistic one. That is why there are no warlocks and no dark magic in the playble Orc faction in warcraft 3.
---
Nah correctly played hunters do sick dps in mc. They have the hardest dps rotation though as they have to weave auto shots. I've also heard if you time it really well you can get pretty good dps increases from getting Raptor strikes in as well. They are the class that scale the worst with gear in the entire game though, so they start to fall of pretty hard after mc.
---
Huh? How? U couldnt have horde and ally on same server
---
I did but ok
---
You. I like you and I like this post. Especially since you don't subscribe to the lie that is **semi hardcore**.
---
Semi hardcore guilds are people too stupid to realize they are casuals, or "hardcore but don't have time" guys who want the best of the best out of their guild and raid without putting in the real work. And then finally  you have the real hardcore players who could easily join other hardcore guilds but stay because they get loot first. These are the ones who drag the rest through progression, kicking and screaming. 
---
I've been many a semi hardcore branded guilds, and it's always the same shit.
---
It being delayed / coming out at the *end* of summer. Now I have it in my head, I can't get rid of it.

Can't wait for classic Wow!
---
I didn't have problems getting enough gold just by vendoring stuff and not wasting gold on unnecessary things.
---
You could on PvE servers. Not on PvP though.
---
2005 : 19 year old kid out of high school taking college courses. Had bad social anxiety issues.
---
2019 : 32 years old. Small IT business owner and game host for another game (I quit playing Wow at Cata launch). No more social anxiety issues because playing WoW helped me overcome them. Sitting on audio chat every night for years was like therapy.
---
Yup, both replies are true, I forgot that shaman's spell astral recall can't be cast in combat. Unlike hearthstone.
---
That's not true. BFA had major problems on release on some hi pop servers, where you couldn't even log in on release data and Auction house was severely lagging for about a week.
---
I need to know if there is going to be a Classic RP-PvE server with server time being set to US Central time zone. (basically a Classic version of Moon Guard.)
---
(no I'm not one of THOSE people from Goldshire)
---
Are there any Danish-speaking guilds currently forming or having formed? We’re a group of 10-15 people trying to test the waters. Primarily casuals, who will do PvP and PvE.
---
I'm gonna do it anyway.
---
If you're a Ret Pally and you're not the GM of your guild...you're doing it wrong  :)
---
You can with two accounts.
---
cool, now I can make a drinking game where we go thought all the spells and drink if we cant remember the name.
---
I appreciate your opinion and I agree. I see a dodgy kebab video, I dislike.
---
Top Quality.
---
I really like the tele/portal edits on this, covering both factions.
---
- Exactly when in summer?
---
- Exactly how long for Sharding, and in what zones?
---
- Pop caps? Vanilla was 2.5k-3k in most circumstances, is that going to be maintained?
---
- Does the "free until level 20" offer on Retail extend to Classic? Major implications for PvP servers if so.
---
Star Shards. 'nuff said
---
Damn you have to be a no lifer to do all this
---
Me and a few friends will be playing when classic launches, and would like some advice on which starting composition is more viable if our target is hitting 60 and doing some dungeons at our own pace.
---
We will be playing horde:
---
* i would like to be rogue (never played wow except very rarely on pservers)
---
* one friend is pondering between shaman and priest, leaning towards shaman more (played shadow priest in BC)
---
* our third team member is more adaptive, he could play warrior or druid, but mostly something that makes the team work
---
We are not hardcore minmaxers, but would like to level together and also to have a shot at least at the 5-man dungeons. This means, that we could be slightly more effective when dungeoneering, if the missing 2 spots are for roles/classes that are more popular/easier to fill in with via LFG chat.
---
Taken these things into consideration, can anyone give us some suggestion, and more importantly with a short breakdown as why would that configuration be optimal? thanks
---
Kazzak and the dragon world bosses got leashed during vanilla.
---
Minor beastslayer for the glow
---
Enchantment Shamans were the bane of my priest in PvP.
---
For example Drakkisath at the end of UBRS can be kited away from the adds by a hunter while the rest of the raid kills the adds. Then you can just focus on the boss itself.
---
TLDR;

Backstory: I'm currently in my mid-late 20s, and I started playing vanilla back in 2006. I made a night elf rogue that's still my main today! Since I started playing toward the tail end of vanilla, I never fully experienced the raiding scene back then. I killed a few bosses in MC, Ony, AQ20, and ZG in PUG raids before TBC came out but that's about it. My real raiding experience came in TBC. I joined an awesome guild that cleared all raid content, had multiple server firsts, and cracked US top 250 all with a fairly light progression raiding schedule. I was also an officer in this guild so I do have some leadership experience. I kept raiding with these guys through WotLK but as things usually go, a lot of the original members fell off and changes to the game were killing my enthusiasm for hardcore raiding. Since the end of WotLK I've played pretty casually, but classic has sparked my interest in getting back to that level. 
---
**THE IMPORTANT PART:** 
---
The thing I loved most about that guild is that we were able to achieve hardcore goals with a semi-hardcore mindset. We raided 3 nights a week for 3-4 hours max. We didn't take ourselves too seriously - the atmosphere was fun and relaxed, but we focused and got shit done when we needed to. There were no edgelords/trolls or mean-spirited people who caused drama and distractions. If someone was missing an enchant or consumable, we helped each other out instead of calling each other out. This is what I'm looking for in a new guild. 
---
My goal is to clear ALL raid content and to experience what I never got to experience on my rogue. I'm pretty sure I'm going to roll a mage this time around just to do something different, but there's a small chance I'll go back to a rogue again. If this description fits the type of person you're looking for, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks for reading!

Am I the only one that ever reads the quest text and enjoys the story lines?
---
Okay, I think we have a problem of different standards here. I judge Blizzard like a successful and rich company that showed me in the past it got the things done and products were polished. That wasn't the case at all with the demo. I'm not giving a pass to a company of such caliber. If they fucked up I'm going to call them on that because they surely got the resources to do better and didn't bother to use them in order to get the old "Blizzard polish" for a demo.
---
I can see that with some of the newer, more expressive emotes (stretching, mouths more wide, bigger eyes, exaggerated arm/leg movements). 
---
The whole game looks more "toonish" now, which could be a good or bad thing, but it's definitely a sharp contrast to the grittier/rough looking Vanilla models.
---
...
---
It's pretty obvious people like OP are trying to schedule off for release day/week.
---
Jesus Christ. Imagine complaining about an insanely early demo that was literally just proof it concept. Sorry you got baited into spending money on a virtual ticket just to play a proof of concept demo but god damn how can you expect it to be perfectly classic. Did you watch any of the presentations they gave on how the game was being ported? All the issues they still needed to fix? The demo was literally just to show that it was indeed possible to do what they wanted to do and to highlight some of the progress.

Not only that... but the idea that you have to be IC 24/7 is fucking ludicrous lol. I swear people on this sub that try to explain rp have never been a part of rp. No one is going to yell at you if you’re a Druid and leveling OOCly and killing animals, wtf? No guild EVER that Ive seen and Ive been on rp realms for 12 years have done that.
---
Horde has UD and Tremor tho.
---
What race are you going out of curiosity?
---
Loved how Eddard tried to talk Bobby down on the Targ hunt.
---
While I agree this extent of “etiquette” teaching is spewed from shitheads typically...
---
I find it hilarious you think you’ll stomp anyone from the safespace of your guild.
---
Just hide amongst the fodder and farm your consumables while ‘maybe’ getting a piece of gear. Dork.
---
Bind all spells. Never click abilities.
---
I am worried about people realizing all the flaws of classic after the novelty wears off and they no longer have the enjoyment to play the game. Hopefully that doesn't happen too quickly. Else we won't get Burning Crusade.
---
/s ?

Diablo 3 wasn't rushed, it was just announced too early.

**What we offer:**
---
* A transparent loot council system based on raider preference and guild needs, with item priorities published ahead of raids in a viewable spreadsheet
---
* Experienced Vanilla leadership and raiding strategies
---
* ThunderCats theme song before raids
---
* A community for vanilla wow beyond raiding
---
**Join us on discord:**

Yeah, it's been noted - although if they were always planning that, it seems silly to have ever said "summer 2019" in the first place.
---
so beautiful
---
Stop asking for a release date. Its not healthy from a development point of view.
---
There's always someone who wins lottery, doesn't mean playing it makes sense. Enchanting tips will make a lot of money for very few amount of people on a server.
---
I mean, looking at Joanas time per level, 50-60 takes significantly longer than the 40-50s. And Joana is someone who inarguably *knows what they’re doing*. 
---
I also don’t really find the zones that open up to be that rewarding. Un’goro is fantastic, as is Silitbus (we don’t know how quests will be in silitbus yet though). Felwood can get you a portion of a level, Winterslring maybe a level and a half. Burning Steppes is kind of sparse. I like WPL but EPL is an aweeeeful place to be, in my opinion. I could never spend more than an hour or two there.
---
Servers! My only fear is ending up on an imbalanced or dead server. With a list of server-names people could perhaps start planning.

**Raiding**
---
Weekly raids start on **Saturday at 1:00pm EST**. We will add a Sunday afternoon raid when progressing in new content. We use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system. For details, visit the About the Guild page on our website. 
---
**Recruitment**

Drop me a line on Discord at Flooent#0115 if you have any questions.
---
which levels do you suggest actually going to the trainer for rogues?
---
Well hitting the reset button and wiping everything to start new, but now you only have the expansion's content and the pre-existing game was made pointless is just as much, if not more of a problem.
---
Vanilla's itemization was more fun than balance, and I'd absolutely kill for a new game with that kind of crazy itemization that also never increased level caps.
---
Disproportionate representation of classes in raids.
---
Early vanilla had very good class representation in raids, however a few things changed over time. Threat generation went up which allowed the threat limited dps classes (warriors) to scale up insanely well, where as this mitigated the advantages of the classes who can manage their threat (hunters, rogues). Increases in raid dps lead to a game where bosses were dying faster, which meant you needed fewer healers and could stack even more dps, creating a positive feedback loop that has trivialized many early fights in 1.12.
---
My hope is that errors in private server numbers around physical resistance as well hopefully an increase in incoming raid-damage which will increase the need for healers will bring us back to a game where boss fights are longer grind-out affairs, not the pathetic experience they are on private servers. This also has an effect of mitigating the impact of world buffs, since if you know you're going to lose a few people every boss fight, the buffs become far less impactful. Increased incoming raid damage was a big part of what kept the number of melee dps in check, since you couldn't stack melee too much or the healers couldn't keep up.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic that the actual database numbers will return the raid game to look more like it did during actual vanilla than it does on private servers, as I continue to suspect that the "new meta" is more an artifact of private server inaccuracies than it is of evolving understanding of what was a very well understood game even at the time, but only playing Classic will tell.
---
Good luck man, you got this!
---
I used these yesterday in my level progression [cheat sheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd3bge/made_this_to_help_myself_while_leveling_mage/ekwannc/)! It would be *really helpful* if you could release a set with the class spells properly named and assigned ( I know there are redundant copies, but come on, we have 1TB+, I can deal with some copies :) ).
---
i dont think they will do a beta tbh. I mean its far to late for that if they want to release in the summer. I guess there might be some sort of stress testing, but i really doubt a beta
---
I don't get it either.  For years everyone crying for an official vanilla release has been complaining about how everyone just rushes to level cap ASAP in the current retail version and doesn't bother enjoying the journey, and now that Classic is coming out, all these people are planning to waste their vacation time bidding nolifing the game to reach level cap in a couple weeks?  Blows my mind.
---
They've said as recently as a couple weeks ago that they're still set for a summer release, so it's safe to assume they're still on schedule.
---
Anyone ever try this in PvP?
---
rogue shaman warrior sounds great for you guys. Each class uses different armor types which helps gearing you guys up,the 3 of you combined can tank, dps, and heal which is extremely useful and adaptable, plus a shamans windfury totem will be extremely beneficial and feel really good for both the rogue and warrior.
---
Also warriors excel with a healer so there's that.
---
I will not move when flame wreath is cast or the raid blows up
---
Lol you are trippingggg.  An hour and a half per level?  So you’re saying you can grind 50 to 60 in fifteen hours?  Film it and I’ll eat my collectors addition box set.
---
Death of an Alliance dog &gt; Pesky Hearthstone attempt
---
Yup. I had the 2 handed ZG mace, Jeklik's Crusher, as an enhance shaman, and it could proc windfury and windfury could proc off of it for a while. Made for some crazy 10-12+ hit swings all at once
---
Well, let's say you take 15 seconds to kill a beast. It takes 5 seconds to skin it. In this case you are losing money by skinning the mob, since you take 33% longer to kill it.
---
Okay, so I'll preface this by saying your third person playing a Warrior is hands down the best choice but it comes with a huge disclaimer. If you guys are on together all the time and will be leveling as a group then Warrior is great, leveling a Warrior solo in Classic is hands down one of the most tedious things you can do since they have next to nothing in the way of sustain so you basically are eating after every pull and they *really* cannot handle more than 1-2 mobs at a time.
---
That being said once they get a bit of gear they become wrecking machines and you guys having rogue/shaman or priest/warrior would be a scary combo.
---
As for the Shaman vs Priest debate I think it really just comes down to what they want to play. Both classes are strong, I think Priest is probably a slightly better healbot and shadow has it's niche uses but Shaman is great and has a ton of class flavor and utility with all the totems.
---
So overall, I think your third friend should go warrior (druid would be redundant since you already have a healer) and just be aware that leveling solo can be tedious but it's worth it at 60. Your second friend should go either Shaman or Priest depending on what he wants to do, and you should go Rogue if you want to play it since it's pretty much the highest DPS class in Classic and is a blast in PvP at all gear levels.
---
That's actually true, they did, after someone kited Kazzak into Stormwind. So the World Bosses will probably stay leashed but nothing else should.
---
This is totally inevitable for a giant chunk of the people who try classic, especially anyone who never played it before. Thankfully there will also *always* be a core group of people who want to play Classic WoW, *always*. Nost **alone** had something like 13k simultaneous at peak, which is what, 10 classic servers full to the brim? Realistically enough for more.
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
I feel like I'm the only person who liked the RMAH on Diablo 3 LOL.
---
I miss getting $$ for real items.
---
Warlocks are still pretty amazing, really with how good they are at farming you could probably just grind gold in those first few months and go right into getting your epic mount on release. I wouldn't be too worried about buying your 40 mount, it's not much gold overall and it'd be very worth having.
---
Vanilla itemization was simply all over the place because even when TBC was released they still had a lot of place holder items, they needed to create tons of content and the amount of items they could hand craft and balance was very limited.
---
Blizzard didn't knew what it was doing when they launched Vanilla, they probably didn't iron out all the kinks until WoTLK they couldn't create items that project that far into the future.
---
So while there were fun items and odd quirks too many items were pointless even in some raids, and many specs were not really viable because of lacking itemization.
---
This was a popular theory until they straight up said it was going to be released during Summer 2019, which November does not fall into regardless of your hemisphere.
---
Me busy! Leave me alone!
---
They've already confirmed Summer 2019. November is not in the summer.
---
I look forward to seeing some of you fill 40man raids while ignoring classes you deem sub-optimal.. Just because the turbo of turbo-nerds on PServers don't run more than 1 druid for MotW or 2 Hunters for Tranq doesn't mean that plenty of actual Classic Guilds, with half the raid AFK or on Dial Up and Keyboard turning didn't clear content fine.
---
Still lock probably, mages are amazing against most classes but warlocks are just naturally strong against mages.
---
At this point I don't believe there will be a beta. There was always a big chance we wouldn't get a beta. It's not like they have to test the quests, dungeons or the raids. They just have to get the scripting right.
---
Human priest has higher healing output due to passive 5% spirit racial.
---
Human priest is better in every pve encounter that doesn't have a fear mechanic.
---
Dear is just more versatile and better in PvP. In a fully optimized alliance raiding guild you would only have two dwarf priests.
---
What facts?
---
Please dont tell me you are this stupid. Private servers err on the side of caution. If they dont have the correct numbers they will make estimates based on available sources such as old videos, forum posts and guides. If these sources give the developers a number (like procrates) between 5-15%, then the developers will go with 5%.
---
We already know for a FACT that boss armor is much much higher on private server among other things. Anyone who did two minutes of research will know that Classic is going to be much much easier than private servers, yet you morons keep believing that something being "different" on private servers somehow means they are easier. We know this to be false.
---
Quite frankly its hillarious watching you folks embarass yourself over and over on this subreddit.
---
I know it's hard to remember.. But Classic isn't going anywhere. There is no rush if you're a few weeks late to hitting 60. Everyone on this sub acts like they are going for World First.
---
Tue true
---
I don't think we'll ever be flat out told population caps, or how long each content phase will run for.
---
Right?  Everyone ITT is so gung-ho to nolife the game to 60 as fast as possible; all that's gonna accomplish is wasting perfectly good vacation time and getting burned out and disappointed.
---
I find it hilariously ironic how one of the biggest arguments for vanilla was how it was about the journey, not the destination, and yet everyone here just wants to powerlevel through like it's the last several retail xpacs.
---
Sorry, what I meant was, that when I hit 60 I will have to wait X months for DM to be released so I can get the epic mount.
---
Don't worry, my Warlock will buy your stuff off of the AH  :)
---
Also amazing that the warlock used the Soulstone on himself, and not, for example on a druid with b-rez. This is the vanilla shit, nobody having any clue.
---
You're gonna be the guy raging on the forums when it's a late September release LOLLL
---
My man, September is still summer. You're playing with fire if they won't allow you to change your date.
---
Can't kick away reckoning though 😈
---
Dude if you think I'm going to read your paragraphs of bullshit you're out of your mind. Go watch the nearly 2 hour classicast podcast where Nano describes these facts in detail. Then come back here and say sorry for being a dumbass and not knowing what you're talking about.
---
They have tremor totem
---
&gt;too many items were pointless even in some raids, and many specs were not really viable because of lacking itemization.
---
I don't really see the first part as a problem. Raiding is not the be all end all of World of Warcraft. And the solution to the second was to add more itemization for other specs, not reset it entirely and start over (with a more simplified version).
---
I think UD is probably the best solo, if you have a healbot then really all the choices become equally good depending on what you're looking for. Honestly it's a hard choice lol
---
&gt;Furthermore I'd say good luck on finding a 5 man that makes it through the fire keeper gauntlet room or even wants to do emp runs...
---
lmao.. People are consistenty clearing that room on private servers with mobs having a 10 second respawn rate. Blizzlike is 40 second respawn (can be confirmed with old videos) so it's not like lyceum is in any way difficult.
---
What are the class compositions for premade BGs like? And what role does each class play for each? (Like I know you have a druid for flag carrier in wsg). Wondering what it's like trying to get into a premade as a rogue or other class.
---
But loot has nothing to do with skill trees
---
I don't think you understand how much work Blizzard put in to get that Demo up and running. Not even 2 years ago, we were being told that Classic servers are literally impossible and there was no way for them to pull and restore a backup.
---
Yeah, some things were wonky on the demo, but it's still a million steps ahead of "you think you do but you don't."
---
&gt;You can always waste hundreds of gold anyway
---
In vanilla I raided as a hybrid ret paladin (21/0/30).  I healed pretty good in raids with a healing set and was the only pally with imp blessing of might.  Do you think a hybrid shaman (0/30/21) could do the same?  I would be missing mana tide, but toss me in a melee group with my imp str of earth and wf totem to boost their dps.
---
Hello,
---
if your friend A is willing to heal, shaman will be the best fit if you play rogue and your friend B a warrior, this becouse of the WF totem is an insane buff on a meele group. if your friend B tank as warrior it will be always easy to find some dps, you can search for caster dps and you all will be happy to dont fight for loot on 5 man dungeons and your shaman friend can wear leather/mail/cloth. once you guys have some gear t1 or t2 you can probably 3 man DM east for gold very easy
---
Are we expecting a beta for Classic? Because I'm not.
---
Personally, I don't buy into the July 16th being fact. Late summer release (Late August or Late September) seems most likely to me.
---
wouldnt it be better for priests to wand in their downtime
---
What does ppm mean in this context? It usually stands for part per millions, but 1 per million doesn't usually equate to 4%...
---
You are being unhealthy towards a game bro
---
Yeah man it will be fine, you can play the retail with lowest details and highest spell details on 2013 macbook pro without any problem :-) Just a note WoW is almost nothing for MacOS to handle in long turn. See you in druids on classic! there is a r/WowClassicDruid
---
Yeah, go plan your vacation based on nothing at all
---
Didnt your mom teach you that spreading misinformation was wrong?
---
Well, we don't always get what we want
---
I would personally never join a guild that is Loot Council, unless you know everyone outside of WoW or are actual friends. You will not be in the clique and therefore will always feel like you're being passed up on loot due to friendships. My guild in Vanilla used Loot Council and I learned my lesson, I only got scraps that no one else needed, never got what I actually needed/wanted. It doesn't help that, to be honest, there was a female in the guild that used Vent and I feel like she in the clique and got female privileges.
---
It stopped around cataclysm, but before that it was this way
---
I always loved Orgrimmar. Fits the theme of the horse well, and I love being able to hang out in the drag where it’s dark and less crowded. 
---
Thunder Bluff and Undercity are weaker though. I prefer the Alliance cities, but I have to say, even the worst ones are great. The atmosphere of Undercity and Darnassus are so wholesome.
---
Maybe they treated the demo as a beta and didnt feel the need for another one after all the input they got. I think July is a little close and Im expecting August release myself. Fingers crossed we get some more info this week.

Isnt thrash blade mainhand in vanilla? I think this is a screenshot from tbc thrashblade which was one hand and not main hand
---
Release date tomorrow, calling it. If there isnt a release date in April, I wont have much hope for July, but I hope I am wrong.
---
&gt;Also trash blade proc duplicates any attack not only autohits.
---
Lol no. If you are going to make such an outlandish claim then provide a source.
---
It is....in Australia? lol
---
Generally people keep Legendaries off of bis lists due to how stupidly rare they are.
---
It’s pretty good for an enh sham or an arms warr though, but it’s so exceedingly hard to get that it seldom is listed on bis lists. 
---
Similarly, you’ll rarely see Atiesh on Warlock lists despite being the best staff.
---
Both OH and MH speed is irrelevant for warr dps
---
Yea, was gonna say... in the demo I was drinking every 4 or 5 solo pulls or after 2 double pulls.
---
Does that have a cooldown?
---
Dal'Rend? Krol Blade? Sword of Zeal?

2005: 18 years old, Finishing High School while applying to art college. Was on and off until my friends wanted to grind up to 60 together. Rolled a Warlock and it was all history. Stopped around WotLK.
---
Now: 32 years old... 14 years later. I have a career, moved in with my SO and have had the itch for Vanilla WoW again.
---
I tried getting back into BfA, but it just wasn't the same. I missed the unique community on each server. I miss barrens chat.
---
It's using a newer engine so it's likely to include updated graphics,b effects, and models.
---
You can alter the files to modern models if you want but no the animations will always remain.
---
Druid tier 1 is good for tree cosplay. Aka Bush Form.
---
procs per minute
---
At least we're not completely braindead like the non pserver players keep demonstrating.
---
If we were going by Australia release, Classic would release in 2029 because of your lag.
---
Tremor doesn't, WotF has one.
---
To those not expecting a beta; why?
---
Doesn't every Blizzard game/expansion have some sort of beta? Why would classic be different? Yes, it's an "old game" but there's *plenty* that can (and probably will) go wrong. Running old WoW in the new client is going to generate new bugs, some of which will only be found when thousands of people play the game at once.
---
Try bloodvenom post in felwwod
---
I'm getting the distinct feeling that they underestimated how much longer they had. I wouldn't be surprised if they walked this back.
---
Orc, most likely, for nostalgia, i sunk 400 days of playtime into an orc hunter. I'd go dwarf for alliance and if I could stand no boots then troll is the minmaxer race. But orc is not far behind with the bonus pet dmg
---
Take note people who want to join a guild: know the loot distribution your potential guild is using. Quite possibly the biggest reason for guild quits are loot drama. I can also attest to this in a few of guilds I was in.
---
Oh, yeah. If you make the attempt and then still can't figure it out that's fair. I thought he was talking about looking quests up without even trying.
---
* Content phases 
---
* Itemization 
---
* Qol Stuff ( Guild Banks, AoE looting etc)
---
* Will Balance patches be the same or will blizzard alter them 
---
* What are there plans after phase 6 and naxx
---
Funnily enough its better for Ret than any other weapon until Corrupted Ashbringer if you are using Chili and Shadow Oils.
---
Not a waste if this is a serious concern of yours
---
Was thinking the exact same thing, even posted it somewhere on this reddit. If the speculated date of July 16th is true, then tomorrow would be a great day to announce it, exactly 3 months before. As for beta, I'm thinking stress test.
---
There is 1 youtuber, hampsterwheel?, that made it sound like they were 100% required for naxx.
---
June, July and August are the summer months (officially at least - I think).
---
3 months of each season
---
Oh yeah the off hand makes it competitive again its so sad.
---
Glad to hear it. I was stuck on this old crapbox I had cobbled together, AMD APU, no stand alone GPU, crashed all the time. Thought I wasn't going to be able to play either. Finally got a decent job and a new build, ready now. Maybe we'll see each other in Azeroth. Hope you aren't Alliance.
---
Nov 2004, was US. in EU it was 18 Feb 2005.
---
It definitely does cover this. But most people don’t have renters insurance.
---
I only did r10 grind back in vanilla and pservers but IMO pservers don’t count. So, you usually start by grinding AV for rep rewards and you can get to r7 or so solo queueing casually. Rogues and druids cap towers, mages and hunters and warlocks do rdps and warriors die or tank bosses. Seriously smart warriors always hang back and look for people out of position to wreck and run out.
---
WSG I played horde side and we ran warrior heavy in mid w a shaman healer. Druid and or mage flag cap and rogue or hunter on d. From opposition perspective paladins were a nightmare as were GOOD hunters. 
---
AB was about 3 capping and holding, and 99% of our premades ran WSG for fast games.
---
Didnt they say they use the new graphics with an ''classic'' setting you can toggle
---
I will be sad if they make it impossible to kite Teremus the Devourer from Blasted Lands to Stormwind on a regular basis.
---
Ok so. Your post above claims Ironfoe has a 15% procrate on private servers despite this never having been the case, and now you admit you dont care about reading peoples replies to you?
---
I watched the podcast. Again. Something being guesswork and estimates does not equal it  being easier. Your complete lack of logic is astounding.
---
**Pendulum of Doom**, STVietnam, moment where enha is viable
---
Yeah at that point, I’d just get the questhelper addon. It’d be *more* immersive of a game than constantly tabbing out for every single quest. 
---
I think looking it up when you have to is a happy medium between just giving up after wasting an hour, and having it spoon fed to you.
---
A lot of people are expecting stress testing but not an actual beta.
---
They already have people testing the game in house looking for bugs and such; i think they will just need the community to test whether they need sharding or increased respawn rates for starting areas.
---
In the Northern hemisphere, Summer ends on September 23rd.
---
Honestly the comically large weapons and armor don't help. Remember when you could discern between cloth and plate armor?
---
Just buy regular epic
---
so this raid composition is a consequence of avialability and not optimal setup?
---
Depends on the semantics of "required". Required in the sense that it greatly reduces the time invested needed for raiding from everyone. Thus reducing burnouts and people unable to attend.
---
Required mechanically for the boss? (as in cannot kill the boss no matter what unless using consumables) Of course not.
---
There is plenty of quests like that some even needing more than 5 people
---
Yes, quite a few actually
---
There were a decent amount of elite quests that typically required at least 2 (sometimes more) players.  Most of these quests were made non-elite later in the game to make it easier for solo players to complete.
---
I don't want to say they were bad. You're essentially saying they should have done more. They cleared the content. I don't want to be required to do more consumable farming because it's possible. I want people to realize they aren't required. You want to go all out? That's fine, but trying to make everyone that way is going to either burn people out or turn them away.

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting all roles for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking being in a guild that formally schedules vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with mature friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
We are Vanilla veterans with full time jobs who are now in our mid to late 30s and excited about Classic.  We’ve played WoW and other MMOs since 2005 at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured.  Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.  To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization.  We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to build a cohesive team of like-minded members.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience.  Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS.  In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended.  In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks.  Please refer to the Charter at [celestialborn .com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) (remove spaces) for the napkin math behind this.  We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience.
---
Tuesdays:  5-10pm PST
---
Wednesdays:  5-10pm PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing a rotating raid attendance schedule.  With just a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system allows all of us to take breaks for real life, eliminates the standby bench, staves off burn out, and provides some measure of roster protection.  As currently planned each member can expect to take a week off about every 5 weeks.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-assigned loot sheet (see Charter for further details).
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are in our founding stages and currently recruiting for most all positions.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at [celestialborn .com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) (remove spaces) and read over the Charter to determine if we’re a good match.  The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading.  May you find your perfect guild!
---
Both are awesome, well played mages are nightmares though. So much CC and mobile with huge direct damage. Plus portals and water
---
Lol no way, especially not for most of the classes.
---
Intuitive game design imo jumps the player right into the action as you say and teaches the player the systems in a way that the player feels they figured out themselves, through their own agency. not being overwhelmed by an excess of cutscenes and what not right from the get go makes it feel less like a game and a more interactive movie
---
There are so few druids that a good resto is a valuable recruit even if you're only bringing 2 per raid. I don't think you would have problems getting in a good raid guild if you're willing to heal.
---
My too low free time :)
---
The Horde doesn’t vaccinate their children.
---
Yes, they're listed as Elite quests. Some of these quests *can* be soloed by certain classes (Warlock) but they're more difficult and tend to require some extra help. A lot of Elite quests tend to be dungeon quests, which you'll definitely want a group for.
---
Also, some non-Elite quests are just generally really difficult for their level and you'll probably want some help to do them anyways. A lot of escort quests are like this, and everyone in the group will be offered the quest when someone accepts it.
---
There are also Raid quests.
---
The population difference isn't that big. Plus you'll have an easier time getting a raid spot than a hunter or druid because warlocks get 3-4 slots instead of 1-2
---
HELL NO!
---
No. They will be using classic models and effects. They confirm in the Blizzcon discussion video on YouTube
---
Where does this drop?
---
gimme gimme
---
The server stability issues is enough to make me agree, but on the other hand getting even remotely ahead of the pack makes a gigantic difference in your leveling speed and quality of life. Plus being able to monopolize resources such as devilsaur leather or lotus for a few days before everyone catches up is gigantic. Sadly leveling on a new server is kind of one of those all or nothing things you are better off playing an insane amount to get ahead of the curve or playing very casually to get behind the curve.
---
sick wallpaper
---
the double fisher
---
Honestly the AQ event is an awesome time to level. You turn in worthless mats you have too much of (peacebloom, linen bandages) and get insanely high quality greens.
---
Because if we start questioning pserver item accuracy, than our achievement of clearing Naxx might also be questioned.
---
Ah but what about aoe mob grinding as a mage?
---
They won’t move all players to TBC. If they do, this whole issue of wanting Classic again will come up. I believe the movement actually started in the TBC era. Would be a cool option to have though, as long as you can leave a copy of your toon on the server you are leaving.
---
You will be fine. Many warriors are not interested in tanking, and the very good ones don’t farm 5s with pugs. Lot of arms pvp wars, and “I only OT raids when I have to”.  If you want to tank 5s and pvp it’s easy to get groups just learn and be patient and you’ll build a community reputation.  Getting to raid tanks harder though
---
well damn.. lol i got so stoked on this.. was just odd since i never saw it.
---
Yeah - they’re often named strangely because a great deal of the icons come from Warcraft 3 and kept the same filename.
---
You got items that you could turn in for rep to the various city factions.
---
As some already mentioned - it's a legendary, not so easy to get. Similarily world BoE epic drops that site lists as BiS. It's better to look at lists like this druid sheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW\_6b\_z0oU/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#) \- where you have lots of items for a slot ranked. It's not common to use BiS-alike items instead the one mathematically BiS but RNG/Annoying/expensive to get. Also those BiS lists are usually PvE focused.
---
On the plus side locks are a relatively unplayed class, which balances it out. 
---
I'm 100% playing a lock when classic launches, but I can see the shortcomings of the class. Being a shadow bolt turret with curses and the occasional banish / important niche with fantastic utility makes you amazing casually but hurts competitively
---
But you do have chunky hobbits running around.
---
Slippery slope fallacy. In any event, we have already established that this version of Vanilla WoW will have a different patch cycle and talent trees than what we went through when WoW originally launched.
---
How can you be sure that 1.12 talents weren't what began the brokenness of modern wow, what is so significant about 2.0.1 other than an arbitrary naming convention?
---
I won't hold my breath but it will be awesome to see if people will create anything new with ytmnd
---
Rend no because it just isn't worth the rage. Deep wounds is fine as long as the debuff priority system works, because it was assigned the lowest priority and so wouldn't remove important debuffs.
---
I'm looking at meteorological summer
---
THE GNOME’S NAME WAS JUTY NOT JULY THIS IS THE HILL I WILL DIE ON
---
I know we’re all excited for classic but, the last thing on my mind on vacation is wow.
---
Good Morning Everyone,
---
From my post a few weeks ago and a couple that I posted in the Discord, it seems like there is a **high** demand for a late night PST raiding guild. 9:00p.m.+ weekday raids. I would start one, but I am not 100% sure I would be able to give the time commitment to be the guild master. I can do other officer duties such as DKP tracking and class leadership. If there is anyone or a group of people that would be interested in starting a guild maybe we can collaborate on this.
---
Modern wow rotations feels like you're playing a shitty Guitar Hero.
---
Lies.   After the corrupted blood plague all children of azeroth are vaxed
---
Yep, I've been eyeing tomorrow, too. I figure if it's going to be July 16th (and conspiracy theory aside, it does seem like a very logical date), then an announcement must be coming very soon.
---
Heh
---
They have been on private servers.
---
Are warriors supposed to defeat every other class with no counters? How does this argument even make sense?
---
Well.. your friend is nice.
---
Since Blizz didn't specify which summer they meant, I won't be surprised if Classic is released in September.
---
The one next to me? That was a random player.
---
Nice DWARF you got there
---
Well.. that guy is nice.
---
It probably is! Blizzard had lots of easter eggs and homages to other games that were influences on them. I would be surprised if C&amp;C wasn't a major influence on this RTS.
---
Was this on a PServer or live? Because there is no way you are doing that on live.
---
Would be cool to have the first 3 incarnations of the game. There is a draw to having all those play options, to me anyway. Maybe one day I want to raid the original Nax, hop on my BC toon for some dailies, and then some Wrath raids/dungeons. I can see the risk of splintering the community, and I’m not sure how to combat that on a person to person level, but personally, I’d play the hell out of all 3. They all play completely different.
---
It's not really that good, and the only viable way to use 2handers in raiding is to be a horde 2hand fury warrior. In that case, it's pretty good, usually not good enough to spend the absurd price it costs to make though. It's basically just a meme weapon for oneshot pvp montages on paladins or shamans.
---
Furys only take Deep Wounds so they can get impale. With the amount of Crit a Fury wants, 20% increased crit damage is huge.
---
They don't need a beta anyways, i never got this. Dont they have betas in large part to get feedback for the game? There is no feedback to give here, it's just copying an old game. Sure some bug testing could be useful, but you don't need a beta for that.
---
Is your experience with this on a PServer or live? Because I'm 99.9% sure that it's impossible to get without quite a bit of cloth turn-ins even if you do the maximum number of quests while leveling.
---
No, you do a healthy amount of damage before shadowform, and an absolute shit ton of damage after shadowform. 
---
Mana is the biggest obstacle for priests. This is why it's recommended to use a wand for most of your damage. But if you really wanted to go all out, Mindblast, SW:P, Mindflay, and keep switching between mindblast and mindflay, and no target is surviving. 
---
If you really like solo play, it was actually pretty nice. At 45, there's a pretty good chance you can solo "some" elites. Good for getting some end of zone quests done by yourself without having to spam general chat.
---
Please elaborate?
---
I don't think they'll announce any time soon...
---
Bone reavers edge is better dps overall than hand of rag due to the insane armor reduction proc. It easily makes up for the \~6 dps loss. People don't really investigate enh shaman or ret pally bis weapons bc most people putting in the time to test these things consider them non viable. Untamed blade is also up there. And of course dark edge of insanity and naxx weapons beat hand of rag by a lot.
---
I would assume those 2 swords are probably also stronger on ret than hand of rag. But since shaman cant use swords its possible hand of rag is bis for them until dark edge of insanity. 
---
Just go to classicdb and sort weapons by dps. There are plenty stronger than hand of rag. Also remember 14 ap = 1 dps. So dont ignore the str bonuses.
---
LoTR isn't a game.
---
Warhammer 40k lore? Lul
---
The worst part of the whole thing is it made it so 2h weaps were default Hunter weapons, and increased competition with rogues for 1h weaps.
---
You're increasing farming outside of raiding to reduce the amount of time in the raid. If content is on farm, say only MC out and you're 14/14, i'd rather raid 20 minutes longer due to lower dps than farm 3 hours for consumables.
---
I don't they showed anything bigger than any other class. Relax buddy.
---
you already have berseking rage witch a short CD, i would go orc for sure, 25% stun resist is godlike, plus you have the extra burst damage that will be handy since noone is healing you, plus being an orc just discorage paladins/rogues to try to stun you on skirmishes, as a paladin i would rather use my stun on an undead/troll/tauren than on a fucking orc, plus you have more base str and stamina
---
Mmm.. terminal huh? Sorry to hear that friend.
---
lot's of people strive to get the best item available for their class! Stop telling people how to play
---
Anybody rolling Horde for PvP advantage is in for a rude awakening.
---
All top end organised PvP is dominated by Alliance on PServers.
---
3 Month for a Beta seems to short. Think about all the diffrent quests, spells, items etc. that need testing, they backported every single item and changed the values from the legion one, to the vanilla ones. There is so much stuff that could potentially be bugged. So yeah, my money is on stress tests aswell. 3 Month to test the 1-60 content + the raid content is way to short for a beta.
---
There’s spikes in prices at certain times which correlate to the release of new recipes/items. Aside from the most obvious ones (Greater Nature protection potions in AQ - a surge in ele Earth prices, and Greater Shadow protection potions - needed for twin emps trash/cthun, causes a spike in grave moss/fadeleaf), you have other spikes that can also be taken advantage of. Examples like Firebloom right before AQ patch (due to the release of wizard oil), essence of water before naxx patch (due to it being used to craft the frost resistance pieces), or even just runecloth (tends to spike up before AQ due to the bandage turn-ins for war effort, and then spike again pre-naxx due to people hoarding bandages, and needing them to craft the frost resist cloth pieces). 
---
I would say a good rule of thumb is to hoard all herbs you pick. It’s pretty easy to just make an alt and store all your mats there, and if you see something surge in price, you can then sell for a pretty penny. 
---
Another thing to keep in mind when phases are coming around is the price of righteous orbs (used for crusader and +55 healing enchant). Orbs ALWAYS spike when a new raid comes out. New weapons come in to the game, which means more weapon enchants are needed. I recommend never selling orbs unless you catch the market at a good time or just after a new raid releases.
---
Whatever you saw bruh
---
Shitty cloud servers that can´t handle open world boss fights with multiple raiding parties.
---
In the blizzcon classic presentation there was a side-by-side comparison of character selection screens of vanilla and classic. The character shown in both was a gnome. 
---
One's name was "July", kinda obvious hint.
---
The other was named "Osconty". Armory shows Osconty as a lvl 16 gnome. Also a video of a Patchwerk kill was recorded by someone called "Osconty" in 16th of July, 2006
---
July 16. 2019 lands on a Tuesday, which is a traditional day for releasing games.
---
Also works with the mage trinket that reduces cast time by 20 or so percent. An annoying thing that some mages did what put a herber on follow and whenever he spotted a herb, blink to it and pop the trinket to herb faster. That way the unfortunate sod couldn't get any herbs at all. Very annoying.
---
Idk that chill has the same procrate as shadow but yes.
---
The demo shed a lot of light for them of things that weren't working correctly alone. The biggest need for the beta would be server stability. How many is too many people in one area for the modern server infrastructure? In BFA there were complaints of server stability with so many players fighting in OG.
---
Its like a new year in university or school. 
---
The first days/months its very easy to find new friends. Alot of people, especially people from somewhere else, are searching for new friends. And there also some groups they know from other school, sport clubs what ever. I think its harder to join in already formed (level-)group but its still possible. It depends on what you are looking for. I think if you are looking for normal leveling together probably you wont find someone in an already formed group, better look there for solo or dou players. But if you looking for friends to play often dungeons with, they will be happy to know somebody like you.(especially when you are healer or tank). 
---
But the best chance you have to join a already formed friend group when they plan to create a guild or already created a small guild. In alot small guilds are mostly such a nice friendly cohesion. 
---
Conclusion: Yes, you will find alot of great friends when you want to find friends! Perfect start for new friendships are succesful and fun dungeons runs!
---
Nelf's tear is never going to a paladin before a dps cater. They get rejuvenating gem from BWL and shard of the scale (16mp5).
---
Did you get a chance to roll on any DPS gear in raids? For instance if no one else needed.
---
I'll give you this one friend. See you online
---
Tapping uses your GCD
---
Don't even heal dungeons pre-60 as a holy priest. The entire talent tree (barring a few talents) are massively targeted at endgame raid efficiency. 
---
I leveled 1-60 as a priest, and the only time healing as a shadow got sketchy was like level 58-60. 
---
Otherwise, if people ask, just say you're holy and don't let them see you in shadowform.
---
Sell it, it's Bis for 59 twink ele/resto shamans and holy paladins.
---
During the demo some of the animations were not correct lets hope that gets changed
---
To be fair, the HoJ is pre-BIS trinket for Hunters prior to Dire Maul release thanks to the Attack Power.
---
Mages are easy to level and grind and solo content.   
---
Healers are needed.  
---
Play what you will enjoy playing.  
---
But know that people need heals, and priests are amazing at that.
---
With the whole Osconty/July "teaser" + a Blue post about "enjoying a Classic Summer", do you really think it won't come mid July?
---
I mean, if it comes after July, it isn't a Classic Summer, is it?
---
&gt; Late September
---
&gt; summer
---
Okay?  I never said we did.  /u/Embriel said "Pick a date when you're sure the game will be out," when it's not relevant to the issue in OPs post.
---
Source?
---
I'd say Ironfoe/Felstriker is pretty op for rogue's atleast.
---
Old blizzard standards are way better than current blizzard standards.
---
It took 4 weeks on a private server with 3x more pop and dynamically respawning nodes. It was also much easier to stockpile due to the fact that accounts are free and that you can make as many accounts as you want with lvl 1 alts.
---
&gt;step 1: be in a normal guild
---
But a Normal guild would prioritize Warriors for Ironfoe. 
---
Did you mean be in an Abnormal Guild?
---
However did you clear any content at all ever as a night elf priest?! whaaaa?!?!?!
---

Umm soul link is tight. &gt;,&lt;

**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for **all roles**. Having experience with the content isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary. Leadership roles are available for those with the required drive and dedication. 
---
**Contact**: If you want to have fun, clear content and be a top guild on the server, here's how to contact us:

Miss me with that gating. Enough of that shit on retail
---
It's a high level boe world drop.  It's commonly found on trash mobs in instances/raids though because that's a lot of the high level "farming" of mobs people do.
---
I would assume there are stress testing services available though, but I don't really know enough about that to be sure.
---
The demo was super unfinished though. I mean i feel like getting a bunch of random people to tell them how vanilla was and wasn't is just gonna cause even more confusion.
---
Like what feedback would people even give? The vast majority haven't played vanilla, many have only played private servers, most people don't remember vanilla even, it'd just be a mess.
---
&gt; Seriously smart warriors always hang back and look for people out of position to wreck and run out.
---
When I did AV, if I had 1 healer I could disrupt any turtle with Intimidating shout and killing their healers. If you know you can get 3-5 people to follow you, warriors should be charging in to draw fire and break enemy lines.
---
Yea I mean personally I was always fine with just running around on the 40 mount for awhile, so I'd probably just stick with that until the epic lock mount was released. But if you're heavy into PvP you're honestly going to make so much gold if you do it right that the regular epic mount would be worth the investment. Especially since the epic lock mount will be way more expensive on release due to the rarity of the mats.
---
I was getting so tied up in what class/race to roll - making spreadsheets, comparing builds, etc. I joined a pserver and I’ve slowly been leveling every class to around 20, and going through deadmines with groups to see how a team dynamic works for each class. At the very least, I understand how the other classes work and have a better idea of what I want to roll in Classic. I’ve learned that, IMO, leveling a warlock in this early time is so, so easy even compared to a hunter, which is what I mained in Vanilla. I’m so impressed that I can consistently grind mobs that are 3-4 levels above me with relative ease, and I can even kill a mob 5 levels up if I need to. Maybe this is just that the pserver is easier, but dang the Warlock class has some serious utility. 
---
Last thought: if you’re a caster, you MUST buy or make the level 11ish wand that has like 17.6dps. Far and above the DM wand rewards, and makes leveling a breeze.
---
Bitch, I was called the server's best shadow healer!
---
Bonereavers edge is stronger.
---
you already linked the website now go read the comments.
---
It's an ongoing arms race between Blizzard &amp; the gold sellers - as long as the demand for gold exists, some individual (or group) will always be trying to find a way to make RL money off of it. For the sake of the community, I would rather that Blizzard publicly take a stand against the selling of in-game benefits in Classic.
---
Well, you know that spaculation about 16th of July. As OP has mentioned in his post, it's exactly 3 months from tomorrow and the people that believe that speculation also believe that blizz might drop a date tomorrow.
---
&gt;I don't think they'll announce any time soon...
---
They said "classic summer", which means we will be playing during the summer, not half or the end of it. I am very confident about April, they know the majority of the playerbase are people who work so I think we will get atleast a 3 month notice.
---
Yup, and usually listed as such in databases.

What happens when one faction reaches 100% before the other?  
---
Do both factions have to hit 100% for the gates to open?
---
There are, but depending on server population and the activity at your level, it might be advantageous to skip them. If the server is underpopulated, it's hard to find a group (Based on how modern 2019 gamers play now a days). If the server is overpopulated, you can expect the bosses to be camped, and they're on a 5-10 minute respawn timer.
---
Summer 19 ends on the **23.September 19!**
---
They said "Classic Summer 2019", so not only the end of summer 2019. 
---
I hoped for a 16.july release but I think its gonna be later - **middle of august**
---
BFA has a lot more going on under the hood than Classic likely does. Everyone has a million buffs and effects going on at once in a way that vanilla just doesn't do which leads to servers having to do a ton more work when there's lots of people in one place.
---
While this will happen (50+ friends list) don't expect it to be like back then.
---
I speak from private servers experience where this still happens but one huge game changer had been introduced: discord.
---
You will have a huge list while you level but expect less list once you are in a guild due to disxord chat which sort of brings players closer together.
---
True there used to be TS and Vent. But with discord it's a bit harder to describe.
---
You will see for yourself, so keep the hype going.
---
It will still be a lot of fun.
---
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!
---
Don't buy all skills, farm mobs in certain zones for easy silver (Thousand Needles). There's your 40 mount with no issues.
---
Also, I'll gladly buy all the stacks of Wool cloth for 2s each thanks!

Kiting Gordok is as much AI abuse as was kiting the dragonkin during Razorgore: it isn’t.

&gt;THE GNOME’S NAME WAS JUTY NOT JULY THIS IS THE HILL I WILL DIE ON
---
I'm not saying that your theory is wrong, but when [looking at footage from the Blizzcon panel](https://wowclassiccountdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WOWHIST041-1200x512.png) you can see that the "ty" part of "Osconty" is visually distinct (as in: you can make out that it's a "t") from the "ly" part for "July".
---
 Now, that might be due to some blurring of the footage, but I personally believe that the gnome was in fact named July.
---
Lol wait does that actually work?
---
None of these are easy to get compared to Thrash blade but they are definitely upgrades. 
---
Krol Blade would probably be your best bet for "easy", might get lucky in a new economy and pick it up cheap.
---
have fun sitting on the beach doing nothing.
---
i'll be doing something that has immense personal value to me. that does not make me a child.
---
In my experience Priests tend to have a decent balance of how many people are looking for raids vs. raid guilds looking for priests.
---
Mages, on the other hand, never seem to be plentiful enough for whatever reason. Any raid guild I've joined has been a bit desperate for more Mages. I'm not quite sure why this is, since they're a great class in PvE, PvP, and solo farming.
---
You're the hero we need, not the hero we deserve.
---
100%
---
The economy on a fresh server is really odd. 
---
No one really "needs" anything, since self sufficiency tends to be enough. And since everyone is farming the same things, prices tend to be low on "farmable" items. 
---
To afford my mount at 40, I typically pick up skinning and mining. Vendoring all skinning resources, and trying to AH mining resources. With skinning, at 40 you'll easily have an extra 20-40 gold at your disposal.
---
Sounds untrue since Alliance have more Druids and usually more healers.
---
Will the devilsaur eye class quest be out on release?
---
Depends really on what patch this was.  I don't see any of the group buffs on your bars so I assume this was early on.  When I ran MC before BWL was released, and then during BWL even we had quite a few priests that ran as shadow spec and healed just fine.  Also, we had quite a few night elf priests.  Only 1 dwarf priest in our raid.
---
I remember we had 2 officers in the raid, a night elf priest and druid.. married couple.  They were awesome I loved them and never once thought "wow not a dwarf, not inviting to a group!"
---
Someone compared the numbers from original naxx kill videos to a few recent servers. Bosses on the emulated server had more armor.
---
The july 16 thing is so dumb and I can't believe people believe that theory. I just have my own random prediction for July 12th because I think it would be the perfect time to release it. And a beta isnt necessary, the game has been out for 15 years with the same quests and content which have been fixed and redone over the years, all they have to do is revert the newer changes back to the older changes after all their fixes for the past 15 years. Imagine wanting a beta for a game that has been fixed multiple times over 15 years lmao. If blizzard has a beta its because the childish classic wow community keeps begging for it.
---
In no way is this telling people how to play, its just mocking a specific playstyle.
---
OMG I thought it was just me. I could never make sense in my head of the new Orgrimmar. It just doesn't have any flow or synergy! If I couldn't fly through it, I would be wandering around it for hours trying to find a path to where I needed to be. Hate it.
---
Keep in mind a ton of ppl got a mage alt for gold farming purposes, and they don't really do anything on it rather than aoe grind.
---
Dunno where the info about the abudance of priest is coming from. maybe thats the case on some particular server? i dunno. I wouldn't say there is something special going on with priests. i played a priest on private serevr up to aq, and never felt any special pressure on priest raid spots, i'd say its easier than most other classes, and i rather had some offers to join a naxx raiding guilds when i stopped raiding.
---
Also don't be stressed about finding a raid spot period, why do ppl even think its hard? many guilds struggle to gather and maintain 40 ppl, and happy to take anyone who is consistent and reliable, and appear at times. nvm many guild at early tiers actually cant gather 40 man and do half pug raids, which is quite common. or not fully 40man raids.
---
I played a ton of classes on private servers and never had any trouble with raiding, if i wanted to raid. If you are a good, reliable player and properly geared enchanted etc. you shouldn't have much trouble really. from my experience at least. ok apart from tank's spots.
---
You can level to 60 semi-casually in 3 months, and the raid content in p1 is very easy. I'm not convinced that there's going to be a beta, but if they do have one 3 months is plenty of time to get thorough testing done.
---
Yeah, I’m going skinning/mining on my warrior from 1-40, then after I get my mount I’m going to train up Engineering. And I’m going to level a Hunter alt with alchemy so I can transmute Arcanite and farm DM:Trib.
---
I think WC3 is why so many people have such fond attachments to Vanilla and then BC &amp; WotLK.  Everything that came after just seemed to stretch too much for story lines and plot points.
---
Ahh the good old days of having a whole group of people lying about what spec they are.
---
Is it the one that:
---
1. Doesn't pay it's construction workers, who then go on a riot?
---
2. Is so unprepared for invasion that they destroy the industrial dam keeping toxic waste at bay, leaving 4 out 5 people in the city dead or leprous?
---
3. Gets their princesses seduced by hostile supplicants of an ancient fire god? 
---
4. Somersaults into hiding.
---
Or maybe it's the one that:
---
1. Has fancy ghost wolves. 
---
2. That's 40% movement speed.
---
3. You can literally have a team of 5-shamans do everything pre-raid except make food or water to fuel the carnage.
---
4. I was once attacked by a hunter while underwater, while specced into Healing Focus, so I just healed myself until the hunter drowned. I saw Islen Waterseer later who just gave me the water totem straight away out of respect. 
---
I kid around because I play Alliance and know so little about Horde lore.
---
I did too, but sparingly. 
---
What I was trying to point out is that there are A LOT of warriors who will kamikaze and simply die. Even if you have a healer, you go in, do your business quickly, and GTFO or you'll die as your healer runs out of mana eventually.
---
Warrior PvP is mostly about catching people out of position in a large group, or getting a pocket healer and terrorizing 1-2 individuals. Just my opinion though
---
That does make a lot of sense, I understand.
---
However I am not sure how confirmed is this 16th thing
---
&gt; You should stop being obsessed with "BiS" and rather enjoy the game
---
That's **HOW** some people enjoy the game.
---
so you're saying:
---
"dOn't eNjOy tHe gAmE AnD JuSt eNjOy tHe gAmE!"
---
Yeah... back then this elitist shit wasn't a thing.
---
Those are nost launch numbers, the server didn't even last long enough for the boredom to get set in before the change in ownership happened
---
In soviet Russia maybe
---
Stormwind *and* Blackrock Mountain, don't forget.
---
Yeah, all those hundreds of thousands of players on vanilla pservers that play ritually just haven't figured it out yet.
---
It's almost like people will do things like play retro games they've beaten hundreds of times because they think it's fun. The fun is supposed to stop when you reach the end.
---
It's weird, man.
---
I've been playing on vanilla pservers for years now and I'm still just as excited for Classic as anyone else.
---
All the power to you brother.   I'm not putting down the game or desire to play, hell, I've been joking with friends that his is the second chance I always wanted, kid is a teen now and I'm single!   Wow for days!
---
I'm just saying can we stop complaining about a release date.  I mean, we've won no?   We got what we have been asking for.
---
What next.   We get a release date.   And problem start...  Blizzard, I have some more vacation days, I need to know the date for phase 2.   
---
After that.... Blizzard, I need to plan my wedding, can I know phase 3 date please?!?!?".
---
Those numbers aren't right. In 3 hours you could farm like 15 weeks worth of MC consumables. Surely you mean 800 minutes, not 20 minutes because you are not a selfish asshole who thinks only their time matters?
---
My major concern is the speed BWL and ZG come out. If MC is the only raid for 3+ months I'll either play another game or focus on gold.
---
But the mage trinket has a 5 minute CD
---
Pick the faction you feel more identified with. You should watch this video: https://youtu.be/xACddNKUNtc
---
I was also totally confused
---
Key word is *experienced*
---
Hi all, I'm at work and can't watch the video. Can anyone give a brief summery?
---
It's not toxic pointing out an error.  Hemo is not at 46.
---
Give us all the classes!
---
It's not confirmed at all, it's only guess work from hints we've got from them, it's only a speculation at the end of the day.
---
But if I remember correctly they did something very similar with Cataclysm, they anounced in a blue post something about december and a date (forgot the actual date) and it turned out that Cata was released on that date.
---
Isnt 100g for a consumable stupidly high though? I have no idea how much gold was worth in vanilla, but everyone seems to claim that the 1k for epic mount was a very high amount.
---
It did back in 2005, but only once an hour!
---
My pick for most popular type of guild by a mile this time around, and not even on OPs list
---
Which means?
---
I will probably do the odd arena or RBG. Clear the newest raid once or twice. Might as well do the little things I like since it will be virtually free to play.
---
Just have difficult/expensive upgrade paths for those iconic items, so that those who want to keep them can do so.
---
Perhaps not every expansion but how cool would it have been in Cata to have a resurrected Thunderfury? Paying homage to legendary deeds of the past is usually awesome in games. Of course, they'd have to plan ahead and remove the ability to get each expansion's Legendaries (real ones not legion ones) at the end of the xpac.
---
Good question, not sure at this point.
---
Yes, there are usually a few places in each area that require group work. They are optional, but very rewarding to complete.
---
There were two arguments, and both were wrong.
---
1. "Horde .. can get an Owl faster than alliance."
---
No they can't, there's one in the Alliance starting zone.
---
Then he changed the argument because he was wrong, without admitting he was wrong.
---
2.  Horde can get something with Screech faster than alliance can, at 16th level ... by going into an Alliance zone.
---
No they can't.  It's not faster for a Horde to level up to 16 someplace else and then go to an Alliance zone faster than alliance could go there, be questing, ding 16 there because they are questing there, and then immediately tame one.
---
He's wrong on both arguments.
---
Never again will I be in a hardcore raiding guild. Tried it once, got some great gear but man those guys sucked the fun out of the game and life. There is a hard to find middle ground between casual and hardcore raiding guilds and it's worth the time to find it. Most of the time the best thing to do is work your way up in a casual guild and slowly push it to be a bit more serious. 
---
This post is pretty accurate though. Nice write up.
---
Of course it is. He probably did a lot of premades versus pugs at that win rate. 
---
I was just making a snarky comment that one individuals experiences is not indicative of an entire faction’s advantages.
---
You would be fine. Don't plan on being a PvP God.
---
I got mine in UBRS, in an event that I interpreted as an act of gratitude from the Gods of WoW for helping so many people get their damn BWL attunement on what seemed like a twice-daily basis back then.
---
summer ends in a large part of the world september 23rd dude....3/4 of september is summer
---
&gt; Vanilla's itemization was more fun than balance, and I'd absolutely kill for a new game with that kind of crazy itemization that also never increased level caps.
---
Path of Exile (while a completely different type of game from WoW) has crazy itemization and manages to release new content without totally making previous itemization worthless.

MC and BWL both required heavy fire resist gear. Incant remember but I think at some point they nerfed the mobs so it wasnt as bad though. Not sure what we will see in classic though.

# **Seven Sins  Late Night Guild EU :flag_eu: ** 
---
Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours. Started by a small grp of irl friends to see if there is interest for late night raiding. After some posts here and there seems people are interested to play at these hours so here we are starting the project.
---
\*\*General info\*\*
---
\*\*-\*\*We want to make a semi-hardcore PVE guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
\*\*-\*\*If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
\*\*Raiding info\*\*
---
\*\*-\*\*We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
\*\*-\*\*We will have role officers/Raid leader and at the moment all positions are free for anyone up to the challenge.
---
\*\*-\*\*We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
\*\*-\*\*We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Sun(Thursday or Monday on progression). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
\*\*-\*\*We will either use DKP or loot council.
---
\*\*-\*\*Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
\*\*-\*\*We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
\*\*-\*\*People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord KingMavros#2601

You could instant cap flags in AB with the proc

Well, they were *evil* animals, clearly. :V Possessed by Lord ~~Satan~~ Sargeras.
---
Very engaging PvP class as you have 16 totems, multiple shocks of high and low rank. Constantly have to decide if burning your Mana attempting a quick kill is a good idea or not.
---
PvE you will just be totem twisting. Stormstrike takes up a debuff slot so you won't be allowed to use it.

---
Sharing should last for the non contested zones, imo. Elwynn and Westfall are sharded, Redridge and beyond are not. Nor are cities. 
---
My thought is, nothing looted or accomplished in those zones affects the greater economy very much. They will be the most impacted, as on day 1 everyone will have a goal of getting out of the starting zone or hitting level 20. By the time you get to the third zone, you could run into the opposite faction—if we are building a community, recognizing the names of the enemy starts to become important. Having your entire server get triggered at a ganker builds community, having a rogue in one of the 14 red ridge shards doesn’t. There are 11 uncontested zones, keep sharding active so long as those 11 zones occupy a majority of the most populace zones. 
---
I really don’t have the faintest idea what sort of timelines phases should have.
---
If the goal is HoJ and Ironfoe, you only need a tank, one rogue, and a healer.  Rogue can solo Lyceum very easily.  Despite all the runs I've done across my characters, I've only see 1 Ironfoe drop, ever.
---
Play Horde on their server and make them regret their unwise decision.
---
Scare Beast on an enemy druid in cat or bear form.
---
I don't think everyone is asking vacation time to race to 60. Luckily I can just take vacation time when I want and I plan to take significant time off to play for fun. It's great to be able to sit down and just play for a few (several) hours uninterrupted, then go about errands, come back and play until my hearts content without worrying about tomorrow. I admit I have been taking launch days off since Cata to race to max, only replaying everything "slowly" on an alt. But Vanilla, TBC, and WOTLK I always took my time, this will be no different.
---
Unpopular opinion but as a Scandinavian, I seriously only hope for a late summer release or even fall tbh. We have three months per year with a chance for really great weather ( +20 degrees celsius ). Summer is the time for being with friends out on a boat somewhere, to camp on an island, to have beach-volleyboll tournaments or to play freakin golf. I wouldnt have any problem with no-life'ing wow any other season except in the summer lol :(
---
But I'm still grateful, a summer release is still better than no release so...
---
Considering one of us can mow through you pathetic knife ears like butta. Lucky you.
---
Personally, Frost nova is always satisfying. In solo play, you can use it to freeze dozens of mobs in place, to retreat and AoE. It feels like I’m
---
Playing Plants vs Zombies, and Frost Nova is that ultimate plant that lets me wreck the playing field. Or in dungeons, you can find really
---
clever uses for Frost Nova that make your day way easier. The 5-elite pulls in BRD and ST, you can communicate with your tank to keep 3 or 4 elites pacified at the same time. 
---
Other honorable mentions are Hurricane, 1 min CD crazy AoE
---
Damage, feels good to pop as a healer and wreck the meters. Lastly, I can’t not mention Recklessness. It’s a 30m Cd so it has to be OP, but guaranteed crits for a Warrior is pure crack.
---
Hi, /u/MazhP
---
I normally don't buy into these easter egg conspiracies, but this one seemed so on-the-nose it's hard to deny. 
---
After playing the (very rough) demo I feel like there's a decent chance we will get a beta, but if it's going to be a "real" one (versus stress test) it needs to start like *right now*.

I look forward to grinding out exalted with all 3 again.   Although, not rolling a druid this time around, wsg might take a bit longer than I recall.
---
Swings all around!  -Cpt Jack Sparrow voice
---
Vanilla raiding was vastly different to TBC raiding. I played through every expansion and my only HC Raiding guild experience was vanilla. Those guys definitely have no tolerance for messing around and you were absolutely expected to have consumables. Maybe not all of them did it that crazy but a lot of time was spent gathering items for the guild.
---
Execute on Warrior. "Eat shit and die!" ;)
---
Yeah... as a Druid, fuck ye. But then again, I hate playing a rogue when I can’t sap a bear, so I suppose it’s fair.
---
Jesus Christ that’s depressing. I would have given up! Lol grats on finally obtaining it.
---
Agreed.  No matter how short it is (1-10 only) or how long (1-20), people are going to be mad.  It could be brief (launch day + 1 or 2 days) or it could be the first 2-3 weeks post-launch, but either way, people will be mad.
---
All I want is a confirmation of the plan, one way or another.
---
Yeah I’ve made that mistake on a rogue before. You pretty much nullify my best cooldown, meanwhile my best defense during retaliation is to run away.
---
No one cares about your needs bro.
---
Combo seems a little fishy.
---
They do more than just run around ;).
---
Moonfire spam!
---
It is perfectly possible to enjoy the game and have great fun with a legendary weapon even if it's not the theoretical best. It's still an amazing weapon, and one should be happy to obtain it, not disappointed because it was not bis.
---
And to be honest, all the focus on bis these days are dictating people on how to play the game more than I ever will.
---
"That's HOW some people enjoy the game." 
---
Um no those aren't people. They are cancers. Frankly if their was a way. The rest of us would round those neck beards up and drop them on their own filthy server together.
---
And this is why I kill hunter pets first in wPvP. There needs to be some balance in the world.
---
Man this is what I'm kinda nervous about. What method will guilds be using for loot distribution? I really really dont want to see DKP come back.
---
I would expect a short PTR or something since they'll want to gauge interest and iron out minor graphical bugs like the purple lights they mentioned at Blizzcon but other than that, probably not.
---
They have ALL the data. We don't. What can we really inform them of?
---
Decent caster items as well if Moira kicks the bucket. Pretty good for newer 60s.
---
Bubble.
---
Oh yea, in that instance xD
---
no realm transfer might be good when you think about ppl ninjaing stuff, however i think no realm transfer is a bad idea.
---
thats because at the beginning you might choose a low pop server and without the possibility of transfer you could get stuck there.
---
Thank you!
---
First the entire world map now this! You sir are a fucking legend!
---
Not satisfying for you mana pool though. It is amazing how effective it can be coming out of a form at full mana, and just chunking the last 50% of their HP. I’ve had this backfire though. I spam moonfire, but they pop a huge health potion at 10% HP. Then they turn around and beat my OOM Tauren-form ass.
---
If you make a priest one can you send it to me too?
---
Wouldnt the mace be lvl 60? because of the new scaling stuff.
---
had this on a pserver with felstriker. dropped 2x within my first 5 ubrs runs. sadly won it just 1x
---
The usual rule is, "if it's fucking broken(but fun), then it works in classic"
---
Uhm.... Mirahs Song?! If you are using thrash blade you are just bad/lazy
---
This is definitely misinformation.
---
Dude first off again, you literally aren't acknowledging the fact I specifically said that getting an "owl" consists of getting an owl, and then getting the owl specific ability screech, which is the only reason you want an owl. 
---
Also yes I am saying it is literally faster for horde to get to titirsfal then Westfall, then for ANY alliance race to get to teldrasil then Westfall. Like dude it's not retail, you don't spawn with major city flight points and you have to walk through every zone in between at least once if you want to get from teld to westfall. I honestly don't understand how you are arguing you wouldn't have to do that because you're alliance? It's not like alliance spawn in with gm commands
---
That nice squishy sound too.
---
That’s also the only time an average geared Paladin is ever threatening, when you’re below 20%.
---
I remember when that was a thing, I think blizzard nerfed it in vanilla because I stopped seeing it after a while.
---
&gt; The july 16 thing is so dumb and I can't believe people believe that theory.
---
Blizzard have done similar things in the past, it's not completely out of the realms of possibilities that they set this up. It's a good way to give the community a rough idea, while not officially pinning down a release date.
---
You could be the best player in the world on some classes and not get sub 10 days. The world record on the fastest leveling class is just under 5 days played, and that wasn't on a fresh server. You're gonna be fighting for mobs/quests the whole way through on release in all likelihood.
---
Even blizzlike private servers have dynamic spawning and a few other small tweaks to make leveling more consistent, that doesn't seem like it will be the case in classic barring the early zone sharding.
---
Can we have the same after having the race for gender and race ? :)
---
Welp, gonna go spam BRD Ironfoe for hilarious burst damage meme-spec thanks a lot. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.

*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
There's a list of all the quests giving rep and it adds up to exalted at that level
---
first hit on ony *proccs*  -&gt; instant overaggro -&gt; rip
---
This is so painfully accurate it hurts. People on this sub want private servers to be wrong about everything so badly because they can't stand knowing that some people have years of experience playing Classic already when they don't.
---
That’s when I try to layer 4 flame strikes and a blizzard on top of each other to try to get you in that .01 second of vulnerability, assuming you’re lower level.

* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We will have role officers/Raid leader and at the moment all positions are free for anyone up to the challenge.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Sun(Thursday or Monday on progression). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will either use DKP or loot council.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.

---
thanks for the seemingly unpopular opinion. but you are right.
---
id rather they invest their time on fixing the game mechanics rather than some clunky loot trading implementation. but overall the news is still a win, since they try to respect the legacy of vanilla while gaining the advantage of the loot trading system.
---
No, that's people speculating in this sub.

---
See engineering.
---
They don't read your posts. It's no use making this thread every day.
---
yeah maybe, people did up in aq40 patch i know that 100%, so if it was changed it was the later patches. 1.11 or the 1.12 tbc prepatch.
---
Asking genuinely, then why do so many companies do a stress test beta with the public?
---
Go easy on the weed and you may have a brain cell left to play some wow one day.
---
This is the sole reason anyone levels a priest, right?
---
&gt; Also yes I am saying it is literally faster for horde to get to titirsfal then Westfall, then for ANY alliance race to get to teldrasil then Westfall.
---
Again you are changing the argument.  You're now saying "It's faster for any Horde to get to Westfall from anywhere in Azeroth, than it is for Alliance to get there from one specific point!"
---
Your title was wrong.  You were shown it was wrong.  You changed the argument and again were wrong, so you're changing it for a third time trying to salvage some internet ego you have.
---
Do you like me?

I would like to add that pre loading cor might be worth it but losing the GCD during combat is going to be a dps loss even if you get a garanteed NF proc.
---
Unless ofc it happens during when you got to move and stuff like DC, Sbrun are on CD and you don't have to LT.
---
Maybe not the first big-ticket "satisfying" skill to come to mind, but there's a special place in my heart for Vanish, as a Rogue.
---
In a kit designed to have an answer for a variety of situations, Vanish is the bread and butter.  Engaging in a fight knowing you have that skill in your back pocket to re-open, or escape if things turn south is just a great feeling.

It's the proper OH for DW Warrior with Ironfoe, Rogues can go suck it!
---
I’m a believer in July 16, but I don’t think they *have* to announce a date this week. But it’s unlikely that it’s gonna be announced after April.
---
reminder that daelin was 100% right and did nothing wrong
---
fuck thrall and fuck green people
---
I think people are wary of the "end" of Classic; if it's going to be locked on 1.12 forever or if TBC will be rolled out at some point making Naxx irrelevant to non hardcore crowd again, similar to the end of vanilla back in 06. 
---
I hope TBC does come out eventually but maybe on a "forked" server if that makes sense? So we still get our vanilla server but can progress on a TBC server too? Doubt Blizz will do that but (full private server mode activated) but one can hope :)
---
Awesome info, thank you. As far as where I get the information on an abundance of priests, that's from reading comments in various thread on this subreddit. Since I've never played on a private server I have no idea how true that is.
---
I think I might just roll a mage then! It's the class I've been wanting to play on classic anyway.
---
Source on which server has hundreds of thousands active players?
---
Ah yes, the whoring and the drinking
---
Hey all! Looking to find a guild for Classic launch!
---
* LFG | Alliance - NA - PVP server with PvE semi-hardcore atmosphere |
---
* Looking for a main tank / offtank position within the guild.
---
* Experience includes MC/ONY/ZG/BWL/AQ20/AQ40 (done in past yr on a pserver).
---
* Raid times: I can do the following; Monday night 8pm EST+, Wednesday night 10pm EST+ and Thursday night 8pm EST+.
---
Interested in me? Feel free to PM me so we can chat more!
---
Bare with me here it's been about 13 years now, I just reread all the patch notes from 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. I don't think the threat changes would be a game changer and most people did not grind to Rank 14 for the PVP weapons. You really couldn't PVP enough to hit rank 14 and still raid, also most of the top guilds already had great weapons from BWL and AQ40. The pre-nerf C'thun was very hard and even if you had BIS Naxx gear I don't see anyone defeating C'thun. If you brought more healers your DPS suffered, if you brought more DPS your healers were constantly flirting with being out of range since the room was enormous and you moved around a lot. My opinion is the fight was impossible pre-nerf, I don't start thinking it's possible until maybe you get a lot of TBC buffs and Shamans and Paladins in the same raid.
---
i think mage with ap+pom+pyro would technically be harder nuke, but thats cd based.   
---
i dont think the 5% int, will be a noticable increase if you are just calculating quick burst. in longer scenarios, i think it would matter more.   
---
But since we are talking PVP, orc will be better. Stuns are so devastating as warlock.
---
Full destruction or as people call it, conflag spec, is pretty strong yes. It's very burst with immolate conflag combo and such. This is the spec people usually run for it:
---

LMAO you're literally some virgin 32 year old lurking on the depression and dating subreddits. How sad your life must be. You need to get some pussy and stop being suck a loser in life
---
You probably weren't spamming jump at the same time as moonfire.  As a nelf, every time I did a flip jump, my moonfire was amaze.   Just amaze.
---
That's why i'm a girl and i'm playing Troll and Tauren, they are pretty and cute. Female Nelves were overrated in Vanilla, just because of the stripper dance and the lack of porn in 2004.
---
Kidney Shot or w/e it is from the rogue. The "crunch" sound. I was never a rogue main (had a twink for BGs), but still, you can't forget that sound.
---
Wow a Benediction on a Nelf priest... but I thought the top 1% said MC is impossible to clear without full dwarf priests!
---
Fear.
---
This on repeat from 1 to 60.. Once you reach 60, you're free to play another song
---
It really depends on your class and role. Back in Vanilla I tanked a bunch of dungeons on my warrior. People are always looking for tanks and dungeons typically provide good loot / boe's that you will win with greed rolls, so that was profitable for me. I also had mining / blacksmithing so I sold green iron hauberks for quick profit pre-40. Warriors and Pallies buy those up like crazy during leveling since you don't replace that chest piece for a very long time. You can mine all the materials for them yourself minus the leather armor, and they sold for at least 7+ gold apiece. Get a leatherworking buddy to sell you the chestpieces required for the craft (it's like 20 silver in mats for them to make these) and you can make a hefty profit.
---
Yeah I feel you. I play a low-lvl rogue that hangs out in Redridge. The amount of shit Vanish + Sprint+ Sap + Crippling Poison alone has allowed me to pull off is insane.
---
Especially when it’s a ??, just pop that Vanish, and ninja sap them. You just thwarted a level 60 as a lowbie.
---
Hi John Blizzard here. The release date is the 3 numbers on the back of your credit card.
---
Had no problem getting my mount at 40 on my warrior. Plate and had we axe already too. Just dont waste gold and vendor stuff. I didnt even have professions either. Its not hard to earn gold.
---
Always gave me a weird satisfaction using arcane missiles in classic. The only reason being is I just think it looked very cool and smooth, atleast on undeads.
---
Oh man those were some fun times.
---
You will definitely make new friends just like in Vanilla. Unlike retail, the game is built around making friends.
---
Brilliant. That would solve the problem AND make the nochangers happy.
---
GlassCanon for a reason, very very high burst but you dont have any of the utilitys thats helpful to fight more than one person from the other trees obviously.
---
I like deep desto alot and think its way more fun than to just survive/outlast shit.
---
Superviable in world pvp :)
---
Checked out the website, how many members do you currently have?
---
Warrior hear is way more expensive than hear for amy other class. Lionheart, Cloudkeepers, Devilsaur, Edgemasters, Titanics , T2.5 shoulder mats. The list goes on.
---
Plenty, plus all the dungeon quests and end game raid prep/key quests.
---
Yes it is more going on but if we're talking buffs vanilla would take the cake there wouldn't it? Especially with the city wide buffs and multiple zone wide with Warchief's blessing. With it being a smaller world and sharding (hopefully) only at the start of the servers I'd imagine it would be taxing in a different way.
---
Personally I will be taking herb and skinning for the max gold gain while leveling. Unless I will be competing with a rl friend I will be playing a lot with. Then I might go mining just to not compete with each other. 
---
When I get to max level I will swap out skinning for tailoring. When ZG lauches you definitely want 300/300 tailoring for the Bloodvine set buff. (and prolly swap to herb if I went mining, for the extra gains on dire maul farm runs)
---
It will be weird getting teleported to a different shard when you join a group. It could potentially put you right in front of a mob and in Vanilla that could be a death.
---
Uhh 20% less threat doesnt mean 80% dps ????
---
Sorry i read wrong, please down vote me to the ground
---
First off not all those quests give their rep after revered, and most don't give full rep past friendly. I mean people are more than likely going to try it so we shall see, but I'm almost certain they're going to hit a wall a little under revered.
---
leveling horde is eons easier than leveling alliance (mainly due to the questing, barrens alone is what, levels 10 - 24? and how easy it is to navigate around the maps than alliance) - Zep alone saves SO much time traveling during those 30s - 40s and much better flight paths). But alliance have it a bit more easier after 48-50 with IF being SO close to blackorck mountain where youll be spending a TON of time there and end game.
---
Apart from that - look at the shammy vs paladin debate. Which do you not want to fight against? which do you want in your raids or BGs fighting for your side? do you want to play one of those?
---
if not, pick whichever you want!
---
what is so unconvetional about arcane ? arcane-frost is what most mages use during MC-BWL progression. you only have max 1-2 of your mages specced into winterchill, rest is specced for more dps.

Chain Lightning, no contest. Without a doubt the coolest spell effect in the game. When it crits you genuinely feel like you just sent them to Jesus.

What's a DWARF?

Enhance didn’t make the list. Does that mean it’s raid viable?
---

---
What iconic items the level 58 trinket from UBRS? and you understand that you essentially are advocating for the artifact system right? :)
---
&gt; all they have to do is revert the newer changes back to the older changes 
---
That's really, really not how simple it is. Stuffing 1.12 assets and data into a modern client is going to cause new bugs. We've already seen them, we know they exist, we know they're being fixed. There's no guarantee Blizz will be able to find them all by themselves (they likely won't).
---
Elemental Shaman and Pom/Pyro mage are the two hardest hitting PvP specs in the game
---
lol i agree, summer is party time for europe
---
No RpPvP servers.
---
I have heard ome of the top ranked guilds , Scuba Cops, argue that a 4 druid 4 pala 4 priest healing team is optimal. I think resto druid is underrated in Vanilla
---
July 16th will be the day or two stress test. 
---
Due to popularity they will extend it to the weekend.
---
An announcement will be made to check out blizzon for the release date. 
---
Release date will be December
---
Because there is no way for multiple runs being organized within a 40man guild, or having a warrior who already owns it... jfc
---
How do you know that's how it's going to work? That's certainly how it worked in Vanilla but this isn't Vanilla.
---
paladins hate him
---
Ah, thats unfortunate so we are like fire mages with great burst but none of the survivability. :(
---
Wtb Ret mana buffs
---
my guess is august 20
---
MMmmm Kiting the Pitlord back to town to pillage everyone.
---
Mirah's song was not listed in the comment I responded too. 
---
Also, in what world are you using Mirah's in MH over Thrash Blade?
---
It upset's me that all I want to do is play a ret paladin when Classic Launches but the Meme's have made it so I simply can't bring myself to do it. Feelsbadman :(
---
August and September are summer time.
---
if it's done right, then lower level items being BiS is super cool. it gives you a chance of getting your BiS before you're usually doing it, letting you feel that excitement earlier on. 
---
it's part of why i loved vanilla wow itemization, it made each piece of gear way more interesting and less homogenized. it made it feel like i was hunting for that specific item, one that i might not be able to find anything like it elsewhere.
---
the issue is, as you said, it's difficult to do right, since old content is trivialized. there are ways to fix it, but it's all base, systemic changes that would drastically affect the game (like instance scaling in general, more horizontal content/progression, reduction of the effect of level-cap changes or removal of some of them entirely, change in design philosophy of items to provide more unique and naturally scaling effects, etc.), and no one knows how this would affect the game in the long run since it hasn't really been done. 
---
i would love to see a diablo mmo (better yet, a path of exile mmo) because the way loot is itemized in arpgs is more like what i enjoy. even low level items might have a unique combo of modifiers, or a legendary affix or something, that is still usable at a high level. wow gameplay + a well-done diablo-style loot system could be incredibly interesting.
---
September is considered fall where I live. No way in hell I'm scheduling my vacation when it's cold outside.
---
September is summer my dude.
---
Aimedshot when you have that pesky warrior who just charged you frosttrapped and you know he's just sitting there waiting for that big dmg. The long windup and then when it crits is the best thing about Hunters imo.
---
Most serious guilds wont roll out gear. Loot council is by far the best option in classic.
---
I had rarer shit than if back then, so yes
---
3 resist auras is enpugh to have 15 ppl with it for Huhu, which is all you need. Visc is just trivial when everyome has sapper. You will need lots pf NR if you try witgout sapper spam.
---
Everyone is going to be fighting over herbs. Travel time is long in vanilla, quests give shitty amount of silver at 60, and everyone wants gold for epic mount. You aren't farming 15 weeks of consumables in 3 hours. This isn't retail. 
---
By letting the whole raid back off on consumables when content is on farm, everyone is saving that farming time. Everyone has more gold. Not sure how you save 800 minutes on a raid cleared in a couple hours with or without consumables.
---
I'm sure when you try it out you will be hooked
---
Is there such thing as a full destruction build rotating around improved imp? So, instead of using succubus you use your imp instead to amplify all your fire damage... and is there such thing as a destruction/demonology lock pvp spec out there? That would help to keep us alive long run having some demonology talents.
---
They didn't reset until they had too, this is the problem with a level baed MMO where all the items are essentially a power level. 
---
Item complexity is why also many games simply went to a simpler approach and that is item power or a very small number of attributes. 
---
Blizzard tried many ways of fixing it, but the problem is that the more complex the system is the more problems you get. 
---
They could get away with in in Vanilla since essentially all content was fairly simple and the stat availability didn't allow for a lot of exploitation however even then at the end of vanilla you ended up with insanely top heavy stats which completely changed how classes worked and behaved.
---
Tbh its worth getting 60 riding even if the mount comes out later, the amount of time you will gain having a 60 mount will allow you to farm out more gold anyway and the time saved will be greater than the difference in saving for the 60 class quest
---
As a horde rogue who is going to be camping that defies traitor idk if sharding in westfall would be better or worse
---
My god you're right...I was using Blackhand's Breadth until I started raiding at 70.
---
If it doesn't work then it's because it's a bug and when people ask for it to get fixed, it will be. They are recreating vanilla, infinite kiting (on non wbosses) is vanilla
---
Miss you with what exactly? Do you want the gates to be open within a week? what is the whole point then?
---
Your comments about armor reduction stacling are incorrect. Tips out is not a reliable source of information.
---
"separation of roles"
---
Funny how they have taken a complete 180 on that philosophy since vanilla.
---
Being in a guild and/or having a tank who owns it is essential, but it is/was entirely possible. I had stuff waayy more rare than ironfoe back then.
---
How is this a thing...
---
Didn't know elemental shamans could do so much damage too. So Fire mage is up there in total burst but has all the utility and survivability on top of it. Id assume elemental shaman can't survive as much compared to a fire mage or a lock that specs for sustainability too.
---
You do realize it's not going to be exactly like Vanilla, right? We already have confirmed sharding to some degree (which I am okay with), and I'm sure there are other things that will be different.
---
There are these mythical creatures called friends tho, it should make it easier...
---
Its really quite a bit more than a 20 minute speedup, but I understand your feeling
---
I used to duel my Rogue friend and that's when I learned, atleast with us noobs, that Rogue's were hard countered by Warriors.
---
Come on now, you're trying to act as if Warriors wouldn't have priority on this run then just making up all these extreme examples of how you got it and trying to normalize it. 
---
You're talking some very long odds of a guild having their warriors all decked out with their own Ironfoe then willing to grind god knows how many Emperor runs in order to get it for a rogue. 
---
I have no doubt this was possible and no doubt you were able to get it but don't sit there and act like that isn't some extreme example.
---
It all really relies on how decent Ironfoe's proc is. If it's low then it really ruins the whole strategy
---
The bad thing with achievements, is it moved the get away from faction/guild goals, to personal goal.
---
I feel it shifted the game mentality from we to I.
---
You died.
---
Big oof
---
You kill a rat in the southern barrens and can pick up a one time use item that lets you summon a rat. The rat is neutral so you can attack it. This lets people do tricks like letting warriors build rage, rogues build combo points etc.
---
Warrior OH speed should be considered for two reasons: Rage generation and Flurry uptime.  You may need a faster OH if either of these are a noticeable issue.

&lt;Comprehensibility&gt; EU HORDE. Raiding &amp; PVP, Recruiting ''Casual hardcore'' Raiders / PVP's
---
Comprehensibility is a guild compromised of players, that have played a plethora of games, together for years and years with experience in top end content over a multitude of games. We aren't aiming for world firsts, what we do aim for is having experienced players, that just want to raid without uneccesary wipes while having a good time. PvP groups will be made aswell. We are primarily Scandinavian ( UTC+1 ) around the age of 26.
---
What we expect from our members:
---
Knowing your class and come prepared when accepting a date, and be punctual. Outside of that the usual you'd expect of your friends : )
---
Our raid schedule:
---
Raid schedule is still in the works, 2-3 raid days of 4H sessions, which will likely decrease as content gets on farm.
---
Raid hours have usually been 18-19:00 UTC+1
---
TL;DR : Experienced core is looking to fill our raid roster, providing a laid back leveling &amp; raiding experience with steady progress.
---
Feel free to message me if you're interested
---
So why can't I advocate for a different old wow than 1.12?
---
Working on mine. Did not saw this in quite a long time
---
The disengagement from servers is a bit sad. Now it feels like severs are only a restriction to enjoying what has largely become a single-player game.
---
The comment so nice he says it twice!
---
Yup. Summer = camping, hiking, and backpacking for me. Honestly, if it releases in July I'll probably just end up waiting until end of September to play anyway haha
---
&gt;level baed MMO where all the items are essentially a power level. 
---
I don't think they really decided that until after Vanilla's release TBH. There are plenty of games out there that add new stuff without raising the levels. Or the levels are an endless grind to work towards (like Diablo 2). At some point they shifted the designed of the game around replacing everything and resetting with a new level cap everyone's entitled to their opinion about it, but IMO it's the biggest problem with the game.
---
I know there are compromises on both sides though, you don't need to end up with 20 tiers of gear to progress through, things can be retuned and normalized after the fact, it's a better option than abandoning them entirely.
---
the paladin next to him, had ZG sheild on, so its not that early. You also see a NE rouge with aq40 shoulders, infront.
---
I wish I could read it, but since I'm an adult at work where they block everything but reddit I guess SOL
---
Yes...leveling
---
Yeah, pretty sure that's how it still is for the most part.
---
Get ready for all the Reserved Runs.
---
Blizzard should watch the first 45 seconds of the clip. That should make them think about their current game.
---
But weren't they just spamming fb?
---
Female dwarves are objectively bae.
---
Not that I know of. But that would be a bit of a meme spec because it doesn't have much survivability/utility.
---
it mostly works there because loot isn't tied to specific bosses (at least in general; there are boss-specific pieces but they aren't the norm). super low level items might still have an effect that's very usable at a high level, but acquisition of that item is rarely trivial, like how running molten core as a modern-wow level 120 is. 
---
but yeah, if there was a game with this itemization but in an mmo/wow style of gameplay, and it was done well, then i'd be playing that right now.
---
I loved ganking lowbies with this duo in vanilla.
---
It may not feel like summer where you live, but Summer doesn't end until September 23rd. We would all like for Classic to be released in the early or even middle part of Summer, but it won't be late if it is released in September, at least before the 23rd.
---
Thank you for doing these. Incredibly helpful and clean to reference while leveling.
---
This is the content I come here for
---
It's for your own good. Serious.
---
The Seal and judge system is fucking terrible.
---
There is a reason that the paladin revamp lasted less than a year before they totally caved on every spec.
---
Thanks my boy, shaman next please.
---
PD: I LOVE YOU.
---
It can't be done right that's the problem, you'll always have outliers but the longer they last the worse it is.
---
RNG loot piñata games have a very different mechanics where you essentially choose one or 2 stats to max out and look for some lucky proc, the difficulty of the content in these games is also pretty similar as far as scaling goes.
---
And ironically Blizzard tried to implement a similar mechanic with reforging and artifact power and it wasn't a good success.
---
Lol, it is not at all extreme. Maybe now with all the minmaxers it would be tougher but back then nobody really gave a fuck. I had thunderfury bindings on my hunter because when they dropped, nobody knew what the fuck it was and assumed that whatever it is a hunter can use it.
---
Back to classic: if you have friends it is super easy to get shit like this, and brd emp runs are retardedly easy as well. So piss off and dont ruin the fun. If an item is not class restricted and your guild is fine with it, you can go for it if you want to.
---
yeah but as arcane, you dont actually cast arcane spells. you use it with the other 2 speccs.
---
Vacation he says, you mean dismissal
---
Haha, I feel you.   I want to roll an enhancement shaman and everyone is making it sound horrible.  I'm not giving up the dream tho.
---
Yes you're the only one
---
As a warrior, not so much my own abilities but rather noticing multiple procs in a row and the explosion of numbers on the screen, like Sword spec proc off of MS + HoJ or WF from a simultaneous auto.
---
You never know when the stars are going to align and it's always an incredibly satisfying moment.
---
There are some cases where you cannot create genuine real life traffic, or scenarios that the testers did not create. Hence beta tests. (Plus beta tests is free feedback and so on).
---
Idk where you been but on blizzlike pservers literally all respectable good players got 60 in under 6 days played, and the number one on ND was Journey, who utilized dynamic respawns to get 60 in less than 3 days played
---
Me two weeks after release: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjapSF94eCc
---
Yeah that makes sense.  I just get the feels the op was referring to the mage that wants to spam arcane missiles and... Blink and arcane nova.
---
Improved water?   If you go 51/0/0 do cucumber slices appear in the water?   Mmmm
---
Sorry, got distracted.
---
I don't think transmog has a place in classic, but you have never been able to transmog those items (and a ton of other comedic items).
---
NF/conflag is the best "destruction" build for locks, big burst with instant sbolts/conflag/sburn
---
Hand of rang is a cool looking shit weapon, on'y ret and enh have really use for it

---
* Server: NA-PVP-Alliance (Mostly located in PST timezone)
---
* Introduction: We're a core group of around 12 players who all played and raided in vanilla WoW looking to expand our ranks to create a competent, quality over quantity raid team to progress through everything classic WoW has to offer. That being said, our ultimate focus and reason for clearing PvE content is to dominate in PvP.
---
* Loot System: Loot council
---
* Raid Times: Undecided. Likely to be week nights around 7:00pm PST. We will try to find a time that works best for the majority of our players as we get closer to Classic release.
---
* Expectations + Philosophy: We don't expect everyone to go 110% no-life to min-max every aspect of their performance, but we do expect competence, efficiency, and a willingness to excel from all of our members. Our experienced players are willing to help guild mates run dungeons, get attuned, and understand their class, gearing choices, rotations, and the raid encounters. We'll gladly take a proactive player who is learning a new class over a veteran who isn't willing to put forth the effort.
---
If you are interested, give me a message on discord: **Etc#7848**
---
Nah, it's honestly not even close. There's way more going on on retail in that regard. Look at all the buffs and debuffs going on in this video.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqiU9NfdH-8
---
And the consider the spell batching stuff, modern WoW is running those checks many times more per second than vanilla wow and Classic do. And then consider that each additional person is closer to multiplying the server stress rather than linearly adding to it since each person's effects have to be checked against every other person's effects.

Nobody is saying not to go for it. People are saying be realistic. 
---
&gt;I had thunderfury bindings on my hunter because when they dropped, nobody knew what the fuck it was and assumed that whatever it is a hunter can use it.
---
No you didn't. 
---
The amount of time I've seen people making this claim yet never able to back it up on these forums is ludicrous. 
---
Molten Core was released on November 13th, the world first Thunder Fury was completed two weeks later. 
---
&gt; if you have friends it is super easy to get shit like this
---
Not quite what the user who posted the story had to go through
---
How else do you earn gold on RP realms?  
---
Man's trying to plot out his prostitution ring with what the people want.
---
On a completely unrelated note because I have no issue with loot trading for raid content and sharding for starter zones, but I have a real tough timing taking anything serious that doesn’t have the beginning of the sentence capitalized.
---
This opens up so many possibilities.....

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Fury Warriors.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.  
---
**Current Activity**:  Currently a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers a few are raiding hardcore.  The guild is preparing to begin practicing on our own test server to begin getting the group oriented to the old content.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**

---
Im not too knowledgable on the subject but you have a good point here imo.
---
Pretty much all of them. You always have some of the bigger named characters that existed before said expansion that gets fleshed out a bit. Not so much in TBC, but in FT+ there has been so much Troll lore added with every expansion for sure. Almost everything about the Pandaren from MoP. Deathwing and his specific lore. Etc. Even in TBC you had the back story for Thrall's family and stuff, and I think some additions to the lore for Azshara and Illidan.
---
No, he's saying that there are hundreds of thousands of people playing vanilla actively, spread across all the servers. Which I think is an overstatement, but there's definitely tens of thousands, and if you add if all up I bet you get over a hundred thousand people who log regularly.
---
Dammit, can only go 47/0/0.
---
Highlord Kruul though, so its TBC prepatch.
---
That would be sick if you can actually do that.
---
I didn't say you couldn't.
---
We shall see, I'm happy to be proven wrong but I'd be very surprised if world first is below 5 days played. With the average being around 9-10.
---
Does it have good utility/survivability?
---
Recently played a private server and I think the difference is that you don't feel like a god in Vanilla. In retail you can pull 5+ mobs at times and do almost any content on your own. 
---
In Vanilla if I see a warrior about to die, I throw him a heal and buff him with MOTW and thorns because I know how painful that corpse run is. 
---
Helping each other naturally leads into cooperation/friendships.
---
If you have ever played a game where communication is important, you know the answer to this. Not trying to be rude, but it seems like you've only played singleplayer games and/or retail?
---
I’m one of the two guys (as of time of writing) who voted Tauren. 
---
Yeah. I went there
---
"Hey, i'm the guild leader going Holy Paladin and am looking for a dedicated warlock friend to grind hard the first week or two together duo leveling. PM me or check out the Discord if you're interested!
---
Also, here's the guild."
---
**&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)** **(Maybe RP-PVP, Guild Vote)**
---
What is Lakeshire Guard?
---
Lakeshire Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck. We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakeshire and all of our members.
---
Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you at the Inn.

Please read the Bulletin-Board and apply in the applications within the Discord.

Do you guys not have phones?

I’m rolling a paladin so I can’t wait to use this lol. For the alliance!
---
what
---
Blizzard clearly stated summer 2019
---
Good bot
---
There is absolutely no way they can guarantee that the game will be ready and released during the summer, but can't decide on a date for it for technical reasons. In all likelihood they're struggling with the retail azshara raid patch and as a company refuse to release Classic before the hype has died down from the new raid. After they figure out when the patch will be deployed, expect Classic to be released around a month from that.
---
Playing these childish games is particularly frustrating when the demographic of classic is largely made up of adults that have to register vacationdays in advance and release dates for new games are announced a year before.
---
Dude Wants [to play] A Roleplaying Female
---
This post is really dumb.
---
Ahh very interesting I had no idea, and a strange choice to do it that way for sure. They are big time missing out.
---
Nice wall of text.
---
\#nochanges
---
The temporary sharding in start zones isn't to offset any potential costs, it's to keep tourist inflation from destroying Classic communities before they even start. And I don't believe, in any capacity, that they would ever charge more for Classic servers.
---
Fixed
---
I love these old videos!
---
Every world ever. Thrash Blade is pure hot garbage.
---
Back in vanilla I won one during a 10 man Strath run. Was my first epic and I sold it to get my epic mount.
---
I like it!
---
Also, how about that ice wall on the edge of the world keeping all the water in?  
---
Yeah, no.
---
Yes there are plenty of games that do that but they have a different set of core mechanics and a different value and reward system.
---
And yes ofc they haven't decided it until much later, they kept the Vanilla itemisation through cata I haven't played MoP but essentially when reforging and the item power systems were introduced they were introduced just for that to change how the itemization works in the game in line with more "modern" approaches.
---
The problem many people overlook is that you can't have a game with a lot of complex systems, the more complex systems you have the more sluggish the overall experience tends to be and it both requires you to do more changes and makes making changes harder as they are more unpredictable which is a huge catch 22.
---
For example when you have a complex and overloaded stats system designing complex fights is harder because you need to allow for fights to be completed in multiple ways so you end up either with fairly simple fights or with fights that require you to have a very specific stat combination which filters out the complexity in your stats system. It also opens the system to unpredicted exploits such as a specific stats combination allowing you to bypass mechanics which is essentially an unintentional version of the latter.
---
itemization in games is a very hard thing to do when you need to balance it against other game systems, reward mechanics, usability and player value.
---
At the end of the day most players want a reward for killing a big baddy, if the only reward you have in your game is gear then you have to essentially be constantly upgrading it otherwise the playerbase gets upset and this was true for Vanilla aswell.
---
Heck I remeber the bitch and moaning when they introduced the Tier 0.5 items from the raiders, I've also remembered the bitching and moaning that happened when they told people that it won't be just an instant upgrade if you already had the set.
---
I despite of what retail is today I think it's a bloody miracle that Blizzard managed to maintain WoW for as long as they have I don't care if they only have 5M players now instead of 10 or w/e because for games like this there isn't a single change you can do that would not split the community and usually both sides would be pissed at you just for different reasons.
---
Sap (with talents)
---
Sap people while they’re questing, don’t open on them. Watch them go slowly mad as you follow them for 30 minutes sapping them just when they think you’re gone. 
---
Sap people as they’re about to get on a boat then laugh as it leaves without them.
---
Sap passing mounted players to give the, that sense of dread before you open with a cheap shot.
---
Sap flag carriers as they cross the battlefield, giving time for your team to arrive. 
---
Sap mobs at strategic moments in their patrol to get through areas (especially cities) unhindered. Makes WoW feel like a stealth game.
---
Sap mobs in dungeons. 
---
It’s just a great sandbox ability.
---
Could you be a little more specific please?
---
You can have a different opinion, no problem but I would like to hear it if possible.
---
Ironfoe is incredible till you get Thunderfury. The best items are the hardest to get.
---
They know that the success of classic hinges on it being a far, far different beast to retail. The classic fans (the entire reason they're doing this in the first place) are so adamant about what does and doesn't go into the game that they know that adding any sort of microtransaction would be asking for trouble.
---
Only topped by the recent "Classic Etiquette" post. That one was seriously brain damaged.
---
&gt; Are you sure you aren't still 12? Seriously? In what world does you booking some vacation sway the indefinable release date of a development we have no idea of the progression of? 
---
Many of the more reasonable heads around this game sugested two years for development, and you're all talking like the game is coming out this year. Quit it, grow up some.
---
Yes everyone knows what you've stated. It becomes mentally offensive how much of an echo chamber this subreddit is. Pservers =/= vanilla. And pserver players are baddies who troll. But also remember that it is these same baddie trolls that got us classic in the first place. And blizzard is even imulating the content releases to the tune of pservers. It is because of us that classic has become a reality.
---
This is the sole reason I’m playing a priest. Also mana burn for the lols
---
I wasn't considering debuffs so yeah I guess so. But really and truly all this discussion was worth it to be linked that video. That is amazingly broken,  I don't follow bfa so what was allowing that?
---
P2002 eq 3-box server.
---
OP has a fair point in that prosaically, Blizzard is not the classic player's "friend." Blizzard had to be dragged kicking and screaming into making classic servers and probably only consented because of how poorly retail is doing compared to its high water mark during Wrath when there were ~11 million subscribers. 
---
But it's goofy to think that we can meaningfully predict and counteract any business move we don't like by interacting with the company like this. They're either gonna fuck it up in the end or they're not. We got this far, there's no point in handwringing about it. It'll be chill.
---
&gt; One of the things about Vanilla WoW was it was new FOR EVERYONE
---
Just to hop on this real quick, you have to remember it's been what, 14-15 years for us all? No it wont be truly *new*, but it will be a re-learning experience we all get to share together. You'll have forgotten things about vanilla just like I've forgotten things about vanilla and we'll all be having those moments together. It's a kind of new-ness.
---
Man YTMND... memories...
---
You can still do it. But I think you need to temper your expectations. Maybe have a ret paladin alt.
---
has decent utility but that's just because its a lock other lock specs have more. Curse of tongues, HS, spellstone 3 viable pvp pets depending on how things are going, fear and dc
---
Survivability mostly boils down to kill them before they kill you or cc them, VW shield + hs gives you some more health. Overall though you aren't going to be juking 3 people and getting away like a mage though positioning is very important with all lock specs
---
Yes but if it releases in september it's no longer summer here and I won't spend my vacation in the cold because of a video game. August is the latest I'm willing to take my vacation, if Classic is out at that time that's great, otherwise I'll just have to play it in the fall.
---
Xbox. Darkest dungeon(highly recommend) and Star Trek online(do not recommend).
---
Should we have battlegroups? What do you consider a change? Everything isn’t black and white.
---
Ark survival evolved
---
They dont give release dates unless they're 100% firm. This is blizzard, the founders of "soon"
---
For like preraid BIS it’s a bit tougher but you can make your own groups &amp; pay tanks. 
---
Stuff like truestrike shoulders, dal rends will be tough to get but not impossible
---
Got Dusk on steam. Really nice fast paced shooter. Just got into Moonface so I'm playing their discography a fair bit lately. Downloaded ESO over the weekend going to give that a try.
---
Single player games. Just finished a new PC, been jumping back and forth between games. Metro Exodus currently is the main one.
---
It was very obvious from quite early on that Classic is intended to be a small side project with only a few developers and minimal running costs.
---
However I'm pretty sure that server costs are basically rounding error for Blizzard. The vast majority of the costs are salaries. Also Activison-Blizzard laid off a lot of people to make *even more obscene amounts of profit*, not to make ends meet. Last year was the *most profitable year* for them, ever.
---
They absolutely not need "microtransactions" to make Classic profitable, whether they do sharding or not. So don't be afraid to ask for a good Classic experience. If it doesn't involve ongoing human support (developer or other time) it'll not matter for them financially at all.
---
Well, sharding offsets cost in a passive way.
---
the destroyed communitys and lowpop servers have to be merged and that means blizzard will have too many servers after the merge. In other words too much upfront spending to compensate for the tourists.
---
( I hope that makes it clearer)
---
Seriously. Peoples reactions to loot trading was so dramatic its shameful.
---
And a big chunk of those players aren't playing on Blizzlike vanilla, where you can buy characters gold etc. 
---
The biggest server now has around 6-7k players at a time. 100k active players is possible but really generous.
---
 &lt;**Mediocre**\&gt; **\[A\] \[NA\] \[PvP\]**
---
&lt;Mediocre&gt; is led by an extremely experienced player, both in retail and the private server scene. Dependable, transparent leadership coupled with policies that promote healthy competition and community is what sets us apart.
---
The core of the guild has been playing together on the private server scene for a while. While we are still months away from retail classic launch, we wanted to begin the process of building a player-base for the big show.
---
As information comes in regarding the more nuanced questions surrounding the game (e.g. reverting from 16 to 8 debuffs at launch, dungeon loot itemization/tables etc), we'll be updating our internal resources and plans accordingly. We'll be fully prepared for launch, join now!

You said:
---
"there's no way the game won't be out by then."
---
That is the point I was addressing.
---
&gt; Sap people as they’re about to get on a boat then laugh as it leaves without them.
---
devilish
---
Thats a bullshit statement you sprouted out of nowhere and you know it.
---
Yep if you didn't had access to AQ40/NAXX gear and had the BWL trinket for some specific classes you likely wouldn't upgrade it if you weren't min maxing.
---
I'm pretty sure there were better trinkets but since Kara was essentially UBRS you didn't had to really farm as much gear as you had for say MC/Ony to "raid".
---
Why is it strange? People want the original game back, not the original data in a new skin.
---
Good.
---
Yep. People completely misinterpreting "server stability"
---
It's not the stability of the physical servers... it's about the stability of the Doomhammer Server Community.
---
I am a rebel. I upvoted.
---
He literally said one for the guild.
---
I'm not very familiar with BFA either but if I had to guess, I'd say some combination of Earth Shield, Nature's Guardian which heals for 20% of the Shaman's health when they drop below 35%, the heal over time from Riptide, maybe Healing Rain and Healing Stream Totem? Not sure.
---
Why is shadow priest in there? Amazing spec
---
Even tough we have another opinion about Blizzard thank you for your comment.
---
It is great to hear that there are still people that believe Blizzard tries to please customers before their shareholders.
---
very cute
---
I imagine playing a Necromancer in WoW. That‘d be fuckin crazzzy dude I mean imagine going to raids with an army of ghouls and skeletons while spamming bone spears.
---
&gt;An annoying thing that some mages did
---
But wouldn't that be two GCD's - also, you would have to be very accurate with your blink + clicking skill. If someone can pull that off successfully, then more power to them, I guess. I can't believe this was very widespread, or if it did occur then some Mage had great technique...
---
Dps warriors seem to be in a good spot.
---
Wouldn't a raid rather take extra rogues though?
---
Pallies too! I can't wait for the early sale on tradeskill items.
---
I just had the strongest memory, I was in the same boat and just recalled doing the same thing.  Like for a second I was back at my Grandparents house playing in her craft room where the computer was.  I don’t ever recall having a memory so strong before.
---
Phasing, I don't want it. The idea is a cancer and it's proponents should be placed on a boat, to retail. With the phasing they love so damn much. The thing about having a real world. Is some times it gets crowded. It will add to the hype not detract from the game.
---
Something about getting shadow weaving stacks maxed on a enemy player and then its time for that sweet max dmg Mind Flay always felt good.
---
Or We don't do sharding at all. Which is a much better idea.
---
absolutely. Especially when they run straight away from you, it fades off, and then they run back to you. Once they are about to hit you, you get anotherfear cast off in time.
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you want to only play ret, you can do that as long as you're prepared to be excluded from some groups/guilds because of it.
---
If you don’t mind healing while you're on progress, and be allowed to go ret and do bad dps when you have a raid on farm, that's something a lot more guilds will be fine with.
---
Only reason some servers would be imbalanced is if players can plan in advance and flock to one faction on a server. If they don't announce anything beforehand the population should be very evenly spread. That a server would be dead on launch is impossible, just not going to happen. And if a server will be "dead" in a few months or not is nothing you can see by having a list before launch.
---
I've been giving retail a chance but it just feels weird. Like everyone says there's really never any reason to interact with other players. It feels like encountering a glitched NPC to run into another player in the gameworld.
---

This is me.  I played ret in vanilla and want to do enh shaman this time.  I am a glutton for punishment.
---
Same here man, kind of sucks the fun out of the hype
---
Lol I am in the opposite camp. I want the age of MC to be an eternity. Then I want the BWL phase to be an eternity. I also want naxx thrown off a cliff. It ruins every private server lol.

*triggered*
---
Based on the other comments it seems this sub wants to 30x 2006 screenshots and 50x my wow story posts instead of some discussion about the game.
---
my post was not a suggestion about what we should do but rather what might happen and the reasoning behind their decisions.
---
I do agree with you, but I would just say that players are not a unified voice, they're all different and different groups are going to 'bitch' about every possible change.
---
Most of these problems and solutions to them are a spectrum though, and there are better compromises that are not even considered. Just as a simple example shouting in chat for a group and then disbanding when someone quits is an extreme, the complete opposite extreme is a matchmaker tool that creates the composition, invites people automatically and teleports you to the content is an absolute extreme on the other end of that spectrum. There are perfectly good compromises in between those 2 scenarios that developers should be more willing to consider, especially when solutions to problem alter the experience of the game in such a significant way.
---
I think we can all agree people want to kill the boss and get loot, but the loot means nothing to me when it's just a meaningless stat stick no different than the one I had at level 70, 80 or 100. It's no better or more valuable and it just feels pointless to get new gear in each new expansion. Even worse is the gear I already have means nothing, in plenty of older games lower level gear has value that at least goes towards the new gear you upgrade into, making it feel like that old gear was still worthwhile to have.
---
I like much of this post.   I'm no Changes as a philosophy, but the comps you suggest do not change the design philosophy but fix 2019 issues
---
Orc always

Pretty much only tanks need fire resist gear.
---
I actually just started playing hearthstone. Never thought I’d pick up this game but it’s been fun to play on my phone when I’m going to bed at night
---
Do you need herb for DM farming? I thought the mobs just dropped the herbs. I’m not sure though, just checking.
---
8/16?
---
Thanks blizzard. That's for the mention in your game. I feel like red shirt guy now.
---
Why is making the game unplayable a better idea?
---
Why though, do we have a true poll on graphics? my guess would be that 99% of people would want new upgraded graphics. Would you go and replay half life 2 in its 15 year old graphics, or play it totally upgraded. At least give an option to toggle it on or off if people want that true nostalgia.

Mirah's is considered pre-bis because it is a fast off hand and in no possible way could it ever out perform Thrash Blade in the Main Hand slot. Not mathematically possible with the way Rogue abilities scale. 
---
Combat Sword is always going to prioritize Slow Main Hand, Fast Offhand for poisons procs.
---
If you can find me one single spreadsheet, dps calculator or pre-bis list that priortizes Fast MH Over slow OH, or shows how it is possible for Thrash Blade as MH to be outclassed by Mirah's please show me.
---
There's a ton of weird "auras" running around constantly for every character/spec. For instance, there are hidden auras modifying like nearly every single paladin heal/damage attack regardless of spec at differing %s. It's done mostly to fine-tweak numbers for balancing.
---
Vanilla doesn't exactly have that. It's very much more "in your face" when it comes to damage and healing of spells, so there's no need for hidden auras modifying your spec's existence.
---
Your the best man thx!

classic on a pserver

The goal of the project is to bring back the *game*, not the *experience* (which is a nebulous, entirely subjective concept). If you understand and accept that, you'll understand why there should be no changes.

"This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important." - J. A. Brack (https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
I only managed to use it a handful of times but when I played Druid I loved Tranquility. 
---
I played healer but occasionally there would be a PUG instance where there was another healer so I went feral. Saved a few wipes in very specific circumstances.  Near end of fight, tank lost control, healer down, all the health bars heading downwards all at once - change shape, cast Tranquility and bathe in the glorious light from the heavens as the health bars head back up and every mob in a 3 mile radius comes tearing in my direction. Bought time for finishing fight and/or rez main healer.
---
I started raiding MC when there were only about 4-5 guilds doing it on my server, before BWL was out.  I was decked out in full Devout Gear, same as almost all the other priests.  It wasn't until we had a silly little warlock rocking mostly greens  who was out DPSing almost everyone made one comment that changed everything.  When we asked why he still had all those greens he just said, "I like the extra shadow damage."  Soon after that there was a split in the guild, some casters (like myself) and melee bought into the idea that you didn't need to match or have a set bonus to out-damage, out-tank, or out-heal someone with similar abilities.  That same warlock took over as raid leader, we started getting worldbuffs like Nef and were clearing MC rather quickly.  It's not completely necessary to have full preraid BiS for MC, but it does help in later raids like BWL, AQ, and Naxx to know what you need for specific fights.  Eventually you stop worrying about 1 set and focus on having good nature resist gear, or gear that gives you a lot of health but still manage to do good damage/healing.  Eventually you're gonna need multiple sets of multiple types of gear and having something SLIGHTLY less powerful is probably fine.
---
The new models aren't bad in terms of quality (precision, number of polygones), but their running/casting animations are straight from Disney movies. Have you seen Taurens running animation ? Tbh Donald Duck runs more realistically.
---
Unplayable? I seem to remember getting my character to 60 then to 70, then to 80. All without this crappy tech. So unplayable? No it's not unplayable. It's really crowded but, not unplayable. I have no interest in the "just the tip" logic of blizzard. I have no interest in compromising the fidelity of a fully immersive continuous world. For a little convenience at the start.
---
Warrior has sword specialization too though?
---
Same man, feral Druid on vanilla.   My first alt will be a ranged warrior.
---
I think a huge part of what vanilla shine was the community. I think cross realms kills that for PvP. 
---
I get wanting lower queue times, but BGs were so much more meaningful when you knew the people you were fighting every single game instead a sea of faceless red. 
---
I would be ok with battle groups if they did very small battle groups. Small enough that you’d still recognize the same names and people often. 
---
The real issue is usually much more of one faction is queuing than the other but unfortunately there’s no real fix for that.
---
actually, it is black and white, it should be if possible exactly like classic originally was.
---
Teebling is the hero none of us deserve
---
I want to come back on the rank 14 stuff. Nowadays , people do it for the weapon, they are bis till late naxx for warriors for example. And they obviously raid too, because you basically do it once, get your weapon then stop (usually prior to aq.)
---
Now, if you're saying it's impossible even in naxx bis, yeah the pvp stuff doesn't matter much.
---
i agree i dont think realistically i can be in the first group of 60's because i refuse to practice.
---
for the people who can go pretty hard in the paint and be i  the first pack of 60's yeah its worth the risk
---
but in this case it shoupd be very clear to people if they think they will be some of the first 60s
---
i actually plan to dual box so ill be a fair bit slower than most , still need to know more about the client though before i fully decide
---
Very interesting
---
Quite a few people have access to 2 or more accounts. Think your account and perhaps your child.
---
Nope.
---
This is a pretty good strategy, but man oh man. I pray they don't screw you over by announcing it at the technical END of the summer which would be September... Summer ends September 23rd.
---
Also dungeon and raid quests.   But I'm not sure that's what you mean.
---
If it was a new game I would 100% see the need for a beta, which provides a stress test as well.  This game is not new therefore we do not get one
---
They can simulate the load (player and mob density per zone) and with servers dynamically scaling, ensure they arent overextending with their processors.  Honestly 15 years of hardware advancements make the whole game smaller.  One server will likely contain many realms, all under the same load.  
---
Latency is the only thing Blizzard is not in control of
---
Man, I don't even know where to start with this one. Get out now before this sub rips you to shreds. You're so far off the mark, man.
---
The #nochanges extremism that some of the fanbase have. I'm not worried about any change that could have easily been a "bug fix" back in original vanilla. Like if they make pathing better, or improve the tick rate/whatever it's called in PvP. Or even if they change how debuffs are handled. 
---
I understand that it can have massive changes to the "meta" from vanilla/pservers. But it really is still the same game, just a new patch with a bunch of fixes/improvements. Obviously if they start changing classes, spells, items, NPCs, etc. Then it's straying a lot further from what vanilla was, I don't want that. But the community essentially forcing the developers to hack in old "bugs" and stuff into the game instead of just rolling with the new improved engine feels like a huge waste of time.
---
Is finding a spot as Druid really that hard if you’re healing?
---
If they do it's not the end of the world. I'm not taking my vacation in September, it's fucking cold outside here in the fall.
---
Hunters are only low DPS in AQ/Naxx and even then raids bring them for tranq. 
---
They're great in dungeons and PVP.
---
Not useless in raids. Useful, their dps just drops off as gear levels get higher. Great dps in 5 mans and early raids, god-tier in PvP with the right hands. 
---
As for race, whichever you like the look of the best. Shadowmeld can be good for ambushing people though, especially in BGs.
---
Not so much urban legend as fatal noobie prank, but telling people you could see Rag if you ran into the molten rune in the wall behind Golemagg was fun™.
---
If you really commit to it it's definitely doable.
---
I went pure enhancement on Nost - ran black dragonscale along with HoJ, eventually a Nightfall and the rest of the prebis list. 
---
It took forever, was VERY expensive and in the end not super rewarding. In hindsight I probably could've gone resto, joined a guild and eventually gotten OS rolls on enhancement gear instead.
---
People will usually accept you in pugs for Onyxia/MC/ZG if you've done pre-quests and have Nightfall though, so if you want to you can totally go for it. People were generally accepting if they saw the effort I had put into it.
---
Vanilla had points in history with xrelm and without. So the topic of xrealm BGs is not black and white.
---
Speed runs are about speeding to level 60, with no regard for what condition you will be in once you hit 60 (money, skills, reputation, professions, dungeon keys, etc).
---
If you plan on actually playing your character after you hit 60 then you should not try to do a speed run. You will end up spending more time post-60 going back and doing all the stuff you skipped, rather than if you had just done it while leveling.
---
There was a rumor on my server that some of the Main Tanks on our realm where actually GMs because they NEVER types in chat. Only in whispers.
---
Eh, they don't really have the traditional server blades you're thinking of. And they don't do server merges, they do "Connected Realms" which keep their servers independent but they are permanently "cross-realmed" with one another.
---
As a ret paladin main, I plan on having lotsa fun ;D
---
Thank you for your informative response.
---
Need some form of dedicated graphics.
---
They have backpedaled on arguably three initial design choices as well: four phases, loot trading, and spell batching.
---
I'm not saying it is likely they will, but the ability for them to change their mind is always on the table.
---
Hunters were great for 5 mans.   Dps, cc, potentially an off tank, good threat management, aspects, etc.    The only negative in hunters was the whole, everything is a hunter weapon, but that's the player, not the class.    But worst than that, the hunter that thought it was his job to pull without telling anyone.
---
Trinkets don't activate the GCD, which is why mages can do the trinket + instant pyroblast in an instant. I think they are called 3 minute mages because of the cooldown on Arcane Presence or whatever the talent is called.
---
Roll a full set of 8 classes. All you need are night elves and humans.
---
Funny part is
---
**its not even TELLING people how to play, its MOCKING them**
---
People are getting butthurt out of their own insecurity/pride.
---
Yeah fuck those mages.
---
Man that's a lot of changes. I think we should just leave the game as it was. Different people dislike different parts of vanilla, the only way to make sure nobody has the right to be upset is to not change anything.
---
I recently added a SSD to my computer recently and man what a game-changer.
---
It really does feel amazing.
---
Yeah, if you have help the dynamic changes and it depends on what kind of help you have as to what benefits you / your group the most. I think the fact that it's a hard choice is a indicator of how good the race traits are.
---
As always, I'll ask: do you NEED a laptop? Are you actually going to travel with it and play WoW on the go enough to warrant buying one instead of a desktop where you'll get a way better system for your money?
---
You sure told him, now go back to your cave.
---
The point he is making - is battlegroups were in Vanilla. So which version do you want? 
---
Personally - I’m #nochanges , and with regards to battlegroups, I remember that being the time when I fell out of love with PVP. 
---
This whole situation is like what my country is facing now. Half the population screaming for Brexit but now don’t know what version of Brexit we want.
---
Haha.
---
Shadow is fine, enhancement is not.
---
I'll admit, I play a druid healer, only really do dungeons since im not even 60 yet... But I almost never use Tranquility, I just forget to. I've only recently gotten better about using natures swiftness to save someone from high damage.
---
I was told that your pet could learn different abilities by eating different foods. Fuckers.
---
Then AQ20 drops and suddenly everyone is clamoring for more mana burn capability in the raid.
---
With a sweet Nightfall proc, you're in business.
---
It's viable for classic wow, sub Reddit.  😁
---
How dare you.
---
Too bad we have a 3 month silence cast on us.
---
... You can jump. Arguably higher than WoW sans Demon Hunters.
---
Just make a Lalafell and realize you can jump over your total height haha.
---
&gt;'m complaining about demo not being Classic. Shamans could use 2h without 2h talent, the energy was regening much faster than it should've been, hunters going in combat when pet started running towards the target and more and more. This is all class related that private servers did right and mighty Blizzard couldn't handle for demo.
---
The point of the demo was to fix shit like this? Which is exactly why they told us to post feedback and thanked us for doing so.
---
They obviously didn't use a mANGOS core or something else, like the private servers are doing, which have all this fixed by default.
---
8gb ram isn't enough and no graphic card? Yea... you need something better.
---
That's a good thought. Instead of using a profession until 60 and then making the change only use it for the extra money to get your mount at 40 and then switch. It changes the dynamic. It means you take a break from leveling to go back and get your new profession up to speed, but that isn't a big deal in your case if you bank the mining mats to level engineering.
---
Realm caps. If they get bullied into changing them by the private server crybabies the game will be dead on arrival.
---
I'm a Car Hauler so the majority of this year will be spent on the road, so I'm trying to find a decent laptop capable of battlegrounds without lag issues. Preferably one that's relatively cheap. I know that limits the spectrum of viable laptops but I'm sure they exist, im just not entirely educated on what I'll need precisely and how to narrow down my search results via this.
---
Fair enough!
---
Yeah, I always feel like such a scrub when I get baited into a frost trap. Then the fear sets in.
---
Then (Nov 2004):  Fresh out of college, new job, and newly married playing WoW like a second job (60-80 hours a week) with my husband
---
Now:  Still at same job, mom of 3 - got myself a healbot out of the deal.
---
Oh! I didnt know that.
---
Do you know what kind of server they are specificly using?
---
Or do you have some scource where i can read up on that? I am interested :)
---
Many "stress test/betas" these days are just demos of the game. They are used more for selling the game than actually testing things. Yes they get information out of them, but it is not their primary function, which is to advertise the game.
---
It'll run it, not great though, biggest issue will be busy bits like Alterac Valley, should be ok for leveling and stuff though.
---
Haha, why am I picturing a dwarf with a bear.  "Eat the damn boar!   Ye'll learn ta charge!"
---
You downranked heals in tbc as well. The major difference (on the class) is lack of Och and prayer of mending.
---
Was mostly Activision's influence
---
It's easier than finding a spot as a hunter, but not by much:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis_of_private_server_40man_raid_composition/
---
Druids at least have the benefit of being an underplayed class, so you won't be competing against as many players.
---
Plus everyone who follows a speed run guide will be trying to buy some.
---
I mean, there is a very specific use for it, which makes it all the more satisfying when you get a Killing Blow with it in PVP. Also, fights like Ossirian or Chromaggus, where you get to pop out your arcane damage once in a while is nice!
---
Hunters get a bad rap in 5mans, but are actually amazing. The hunter problem is that most hunters spend all of their time solo, since hunters are such a strong solo class and because hunters probably benefit the least from dungeon itemization before your mid-40s. This results in most hunters not having a damn clue how to play their class in a group. Frost trap + pet OT + kiting makes you one of the most versatile CC classes in the game, you're not dependent on mana for your dps so you can go forever, and you have a decent utility package of group buffs. 
---
Hunters in pvp are also pretty strong, but certainly have some matchups. It's all about learning to manage the distance between you and the other players, taking advantage of your long range to engage, then keeping people out of your dead zone as they focus on you.
---
True hunters are pretty mediocre in raids, particularly as new content rolls out due to poor scaling mechanics. Upshot of hunters is that you need very little support since you can control your own threat and outrange many boss mechanics. Another benefit of being a hunter in raid is that your tier sets are great, so you can gear up quickly without competing for loot with other classes.
---
Between Nelf and Dwarf, Dwarf is objectively strongly thanks to the Stoneform racial. However, Shadowmeld is a skill that just has so much utility, particularly on a pvp server, that you won't be sad being a nelf either. Personally I've always wanted a Nelf hunter with a cat pet (who can also stealth) and a Survival build that really leverages Wyvren Sting. I know it's gimmicky, but it just sounds like so much fun.
---
*Ccckkqquerp* /walks away from Keyboard
---
Whoa it's the fabled "New Player"
---
No one else has said anything about graphics so far, and you are the only person over the last few months of reading this sub that specifically wants the old graphics for some reason. Nothing wrong with that, and I appreciate the initial info.
---
Saaame
---
you're getting jumped on, but I do agree with you. I think we have gotten some good feedback and responses on classic plans that has me hoping those more nuanced issues are fixed that you mentioned. I don't blame you for being skeptical.
---
Freezing trap on the plank leading to the boat at Booty Bay. Few things more satisfying than seeing an opposite faction player running to the boat to Ratchet at the last moment and seeing 'em freeze solid and remain frozen as the boat pulls away.
---
Osrs
---
I remember that quite a few people thought that there was a way to buy [the Bengal Tiger mount](https://ironyca.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/unavailable-cat-mounts.jpg) by wall-jumping over ZG and finding a secret cave. Supposedly there was a vendor that rarely spawned in that cave that would sell this special mount.
---
I know right? Would you believe I have even gotten DEATH THREATS over playing a ret paladin in vanilla? It's insane how angry people get over it
---
Like why does it bother them so much? I'd be sitting in IF and just get whispers about how much of a horrible person I am and to "KYS" all because I'm playing a ret paladin???
---
Cs go and league og legends
---
I say it’s fun but I suck so bad bruh
---
Classic on pserver. My head had been turned too much
---
Like why tf do I always run out of cards before my opponent
---
If there were no changes the kid would be alive.  Fuck hashtags and this “movement”.  The classic team often honored its team and customers, as they should now.
---
Lemme guess, you also never spoke up about feeling that something isnt going down correctly.
---
And if you did, you did when you were leaving already anyways.
---
??? 8 Gigs of ram is enough. I Mythic Raid on a 2010 rig with 8 gigs of Ram and an HD Radeon 6800 series.
---
Didnt they lay off people because they wont have any major releases in the next 2-3 years?
---
They might have said its just a side project but making classic as profitable as possible seems to be a good idea during the time that they wont release anything big soon.
---
This is the kind of asshole behavior I look forward to. That's not quite as bad as giving fortitude to people when they jump off the zeppelin, though, cause then you're dicking with your own side.
---
God your tears when ypu realise melee dps is even better in Classic because of 1.12 items, talents and the mobs having less armor than private servers.
---
So good
---
People being mad without knowing what's up.  
---
Classic ehm... Well, Classic.
---
Whatever this is, don't buy it. Specs are garbage for what you're probably paying. Head over to r/suggestalaptop and check out some recommendations.
---
Priest leveling is mainly about how good the wand is, rest is a bonus.

---
Just because 10 warriors is an ideal comp, doesnt mean everyone will demand this. Any class can get into raids. Maybe not any spec though
---
Exactly. There are situations were both sides of the fence have valid opinions. 
---
Very small battlegroups could cater to both sides rather than alienating one side. I think this is the case for many topics. 
---
Blizzard wont make everything 1:1 ie 16 debuff slots. So “no changes” people should probably be on board with a small buff to MC even though it is a change.
---
At original launch, all servers were at capacity, running extremely slowly, crashing, or rebooting.  You couldn't kill mobs because they were already dead.  Without sharding the first week or so, a lot of new players will probably be extremely turned off to the game because of the issues at launch.
---
I wouldn't mind spending the first couple days competing with an entire server for the same mobs, but I can see how a lot of players wouldn't want that.
---
I think he meant 4GB since that's what this laptop comes with, which really isn't enough for anything these days.
---
Blizzard never claimed that the demo was going to be accurate.
---
Odd. My first priest I leveled was Holy. Second was Disc. Don't like shadow since to me, it feels like a wanna be warlock, and if I wanna play warlock, I'll play a warlock, not a wanna be. Haven't had any issues or problems leveling a priest from 1 to 60 as either Holy or Disc.
---
This!
---
Is there an existing tier list (or at least something with a vague notion of tiers) for all of the specs of classes in different content?
---
E.g I'm interested in seeing how Destruction vs Affliction warlocks compare for PvP, and how Elemental vs Enhancement Shamans compare for raids. I know it would be very subjective but I'd at least like to see what's meta vs what's a meme build
---
This post is stupid. 
---
I bet there is a whole lot of people that enjoy the things you listed, including me. Its a very old game.
---
Play what you want, don't let the min-maxers put you down!
---
I think the fear of feral druids are completely unfounded my man. They are great off tanks and in many fights they can out perform a fury warrior at the task. I think you will have no problem having a more casual raiding guild bring you on board. Maybe the pure progression raiding guilds will poo poo, but I feel like if you want to be part of that community you're doing nothing but running the most optimized spec's/class compositions anyway.
---
Pure dps feral though....
---
There was an [interview](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-13-after-fourteen-years-of-world-of-warcraft-infrastructure-isnt-a-limitation) a year or so ago that touched on it. Of course they wont share their specifics, but you can get a basic idea:
---
&gt; World of Warcraft hasn't existed on any specific infrastructure for years. What we shipped on looks nothing like what we have. 
---
"Infrastructure" being the server blades of old.
---
&gt; We don't tie ourselves to one specific infrastructure. We all know what WoW looks like right now from a technology standpoint, internally, but what it's going to look like in a few years depends on what the needs of the game are and what has happened in the world in terms of technology innovations that we might be able to leverage as well.
---
Thank you elitist assholes. May they be proud of what they've done.
---
If the servers are crashing, theres nothing to stop you from leaving the house and just going to enjoy a movie, or to the bowling alley or to your local water park man.
---
Its not the end of the world. You still have the day off. Not sure why everyone acts like the day is wasted if servers are down.
---
I remember one of my friends had a 2h enhancement shaman with The Unstopppable Force in vanilla and he got some pretty decent numbers in pvp
---
Shadow melts faces in PvP

Skyrim.

Again...

Sure, if you are the inferior alliance
---
11 feb 2005*
---
&gt; I seem to remember getting my character to 60 then to 70, then to 80.
---
Unless you did that in the 1-20 zones which are the only ones even in consideration for sharding, then its a completely worthless point.
---
&gt; No it's not unplayable. It's really crowded but, not unplayable. 
---
Standing on top of an item that spawns every 5 min and competing with 100s of players for HOURS is not gameplay.
---
&gt;I have no interest in compromising the fidelity of a fully immersive continuous world.
---
Sharding has no impact on this unless you can show otherwise
---
You shut your dirty mouth
---
Blizz: Those fish are 100% off limits and totally not allowed for transmog.     
---
     
---
Also Blizz: [Have you guys seen this new mace we made?](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163928/stinkrot-smasher)
---
This is Classic WoW. So no, it will not be in the game. It would completely ruin the point of this wonderful game.
---
[They confirmed at Blizzcon that Group Finder will not be in Classic.](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1935)
---
Not my proudest fap I will admit.
---
if you took the time to ensure you always had rested exp, yeah, but it would definitely add a lot of time to the challenge. Bellygrub and RFK/RFD parts would probably be the best times to take it slower and go for the Rested exp though, since that part of the leveling grind will be slow and rely on you fighting either a quest mob with a longer respawn time or going into dungeons and avoid non-boar mobs.
---
Work work
---
Morrowind!
---
Work is da poop!
---
NE Druid, skinning and herbalism, grinding beasts to level.
---
not the whole gnome, only the fifth finger of the gnome gives it that perfect zest
---
Yeah I'd rather see Classic continue and just be improved upon. New content can be added without it getting bogged down by what happened in expansions.
---
Considering that that early, it was a 15 man raid/dungeon, you certainly did not "always 5 man UBRS". You are missremembering.
---
There was plenty of porn in 2004. Sad, lonely guys just like the direct interaction and attention of what is in their mind a girl. Same as how camgirls can make tens of thousands while porn is freely available.
---
A lot of people love classic but aren't into the idea of playing on a private server as they aren't guaranteed to last and whatnot.  I'll bet there are a ton of players that will jump in that aren't currently on private servers.  A good chunk of my friends are excited for classic but won't play with me on a private server.
---
Oh I'm not rolling a druid again.  I got to dps, I got to tank frequently, in every raid tear eventually.   I am over power shifting.
---
I would recommend druid to anyone.   Unless they want to play caster.
---
You dweebs sure like defending each other. You guys should get out a little instead of jerking off all day to some 15 year old expansion that your never gonna get a max level toon on
---
I've been too lazy to put a new OS on it and stuff haha, i got it free off a friend
---
I once ran a bg, jokingly told everyone to type /camp, and ended up forfeiting as i was the only player left on horde
---
imagine them giving a date and it's delayed.
---
Now you're just spewing nonsense. It stacked back then, there's no reason for &lt;Curse&gt; to use it on Loatheb otherwise, especially since tank healing is limited on Loatheb.
---
It is listed by [multiple](http://web.archive.org/web/20081222181901/http://elitistjerks.com/f81/t22705-dps_compendium/) [TBC](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202181137/http://elitistjerks.com/498690-post35.html) [sources](http://www.tankhard.com/2008/06/18/curse-of-recklessness-mechanics/) that Faerie Fire and CoR stacked in TBC.
---
Oh, and did I mention that **Faerie Fire and Curse of Recklessness only stopped stacking in [patch 3.0.2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.0.2_(undocumented_changes))?** This was part of a major raid buffs and debuffs overhaul.
---
&gt; Faerie Fire and Faerie Fire (Feral): Armor reduction no longer stacks with Sting and  Curse of Recklessness.
---
So we know that it stacked during TBC and stopped stacking during Wrath. You're alleging that it didn't stack during Vanilla despite providing absolutely 0 proof. The buffs didn't magically start stacking when TBC dropped, otherwise someone would have noticed and contributed to any of the lists of undocumented changes. 
---
TL;DR they stacked until Wrath, you're providing no proof for what you're alleging.
---
Really? Dropping 7500 on a Crown of the Kings? What boss you stuck on lol
---
I did one of Alkaizers or Kripps early farming routes and manage to get a nearly perfect warrior set helm, sold it on the RMAH for 150 bucks, paid for my game and expansion. 
---
But I only sold it because the RMAH was terrible for the game, and it was my cash out option. When you spent more time flipping items on the AH for better gear than you could get in 1000 hours of farming, then there is something extremely wrong with your game.

cries in unholy dk
---
Str is good but considering 
---
20Str is only 40ap 
---
While 20 agi is 
---
1%dodge
---
1% crit
---
20 ap. 
---
And armor 
---
str is weighted less then agi even for cat dps. 
---
What should be noted is spread stats on gear like 
---
+10 str
---
+10 agi 
---
+10 sta
---
+10 int 
---
+10 spi 
---
Is fantastic for druids because int = more powershifting.
---
You have 1 fucking job.   Im sure youll fuck it up
---
Gnomes can remove all *snares*. Hamstring, Crippling Poison, Nets, Frost Novas, etc. Typically your hardest counter is things that snare you.
---
Dwarf is still really good though, it lets you clear Blind, bleeds, and poisons, as well. So you can remove ruptures or rends, serpent sting dot from hunters, the ud spriest dot, and the pesky blind against other rogues.
---
Dwarf racial is 3mins, gnome is 1min cd.
---
So it's kind of what you value more. Personally, I'd rather to have the ability to get out of snares every minute.
---
you are barking up to the wrong tree here. I'm 100% on board with tips out spreading wrong information about his dreadful 'we know nothing' video.
---
The only part that I'm referring to is one of the criminals from Nost admitting that they made the armor values of bosses up by guesswork.
---
It seems like they've really ramped up the Blue posts, though. It's hard to see how they can maintain that until August.
---
They'll continue releasing stuff. Even the next WoW expansion will be within 2 years.
---
In this sub people might think that Classic is a big thing (and it is, for those who'll play it :) but for Blizzard it's absolutely not important, apart from sentimental reasons. It'll not move the needle much in the financial sense. Profit is not the goal of the project. Obviously it'll not lose money (and even bring in a decent amount) and this fact helped greenlight it, I'm sure. But it doesn't have to be grossly profitable. It's not a new game. It's just a small side project of the WoW juggernaut. Let me quote J.A.Brack: "This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important." (https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
Classic *is* a love project for Blizzard. A way to preserve their legacy.
---
What I'm trying to say is that we, the players, need not pretend that Blizzard is in dire need financially and absolutely not have to accept any kind of microtransactions or other changes which would compromise the game. That's a completely unnecessary, defeatist attitude.
---
ROFL
---
When you're farming hundreds of shards per week for raids you will be happy that you need to grind 40 fewer shards because you picked the trinket instead of a staff that will rot in your bank except for the 2 times a year you pull it out to look cool while you dance on the mailbox.
---
Thank you my good sir.
---
Agreed, but blizzard has done some stupid things before lol. Thanks for the response.
---
Holy crap, I remember people doing that!   It was the precursor to mages opening portals to cities and then casting refreshment table over the portals lol
---
Almost all the data given here is mostly useless whit out real hardware information. What can be asserted from given information, You will lack performance in every corner and speaking of gpu...? Intel celeron integrated? Just make your self a service and don't bother to try.  
---
You will need to have a d-GPU at least as powerfull as MX150 2 GB or anything more powerful. Also at least 2ghz cpu is recomended, but more is usually better.  
---
Laptop with amd ryzen 5 2400g (APU) should be ennough to run wow, but it might not be so pretty... oh yeah it's classic graphics... nvm.
---
Being a freelancer rocks. &lt;3
---
Worst part.. We had to use his torch.
---
Plus you can mix in Curse of Recklessness or Curse of Exhaustion (if you're specced for it) to really mess with them
---
I didn't argue about armor values. I argued about armor reduction stacking.
---
is their a limit of only 1 orphan per char, or can I have unlimited?
---
I am personally all for cross realm BG's. Back in the day on Vanilla I remember having to wait sometimes an hour + to get into a WSG match on PvE Garona server Alliance side. Was so nice when cross realm came out and I could just constantly PvP.  
---
I was younger then and in middle school so I couldn't really raid reliably. PvP and battlegrounds were all I did. Huge bummer just sitting by the battle master for an hour waiting for a game.
---
I'm advocating for some kind of compromise system. You don't get to re-use these items every xpac but maybe every 2nd or 3rd. For example there were pretty good cases for bringing back TF and Sulfuras in Cata. Corrupted Ashbringer in WotLK. Atiesh in TBC.
---
Perhaps not Eye of the Beast but Nef's Tear, TF, Ashbringer stuff like that. Continuity is important and fun imo and WoW has never really had it.
---
They are 99% accurate.
---
If you play 3 hours a day and use the trinket on cooldown then you'll end up with 42 free shards per week. If you've ever played a warlock while raiding then you already appreciate what 42 free shards per week means.
---
Would classic have 4 level pvp brackets? Like 50-54 he would players keep their levels? (not be lvl 54 regardless of initial level)
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
What did you have before Nightfall? It looks fucking expensive.
---
Wwat is that dirty ass floor D:
---
Can someone explain this to my stupid self?
---
It's a mace, though.
---
I think the post will be removed if explained, sorry.
---
Shoutout to WC3, the real GOAT game, the original infinitely moddable infinite free content paradise, creator of many genres including the MOBA
---
I think this was good discussion except one guy who got emotional. Nice to see someone in the middle though.
---
toaster brain how about you actually bring up the entire change and not just wigwash nonesense? Recklessness lost the anti fear component with 3.0 hence why there was no reason for it to be allowed on the same target. Not a single word was ever dropped about their armor reduction stacking as it never dig.
---
Yeah...what is this?
---
Honestly for my part as a veteran player. I actually share your view. I want those zones manageable. That being said what terrifies me. Is the new players. Part of what blew my balls off when I first started. Was the fact I was visiting another world. No loading, no sharding, nothing. Just a giant continuous unbroken land mass. Piled in with players to the brim.
---
The inconvenience meant I had to do something I had actually never done before in a video game. Organize with other players and discuss how we are going to solve this problem. In fact I distinctly remember sitting around commiserating with a band of players about how much of a pain in the ass this is and, how we could get around it. 
---
The truth is we didn't. We made friends though because, of our shared experience. It's those connections which drive classic wow. At the end of the day after all. If you show your friend a video of you spamming rank one heal in a raid and, he will have no idea why you love this game. The game play isn't the magic of classic.
---
So lets theory craft a day one with sharding. I load in the world is manageable. I begin doing all of my quests solo. Why? because it's possible to and I want to go fast. I periodically group with other people for one or two crowded quests before we drop and, go our separate ways. Other then the slow speed of leveling. This is how you retail and, no one likes it.
---
Now lets take out sharding. I zone in to Durotar, look around and see 9000 other people. Whats my first move?... Make a group of course, no way I can solo this that would be impossible. What does that group do? They plan about how to try to solve this problem (they cant lol.) but they try though and, during the struggle. They make friends having a blast trying to tag mobs from other groups competing to get anything. Pretty soon rivalries rise and alliances form. This is magic. This is a spell being cast on the user. After that happens. Game play is put in it's proper place as secondary to social connections. Which as I have said is the magic of classic. This is why so many people are #nochanges. Modern devs are fooling with things they don't understand.
---
Don't forget 8-10 hour queues. You queue at night and hopefully get to play before work in the morning.
---
Neither did I, I was just making the point that it showed them a lot to work on. Which like a beta would, give them opportunity to find stuff they may not have. That could be through oversight, hardware, specific conditions, and software ie drivers
---
You're welcome :)
---
Lol I was wondering why this post didn’t make any sense. Thanks. No labels visible on the Apollo app.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt; | EU PvP Server, Horde | Casual PvE raiding guild**
---
**Introduction:** 
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. 
---
One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
**Expectations from members:**
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment. 
---
**Raid Information:**
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
Send me a message or contact Wolfie#2101 on discord for more information!
---
I'm pretty sure back in vanilla you needed specific classes to do some dungeons, or it would help at least, random dungeon finder would probably end up in a bunch of dungeon deserters
---
Min/maxing makes the game easier and less stressful.
---
There are some videos on YouTube.   That Gobind great detail.
---
But the guest is the 5 weapon skill will require you to only need 5% hit for your yellow attacks to always land.
---
Anymore after that, raises your Crit cap and what not.
---
But I've also heard that there are some questions about the formulas used and if they will work like that in classic.
---
Not without a videocard.
---
Would be like getting on a bike without a chain. Sure it's going to roll down a hill but it isn't doing what you asked it to do.
---
This is true there is a vendor.  Not sure if she was there in Vanilla or not but I think she sells either that mount or a tiger pet I think
---
But you always go improved haste right? The ability makes it that you cannot be slowed or binded during the duration? Or am I mistaken?
---
I linked you proof that the armor reduction stacked. You linked diddly shit. Have a good day.
---
Zelda - Breath of the Wild!
---
&gt; Unless they want to play caster.
---
b...b...but what about Moonkin?
---
Ele is arguably one of the most OP spec's in pvp
---
So many of those were originally Warcraft 3 icons...
---
8gb is dirt cheap, along with 16gb. That extra $100-200 spent is a huge difference.
---
Division 2 and Anthem
---
Agreed. Like how Classic fucked up when warlock pets are dismissed when summoning a new one
---
You not understanding what Vanilla was like doesn't equal private servers being correct. Using /sit to build charges as a paladin didn't work in vanilla either but surely you are under the impression that it "should".
---
It's funny that people constantly discuss and meme about all the other specs on this list, but literally NOBODY tries to make a true "arcane mage"
---
The one that makes the Red go splat.
---
That they will get mob reactions to immunity as wrong as the pservers have all gotten them.
---
Haha I'm just joking.   I actually started leveling full on noob mode.   Head to toe nature's wrath gear and I'd wrath spam like a boss!   I go to early 30"s doing this haha.
---
Hunters are actually damn good in instances. Just remember to turn off growl in the instances. DO NOT say "But my pet can tank the mob" even if it's true. Reason is quite simple from my own experience when I play a tank.
---
As a tank, I do know if I've got aggro on a mob, or if I don't. If I don't have aggro, I have NO idea as to who else in the party has that aggro. So my immediate response to losing aggro on a mob is to taunt it back to me. After all, that mob just may be about to head off to the squishy priest or mage. So if your pet grabs the aggro, you just made me waste a taunt which is on a cooldown. And if another mob then goes haring off to the healer, I don't have that taunt available. It's perfectly OK and desirable for your pet to get into the melee and increase the group's DPS. But leaving Growl on is most definitely NOT OK.
---
I would advocate for a beta because I want to play haha
---
But from my semi professional opinion would say we arent getting what we would like
---
The que was the worst but, Sharding will not prevent that.
---
/r/dataisugly/
---
It was a tradition in my guild to have anyone who was doing this fight for the first time to do exactly this.
---
Minecraft MMO server called “Wynncraft”, has a couple thousand players, reminds me a lot of vanilla wow, especially the quests, and is really well made. Additionally OSRS hasn’t left the second monitor for the last couple months.
---
&gt; The goal of the project is to bring back the game, not the experience
---
I disagree 100%. The experience is what made vanilla special. It could have been a Kerbal Space Program MMO and it would have still been special if they got the experience down the way Blizzard did for WoW.
---
Craft whizbang
---
Reusing a reply to answer this more completely. 
---

---
To a certain point. U normally had a latency around 300ms. Even raiding mc was possible. But Razorgore on the other hand....oh boy....no chance.
---
Unstoppable Force of course! To get to exalted with Frostwolves I think I rocked the blue one from Princess in Maraudon.
---
I'd argue that 6-7k peaks probably represent like 20k people who log regularly.
---
Ok, bring back 1.0 paladins and scrap the broken 1.1x class. #nochanges afterall.
---
I think one of her drops is prebis or close to it (boots?)
---
Get used to a lot more fall damage in Classic. Seems to be the "go to" mechanic of a lot of mobs in AQ, MC, etc.
---
I am absolutely terrified that there will be cross server battlegrounds. It is my dealbreaker.
---
&gt; there was a female in the guild that used Vent and I feel like she was in the clique and got female privileges
---
I raided in a guild on (popular pserver) that had a "no girls allowed" policy. Not because the guildmaster was sexist against women, but because the mouthbreathers in wow just can't keep their shit together when there's a girl in vent. I've seen enough such drama go down to think that he wasn't totally wrong...
---
lol
---
The did say all "dps" classes lol.
---
Who the hell builds an entire cathedral first, on the promise that he'll be paid in full afterwards?
---
What an idiot! I'm glad we ripped him off... Now, gimme that cruel barb you.
---
&gt; It becomes mentally offensive how much of an echo chamber this subreddit is.  
---
Im not here to offend, but to discuss.  
---
if you chose to be offended by something i've said, maybe don go out on forums, where everybody is able to speak and write freely  
---
&gt; And pserver players are baddies who troll. 
---
Whatever
---
&gt; And blizzard is even imulating the content releases to the tune of pservers 
---
You know that these content release phase where included in Vanilla, and that Pservers didnt come up with this idea , right ?
---
&gt; It is because of us 
---
Its because the fans!, regardless is you play on a PServer.
---
check out  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/)
---
Yea I would really like to get a feel for it on their servers beforehand too. I just want aware there were tools now a days for testing so thoroughly. I recently read through The Wow Diary and was still in that mindset of all their alpha and beta tests.
---
lol no. Are they really still selling laptops with 4gb of ram?
---
Wasn't there an improved sprint?
---
Yes it will, that's why they're using sharing. Fit 10k players on a 2.5k person server so that it remains populated when 7.5k of those people are tourists who quit in 3 days.
---
Went to Maraudon in a group where was ret-pally tanking. Balance druid healing. Shadow priest, survival hunter and Arcane mage dpsing. It was fine. Healing for the balance had it's downs but the run was so much fun and also quite painless. I played the arcane mage. This was back in the vanilla.
---
wow i remember my GM playing this trick on us.
---
Beauty of playing horde.
---
Because they had to rush it for Blizzcon.
---
Depends on how a few mechanics of their kit actually works in real classic. But in general yes
---
Hammer of Wrath is so much epic when you get that first crit-kill after 40+ levels of bullshit.
---
Can you do another info post regarding the ratio of classes in these 40 man raids vs. overall server population class ratios? I'm curious if they are about equal or if some class are still over/underrepresented and therefore would have a harder/easier time getting a raid slot based on these ratios.
---
I do
---
6 hours to 10 is not out of the question for a brand new player. If you do quests as you receive them then you will be running back and forth revisiting the same areas multiple times, and you lose a lot of time just running.
---
Vanilla wow does not respect the player's time and will waste it at any chance the player allows.
---
This is a no go
---
Waiting a question about flying mounts.
---
Isnt classic running on legion engine from 2016 though?
---
I actually primarily use this weapon on my shaman for priv servers. I will try this out and let you know.
---
5 most?   
---
Warrior.   
---
Warrior.  
---
Mage.   
---
Hunter.
---
Hard pass
---
Yep, friends doing 150 runs. Gotcha.
---
Is this an out-of-season april fool's joke?
---
It only procs when using abilities / auto attacks to give an extra auto attack. But thats only for thr mainhand. In the offhand there wont be a chance for it to proc off of abilities, only the mainhand can.
---
There was a big one where you could fish up legendaries in ZG in the right spot with a specific set of actions.. IIRC it was ashbringer or some GM weapon.
---
Thought about trying a server like this. Maybe I'll check it out!
---
Classic!
---
Lovely choice
---
Whats wrong with SP? Nice spec
---
My experience playing WoW is going to be mostly impacted by the people I’m playing with, not my faction. If my friends are going to be playing on one faction then that’s the faction I’m going to choose, I don’t see any reason why I would ever choose to miss out on playing with my friends.
---
Can never go wrong with that
---
Well, obviously no person that wants to (and can) spend more hours playing would join such a server. So you'd be left with just the people that are time restricted (Including me. Young kids don't afford too much time to play). Factor in us time restricted people that don't want to limit ourselves because our time to play may not be consistent and what if our 3 hours we can play in a day aren't within the server limits? I think you'd end up with a tiny population. I'd rather be behind the leveling curve and let life dictate when I play than be even with everyone but be a slave to the time the server decides I can play.
---
I love you.
---
By the time you get Ironfoe, you'll see 10 hands of justice drop.
---
Rofl, that's a really good onomatopoeia for it.
---
It's so good. Feels like a new game every time I start it up.
---
This is one of the things that made Classic so great, a combination of items that gave you this kind of bonus would never be allowed to exist in modern MMOs.

* Enjoyable community 
---
* Helpful friendly core
---
* Relaxed
---
* Sociable
---
* Sensible
---
We are coming from a family &amp; friends core of active knowledgeable players looking to play the game we love and enjoy so much. We intend to grow this guild and raid completing all content in a timely manner. We have extensive vanilla experience and played since Vanilla, as well as have a fair amount of private server experience. We believe in a minimum drama based environment where its just friends hanging out, and intend to keep it so.
---
Looking for any players that want to join us, we will be more than happy to teach anything we know, Old school and new players alike we hope to create an enjoyable environment for all.
---
Feel free to send me a PM on reddit for more info. We will be updating and perfecting both this message and further recruitment channels.
---
4 friends to do the same dungeon with you ~100 times, long after they've stopped needing anything from it?
---
2h isn't bis for anyone. nightfall being the only exception.
---
First there is no insta win button against any class. You’re still gonna get whooped on by warriors. 
---
Second perception is amazing against other rogues and druids. Not as frequently used as escape artist or possibly stoneform, but far from useless. 
---
I played a rogue to 85 and I went with gnome. Escape artist is great but being so small is probably a bigger advantage.
---
One, maybe made popular by the nogginfogger films, was that there was a way to get to the emerald dream using wall jumping and/or the portal by the green dragon world boss. Tried for a few hours im happy to say.
---
Doesn't *exactly* mean you'll get a less rare item, guaranteed. It just means you were lucky before, and might be again. 
---
That's like saying you'll win a 'Spin the Wheel' game guaranteed just because you won the lottery.
---
You won't be able to solo King. Best bring another hunter with you. They changed the API in TBC and I'm sure it's improved since then. Splitting the Mage and King won't be possible with Legion being their core for Classic.
---
I know, they don’t make friends like they used to, huh.
---
Slow 2h auto-attack wind fury proc crit on a clothie. Never gets old.
---
Me too, that set is ugly as hell but we're basically forced to use it till AQ.
---
This is unnecessarily badass.
---
Yes, 12 points deep in the combat tree. Which most people didn’t put more than 8 points unless they PVP’d with swords/maces.
---
the tier 2.5 hunter set is covered in +damage/healing in classic.
---
&gt; Thank you elitist assholes. May they be proud of what they've done.
---
Well it's true, what do you want us to say? It's detrimental to the spirit of the PuG rolling against a ret.
---
With full / near full prebis you can duelwield.
---
Elder Scrolls Online. Hadn’t picked up the game for 3+ years but really like the changes they’ve made to the game and really enjoying it
---
&gt; others say that it's 0.04 per point, and thus nets you something like 0.2% hit rating.
---
This is for pvp.
---
Ahh, I came in late to the rogue class.
---
it's 6, not 5.
---
i was thinkin to do 2 Man tribute runs as rogue with a druid or a another rogue, so i have this questions but it consert about time, and most specifict gold/hr, how much time do you take to do a full run as hunter in solo?, are you able to get instace locked? how much gold per hour is it taking in consideration the invs pots, charges etc.
---
Wait rogues used maces in Vanilla?
---
Woa woa woa.
---
Honestly the only change I would like to see is a guild Bank anything else can stay
---
Firstly I ass pulled 9K people. I doubt blizzard will be duplicating nost's super server. That being said. There will be no tourists. They will stay and retail will die. It's a bad game and classic is better. If you think retail is better stay in retail. Please keep your peanut butter out of our chocolate.
---
Never tried EQ. Hope you are enjoying it :)
---
Warrior mage rogue hunter
---
Trying to finish Divinity: Original Sin 2 before classic. Also BotW.
---
Damn, surprised I didn't hear Windfury here yet, at least to my knowledge. I've never actually experienced the joys of windfury, since I never really play melee dps.
---
Darkest dungeon looks so good. I just need to set time aside and dive into it.
---
That's what snowballs were made for
---
I feel the only server crashing will be the streamer servers.
---
Oh I thought the decimal was rounded down.
---
It's pretty obnoxious how your bubble takes you out of combat..
---
As a Frost Mage, you actually put 31 points into Arcane so it's more Arcane than Frost.
---
Tried ESO recently. Solid game but just didn't hold my attention for some reason. Hope you enjoy it!
---
The difference is they created a game, not an experience.
---
It's up to us to experience the game the same way all these years later, if they design it around how the most vocal experienced the game, we'd end up with dreamer garbage (again)
---
You mean improved sprint? It doesn't make you immune but activating sprint cancels your slows. However this spec basically sacrifices cold blood and 30% critical damage bonus on spells. so a LOT of damage lost.
---
This brings up an interesting question: Will pug raids be a thing for classic? 
---
I rarely saw pugs in vanilla for raids like MC / BWL / AQ. Just getting into a raid that could clear a few bosses in MC usually meant you were apping to them as a recruit, and guilds usually had DKP systems in place to funnel loot to regular raiders. 
---
What do people think will happen in classic? Will everyone's familiarity with the raids make raids more common?
---
Can't go wrong with single player. Enjoy!
---
Thats not how the queue works. Queuing is done on a number of active connections basis to the server, meaning having 3k players is having 3k players. This is why the queue happens BEFORE selecting a character. It doesn't matter where they are in the world. Basing the queue on dynamic information dependent on player locations and a sharded zone (Which is STILL the same server mind you, just sectioned off to reduce client lag, network congestion, and respawn deprivation), would require not only changing how queuing works in any version of wow, but also changing general multiplayer game server standards for a connection queue.
---
Yeah but do you really need 3 months+ for that? If they released them a week in advance that'd still be enough time to plan and tell everyone where you're playing.
---
Ironfoe. Woa there.
---
*thats a hunter bis*
---
I think retail has its fun. Just not for me atm. I hope you enjoy it :)
---
Or even just one mob of bullshit. Miss... Parry...Miss...Dodge... Oh a hit... miss...   ...500 dmg hammer of wrath!
---
You don't want to Dual wield as a war.. you have alot of down time as it is. Because you will be missing alot with dual wielding and suffer your damage your better off with a 2h
---
Dual wielding hasn't really ever been a thing. i've seen FEW fury warriors make it through vanillia raiding. but if you are determined to try fury i believe you can do it like around level 20? (not 100% sure)
---
TUF isnt as good as the two i mentioned though, right?
---
&gt; For me, I always remember hearing there was a druid, that reached rank 14, and kept rank 14, for over a year, purposefully farming insane amounts of honor to make the grind harder for everyone else. 
---
Seems like this would lead to... death?
---
Rogues beat warriors easily lol

Perception is meh, in order to actually use it you need to know someone is in the area. It's not useless but it's certainly not comparable to the others.

Helllll yeahhhhhh WmW babyyyy

**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance** *(PvP or RP-PVP if they will be available)*
---
*Are you from Norway or Sweden? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children? Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:** Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities. Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids, going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept. Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week, there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members. Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:** In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.

You want at least a GeForce GTX 750 Ti graphics card or comparable. And a Intel Core i5-3330 3.0GHz processor or comparable. The better you get the better the experience.
---
Don’t know what your budget is but this: https://www.amazon.com/8th-Gen-i5-8300H-GeForce-FireCuda-Windows/dp/B07BP9QG2J is what I would recommend.
---
Oh oops.
---
Warrior/rogue/mage/hunter/Wildcard. Priest maybe? Top 3 will definitely be warrior/rogue/mage.
---
Ult or melee? Loving both
---
One of the greatest games ever in my opinion :)

&gt; How can anyone plan their vacation?

People don't usually plan a vacation based on a video game launch

---
Ha, just watched this yesterday. Props to this guy though.
---
Vanilla tanking is 90% about threat, so if you plan to do raidcontent as a Pala tank then you'll need a group that either knows how to deal with low threat tanks or simply dont do enough threat themselves for it to become a problem. Dungeons will be easier, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for tanking in raids.
---
Huntards for sure
---
Hope you are enjoying it! Classic will be amazing!!
---
I mean battle groups started showing up once the queues just simply stopped popping in some servers due to faction imbalance... I don't see any reason to have them before that point
---
I think priest is a fair assessment. I think there are going to be a lot of priest heals this time around.
---
Correct, just a lot easier to attain.
---
The question is, on which device? ;)
---
I got ironfoe on one of my various alts. Dunno wich but i got it,  since it is on my mace collection
---
Also side reddit question. What does the braketed [S] at the end of your name mean?
---
How is the Division? Only heard bad things about anthem :(.
---
4 is enough but you sacrifice the ability to basically do anything else than voice coms and wow at the time.
---
Do it. I got hooked and even after unlocking all the achievements like to goof around in it.
---
Get the nightfall axe at level 60 and you have a better chance at making a spot as enh
---
Just isn't worth it in Vanilla. Arcane Blast made Arcane A LOT more fun to play imo. Actually loved Arcane in IC progression.
---
1 feral druid tank, 3 dps warriors and a priest healer will compose the majority of 5-man content I guess
---
I've actually had those on my rogue on ely****. Although thrash blade is a bad OH weapon I was still rocking dps charts
---
F
---
Yeah. I am hoping to see more people picking up priest.
---
They can, most of the best weapons aren't maces though. Ironfoe is the best option if you want to go with maces.
---
Warrior
---
Ultimate. I've played melee to death.
---
Arcane Power (30% increased damage and mana cost) and Presence of Mind (next spell instant) both had three-minute cooldowns.
---
WoW is a very easy game overall, providing you read the spells you learn.
---
Yeah, but then you hear about Angwe and find it was actually true.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/meet-world-of-warcrafts-most-notorious-ganker/
---
Yes before changes were made to diminishing returns, mace stun combined with everything else rogues had made it quite infuriating to be on the receiving end.
---
It was but on a smaller scale. We used the EJ forums and would figure out ways to communicate with other high end players if we had class theories. YouTube and Google existed but not like they are today and there wasn't a platform for Professional YouTubers/Streamers so there wasn't any money in being incredibly charitable with in game/class mechanics.
---
Theorycrafting wasn't widely accepted until TBC when the game became more stable. They changed class mechanics dramatically a few times during Vanilla so it was very hard for a casual player or 1-2 day raider to keep up with their class.
---
Maybe this is one of final push I  needed to start making classic videos. That and acgually learn how to make a video...or what to made a vidro a out. Thank you.
---
Only in arms, and you aren't really rocking a 1h sword if you're specc'd arms. If you are, it's sub-optimal whatever you are doing anyway.
---
I came here to laugh at you
---
1k is a large amount at the start. By the time you're using Flasks, literally months in, you've banked a lot of gold if you're an active player. Your guild is starting to sell loot runs if you're actually at content where Flasks make a difference. People bitch about repair bills for instance but the reality is raiding is "free" money once you stop wiping. You make a decent chunk of change clearing raids if you aren't dying (I knew people in vanilla in bad guilds who were always broke due to repairs but they also didn't progress past BWL). PvP and random reputation grinds are basically the only two activities you engage in where you aren't increasing your net worth in some way. Hardcore PvPers will have "grind banks" for this reason, where they save up a bunch of mats/gold to fund the rank grind in advance, because once you get to the 11 to 14 grind you aren't doing anything else at some point. 
---
But an active raider in a good guild is playing 10-20 hours a week, or more!, for months. You're making money that entire time. By the time a AQ40 or Naxx comes out you should have net positive by quite a bit in the gold department.
---
This would barely run Vanilla in the day. 
---
Also - Max RAM supported 8TB, rofl.
---
You can want a new Blizzard *experience*. Look out for any of their new games. Maybe even ask for a new *experience*. (I wouldn't hold my breath but that's just my personal opinion.)
---
But the goal of *Classic WoW* is not to provide a new *experience* for you. It's to bring back Vanilla WoW. I've even linked the *opinion* of a perhaps quite important figure at Blizzard... :)
---
As others have said, Classic is Vanilla, the game. It's up to you to create new experiences with it.
---
Civ 5 and Dying Light.
---
One of the most fun run in Vanilla wow was a Sunken Temple run with me playing my holy paladin alt heal/tanking the whole instance with similar [holy-prot-spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxdMxoZV0xh) like that. i got feral(cat) druid, surv hunter, sub rogue and frost mage in a group with me. it was so much fun and we were successful as long as i didn't get feared. It happened few times, but we downed the temple after few unlucky wipes.   
---
The utmost hardest part was convincing the feral druid(cat) that it can be done. Now that i think it there was something why the feral was not able to tank it, perhaps he/she saved gold by learning the most necessary skills? Might be, but it was so much fun tank and heal same time!
---
Long live angwe.
---
I believe it's been more or less confirmed that it's lower than on Pservers. There's been posts/discussions about how they more or less realized it was too high on certain servers. No one really knows though.

"#nochanges"

"hurrr durrrrrr Ok, bring back 1.0 paladins and scrap the broken 1.1x class. #nochanges afterall."  
---
Do you recognize anything about yourself here?
---
You think then, they'd let me flame shock rag in the face?  🤪
---
I used Abacus of Violet Odds and I think an hourglass-themed trinket by the end of Kara.
---
The UBRS comparison makes a lot of sense. Gearing to start Kara was pretty easy overall, honestly other than hoping for the correct instance drops I feel like the hardest part was the Aldor/Scryers rep grind.
---
That was not my experience, I was the 3rd or 4th hunter in my guild to get it and I still had it well before AQ.  Maybe I was incredibly lucky? Maybe you were incredibly unlucky? Probably somewhere in the middle.

World of Warcraft: Terminal Disease Edition
---
Yeah I just thought the idea was to only kill boars and do nothing else xD
---
&gt; In a kit designed to have an answer for a variety of situations, Vanish is the bread and butter. 
---
In terms of "bread and butter", you usually refer to something used more often than every 5 minutes.
---
&gt; if they design it around how the most vocal experienced the game, we'd end up with dreamer garbage
---
which will be the result of #nochanges as people move on to a game that is "more fun" if blizzard doesnt hit the sweet spot. hybrid pigeonholing is a major problem and the new generation of gamers will look at a game where players of any of the "broken" specs are ridiculed and shunned as a game not worth the effort.
---
It would be so hard to form grps. No world pvp, no time to farm gold  no time to even use the ah  progression would be decades
---
No source because it's not confirmed. I would guess they'd start with 8 debuff slots and then 16
---
TIL a Rogue camping Menethil for 4 months is the same as a Druid holding Rank 14 for over a year.
---
My favorite was having a Hydrocane, camping in lakes, and PvP'ing people from the lakes and they can't figure out where I'm shooting from (hunter).
---
Thrall leveled Durnholde on his master who "raised him"...shows how much you know of raising our offspring lol.
---
Aedelas Blackmoore raised Thrall under human tutelage but also made him fight in the Gladiator pits to win him money. Not as rosey as "It worked for Thrall..."
---
That's evil... and brilliant
---
If only the times worked :/
---
you seem to be knowledgeable so I'll ask you this,
---
Say that I play an Orc or a Human with "Edgemasters" (that adds 7 extra weapon rating), how much hit rating will I have at 312? I'm assuming that it will be around 6-7% hit rating, and thus will make me only require 2% more hit to get hit capped?
---
You're looking for a solution to equalize people who don't have much time to play with people who have too much time to play.
---
Your solution does not consider that some people may only be able to play two days a week (say during the weekend) and so that player is limited to 6 hours per week, whereas others that can put in time every day are still able to put in 21 hours per week.
---
I understand what you are trying to argue. To make changes so the game feels how it felt.
---
I think the problem is that people want not just the vanilla experience, but also the "same game". 
---
It's a mix of good game design and nostalgia. Like if blizzard offered to redo all the quests so that we wouldn't know any of them on the top of our head(assuming that blizzard could actually recreate the same style and design of quests ofc). Then we would have something that's closer to the feel of vanilla because you didn't know what you were doing, but people want both the good design of classic, but also the nostalgia , and redoing all the quests would mess with nostalgia. 
---
I hope you understand my point here. We need to please players both in terms of good gameplay, but also nostalgia.
---
Around 160, freshly recruited (~4 months), very active on Discord.
---
I think it has more to do with WoW's overall popularity than anything else and the rest are just the natural symptoms of that. Things like the Activision deal and just the overall tailoring to a more casual audience. And it happens with a lot of things too, beyond video games, when things get too big they get watered down and overly simplified. Then once the big money/shareholders get involved, the product just wants to appeal to largest possibly audience which is a doomed philosophy. It's impossible to make something for everyone, it's best to know what audience your targeting and to make the best game for them.
---
Why are so many supposed #nochanges people so worried about flight path camping? It's world pvp. It's one of the best things about vanilla.
---
Honestly... no my plate always looked like spandex and my sword was normally larger then me.
---
They frolic around, naked, obviously.
---
Raid times?
---
Not saying it's the same thing.  But 8 hours a day for four months, it's still a level of insane.
---
The division 2 is similar to 1 but it seems a bit tougher to play as cover seems to play a heavier role. Anthem is fine, it got a lot of hate but the overall gameplay is very fun. I used the origin access premiere to play it, put around 100 hours in and will go back for later patches.
---
Ret paladin video who raided through naxx shows hand of rag bis until corrupted ashbringer.  Paladins can scale the proc.
---
Right.  I'm not saying that a good wand doesn't help them level more easily, I'm saying that priests are not top tier speed levelers.
---
Nice, ty
---
These are awesome! Can you add Pally too?
---
*do you think this is a joke?*
---
It just means I'm the one who made the original post
---
&gt; It will in no way effect server que times. The server is still it's own server. They are only going to shard a few zones in it. This will not effect ques because the server is still the same size. 
---
I can confirm this is true, I am a multiplayer gameplay programmer. (Not for an mmo or anything of this scale but I understand the details of general concepts)
---
Just pvp
---
If there are pugs they will be gear screening/spec screening.
---
If you can't get under 10 days you're just inexperienced or inefficient or some combination of those 2. 
---
Hunters are the fastest sure but unless you're fucking around or don't know where to go any class can get 60 in 6-7 days played like the guy said.
---
Warlocks require a lot of micromanagement between your skillset, pet abilities, and timers.
---
Times look good, I’ll check discord out
---
What you aren't considering is that the queue doesn't exist when there is sharding. You can support infinite people in theory. Retail hasn't had a queue in years.
---
Fair.  I guess the idiom got away from me there.  Maybe I should have said it's flavorful and emblematic of the class.
---
Same, though I hope a decent amount run shadow and holy
---
Looking forward to hearing from you!

&gt;Rogues beat warriors easily lol
---
If they have full CD's. Warriors can easily demolish a rogue as well. Retaliation and the Rogue loses or runs away.
---
You spell 'Orc' and 'Undead' wrong.
---
The old alt+f4 worked the same way.  I was always surprised how many people fell for that.
---
Thank you I was actually just looking at this recently
---
Maybe your time could be stored with some diminishing returns
---
Did you just crush up your Classic installation CDs and snort them?
---
Thanks
---
Thanks all for the information. And I would have laughed at this laptop too 💀
---
Darkest Dungeon! And yes Skyrim, still...
---
That's totally just what you think though, the simple solution for blizzard is to provide what people have been asking for, for longer than most realize.
---
Once it's out we can figure out what else the experience needs to work just right... But right now it's time to be pulled we're getting classic at all..
---
The politics of it can wait, I don't need you to fight for my boredom, I'll do it myself when the time comes
---
Assuming bosses or lvl63 mobs:
---
Unfortunately in terms of hit cap weapon skill doesn't scale very well above 305. With 312 your base miss rate will be 5.3, so you still need 6% to be hitcapped.
---
The true power of weapon skill comes into glancing blows however. You have 40% chance for your auto attack to glance, which is an attack that cannot crit(which is big) and does less damage. With more weapon skill, the damage you do on glancing blows is increased.
---
Unfortunately
---
Druid flag carrier.
---
what a unique idea for a thread, never seen one like this before
---
They nerfed 2handers with normalization and buffed dual wielding (added dual wield spec). Bloodthirst also got changed (acted liked a victory rush before). There were a few other things that got changed. But blizz is going with 1.12 abilities and specs so dual wield is best for raiding, especially because mortal strike takes up a debuff slot. And youre right about lvl 20 for dual wielding. Leveling dual wielding isnt that bad as people make it out to be.
---
Middle of the pack here I come!
---
Lol same with me and my Shammy. I didn't know I was supposed to be a healer til I started running 5-mans &amp; raids. 
---
That's why I main a mage now.
---
Very dangerous. Especially with AQ40 gear.
---
Hunter Will be interesting. It's the go-to newbie pick but people totally new to the game will likely be outnumbered by the people that know Hunter DPS falls way off later on. 
---
Rolling one myself, very interested to see what happens with us.
---
Lol I'm not a child or a woman Horde til I die.
---
Really depends what kind of pvp you doing. Most classes has a fairly high skill cap even if you don't see it. But something like warlock rogue mage druid is up there no matter what.
---
How about felstriker + ironfoe
---
Oof missed that one. Have to fix that when i get home. Nice catch. Currently looking at tuesday and thursday. Either 7 to 10 or 8 to 11 est.
---
Unfortunately only works if you're in the same party or raid. Still works in AV though and I definitely intend to use them!
---
Until ragnaros. Then your melee have to have ~290-315 or they're going to get cooked.
---
Engineer Frost Mage followed by engineer Hunter and engineer Rogue
---
Has anyone considered that perhaps Blizz will balance classic better than vanilla and won’t let various specs be total trash?
---
Lol no. Nobody uses fire res on their melee on rag, Jesus the fight is a dps race. You just run out when he does the knockback.
---
You can circlejerk all you like but changes will happen.
---
Or he kites with poisons or sprints or vanishes or blinds.
---
Imagine saying that rogues beats warrior WITH FULL CD's but then immediately talk about using retaliation.
---
Pretty sure I'm in a different country :P UK here.
---
I’ve put some thought into lock. I really enjoyed affliction in the past but not sure how viable it is for vanilla
---
Seems appealing to me.
---
Highlord Kruul tearing up IronForge haha nice, I remember he was in Stormwind City one time and annihilated everyone with those shadowbolt things he casts
---
You will be fine. Everyone needs more friends than they already have in classic. Everyone.
---
what in god's name are you talking about
---
2004; 15 started playing because a bunch of my friends from FFXI were switching and I had loved Warcraft 3
---
2019: I took the research and data analysis skills I learned from 6 years of min/maxing top tier raiding through vanilla to the beginning of Cata and translated it in to a lucrative job where I use the skills I developed to analyze my gameplay to analyze education programs and tell schools how they can improve.
---
No college debt, just hours and hours of trying to see the matrix so my guild and I could beat the next boss.
---
Retail doesnt have queues because they are using a cross-server, ENTIRELY sharded megaserver system. This means your actual connection to a server is actually a connection to a single megaserver (which is actually a collection of multiple different servers networked together and share information as if they were one server. This is a load balancing system.) regardless of your "realm" and your "position" so to speak on that server is entirely dynamic. Since the whole system has a strictly enforced sharding system, network congestion is negligible because a single player will only ever have a dermined maximum number of dynamic objects (NPCs and players) they can see. This means that there are no high congestion areas really, and variable server stress is negligible. BECAUSE of all this, they could safely remove the queue altogether or make it basically impossible to trigger. 
---
That is a fundamentally different system than an isolated server world where, in theory, the entire server population could stand on one location.
---
Thanks for clarifying man,
---
Guess It's gonna be Orc or Human after all.....Man I really wanted to roll a Troll or Night elf, depending on what faction I'll end up picking.
---
If you didnt play back in the day, its a bit harder to get into now with the outdated graphics and steeper learning curve. Community is great though.
---
Yeah, it's a CD too, I know. That's my point. But the Warrior beats the Rogue more often than not. GL kiting a warrior, or killing one with poisons. Blind or Vanish and run are their only options vs Retalation. It 100% shuts the Rogue down. That was my only point. They stand no chance with that one CD. Even without it, the warrior is gonna win unless the Rogue does have full CD's up.
---
The UD racial is the same as the pvp trinket so it's kinda useless on rogues. Orcs 25% stun resist is strong but not as strong as Stoneform and EA
---
I have no doubt that people will pug a lot of raids. On pservers, I have even seen Naxx pugs do a couple wings and I did an AQ pug that killed C’thun. I think it’ll take time, but they’ll happen eventually with some gear screening involved.
---
What class are you playing? I assume warrior?
---
Troll warrior can work just fine in pve really, people usually play orc because it does pvp and pve very well.
---
Okay, that's nuts.
---
If you need this, you have bigger issues
---
Whys that the case?
---
Honestly, raiding hardcore in retail right now is more demanding. Depending on your guild, you might be doing "progress" a week or two in MC and BWL. After that it's cruise control farm raids once you have your MT geared up. AQ and Nax get a bit more dicey for sure, but like others have said, you have like a year to farm for that. Outside of not being able to buy tokens for consumable gold, classic shouldn't be any more time consuming. Guilds were a lot more "casual" back then.
---
Now I understand why pro rogues take Gnome as race. Thank you
---
Using 1 out of your 6 cooldowns to deal with warriors 30 min cooldown is hardly "shutting a rogue down".
---
You put 31 points in Arcane for Arcane Power as a frost mage in MC/BWL and there's 1 mage putting deep frost to debuff the Boss with WC - Winter's Chill..
---
I know, who would want to do that. It sounds more fun than the Only Boars challenge.
---
Hard to say, but I doubt you’ll be ignored if you know people and are good.
---
Eh, it depends on what analysis you use. I would think probably a chi-square works best here in my opinion (well... Fine, let's be fancy and say logistic regression). And I think 800 would be a decent sample size for the nine categories...
---
... Ooh, but it'd have to be stratified by faction. 
---
Yeah, fair enough, 400 for each of the two faction strata wouldn't be a ton of power... But I'm not really sure you even need a a statistical analysis here. Depends on what the hypothesis you want to test is.
---
I want to be in a guild that allows "memespecs" just because I like the idea of beating raid content with less used specs. I want to be guild that is famous or infamous on the server fort beating C'thun with ret pallies, spriests, ele shammies etc.
---
I’d say rogue and mage have always been the highest ceiling classes. They have little room for error in survivability, somewhat difficult rotations to execute perfectly, and tons of CC that with perfect use makes them almost unbeatable. 
---
I’d add Ele and spriest as a second tier because if you’re bad they are terrible. But if you’re really good you can do a lot of dmg, a lot of healing, and cycling between the two can make you really strong. But it’s hard and frustrating due to lack of mobility.
---
Take all private server game play with a gain a salt since their game data isn't accurate. There are some things done commonly on private servers that very few guilds did in Vanilla but when a kill attempt was performed kill we used every consumable and buff available. All the rotations, specs, and debuffs being used on private servers are also identical to Vanilla. We also had Warriors spec'd Fury/Prot for threat. Pserver players seem to use Engineering more in raids but I'm really not sure what else they're doing that wasn't done in Vanilla.
---
Not quite the same as a legend, but a tradition on my server was that a gnome had to pull the beast in UBRS and get punted. 95% of the time it was a mage or warlock so they’d die, but the tanks wouldn’t move on until they did it
---
Warrior, solo, no engi, no potions, with green gear :o
---
More seriously, I would say shaman.
---
I think they would be completely stupid to not have at least a PTR 2 - 3 weeks before release.
---
Not American unfortunately.
---
November isn't Summer in Australia either.
---
&gt; The UD racial is the same as the pvp trinket so it's kinda useless on rogues.
---
Rofl what? They don't share a CD. With the PVP trinket you have one on 5min CD and one on a 2min CD. Just because they both have similar effects in no way means it's useless. Hell, if anything it's better because the UD Rogue has 2 get out of jail free cards at that point. 
---
&gt; Orcs 25% stun resist is strong but not as strong as Stoneform and EA
---
What? Stoneform is okay against other rogues, but damn near useless against anyone else. Warrior doesn't need bleed to win and Warlock can just wait the Stoneform out. EA is okay, but it's got a cast time and only affects movement, not full on stuns.
---
If you had an i3 or i5 then the integrated graphics would be enough but that Celeron? no way...
---
It's not just about blind recreation for the sake of it, the longer game ticks and the old debuff refreshing system added significant depth to the game.
---
Sure, they shouldn't recreate bugs for the sake of recreating them if those bugs really are detrimental to the game, but the two examples you gave are terrible because they're not bugs nor do they cause any glaring issues, in fact, I would argue that these kind of core systems are just about the most important thing to preserve in a recreation.
---
I have to agree that a fully BiS geared warrior beats Rogues
---
Omg, I forgot about the punt!
---
I'm giving easy examples, not walking through every possible scenario of Rogue v Warrior. Warrior wins more often than Rogue.
---
Hmm true never thought about it, damage boost from Arcane Power is so negligible but the only reason why this spec can even remotely make sense is because even in 31/0/20 you can spec into the good shit like Ice Shards and Shatter
---
Affliction isn't great in raids thanks to the debuff limit, but it's a ton of fun in dungeons, solo play, &amp; PVP. After you start gearing up, SM/DS can pull off a stupid amount of sustain with self-healing.
---
Even Kungen said they didn't think about using things like dire maul buffs back then for example so no, not every buffs were used.
---
Sheeped a Devilsaur yesterday un Un'Goro. Didnt even think it was possible but avoided dying and holy sh\*t was it satisfying turning a GIANT T-Rex into an itty bitty sheep.
---
It doesn’t but you can HS in combat.
---
Bestest commen of the day
---
Because youre forced to sit in your chair knowing that at any moment the issues could resolve. Or with enough log in attempts you might get lucky while others still are stuc k at disconnected.
---
Wait, really?.. fucking private servers.
---
Stoneform is used to restealth without dots. And there aren't so many fears on the alliance side. Stoneform is basicly a win button against other rogues and EA removes bind which is good on a 1m cd. The stun resist is strong I agree but the WOTF is kinda overrated
---
But they said Summer 2019...
---
No. Ideally you want your offhand to have the same speed as your mainhand, so when you get a flurry proc, 4 attacks benefit rather than 3, as both main hand and offhand attacks consume a flurry charge, but if your weapons are the same speed, your offhand will hit at the same time as your main hand on the "third" charge. 
---
Besides that, weapon speed is negligible compared to any other differences in your offhand weapon options.
---
Meh, I’m too old now to care. I look forward to my main pally 😁
---
I've been corrected several times on this subreddit already where I forgot or misremembered something. There will definitely be re-learning happening.

Alliance Mage currently looking for a Semi/HC guild raiding anytime between 630p-12a EST Sun-Thurs.
---
I expect to be 60 in two weeks and in MC no later than week three. 
---
If you want my full list of WoW history feel free to contact me but I assure you it’s enough. 
---
I am currently working on a leveling guide to have done by the summer.
---
You cant really compare pserver to the original though, there are some very important things that pservers just do not get correct.
---
You can dual wield as a fury warrior from the moment it is possible to do so. If you wana minmax everything rather than live for the class fantasy do as suggested in minmaxing guides.  For levelling Staffs are sometimes the best option to wield ((staffs got sometimes higher white dmg)) with some gear with high spirit. You will regen hp alot and hardly need to rest between fights. this equates to better xp/h.  
---
I raided trough mc to naxx with many other warriors in our raid group dual wielding the most interesting combos of weapons. some times i specked to tank, some times to dps.   
---
I say, you can do crazy stuff in vanilla. Some people just say these things that "you cant bla bla" because it sounds like they know their stuff. :P Just chill and go full goofy with what ever killing-spoons you find and have fun.
---
Yeah and OG vanilla hit 400k after a month. A success they weren’t ready for. Now the game has at least 10 times the amount of players so good luck going through Northshire.
---
Maybe it would be. The ones I have are lvl 58.
---
This is one of the items I want most in Classic. But with that drop rate, I'll probably have to save up some gold and get lucky on the AH.
---
Well, that was how it worked in retail classic too. Bubble never removed combat, mobs will just keep hitting you.
---
&gt; And there aren't so many fears on the alliance side
---
There are exactly the same number? Warrior, Priest, Warlock. Horde doesn't have access to some special fear ability/class.
---
&gt; Stoneform is basicly a win button against other rogues
---
The other rogue can just vanish/stunlock and wait it out though. Obviously that goes both ways, but if you have the stunlock going, why would you stoneform?
---
&gt; WOTF is kinda overrated
---
Okay...
---
Low effort trolling.  I like it.
---
Technical requirements are not currently available, it is likely you will be able to run them if your PC meets current BfA requirements. See [here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=281321/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-system-requirements-for-windows-and-mac).

---
It’s been a long time since I played and I was only ever casual but I seem to remember Tranquility being only usable in a few situations because it always aggroed everything. 
---
If I was the sole healer in a dungeon (again only ever casual PUG) it was like a button labelled ‘Click here to wipe’.
---
It's fine. You buy gold from other players on your server, it still has to be grinded.
---
Yeah, had to make myself some bacon after watching it.
---
It depends : if you want to min-max your leveling you probably should stay on 2 handers (we still should test it on real Blizz servers before being so definitive about it).
---
However I did it on my warriors (3 in Vanilla) when I had better one hander than 2 handers, I never felt I was gimping myself.
---
It even felt more pleasant, more rage, the mobs were dying fast enough.
---
Forget about it if you play on a PVP server : you really need to be arms with a slow 2 handers (you'll still lose most fights but at least it won't be because of wrong spec :o ).
---
Warrior is way better both at tanking and DPSing
---
You have never played druid meaningfully.
---
no, copy&amp;paste pls
---
Not all servers are entirely sharded. Moonguard,  the RP server, does not have sharding in major social hubs.
---
In raiding youll be expected to heal regardless of your preferred spec. The thing is, if you do your job well and show up for raids eventually when everyone is geared if you wanted to roll as enhance for a night im sure your guild wouldn't mind. Guilds will be farming mc for most of classic for thunderfury so eventually that content becomes trivial.
---
Its important to remember that in classic you play a class not a spec, and you'll do well to be versatile.
---
Ill enhance tanking for 5 mans and i want to try mc one day, but i expect to heal for most of my raid time.
---
They said there will be no balance changes, at least not to start with. Referring to the Blizzcon Q&amp;A session.
---
Yep, Steppenwulf had it nerfed because he couldn't get it. WHILE at the *same exact time* having a 'bug post' saying Empyrean was underpowered because he had it. What a joke and a shit warrior.
---
Orc for sure
---
I need to know if there will be cross realm bgs, I’d also like to know before they are implemented in phase 3. If they are not, I won’t be playing.
---
So you’re comparing a private server that doesn’t know the actual values to what happened 15yrs ago?
---
Yeah, just not *your* changes. And thank Satan for that.
---
Per faction it is warrior, mage, shaman/paladin.
---
Factions combined prolly warrior,mage, rogue.
---
Doubling your gold is easy with alt+f4.
---
pserver have a few things wrong sure since they estimate alot of value but the difference shouldn't be that big, even if the dps were 10% lower (which i seriously doubt really since boss values like armor are often buffed on pservers so it has better chance of being higher) they would still be able to do alot more of what is needed.
---
And if we then take the ridiculous world buff into consideration, the dps would be much higher anyway.
---
Are you expecting a lot of newbies ?
---
The way I see it, people will either be vanilla / pserver veterans or other MMO veterans (including retail WOW).
---
All these people will know how to play a hunter after a few lvl.
---
I don't see a massive influx of people that don't know what a MMO is.
---
Is also a must if you wanna high end raid
---
Affliction is beast in Vanilla. You won't get the massive single hits you see from Destruction builds, but it's still really good. In 1v1 you can fear kite with the dots and the fear is much less likely to break. In BGs you can just spam instant cast dots on everyone you can see.
---
This still works on retail. Tried it during the 10 year anniversary Molten Core raid, and people still fell for it.
---
Gnome. Pink hair, harder to click on, escape artist, looks great nude, taking down Tauren is highly satisfying, you can hide in devilsaur body and ninja skin if you're stealthed waiting for horde to loot, etc etc.
---
I raided as Ele in MC for a bit.  It was fun.  ZG was really fun as Ele.  Wasn't topping meters but I was holding my own.
---
Primarily the technology of the time -- people's PC's were not nearly as optimized for graphics processing, nor was networking technology nearly as good as it is now. 100 Mbit to the home is commonplace now, where back then there were still people on 56k - 6 megabit connections.

And it's not *'moan about how you deserve hand of ragnaros'*.

---
...Wouldnt you rather stay INSIDE when it's cold, and be OUTSIDE when it's hot away from WoW?
---
I don't get the logic.
---
These are all assumptions though. To make a real comparison you would need logs from 14 years ago, but finding them is going to be a feat to say the least.
---
Hey, I want to tank with my shaman  too! 
---
And about the healing oh I know, I've done the hybrid before.  I'm not sure what my end game goals are, but I don't think I want to raid like I used to.
---
Are gold dkp runs still a thing?   That'd be the sweet spot.
---
Listen rogues have to reset a fight by using blind. When facing a dwarf the non dwarf cannot reset the fight so the dwarf rogue has a major advantage.
---
Alliance have less warlocks than horde bc of the 70% UD population

---
I agree, threat is the biggest issue. But keep in mind, for 5-mans, prot pallies have the BEST aoe threat of any class, for a shorter term fight. For bosses, they really have to judge on CD and have the group just wait 3 seconds. But they can keep single target threat on a short fight pretty decently, as well.
---
IDK, i'm not kidding when I say one of the better tanks I've had has been a pally. Granted, the hardest part about ZG is the trash sometimes, and ZG/MC boss fights are WAY shorter. Pallies can keep decent threat, but they have to burn through mana/mana pots quicker.
---
But yeah, anybody hoping to get *a spot* as a pally tank in a raid will be dissapointed.
---
We're talking about on release here, not on near empty zones. There is a 0% chance a solo warrior is doing it in 6-7 days played right out of the gate for a number of reasons, same goes for druids and shamans.
---
For people with planned routes who get nice and ahead early, sure they may get the 5-6 day mark on the better leveling classes but that's going to be an extreme outlier.
---
The end game zones are the same for both, so... :p
---
&gt; the non dwarf cannot reset the fight
---
Why not? Is blind the only reset available to rogues? I thought they had stuns, vanish, sprint, etc. Maybe I'm not remembering properly.
---
Seriously, almost everything is a hunter weapon. It probably would serve a rogue / warrior / paladin / shaman better, but still ... :o
---
Theres a talent that wipes tranq's threat, but yeah. It's tough even in raids, because it only heals your one group.
---
paladins can cleanse fear.
---
so can priests.
---
horror can be bopped but thats tricky if its on a tank.
---
I thought it was supposed to be hard!   Lol. 
---
Crazy.
---
Different rank hearthstones do share a cooldown, but you can hold one of each rank. Having one of each is beneficial on longer fights, but aside from lothaeb isn’t that big of a deal
---
Yeah mostly only good for AV, but every once in while you get someone with lazy pigs auto accept invites enabled
---
Especially when it's talented :(
---
16.July would be way earlier than I anticipated.
---
I would loose my mind if they announce that tomorrow.
---
For warriors if it is atleast 4% procrate (likely, IMO) it's BIS or equal for humans until Naxx. HOJ + Ironfoe is insanely fun.
---
if some people want to power to 60 . why does that bother u at all. go ahead take 1 year to get 60 nobody cares. the hardcore playerbase want to rush to 60 and get the raids done, you are not hardcore then that is all we all will enjoy.
---
Ret is okay, this reddit found a use for them in Raids after all.
---
Every rogue has to use blind as a reset tool. Other stuns are on CD
---
&lt;The Oran'Thul&gt; - Horde | NA | PvP | Hardcore
---
The Oran'Thul is a dedicated, goal-oriented group of hardcore gamers seeking raiders and PvPers for Classic WoW. We host an exclusive guild Classic WoW server designed to eliminate gear and consumable farming, allowing members to practice raid mechanics with unlimited resets.
---
Our plans for Classic WoW include being top guild on our server while still providing an atmosphere that also welcomes more casual players. We intend to have two 40 player raid groups totaling 80 hardcore raider slots. We have a ranking system that provides raid slot and loot priority to those that align with the hardcore play style and plan to show up to MOST raids. For more information, please review a detailed breakdown on our website: https://www.oranthul.com/home/m/49064920/article/4842852

UPDATE: PHASE 2 OF OUR CLASSIC WOW PRIVATE SERVER HAS BEGUN! We have started with Phase 1 content(MC, Ony, Kazzak/Azuregos) and are focusing on teaching new players how to tackle this content. With the success of Phase 1 and the clearing of all content, we are now ready to begin again starting with Molten Core and progressing through ALL content once more. NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO JOIN AND LEARN ALL CONTENT PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH! 
---
While most of this post focuses on the PvE aspect of Classic WoW, we are equally as dedicated to PvP and greatly enjoy crushing the skulls of the Alliance. We have multiple Rank 14 experienced players and will allocate time for premade battlegrounds.
---
-
---
Our core members are extremely knowledgeable of all Classic WoW content and provide an environment where you can learn your class, ask questions and improve your skill set. We have cleared all content in Classic WoW including all world bosses and 15/15 Naxx. Furthermore, we have achieved world-best standing in past MMOs, most notably ArcheAge.
---
If you strive to be the best you can be, know what it means to put the organization first, and want a guild and community to call home from day one, then perhaps this is the place for you. With 15+ years of activity and an absolute 0% chance that we will quit Classic WoW or disband—as commonly witnessed with many other guilds—we offer you unparalleled stability and a place to call home! JOIN US!
---
One of the many projects that The Oran'Thul has painstakingly worked on includes a list of loot from all raid bosses including loot council priorities. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-raid-mc
---
In addition to this project, The Oran'Thul is creating a complete list of pre-BiS and BiS gear for all dungeon and raid content. This list is organized by class and role allowing each player to see the gear that only pertains to their needs. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-pr-warrior-prot

Ik houd ook van koek

*shrug* cuz some people dont know shadow priest is good?
---
... Okay.
---
Giving vis'kag to the tank is a pretty good idea. Threat is important. You really shouldn't be so condescending, especially when you know so little.
---
Stormstrike on an already purged, half-dead clothie.
---
Sheep is probably half the reason I'm making one of my 60s a mage. I love having that utility... best CC in the entire game, I don't have to deal with trapping anything or the obnoxiousness of using sap.
---
You know private server have access to quite a lot of vanilla videos ? (especially on boss).
---
They test their value with characters that have exactly the same gear, buffs that on the video on the same boss, use the same techniques that are used and log the damages then compare to the video. Refining the value until it seem accurate. And when in doubt they buff the bosses values to make it harder.
---
Sure there might be some deviation but it shouldn't be that much.
---
Thanks man appreciate it
---
People are free to do what they want.  I'm just pointing out the irony.
---
That is a remarkably huge assumption.
---
Unbelievably hard to kill. Unbelievably hard to master.
---
can be done with a hunter in blues under 10 minutes. minimal gold investment and u get a bunch of shit per run
---
Any way we could get the talent background art in really high quality? Been looking for desktop background purposes.
---
You don't need to put an OS in it. Just use it as another hard drive in a PC and insert game folders/install them onto the SD drive.
---
All the benefits and none of the fuss :)
---
Trust me, skinning is the worst gathering profession you can have as a healer, because it involves killing stuff. I have a skin/LW resto druid in a TBC server and I hate farming the skins... And this is in tBC, where 1/3 of +healing gear is converted to spell dmg. In vanilla it's much worse.
---
You'd better be a Herb/LW, sell herbs and buy leather IMO.
---
They are also the best gold makers bar none. DM East farm, BRD farm, UnGoro/Silithus elemental farm. Can easily make 100g/hr if you know the places to farm. A bit squishy sometimes, but overall still my favorite class between raiding, pvp and farming.
---
fuck, is that sure that the pathing will be changed from the old version?
---
**&lt;Valoria&gt; - NA / PvP / Alliance**
---
'Ello there, Valoria is not a raiding guild and it is not a PvP guild - it is a guild that caters to all styles of play. Through our Discord community, you can communicate and chat about whatever it is you like to do with others that are like-minded.  
---
*Has a mean ol' orc been camping you for the past hour? -* Post a report in our incident channel and ask for help!
---
*Are you being beaten down by a scary quest mob? -* Ask in our PvE group-finder for other players in the area.
---
*Want to play some battlegrounds with a full team? -* Get together in our PvP channels using the group-finder.
---
We don't judge you based on your class preference either. If you insist upon playing a (b)oomkin, go ahead! We are a casual group that has the same goals as any other focused guild - getting to end-game content and helping our guildmates thrive (albeit less inclined to chain you to your desk).
---
**What do we do?**
---
We will eventually raid, but until then, expect group dungeon runs, events to promote interactions, and plenty of Discord conversations. *Nobody is required to do anything as a part of the guild, as long as you interact in some capacity.*
---
**Who are we for?**
---
If you are someone who doesn't mind a casual environment, but still wants to partake in late-game content or PvP, we are for you. If you simply want to quest until you have no more quests to do, being a part of our guild will still be helpful! If you just want a group to talk with, we are still for you.
---
**Details**

If you're interested or want more information, contact me either on Reddit or on Discord. My time-zone (and therefore the time-zone for reference for guild events) is EST.

I've been wondering if even Blizzard has the actual values anymore.   Maybe pserver numbers will become the "real" numbers.
---
It’s not like getting the rested exp bonus changes the fact that you’re still getting exp from killing boars only, it just means you get more exp per boar. But it is probably better to just get rested exp from being logged out in between sessions rather than try to cheese things.
---
That's australian summer /s
---
People on classicwow will somehow convince themselves that small errors in private servers (which can both be nerfs and buffs ) is gonna make up for doing 200% of the required damage LUL
---
Have you ever played on a private vanilla server or are you just remembering things from 10 years ago?
---
&gt; Release date will be December
---
Someone is really, really lost here
---
That dmg includes the burn phase when the boss takes increased dmg so that number wouldn't be that accurate. The issue back the was that no one got to the burn phase. Also the fight was bugged and tentacles spawned inside walls and stuff.
---
Also off-topic fact: The person who wrote that was Ion Hazzikostas the current Game Director of WoW.
---
Overpower is such an overpowered ability, pun fully intended.
---
It absolutely destroys rogues 99% of the time alone, and is a great extra damage boost while PVE'ing. However it's mostly effective and f eels orgasmic when wielding a massive fuck off two hander and it crits quad digits. Spamming hamstring to trigger Overpower is a way of life.
---
My second favorite would be Flame Blast for the mage. It has a super cool fiery AoE animation and does a decent amount of damage + sets shit on fire.
---
&gt; However I am not sure how confirmed is this 16th thing
---
not confirmed at al
---
No it's not. And anyway all the formula about how each techniques scale with stats and how much damage they should do are known. The only assumption that are made are on thing like boss armor value and these value are buffed on most server to make it more challenging.
---
As long as his quest isn't there, I would love to see Ahab Wheathoof.
---
&gt;when the boss takes increased dmg 
---
False
---
He does not take increased damage, he goes from taking no damage, to taking normal damage.
---
Thanks a lot
---
By the time burning crusade released my server had a decent pug raiding scene, with at least 2 major well known pug groups running through molten core and the 20 man raids every week. I don't know if they ever jumped to bwl or aq. Only like 3 guilds on my server ever even progressed into naxx and nobody ever beat it.
---
Mostly I think the pug groups will be organized by the bigger guilds to fill out alts or to get that ever elusive thundefury for their tank.
---
Phasing - please dear god dont do this Blizzard. If you havent seen it go check out some vids. It seriously jacks the leveling experience.
---
Nerfing farm spots like some of the private servers have done. Makes me a sad panda as a mage. Part of the enjoyment of the game is finding little nuances to stuff like rogues farming BRD, mages aoe farm, hunter DM farm, paly aoe undead farm, etc. Leave it alone IMO.
---
Also do note AQ40 wasn't run on 1.12 talents and who knows what other changes. Also the server you are playing on constantly is seeking old vanilla data and from time to time something new gets discovered and raids get altered. If I recall correctly last big thing was some boss armor changes.
---
Under 10 minutes? Can’t agree with this at all considering the king fight can take 5+ minutes by itself. Plus running there and back?
---
For Warlocks general rule of thumb is that Affliction is less gear dependent than Destruction but doesn't scale as well. So you'd start off with a heavy Affliction build and transition to a Destruction build over time. Both are very viable though depending on the circumstance. Affliction probably being better in larger fights, and Destruction being better in more focused engagements and 1v1s.
---
No idea on the Shaman question for PvE, I really only ever played Resto lol
---
If like they said they have the code and database of 1.12 they should know. (From what they said they don't have values from previous version tho).
---
Proof?
---
Trying to be a smart ass and you can't even form a proper sentence... lmfao
---
What was the word she was actually looking for?
---
Been a while since I've seen this episode.
---
&gt; paladins can cleanse fear.
---
&gt; so can priests.
---
Only if it's a magical effect fear. Most bosse's fears are physical effects.
---
There was always one dumbass Tauren hopping around.
---
Practice on K3
---
9:35, considering it's no.st but its a shit geared hunter so it's correct roughly. he despawnns the caster but not doing so should not take away a lot of time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwC0MQ07Quc
---
Do you remember my hunter Akkuma? :)
---
And im here to laugh at you laughing at me for no reason :)
---
Does this work for spells as well? Like heal yourself and then insta hs?
---
...Then the baby was born...
---
Warriors are the gods of late game. But we are talking about late late late game. Rogues will just choose not to fight and annoy other classes (not fully geared mages and SL warlocks tho)
---
gonna top the dps meters with my str-only, no pet melee survival hunter 😎
---
"Total trash" where?  A lot of those specs that are "total trash" in one area are "borderline overpowered" in another.
---
I'd hate to see those specializations become "incredibly overpowered" in the other area just to make them "viable" in the part of the game you're looking at, for them to lose their identity by having those other traits nerfed to the ground in order to become "competent DPS".
---
*Posts asking for advice on race*
---
*Proceeds to make nonsense arguments in response to a joke* (WotF is useless because PVP trinket, rofl)
---
*Knows more about Classic than anyone else because they play on pserver*
---
Why even ask for input if you already know everything based on pserver experience (which will probably end up different in Classic)?
---
Delicious.
---
On the server I'm playing on, I've found that at early levels it is absolutely amazing for DPS in dungeons, if you have Clearcasting.
---
Nice, here's your complementary Nightfall.
---
There was 0 influence from Activision.  They still operated 100% separately and didn't change anything in development.  It was building in that direction the entire time even from when they were under Vivendi, Activision was just the next step in gaining more control over the product.
---
WoW was such a success it really changed the game a lot, and the huge influx of players majorly effected the direction of the game.  TBC was almost a direct response to all of the vanilla criticism .
---
Auto-shot.
---
The sound of the bow.
---
Thanks, never thought about that use but I will make sure to do it myself.
---
The July 16th date will hold up.  This isn't the first time they've telegraphed a go-live date.  
---
I'm not so worried about a beta personally.  This is a different kind of product, and while I can't speak technically on why or why not it is necessary, it just doesn't feel to me like it is.  Stress tests seem more important to me.  
---
Either way, I firmly believe in the July 16th release date, and proudly wear a tin foil hat.
---
This.  It gets forgotten, but WoW was at the forefront of doing something different, listening and reacting to their player base.  You can argue if this was for better or for worse, but their dialogue with the fans has always been an important one.
---
Tranquility
---
I'd say rogues, hunters and shamans are the hardest to play 100% perfectly.
---
Before the QQ starts:
---
I'm not saying that these classes are OP or nerfed, I'm just stating the mechanical difficuly of mastering those classes.
---
It's doesn't mean that a terribad couldn't win playing those classes, specially if he plays a BM hunter for instance.
---
You are a blessing, friend.
---
The old "hand-farmed gold" sales pitch.
---
i knowww but migrating to SSD with a new OS would speed up my boot a lot so i might as well
---
This is pretty much the go to spec for raiding though, on my previous server which I cannot name or this comment will get removed, everyone used it. It's not just for AP, you also get 3% more dmg and crit 15% continued extra Mana Reg, 10% more mana and PoM.
---
The unconventional build they’re talking about is 3 points into imp cleave and 2 into battle shout as fury instead of all 5 in battle shout. Not the 5 man only specs.
---
WoD was unplayable at release on my server too, but people forget that it was also due to a massive DDoS attack.
---
POM+PYRO blast. Trying to down somebody 100-0 in less than 8 seconds. Cause there was no way I was surviving more than 9
---
They’re easily extractable from the 1.12 client but aren’t high res at all. Some of them are from the original concept art though - and you can find that original concept art (in quite high res) on scrollsoflore.com gallery :)
---
You are saying X on the one hand and Y on the other. Your own posts show that the actual numbers elude us all... You literally cannot make these claims without the numbers you do not have.
---
* If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is **less than or equal to 10** then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: **5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)\*.1%**
---
* If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is **greater than 10**, then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: **6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)\*.4%**  
---
According to the wiki this is weapon skill formulas vs defense.  
---
Boss mobs are 3 levels above you at 63. It's 5 defense or 5 weapon skill per level 5\*60= 300  5\*63=315.  
---
So if you a human with 305 weapon skill you have a 6% chance to miss a level 63 mob.   
---
5% + (315-305)\*0.1%= 6%  
---
If you have 300 weapon skill you have a 8% chance to miss a level 63 mob.  
---
6%+(315-300-10)\*0.4=8%  
---
Dual wield has an innate miss chance of 24%. When fighting a level 63 mob this increases 1% per level to a total of 27%.  This is for your white attacks not your yellow attacks.  
---
So to answer your question how much hit % does one gain from having 305 weapon skill ? 2 %
---
porn is the act. A single picture of sex robot doing nothing shouldn't be nsfw tho
---
Princess healing gloves were super strong, plus the boots she dropped were solid for both rogues and hunters.
---
Emperor dropped a nice neck for melee DPS, an awesome healing staff, a nice rogue/Hunter PvP cloak, rogue bracers, a really sick Hunter belt, nice PvP caster robes, and a solid healing off hand. That's before counting Ironfoe and HoJ.
---
Tons of good loot off Emperor/princess for basically everyone. A little caster light, but healers and all physical DPS will want some stuff off Emperor.
---
I leveled as DW all the way on a pserver semi-recently. It wasn't bad at all and I definitely chewed through green leveled mobs faster, but it was more fun and enjoyable which made dw worth it to me.
---
No guild banks. Ever.
---
Challenge accepted. maybe...
---
Ahhh thank you very much. Appreciate that.
---
I believe they said they have all the database information, which is different from having working code.  It’s part of “Dev’s Water cooler” post.
---
Well i cant give you solid proof, but Athene was banned for doing something like this. He was tagging mobs inside instance and getting world first in WotLK.  World first in TBC did it with outdoor mobs, and that was ok.  
---
They nerfed mob tagging as early as in TBC. So we definitely know they do not like it.   
---
But what they think about it now in Classic, i would like a blue post or more info about.
---
U don't DS for pvp, pet are way too precious
---
This guy thinks bubble hearth wasn’t a thing in vanilla.
---
99% sure the Kazzak abuse wont be in classic
---
To the 4th point.. what balance patches? The game is launching at 1.12, there are no valance patches to be had unless they decide to do things much later down the line. Also we know the itemization. Its 1.12.
---
NO MORE!
---
Probably Mage honestly. If you play Mage perfectly you almost never lose. 
---
Hunter I would say has one of the widest skill gaps in the game, with probably the lowest floor and one of the higher ceilings.
---
This is my plan. A casual guild where people can play what they want.
---
&gt;Organize with other players and discuss how we are going to solve this problem
---
This will not happen, you won't be sitting around taking turns picking up an item, fastest person wins and fucks off.
---
&gt;So lets theory craft a day one with sharding. I load in the world is manageable. I begin doing all of my quests solo. Why? because it's possible to and I want to go fast. I periodically group with other people for one or two crowded quests before we drop and, go our separate ways. Other then the slow speed of leveling. This is how you retail and, no one likes it.
---
So would you be okay with deleting all servers and wrapping up classic after 5-6 months? Because even with sharding, you will see more players in the first month than you will at any point after that.
---
&gt;Now lets take out sharding. I zone in to Durotar, look around and see 9000 other people. Whats my first move?... Make a group of course, no way I can solo this that would be impossible. What does that group do? They plan about how to try to solve this problem (they cant lol.) but they try though and, during the struggle. They make friends having a blast trying to tag mobs from other groups competing to get anything. Pretty soon rivalries rise and alliances form. This is magic. This is a spell being cast on the user. After that happens. Game play is put in it's proper place as secondary to social connections.
---
This is a delusion. Nothing you do 1-20 matters. I don't know where you played but I've never heard of anyone forming friendships and rivalries for life in fucking Durotar, it will be a zerg to get mobs and fuck over other players to the best of your ability like it was at every launch in history. This is ignoring the fact that 99% of the people you meet in the starting zone will quit before level 20.
---
99% of people you met when leveling were just that.
---
Lost how
---
The best Hemorrhage weapon in the game and one of the highest DPS is Displaced Servo Arm which is a random drop from naxx Trash.  It has approx. 60 DPS and is a 2.8 speed mace.  Can also go Combat Maces for PvP with it.
---
Saying "get ready for a classic summer" isnt clearly stating a summer release date
---
They will announce it when its ready
---
Would you rather get a release date, take off work, then have it get delayed?
---
I've been documenting what quests I did vs avoided, and what regions i spent my levels in. Trying to build a loose leveling guide for myself so when classic retail launches I can hit the ground running.
---
i'd say a hunter. on a basis that you can always see a drastic difference in what skilled hunter can do and unskilled, and super skilled. its like the most vivid among all classes.
---
there is a ton of nuance to the class, positioning is super important and playing with range, and prediction. things you can do with various pets etc.
---
destro warlock is also, not sl warlock, which just tanking and doting, but destro bursty one with succubus setting up bursts and controling people. you barely see a good one, ppl usually just suck. but when you see, oh boi. you need a good gear though.
---
Gl with broken tooth running at you fella
---
Time gating* arbitrary limits like that have been the bane of retail for a couple of years now
---
Yes, it will be hard for many here to understand that Agility is better for dps than Str.
---
It will warp the minds of many a Classic player who reads guides but never actually tests anything themselves.
---
Leveling Feral is easy. Stack A CRAP TON of Agility and Str. Prioritize Agility including enchants. Rarely use bleeds, they are a dps loss.
---
Learn to powershift. Learn to macro properly. Hotkey your shit.
---
Everyone who things Str is the top dps stat for cat needs to relearn the game. I've left a leveling guild over idiots arguing and insulting me over which stat is best, even though I tested each stat, leveled using Str as priority and Agility as priority, I've raided with STr as priority and Agility as priority. 
---
JUST GODDAMN STACK AGILITY!
---
We-aint-got-no-liiiiives
---
Not just PVP, it's one of the strongest raiding specs as well.
---
The damage is mid-high level and the utility is insane. Shadow Weaving and Vampiric Embrace are two of the strongest raid buffs that exist.
---
Troll is what I want if I'm gonna roll Horde, problem there is that I also like to pvp, and well, trolls aren't exactly even holding a candle compared to our god and savior Hardiness. Dat Hardiness is just too good to pass up.
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
That's interesting
---
Totally forgot about DM buffs, good catch. Just throwing it out there that we did go hard for progress since it seems like the theme is that we didn't use consumes back then and we just beat our head against an encounter until it was killed.
---
We'll see what happens when classic comes out as far as how accurate the pservers are, either way it'll be fun.
---
Not giving a release date makes launch issues less likely
---
The demo was an alpha version of Classic, but it was still a demo. It was a showing of what they had available at a time, but limited in a certain area of the game... which is pretty consistent for demos in general.
---
The mod scene
---
In Vanilla it should be impossible 99% of the time for a warrior to beat a rogue in 1v1.  Rogues have too many tools, can 5-8 kite, can reset fights easily.  If the warrior is Arms or Fury, the rogue should almost never lose.  Especially if Undead for WoTF.
---
Fury Warriors the best DPS spec when it comes to raiding, but yes dual wielding while leveling is a shitty idea.
---
I didn't say that wotf was useless just not as good as EA hardiness and SF
---
There’s always going to be people buying gold. It’s not really pay to win, more like pay to save time farming (for consumables, engineering stuff, etc.)
---
I know it’s a minor distinction, but it’s still better than those shitty new age mmos where you literally can’t compete unless you buy some in-game stuff. 
---
I personally won’t buy gold, and I’m not worried at all about gold buyers. In my eyes they’re just losers, but that’s just me.
---
It also doesn't mean that when I refuse to invite you to my group you can call me an elitist asshole. People don't seem to get it, i'm not telling you to play a ret or enhance but you're also not entitled to have me tank for you!
---
So considering I actually hate transmogs, I'm super pumped for the mismatch. Feels more like a real game without heirlooms and transmog.
---
Boring. But very very easy.
---
SO mages can get away with high burst, survivability, CC, and they have mobility... what gives warlocks should be able to soak and do more damage at least burst wise.
---
you mean the pet that I can run away from and it'll eventually despawn? And then come back and be out of range because I can outrange hunters? Ok.
---
Anyone on this thread who is arguing a priest can take out a hunter 1v1 is correct but they're also missing the point: Smite sniping is about building gaudy kill ratios by behind a wall of people far away enough so that nobody can target you.
---
Is WOTF really THAT good on rogue? o.O
---
And it'll take 12 hours to clear if you bring a single ret pala
---
I agree, I like my visual representation to be of the gear I have equipped.
---
It’s obviously not going to be released in summer homie
---
I'm saying the only unknown are the exact boss armor value and resistance. Even when those value are buffed beyond the estimated vanilla value (which is a disadvantage) the dps is still this high. You are delusional if you think people won't achieve what they can achieve on pserver with all their absolute min maxing and buff stacking.
---
It was peanut butter jelly time.
---
Salty your not an actual vanilla player.....this has to be hands down one of the gayest things I have ever read on this forum.
---
Nax will be cleared first day it's out almost guaranteed. Just watch
---
"Also the fight was bugged and tentacles spawned inside walls and stuff."
---
Then it's not a math problem as claimed by these thread.
---
Ice barbed spear wants to know your location.
---
&gt; Did your W2 not work on Win 10? It seems that what they call Classic is basically an unmodified W2: BNE and should work on Win 10 with this note:
---
I havent tried, but I remember it working on the same machine when I ran Win7. I might give it a try sometime. 
---
But I have long since lost the disk, so I'm just using the key and downloading a disk image.
---
Because a lot of us will be racing at launch and a lot of us will be taking weeks off, not days so if the first day is a clusteffuck of broken servers it doesn't matter.
---
Damn Pallys! I never had that hat cuz there was always a retradin needing it and rolling more than me :'( (I was a righteous Priest healer).
---
After I got it I busted myself all the way down to private(Zim) with DKs to make room for other people.
---
You seem disinterested in facts so I will leave you with your opinion.
---
Its interesting, since in vanilla you pretty much rotate dwarf/gnome zones with human zones anyway
---
A demon or an undead. Might be able to stretch the definition for the undead since prior to it being undead it was a living boar at least in lore. But the demon? Sorry, not gonna accept parallel evolution as an indication of it being a boar. Would be dumber than calling a porpoise a fish. After all, both are streamlined and swim in the ocean. They're both fishes, right? No they are not. But I understand why you need the cheat since otherwise, there's a level gap too large to bridge. Honestly, calling those demons "boars" is dumber than calling koalas, "koala bears".
---
first of all
---
&gt;  in major social hubs 
---
social hubs are naturally lower in performance requirements for the server than a congested pvp, world boss, or  combat zones in general. 
---
second, queuing and sharding exist to solve problems (slightly different problems, but related ones). in the cases of moonguard,  the backlash for solving the issue is probably worse than just letting what happens happen. In these cases, blizzard is choosing to ignore the problem (which some people think they should do for classic). They may have even allocated more server resources to these specific cases. not sure, im not familiar with the specific differences of RP servers vs non-RP for wow since I've never played on one.  
---
ultimately, Blizzard is attempting to keep servers from crashing at launch for classic. This is solved two ways  
---
the queue: this exists to establish a worst case scenario. i.e worst case is 3k players in a single area.  
---
sharding: reduce congestion of known bottleneck areas, i.e starting zones.  
---
server tech has also gotten significantly better. We don't know how bad it will be and what queues will be required, but a queue WILL be required. My point is more that the reasons for having sharding is not to reduce queue times, that would be having a solution to a problem cause by a solution to a problem. you could just not have a queue, but in doing so they would be ignoring the problem and basically be asking for their servers to crash.   
---
Sharding exists to reduce congestion, client lag, and respawn times in a particular area. Queues exist to solve these issues on a global scale by establishing a worst-case scenario. Having strict sharding makes queues less necessary and vice-versa, but sharding doesn't exist to reduce queue times
---
Ask Joe Rogan.
---
Wow.. never knew this existed.
---
Amazing there are still things about Vanilla I don't know
---
Honestly I hope they will eventually at least go up to WOTLK. I feel like they could launch legacy servers for new expansions every few years and not only get people that loved those expansions but also get revenue from individuals who want to transfer their heroes from xpac to xpac.
---
Engineer Tauren Shaman cause utility is life
---
&gt; The UD racial is the same as the pvp trinket so it's kinda useless 
---
Rofl. Okay though. I'm done.
---
Huh? Warlock and hunter are way more difficult. 
---
Shadow priests are one of the easiest classes to pvp as. Pretty much faceroll.
---
The way the talent trees were setup was confusing. Vanilla had way more obscure things in regards to potions/items/etc. that you could stack. There wasn't a lot of info you could pull from the forums back in those times either.
---
Playing a Priest healer I learned about things like downranking from others. I had mods that would tell me what my HPM (health per mana) was for my heals so I on my own had to figure out which heals I wanted to put on my bar. Something like Heal Rank 3 was considered the most efficient heal for a Priest for single target healing.
---
Being a good healer back then was being the most mana efficient. We used to have heal meters and the healer that did the least overhealing vs healing ratio was considered a good healer.
---
Comparing this to BC and WOTLK (I quit at Cata)... yeah. BIG difference. Whole dedicated tutorials, videos, etc. in regards to how to min-max your class to the max.
---
I would like the old graphics in terms of characters, but I’d like the new water shaders, but that’s just my opinion!
---
Well, I don’t. I LOVE IT ❤️
---
If you're a fury warrior or a rogue, hit rating trumps all. Period. Even if you hit the softcap, you still benefit from hit rating. That 9% you need is for yellow numbers only. Your auto attacks still benefit from more hit.
---
Just reset pet and you're back to spending all your time running away, sounds like a fun day for you tbh.
---
I used to do...
---
 /yell [Orcish] yorn desh born der ritt der rue
---
And tell the people who whispered me asking how I was speaking orcish that you could learn it from a book in the library of orgimar, and many of them later whispered me that they cant find the library and they keep getting killed
---
This guy.
---
You think Vanilla wasn't time gated? AQ and Naxx were gated and so was most other conent with gear/rep farm.
---
This was the first epic I ever saw in Vanilla and somebody actually stole it from the 5 man. I complained to them and they actually gave it to me.
---
The difference DPS wise is so minor, play the race you want man.
---
Supposedly Fishing Up the Ashbringer, but you had to have some insane fishing skill to do it.  Also some kinda of horde-alliance/alliance-horde translator, but you had to have some insane engineering skill to do it...
---
What is there to camp? IIRC the traitor doesnt flag you for pvp does he? Or you just going to kill repeatedly to grief?
---
Where's the plate bikini, bruh?
---
Recklessness. I don't even play a warrior but you know when they pop that shit you'll die 9/10 times lol
---
Do a full pally group. Paladin tanks, paladin healers, paladin dps. That would be impressive.
---
Wow could you generalize any more?
---
&gt; For years everyone crying for an official vanilla release
---
Everyone crying for a Vanilla release has their own reasons for wanting Vanilla and their own plans/goals etc. People are different, you lumping the entirety of the community who wants Classic into the next few things you say is so incredibly naive and ignorant I think you might just be trolling.
---
&gt;has been complaining about how everyone just rushes to level cap ASAP in the current retail version and doesn't bother enjoying the journey
---
You think the entire classic community that's been pushing for classic cares that people rush to the level cap in retail? Do you actually believe this?
---
&gt;and now that Classic is coming out, all these people are planning to waste their vacation time bidding nolifing the game to reach level cap in a couple weeks?
---
Entirely different group of people. Why would people whining about slowing down and enjoying the game rush to 60 in Classic? They wouldn't, they different people. I myself am rushing to 60 in classic and I don't give a shit what people do in retail.
---
I hope they don't do that.
---
We all heard the Ashbringer rumors.. we all knew it was just an urban legend.. I'm not gonna... hey..did that Oozling look at me funny..? It does have a suspicious walking pattern... should probably kill it..
---
**&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for heals, off tanks, and locks.
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---

Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
If it did, people would've just mounted up, no?
---
Concussive shot, right as you see someone trying to close distance to you.
---
You can almost smell the rage, sometimes they even just stop playing and wait for you to kill them.
---
Unless questing in hellfire
---
b-b-b-but OP totally watched some youtube video and knows the numbers!
---
But they did claim (afterwards) that they were surprised at how many issues the community found that they were unaware of.
---
That would assume the hunter also has equivalent gear. Pvp hunters have an ass ton of health too. 
---
Good hunters wreck warlocks. The ONLY issue is that there are not many great hunters. It's the highest skill cap class in game for pvp ... PERIOD.
---
Nearly every player who talks about hunters in pvp, don't play hunters, and sure as shit haven't mastered pvp with them. 
---
Yes it's true that a bad hunters will make it appear they aren't as effective, but this is only a narrow perspective. Average warlock players will do "OK" in pvp. Average hunters get destroyed in pvp. You have to be great, and woe to even good warlocks against a great hunter.
---
Nah achievements are cool honestly  you hardline vanilla fanatics are insane sometimes. Literally effects nothing.
---
Only problem I can see is the link certain raid achives becoming standard and I really dont want to see that happen.  It's like fresh out of college job postings that require 3 years in field exp. How do I get that if I cant get base level jobs lol
---
Very unpopular opinion. RELEASE IT TOMORROW BLIZZARD! :D
---
Yeah, this was pre-nerf AV, so it was mostly to break through the Stormpike Bridge. People didn’t know about the back door, so the only way in was by busting through the gates. Most of my time in AV was tanking bosses, and using Intimidating Shout to cap graveyards.
---
he'd probably know
---
If you were topping the meters as Shadow Priest then everyone else in the raid must have really fucking sucked.
---
I've had to tab out and look at Druid skills, see if it's worth it to port to Moonglade or not. This information will be very useful, thank you.
---
I thought you could kite indefinitely until people started dragging outdoor raid bosses to towns. I saw this happen a few times in Vanilla.
---
He looks strong hahahahh
---
And that antenna hgahha
---
Du burde kigge her [/r/klassiskwow/](https://reddit.com/r/klassiskwow/) :)
---
They already confirmed it's comming out at summer.
---
So it's as late as september, not december.
---
I switched at level 48 when I got thrash blade and never looked back.
---
Muh eyes!
---
My video was leeroy jenkins.
---
Hunters have quite a high skill ceiling when it comes to 5 mans, it's all about pet control and maximizing DPS while keeping your CCs and debuffs up.
---
In raids they are kinda meh, but still a boon or a must on certain bosses.
---
Post AQ40 gear as a rogue you NEED WoTF to actually beat a competant warlock, and by Competant I mean like gladiator-Rank 1 tier.  It also gave 20 seconds, then 4 seconds of fear immunity post nerf.  A warrior's big chance of beating a rogue is fearing them into an intercept charge and globalling them with crits in the 3 second stun.
---
This. Good flag-running requires you to master the differences between cat-form, healing, and travel-form and to some extent bear form (for the armor buff). Normally travel-form isn't really a different "form" but I think it's important to think of it as one in WSG due to dash and feline swiftness in cat-form, the inability to use travel-form indoors, the inability to heal in travel form, not benefiting from the armor of bear-form. So you've gotta have your gameplan figured out pretty well which includes knowing when to be in travel form. 
---
So you've got your 30% faster move speed of unstealthed cat form, 100% faster with dash, your regular move speed of your casting/healing form, your regular move speed but with increased armor in bear form, your 40% faster move speed of travel form, and stealth all to utilize at opportune moments. 
---
You've got to figure out your routes. It's been years since I've played WoW, but if I recall, there's three ways into the flag room, and two ways out. Each has their advantages and disadvantages, and which route is preferred is based partly on where your allies are. Normally you want to get outside as soon as possible, but if your team has secured the tunnel, go that way. 
---
Then you've got your mana supply which is required for shapeshifting and healing (and MAYBE once in a blue moon using moonfire if an enemy is super low health, or using entangling roots, but typically you're relying on natures grasp procs to root). Throwing on a rejuve and swapping back to travel form is easy enough, but occasionally you'll need to do more than that, tossing on a regrowth as well, so discovering the correct opportunities to do that is clutch. 
---
While in the main part of the battlefield, there's two main strategies to follow: 
---
1. Run towards your teammates.
---
2. Run away from the enemy.
---
This sounds simple, but in a battleground the correct choice here shifts every moment as team mates and enemies kill eachother, move, and respawn. So while you normally will want to run along the edges of the battlefield, you'll occasionally want to just dive through the middle where your allies are waiting to protect you.
---
You'll of course also want to plan your flag routes with an idea of which powerups are up and how you'll use them. 
---
Lastly, while most of the time you'll be focussed on yourself, what separates a good flag runner from a great flag runner is awareness of the battlefield. You'll occasionally need to get your hands dirty and help out a team mate. Alternatively, if you've got teammates running with you, you're not doing anyone any favors by not communicating and failing to work in tandem with them. 
---
I could go on longer here, but the point is flag-running is an art, and one that in the end only a druid can truly master.
---
Why do you think July 12th? July 12th is a Friday, they don't release games especially a version of wow on a Friday.
---
Lmao this isn't evidence in any way, shape or form. The actual vanilla experience deviated greatly (Not 1.12 itemization or talents), pserver scripting may be way off for tentacles. Also your graph includes burn phase which bumps the DPS way up.
---
1/10 "informative mathimatical" post
---
You more or less can not raid as ele at all, because of the massive mana issues.
---
What the hell version of Classic did you play? lol
---
**&lt;The Dad Zone&gt; \[Alliance\] \[PVP-NA\]**  Casual Raiding &amp; PVP Guild | **2 Weekly Raids @ 8:30 ET**
---
**Concept:** Times have changed and a lot of us have significantly less time to play than we once did. This guild is going to be focused on giving those individuals a chance to raid when they are available and still have a chance to clear the difficult content that Vanilla has to offer.
---
**Loot Rules:** We are creating our own set of raid loot rules that reward people for their commitment while still allowing casual players and drop-ins a chance at some loot. This system will be a modified luck roll. For each raid boss that is defeated we will be awarding a certain amount of "Luck" to every player present. This luck will be added to a /roll on needed gear. When you win an item luck will be subtracted from your total. This means even a casual raider on their first adventure will have a chance to roll a lucky 90 and get some sweet loot!
---
**Rules:** 
---
* 21+ only. (Dad status not required)
---
* Have fun - It's going to be slower gearing and slower progression. If that's not something you will be happy with than I'd look for a guild more to your liking
---
* Bring your "A" game for raids - We want to be a casual fun atmosphere, but because we only have a small window to raid, when the fights start we focus up and get shit done. In other words don't get **too** drunk...
---
**Other Stuff:** We are setting up a discord for most of our guild communications and voice chat. It is still under construction and we are still working on a bot to help facilitate our unique roll/loot system. We are open for people taking leadership roles including raid leaders and specialization leaders (DPS, Tank, Healer). 
---
Send me a PM if you're interested!
---
yes exactly.
---
PoM pyro crits will always have a place in my heart.
---
I was a GM during vanilla WoW, and was roommates with another GM.  I didn't realize it when it happened, but he became notorious on the WoW forums for answering the question, "What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object" To which he replied "Chuck Norris Dies" - when I found out months later it was him by glancing at the GM name on the screen shot, it would be me who would die.  Still cracks me up to this day.
---
A friend who I had started a guild with on a fresh server was the first rank 14 on our server.  Our guild was also notorious on the WoW forums on our servers page for being absolutely a-hole World PvPers, with him being the main culprit.  The day he hit rank 14 all Chuck Norris jokes in the Barrens were replaced with his game name, and the server WoW forum was flooded with people trolling the alliance.  We got a kick out of it.
---
I probably shouldn't share this one, but good times.  Once as a GM I received a ticket about a guy being Mind Controlled into the lava in Black Rock Mountain.  It was very broken English and had very inconsistent syntax and capitalization through out, it was also a wall of text.  I forwarded it to a buddy on my team and he came up with a voice and tone inflections for the entire thing and I can still to this day say it word for word with the voice, lol.  On the one hand I feel like a dick for making fun of the English, but on the other hand I like to think I am making fun of the fact he got mind controlled into the lava and was freaking out about it, lol.
---
Why do people include September? How do you define summer - by how warm it is? I always thought the seasons were clear-cut as a kid - December, January, February - winter; March, April, May - spring; June, July, August - summer; September, October, November - fall/autumn.
---
If we go by climate or the exact tilt of earth's axis, then the dates would be all over the place every year. I think for simplicity's sake, it's best to go by the months of the almost universally accepted and followed Gregorian Calendar.

Similarly, I hate the American/English categorization of the time of day. You have morning, afternoon, evening, and night - seems like a perfectly easy task to divide it into 4 equally long time frames, but no, lets take "morning" (the time of day most people seem to hate) and make it HALF of the 24 hour period. I mean, what is running through people's heads when they utter the grossly ridiculous term of "1 o'clock in the morning". Oh shit, is it MORNING already? Better get up and start your day AT 1 AM AT FECKING NIGHT!
---
No. To me, afternoon is from 12pm to 5:59pm, evening is from 6pm to 11:59pm, night is from 12am to 5:59am and morning is 6:00am to 11:59am. You can bend the rules a LITTLE and call 5am morning or 5pm evening, but don't go calling 3am morning - to me, that's as ridiculous as calling 11am "afternoon" (really? did you happen to notice the word "afternoon" explicitly states it's AFTER noon, i.e. after 12pm?).
---
Sorry. I must be going through something right now - there's no way I would be that upset about this...
---
/rant over
---
I have a vague memory of these items being used to one-shot a SoO boss (Shamans maybe) in MoP. They would proc off each other and delete the boss in a flurry/chain of extra swings, it was pretty cool!
---
Yep. Just look at how many times Walmart opens up more checkouts for long lines.
---
EM CL
---
If you think thunderfury is going to the rogue, unless that rogue is either guild leader or officer, you are dreaming...
---
I hated trying to get a group at lvl 20 to get my pally hammer.  Alliance never wanted to walk to SFK
---
They clearly missed a word, yet you feel the need to be a dick. Good on you...
---
Haha, great stories!   That was awesome.

What if my hunter alt doesn’t even have BiS?
---
well i live in florida and can go to the beach year round. gimmi this game ASAP.
---
Yes. In OW last night in QP we were all having fun, and the Tank started to get very angry at us all for not following their plans. Then just said "I will NOT tank if you all continue to Fortnight up this shit". 
---
Very angry tank, and they switched. 
---
We won, just having fun. But boy oh boy that Tank was not happy.
---
Death by acronym
---
They said at blizzcon 2018 that WoW Classic is Coming Summer 2019. Not Stress test is coming summer 2019 lol.
---
The VC glitch existed in classic though, so leaving it in is authentic.
---
At no point has phasing been in the conversation. Phasing was used in very limited in the AQ opening event and the Shattered Sun patch in TBC. It wasn't until WotLK that phasing was used to start pushing more narrative driven zones. You're thinking of sharding.
---
I realize I'm being a bit pedantic here, but it's important that we're all talking about the same thing, and phasing and sharding are two completely different mechanics.
---
they literally said that Classic will be released Summer 2019. Thats how you're lost.
---
Sounds familiar, were you a night elf?
---
Pallies didn't have a taunt in classic though did they?  I don't see how they could tank anything unless they majorly out-geared the content they were tanking.
---
We know who doesn't pvp.
---
On my rogues I always got major satisfaction from every 5 point Cold Blood Eviscerate.
---
You're just showing your lack of knowledge.
---
Zones aren't "near empty" on pserver launches and 6-7 is quite average time on those. 
---
Druids are one of the faster levelling classes and anybody including a warrior can get "ahead of the pack" with a plan and some skill. 
---
Get good
---
Je t’aime aussi &lt;3
---
Single highest skill cap for pvp is hunter.
---
This doesn't mean they are the best overall at pvp and especially in certain situations. 
---
You can play a hunter for a year solid, and still learn new tactics and ways to play. I'd place Druid high on the list due to the complexity of learning many dramatically different builds that need different gear sets. 
---
My favorite support class is Shaman as I find it the most engaging within groups and it's rare to see good shaman pvp support. Most can't seem to understand their role and proper use of totems.
---
I use to love warlock but I find the area denial strategy a bit boring these days. Sure they have tons of options, but at the end of the day you are just a non-mobile caster. The don't suffer from a dead zone and do not need to learn how to kite using a unique shooting mechanic.
---
When I transition from a hunter to a warlock (like on my last server), my immediate though was that the warlock was like a boring, easy mode version of a hunter. A hunter is more like a ranged rogue. Tricky, mobile, fun ... while trying to manage mechanics that most find annoying or won't admit that they never mastered.
---
Not so much an urban legend, but people used to tell lowbies in low level zones to type /pvp to “call the guards” when the other faction was invading.. good times.
---
With arcane power. Esp if you get a trinket, it's substantially better than a pve deep frost build.
---
Arcane was the most enjoyable thing ever in ICC.
---
As someone who was in highschool at the time it felt AMAZING being able to play cutting edge content as a DPS (I was a decent player, but if I had been playing a more complex class I wouldn't have performed as well) and nearly topping the meters because of how well they scaled.
---
Nevermind the fact that Arcane only required 11% hit instead of the regular 17% because of talents, 10% if you had a Draenei. You could just gear so easily and bosses melted from blast blast blast blast missile proc spam.
---
Not bringing consumables to raid is like showing up to the park to play basketball in flip-flops.
---
Relatable!
---
Oh shit that's true. Every trick in the book counts.
---
Bubble+hs
---
Even on a high pop private server I do remember the bad names and avoid them. 
---
I ran by one and they said "buff me" and I said "no...you know what you did". It was dumb to say but funny. They proceeded to use bad language.
---
When fights are 60-90 seconds long, arcane power is up for 10-25% of the fight...
---
Consider PMing me what server you're rolling on when they release the list. You will never see my smites coming, biotch.
---
So whats your point? Everything can be skeezed. If you are afraid of that, just make the entire leveling process hard enough to require a 5 man t3 group, keep quests uncompletable in a raid, and keep xp divided by members of the group. Now, even if you can kill stuff, youre getting 1/5 xp, killing super slow, or getting less xp and no quest rewards. If I make it hard enough to basically one shot something that isnt T3, it gets hard to outzerg it.
---
Or you simply add an item off KT that allows you acces to the portal--then make the content still as hard--so even if you get carried to the item, you'll not have a good time..
---
But still that isn't great design. There is no way to incentivize people to stay at 60 when 70 and another whole set of dungeons and raids is available. Because even with the above system, people wont farm T2 full till trying t3 then t3 full before leveling. They will keep clearing the raids, getting loot, then spending the rest of their time bashing their head into the new leveling content till they can get through it. 
---
The solution isnt making 60 content relevant in a later expansion, the solution was making Naxx era last longer so everyone who wanted to could experience it. Hardcore super nerds be damned--they will resub at xpo launch anyhow.
---
Agreed on all points -- my guild got Sapphiron down before TBC's pre-patch. The only fight we required consumables and world buffs was Loatheb, because the guild bank was making the shadow prot potions and frankly there was not enough herbs on the market during progression to sustain the bank coffers and supply needed during progression. 
---
As a guild officer, I would have mild panics when people would get separated coming from STV or spread out along the road in EPL. On the flip side, we have never rolled over the opposite faction raid groups camping the entrance harder. 
---
People in our group used consumables when they wanted to flex or if it was the end-wing boss, aside from the tanks, who the guild supplied.
---
Progression was determined entirely on consistency -- roster, execution, server stability (Thaddius -_- ). After a certain point, it was never about being undergeared/underbuffed, but about people doing their jobs and staying alive.
---
And everything on the same diminishing return.
---
OMG I know, so frustrating. You try to tell everybody to ride together in a Zerg past the RH into the graveyard...but people are like, “nah, let’s get AOEd to death on the bridge instead!!!”
---
Won't need to
---
Didn't they remove chain procs in a vanilla patch? It's been a golden rule for a long time and I remember my Halberd being nerfed. But it looks like that item was singled out in patch notes while the rest were less clearly documented.
---
Ice blocking when someone throws all their shit at you ^^
---
and your defending someone who was being an ass? What kinda dipshit juice you drinking?
---
I actually played on Earthen Ring during TBC and wrath. It was definitely a quieter realm and PvP was not as popular (it was an RP realm). Wonder if that helped him maintain his status.
---
I don't think they'll release  anything tomorrow because 8.2 will be on the PTR this week, and I doubt they'll want Classic to overshadow it. I also don't think there'll be a beta at all.
---
(Hopefully I'll be wrong and tomorrow we will get the release date tomorrow!)
---
12 warriors ?! The last one to join the raid must cry a little every (rare) time he gets a bit of loot !
---
That's not how it works but I respect the effort. If you stop participating you're not even considered in the pool. You don't "clog" or take a spot because of your rank.
---
&gt; Sure there might be some deviation but it shouldn't be that much.
---
considering most bosses in pservers have 0 all resists and people STILL dont know how much per lvl resist is its pretty safe to claim this is just isnt accurate at all. no one knows how much more or less damage people are doing on private servers compared to classic.
---
most people going for world 1st cthun agreed it was killable with bugfixes and most pserver top players claim it could be killed with original numbers, this however doesnt mean resistances and armor on bosses are accurate(theyre not.)
---
Holy shit that's hilarious
---
At least you can hide the helmet and cloak, and put on a tabard to salvage this godforsaken look.
---
Also reserves lots and lots of reserves. Happens in current classic realms. They need a couple people but it’s mostly guild? Reserve all the loot they want.
---
Well that’s the thing is I was participating. You think the people that helped you get GM aren’t expecting you to bring your shiny new Claymore to the party?
---
Nah
---
You should be able to duo sfk with another paladin at early lvl 20's, at least far enough to get the quest objective done.
---
The population actually stagnated and dropped before changes were made though.
---
If you are asking the question, it means you'll probably be fine. You will likely do some simple research on your class, spec, and the game. And having any experience in healing means you understand the basics of the role. 
---
As others said, always have plenty of water in your bags and mana potions if possible. That's probably the main beginner mistake. Other than that just know your spellbook, what heal and utility spells you have available.
---
That's high quality journalism we have right there : his source is basically forums and he couldn't bother to try to reach the guy more than once !
---
Heh, couldn't be further from the truth honestly.
---
Might not be classic relevant, but truly a classic video nonetheless!
---
Literally just play it and find out....
---
If you dont like it try a different class.
---
I think you could separate pvp into wsg, duelling and arathi basin. Most classes play very differently between these areas, and as a consequence the skill ceiling changes between them. Example rogue duelling vs rogue in wsg(defending flag &amp; killing efc if he crosses) I would say killing some1(usually druid or mage) trying to run away from you is easier than someone focused on killing you.
---
In an overall sense I would go with Hunter, not only because an average player would make his hunter seem bad, but because you could catogorize above average hunters into probably 3 or more tiers, opposed to most classes where above average and really good would be enough to describe them
---
I remember trying to find Nessy, the one you can see in the Deeprun Tram if you walk it. People always used to talk about where between SW and IF you’d have to go to find Nessy and build up the lore. I think I checked everywhere for that dang thing to no luck.
---
what a beautiful specimen
---
I plan to play spriest, show me that sweet specc and rotation in the future
---
They usually have a beta yes, but that's mainly to get player feedback on new, developed content, and any bugs that are there - while the content for Classic has already been through that. I suspect there'll be one or two bugs when Classic is launched, but they'll likely be minor and fixed swiftly.
---
You are almost correct.  Almost all PvP rogues take improved gouge which makes gouge last 4.5 seconds.  MOST of the time if you are playing well vs. the other class, you can get a restealth off, as it comes back up in .5 seconds.
---
Won’t you feel sad about missing out on the human areas 1-40? I’m really debating whether I want to enjoy those routes the first time or get that sweet kitty... tough choice!!
---
&gt; I really like healing, but i also like melee combat, 
---
Have you heard about our Lord and Savior Shaman Christ?
---
Fuck the meta, enhancement PVP all day.
---
**Toronto Players Wanted!**  
---
The purpose of this post is to find semi-no lifers in Toronto who are interested in creating a PvP server raiding guild.  Looking for experienced players who live in the GTA area and are over the age of 19.  
---
Community is the most important aspect of this game, and I feel like we can do better by introducing a real life aspect to that community.  What I'm pushing for is a group of like minded cool folks that wanna build a local raiding guild.  I'm thinking about hold LAN raid nights occasionally, and just generally fostering a stronger sense of community.    
---
So far I have a small group of 30-35 year old Toronto/Hamiltonians interested, and we're looking to expand.  We were all successful PvPers and raiders at one point, and looking to rekindle that glory and make new friends.
---
Soooo, if you and anyone you know are interested, please respond and let's see if we can get a 50+ GTA group going.  We can decide the guild direction a little closer to release, for now, just looking for Toronto based WoW nerds &lt;3
---
Let's get this conversation going!
---
You forgot about the warrior.
---
Hearth bubble out of everything :), makes the gankers rage a lot lolz.
---
cool story
---
I had that hat on so many chars :)
---
I tried this with the Baron Geddon explosion debuff on private servers, but never got the timing right.
---
you don't need to split them.
---
Not true, never forget StarCraft: Ghost
---
If the retail and classic sub are tied together, couldn't you just farm gold and buy tokens on your retail account?
---
We shall see, I'm happy to be wrong but people really seem to be putting those numbers low.
---
They are just way different to play in Vanilla.  Arcane shot is absolutely shit, it has 0 scaling in Vanilla so it's just a filler for like 1 shot.  Most damage comes from Autos, poison, Aimed Short, and multishot.  Multishot is really good single target even, in Vanilla. They are fine in all aspects of Vanilla and will be my second character.  Dwarf is better than Nelf for PvP by far as Stoneskin will help you break rogues from 5-8 kiting you.
---
my god, it's beautiful
---
There is a possibility of it being BIS for 2h fury tanks come classic. Since there are people claiming its reflect effect scales with the Flame Buffet debuff.
---
Im in the classic wow discord voice channel, if you want to talk and know more about it.
---
But it isnt classic then? Or many people will argue that
---
Thanks!  I really feel like WoW was just a great memory maker of a game.  It was a special time!
---
As a paladin, one simply doesn't oneshot people :o
---
I played on this realm during this time. Longarms the night elf hunter, it wasnt a high pop realm so he was taking the rank 14 spot almost hostage. I believe it was an older retired man. Just like the article says he wasn't the most skilled. He was in my Bgs many of times.
---
Oh it's a one time use item? The video fails to mention that. That makes it far less useful unless you're pretty hardcore.
---
Moonfire, often 5-6 of them in a row to get a killing blow.  Always entertaining to me.
---
Found the Salty kid from STV.
---
The Wow classic servers will have the nerfed WOTF so 8 seconds. So would you really trade Stone form or escape artist to beat mages for WOTF?
---
Picked whatever looks cool. Zero research in advance outside of what the character creation screen says. Still is my main in most expansions. So just pick what looks most interesting, dont worry about the meta. If you are fun, respectful, and reliable you'll have a spot in whatever you want to do.
---
For classic, I know all the classes now. Narrowed to 2 and then chose the one with the tier sets I like the best. The other will be my main alt. Pretty easy choice.
---
your post? that's for sure
---
A Cone of cold killing blow is always pretty cool
---
that isn't what a death threat is
---
If I was ganking a paladin and he bubble hearthed, then I clearly won and I would feel good.
---
Depends. If you don't mind doing less damage then as soon as you get weapons worth equipping.
---
Otherwise a decent rule of thumb is the following:
---
    (Mainhand weapon dps + (offhand weapon dps * 0.5 offhand reduction)) * (1.0 - 0.19 dual wield miss - 0.05 base miss)
---
Versus
---
    Twohand weapon dps * (1.0 - 0.05 base miss)
---
There are other factors involved such as talents, consistent resource generation, and ability-weapon interactions. Such as more attacks = more chance to flurry. But ultimately fury is a mediocre spec for leveling 40-60 due to mortal strike and sweeping strikes.
---
Like healing *and* melee combat? 
---
[See this handy comparison between two classes that might interest you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mD1n4v2JA)
---
Paladin is what you are looking for.  Best buffs, best defensive abilities and a pain to kill.  If you are horde then go for priest
---
will see how my shadow priest will work. no plan to respec for raid 🙈
---
Bro this isn't a debate. You are wrong. My statement about how people act without sharding unlike yours is not an opinion. It's history that has played out time and, time again across many servers. 
---
Secondly 6 months after release I expect classic will be more popular then retail for the social connections it forms. Retail is a parasite that thrives and lives on nostalgia. Once classic arrives retail is a niche game for hardcore neck beards who want to do Mythic 7 and Arena.
---
One of the mistaken reasons you think Retail will be more popular the classic. Is that you are mistaking people who don't have time. With people who are "casual" players. Retail only appeals to the hard core and the hard core hard pressed on time. I could never get my father into retail it's just too much for him. He's pumped for classic though. Why? Because the game is far more easy and accessible for an old man. The game also motivates people to ask him for help. Which is why he likes to play a priest. He doesn't always know what to do because he's so casual. So he loves the fact people want him to be around so he can fill the role.
---
At role that at it's most basic only asks that he be smart enough to spam rank one of a spell and, move out of the fire around his feet. People like my father are going to come streaming back into classic wow because of this and, people like me will come streaming back because all our friends want to play too. Other then Naxx and a few bosses in AQ. Classic was an adventure almost anyone could take a part in. That again was part of the magic,
---
Even if you were only a decent 5man tank or heals, people will need you for almost anything. For the sake of convenience, the functions of a paladin will always be in demand.
---
**Improved Aspect of the Hawk** 
---
1 point = 1% chance to proc 30% attack speed for 20secs.
---
2 point = 2% chance to proc 30% attack speed for 20secs.
---
3 point = 3% chance to proc 30% attack speed for 20secs.
---
4 point = 4% chance to proc 30% attack speed for 20secs.
---
5 point = 5% chance to proc 30% attack speed for 20secs.
---
Does anyone tested with only 1 point = 1% chance?
---
**Endurance Training**
---
1 point = Increases Pet HP by 3%
---
2 point = Increases Pet HP by 6%
---
3 point = Increases Pet HP by 9%
---
4 point = Increases Pet HP by 12%
---
5 point = Increases Pet HP by 15%
---
Is it worth 5 points at the Aspect for 5% 
---
or 
---
1 point Aspect for 1% and 4 points in pet hp for 12% ?
---
That’s a low blow to the 9-5 crowd
---
While I appreciate the effort put into this post, I think it has some flaws.  Namely, you're seemingly taking him saying that 3833 DPS is needed without any context and saying that your private server numbers disprove that.  In reality, he is saying that given ALL THE OTHER circumstances in the fight, maintaining 3833 DPS throughout is impossible.  You have no way of disproving this, because you weren't playing an un-nerfed version of C'Thun when your numbers were collected.  
---
C'Thun was released on January 23.  He was first downed April 25.  All of the reports of the first kill say that it took place "hours after Blizzard made additional adjustments to the fight".  Going through the patch notes, I have found these relevant changes to C'Thun:
---
Patch 1.10, March 28:  
---
* Removed the stacking acid from the Flesh Tentacles in the C'thun encounter.
---
* Digestive Acid now increases its effect over time during the C'thun encounter.
---
* Fixed a bug that could allow for the Digestive Acid debuff to be removed.
---
* Lowered the amount of knockback dealt by Giant Tentacles.
---
* Tentacles should no longer spawn on players who have just been knocked back by a previous tentacle.
---
Note, this was nearly a full month before the first kill.  The next patch, 1.10.1, has no changes to C'Thun's encounter.  The next patch, 1.10.2, was May 2, so a full week after C'Thun was downed.  Whatever changes were made on April 25 were not documented in a normal patch but clearly had a huge impact on the encounter.
---
No hard taunt. In 5 mans you could BoP someone if they pulled threat and buy yourself a few seconds to re-establish threat. Was possible for it to be ineffective though if there was someone else who had also overtaken the pally on threat.
---
Have you considered that maybe they wanted to PvP still?
---
I played a Paladin in Classic, which meant raiding+world PVP +BGs. Paladins dont have the utility to heal while also meleeing because their heal spells have cast times. They work best in a Duo where they support and keep that player from being kited (blessing of freedom).
---
Paladins had trouble GETTING into range because they didnt have any good speed ability. Mages would blink away, Hunters would kite and get away, Rogues would vanish or stun lock. Pvping as a Paladin was basically taking a bunch of hits, healing thru damage and trying to stay alive - a frustrating experience. 
---
Potent in their own ways, but not a lot of “fun” along the lines of melee/caster hybrid. There WAS a Shockadin build that worked best with two paladins where you stunned and then Judged your opponent for huge spike damage, but it was nothing compared to mages dmg or rogues stun-locking. You usually died a slow death.
---
Paladin seems to fit your description perfectly. Priests are very squishy, shamans are way more offense oriented, and druids dont really buff teammates as much as everyone else.
---
Paladins are extremely tanky and come with some of the best buffs in the entire game with freedom/bop.
---
Man. It's been like 6 years since I've played WoW as a whole and even longer since Vanilla lol.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/As8HAATPzQx9
---
Depending on what faction you want, NE is the easiest to level with because until you get Mind Flay you can spam star shards.
---
Other than that the rotation is pretty simple (like most vanilla ones). Keep SW:P up, Keep Vamp Embrace up, Spam MB on CD and Mindflay in-between CDs. Watch your threat because MB causes additional threat when cast and threat gen from tanks blows. In dungeons you're probably just going to dot/flay most trash mobs.
---
You’re behind the curve homie
---
From my experience, if you like pvp and your class can go orc, you pick orc. For ally, just play what you want. That 25% stun resist is really strong for PvP though.
---
Endless rage
---
That AND shadow.
---
Arcane is actually good btw, you'll be playing that most of MC
---
The realmlist should just be in your usual wow folder. Is this a vanilla wow private server you're trying?
---
Thank you! Saved.
---
I feel like people will be even more willing to try out the unconventional specs now that we actually know how to play the game. People would often die to the dumbest things in vanilla because people just didn't know mmos or how to really play them well. As long as you have someone that can hold aggro with a shield(or in bear form) and someone that can heal everyone without going out of mana before the end of the fight you can take anything, maybe a CC or 2 to make it more manageable.
---
I have, but i feel that i like paladin more
---
Full druid groups!!
---
tell this to the guys here foaming at the mouth for me wanting it as a rogue :p
---
A raiding guild on my server had this contest where whoever donated to them the most would get a carry and I believe 1k gold prize.
---
I teamed up with a friend and to my surprise we actually won. He got the carry, but my share of gold lasted through the rest of vanilla

#**WHO WE ARE**
---
   Our guild will primarily focus on being an efficient leveling guild until we have at least 25 level 60 players. Then we will transition into a PvP guild with a heavy focus on raiding for the sake of gearing up. If you have experience as a raid leader, we are currently recruiting for the position. 
---
   PvP was much more satisfying for my friends and I when we played back from Vanilla WoW to WoTLK. Our main goal will be to achieve PvP rank and have a well-known reputation on our server as one of the most powerful PvP squads within our realm. 
---
   Vanilla WoW was a long time ago, most of us haven't played since then or at all. A lot of people have continued playing on private servers and have made many guides. Our guild will heavily make use of leveling guides and best in slot guides which will be able to be found in the corresponding text channels.
---
   If you enjoy PvP, and want to smash some faces, Trade Chat is the right guild for you.
---
#**WHO WE'RE RECRUITING**
---
All players who are interested in PvP in Classic WoW. Players that have experience or interest in leadership roles will have many plenty of roles to fill once Classic WoW launches.

Hi, I am a current gladiator resto shaman on live and play both priest and paladin in ranking on vanilla servers so I'm also a pvp healing addict! I suggest paladin for what you are asking about, it sounds like exactly what you need. They are tanky, the best pvp healer, purely defensive with tons of buffs and they use them like its their job.  They also can cleanse viper sting and they never go oom. The only problem is that they have no offensive dispel and aren't versatile, they are purely defensive healers. I feel gimped going back to my priest after healing on paladin, but I am a sucker for that benediction staff...   shamans are a good option for you as well, and they're more  versatile than paladins given their damage  potential and offensive dispell. However they are not as tanky and oom faster. Druid is not a great pvp healer but they have a lot of utility and are great FCs in WSG. I wouldn't reccomend priest from what you are looking for.
---
One thing to consider is that the Ironfoe proc makes you speak Dwarwish for a while and if you have an addon that shouts out stuff like taunts, interrupts etc then they won't work that well.
---
Noooo I'm going to Europe for 6 weeks in early August. It has to be before then lol
---
In classic WoW you should be able to absolutely beat mages if you can gouge the blink.  This is a real skill matchup thing to say, but is entirely possible to gouge them a lot.  Essentially timing mage blink on the opener, you gouge as the blink animation starts, and they will be incapped at the new location and you can run at them.  This forces a block generally, and you reset and win after.
---
Have to agree about Stoneform being a wonderful racial. But for a hunter, that racial is pretty much PvP only. If you have to use Stoneform as a hunter in PvE, you're doing something wrong. And since 5 mans, and raids are mentioned by the OP, I assume that the OP is talking about PvE. And for PvE, the night elf is a better choice with the higher agility. So the best race for alliance is pretty simple depending upon your final goal. PvP = Dwarf. PvE = Night Elf.
---
Can't camp, no kill, lesser win.
---
its not a folder its a file in the World of Warcraft directory. 
---
if you don't see it, you probably have system files display turned off or soemthing like that. install total commander file manager. thats what i use at least.
---
It's easier to raid on Alliance and Naxx is mega hard. The gear you get is also super OP in pvp. Combine that with the fact that Pallys go god mode in it. You have a confluence that comes together. To make it so any one who even remotely cares about pvp. Either stops playing or re-rolls alliance.
---
Then you basically spend all your time queing face first into Allliance Naxx'd up premades. Not fun at all.
---
No prob! I edited it an added some more info as I was remembering so double-check that.
---
*forgets to replace totem so it pulls a patrolling trash pack and wipes the raid.*
---
PVp bEsT iN sLoT
---
Do you want to be OP and the best pvp healer? Go paladin :)
---
Can we download this list?
---
Cool?
---
Want to play paladin? That's a paddlin'
---
This is such a vanilla UI, no bindings, 4:3 aspect ratio and the only visible addon here is something that improves the look of your character icon.
---
Wrong sub
---
"Thank you". The Dothraki have no word for thank you, being how they are.
---
The nelf agility bonus is +9 agi, not something I would remotely take into consideration
---
I got done by this on my first Molten Core xD
---
Improved water damn that should be a mandatory talent. Healers go way beyond 10k mana so the 4k mana over 30 seconds is way too little.
---
I think they actually want to make the game better and without any increase in price. That's reasoned by the fact that they haven't given us a release date yet.
---
If they gave us one, they could have stopped working on it and made us belive this is all they could find of data etc.
---
If I was Blizzard, I'd make us belive in their work and build up the player base. Then, after we've all been spellbound for 3-5 years, they would add some ingame P2W bullshit.
---
But I'm fine with that, ish.. I can't expect them to do charity for more than 5 years. That's a great time frame for me!
---
And removes the useless gryphon art at the bottom to make room for something like DPS meter.
---
do you have a link possibly
---
And wasting them is like getting an oil change every time to gas up your car. I fully advocate bringing them, just use them wisely.
---
You just have to mash major healing pots and dark runes on cooldown. By Naxx you probably won't compete with the top but at least you'll buff the warlocks.
---
Wrath had tons of self buffs and stuff to manage...
---
Most guilds will have like 4-5 spots for the meme specs. Better to have a good ret paladin with Nightfall than a shitty mage who can't even make water.
---
&gt; (pre-raid of course.)
---
&gt; Quel'Serrar
---
I remember a rumour on my server/perhaps many servers that getting exalted with the wildhammer clan would make all gryphon rides free of charge. The only way to grind exalted with em was to kill trolls in hinterlands and turn in those feathers they dropped, took ages. And of course getting exalted didn't give anything at all, i'm sure there was some disappointed people there.
---
As soon as they announced the RMAH, I knew exactly what would happen to the loot. What a steaming pile of shit that game was/is.
---
going on the internet and telling lies is not cool
---
I loved playing my arcane mage in early classic. Having to spec into instant-cast arcane blast was painful, but presence of mind and evocation was awesome for leveling.
---
I heard about that too, and I didn't even own an account until Wrath.
---
I really couldn't care less if some random person on the internet thinks I'm lying.
---
Definitely the wrong thread
---

Why would you post that here....

not all of us were children back in 04 bruh. Same shit, different day.

I'd rather blizz drop it on us randomly one day It would keep everyone on an equal playing field.

Rogues couldn't use axes in Vanilla.

Well you need a token thunderfury rogue. Why would one class have more right to a BiS item than another class?
---
I’d love to play alliance for human facials but my friends all want horde so I’m going horde.
---
Game really tries to punish you for fighting enemies higher lvls than player so they added crushingblows/glancingblows and plummeting hit chance.
---
The 3% hit would refer to when fighting   3lvl higher NPC. When fighting NPC same level as you then weapon skill is much less useful.
---
blizzcon
---
They confirmed it at blizzcon.
---
you tryin to rub Benediction in my face brah?
---
&gt;That's the blizzard I love...  they don't make promises they can't uphold.  it's done when its done
---
And that Blizzard has been gone for many years, so yeah, you're living in the past.
---
And actually having the mob hit the hunter during PvE is not something I would remotely take into consideration either. So the issue is "A defensive racial that will never be used", or "higher agility". The higher agility does actually have an effect, even though it's a small one. But honestly, the closing words that moonsti uses at the end of each of his "Best Race for XXX" videos (where XXX is some class) pretty much sums up everything:
---
"In the end, your race won't make a huge difference. The fact is, the racials here won't impact your performance that much. If you're going for that "picture perfect setup", then I'd follow my advice. Otherwise, I'd play whatever the fuck you want."
---
No, they dont have a taunt. You have to hold threat, but once you have it, holy shield + consecrate normally does a good job of keeping it. I think a shitty geared prot pally could tank for a shitty geared grp, and a really strong geared pally could tank for most DPS.

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly
---
I didn't say not using or bringing consumables, I'm talking about the the ridiculous hyper consumable meta on pservers. You don't need world buffs to clear MC, Wasting massive amounts of consumables in MC is just a waste of gold, is not needed and I highly doubt the majority of guilds will go full consumables for MC.
---
Achievements had very little to do with that shift. Was far more likely the amount of queue able content which made solo life more realistic for getting things done.
---
Wrong sub, this is for official Blizzard vanilla, try /r/wowservers
---
Quest rep is one of the few accurate things pservers have. 
---
* Human racial 10% bonus to rep
---
* walk to teldrassil at level 3
---
* do ALL darnassus quests, including bfd and stonetalon mountains
---
* do ALL 500 faction quests, including the night watch and gnomer
---
* finish with morrowgrain if you decided to skip quests
---
Quests give 100% rep orange-green and decay every level past grey, so you must do them at current level for this to work.
---
*"Ladies please, there's plenty enough for me to go around."*
---
Discussion of private servers is disallowed here, try posting this on r/wowservers instead.
---
I had a guy that wiped on pre-nerf/pre-fix Cthun explain to me that the only thing that prevented the raid from killing the boss was that some tentacles were spawning in unreachable/unkillable locations. As soon as this was fixed boss was killed.
---
How can you kill that which has no life?
---
They make for some great hipster Discord icons.
---
Where did you hear 4 devs, aside from the mystical birdie on your shoulder?
---
I've seen her. First time I was down there.
---
Unleashing a seal, put on soc and get a proc. You would sometimes hear the proc a half second before you saw the animation and dmg (iirc). That half second of expectation was real
---
Just [ask google](https://www.google.com/search?q=when+is+summer).
---
lock
---
I just laughed in plate mail as they wound up... I don't remember losing to hunters very often.
---
I wouldn't say amazing; it is just when you truly enjoyed something and really got "into" it that it is hard to forget certain memories.
---
If it was true then why dont they bring more than 1 AFTER the 16 debuff change. Your there to buff warlocks and that's really it.

---
Is English your native language?
---
Blizzard actually looked like the cared in 2005....
---
Now they just have zingers “You don’t want that” or “you don’t have phones?” At every Blizzcon.
---
Southern USA here. We don't go outside during the summer tooooo hot plz give us classic wow
---
It’s already been pushed back. No other reason not to have a date already.
---
That eats up to much time.
---
Okaaayyy... Note to self: Turn down contrast on monitor when Classic releases.
---
While I don't like mismatched armor, I do like that it gives set armor more prestige. When you are in town selling stuff and you see a character in a full dungeon or raid set you know they worked for it.
---
Yeah to boost people. But not tag the mobs, leave group grab all the xp and get reinvited back after pack is dead, that is what mob tagging in instances are.
---
Well face melting is definitely shadow priest over lock, Locks have more of a dotty playstyle. I'd say priests are more desired in group pvp but mainly for healing. Also in wpvp I'd say they're pretty simmilar but I'd give the edge to the priest because they just instagib people in wpvp
---
Right... but given Blizzard's stance on glitches in Classic, I'm thinking it won't be in... and I hope it won't be too.
---
They did, I understand &lt;1% of the WoW population saw original Nax, but most raids consisted of 4 or 5 shadow priests, mainly because you could heal on Loatheb but because they were just overall great in raid utility.
---
Other guilds realized this was important before Nax...
---
And the constant aspect of cheetah swapping... yeah, the rage is real.
---
I was a complete noob who was going to skip the quest when my guildmates found out, and ran me through. It was an RP guild so they made it a really epic journey, later on they 'annointed' me in a ceremony in Stormwind. 
---
Good times :)
---
**[Crab Bucket]** is an **EU Alliance** 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent auction, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.
---
https://discord.gg/qN9ywMy
---
I agree... hate using guns because of that though, makes me want to turn down the sound.
---
I could have the most mismatched armor, but as long as I can hide my helm, it doesn't bother me.
---
Huh. Never thought of that. Then again, I've never leveled as arcane. I think it might be kind of fun until level 25 or so, when I can swap and get those juicy frost talents.
---
So, guess the level ?   
---
My guess would be level 31.
---
Without tf on tank, no point in gearing dps more because they wont be able to press their buttons anyways.  Just staring at KTM.
---
Could also consider druid.
---
Dayum that's alot of mana
---
Rogues were the most overpowered class in vanilla
---
I dislike the cross realm battle grounds because they made the honor grind so much easier and unbalanced the choices for grinding out gear as a fresh lvl 60. It effectively kills off UBRS, Stratholm, etc. dungeons. Without people running pugs for those dungeons you lose out on the social aspects.
---
Achieving Rank 8 with cross realm BG's didn't take very long. Battle grounds would pop way faster than trying to find a group, travel, then clear the dungeon in hopes of having what you want drop. PvP gear was guaranteed, better than the 0.5 tier set, and felt way faster with instant queues. Now there are fewer people running pick up groups because the pvp route is the obvious choice.
---
Having to find a group and coordinate in those early dungeons was probably how you interacted with most players at 60. As Alliance it was a huge pain to get Dire Maul. It was not uncommon for a group to fall a part on the journey. Having a group wipe in UBRS was pretty common in a number of places. People remember and will share their experiences. Why do you think Leeroy Jenkins is funny and popular. We all had it happen at one point. These are all bonding experiences that bring people together. It was likely if you did well people would add you as a friend so that the grind could go faster. Same with a server side battle ground. After a good game add them as a friend and queue up together. Having a couple of a friends on the server makes the experience so much better.
---
Lot's of us don't have real life friends playing wow. So you have to build these online friendships. Shared experiences is probably the easiest way to make friends. Running server only dungeons and battle grounds make this easier.
---
lol. You copy and pasted that from an outdated Nostalrius post where rage was broken and made Alcor's OP.  Julie's Dagger is terrible. Ironfoe is clearly better than something like Timeworn Mace. Stop believing everything you read on the internet bud.
---
That does sound really good
---
I could, but i don't really like them
---
It's definitely bugged on ND, gives a 10% chance to proc CC on every tick, it should only have a 10% chance per cast. Not that anyone complains
---
So worth it though. I had that hammer for so long.
---
Well I was also doing quite a few dungeons, which makes a difference as well.  If I were not doing them, then frost would be my go-to choice.  
---
Here's the thing:  any of the missiles can proc Clearcasting.  So if you have a 10% chance to proc it, then there's a 27.1% chance that 3 missiles will trigger it, 34.39% chance for 4 missiles, and 40.951% chance for 5 missiles.  
---
When you USE clearcasting on Arcane Missiles, it's the most damage for the free cast compared to Fireball or Frostbolt.  In addition, it's enough time to get some mana from spirit regen.  For example, on Rank 2, you cast and get Clearcasting, so you cast again.  1 second into the second cast, and you're outside the five second rule, and your mana is regenerating.
---
If you happen to proc Clearcasting on the free one, then you spend a ton of time in spirit regen.
---
Thats missinformation, its actually only 3 devs, but the nightshift security guy is helping out occasionally.
---
I don't even train the skill from the trainer.
---
100% agree.
---
CC procs when "you deal damage", not "when you cast".
---
I see you are a mc veteran
---
Your guess is wildly off-mark. No judgements, we're just letting you know that you're wrong there bud.
---
I've had in my head that 12-20 people are working on it. I don't remember which interview or article gave me that impression but it's a logical number. 
---
It's almost certainly not just four devs.
---
You don’t have to do it that way. Plus if you’re bored you can always heal a dungeon which is hella fun.
---
So...um, what level do you have to be to equip the Great Dick of Azeroth? Is it BiS?
---
Personally, I agree with most of these. But I get why we shouldn’t do it. 
---
The game should be brought back as the original game. There’s probably countless things that people would change if you asked enough of them. At the end of the day, I would rather not set the precedent of allowing changes to vanilla to happen. I don’t want to risk that slippery slope where now we’re seeing all sorts of weird balance and function changes. Before you know it it’s not vanilla anymore. 
---
However, this is being approached from a unique angle. We’re starting at 1.12 as a base and implementing  phases for certain content. It’s not going to be identical. But the idea is to make it as polished (as vanilla was) and friendly and possible while still maintaining the pure core vanilla game. 
---
Personally, Id be happy to see no cross faction BGs. Yes, technically battlegroups existed by 1.12 but remember we’re rolling out this PvP system from phase 1 where no BGs exist at all. I would love to see if the servers can manage to stay amongst themselves first. If it just doesn’t work, and there’s 20 minute queues. Then by all means do what you have to. That’s just a personal opinion, however. 
---
Overall, the core game needs to stay the same. Once changes start coming they’ll keep coming. Let’s keep it pure.
---
Nah, it definitely wasn't there. I've been there a lot of times, not because of the mount but the waterfall. Great place to be. But I heard the vendor was there in the vanilla beta
---
Apart from getting them to level 60, is there a huge detriment from playing 2 classes? I could farm gold on whoever's better at it and have 4 professions, however, gearing and attuning etc doesn't seem very inviting. Does anyone have experience with that?
---
You can actually do the run even faster technically but you still need to factor in the time to run back to the start of the instance picking up chests and books along the way
---
lol no
---
In the beginning there’s not a lot to do as the father to a new born so there will be plenty of time to play. Don’t miss those waking hours though with your child!
---
That is official, yes, I can’t argue that, but I AM arguing that the OFFICIAL beginning of summer is wrong.
---
They are following solstices and equinoxes to divide the year into quadrants/seasons, but if you do that, even then summer should NOT begin right at the summer solstice. Summer solstice should be the MIDDLE of summer, as that is the PEAK of summer, not the beginning. If anything, everything AFTER summer solstice signals a waning summer as the days after summer solstice are getting shorter, so why would summer begin when the days start getting shorter? It should begin 45ish days before summer solstice, peak at summer solstice, and start going away during the 45ish days after the solstice.
---
So, even if we go by the earth’s axis (which is what solstice and equinoxes do) then we are STILL calculating it wrong.
---
yep 200 on reddit crying about release date will change blizzard mind. flawless tactic :)
---
Well it wont be the same game in the sence that we are getting the 1.12 pre-tbc patch, and the game has massivly changed with new mentallity.   
---
But you are getting classic wow nodoubt, they have been very clear on they want to give the real experiance
---
The Great Dirk of Azeroth!
---
- Tryhard Holy Paladin, should be 60 within 1st reset.
---
- PVE only
---
- NA, Best Coast, looking for 8/9pm raid time
---
That time slot though, seems to be killing me.
---
Nomnomnomnom!!
---
BEAUCOUP BIEN
---
No no no, everyone see’s her down in the Tram, the urban legend is being able to see her out in the wild and figuring out exactly where the tram goes and where that sighting of her translates to a location in the regular world.
---
I enjoy nuking people as Arc/frost. ZG trinket + Arcane Power, 1 casted frostbolt, 1 more while its traveling, and a POM frostbolt. As long as 1 crits, that kills most people in about 3 seconds =D
---
He attac
---
But most importantly
---
Let’s scale it back a bit with the puns.
---
OHHHH! Nice! I used to wonder about this when I was waiting for the boat in menethil.
---
most dm items are at least MC level, those blues are fuckin OP. so if the pathing does not get fucked, you should go for it
---
Arcane blast wasn't until bc
---
Exactly why he said they could suck it.
---
I've always wondered what kind of jobs let you play WoW at work without getting caught?
---
I agree with everything you said except for them not being great healers in PvP. Their HOTs are decent and their mobility in world pvp is unmatched. 
---
But yea this guy wants to play a paladin for sure.
---
Might be worth trying out a ping tunneler like wtfast too. I can’t remember what I used specifically to play Monster Hunter Online but it reduced the latency a fair bit.
---
I think warriors are the forgotten masters. There were many of them and once they had really good gear their damage was getting absurd. So many people didnt realize how high the ceiling was for stance dancing.
---
Buncha BWL geared players running around starter zones farming all the Peacebloom.
---
This was unheard of in 2004.
---
You can save as a spreadsheet file and likely also as a PDF. There are similar lists floating around this reddit and on the web.
---
Yeah people sucked, but you won't have to deal with that this time around.
---
I agree they are fantastic in PvP, just not as dedicated PvP healers. They oom quickly, their best heals can be dispelled. I'm more talking about WSG esque premade groups. You're right in world pvp they are unmatched
---
Cor = corruption
---
GCD = Global Cooldown  
---
DPS = Damage per second  
---
NF = Nightfall (the talent)  
---
ofc = Ofcourse  
---
DC = Deathcoil  
---
Sbrun = Shadowburn  
---
CD = Cooldown  
---
LT = Lifetap  
---
I used quite a few abbreviations as I typed this on my phone, if any case they were unknown or unclear they are listed now in full.
---
That's what the tooltip says, but chance per cast was how it actually worked in retail vanilla.
---
My first character was a human mage and I played it as a total noob. Went 0-60 as a fire mage and didn't even respec for endgame content because big numbers=Awesome DPS! (I did respec for MC).
---
I know this goes against a lot of the beliefs on this sub, but I personally hope they plan some minor class balance changes. There are a lot of sub par specs that are going to be largely ignored otherwise, and it’s gonna lead to the same handful of specs being played by everyone, which is a bit boring imo. Vanilla had a lot of problems, and I don’t understand why everyone is against changing some things while keeping with the general philosophy behind the game.
---
This is from patch 1.12 people talking about burning crusade in the chat.
---
[deleted]
---
Didn’t someone already suggest this recently? It was just as terrible an idea then
---
Whaaat, would you be able to find that clip? I've must have missed that
---
That's hilarious and amazing.
---
Also the Cheap Shot sound. It uses a different sound now in modern WoW and it's nothing short of a travesty.
---
Here's my reply from a similar thread:
---
I have been debating on going gnome vs dwarf for months, I have decided to go dwarf. I did some testing and while gnome is great, you can farm FAPs or restorative potions to do the same thing as gnome. There is nothing comparable to stoneform to substitute it's function.  Not to mention the amount of Orc warriors you're going to run into. Being able to easily remove a bleed so you can bandage and restealth in a blind is great. 
---
I've been playing gnome on a private server pvping against a ton of mages and while escape artist is useful, there inevitably will be times where it is just wasted vs a good mage, or the fight could've easily been won without escape artist.  Dwarf turns the tide much more than that, every time you use stoneform the enemy will notice it, and every time you use it it will give you options that were never available as a gnome. Tons of different things you can do to rogues, Warriors, etc with a clean restealth. 
---
When the game has been out for a long time and everyone has accumulated a lot of resources and have restorative/FAPs on constant keybind escape artist will be nowhere near as valuable as stoneform. Think long term.
---
Could you elaborate on the nuance in stance dancing? Sounds pretty interesting as a new player
---
One of the things my brother-in-law and I used to do was to find odd talents, spec and gear to support it, and then proceed to take out Meta Specs in PvP when they don’t know how to respond to it. 
---
I’ve always said the only broken specs are the ones that you can support via talents, gear, and a solid rotation. If you can get all 3 of those on a “memespec” then you can roll the cookie cutters all day. I’ve only ever run into a few specs that were truly broken.
---
What annoys is that they *still* add flat secondary stats despite how it conflicts with new expansions. Why add things like "You gain 25% Critical Strike chance against the targets for 15 sec" when you know you're just going to have to manually disable them in the future? Why not have the effect give the amount of crit *rating* that corresponds to a 25% crit chance at the expected level. Then the effect will naturally become less effective as players outlevel it.
---
Shadowmeld can be great for killing time and messing with people. Shadowmeld in Black Rock mountain and mind control unsuspecting people off the edge into the lava. Or stealth at the top of the Freewind post elevator in 1k needles and MC people off the edge. You can also MC people off Zeppelins and Boats. 
---
That alone is totally worth rolling Nelf over dwarf or human
---
There was a guy like this on altar of storms. He would all but afk in bgs, doing work at home and making sure he moved his character in AV every few minutes. He did actively play, but wasnt very good. He would pull 800k-1.5mil honor a week during AV. Held the 14 spot for a long time. Not 9 months, as BC dropped before then, but a damn long time. Enough for all the hardcore pvpers to dislike the guy
---
I’m guessing you’re the same guy that posted this one the wow forums too.
---
&gt; destro warlock is also
---
I love destro lock, but man, that loss of sustain is hard to take.  Basically makes you a mage without free food or evocation.
---
You could just priest and wand people to death.
---
It’s definitely not “high end level damage”. Your raid must have sucked tbh.
---
you would Def be famous for using reg pallies and ele shammies... since you clearly have a cross faction raid!
---
It really is server dependant. Back in Vanilla I remember population being Alliance dominant for the most part. Hopefully there is some consideration to keeping server ratio balanced. Annoying for queue times to be the higher pop faction. 
---
If you want to be increase your chance to win run with a premade group. Then it shouldn't matter which faction you pick.
---
I define summer as June 21 - September 22.
---
Yes please. This sounds completely ideal to me. Played MC, BWL, AQ in vanilla but I was a young lad with no idea what I was doing. 
---
Now I'm (unfortunately) a responsible adult with a job. I want to raid again, but I don't have guaranteed days off each week. I want to PVP, but mortgage payments are expensive. 
---
You mentioned you're recruiting?
---
15 man? shit. This feels like an intervention. Haha. Do I have to go to a home now?
---
&gt;Bro this isn't a debate. You are wrong. My statement about how people act without sharding unlike yours is not an opinion. It's history that has played out time and, time again across many servers.
---
Alright link me statistics or any sort of data that proves this. This isn't a debate because you are deluded and blinded by nostalgia.
---
&gt;Secondly 6 months after release I expect classic will be more popular then retail for the social connections it forms. Retail is a parasite that thrives and lives on nostalgia. Once classic arrives retail is a niche game for hardcore neck beards who want to do Mythic 7 and Arena.
---
This is so delusional I'm not even gonna bother. 
---
&gt;One of the mistaken reasons you most likely think Retail will be more popular then classic. Is that you are probably mistaking people who don't have time. With people who are "casual" players. Retail only appeals to the hard core and the hard core hard pressed on time. I could never get my father into retail it's just too much for him. He's pumped for classic though. Why? Because the game is far more easy and accessible for an old man. The game also motivates people to ask him for help. Which is why he likes to play a priest. He doesn't always know what to do because he's so casual. So he loves the fact people want him to be around so he can fill the role.
---
You are confusing casual players with bad players. If your dad doesn't know what to do and fails at basic mechanics it means he's just bad. It has nothing to do with being casual. 
---
&gt;That again was part of the magic,
---
Yeah, 15 years ago. I know your delusions won't let you think otherwise, but gaming culture changed in the last 15 years and people moved on, even if you didn't.
---
We are. If you’re playing on UK/EU servers drop me a message and I’ll shoot you a Discord link
---
hopefully this gets nerfed
---
VE was legit and our SP would beat some of the crappier healers in total healing on boss fights. His DPS was meh though, he was a really good player but could never come close on the DPS charts unless it was a really specific fight that fucked over melee or non shadow casters
---
I think they added the panther cub thing to that cave many years later to make a nod to the rumor
---
Cool
---
first! :P
---
Literally? Gonna need a source man
---
&gt; Then it's not a math problem as claimed by these thread.
---
cool but...
---
&gt;Also off-topic fact: The person who wrote that was Ion Hazzikostas the current Game Director of WoW.
---
They said get ready for a classic summer. Also games get delayed all the time
---
Source on the confirmation?
---
But thats not melee
---
The most i’ve seen is officer chat being used as an ic voice channel but that’s about it.
---
Guild chat was pretty much memes until our GM banned them when we gave him enough of a headache with them lmao.
---
ACHCTUALLLY.... Arcane is the go to spec from MC to AQ.
---
The new website is awesome and really responsive. Great work!
---
Ahhh damn, gonna be playing NA. Best of luck when Classic launches!
---
Well there is more to it than just big burst, having a pet that can act while you are CCed makes you much better in 1v1, and NF/conflag lets you get some pretty great burst with only the 1.5 sec immolate hard cast and a little NF luck where mages and shaman are much more reliant CDs and on standing still hard casting to drop big numbers, you also have access to two good spell schools if you get locked out. 
---
Honestly by the time you have gear to be going for a destro/fire spec the damage values almost become irrelevant because the damage scales faster than health.
---
Hes flagged as pvp so I like to kill him just as people get to moon brook. 
---
This will be on a pve server so by the time anyone comes to stop me I'll already be unflagged and ready to kill the next one.
---
&lt;Entitled&gt; - 6:30 - 9:00 (9:30) PST - Wens/Thurs – Alliance – PVP
---
Do you want to raid with a bunch of mediocre aging adult’s whose only claim to fame is hyping up the accomplishment’s they share with millions of other mediocre WoW players? Well boy howdy do I have a guild for you! We’ve been P server heroes for the better part of a decade and our accomplishments are long and circle jerky about a bunch of shit a bunch of other people did too. But hey we did it wasted so there’s that!
---
Zero-Sum DKP with oversight is our go to for vanilla loot fair, simple and easy. 
---
Our Minor Requirements are always as follows:
---
Be 21+  (sorry kids, unless you're that one token 17 year old we all get to make fun of ofc) and Show up with your god damn addons, consumables and 15 prior to raid it’s not hard.
---
We do run meme specs and if you would like to apply as one, understand it has high requirements. Searching for our forever shadow priest currently.

Not the same my dude
---
please no
---
pservers are so far from the gold standard of mechanics its not even funny
---
This guild is so bad...ofc
---
The worst
---
Yeah, plus you have the talent that gives you 0% pushback too, i can see why it'd be alot of fun.
---
I personally got 5/5 IAOTH 
---
if you're good with pet management you don't really need the additional HP
---
The worst ofc
---
All the credit goes to this guy right here ^^^^^^^^^
---
Did he says "Druids, who spend most of their time raiding in Moonkin form..." you lost me....
---
Hahahaha what an utter dunce!
---
Bubble hearth in the middle of a horde raid.
---
I'm unfamiliar with current sharding mechanics, but does retail put you into a queue if the server is full or do they throw you into a different server since they have that capability with sharding?
---
The problem is just that there are no fun combat spels in arcane, or good for dps in any way. You have 4 in combat spells in arcane, arcane missil, arcane balst, blink, and mana shield. You also have 2 spells that you get form the talant tree, Presences of mind and arcane power, one of which does nothing with your other arcane spels.
---
In vanilla wow arcane is built from the ground upp as support for your two other schools of magic, this gets changed later on but trying to go pure arcane in vanilla wow is a bit like specing resto on a druid to be a tank because the three got a few talents that support it and you can heal yourself better.
---
"Arcane" is still the best dps spec for mages for about half the game, even if frost bolt will be the main damage spell.
---
Spam clicking all charges off a priest's Lightwell.
---
I can't wait to try leveling as ret in Classic. Going holy later on for sure, but there was always something so appealing about seeing ret pallies with sweet weapons and those giant procs.
---
heard it here first bois! who needs mana anyway, lets just chug those healing potions coz we can!
---
A lot of work has gone into the website, and I can attest to that personally. My sincere thanks to Roddeh, Sams and Halwin on the behalf of the Classic Community for making such a great project happen. 
---
It's another reminder why the Classic community is the best :)
---
Here's to finding old friends and discovering new ones!
---
the worst tbh
---
I’m not looking forward to the inevitable raider.io addon for classic. You know people are going to time runs and still use scores to invite players and unless you get ahead of the curve with friends it could be rough to get groups after the first few weeks. Either that or gearscore will definitely be a bigger thing than in vanilla.
---
I gave up recently on the July 16th hope. They are releasing the BFA patch that month, and I am not sure blizzard wants them releasing at the exact same time. Who knows but i no longer feel july is likely at this point =p
---
Min/maxing and rushing to 60 IS how I enjoy the game. 
---
By all means enjoy your casual play, and I'll enjoy hunting casuals down, theory-crafting my dps, and leading my guild through 40 mans.
---
Disagree with UI changes, what I would like is for it to be easy for people to develop mods, particularly raid frames, cast bars and hero portraits. Designing my own UI was one of my favourite parts of the game because it could look and feel exactly how I wanted it and everything was where it felt natural and correct. There were many beautiful UI's made for all kinda purposes and that option for customisation should stay the same! (EG: My favourite package was Caith)
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon\_skill](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill)
---
The question is, is it faster? I feel like partying up with a high level and letting them just AoE spam through a dungeon while the lower level player gets a lower amount of xp per mob is still faster than slowly drudging through a dungeon, pretty much pulling a mob one or two at a time while the higher level player kills the enemies one or two at a time for higher xp.
---
Evidently they also never had their face blasted clean off by an ele shaman, too.
---
Thats the top tier strategy when youre trying to beat the priest on the healing meter.
---
undead is only strong in early game when people have shitgear. once people have like bwl level of gear shadowguard for example outscales the horribly scaling dp and it only gets worse from there.
---
and ?
---
it´s 12 devs + some ppl and it will not be 100% like classic because of lost data but it seems to be 99% like it was. We will see though, it´s reasonable not to get the hope up because we all know blizzard could fuck it up somehow any second.
---
Im surprised no one mentioned priest (disc or trispec). I felt like there was an insane difference in terms of priests while i was ranking.
---
My votes would be hunter, mage, (non shadow) priest. No particular order.
---
&gt;"For the learning phase, expect the raiding week to be an entire week with any downtime spent farming materials and crafting consumables."
---
You're assuming the private server full buff meta will come to classic. We don't know that yet. In retail vanilla hardcore members weren't farming 24/7, not even close.
---
Lower procrate but the scaling on both is pretty good.
---
&gt;and ?
---
***"And"*** he knows more about this now, and knew more about this then, than you or your pserver admins do today.
---
Spriests aren’t really desired in group pvp, they’re ok but bring more to the table as a healer/utility hybrid. In organised pvp there will be healers and dispellers which limits what a spriest can do a lot.. where as lock can turret damage with shadow bolts even with dispellers.
---
Yes, anything that counts as a spellcast. I used to use it fairly regularly with Divine Favor and Holy Light for a free instant critical heal at points.
---
Damn we are the same. Except I don't know if I have even one friend now.
---
That was really a thing and they were pretty successful
---
They actually stack 20 fury warrior for their server first and speed run. They all have 2 alts to split these warriors into 3 raids when on farm so gear shouldn't be a problem for them.
---
The concept is that using certain abilities required you to be in certain stances (imagine them being defensive, neutral and offensive). Many skills were usable in 1 or maybe 2 stances, with only a very selected few being baseline. So in order to use your abilities to your fullest you had to change your stance regularly (dancing). The difficult part about that was that your rage was instantly chopped down to 10 (iirc 20 with talents) so you had to anticipate changing stances in order to not lose excess rage and build up enough to use the desired ability. Sometimes it was even worth to switch stances purely for the passive bonus. Defensive stance reduced both incoming and outgoing damage, so you wanted that (plus maybe even shield) when your opponent had a stunlock (rogue) or burst (boomkin, fire mage) phase incoming. Meanwhile berserker stance increased incoming damage by 20% and outgoing by 10%. So you wanted that during your own burst phases or your opponent down phases.
---
All wrong. Warlock is the biggest face melter in Classic pvp. A geared warlock can literally 3 shot people with the right spec. You’ve never seen the drakedog movies?
---
Sweeping Strikes + WW or Cleave
---
I can almost hear the corpses whispering, "Wtf just killed me? I still had half health."
---
WTB reddit flair for him?
---
Go look at the opening ceremony for blizzcon 2018? I'm on my phone so not going to Google it for you right now lol. But it literally says in the open ceremony SUMMER 2019!
---
You are going to be out of shards every 30 minutes? Yeah right.
---
I remember drooling on all my desks due to sleeping face down in every class during HS! Pretty sure the teachers thought I had a terrible home life so they let me sleep... Well maybe I did...
---
Have you been following classic at all? That was one forum post. Blizzcon announced it for a summer 2019 release
---
Talking about design, I love so much these icons, it's more comunicative, memorable and simple rustic style. Damn the hype is real!
---
Yet they didn't know about using huge thing like dire maul and song flower world buffs which are like 30% dps increase (even Kungen who got the world first kt kill said they didn't think about using that).
---
I think the patch was mostly bug fixes, one of the major problems with Original C'Thun was how buggy it was. There was a pretty high chance to just instantly die when going inside.
---
&gt; "We are restoring the 16 debuff limit. 'Now why are we doing that?' you might ask, if it's frankly, objectively, worse design. That actually implicates the third point in my original philosophy slide, which is, we don't want to mess with the 1.12 data, we don't want to mess with balance. If we change the code in this regard, who's to say what effects that would have on balance in raids, in PvP, and elsewhere. Maybe, suddenly, dot classes like Warlocks and others, are far more effective then they had been, and we have actually a different outcome, a different metagame, than the original classic experience produced, and that would actually be deviating from authenticity." -Ion Hazzikostas, BlizzCon 2018
---
Blizzcon being the official blizzard convention where they released news for everything important. Seems like you dont know what it is
---
32
---
i've noticed that on some servers, but not on others. it's pretty great when it works like that. i remember leveling on one of the servers as arcane and i got like 4-5 clearcastings in a row, rarely had to drink.
---
The story about the Grand Marshal is completely true - it happened on my first server. I was a paladin in the guild &lt;Drunken Lords&gt; on Daggerspine. The Grand Marshall was a druid named Kuroma (aka - The Kuromabot) from the guild &lt;War for Profit&gt;. I don't know if he kept it for an entire year, but he definitely kept it for months after he had already achieved rank 14.  
---
To add to the urban legend of it though, I recall people talking about how he hadn't logged off for days at a time - morning, noon, night, always in a BG - and not afk - actually playing.   
---
I also heard later, but this was after I had already moved to a new server, that he was the first player to hit something like a million honor kills.   
---
So yes, the legend of Kuroma is - to some extent - true.
---
Hey folks,
---
Canadian player in MST time zone here. Played quite a bit in Vanilla. Have experience with clearing MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20, and up to Huhuran in AQ40. I've also leveled a couple 60's on private servers, with limited raiding on those characters.
---
I'm looking to raid 2 or 3 nights a week semi hardcore, but my work schedule might be a hindrance. I work noon to midnight on a 4 on 4 off schedule (so never the same days of the week). In keeping with this, I'd like to find a guild that raids on hours that would work for me (ideally something late night or very different time zone?). 
---
I have interest in PVP but my focus early will be reaching 60 in a timely fashion and getting into MC. PVP server preferred. Hard to want to PVP before the honor system is put into place.

Looking for: a competitive/hardcore/semi-hardcore PvE guild with mature, reliable people
---
Inspired by the legendary Pat PvP 2 video, I started playing WoW a year into Vanilla as a Tauren warrior named Macbain on Agamaggan. This go around, I'd like to see what it was like to be Alliance (I'm going to miss windfury so bad though!).
---
Since I began so late and played so much PvP, I only managed to clear MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ 20 on live as an off tank/dps warrior before TBC. I was in college then as well so I had little time to dedicate to the game. Despite my casual attitude then, I played far more than I should have, just like everyone else did at the beginning of the game. After earning my Tabbard of the Protector, I've played every expansion off and on with a range of classes but tend to enjoy the OG tanking master, warrior, the most. I long to rekindle those ancient days of the true glory of the warrior once again.
---
Throughout the course of WoW, I've become a highly experienced tank and would like to find and journey with adventurers of similar talents. I'm never absent or late, I don't stand in the fire, and I know the importance of min/maxing as a tank in Vanilla. But I also know that the real thing that sets apart competitive guilds in wow is guildmates' dedication to one another.
---
Lately, I've been playing a little on unnamed realms to get back that nostalgic feeling and to remember how to play during that bygone era.
---
I'd like to find a group of people that I can journey with throughout the course of Classic from questing on up as I miss the feeling of comeraderie that was inherent to Vanilla. Drama is something I work very hard to keep out of my life so I'd prefer to spend time with mature folks, especially if I'm going to sink real time into this game again. Ultimately, I'd like to clear Naxx someday with my time investment, a good bunch of people, and a whole lot of loyalty.
---
I live by routine, work full time, and have an exercise regimen that I take very seriously but other than that I have few real commitments.
---
If you think we could be friends, just send me a pm here on reddit.
---
Cheers, and I hope we meet someday soon in Azeroth!
---
&gt; rogues build combo points
---
This part is not true. In Vanilla, combo points are tied to the target, and not on the rogue. If you combo points on target A, and you tab over to target B, congrats - you just lost all your combo points.
---
Deep arcane with frost has always been the go-to raiding specs in early raiding environments.
---
I feel like I don't use SS often enough, but when I do, it's sooo satisfying. You kind of have to expect to get aggro though in PVE.
---
Honestly you just simply aren't bright enough to grasp what I am saying. So we'll just wait and, you will just get to see in real time how wrong and silly you are
---
ALRIGHT! We get it.
---
It depends on how quickly you level. It will be a little more difficult then your Vanilla experience I would imagine. The supply/demand on low level stuff will make the AH was less profitable. It is still definitely possible to afford your mount without ever using the AH.
---
Here you go [https://imgur.com/GhnFVeO](https://imgur.com/GhnFVeO)
---
So it was the most unsatisfying for me, but most satisfying for my opponent I'm sure. I just earned the Grand Master arena trinket on my gnome warrior that took a few months of waking up super early in the morning to get and having friends/strangers help me complete. I finally got it, couldn't wait to use it in a battlegrounds -- charged in like a boss to a group of horde. Popped the trinket....!.....and it immediately got purged by a shaman. FML
---
MC and BWL are such a steamroll that I've never even bothered speccing something other than deep frost lol
---
The new rat has a chance to drop the same item again. What's way worse is that you can only have one such item on you at any given time, so you can't farm them.
---
That wasn't our servers expectation. Everyone who hit r14 quit premades (as expected) and popped in here and there casually to have fun. No one was expected to stay in group and grind.
---
Only for a little while, it got patched.
---
This worries me.
---
Also worth mentioning are times you also get cheap instants like overpower and execute during SS.
---
...also the real answer's obviously Berserker Rage.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
You lose current standing not position in honor for the week. That's why it double doesn't make sense. zzz
---
Tell me again how level impacts resist on bosses and what impact THAT has on magic damage against those bosses?
---
Once you have that information we can entertain a talk about how accurate the pserver vs retail comparison you are trying to make is.
---
When you say your going to main Shaman, and then the wheel lands on shaman.
---
Well then, the wheel decreed it so I guess that’s that.
---
omg
---
Blizzards stance on cosmetics is the worst. It's not consistent, appears to purposefully limit fun and needlessly restrictive. This goes for all character customization. It feels like they're worried people will have too much fun and stop their stupid content required grinds.
---
Sit down to regenerate mana faster.
---
lock in raid = secured raid slot
---
spriest in raid could get a slot but you didn´t want more than one
---
destro lock could melt faces, but needs good gear to be effective
---
affli lock would dot and fear 
---
about spriest in pvp idk much
---
My guild did this as well, except we didn't even use computers at all.
---
My prot pala feels left out
---
If it's a proc, it won't work.
---
Flat stat increases do work though

\*\*&lt;CREW&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English\*\*
---
\*\*Introduction\*\*
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere.

We are especially looking for: Hunters, Resto Shaman, Rogues.   
---
We are also absolutely looking for socials/non-raiders! 
---
\*\*Goals\*\*
---
\* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
\* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace. 
---
\* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months). 
---
\* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server. 
---
\* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
\*\*Member Expectations\*\*
---
\* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
\* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
\* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
\*\*Core values\*\*
---
\* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
\* Common sense and patience. 
---
\* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
\* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
\* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.

It's great for the solo grind.
---
Mostly I'm tanking in dungeons... That gives me a good idea though, I should really consider using it as the tank sometimes.
---
&gt;are far more enjoyable to watch
---
o_o
---
Lol yeah a 13% chance according to the video. Doesn't sound worth it at all. (But I'm not a hardcore min maxer.)
---
I don't think he's lying, he was just raiding with really really really bad players.

I mean, isn't this whole meme build suboptimal in the first place?
---
This ones a favourite in RTS games. An absolute classic.
---
Are the enchants I named procs? In vanilla it just says "Fiery weapon"
---
the hell you talking about? I don't go on wow forum that where all lefty beta male goes to
---
Find some vanilla video of a caster doing dps on a boss, get the same gear and buffs than him, do the same rotation and compare. Wow dps is almost the same.

Yeah sorry I can't respond any better to things rooted in complete fiction. You don't seem to understand the difference between 2005 and 2019, no clue about current wow, completely deluded about Vanilla wow, have no understanding of modern gaming market or culture, and somehow think you are the smart one here. Honestly you are too stupid to comment on this topic so avoid doing it in the future.
---
But this is not vanilla...

Kuroma: A night elf druid who, along with several others from his guild, held [**Grand Marshal**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Grand%20Marshal) rank for over 6 months. He was famous for very rarely speaking to anyone outside his guild and for having sporadic changes in [**play-style**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=play-style), which some claim was proof of account sharing or of him being a bot.
---
Mind control
---
Damn. Well hopefully you got more worthy use of it later =D
---
Hahaha, ok man
---
Doesnt it require battle stance? I suppose it would be especially good for caster packs, or grps with just 2 elites.
---
People should ignore this list, very outdated
---
Transmog is one of my very favorite things in Retail, and I love going back to old content for new armor and weapons to slap on my character. However, even with that said, I would hate to see it get implemented to Classic. Even ignoring nochanges, there really is something appealing about the idea of walking into Ironforge and spotting a dude in full Bloodfang or something like that, and say to yourself, “That person’s seen some cool shit.”
---
You need better friends.
---
I like the idea of WotF getting out of some cc but I dont remember sleep or charm to be very common. Getting out of fear would be what its used for most right? I think gnome was the best on ally side for warrior pvp group and 1v1 because of how you could deal with cc with the escape artist passive but im kinda leaning towards orc tbh. I just want a horde gnome :(
---
Haha you’re definitely lying for attention on the internet. 
---
Good thing you don’t care that you’re judged for it.
---
Fiery is proc
---
What are your opinions on WOTF?
---
People do it cause once you've ran the same raid 50 some times you get your fun out of pushing meters. No one is forced to do anything, my guild literally doesn't have consume or world buff requirements but everyone still gets them. If your not into that type of stuff join a guild of like minded people.
---
Don’t listen to this guy. 
---
He’s clearly full of shit.
---
Oof, I'm caught red handed, sorry dude. I personally liked the video and your voice. There obviously wasn't much editing but it's not something I always aim for. I like informative videos and this was good.
---
I played WoD without issue for 2 days at launch.
---
Death coil. 2 minute I win button.
---
Yes. Fiery has a chance on hit to proc, so it won't work.
---
Basically you don't use your weapon to attack while shapeshifted, so anything that requires a hit with a weapon won't work
---
It's amazing how you can craft your own reality without ignoring the facts. Amazin'. "Just because the data is made up doesn't mean it's easier" lmfao YES IT DOES.
---
And then you encounter a mob with 510 hp
---
510 HP - 100 DMG = 410 HP  
---
410 HP - 100 DMG = 310 HP  
---
310 HP - 100 DMG = 210 HP  
---
210 HP - 100 DMG = 110 HP  
---
110 HP - 100 DMG = 10 HP
---
10 HP - 100 DMG = 0 HP  
---
Hits to Kill = 6
---
510 - 110 = 400  
---
400 - 110 = 290  
---
290 - 110 = 180  
---
180 - 110 = 070  
---
070 - 110 = 0  
---
Hits to kill = 5
---
Yeah, if I ever level a shammy, I'm probably leveling as ele. I always love having an ele shammy in dungeon grps, they just cleave through shit. ... and then drink 30 seconds per pull too, though.
---
more busted for fury due to edgemaster's
---
Which country?  I want to look up what country has a different interpretation of seasons that the rest of the world.
---
WF would also proc off of WF. Weapons proc'ing off themselves got fixed long before 1.12.
---
Grind rested exp.
---
Cool beans gibbon. Glad to see someone who can't even grasp the point I'm making thinks I'm wrong. I think I can live with that.
---
Thanks guys.  The first edition of the website was great.  This version seems to be even better.  Thanks for all the hard work everyone.  You guys are helping re-create communities.
---
Yes. 
---
On my server, the horde were not competitive after the decent horde guilds left in a free transfer. To get the gates open, our guild farmed the horde mats as well as our own and sent them through the neutral AH to get the gates open since horde didn’t care to do it.
---
A similar thing on my server (Arthas US).  I think the top prize was a run through MC for the winner and a few of your friends where you could loot anything you wanted as well as a Nef head.  They had other prizes for BoEs and things as well.
---
I preferred to sell things on the AH for crazy amounts and got a couple epic mounts out of my farming.
---
How long do you need to give notice?
---
All I need is like a week and I'm good.  I usually put it on the calendar ahead of time so I can't get roped into other things.  Also, how long are you guys actually taking off?  I'm literally going to do launch day and that's it.  IDK, I love WoW and can't wait for classic, but I can't imagine sitting there in front of a PC for longer than a day anymore.
---
Nice thanks!
---
and yet people will still make fun of us at every chance they get. life is suffering
---
I more meant the mats. I don't know how much Blood of the Mountain goes for on the AH, but if you're not running MC then your best bet is to go on BRD runs to get it from ore veins or mob drops.
---
Because it's easy and people still like these procs.
---
The choice is to either have some item power leveling like they already tried that and many people didn't like it because people like item drops more.
---
Yes retail is a very different game and Blizzard has made a lot of non ideal decisions in hind sight but they kept the game running they couldn't do it if they kept the same mechanics as Vanilla for 15 years.
---
Ahhh, my eyes!
---
However, this is how you are supposed to look like as a mid-level scrub!
---
My own reaction the first time I saw that done. Wish the idea was originally mine, but it wasn't.

---
If it's one spec, then it can't be "all wrong". It's partly right.
---
I get your point, its just retarded and only makes sense in your mentally ill head.
---
beserker stance didn´t increase dmg, it gave you 3% crit
---
Honestly I'm gonna build a sick dps warrior based on what talents I think are going to fit my playstyle best. What's the point of having the most "optimal" build if it isn't fun?
---
30/0/21 hybrid build works for Shaman but you will just be an effective, but less effective Healer role in raids. You won't be used for DPS which I think is your point.
---
One of the things my brother-in-law and I used to do was to find odd talents, spec and gear to support it, and then proceed to take out Meta Specs in PvP when they don’t know how to respond to it.
---
Druids are honestly bad and I wouldn't take more than 2. They are awesome if they are bear tank though. They can take a hit.a
---
 Almost always prefer another pally buff or wind fury totem/chain heal spam.
---
Requires you switch into it for a second, only a problem if you're barely surviving.
---
Oh thats good, how long would you say the GY run is?
---
No, 1 weapon skill = 0.04% chance to hit and crit. Nowhere near 3%
---
Hah, it's totally fine! I was just messin'. I know it was a pretty raw/rough video that was needlessly long and there's no harm in not preferring that. Just happened to stumble on this post months later and had a laugh about it.
---
Happy cake day!

Tell me more about how you can tell from a pixelated 2006 video what items a mage has equipped in their... 
---
* trinket 1
---
* trinket 2
---
* ring 1
---
* ring 2
---
* neck
---
* pants
---
* shoes
---
* wand
---
slots. Then go ahead and tell me how you can tell what enchants they have on ***ANY*** slot.
---
Arcane is literally the best mage raiding spec until aq40.
---
You don't use DS in PvP and SM/Ruin is very legit for raiding, at the very least it is the second best spec behind DS/Ruin and the difference is not even big. I'm most likely going to be rolling a lock again when classic launch and I have no intentions to raid as anything other than affliction, for me it is the optimal raid spec you don't need corruption to make it good.
---
Yes, especially your last part. It was about perfecting your execution. Which is why i think consumables are a crutch so to say, yes they make the kills easier obviously, but they allow for more misstakes. So consume whoring is more about brute forcing the fight rather than perfecting it.
---
A stress test would be nice.
---
Not every time you use it, but Counterspelling a Hammer of Wrath is easily the most satisfying use of an ability in the game for me. Sure, it's nice to CS anything fast, but Hammer of Wrath is just all the nicer, because you just caught a 0.5s cast, locked out literally all his spells AND denied his execute. And that's not even the best part! No, the best part is seeing the Paladin just stand still for a good 2 seconds afterwards in plain disbelief.
---
Procs don't work in form, only flat bonuses work.
---
Omg it's my cake day holy crap thanks
---
Hmm. Using whatever map/questing add-on is most popular, the distance to corpse when you get ganked while up north or deep in the logging area is like 1800m or higher. 4 minute run at optimal pathing.
---
That's what makes it possible to use in solo play.  In group play, if your tank is doing his job, you have 0% pushback regardless.
---
Yeah, you are right. The 10% / 20% was only up until patch 1.2.
---
I've heard different people say it worked different ways in Vanilla.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say. You don't need to be out of shards to claim your free shard every 30 minutes.
---
I'm worried that pserver players will think they have played the game like it was in 2004, and start making guides off of incorrect information before the game comes out.
---
Rofl. Why do you keep referencing an irrelevant quote? 
---
They explicitly stated that it would be released in the summer of 2019. I can’t believe you’re *still* arguing about this when the information has been available and widely known since BlizzCon 2018. You just look a fool right now...
---
It’s the one spec every single warlock who knows what he’s doing will use. Dot specs are nonexistent in vanilla pvp. So yeah you’re entirely wrong.
---
Fight the power, brother
---
Yes! Released TBC would be heaven
---
A+ on the music
---
Had an MC world first and Ony US top ten I think with a combo raid.
---
That’s them frantically trying to click their bubble.
---
They are releasing 8.2 raid on July 16th so I highly doubt it's even going to release on this day. I'm surprised nobody has picked up on this.
---
I like the layout it looks great!
---
Druid weapons are purely stat sticks.  No weapon or enchant procs.
---
After calculating given variables I have assigned you the class druid.
---
:(
---
I don't think anyone should be shamed for what they want to do with their vacation time. I don't intend on powerleveling to 60 but I sure as hell am taking time off to enjoy classic as soon as it comes out.
---
Priests are better healers. Both can grind with little downtime due to dot and wand with priest or cat form with druid. It's hard to say. I would advise priest if you want a chill laid back gameplay, druid can be pretty crazy in and out of forms etc.
---
You've just swung this conversation over to something I'm not arguing against.
---
Sure some guilds/people like pushing their dps, good for them. I also never planned on joining that kind of guild so I'm not sure what you made either of those points for.
---
I get why some guilds go full consumables, my point was that I don't think those types of guilds/consumable metas will be the norm in classic, I think they will be the exception.
---
No you really don't. Or you would have a even the slightest grasp of what I am saying. Classic wow will be so successful because of exactly what gaming culture is today. The fact that you used that to bolster your argument shows 100% you don't understand what I am saying. It's sad you struggle with this.
---
That’s actually the play. You tank the overpower over the mortal strike, ww etc.
---
I think thats mostly due to the fact that mages allready are one of the better classes and arcane wouldnt open up a new role or play style even if it was good.
---
When you get drunk, enemy's combat lower appears lower (but obviously remains the same). I thought if I was constantly drunk, enemies would be easier because... well, they're a lower level, right?
---
Obviously it isn't true, but I definitely remember it feeling easier. I guess the placebo effect was in full works.
---
Perfection.
---
Then "we wanted to achieve was to make sure all the classes that have crowd control had very limited crowd control." 
---
Now - Every fucking class has an aoe stun in addition to kicks, single target stuns, and slows.
---
Then "we didn't want to have one class that really changed the entire game"
---
Now - lets look at the MDI to see where they went wrong... \*cough\* rogue \*cough\*
---
I read about that kind of thing two days ago.  Everything was basically automated during raids. I never did scripts myself; I got into WoW shortly before TBC.
---
Its crazy how the top guilds still had trouble pushing content even with scripts. I can only imagine what it will be like this time around.
---
When I think of best wpvp class, warlock is always the one I say first. It doesn't matter what class I'm playing, I HATE fight warlocks.
---
Maybe he's 15 and associates summer with school?
---
And I kinda doubt random people that had no deal with him whispering him KYS. That just sounds ridiculous.
---
Nothing wrong with that. Just don't do that with stuff that you may want and need to recover some day, when a restore email address won't suffice.
---
But if you've still got your CC or PayPal account you've used to pay for your account, there's still a way to prove that you're the real owner (unless you've paid with a gamecard, which means you're basically screwed).
---
I assume there were players eager to take the spot anyways
---
What are those?
---
Yes, literally. 
---
https://youtu.be/VMavTMbYmrs skip to 7:25 since you need spoon feeding :)
---
Felhunter i think is far superior with spell locking and devour magic. Succubus is sooo easy to kill, dispell seductive, or trinketing out.
---
destro warlock you have like 50% more abilities than any other spec/class
---
So, 1h mace on enhancement shaman ? ;)
---
You can pay for living expenses with like 20 viewer avg?
---
I'm the same but I hide the back as well. Can't be covering that male Dwarf ass.
---
Your cant be an effective healer or dpser. You gotta pick one or the other. But pick paladin because there the best pvp healers and I would say are on par with priests in pve.
---
trouble is that the classic community is going to outright reject ret paladins... the spec is broken and the player base knows it now
---
Druids don’t have a reliable Rez.
---
Imagine being in a group with 1 tank, 3 DPS and you trying to heal and nobody has a rez...
---
&gt; There’s always going to be people buying gold. It’s not really pay to win, more like pay to save time farming (for consumables, engineering stuff, etc.)
---
Any in-game benefit you can pay for is essentially P2W. It cheapens the game and creates incentive for people to spend money.
---
Would you mind explaining your calculation process? (:
---
I am seriously thinking of playing war because I keep playing shammy in pservers and I dread the farm needed for it.
---
On the other hand, when you do get, it does feel amazing. I have seen it drop twice too!
---
Do people not realize Mages typically raid as arcane frost and not deep frost, aka more points in arcane than frost?
---
Why do you its pretty crazy in/out of forms?
---
It was already stated that there is no crossover between retail &amp; classic accounts.
---
How much would you say that druid forms &amp; stealth advantages helps for farming? Is it significant or is it just a nice advantage?
---
I like Transmogs because it allows me to have my character dress in an "iconic" outfit, and just use the gear as invisible enhancements. Feels more like "my" character when I have control over their general look.
---
So Classic wow will overtake the biggest MMO on the market because millions of people who aren't interested and have no involvement in gaming will choose to play it because they played it 15 years ago, despite gaming advancing during those 15 years and producing hundreds of more available and better games. In your head this is reality.
---
Please, get some help kid. And don't comment on this topic again.
---
Well compared to putting up a dot and wanding to death. Everything seems crazy lol.  Priest isn't my cup of tea but for sure when I've leveled one before I feel super chill.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill?oldid=267721
---
&gt;Warrior
---
Only shines in bgs and group pvp (with pocket healers), easily kited and controled in 1v1/wpvp. 
---
&gt;Paladin
---
Same as warrior, slightly worse if you are ret.
---
&gt;Spriest
---
Shines in 1v1 but easily kited in wpvp, bgs you'll have a hard time against players that know how to counter you. I'd say spriests are a cheap version of warlocks, just like feral druids are a scuffed version of rogues.
---
&gt;Mage
---
Shines in bgs and 1v1s, easily kited in wpvp against ranged ofc.
---
 It everyone uses that definition of summer though.
---
Dirty haha I love it
---
^ other pets have more utility, the damage gained generally wouldn't be worth having the imp out over Felhunter or maybe voidwalker.
---
you pretty much cant go wrong by picking a mage. so if you want a safe choice just pick a mage. pretty much a universally good class across all aspects of the game and areas and time periods of vanilla. 
---
aswell as easy to make gold with.
---
~
---
other than that. things is there is no one unified vanilla. pvping in prebis around t1 gear level, and pvping in t3 and naxx gear later to vanilla is a two different things as you can imagine (different damage and hp pools and specific items, if you didn't know all classes even got higher ranks of some spells from AQ books, which all improved the damage even more on top of the better gear). also a ton of things depend on consumable, engineering tools and other gimmicky tools you can use. there are a ton of different crap that can give you an edge.
---
Actually The Ancient Frostsaber is still the most unique ground mount tiger in the game. Its very easy to notice, unless you're one of those players who thinks its a Winterspring Frostsaber.
---
Ivory Raptor and Mottled Red Raptor also have nice coloring and are very outstanding in terms of looks.
---
The Red Wolf sadly is hard to notice because the Timber Wolf almost has the same coloring.
---
Arctic Wolf is also an easy one to spot because its the only White Unarmored Wolf in the game.
---
Palomino and White Stallion can be hard to notice because they have almost similiar reskin mounts brought into the game. (just like Red Wolf with Timber Wolf)
---
The Black Ram should be easy to notice because its the only Black Ram in the game without armor. Further Black Skins for Rams were only given through PvP Rewards.
---
The Frost Ram is kinda less noticeable because of the White Ram, but if you look closely players should be able to tell the difference because its also giving a blue color kinda (frost).
---
Black Nightsaber had a reskin (Swift Zulian Panther) and its hard to notice just like with the Red Wolf and Palomino, White Stallion.
---
Then we come over to the Kodo's. You're basically right when it comes to the Kodo's being underwhelming and not noticeable, however Blizzard did update their models so maybe they do stand out a little more now. But before and after 1.4, I highly doubt they stand out as much as majority of these mounts.
---
The White Mechanostrider Mod A has a reskin. That one is very very hard to notice without looking at the tooltip.
---
The White Mechanostrider Mod B on the other hand does have unique coloring and can be distinquished pretty easy.
---
Soyeah saying these mounts are underwhelming is certainly not true. They are rare and very unique. Its just that majority of the players dont see em because 95% of the game started AFTER they were removed. 
---
And ofc that the community has changed their views and perspectives on mounts. They rarely care about mounts these days. I would say the only special mounts ingame are the Old Vanilla mounts, Scarab Lord mount, Gladiator mounts (even tho these havent been to special lately), and probably the Crusader Mounts from the WotLK Raiding achievement.
---
"So Classic wow will overtake the biggest MMO on the market because millions of people who aren't interested and have no involvement in gaming will choose to play it because some of them played it 15 years ago" 
---
The fact that is what you got from what I said. Dude no I can't with you. Please stop.
---
the idea that killing Mr Bigglesworth somehow effected kel'thezad - either changing the amount of loot, making him more difficult, etc. (this was probably only during wrath)
---
idk know how it started, and most people agreed it was bullshit, but the superstitious among us werent taking any chances.
---
on the other hand, other wrath raids had 'hard modes' that were activated by doing or not doing certain things. it would have been cool if this little kitty actually did activate a kel'thuzad hard mode.
---
his spec is hot garbage, don't listen to noobadvice.
---
As someone who doesn’t care about my appearance much irl, and cares more about function over form, I have no problem at all with mismatched armor! I like how each piece has an appearance, and I look different when I get new gear, it adds so much to the RPG aspect of the game.
---
My friend would sometimes not wear an upgrade even though it was strictly better, because it looked goofy. I never could understand! It’s all about being as powerful as possible!!
---
Fire mage doesn't have defensive capability like you're thinking- ice block in vanilla is a frost talent so full burst Pom Pyro mage lacks the CC removal and immunity coming from block.
---
Funny coming from someone with orcs in their faction
---
Hide helm, throw on a tabbard you'll be fine.
---
Very literal trial by fire.
---
prolly, healz plx and w00t
---
Everything, including crafting, is too expensive while leveling because you need to save 90g for level 40 mount. If you spend extra money on anything then you will not have enough when you reach level 40.
---
Crafting is not profitable until 40+ because people change gear so frequently that it is not worth spending money to buy crafted gear or enchants that will be replaced promptly, AND those people are saving money for THEIR 40 mount as well.
---
There are a few crafted items that are exceptions but the competition for selling these items is so high that the price gets driven down and you're not making much profit for the time involved.
---
Enchanting is even more of a black hole to skill up while leveling because it eats directly into your main source of income while leveling which is vendoring shitty greens. You will have disenchanted 70 gold worth of greens by the time you get 175 skill, and still not at the point where you have any enchants that people are willing to pay for.
---
Even going with one of the other classes, engineering is a must to have? Are portals able to be used by other people or just on myself? Gold farming is something I’m interested in too. Mages and hunters are the best for that too right?
---
"I love buffing"
---
Paladin!
---
Well i mostly want to heal, but being able to do dmg is also nice if needed. Like i want to be able to support others, but also myself if i need to do things solo.
---
There hasn't been this much impending catastrophic hype since Bitcoin, Theranos and 2008.
---
I never hid my helm, [until I got Might helm on my Tauren] (https://fftg.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/warrior-tier-1.jpg).
---
"Consequences will never be the same."
---
Shadow is only good in 1v1 duels on flat ground with not ways to LoS.
---
How would each fare in wpvp if I’ll have two others leveling with me? Drastically better I’d assume. Probably not much better if they’re not heals though. Holy paladin and spriest are edging out to me, but mage utility sounds great with food/drink and portals.
---
Punch the keys for God’s sake!
---
Well, you can still carry a dps ret set and put it on for solo stuff while still healing specced. Priest can smite and wand. Druids still have cat form. But the best healing damage hybrid is for sure 30/0/21 shaman. You can heal dungeons and raids that are on farm with this spec and still blow shit up too.
---
That mini satellite dish
---
He's wrong on quite a few things...

I love that helmet from gnomeregan

 Dear future raiders,
---
**&lt;Drive&gt;** is a NA guild focused on progressing through end-game PvE content at a reasonably quick pace. We are aiming to reach max level within 4-5 weeks of launch and will start progression rapidly after doing so. Our primary focus will be on PvE and, as a semi-hardcore guild, we expect our members to have a healthy thirst for progression. We aim to raid 3 nights per week from \~8 PM to 12 AM EST.  
---
 **Why join us?** 
---
1.) We have stellar communication during raids and have well-defined goals that we lay out before each raid. 
---
2.) We are very accountable towards our members. We hold everyone to the same standard. 
---
3.) We are organized with our progression; we have a system for carrying out encounters.  
---
**Why should we pick you? Additionally, our expectations of our raiding core:** 
---
1.) You want to progress through raids at a reasonable pace with guys that love to banter. 
---
2.) You are prompt, organized, and provide constructive criticism. 
---
3.) You actively contribute to the welfare of the guild. This could be done through helping to gear alts, farm mats for the guild bank, research boss fights, etc. 
---
4.) You read and learn every boss fight before any attempt is made. 
---
5.) You can communicate clearly in discord. 
---

You can tell by the engineering helmet.
---
So, what you're trying to convey is there will be two separate subscriptions?
---
And are you guys casual, semi or HC? When do you plan on starting MC?
---
dorf because you can go imp sprint which is pretty much a gnome racial, stoneform allows you to reset the fight more easily
---
That seems strange maybe I'm misunderstanding this but this table is saying you have a 5.6 % chance to miss a level 63 mob with 300 skill. Each defense point being 0.04 miss chance or 0.04(15) which would be the 0.6 % added onto the base miss chance of 5% for equal level.  
---
Maybe that is correct and the prevailing 8% or 9% depending on who you talk to is incorrect I honestly can't remember and we all stacked a lot of hit for dual wield anyway. Interesting though to read.
---
Just using your spells and a few consumables is better than have the meta class/spec and missing half your gcds
---
I played both factions on multiple servers during Vanilla. Before CRBGs on Alliance, the queues took ages. On the other hand, the queues were almost instant when I played Horde. I remember Horde generally winning more, but this could just be the result of having way more practice due to no queues.
---
Does paladin have some similar build like that, because that seems interesting too.
---
Lmao come on dude, that “dot cap” existed throughout vanilla. You’re talkin shit and you know it. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
The C’thun being mathematically impossible thing wasn’t just some pissy fan rumor like level 255 bosses, Ion himself said it.
---
And bringing in private servers changes so many variables that it makes the results pointless anyway.
---
&lt;us&gt;&lt;PVP&gt;&lt;horde probs&gt;&lt;utc +10&gt;&lt;general pve I guess &gt;
---
Looking for a semi-serious pve focused guild that fits the utc 08:00-12:00 slot/utc 00:00-10:00 on Fridays and Saturdays (Aussie on AEST times here). Not intending to rush through the game having not played since 2006 but I like a group with an attitude that's best summed up as "it's a game and not a job but when you sign up to something you commit to the whole thing and you bring your a-game"
---
I enjoy a bit of everything but am generally pve focused, still I'd go mad if no one ever wanted to group up for some bgs or wpvp. Wouldn't be a good fit for a group that wants multiple times a week raid attendance, or expects players to use net builds/optimised gear set ups. Would prefer players like me who are a little older now with more responsibilies who are keen to enjoy as much as of the old content as possible from a perspective of reliving the nostalgia and fostering the old sense of community.
---
And it made the Sets much more noticeable and distinct. I spent a lot of time in awe (inspecting and wardrobing) of the 60's wearing raid gear in the main towns.
---
It's right.
---
Can you say more? No affli locks because?
---
RIP TB
---
Won't even be out when classic launches my dude.
---
What are your times in utc please.
---
Tranq shot. Oh my god its big and...nvm. OMG He's enraged- no he's not. It's like on bruce almighty when they say powers out and he just claps and says no its not.
---
That is kind of...true..but not really what people think when they say play a spec.
---
You are basically playing "frost" even though you have more points into Arcane, unless you are the one mage who gets the shaft.
---
Eh not really. I mean a lot of the "bad" specs were actually much better in pvp, but I would not say it was one of the most OP specs. It was decent though.
---
That’s how you pwn those libs /s
---
&gt; The reason classic will destroy retail is that it appeals to non-gamers and people who would never normally play a videos
---
Try not formulating your arguments like a retard then, I know its probably too much to ask, but try
---
LFG - NA | Alliance | PVP or PVE (slight preference to PVP)
---
I played casually off and on from Vanilla through Cata. Didn't do much much endgame in Vanilla besides a few MC runs. Hoping to do a decent amount this time around. 
---
I plan on rolling a Pally that I will respec to Holy at 60. Looking for a casual/moderate friendly environment that will be chill about my low-ish hours commitment but that also does some raiding. I would like to do some raiding but I know it will take me a little bit of time to get there. I will be in the Pacific time zone but would like for later raiding times (11pm-2am PST would be ideal) since my job may lead to some late-ish working hours.
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Are you playing on a PvP server? If so druid is lots of fun. 
---
Shadow priest is powerful in PvP, but honestly very boring as you use the same 2 abilities over and over.
---
I remember posting up in that cave with an alt for like months. Never saw the vendor spawn.
---
&gt; I heard that there was 4 dev working on wow classic?  
---
There has been no official word that I know of. The guys who spoke about classic at Blizzcon I believe are team leads. I doubt they'd be finishing as soon as they are with only 4 people.
---
&gt;do you thikn wow classic going be same as it was before or a bit different? 
---
We already know there's gonna be differences which cant be helped.
---
&gt; I believe wow classic won't be like what vanilla wow was just bit different if you get what I'm saying. 
---
The differences are gonna be very marginal. If were talking strictly gameplay wise it'll be the same except feel smoother.
---
gnomeregan helmet never forget
---
Great work everyone involved! High five
---
Between the three of you, make sure one can tank the another can heal. Filling DPS slots is much easier than tank or heals.
---
Gee, you mean that giving someone a higher maximum health might be hazardous to someone's health when taking fall damage?
---
A mind fuck that a priest can do to opposite faction players is the Mind Control them, and while they're under control, cast Power Word:Fortitude on them. they tend to freak out until they realize that you actually helped 'em.
---
True, but you can still enjoy TB with bank alts!
---
Yeah, wanting good gameplay to not spoon-feed tell me when I've achieved something is just incredibly insane. You games-as-a-service conditioned robots are truly sane in comparison.
---
Tempting, will loot council discussions happen in general chat or in private?
---
I'm not opposed to loot council but I've seen it handled really badly before leading to guild related drama. It's certainly better for progression than dkp but maybe worse for player retention.
---
Oh wow, there are cookies 2? But what if they don't have my favorite flavor
---
Swirly ball
---
arcane blast... did you just invent a spell? maybe you're thinking about arcane explosion.
---
1.
---
Hide shoulders in classic? Blasphemous!
---
That's so fucking goofy, I love it.
---
Yes! I love transmog in current retail, would absolutely hate it anywhere close to Classic.
---
I'd like to think semi-hc but I suppose that depends on your definition. We're not raiding 10-12+ hours a week but we're not going to put up with people who don't show up and can't follow directions either. I'd consider that semi-hc but to each their own. We're trying to do as much as possible in the 6-7 hours a week that we do. We might also add an optional extra day but we haven't talked about it yet. 
---
As for MC who knows. I'd like to get started ASAP but getting 40 people to level 60 all at the same time isn't going to happen. Ideally we'd all be 60 within a month and go from there. For example if the game came out on July 1st I would like to be in MC by August 1st and August 8th at the latest.
---
yep agility enchant on a 2h is what you want but it’s not something I’d spend the money on until later.
---
do you want to live deliciously?
---
Yes, need 100% on both factions.  I remember a lot of transferring mats between the main raiding guilds on each faction to get the gates opened.
---
Nah, Shadowpriest is better than Ele, IMO, but not sure what Surv is dong there, around AQ/Naxx you should go to Surv after getting an Agility cap for the 29 surv deep Lightning Reflexes build and certain Balance druid specs are also good for PvP.
---
Probably won't be playing on a PvP server, just want to play calmly &amp; do my thing, although I do not want to fall victim to boredom
---
Oldie goldie always nice to see it.
---
thats like raiding in arms spec. probably doable but disrespectful to all the other people that actually come in a raidspec.
---
Yeah... so the issue there is that retail scratches that itch sure and great. However roleplaying to that extent just isn't  World of Warcraft. It's just so not the spirit of the MMO. The spirit of WoW is seeing your bits and pieces of Iconic gear and knowing where they came from and the effort it takes to piece that all together, not to just run through the newest Retail themepark solo mode with your own RP Headcannon
---
No, not at all. You get one more talent as arcane for pve
---
Unfortunately? You must be unfortunate indeed. Best of luck dude
---
You and me both, OP.
---
I'm probably doing Druid because I want to tank primarily and heal secondarily.
---
If you're talking about exploring the world, stealth helps. Priests can solo things with Mind Control, but Druid is a lot more versatile.
---

Ow yeah its basiclly game breaking, the 60 bodypulls like ½, 1/3rd or just a big portion of the instance then you trow a granade to tag the mobs, then leave group while your 60 friend kills them, and you get full elite solo mob experiance for an amazing size pack.
---
It's a 30 minute cooldown. That's some dedication if you're using it to generate 40 extra shards per raid, or even per week.
---
Honestly it’s been 9 years so I can’t remember the specific talents anymore. I’ll have to get in and play with talent calculators again and dig around for the right gear. With Vanilla it’ll be more limited because the gear is way more under powered stat wise. So it’ll be more challenging to find off specs that can be viable. 
---
But a lot of comes down to focusing down on abilities. A good example is going down the Sub Rog tree and focusing on bleeds and get away mechanics, stacking as much attack power as possible, and then going for a jousting play style. Which is getting in, dropping your bleeds and poisons, then bailing out. 
---
If you have a good understanding of game/class mechanics you can whittle down an enemy with it. Its not flashy and its not going to generate big crits but it will do the job well. Especially on Warriors.
---
Jumper cables. 😛
---
what? you should read the talent tree again.
---
"I'm so done with this sh\*\*"

---
Holy/Disc Priest &amp; Hunter looking for..
---
* PVE
---
* NA
---
* DKP
---
* Hardcore/Semi-hardcore
---
Husband &amp; Wife team.  We have open availability.  We both raided at the highest level in Vanilla 14 years ago.  We have both either led or been officers in raiding guilds, including hardcore progression guilds, in the past.  We would be open to taking on officer roles but have no interest in starting our own guild.
---
We're looking for a guild with a mature player base that will take the game seriously when needed, but still knows how to have fun.  A guild that has both professional and ethical standards and expects its members to treat other players like human beings.
---
*Ahem* 2h Enhance.
---
"I loved healing, buffing my team mates and having a good amount of survivability, what class do you think is the best suited for my gamestyle?"
---
Paladin seems to fit this the most and, is the strongest healer support in classic wow. That being said the offensive power of a paladin is pretty unremarkable.
---
Priest on the other hand are only a little tiny bit worse in healer support category but, can get far more aggressively dominate as a shadow priest. You can also be horde as a priest. So you won't be a garbage example of a human being. I would consider that as well.
---
for lateter
---
Alright Satan....
---
But seriously I want to see this.
---
Loot council: we’re getting people to vote in class leaders + we select a few randoms each month to sit in. Part of the reason I formed the guild was because I’ve been burnt by corruption
---
Not by any reasonable definition.
---
unfortunately, this is not blizzlike at all. Arcane Missiles only have one chance to proc clearcasting, whenever it is casted (10% chance like all other spells)
---
Not entirely true. Early Phases destro is lacking the fire damage pvp gear to really be insane so there definitely will be affli locks since they’re BIS in PvE as well as PvP early on. The divide happens at later stages in vanilla
---
At the start i think every zone ended with having several quests that required killing elite mobs, and those were only possible with a group. You would always see people asking for help with those.  
---
Here were the places that had an entire section filled with elites. All are in the northern part of Eastern Kingdoms as I know those places the most, and was were I leveled my first toon before all the elites were changed.  
---
* Loch Modan - Mo'Grosh Stronghold
---
* Wetlands - Dun Modr (grim batol as well, but they were lvl 50 and you had no quests to get there)
---
* Arathi Highlands  - Stromgarde keep
---
* The Hinterlands - Jantha'Alor
---
* Western Plaguelands - Hearthglenn
---
* Eastern Plaguelands - Tyr's Hand  
---
Other zones would finish off with requiring to kill an elite enemy/enemies that were often fairly difficult to solo
---
* Badlands, Searing gorge was kill a dragon
---
* Un'goro Crater had the the T-rex
---
* STV had one at the end of each creature questline.
---
* Desolace had the Centaur Chieftains (fuck those guys and the quick spawns around them)
---
and many others
---
*  every Hunter and Shaman hitting 40  * Neat shoulders.
---
Search me on realm players, i think you're high on something tbh
---
[There's a really extensive guide over on barrenschat for specifically grinding gold as a mage](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=880)
---
lul what
---
Man my memory is terrible, I don't remember doing spell downranking in TBC. I played mostly druid back then, didn't play priest until WotlK.
---
Are dots a real strat after locks have good gear?
---
Nooooooo
---
There is a guaranteed spawn every AV so there would be a race of mage herbalists of who would get to it first, pop all trinkets just to grab it.
---
Ele is best Shaman PvP spec (by a landslide)
---
Mage goes 31 into Arcane for PvE, pretty much an Arcane spec
---
Ret pretty bad outside of leveling
---
Balance is the strongest PvP spec outside of flag running 
---
Shadow is obviously great for solo PvP
---
In pre made AB Hunters go Survival
---
All these specs are useful somewhere
---
Took me unti lvl 37 to replace it with the ravager from SM armory. Talk about worth it.
---
Ask yourself. Are you a super try hard? If not I would go priest. I always tell people. Are you 100% sure druid life is the life for you? If not play something else. Your future will be filled with regret.
---
We used to do this aswell, as Tauren Druid + Tauren Warrior in SM Cath, stunlock rotation and cd rotation. it took time but it was fun
---
Oh man, two friends and I used to have a blast 3-manning dungeons. We did them as close to level-appropriate as we could. Whenever we got slaughtered, we would think up a new strategy. It was so much fun, and really taught us how to play our classes in unique ways.
---
Consider it payback for all those times my mage got jumped in the middle of killing those nuclear-arcane-missles enchanters.
---
it was more of a meme, just to get the forms to procc. But as for damage its not good, there are so much better weapons
---
I believe they could proc off of any damage, so even hunters could make use of them.
---
No this was not a common trend. That being said maybe it should have been I have no idea what the proc rate is.
---
Verigans fist!
---
With 40 people in the raid and only like 3-4 items dropping per boss you're going to need meme specs or you'll never gear your guild. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone in the raid needs to be uber cookie cutter spec to kill the boss.
---
Well I was going to roll Horde but my partner wants alliance so maybe you guys will fit well.
---
That sounds like a reasonable way to handle the transparency aspect of lc.
---
You need rogues or mages more? I'm undecided at this point (possibly leaning to rogue as I've never got one to 60 and opening lock boxes is fun).
---
Ah yeah thats dead then lol
---
and any kind of caster/clothy looked like a hobo magician
---
good times
---
L2twist bruh.
---
You forgot to say only when they are a healer..
---
Songflower and dire maul buffs were definitely known and used back in vanilla, I used to farm whipper root tubers and I wasn't even in some sort of insane hardcore guild or anything.
---
that's the spirit brow. we used to 2 or 3-man everything. it was our hard mode :)
---
full mithrill set if not mistaken :) the grind was real
---
I wish we got the great dick of azeroth instead of heart of azeroth...
---
First ive heard of this, why is it easier for alliance if you dont mind me asking? 
---
Paladins?
---
I liked the warrior. Grinding out to 60 is faster than a mage, as you can tank to find a group for dungeons. The downtime between pulling while solo is way less with only needing to bandage which is faster than sitting and eating/drinking. With cleave and sweeping strikes you can clear groups faster. I liked arms as you only need to find 1 quality weapon, vs two 1 handers as you leveled.  
---
There is an abundance of rogues in pvp battle grounds and you are their hard counter. You have a lot of outs for most CC, and are able to close quickly with intercept and charge.   
---
The downside is that  a warrior is very gear dependent, where as a mage will start off stronger and stay fairly strong the better their gear gets.  
---
For professions if you care about pvp mining / engineering and going goblin specialty is the known best route. Otherwise I would think alchemy / herbalism as the 2nd best with being able to craft and farm your own pots.
---
&gt; Like why does it bother them so much?
---
They are 12...or 40y/o neckbeards.
---
Leveling armor* fixed that for you
---
What do you mean? Twinks can que with non twinks in bfa now. They haven't been able to since wotlk.
---
Oh I’m sure it was ! But I’m referring to Harrods Shoulder. Everyone I knew (myself included) had that in the bank from the first run they did SM at like 35-40, right around when Hunters and Shamans could start using mail. The helmet too, it was on almost every 40-45 toon of those classes
---
I had the full SM mail set on my hunter...
---
Along with Ravager
---
Man.. Private servers have warped people's perception SO BAD. Right off the bat you have what's actually a pretty hard fight compared to what you are put up against in MC, then you have vael who was nicknamed the guild killer. I also remember certain combinations of chromaggus being brutally difficult and Nef was no joke, either. My server had fewer than like 10 guilds capable of killing him, and I was on the same server as some pretty big name guilds.
---
Not at all. Melee dps proc WF too. Its so easy to accidentally windfury crit and pull threat. Windfury pulls you ahead of casters but the RNG of melee dps threat makes it way more difficult to hold aggro.
---
I don't think you've spent much time playing online games. Being told to unsub and kill yourself for something as trivial as playing the wrong spec happens regularly. It's amazing just how despicable people can be when they can hide behind the anonymity of the internet.
---
31/5/15 for warriors was incredibly popular because it allowed actual dps with the ability to easily swap to an offtank role.
---
Subpar raid dps compared to other casters.
---
Oh Jesus I forgot about Ravager
---
If you play 3 hours a day that gives you 6 opportunities to use it every day which comes out to 42 a week.
---
3 hours a day is more on the casual side when it comes to mmo.
---
Or most people are concerned with whether or not a spec is viable in PvE raid content.
---
Does the damage from flametongue weapon, windfury weapon, or frostrbrand weapon cause spell pushback when attacking someone who is casting?
---
oh, i see! i don't remember the drop this day
---
I wish I had done more of this... might intentionally run dungeons undermanned for the fun of it this time around.
---
I don't think you've been paying attention.
---
I actually spent a lot of time trying to find this book on my NE rogue...
---
So throughout the course of the game shadow dmg is your dominant PvE stat as it has insane damage potential with shadow bolts. In raids you have to learn serious restraint not to go ham and take aggro. So if you’re someone like me and you like to do both PvP and PvE then affliction is your best bet. You just run away constantly keeping yourself bubbled with voidwalker and the enemy feared. Even if you’re affliction you have amazing PvP tools like the void bubble, death coil and Shadowburn. There is also an affliction talent that can proc giving you an instant cast shadowbolt. Also there’s a talent that makes any shadowbolt crit put a debuff that allows you to do something like 10% more shadow damage until you’ve used 3 shadow abilities on the target or for 15 seconds. So you see the inherent synergy where if you can shadowbolt someone after fearing them and it crits then you can spam instants like shadowburn and death coil or an instant shadowbolt for absolutely ridiculous burst damage. You have to put effort into getting good fire damage gear which doesn’t show up until later raids for Destro to be effective. If you can get that fire gear though destro is definitely stronger
---
Gotta get those sick Raptor Strike crits
---
Getting into a raid/guild is not an issue for any class. Guild management is s pain with 40-man raids and people will always be looking for more bodies.
---
Being desired by good guilds is not an issue for any meta class—as long as you’re a strong player who shows up for raids.
---
I strongly suggest you play the class you want to play. Frost mages and Holy Priests will be in high demand at 60, so you’ll be fine either way.
---
I’m kind of amazed I do. But there weren’t very many single shoulder pads in the game though, it stood out

Not having RP-PVP servers at launch would be a mistake on Blizzard's part. There is at least enough interest for 1 RP-PVP server. If there is none at launch then it will deflate the experience for a whole community of players. Please, Blizzard!

Behold, I am ZEUS!

See but you could’ve queued as dps....

What did the “lol” macro with the moonkin icon do? I must know.

Is it possible to get class added to the site?  Think it would help searching a bit more.

Thanks again!
---
We have 4 girls that are regular raiders in my retail guild, its the only guild ive ever been in where people just treat them like nornal humans. 
---
Every other guild has one.. two or dozens of super cringey super weird dudes that cant help but to make super innapropriate comments any chance they get.
---
Frost mage ceiling is so much lower than it is in TBC / wrath. It has a similar feel to arcane mage in s5, where if you aren't spamming instants then you are doing it wrong
---
In my case, I can ask off quickly like you can. The problem is, there are very few job titles where I work, and you can't take off at the same time as someone else with same job title. July and August is packed with vacation requests already. Most of them aren't the same job title, but the longer I wait, the more likely someone else is to request time that I might want off.
---
really fking hope they dont change pathing...
---
sooooooo....

hey :)

I knew no one that did this outside of as a lulz joke/for fun.

Paladins and fear ward. In pvp paladins have access to things like blessing of salvation. Which aren't necisary obviously, you can do the content with out the massive nerf to your aggro build. How ever just being able to peel all out without thinking. Means more people with meet the skill thresh hold to do harder content. Also paladins in good gear don't go oom healing ever. 
---
In pvp, by the time you get to naxx. A paladin is finally not a "clothadin" they are full plate, mobile fortresses. They do not die to melee period. Positioning can keep the ranged away as they have to go through your warriors. So even the fact spells pen is not as decisive as you might think.
---
Couple that with the fact they can go immune to anything for 12 seconds and, while they do that. They can cast blessing of freedom on warriors while spamming cleanse to get all the bad stuff to go away. You have a recipe for a mega machine.
---
it was pretty fun, i was able to spot heal a full raid by myself with blues as a priest without any problems
---
*(Psst, that's the joke, builds are subjective and people should just do what's they want.)*
---
Fear on a target with full DoTs. I feel so evil seeing them run like a headless chicken slowly dying.
---
Many night/weekend jobs where you are mostly paid to be present. If my phone didn't get garbage service at my work, I could easily get away with using it's wifi to play WoW on a laptop all day long.
---
I may or may not have depression (glad you find that fhnny) but I can guarantee my sex life is moreorless the only thing in my life that's good. Need pussy? I had so much this week my piece is literally sore 😂
---
Enjoy losing your memory in all your weed btw.
---
&gt; considering you need 20 agility for just 1% dodge
---
isnt it 14 agi for 1% crit?
---
I totally agree,  but there’s still a distinction between the impact of Classic WoW’s gold and stupid lootboxes in other MMOs that you’re literally forced to buy to be remotely competitive.
---
The former only gives a small edge. I’m still against it, but there’s a distinction, that’s all i’m saying.
---
I want moar GM stories please (shit like this really floats my boat) ! i noticed the chuck norris joke on another post, maybe you can do a AMA?
---
Does mana Regen while in beast form? I would wager it was a cycle of burning mana, going cat, repeat.
---
&gt; An increased chance to deal double damage
---
I thought that melee crits are not 200%
---
so much arcane missile. so good.
---
I didn't think about it that way.  Especially during the summer there aren't going to be many open days.
---
It started because he'd yell when you killed the cat. Can't remember what it was but he yelled that he was gonna kill you for killing his cat, or something similar.
---
may I ask for a source link, sir?
---
It's so much more strategic and rewarding! And less loot competition. Sometimes suicidal and insane. Warlock and mage? Sure, what the hell, let's see now far we can go!
---
You can easily clear all content up to naxx with 5 of each class in your raid. 
---
Class stacking is a function of this perceived need to min max raid comp. and relatively speaking, less people play locks and druids. 
---
I hope the rabid need to min max comps doesn’t come to retail classic. Players today are so much better, with so much better access to information, that a lot of the suboptimal builds are viable for the “difficulty” of classic wow. 
---
The only real reason to get pissed about Zaney offspecs is if too few people play healers or tanks, but that’s sort of a different issue.
---
Definitely recommended! It's a lot more fun, just requires more thought and strategizing.

I played vanilla W.o.W. as 90%+ Alliance from vaguely 2006 through most of Wrath of the Lich King before quitting for years, and was elated (as many of you are) to hear the news of Classic approaching.
---
I'm 34 this year, and remember being 20-21 years old and this being my first M.M.O.R.P.G. I didn't know about slow main-hands vs. fast off-hands or why it mattered, that active weapon enchants wouldn't proc in feral forms, how much hit chance gear I needed to properly dual-wield, and much more. Through mutually painful trial and error, I was shown many tricks and much trivia over the years by those who knew more than me, and there is ever room to learn...but a year flew by before I knew it, and vanilla had transitioned into The Burning Crusade, rendering irrelevant much of the content that I never had gotten a chance to explore for myself. Aside from a couple of Zul'Gurub P.u.G.s, I never raided in vanilla, and solely focused on end-game dungeons, leveling alts/twinks, professions, general farming, and helping friends and lowbies do friend and lowbie things.

This go 'round, I am eager to reboot my old leveling/casual guild, &lt;More Scrubs than Brillo&gt;, in order to hit the ground running. Fresh servers await us, and it's the wild west of possibilities out there. To borrow a freshly relevant quote, "When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives". I feel that a leveling guild that recruits the moment the servers open will have an advantage over solo players, but a leveling guild that recruits **before the servers are even announced** is getting the jump start on getting the jump start. As a certainly older and hopefully wiser self, I wish to pay forward some of the patience, assistance, and camaraderie that was offered to me over those years.

1. Leveling: Though I won't be no-life'ing this process, I'd like us to get to 60 relatively quickly, helping one another with group quests and professions, more important than ever on a fresh server without an established economy. The first tailors (myself) making bags for those who need them, the first alchemists making potions, and so on will be crucial members of the community. I'll be main'ing a mage to tailor/enchant, create portals for those who need them, food/water for those who need them, and try to reduce downtime for the group that way. Get creative, help one another, and let's beat the opposing faction to 60 as best we can without "no-life poop-socking" it.
---
2. Gearing: Though no resentment will be held toward those who use our community as a place to grow until they are 60 and able to join a committed raiding guild, those who reach  the cap and decide to remain will ideally group up to run end-game dungeons for pre-raid best-in-slot items. Grinding instances on repeat can be tedious, and so people who know one another ought to work more cohesively and have more fun by default. The chances of wondering *if* someone can even do the job, whether or not they'll compete for your drop...I believe communication should remedy many of these concerns. I will be looking to establish a Discord once the release date is officially announced, as it appears to have replaced ye ol' Ventrilo.   :P
---
3. Raiding(?): Much of this is contingent on unforeseen variables, but, should we manage to first get many of us to 60 and then get a number of us geared from end-game instances, it would be super nifty to attempt a raid. To be a *casual* raid guild would, I think, be the mark of success for what I set out to do, here. By and large, this guild is a leveling/casual guild with the first and foremost goals being to help one another level and to gear up via instances, and even if my guild simply becomes a fly-by for a hodgepodge assortment of levels and gears as they quest/farm/dungeon/etc., I'll be happy to be here and be a part of it. Still, if we ever managed to get 30+ people in pre-B.i.S. to fill out most/all of a raid roster, I don't know why we wouldn't want to at least *try* that once a week. 
---
So, that's the bulk of the mission statement, for now. I've got a Google Drive document where I've written down the Reddit usernames of the people who have messaged me expressing interest in the guild, and I plan to send out messages when an official date is released to gauge interest, and then a second message when the servers are open/live indicating the name of the server we will all be migrating to (as well as the Discord information). Though this style of organization won't be for everyone, I am open to suggestions/questions/etc. regarding this leveling/casual style of guild with the hope of dabbling in raiding end-game, but ultimately just being a crew and having a blast.

Best of fortune in your endeavors, regardless of your path!

That’s called and alt and I’d venture a guess that most people usually have at least one. There’s no detriment to it except that you can only invest time into one character at a time.

Hold on bud, stoneform is mostly used to disengage as a rogue. A warrior or a rogue(or feral or hunter I guess) gets the jump on you, stone form, sprint, vanish and reset. Then just get a favorable encounter. It only removes those dots, and other classes will have something it doesn't remove on you. Stoneform is great, I was a dwarf rogue all classic, it's mostly used to break blind, or leave a warrior fight.
---
WOTF seems trivial until you play without it. It's like the pvp trinket is always on CD, and you're always getting feared by a target you aren't focusing. UD rogues are so classic because another reliable fear break is so important for rogues, you don't have any built in.

RAID SCHEDULE Wednesday 6:30-9:30 EST Friday 6-9 EST Sunday 6-9 EST - Show up 15mins early ready to go and we may run over on time

We're a raid first, PvP second type of community. Right now we have already formed a little of our core with our 20+ members. We have known each other for many years and some of us are family. Average age I would say is around 30yrs old. We are a mature group of people but we have open dialog.  
---
Even with our core members, we are still seeking *class* leaders, *raid* leaders, *main* tanks and help with overall management of the guild. We are very excited for the re-release of Classic WoW. No position are a lock in the early part. Everyone will have to prove their worth and skill.  
---
If this sounds like a match for you please reach out to me on discord @ #JayD9596   for more information and a link to our discord. Thanks!

I'm with you. I know technically Blizzard could get away with September based solely on the solstice/equinoxes but that would be horseshit. No one really classifies September as summer. Football has started, pumpkin spice lattes come out, Fall TV starts up, it's the beginning of Fall. A classic summer of WoW Classic would not be a release in September. Early August at the latest is a "Classic Summer".

Lol "forced"

and there will be guilds like this. just don't expect them to progress anywhere past bwl.

Waited a whole 30 sec for that SoC to proc

Then Destro locks can 1 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 people in certain situations too then?
---
They just need to find a way to block gearscore from existing in classic...

Sleep and charm aren't as common as stun and fear, but they show up pretty frequently. A hunter's Wyvern Sting is a sleep effect as are random items like Slumber Sand. A priest's mind control, warlock pet succubus' Seduction, and some engineering items are all charm effects. Priest MC is a really big one, actually. Many of us priests love to do some MC shenanigans.
---
Don't have to worry about the tank not having enough threat for the DPS.
---
If the raid is taking any kind of damage Judgment of Light does very good threat.
---
Whatchu mean? Sitting does make you regen faster!
---
Rogues' counterstrike had a very satisfying feel to it. A nice slashing sound, you knew it will always connect and it dealt damage respectable enough to feel good.
---
Yeah. I think private server raids will end up being harder because rather than undershoot they'd rather overshoot. The out of raid progression and consumables might be harder in Classic, but the bosses themselves will likely be weaker than private servers.
---
Already regressing to self- censorship in homage to Classic coming out, I see.
---
Shit i remember this video!
---
Why not a 21/0/30 build, you get everything good in holy except 5 spell crit, and all the ret dps talents. You don't get repentance, and in exchange you can actually heal. Does anybody remember, does crit healing proc vengeance?
