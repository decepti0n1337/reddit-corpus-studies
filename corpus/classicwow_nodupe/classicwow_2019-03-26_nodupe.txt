You can use the only spell you'll ever need my find friend. The blessed Dispel Magic. The GOAT if clacssic

I remember playing boomkin for alt runs in my guild on lightbringer and I would always bring savoury deviate delights to mask my boomkin form or people would laugh at me :(
---
better now than 3 months in to classic, unfortunately 
---
Speaking from the perspective of someone that cleared Naxx in a private server:
---

---
We raided for 4 hours, 2 nights a week and managed to clear the whole thing in about a month. The worst part was the time leading up to it and all of the consumable farming so that we didn't have to do it during progression. 
---
Our raid core (25ish? members) had been playing together since MC/BWL, so we all knew each other and how far we could push things. We were by no means hardcore (we label ourselves semihardcore) but would require everyone to show up full consums and Flasks (even melee in fights where damage was inevitable).
---
I'll probably make a post about it in the future - I think people overrate how much effort you should put in in order to clear Naxx. There definitely is a happy medium when it comes to time requirement and ability to doother things in your life.
---
I can't believe that I hadn't actually seen the video! Great stuff.
---
honestly if they give us a release date ill resub a few weeks before that 
---
:(
---
That numbers only based off of a reddit poll! Of course it’s going to be bigger. 
---
How many chuggas though?
---
pvp will defintely not be launched with 1st wave of content
---
so unless you want to wait 3-6 months to pvp you're going to be doing wpvp for your rank ups. 
---
They’re amazing in 5 mans tbh, a shit tonne of threat and they do insane damage. I will never forget how fast I did a zul Farrak with some prot pally On northdale, he would literally pull 10-15 mobs on his mount and we didn’t even have to wait for AoE abilities cause he gathered threat so quick.  However not so much for raids :( 
---
I also noticed that it was off in the demo.
---
I'm confident that there will be an addon that replicates the original vanilla combat text, but more likely the classic style text will be implemented by launch.
---
This is important to me for sure. Aesthetics are a big part of WoW.
---
You have 2 free hours every other day? I'd go insane... I think that might qualify as slavery.
---
I cry every time I see that video.
---
I was really excited when I first heard about the Lotro classic servers, but the more I read about it, with cash shop, and how fast people were leveling, it turned me off quite a bit, and I figured I'd just wait for WoW.  I totally get playing it though, Lotro was a really fun game through the first couple xpacs, I played from the start off and on through Rohan I think, but mostly stopped during the first xpac, I had to see Moria, and it was awesome.
---
Yeah I feel you! I wanna test run a few routes on a private server but I really wanna just hold off until retail classic!
---
Thanks!
---
As a 12 year old in vanilla I gave my characters dumb names like “Buttmustard”. I see no reason to change anything now that I’m a grown man. 
---
This. I was 11 when I made my first character, and although the account was given to my friend I believe he still exists (at least I hope so) - now almost 15 years later. Much older than I was when he was created.
---
I don’t see why they couldn’t implement OCE servers as the infrastructure is there from current live servers, and if they do I doubt they would do any cross server stuff so there’s that! I just hope there is quite a player base in OCE to keep servers full :(
---
With the rate they’ve been giving us updates, hopefully that comes soon!
---
This is correct. And once you get decent gear with mp5 flasking becomes a waste for the most part. 
---
I’d love to use my original names, but my main and my favorite alt both had 2 letter names which if they are available will be really hard to get I’m betting. 
---
&gt;That would mean ~4 million folks at least somewhat interested in Classic.
---
Two things; one, I hope that is the number we see, that would be fucking amazing; two, Blizz would be WOEFULLY unprepared for that level of interest...again, lol.
---
He got the glaives in TBC right?
---
Private servers don't count lol
---
This is my biggest concern. I’m still unsure of how long I’ll play but I’m definitely going to check it out. Sticking around will be based on how good my server is most likely. 
---
I'd be happy just to get through BWL, never progressed past MC back in the day
---
It is such a nice story around.. I like chocolate ice cream.. bla bla bla! AMAZING! VANILLA!
---
They need to up their offer!
---
From my understanding from previous private servers, this isn’t a great idea because people ranking can just farm more honor by camping flight masters while in queue 
---
Yeah I cant watch this either without getting teary eyes ;)
---
While weapon skill is incredibly good for dual-wielding melee dps like fury wars or rogues it's not nearly as good when you're just using one weapon so comparing how good it is for those classes doesn't really work. If i'm not completely mistaken warriors want weapon skill so that their off-hand can generate more rage and stuff like that. The ret paladin hit cap is much lower than the dual-wield hit cap so hit isn't nearly as valuble for paladins.
---
That said it isn't bad, it's still a solid pick but don't think that because it's bis for fury and rogue that it's automatically amazing for ret too.
---
first raid and only 1 sub 60? fake!
---
OP talks about main having skinning / lw and an alt to take tailoring / enchanting. I would counter this by saying (unless you want LW at 60) to take skinning / enchanting and the alt to take the other two. Now you can skin/farm to 60, and at 60 still have enchanting for d.e. of BoP items worth more.in ench mats then vendored. This is not directly related to 40 mount, but neither is LW unless you're going the afk / craft nightscape headband for low margin profits - and a high investment in LW.
---
Meeting a new group of people and making new friends. :)
---
Seconded 
---
There isn't much reason to resubscribe, you don't need a subscription to log into wow and your wow account is bound to the battlenet app, which also requires no subscription.
---
Don't even mention tipsout please. He never played vanilla. All of his ''guides'' are made of info he took from people who actually played the game before. 
---
And have the ability to singlehandedly fuck it up....Same as Diablo 3, not one member of the original team was in the development of it. And look how they ruined it in time. 
---
Ah fuck. Knew this day would come. Well, time to pack it in boys.
---
so what? thats how vanilla was back then
---
Not going to happen...This is a cash grab for as little work to be done as possible. People think ActiBlizz is doing this because they care lol....Wrong......As long as can "Pad" them sub numbers when it comes time for them investor meetings that's what they care about. Remember, this is a combined sub now. 
---
It was a little tongue in cheek. I believe, like you, that they will say "oops" and start with ONE RP-PVP server because, honestly, that's not that hard.
---
play another game
---
Because majority of players only care about PVE so it doesn't matter.....
---
wat
---
It’s still a low value proposition to have enchanting at 60 over several other professions. The exception being of you’re a designated enchanter for a raiding guild.
---
If not, enchanting is not going to help in getting you herbs and ore for consumables/engineering. You also lose out on any BiS craftables by locking in enchanting the entire way to 60.
---
Honestly healing is not hard to learn, so if that's what you're worried about, don't. If you don't want to be respeccing all the time there is still the elemental/resto hybrid build which is great in pve and still fine for healing raids. But you won't be min/maxed and guilds that are taking this seriously likely won't want you unless you're funny as shit. We had the worst player ever in our guild back in the day, no one gave a shit because raiding was way more fun with him around. 
---
Does anyone actually use the LocalDefense channel?
---
Hmm let’s see...
---
Main a class I haven’t mained before (so basically mage rogue or warlock... or paladin bht that’s out of the question)
---
Be an officer in a pretty chill raiding guild
---
Get AT LEAST full tier 1 armor
---
Clear BWL, and subsequent raids if my interest holds
---
Rank 9-10 in pvp
---
Have at least one thread complaining about my ganks on the server forum (or a more likely modern adaptation, have a few people in the server discord talk shit about how bad and lame I am)
---
I don’t have super lofty goals. Just some of the things that seemed so unobtainable way back when. Super stoked for it all.
---
I warrior tanked all the endgame content from vanilla to wrath. I'm planning on leveling a warrior and doing it all again.
---
Doing this
---
Mmm, crispy mystery meat surprise...  At least you can say your guild makes great leftovers?
---
For me what it boils down to at the core is the aesthetic of the character. If my class doesn't look cool in my eyes I won't enjoy it regardless of high strong I am. Which character has cooler looking sets? Maybe you're really into orc casters. Maybe you just like spamming shadow bolts over frost/fire. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses. Both warlock and mage are titans in pvp. And they're both strong in pve(mage arguable stronger). So just pick which feels cooler.
---
RP-PVP, or 2 dudes in Goldshire Inn pretending to jerk each other off. 
---
Eh .. not really. Mauradon runs are an easy gp/hr for warlocks, hunters, druids and maybe a few others. You can sell the ring drop to dps classes, or you just d.e. for shards like I said. Again, it's just an option. If you don't see the value of enchanting for disenchanting at 60, that's kinda on you.. 
---
Healers in general are pretty light on consumables with few useful consumbles actually stacking and the rest being pretty affordable with the one money sink being mana pots. There are a few way to get mana pots easier though like getting r6 for the 10s mana pots and doing tribute for the major mana and world buffs.
---
I was a soaker on a recent private server and with 100 nr i died quite often on huhu. Chugged nr pots but as a warrior it still fucking hurt. I would not say 100 is "more than enough. I guess we'll just have to see how the resistances really work when classic is released, private servers resistance is just guesses/estimates anyway.
---
About the same amount retail has, nice.
---
This for sure
---
&gt;I think we can all agree that, due to 1.12 talents and itemization, MC and BWL are gonna be shitstomps.
---
You'd be surprised how many people disagree with this.  I for one am hoping this is a change they do make, they both need to be buffed substantially.
---
i remember my casual guild who barely could get through hyjal and BT decided to go into sunwell
---
first trash pack and we were done
---
The problem is if you’re a raiding Warlock, you essentially need engineering and Tailoring (through bloodvine). Enchanting is a luxury profession and it has the increased disadvantage that you need to take it while leveling.
---
To be clear, I’m not trying to hate on enchanting — you can make any profession work.
---
Can someone find out how many times this video has been posted on this sub?
---
4 playable classes out of 9. Good game design, lol.
---
Jesus that was indeed insanely good. Like, i need to sleep in a min, not sure i can anymore. Chills, this dude needs to get hired or something.
---
That would certainly tide me over till classic release. 
---
Cuz liberals complained.
---
Remember, supporting Classic/Blizzard means you're supporting leftist censorship.
---
Stick to private servers.
---
i see!
---
i want to play melee dps and i have a really hard time deciding if i should play warrior or rogue.
---
i've been leaning towards warrior because of the simple fact that i could pretty easily make my own groups and tank 5-mans more easily. this would mean that i can be an asset to my group of friends who will play *and* also that i can exclude other melee DPS in groups i create in order to guarantee i win all the rolls when my items decide to drop.
---
rogue has great threat reducing abilities in vanish and feint which seem invaluable. especially if i decide to play horde, but i always wrote them off thinking they were worse than they apparently are in 1.12.
---
which class would you recommend?
---
If you really want to prepare work on getting thott back up.
---
I'll be needing thott when classic starts up again.
---
My live sub ended a few days ago i liquidated the account mostly to get gold for wow tokens then spent all my gold on it so i just gotta log in and press use 
---
ground zero: the place where an explosion has taken place
---
zero: a number. often annotating no value or the beginning of something.
---
you probably want to say "starting from zero" not ground zero :)
---
nice try, blizz!
---
I've been using Vanilla DB in place of Thottbot for now but I'd love the place my child self scoured in confusion back up
---
Warlocks pretty much can't lose 1v1 in wpvp in the lower levels due to Sac and especially when you get 2x sac's (sacrifice)
---
You mean like 1% of the whole RP community, which is made of mostly tourists who go to Goldshire because they think its funny and feed into it. 
---
What about 2.01? I think it was like 2 weeks. 
---
Nope, I meant ground zero, it's very commonly used to describe starting from nothing, it's even listed in the dictionary as such. Googled it for you!
---
"Definition of ground zero
---
1 : the point directly above, below, or at which a nuclear explosion occurs
---
2 : the center or origin of rapid, intense, or violent activity or change broadly : center sense 2a the party town that served as ground zero for those corporate … bashes — Rich Eisen
---
3 : the very beginning : square one
---
"
---
This had me roaring out in laughter in a public place. Here is my upvote
---
Like lots of people, I'm going to take about 1.5/2 weeks off work to hit 60.  
---
My dream has always been to get full T2 (only got full T1 in original classic on my shaman)  
---
But realistically, i'll hit max level and do world PVP and BG's - might try farm for rank 10 for cool mount!
---
The biggest challenge is keeping a roster of 40 people that can efficiently farm gold for them selves to keep up with the intense cost or consumables it costs. If your guild is very good it probably only costs a couple hundred gold a week to raid. But if your progressing and wiping you can easily spend 1000g a week, per player.
---
Was last weekend a free weekend? Where do you get notified of those?
---
A brain.
---
I honestly can't think of a better idea.
---
R13 mage armor and ironbark staff! I used the same combo. I still think the R13 mage armor is one of the coolest sets in the game.
---
i learnt something new today. tank you :)
---
Fu and Ck right ?
---
Alliance hunters get blessings and can be on a more even footing with other Dps classes. Horde hunters get no buffs (shaman will never drop agi totem) and fall significantly behind melee that get windfury. No competitive pve hunter will want to be horde
---
That's fair. Has there been a blue post where they talk about their motivations with it that supports that? I've been trying to find all of them that I can but haven't come across a development philosophy as of yet. If you have a link I'd appreciate it.
---
By yea I totally expect none of these things and was just hoping people would talk with me about it but most of this post's responses have been just hostile until defused which suggests to me I just made the post wrong. So it's all good. 
---
That demo was really just a proof of concept. Blizz will for sure fix that before release. I think they're pretty aware of how important those little details are to people
---
The only stage I'll have on that list is acceptance...well maybe anger too when I realize I played for 13 hours straight, it's time for work and I havent slept yet but I'm still willing to accept that
---
Had a great friend who was a paladin in Vanilla and BC named “Sb” don’t suppose that was you?
---
A good example at how flying negatively affects the world is if you look for videos of the aq gates opening and massive amount of players and world PvP happening, but if you look a videos of players waiting for ulduar, for example, they all just sit on the Flyers waiting to zone in.
---
Damn I played in RP PvP too back in the day and would only play on another one. 
---
Make sure you get one
---
I’m gonna level all the memespecs. Pls give me your ideas
---
I don't even understand what you mean. Must have items at 60? Must have items to aim for while leveling? Are you talking about pre-raid BiS items for every class?
---
You have this list if that's what you're looking for [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1184824748](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1184824748) 
---
Fear ward
---
There is a problem making that type of addon in the current game. Something with restrictions on the API. I looked into it recently and couldn’t find anything. 
---
I barely get that much, my friend. Not slavery, just adult life. Married with children, one of which is a toddler and needs me. Both my parents recently deceased, need to manage their assets and funeral rituals. Also have a couple houses and a car to maintain. Plus, a very demanding 11-hour workday (commute included). 
---
I was so happy to see dwarf rogue so low!
---
Week 1, they probably will at least. I have no idea how they are going to handle all of the “wow classic tourists” who just want to check it out and will quit before lvl 20.
---
Playing mage. Dont need it. cy@
---
I kinda wanna try mage; the frontloaded damage and lack of pets seems quite attractive for a RDPS. However I'm not sure on faction, let alone race.
---
Trouble is that the races I like most, Dwarf, Tauren and Orc aren't options. So what do you guys recommend? I kinda like human because they have good animations and stuff fits them well, but I'm not a big fan of their racials or facial options. Gnomes look cute and have decent animations but are so tiny I'm worried that the novelty will wear off and I'll regret not being a normal big dude. Undead seem quite comfy with their WoTF and have good animations too, but I'm not so fond of undead, and I prefer my normal horde, plus they're quite overplayed IMHO. Trolls don't seem for me, don't like animations or how armour fits them mostly. 
---
Good way to do it.  If people are no longer willing to suspend disbelief as a default stance, have to make sure they know what they are supposed to do.
---
As much as I love Vanilla... sorry, Vanilla purists, my favorite raid is, was, and always will be Karazhan.
---
Probably more to level 3 characters to 60 at once, but i might be wrong here.
---
Ventrilo, oh goood god.
---
It's okay for hunters to not need as many misc consumables since every single spare bag slot has to have ammunition in it and that's sometimes not enough.
---
I'm on this site too god damn much to get this.
---
Topping meters in a competitive guild while
---
Downing a hard boss was the best feeling I’ve ever felt before in my life. I’ll never get that feeling back. 
---
Something ive not seen mentioned is that your situation was common in vanilla, they are not like to just repeat it in classic. There will be more time to go for Naxx, as even if they make TBC classic they surely wont do the same mistake.
---
Blood, sweat and tears? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
More like "&lt;Classicers&gt; are hosting MC PUG tonight at 19:00ST. Legendaries and Mats reserved, need all whisper for invite". Its so easy to tell who actually has played "Vanilla" since TBC hit and those who hasnt. Most people are looking back at it with pink gold-tinted glasses thinking its going to be just like it was 15 years ago.
---
Its never going to be the same and anyone who has any raiding experience what so ever (which means majority of classic players) and going to find it very easy as MC/ZG a walk in the park.
---
Bring a few GFPP/GAPP and you are invited, boom.
---
No, I'm sorry but thats dumb. Player retention is a lot like the job market: you keep employee's from quitting by not being a dick. Hardcore elitist jerk guilds have by far the largest amount of ppl jumping ship. I joined the ingame skillcapped pvp guild in cata when they were recruiting 2500+ people, and my lord was it a shit show of an ever changing roster of very unhappy people. Same shit pve.
---
&gt;incentivices you to focus on killing the other team as opposed to just playing the objective 
---
So it focuses you towards not completing the bg?
---
The point I'm trying to make to you is that if you start early and amass the pots you need, then you pay less and won't have to spend so much time farming each week later on when the raid goes live.  If you wait til Naxx is live to start stockpiling Greater Frost Protection Potions, you done goofed because you'll be paying 5x the gold.  Hamsterwheel is providing costs that I assume is based on current AH prices when he was raiding Naxx.  You can cut that so much by stocking in advance.
---
Well its 1.12 so guess what you'll be getting if the logic continue "But this is how it was in 1.12 so that's final" mentality.
---
Let me know if you find anything. I'd prefer alliance but willing to try horde if I find a guild. Would need to start after 10Pm PST
---
Spirit tap and learn to efficiently kite and pull multiple mobs. 
---
Power grinding = get spirit tap
---
Standard gameplay for newbs = get wand
---
That would be a very long list. There’s many must have items every raid tier for every spec. 
---
I kept waiting for the bit where you hunted noobs lol
---
I used to play on Defias Brotherhood in vanilla back in the days of Red / Burning Dawn and the Alliance Watch. I remember those days fondly! 
---
Pros: classic good
---
Cons: not released yet
---
You can undelete characters yourself these days. If they were over 55 they should never be removed from Blizzard's servers.
---
Also sometimes creating a new character can force a refresh of the character list and they can reappear that way.
---
This guy Priests 
---
YEAH!
---
That and soulshard suck, if you do any sort of serious pvp spellstones/healthstones/sburn/demon sac etc all just chew up your soulshards and they are sort of hard to get in bgs
---
I didn't REALLY start playing until early wrath but AEsbiorn was that guy to me
---
Sitting in Org with his tier sets, and later Shadowmourne with all 3 AGI sockets as a Ret Pally. The disrespect.
---
Melting C'thun's face as a warlock
---
I know most people wouldn't like it but I have such fond memories of going to the entrance of WSG to que and dueling people while waiting for it to pop.
---
I thought they were doing 3 different subs. Has this changed? 
---
What a horrible suggestion. Premades would sit in one WSG for straight up hours. 
---
I did the exact same thing, a lot of my names come from old gaming friends who no longer play
---
Dreamless come to our discord  https://discord.gg/SsKH6rX 
---
Does it have to be up to date or any old account will do?
---
If you come prepared, as in you bought nightfall and have the correct spec then you should be able to find a guild. But be prepared to not get much if any gear because they don’t want to give you the rogue/warrior gear who are both top dps. 
---
Also if you have a lot of gold sitting on retail that you never plan on using it may be worth it to sub for a month soon and just buy a bunch of Sub tokens before the price ultimately spikes when Classic launches.
---
Plus the tiger. I never saw it drop, but just because the possibility was there...😍
---
The people on this sub are an insignificant fraction of the playerbase.
---
Quite the demand there OP.  
---
Might you do your own research?  
---
Honestly I'm only expecting about 500k-1million subscribers in the first month, which frankly would be incredible for a MMO re-release from 15 years ago. 
---
It's going to be exciting regardless, whether it is 10k people or 10million! 
---
Na you’re wrong. On private servers even casual guilds ask you to come fully consumed because it’s a small chore but helps with progression immensely. 
---
I think you’re in for a big reality for check when Classic releases and you won’t have a choice but to adapt and play along. Unless you don’t mind being guildness and playing the game solo. In that case you might as well stick with BFA. 
---
In todays industry, i would not even call them shortcomings. Everythings a live service, a micro transaction riddled roller coaster, or a bloody esport. Give me the a-symmetrical unbalanced chaos, so long as you keep it as engaging and immersive as it was (private servers manage it, surely blizz can 2, even with the piss poor decision to go for such a late patch).
---
That's actually a pretty good idea. So maybe buy my sub 15 days before hand? Should be enough time...
---
I preordered reforged, and on the reforged page on the launcher it says, and I quote "Warcraft III: Reforged is expected to come out 12/31/2019." So I would venture that no, the delay of information, likely has nothing to do with reforged's release, since classic is confirmed to come out before reforged.
---
It shouldn't. Play what you enjoy and if you decide to roll a popular class put in the work to be a good player. 
---
\&gt;dumb names
---
\&gt;"Buttmustard"
---
pick one
---
All classes bring 10 different consumables. I guess melee have it somewhat cheap because they don’t have to bring a flask. 
---
I played a shitton of retail and I was never in a guild that didn't expect you to come prepared for raids. No one was expected to bring a flask (losing it on death made it a big pointless waste most of the time) but you were absolutely expected to come with potions, food, enchants, etc. People were noobs and definitely didn't do the insane min/max every single conceivable buff/consumable thing, but saying that people didn't bother at all isn't true either.
---
Making new friends
---
I thought Reforged was slated for Q4? I think Classic is coming first.
---
That will always be my favorite!!
---
Retail = Every class does everything, must have balanced and even playing field (not that it does, least of all at the moment)
---
Vanilla = An actual MMO-RPG (retail is neither, hasn't been for years and years - its a solo player Q hub and action game), is about class fantasy and immersion, not 13 year olds showing off l33t skills. 
---
There will be classes stronger than others. There will be hard counters that you will never be able to beat regardless of skill. That is completely as it should be, this is about a World, not an esport.
---
I support the rppvp realm type, though not the realm type for me.
---
that being said we have to keep in mind too we don't know how many servers they plan to release at launch of classic.. original wow released with 40 servers I read somewhere (I didn't count back in the day) then got overwhelmed and had to open more.
---
so will they do 40 again, same server population caps? other things we don't know.
---
then there is the cost of running the server if they aren't doing connected cloud servers with sharding as a long term goal. maybe they only have budgeted X number of servers overall due to cost.. then reevaluate once they get internal numbers.  and based on numbers they already have, they will open pve and PVP realms and the  a couple of rp pve.
---
there is no difference though between PVP and rp PVP other than things like naming rules, and the like. probably have a higher gm cost associate with an rp realm on a per player basis due to that so they may be limiting it.
---
all that being said they are Blizzard and converting an rppve to rppvp wouldn't kill them. 
---
He was hired and did some work on the bfa cinematic, the opening camera over battlefield has his style written all over it. But he decided not to continue working for blizzard. 
---
Yeah as long as you keep a sevond set of gear to heal you will be fine in dungeons as any spec.
---
The pro and the con is there are no safety nets. What ruined retail is the massive convenience everywhere, especially with cross-server LFG options. Depending on population health, the lack of convenience could end up ruining Classic — it’s certainly my biggest fear for the game. 
---
The best solution is to scrap the whole cancerous right-click report system and go back to good old /ignore and tickets.
---
I can smell the auto-squelch abuse from million miles away. 
---
been playing since vanilla and still play in bfa. I have used the same set of names for characters and alts on different servers over the years. so I've already decided on what names which race/class combos I'm going to take.  and I plan to first thing reserve like 8 names, even if a toon sits at level 1 for 2 years.. I'll get to them eventually.. 
---
Ahh the best damn thing was getting on top of stormwind bank, MC'ing people so they'd fight and die to their own guards, then having some mages jump down and sapper aoe bomb the crowd that would inevitably gather to see what was up. Fking corpse run was long tho
---
i'm not subscribed and i can see all of my characters + choose from a list of them when you go on the official site to choose a character to post on. if it helps at all you can restore characters from the ingame select screen now (tho there's a month period in between restores) so they aren't gone forever, but that really sucks man, i'm sorry
---
you only need to resubscribe to play, classic and modern are combined under one sub
---

I remember back when this sub was around 20kish /cry, they grow up so fast 
---
I did find them. I just had to repopulate them on the server list by joining the servers I used to play on. Until I did that, it was blank. Thankfully, I remembered the 3 servers I was on...
---
3 different subs? This is the first I've heard of that. [It's going to be a shared sub](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/wow-classic-free-with-subscription/).
---
I can't raid dps the class is unplayable reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Sure you are somewhat right but also private servers are just mechanically wrong in ALOT of instances because the devs who made private servers didnt and still dont have the correct information or things have been changed like rallying cry of the dragonslayer having a 2hr internal CD or 10-12hr CD(whatever it was) on war-chiefs blessing.
---
That's fair enough, I'd love to play a version of the game without store mounts or 20 dollar vanity pets everywhere. 
---
Out of curiosity though, what's wrong with their decision to go with 1.12? What should they have done instead and why?
---
&gt;can’t wait to see you all in the world... of warcraft. 
---
lmao.
---
Yep my guess would be a month and a half - two months after 8.2 drops. That should put us around July. 
---
Huh i see, thank you for sharing. Can't really blame him, any1 worth his salt seems to be jumping off that burning boat. Feels like blizzard is more a maggoty corpse that some grave keeper (activision) is charging money to see.
---
It's no worse than soloing stuff as a holy paladin or resto shaman.
---
I only had that when taking screenshots.
---
Depends on your server. If they're all try hards you need to do more but I remember in vanilla on Doomhammer the rank 14 guys were putting in more than 14 hours a day.
---
&gt;There will be classes stronger than others. There will be hard counters that you will never be able to beat regardless of skill. That is completely as it should be, this is about a World, not an esport
---
To be clear I'm not against any of this, but comparing a dps war, to a moonkin isn't one class is better, it's one spec is absurdly op, and one spec is straight up broken.  
---
The power differences between the best in vanilla, and the worst are massive, a big part of that is that some classes were not revamped until TBC, while other classes were.  And some classes were left OP in 1.12 (warriors) because TBC was right around the corner.
---
I don't think you can hand wave a lot of this stuff, I believe this is going to be a huge issue once classic is released.
---
I'm not saying they need to fix it, but I do think it's something they need to talk about.  I promise a few months after release it's going to start and it's going to be VERY loud, and people are going to make a very valid argument that it is not fair to pay a sub fee to play a broken class, that Blizz has already fixed.
---
I'd also like to point out that you can have relative balance without losing class fantasy, TBC did this wonderfully, better in most cases than Vanilla did.  It's important to understand the weak or broken classes were not that way out of design, but because they were under developed, or unfinished.
---
Haha
---
Why did hunters dismiss their pets and why did they stop? 
---
I would also add DefTalk to that list, it's by Defcamp, Melderon and Kargoz
---
Not a popular opinion, but still to date my favorite 2 weeks of wow. Nobody had anything figured out, had to make deep sacrifices to make meaningful talent choices, so many specs brought into a new light.
---
We already know how they're going to handle it, sharding. 
---
literally no reason to sub until classic is out. this post makes no sense. some people just want to pay early to see their old characters I guess. 
---
Don't worry, you can level really well as a hunter. lmao
---
I think its because every time Blizz gives us even the slightest spoonful of info, we upvote it to the front page, and they've been doing that more recently lately. 
---
i got mine stolen by a healer pally once xd
---
why would logging in 3 days before classic is released be needed? Can’t figure out any reason this would be necessary. If you’re wanting to look at old characters I have no idea why you couldn’t wait until after release. well all be starting fresh anyway. 
---
Makes me cry as well
---
Why?
---
May I ask what the name of your mt was? 
---
And you did it in the course of trying to correct someone unnecessarily while being completely wrong! Congrats you’re an asshole!
---
Hunters are very good at everything besides pve dps which they're fine at. If that's your shining example of unplayable consider me unimpressed. 
---
There will be a ton of new subs once it goes live and there will be a lot of younger people who weren’t old enough to play vanilla who will give classic a try since they are already subbed to retail
---
Are you sure? I don't think he was ever hired or worked with Blizzard.
---
Considering they were making changes to lampposts to make them "more vanilla" I guarantee this is on their radar. 
---
Have you thought about using simulationcraft instead?
---
https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/StartersGuide
---
I am in the same boat as the OP and am planning on rolling at HotW Druid to heal/tank 5 mans and PVP. I'll be working towards this list of gear. You wouldn't happen to have a similar list for resto gear?
---
Hyped for deadmines and WC at low levels and scarlet monastery in the 30s. At 60, im excited for world pvp
---
With 3 people, you can do dungeons by yourself that are a few levels below you. Itself useful for farming gold.
---
You can however, form any group for anything almost instantly. Especially with a warrior priest combo. You've got the tank and healer spots, now you just need to fill DPS.
---
Finally, it also helps not getting ganked. If the opening few weeks are anything like the 10k private server launches, there are going to be quite a few rogues looking to get their rocks off. Going up against a group of 3 will make them think twice.
---
As for the downside, collection quests suck even more to complete. You need to do a lot of grinding, but luckily that's easy with no downtime. You shred through mobs, and the gameplay can be very engaging depending on how many actions per minute you are pulling off. Or, you can just auto shoot every job 1by1, just depends on your play style and how quickly you want to level.
---
Now you just gotta figure out how to get Monday to blur into Friday! Let me know once you do!
---
I always thought banks were a scam. Like, whats the point of all the weird novelty and vanity items I own if they just sit in my bank? And I never had enough currency to stockpile things like crafting mats or pots. 
---
As a result I carried literally everything I owned in my bags from 1-60 then all the way to 80 in Wrath which is when I quit. Think I stepped in the bank like twice. 
---
Precisely. That's why I am doing 3 different classes that I want to have level 60s of that I never had. That would be priest, warrior, and probably mage.
---
My goal is to eventually transfer them all to the same account, and choose who Inreally want to be my main.
---
The idea of a 3 minute mage is nice, but so is an unstoppable warrior.
---
Finally someone got my joke. 
---
Good. We do not need every spec to be competitively viable in dmg. Bring a moonkin for the spell caster buff and the combat ress, or completely refuse to take them. Let it be so! Once you do, it'll reveal itself for the good decision it is.
---
Same case for all your power difference arguments. Furthermore, its not like this is not the case in retail - i have not played pve in many years to be fair, but in BFA there are a ton of dead specs and god specs in pvp. I must have played several thousand of games before i saw a MM hunter (and that in spite of being a very popular spec in legion). Disagree wholeheartedly on the TBC part as well, i remember 2v1'ing in arena at 2k+ rating when my healer didnt get in the match. Fmage was utter godspec and nothing compared to RMP bk then. Instead of pretending to be some esport competitive game, as it has done and failed to be for so many years now, let wow be an MMO-RPG again.
---
Classes were weaker than others because they did not all have the same bloody tools, instead they all had their own niche in which they shined, and they do not all bloody need to have the ''best 1v1 godtier spec'' niche nor the ''top dps meter dmg l33t'' niche, because its not a niche at that point, its redundant, uninspired and boring.
---
They should talk about it, and they should know and acknowledge it as the strength it is, not the copy paste weakness that has infested retail.
---
I mean if your account got hacked you could just create a new account and sub for classic. psure you wont need newest xpacks for it. could be wrong though
---
Huh. Would love to know the outcome of the testing on [Redacted]
---
my gamer tags been babydill for over 20 years. can't change it now! :)
---
#RHEEEEEE!
---
To be fair though, they also said that they were probably going to leave the mailbox like it was in the demo (where you could mail multiple things at once instead of one at a time) which isn't very nitpicky like the lampost thing was. Contradicting pieces of evidence, i don't know if they are going to or not 
---
Back then Hunters often didn't bother using their pet or just used a Wolf standing there howling, because they didn't actively control it or revive it, thinking it was a waste of time.
---
Now people got better with Hunters and realized that if you actively control it you will deal a significant amount of additional damage.
---
If Blizzard doesn't provide the server type, then the community needs to do is best to make known the preferable servers for that play style
---
True, but mail is definitely more complex to deal with than client-side font aesthetics and lamp graphics. 
---
/silly 
---
And world buffs are not available for the first month of each raid release because they ruin progression.
---
Also the CD on the buffs is intentionally removed because it is healthier for the game for people just to get their buffs instead of sniping it for several hours like what used to happen when thrall's had it's blizzlike 6 hour cd.
---
Planning to main a female Tauren Druid, with my “end game” goals being pvp black kodo mount, full tier 2, raid resto and then gear out a full feral spec as well for a ton of world pvp fun.
---
I fell in love with druids before launch but quit the class at level 20ish before rerolling mage which I raided through T2... really enjoyed the mage but I’ve always regretted giving up on druids... I cannot wait to correct my mistake with the launch of classic.
---
Generally, if I need money as a Prot Warrior, I’ll do dungeons. If I need to grind rep, I’ll try and do it with guildies. But, you can actually tank really well 0/31/20, and use those points in Fory to be pretty capable solo. That’s the spec I’d play if I wanted to solo as Prot. However, I’m going to level a hunter alt so I can run DM: Trib solo. Hopefully I can get both characters to 60 by the time DM is phased in.

i'm really glad!!!
---
So you are saying that investing in things saves you money? Wow I didn't know! 
---
We all know that investments saves you money, that is really besides the point.
---
I really enjoyed the 41 point talents at 60. Devastation was awesome, but I stupidly rolled a fresh Dranei when TBC launches. 
---
I recommend trying other games while you still can. If you're like me, you will have zero interest in other games once classic hits. Some of my favorites are Smash (melee or ultimate), fortnite/apex (haHAA), Halo MCC (not on pc yet but soon to be!), Super Mario Odyssey, TLoZ: Breath of the Wild, etc. 
---
I want WC3 just for the custom tower defense maps people make :P
---
Just look at pserver data. It's the closest thing we have to what 1.12 classic will be.
---
While I appreciate the hard-work that went into that, and similar things such as askmrrobot back in the day (dunno if that's still a thing); that doesn't have anything classic-related implemented. Also it is not what I wanted even if it had a classic version because it doesn't cover theorycrafting as a whole. There isn't just 1 way to play hunter, and there is way more gear choices/buffs in classic than any other version of the game. I think its really cool and its the first I saw of it, but just looking through it it's not what I would have wanted
---
Reforged was never early 2019, just some time in 2019. It will release in late 2019.
---
Oh god I'd give anything for more games that aren't purposefully diluted to accommodate for better moneytization. Its so abhorrent how good gameplay is not so much as a top 3 concern these days, industry took a giant shit in a lootbox then crawled inside it.
---
So far as i recall, by the time 1.12 rolled out, we were very late in vanilla. In vanilla, class revamps started near the end, and so in 1.12 i believe some classes had their revamp while others did not. So far as i recall, any class that got a revamp often saw a huge spike in strength, so that's like to cause issues - some classes didn't see a revamp till TBC mind you.
---
Aside from that, it just makes so little sense: Releasing raid tiers and difficulties in historical order, but doing the class-scaling at the end from the beginning. To be sure it could work out just fine with careful planning and thorough understanding, but its more likely imo to mess things up extensively. That and i am so saddened to hear we're merely getting retail AV with a nostalgia plugin.
---
It boils down to this i think: Everyone thinks they want everything to be the same. Every class to have the same tools, every BG to be the same (Imo AV shines when it is a PvPvE BG, not a PvE zergfest, and as such it needs NPCs that stop zergs). Vanilla is an amazing experience precisely because it doesn't give a fk about equal playing field, instead it hands you a truly unique class with roles only it can do. It is not about having a supporting esport scene for longevity, and it refuses to be a redundant copy paste on every class. We need to understand this and demand it to remain so, or we are utter fools who idd do not know what we want.
---
I see what you mean, my first reaction is to pick a different realm but idk, would be nice to have a realm full of people who know what's up and will stick with the game. 
---
Shit happens. There was a nuance to the english langauge of which i wasnt aware. No need to be an ass about it :)
---
Speculation says pax east might drop release date! This weekend!
---
Is your 1-40 route private or posted somewhere
---
I've never emptied my quiver even in a 5 hour raid. Hunters use slow weapons
---
Pretty much every major Twitch streamer was a WoW nerd at one point. Classic is going to absolutely dominate the platform for a week at least. Wouldn't be surprise if it breaks #1 spot and passes Fornite/League for at least a couple hours. 
---
Student, summer vacation most of the times I hit it. I haven't done it since before &lt;the big server that got shutdown launched&gt; I'm in investments now, if I go again I'll probably do the more casual / longer approach until the end then just take off to to to final bit.
---
Cosmetic and Ui stuff is a simple issue:
---
Is everything completely authentically available? As in, if i click classic mode, is it truly classic?
---
Okey then, good! Now add whatever else you damn well please as optional stuff.
---
Hunter is actually pretty cheap if you don't tryhard. But if you do tryhard it's pretty expensive hard buffing you pet all the time.
---
As for other classes, healers are definitely your pick. Paladin is actually retardedly mana efficient so you can even save money on pots.
---
One server I did it on it was 100k HKs. Another was probably like 8hr/day, 12 weeks (small server tho, few hundred peaks). I haven't done it since before &lt;big server that launched and got shutdown&gt; launched. Supposedly 18hr/day / 12 weeks, 10hr day / 16 weeks or something like that is what people like Monkeynews say it's like on all the recent servers.
---
If it gets too bad we will probably see merges. 
---

warrior 18.1%

shaman 14.6% 
---
I doubt it will release before classic. if it releases this year then it's already GJ blizz.
---
If you want to raid, dont go ret
---
This is a 50 IQ question. So my answer will also be 50 IQ. 
---
Internet
---
Afaik they never confirmed that it would be locked. I'm pretty sure if vanilla is successful, they'll be releasing TBC eventually. They might keep a few servers on vanilla with free transfers or something like that.
---
Why would you waste bandwidth on that garbage. I'm saving mine for more switch games
---
But then they were like... “Don’t you guys have phones?!” Ruined that BlizzCon for me.
---
I will not resub until they give us a release date and then it will be 1 day before launch. I'm not giving Blizzard money for nothing and im not resubbing a month early to watch it go to waste because I won't play the trash that is current wow.
---
I haven't unsubbed from retail yet for a higher chance of beta access 
---
Hey at least you can buy ammo quickly. Warlocks have the same bag issue, except it takes 30 minutes to farm the shards after a raid.
---
It depends if your intent is to speed level or not. They are trying to get to 60 as quickly as possible, and spending time to level weapon skill could cost them an hour here or there overall. If that's not your goal, I really wouldn't worry about it.
---
If you're levelling casually I would recommend trying to keep a few different weapon skills at least partially levelled, that way you won't have to level them from 0 if you get a new one that is significantly better than your current. Also, having some int pieces or an int set and a fast version of that weapon can be really useful. For example, if you got a 3.6 speed 2h mace it might be worth trying to find a 2.2 speed one off the AH to help boost it quicker.
---
Once again, this all depends on your priorities.

---
I think this is a really good gear spreadsheet for druids. Taladril the author really knows the class
---
This is all assuming taking things very seriously and trying to be the best you can, tiers don't mean the class is better than any below it only that they have more optimal specs and is sort of slanted toward pvp but pve is taken into account. None of them need to be deleted from existence because you can always have fun with them in random BG's.
---
I prefer to go by viable specs instead of just calling them by a tree name though
---
Top tier
---
Warrior (all 3 specs are pretty much the best at what they do only con is they aren't super at solo pvp)(arms pvp,fury pve, prot pve) gets a slight edge for being able to fill 2 different roles while still being great dps
---
Mage (tons of viable specs, good at all stages of the game in pve and pvp great group fighter, not bad solo)(AP/frost,WC,pvefire,pvpfrost,ele,pom/pyro)
---
Lock (Several viable specs, start sort of weak but finish strong, strong group or solo fighter depending on spec)(Sm/ruin,DS/ruin,NF/SL,SB/SL,SF/Con)
---
Rogue (Couple of viable specs, Start very strong, ends still pretty strong, not a group fighter)(com/sword, com/dag,hemo,impsprint)
---
High tier
---
Hunter (Starts very strong, gets progressively weaker every raid tier, they aren't pvp powerhouses but they stay pretty strong because of their insane range and mobility and are a must include with viper sting for pvp and tranq shot for pve)(Marks/surv,BM,Bm/marks)
---
Priest (has a couple viable specs, not gonna win any awards as a pve shadow priest but you aren't laughed out of the raid either like a moonkin) (Holy,Disc,shadow,tri)
---
Medium tier (again these aren't weak classes but they only have a few specs that really shine)
---
Pally (really only has holy spec to be competitive at anything, but its extremely strong at that one spec at all aspects of the game) (Holy)
---
Shaman (Resto for raiding, ele for pvp when geared (which takes a long time), you might find a group that lets you swing nightfall, enh is fun for montages but pretty bad otherwise)(resto,30/0/21)
---
Druid tier
---
What to say about druid... Cat Durid is 4 fite? They are viable at quite a few things, placing them is nearly impossible though because of how insane trying to play one optimally is, best flag runners by far, can be decent dps if you go max tryhard with consumables (and are alliance for blessings) can tank, can heal. Hell if you can get naxx level gear you can even be a pvp boss as moonkin (of course trying to get that level of gear is an uphill battle) I only put these guys in their own tier because its very much like playing the game on hard mode in many ways.
---
I can all but guarantee you will be REQUIRED to have the latest expansion pack. People are going to be pissed when they find out that they can't just spend $15 and start playing.
---
I'm surprised you didnt lead with "before this gets downvoted into oblivion hear me out"
---
Honestly what the fuck is this lol
---
I mean, I know its probably frowned upon, but isn't kinda inevitable to happen at this point?
---
&gt;One being consumables are going to be harder to get compared to private servers. Private servers have dynamic respawns meaning herbs and other materials spawn a lot faster than they did in retail vanilla.
---
  
---
While true, the classic servers are likely to have more authentic population caps closer to what those respawns were designed for. 
---
Defcamp?
---
Skinning is always good for extra money. If you can find a place to grind beasts and skin them for a level or so, that will give you a ton of cash. Grinding as a hunter could possibly be better xp/hr than questing in the 30-40 bracket anyway, depending where you go. 
---
If you decide to grind for some gold, the yetis around alterac mountain/hillsbrad are pretty good as you can get large amounts of cloth and skins.
---
I totally didn't find out about the free sub weekend until... Today... lol. It's fine, I still gotta find my original box and junk for it anyways because email addy and such is completely different. I'll likely have to jump through a few hoops with Blizzard just to get it activated and such. I haven't even logged it in since before [battle.net](https://battle.net) came in. I just started a diff account when I returned during Cata. And i'm still trying to find people from my Vanilla raiding guild. The Vaniilla listing site isn't showing any of them that I don't already have as friends on FB. :/
---
The gear isnt there for them on private servers.  Lets see what they get for gear on classic launch.  If they can stack plate spell power early they can tank pretty well if you grab a ret paladinand devote seal of crusader and sanctity aura.  On top of that you need all consumables (spl dmg melee dmg and tank buffs) 
---
The question being are they viable is a good question.  This is vanilla 2nd time around.  Its time to do non optimal spec.  Its harder and more enjoyable.
---
Being a tank and being a paladin you have to ne an asshole.  I know this sounds rude but you just need to kick people out of the group and assert dominance early.  You can screw up at all or someone in your group will flame you.  You will get occasional fury warriors going d stance and taunting off you and saying you lost aggro. 
---
This is the best advice I think
---
Howdy
---
We've worked on a 1-60 guide for alliance the last couple of years, and it will be available before classic launch. I think we'll have a 1-19 early preview out very soon too.
---
I got the Dope farm spot for you homie. Hit up the burning blade cave in northeast durotar. Just stay there all day, really good place to find black lotus too. GL &lt;3333
---
I’d love to see the meme specs added to this. Yes, no matter how good the gear is, they aren’t as strong as a pure DPS. People are still going to play ret, boomkin, etc, so they may as well have the BiS so they can have a wishlist and minmax themselves.
---
The main reason why there is a large demand for warlocks on alliance is they (usually) don't fare as well in pvp compared to the horde counterparts, like orc (UD rogues are a hard counter to alliance warlocks, where there is no UD for orcs to fight against, and the orc stun resist racial helps them a lot vs rogues).
---
That being said, there is a high demand for warlocks ally side. If you decide to raid you shouldnt have much problem there. For raiding, tailoring is very helpful as once ZG comes out you can get the bloodvine set (which has +hit, VERY necessary for warlocks). While it isnt NECESSARY to have tailoring to wear the pieces, you need tailoring to benefit from the set bonus (2% crit i think - also very good).
---
You can pvp and pve as the same spec, namely SM/ruin, but that's about it. And about skinning: many players don't even end up AHing it during a big levelling rush on a new server, they just vendor it to save the hassle.
---
Last note: I've raided as a warlock before (horde side) and doing it alliance would be much, much better. Warlocks have threat problems to begin with, so having salvation is very nice.
---
Iirc he was offered, but didn't take it. He went to blur instead, I think it was?
---
It sounds like to me warrior is more up your alley. 
---
All I'll say is that if you are leaning more toward a min/max concern, then horde is slightly, every so tiny more preferable for warrior because of a +hit trinket. Alliance, conversely, for rogue, because humans get the bonus to sword skill, which, combined with the combat rogue sword spec, it works super well.
---
After seeing how long Apex Legends stayed in the top spot, I wouldn’t be surprised if Classic holds the same attention, if not longer
---
But what about soulbound gear? Can’t mail that to an alt. 
---
Retail can still be fun but you have to approach it like it’s a completely different game (which it is). I wouldn’t pay full price for BFA though
---
I personally wouldn't recommend running to a different starting zone as none of them are really difficult - the exception to that being if one starting zone is extremely full and the other isn't for some reason. However, it is still unknown if there will be sharding in the starting zones when classic first launches.
---
There is also a huge time difference going from the UD starting area to orc/troll than tauren to UD, so that is something to consider. Most the alliance ones are a long run away from one another.
---
The secondary zones you will probably want to visit more than the one next to your starting area, as getting enough xp from one zone generally doesn't happen in vanilla.
---
Really enjoyed the episode, made my time at work fly by. I think you made a really good point: How much could it possibly cost for blizzard to simply have a single rpPvP server....as far as I can tell it’s exactly the same as a regular pvp server besides a few rules regarding names/player actions. The only reason I could think of is that blizzard doesn’t plan on having many classic servers (think less than 10), and so having even a single rPPvP server that MIGHT have a low population would overcrowd the rest of them. I’m really hoping they are that’s not the case though. Maybe we will get more info in the near future
---
This! Also it requires six points to unlock it!

Wonderful. I've been searching for guides and all I could find was a basic one, and I've been waiting for Joana to put out an alliance guide. If you are unable to post the guide here in a reply, feel free to DM me (if you have a site, otherwise I'll just keep looking and I'm sure I'll find it). Thanks in advance for all the hard work yall are doing.
---
It depends what you mean by competitive. Ret can be pretty good in 1v1s due to their survivability, but when it comes to organized BGs and pushing ranking you are MUCH better off going holy. I don't see any reason for any decent premade to take a ret pally.
---
That being said, just play what you enjoy. If you are set on playing ret, I'm sure you could do fine in BGs and you could probably find a premade group to play with - but I wouldn't expect to get into a bracket 1 or 2 premade.
---
That place and the elite Nagas in Azshara were my go to farming.  I liked solo one elite at a time since I played a shadow priest and usually didn’t have the mana or CC to do make more than one at a time efficient.
---
It was never that, that was just the most popular theory
---
I’m wondering when the beta is coming out, want to make sure all the kinks are out. 
---
Yeah, let us know how it goes, I’d be curious if any of those “non-traditional” leveling routes really do make a large difference 
---
Similar boat except mine was a marriage that she got bored with.  My new PC is my divorce present to myself, now I need Classic WoW to ice this cake.

Hi, /u/XmasEarring
---
So more or less 2 progression nights with an "unofficial official" 3rd off night for older raids?
---
Also thanks for the reply! It's good to know Naxx can be possible with a not too crazy raid week. 
---
Just don't let your health slip man, get back at that chick by bettering yourself also while playing woe
---
depends whether you wanna pve or pvp, or whether you wanna minmax or just play what you enjoy.
---
trolls and gnomes are fantastic for pve : bezerking and expansive mind are good.
---
humie/ud for pvp or humie if you want the rep grind to be easier. remember every race/spec is viable if not necessarily optimal. don't sweat it, it won't preclude you from a raid spot or premade spot
---
That makes sense! Thanks for the info

I feel your pain. Got one stolen two days ago by a ret pally who said he was gonna go prot. As a combat rogue who did almost half the damage in the group I wasn’t too thrilled...
---
Tbc requires flying. They shouldn't have added it, but the expansion and zones were designed for flying.
---
Just play a normal pvp server and be an RP dork on there.
---
Shit man I'm right there with you, got dumped not long ago and what keep me alive is the desire to see a few movies and shows to come and play classic wow.
---
I feel so much pity when I look at the retail WoW subreddit. Posts about extremely boring gameplay get buried under NEW T-MOG UPDATE news or posts about some new fucking race. Why is the remaining retail crowd excited over trivial shit when the actual game is a boring, dull mess? I don’t get it. I couldn’t continue my sub when all we got were new wavefronts/islands while gameplay fell to the wayside
---
I have my own plan that involves starting as human and running to dwarf starting zone while collecting zone discovery exp. But after that would be cool to know of other things to do to get past crowded areas.
---
Exactly, they would have to change a lot of the locations of things to have it be without flying, which would open up a whole can of worms, especially amongst the nochangers 
---
Classic TBC
---
#YesChanges
---
I want to get tier 3 mage gear I think. Undead with max enchanting and tailoring. Maybe a hunter alt.
---
Except they specifically said you only need the sub...
---
Make it an RP thing.
---
&gt;  Kael'thas has increased air density - making flying mounts useless. Tempest Keep is now unreachable. 
---
It just kills me, without flying TBC really could be the most optimal version of wow... 
---
I hope you're wrong.... and its way more than 4million! 
---
:)
---
I've counted, and it's not enough.
---
I'd totally be willing to bet they have at least ONE RP-Pvp server. I just can't see them for instance doing one for oceanic servers.
---
Yeah i disagree somewhat. Outlands flight was just fine. Was still expensive as hell and took effort to get epic flying speed and didnt feel out of place. Where they went wrong is adding flight to the main continents 
---
I cannot wait to get into some awesome world pvp and being a sneaky jerk rogue to as many alliance as possible! *evil grin*
---
I'm already dead. And when Classic is released, I'll wake up dead.
---
How much of this is because your realm community doesn’t matter as much because of xrealm?  I’m not being snarky, it’s an honest question, I haven’t played since Cata and I can only compete dungeon runs in that era to my experiences in vanilla. Anecdotally I remember WotLK and Cata as having much quieter runs.
---
Different blizzcons
---
Yes changes
---
Remove flying and rework areas as needed. 
---
I think we have a good chance to just go a different route, but’s that’s IMO.
---
ya'll from csm by chance?
---
Play other games while you still can. Just discovered Falllout 2. 
---
Would require like three zones to be totally redesigned 
---
On or before
---
Mine in vanilla were wayyyy different.. the mind of a 13 year old was interesting. 
---
My warlocks name was “turtleballs”
---
My druids name was “ipeerainbows”
---
&gt;Does TBC really require flying?
---
Flying was awesome in TBC. Made things interesting with no attunement for some dungeons, but needing flying to zone in. A new tier of mounts to work towards.
---
&gt; It destroys wpvp, natural player interaction in the world, and immersion
---
WPVP is a small part of a small part of the game. There are many people who have literally never engaged in it, myself included. Where's the line, where does the joy for X wpvp players outweight the joy for Y players who enjoy a new aspect of exploration?
---
IME natural player interaction ends at 40. Buffing passersby, /wave, etc. all go away once you're mounted. I'd wager 95% of players aren't going to dismount to /wave or buff a random player post 40. So should we move to no mounts at all for this?
---
Immersion. There are trained gryphons flying from point A to B since level 1. Are we to assume they're just as dumb as carrier pigeons and can't be trained as well as a horse? It's more immersion breaking to see super intelligent beasts being simple Ubers.
---
I dont understand why i need to resub to check my account. I can see that I have access to my account through the bnet launcher and even if my live account is compromised then I couldn't care less as I will never play live again..
---
I do agree that subbing a few hours before might cause problems due to http overload but thats the only concern
---
I played on Khadgar also.  I remember those guilds and those names.  I wasn’t infamous since I started late into vanilla and did the pvp grind only getting to rank 11 before TBC.
---
Nah man I’m afraid not. 
---
With all the fire resistance mobs in MC/BWL you can do very well as an affliction Warlock in early classic. Some of the AQ is really sick as well. People tend to echo the conventional wisdom that mages crush Warlocks, but I found the gap to be closer than most people think. Walocks have a lot of tools in the box. 
---
Imagine a staircase from netherstorm to the mechenar? Lmfao
---
&gt; I see no reason to change anything now that I’m a grown man.
---
Good man. But dibs on Buttmustard if Zappyboi is taken for my human female paladin. I'm 36.
---
I know many people who were in the military (before 2010) who've never played a Blizzard game in their life and they were sent beta invites for games like SC2 and D3 before they were released.
---
I’m expecting to see alotttt or names starting with “TTV”
---
Yeah, though one thing that's very likely to be different between pservers and classic is how easy it is to farm your consumables.  Even for a non-hardcore guild you will still need everyone to be fully prepared for the content and that means quite a lot of consumes, especially during progression.  
---
&gt; one would expect the vast majority of those would rather play on an officially supported server
---
 
---
As a private server player, 100% true. Private servers are full of corruption, bugs, and the expectation of a short lifespan causing many players to have a very cutthroat attitude. Even the best servers are just awful, but so many people wanted vanilla so much they endured the pain anyway, me included.
---
And a 100% reason to remember the raid.
---
Yeah when private servers are peaking at 2k pop I bet they will start paying for the blizzard version
---
Thought I was the only one
---
Jestarl (gnome mage) from Deadly Panda Squad Rexxar server checking in.
---
Oracle was always a little bit ahead of us, we kept trying to catch up and we made good progress but could never quite beat you guys to server firsts. I was really surprised and glad to see your post. I assume you will be playing Classic as well? Are you in contact with any of your former guildies?
---
back in Legion, I farmed up a few WoW Tokens, so I could just use them to resubscribe and pay for the first few months of my WoW subscription.
---
Because NOCHANG NOCHANGERRRRS
---
A couple people but I am actually runnin my own guild. Send me a private message if you want to chat.
---
Back then? Pretty hardcore.
---
When Classic comes out? Likely a casual guild will be able to clear it in a weekend.
---
Shocadins are fine.  Every 3 minutes you can attempt to 1 shot someone.  Otherwise you use Flash of Light.
---
Yeah, the more I think about it, the more it makes sense that the very least go sword and axe from 20-40, but at 40 I’m going to respec Arms and if I can go axe from 40-60, I’d prefer that. It seems doable, but 52-60 is the Dungeon black hole. And you can’t really run BRD and kill emp, so illprobably just grind those last 8 levels with whatever I have (Gatorbite Axe?). 
---
Phenom.
---
I'm talking immersion with the world. Flying makes the world smaller and trivializes a lot of the lanscape. It's why i wouldnt play a cata relaunch, azeroth should never have had flying implemented.
---
I agree with what you're saying mostly, it would be impossible to have tbc without flying based on the way it's designed. That said, it doesn't mean I agree with flying being implemented in the first place. For example, if they decide to add content to classic servers that's not tbc, the last thing ide want to see is cata style flying in azeroth or a dungeon finder.
---
rofl can you imagine the launch? So many gamers want time off to get the unique experience... Kinda crazy
---
I spent so much time there. I remember wallwalking up the mountain  behind the portal between queues. 
---
Yeah and then maybe one day we'll get Classic BFA and we can get them to fix all of it's issues!
---
lorewise they do need to eat, just SIGNIFICANTLY less than every other race. 
---
source- horde war campaign in nazmir talks about it quite a bit
---
👋 I only want WoW to go back to the game philosophy they’ve abandoned, if they choose to rebalance classes I’d be grateful, if they choose to add new content after Naxx I’d be grateful, if they choose to remove debuff limit I’d be grateful. I just want to play World of Warcraft the MMORPG again instead of the trash that is retail.
---
Obviously this is not a popular opinion 
---
lol, doesn't sound that much fun :)
---
Which means Kara is un-openable 
---
Hunters play with swing timer addons, it's no biggie. 
---
maybe just don’t offer unsolicited language advice when you have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
I have to go with Ulduar. Karazhan is probably second. Sorry there's not a classic raid on my list.
---
Holy Shock is on a 30s cooldown, if that answers your question. Closest thing to a *'Battle Mage with shield and 1hr'* is an ele shaman.
---
Kara was so awesome.
---
My goal is every leveling dungeon while playing, get professions up and farm gold. Help people that need it, give out free ports in Org.
---
Really looking forward to just leveling in general. One thing that really helps leveling is the fear of dying. Using your other abilities rather than just damage ones to mindlessly destroy mobs.
---
I doubt I'll get to raid much, but I'll be going completionist on the things I can.
---
I think that is the hope for a lot of people, is that future expansions lean more towards the classic philosophy. That said, I think a lot of the conveniences in modern wow are too difficult to put back in the box. The outcry for removing lfr, cross-realm stuff, and flying would be enormous. 
---
You dropped these: .,.,. ,,.., ,, ,,,.,,,,, ,..,.
---
You are wrong, literally already confirmed. Stop spreading misinformation 
---
You’re getting trashed in all of these responses, but you’re right. Casual guilds with less than 40 players were clearing dungeons and many of the players weren’t taking flasks, pots, or enchantments.
---
Yes, the pserver crowd is mathematically optimal in demanding those things, but Vanilla didn’t require it and Classic will be even easier.
---
So make one yourself? 
---
Loads of dead bodies from the Aldor/Scryer elevators.
---
No elemental farming in Nagrand.
---
Lots of un-done daily quests in Blade's Edge.
---
&gt; What I accomplished in game is accomplished by some players in a matter of 1 month which when I look back was just sad how inefficient and stupid I was.
---
I recently rolled up on a private server. I recreated my first WoW character, a Tauren Warrior. One week after hitting 60, I already had better gear than the entire 2 years of vanilla. I had less purples, but better gear. I was def capped, and had a great set for solo. I capped all my weapon skills and got the 18 slot bag from AD rep farm. It was amazing what I could do with a little google-fu and 14 years of maturity. 
---
I mean I don’t care *that* much lol 
---
Yeah keep pushing for one on launch, but one way to express that demand if the "server choice doesn't exist" is if the appointed unofficial RP-PvP becomes very popular.
---
It was pretty fun rolling through there. Took very little time.
---
How much time do you need for the “final bit”? 2 weeks?
---
This is a 15 minute video just covering some tricks  you could use to Prepare for Classic WoW. Enjoy! 
---
yeah prob about that
---
I agree, when playing R shammy on [private server name here], I felt like I won the lotto, not needing many consumables. Mana pots and dark runes were easy for the most part, fire and the occasional arcane prot pot are needed by everyone, the only expensive bit was +mana flask. That huge buff to your mana pool makes a world of difference and I felt severely gimped without one. That was about it though
---
F
---
How long have you had that framed? :o
---
Oh my bad. They are all blending into one now.
---
I was a pvper for sure, i was 1% away from rank 10 or 11 when I quit and that was just from solo play. Undead Frost mage mostly hung around silithus when not pvping.
---
I completely agree. I mean, I no lifed the game to get it, after all, lol. But yeah, I love it especially on gnomes because you can see the shoulder glow really well. It's my favorite set in the whole game :)
---
That would be closer to casual guild in retail terms. I think 12 hours per reset is standard for most guilds.
---
Yep, it might start looking like Diablo 3 otherwise.
---
Yes, this one's actually reasonable and I suspect it might happen if Classic does well. 
---
Yeah! It was the hangout spot, for sure, before they added the battlemasters. I'm guessing we're just gonna get battlemasters right away in Classic, though, which is unfortunate.
---
In TBC, we leveled from 60-70 just fine without flying mounts. With the exception of Kazzak and the Tempest Keep instances, most of the "flying required" areas were added in mid-TBC. 
---
Ironically, my tryhard p server expected the most consumables from dps warriors. Their list was about twice as long as my resto shaman needs. With so many people playing the spec, you really needed every advantage you could to stay ontop of the Meters and maintain your raid spot. There will be plenty of guilds that won’t expect this of you OP, but just know if you play dps War, there is ALOT you can do to go above and beyond to stand out among your raid
---
You don't lose the sac buff when you enslave a demon. The felgaurd and infernal can be used after you sac.
---
Yeah, it was. I heard about it through the Countdown to Classic discord. I'm not sure how you'd get notified otherwise.
---
No harm done and i learnt something new :)
---
Maybe you should take your own advice and bugger off?
---
&gt;  totally redesigned
---
That's a big exaggeration. Which zones would need to be totally redesigned? TBC was designed to level players from 60 to 70 without flying. That's the majority of content in those areas.
---
You could create pathways to Kazzak, Skettis and O'grila. Add a flight points or portals to the TK instances. 
---
&gt; No-one will ever take off-specs like Enhancement Shamans or Moonkin to a raid because they're not optimal. Everyone must be playing their best spec in order to progress though any raid content.
---
Actually the only specs I can think of that are mostly avoided in "serious" raiding are Moonkins and Prot/Ret Pallies and Ele shammies to a slightly lesser degree. I have done a lot of research, asked guild leaders on pservers and even redditors about this.
---
Shadowpriests are brought because their debuff makes up for their personal DPS plus some (unlike Moonkins). For example if you have 4 Warlocks that is 60% of a Warlocks DPS, with 5 it's 75%. A Moonkin provides a 3% crit aura, even if we're nice and factor in crit based talents that is roughly 20% of a party member at most.
---
Enhancement Shamans are good for Nightfall uptime, provide stronger melee buff totems and since they don't need to manage their mana for healing they can dump mana into totem twisting. You can put them into your main tank group if threat capped or into a melee group if not. Factoring all of that in they are a good pickup for a raid.
---
Ele/resto shamans can be put into melee groups since those don't need manatide. They can raid heal and *apparently* provide some decent DPS after aquiring 2.5+ gear or on trash mobs before that. They aren't great at either role but will provide decent flexibility. I've never seen this one and there is little data about it, but it kind of makes sense.
---
Feral druids are arguably the best off-tanks and resistance tanks, while providing decent DPS when not on tanking duty unlike prot warriors.
---
All of those specs have unique strengths that make them useful for a raid and can be argued to improve the overall efficiency in one way or another. So we are really only talking about 3 specs that are mostly avoided and even they are brought by some guilds and clear Naxx because of the players behind them.
---
I personally wouldn't want to join a guild with a playstile/build that is suboptimal though.
---
Great points, just want to add for all those reading that Hurricane is available to the base Druid class, and isn't necessarily a benefit to Oomkins.
---
There are only two talents that Balance Druids in Classic WoW have that augment Hurricane (for reference, see the talent calculator [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid)): 
---
* Nature's Reach (does nothing for additional damage)
---
* Omen of Clarity (deceiving talent, not nearly as good as you'd think due to melee auto-attacks required for procs)
---
The points above said.. The two talents "Nature's Reach" and "Omen of Clarity" are actually talents that could be picked up by a druid running a similar build to the standard Resto endgame PvE spec [24/0/27 "Moonglow Build"](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0pj0IM0sZZxtcotq) (maximum efficiency Healing Touch spam) which could have effectively the same PvE healing utility with [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BB0_cHAAA8001w) instead - that by which does also pick up OOC for those who want those (heavily situational and fight-dependent) free Hurricane procs..
---
* Another data point to this - subjective but likely confirmable - is that a Resto PvE tuned druid quite likely might have more +dmg than the average Oomkin.. If nothing else because they are more accepted to raids and more frequently would get gear, which means that Hurricane in particular is likely just as potent if not more so with a Resto PvE Druid
---
How did you not look this up before posting, don't you have a phone?
---
I am going to tell you how I am going to prepare. I am going to legit find the major quest givers in horde zones.
---
I can tell you the first thing I am going to do when I hit 60 is murder every single quest giver on horde side until Blizzard decides to just make them inactive (but still allow quest turn ins) instead of giving DK when honor comes out.
---
I am sorry hordies. I hope you do the same to alliance. 
---
You were horde, right? I think I remember alliance not being able to do it from their side. Horde would terrorize us all the time, lol. But it was memorable, for sure.
---
Let's get down to business... 
---
To defeat!
---
The Horde!
---
Are you men excited? 
---
You seem, so bored!
---
The great thing about simulationcraft is that it is extensible. You can write an addition to have it perform whatever hunter rotation you specify, using whatever items and abilities you tell it to use. In other words you can configure it to do what you want, that is part of its functionality.
---
It's also open source, so you could modify it even further, but that is not necessary for what you want to achieve.
---
If you're DS/Ruin you can drop an infernal after you sac your pet. This has a solid DPS boost and almost never backfires on you. Almost never. 
---
Most raids won't let you summon a doomgaurd since a random party member dies and therefore loses world buffs. That makes it entirely not worth it. We did summon a bunch of them during farm content once just for fun tho. Good times.
---
Sounds like honest work to me :P
---
It was first capped to 15 people, which may be what you're remembering, and then later to 10 people.  But yeah, it's true that before any capping at all (which was pretty early on anyway), nothing had a limit.
---
They are pretty good about getting your toons back, gear might be gone but I got my toons back
---
I think you just hit peak moron.
---
No I was a lvl 30 gnome rogue twinked before they changed the level brackets. Took forever to get a game sometimes.
---
Blizzard, I know there's some underpaid intern reading this right now. 
---
Please, even if it's just *one* RP-PvP server.. do it 
---
&gt; I was just trying to say that the damage will be slightly boosted by  your spellpower so Hurricane’s damage is a bit more powerful on a  boomkin.  
---
Reasonable and valid idea, though one might want to consider that the average raid-capable PvE Resto Druid quite likely might have more +dmg than the average Oomkin, if for no other reason that they are taken to raid and collect gear that others might not want, or might collect +dmg/+healing gear if it was better than the +healing they might have had otherwise
---
Which might have the ironic result that an average PvE Resto Druid would have more potent Hurricanes than an average Oomkin, while also carrying the additional raid utility of simply being a healer
---
I played enhance all through vanilla and tbc
---
Gimme my crown of rag and my earrhshaker and you will still see me stunlock rogues occasionally.
---
Enhance in vanilla is more nuanced and warriors were the only thing I could rarely beat
---
Are you in retail wow? A private server? Get globally muted for saying something dumb in general?
---
Less servers with higher populations could help that. There were tons of low pop servers in retail. 
---
Lol, so many emergent ways to totally bone people over in vanilla. Gotta love it.
---
&gt; How much of this is because your realm community doesn’t matter as much because of xrealm?
---
Crossrealm is the enabler.  Prior to cata or the bnet overhaul all my contacts would have been players on us blackrock exclusively. 
---
&gt;I haven’t played since Cata and I can only compete dungeon runs in that era to my experiences in vanilla.  Anecdotally I remember WotLK and Cata as having much quieter runs.
---
If private servers are any indication they'll be no different than any other dungeon run experience you'd have if you formed the group and traveled to the dungeon in retail.  You can have chitchat if you want but most players just perform their role, indicate if they need certain quests and ask for buffs and conjured items.  Everyone knows the fights, there's nothing to actually say until things go wrong. 
---
Best hope you’re not on my server ;)
---
Cause I don’t give a shit like you do you loser.
---
I play pservers, and I don't imagine I'd be muted as I hardly talk unless I'm either requesting help or giving help.
---
Strange. Try resetting your in-game resolution. Sometimes that helps me find things I dragged off screen by accident
---
Pvp shadowpriest with Anathema and hopefully rank 12/13 gear.  I never got it since I was very pvp oriented and very late to the game in vanilla, I hit rank 11 before TBC and didn’t have a raiding guild since I was all pvp. 
---
I also want to have a try hard Druid tank alt for five mans and maybe a little raiding.
---
Paladins don't have buffs?
---
I can only imagine how powerful simulationcraft could be, however I'm not all that familiar with c++ so I'd either have to relearn it and get familiar with it to basically recreate the tool to fit for classic, or use something I am vastly familiar with (excel) and just import it into google sheets.. I would always choose the latter. Even with a semi-programming background it's 100x easier for me to navigate a spreadsheet. I have also thoroughly enjoyed working on this and can't imagine the rest being unenjoyable, so even if I'm the only one that ever uses it that's good enough for me :D just figured I'd share it with the community and if they want to leave feedback it's appreciated! I've gotten a lot of good feedback so far from discord servers, figured I should join reddit and post here too for anyone interested
---
Dam yall why the downvotes? If you disagree and really want cross realm dungeon finders please explain
---
No thanks, people like to blame flying for a lot of stuff that it didn't really do anything to.  And flying is kind of a core mechanic of the WC universe.
---
Obviously, this advice does not apply to everyone. Some have just recently unsubbed and know for a certainty that their account is ok. And yet a lot are like me, people who haven't played in years and age justifiably worried that their account might have issues. 
---
As for the idea of, "who cares if your main account is lost forever, make a new one when classic launches", there's a reason I never went back in and sold all my stuff or deleted my characters. They mean something to me and, although I personally feel current wow is a travesty, I'm still somewhat hopeful of positive changes that will bring back the community. 
---
All this thread is about its to let people know to get their account in order a few days before classic launches if, for nothing else, to have peace of mind on launch day. A gem that came out of this discussion, and something I never thought about, is to use my old characters to get gold to buy a few months. My main still has some incredibly unique items like: haunted memento  https://www.wowhead.com/item=40110/haunted-memento which I understand sells for a lot. 
---
They already said the demo wasn’t even close to complete. They want to make the game exactly the same as it was. This means that the numbers will most likely be the same. 
---
Must be a year now. Gave one to my buddy in that too. I recommend upping the contrast and brightness a little bit for photo printing.

&lt;Malicious Intent&gt; is a Semi-Hardcore Horde raiding guild that will be competitively pushing all high end content in classic WoW with a focus on both clearing content and having fun doing it. We will initially be raiding **two days a week with a possible third night for progression weeks (never on the weekend)**. We use a loot council system with static members and one member rotated in per week to keep the council a fair and diverse place. &lt;Malicious Intent&gt; will be focusing on 40-man content. We will have PvP and PvE events; these include - but are not limited to - farming Devilsaur, raid consumables, gearing under-geared guildies and possibly even city raids. We are mostly working adults which may cause us to clear at a slower pace, but our guild is competitive and progression focused - so we will clear content. While we are a raiding guild we also welcome social players to build and take part in our community.

---
On thing to keep in mind is that the classic servers will be able to be **fricken huge**
---
Some of the private servers out there had something crazy like 25k people on concurrently. The real vanilla servers were limited to what, 2k? 4k?
---
Hardware has come a long way and that will help smooth over a lot of the issues that Xrealm BGs were meant to fix in the first place.
---
This comment is so fucking wrong
---
[Better Quality](https://youtu.be/dUSRkBwQdc8?t=133)
---
I had earthshaker as well and I could literally stunlock people
---
Sorry mate. Zero.
---
It’s been a long time since I’ve played.  I do hope I can find more social people to play with then.  I’m a chatty person, and even when I’m not feeling chatty I like to hear friendly banter. 
---
I never played a private server either so I have no idea what they’re communities are like either. 
---
To be honest, if anything, the RP (PvE) servers might end up dead based off of recent polls.
---
Give us RP-PvP servers Blizz!
---
TBC was 100% designed for flying mounts. 
---
They are better off starting from scratch for a true expansion to classic.
---
The nice part is you feel progress. You don't think, "i have to sit here doing dailies for five weeks straight." It's more like meh I guess I'll do a dungeon for two hours snd mabye get a blue.
---
Not sure if it works for us but didn't we used to delete wtf and wdb folders when shit went down?
---
Absolutely! Daily grind is simply not something I can do either, so the idea of falling far behind because I can't log in every day is not enticing to me. 
---
OH SHIT I REMEMBER USING THAT OH SHIT 
---
I think T2 was the best looking set for pretty much all of the classes except maybe mage. That whole tier just fit the mildly cartoonish aesthetic of the rest of the game so well.
---
&gt;Enhance in vanilla is more nuanced and warriors were the only thing I could rarely beat
---
Savage... rip all enhance players then lolol
---
Tree of life is introduced in tbc.
---
Not a bad plan but token price is currently spiking a little due to people sticking around after the free weekend. Check back in 3 weeks. 
---
If you are raiding on a Shaman, you are healing. It doesn't matter what spec you are.
---
I've made a lot of posts about how you don't NEED to be full resto (you don't), but at the end of the day, you're still healing in raids. You're going to be spending a lot of time farming consumables, enchants, crafted gear, etc. And it's all going to be for your healing set.
---
That wasn't worth it for me. I don't mind healing - I'm more than happy to step into a healer role - but I didn't want my entire endgame experience to revolve around healing. It does for Shaman.
---
Everytime I think i want to play all I can think of is lightwell.
---
Shaman fits what you are looking for 
---
Scarab Lord won't be a title in classic but the mount is hella cool and the items from it are great.
---
I get chills every single time. So many dreamers rejoiced.
---
I just watched this on .25 speed. There are a lot of details that I missed the first time.  
---
Just after 50 seconds when the horde group is teleported up, there is an orc on the right side who loses footing and comes sliding into Naxx on their back.  
---
I did a rk14 as a full time researcher. There was a lot of down time and well it became obvious that I played. I still got my work done so I managed. Rd2 should be interesting. 
---
4 million interested in Classic makes sense. 4 million people trying it out as part of their retail sub... sure, I can see that. 4 million staying put in vanilla? Not a chance.
---
I love vanilla, but it is an acquired taste by today's standards. Not everyone is down for the monotony of the grind.
---
Unbread
---
What? 
---
Shaman has Purge, Grounding Totem for spells, Tremor totem for Fear, Earthbind Totem for slow, Frost Shock for extra slow and damage and a possible trinket.
---
Thank you.. I needed this.
---
Anything north of 500k, they are going to be woefully unprepared.
---
I think we're going to see 1-2 million in the first week, and probably some server fires lol.
---
&gt;Your client hides other people's debuffs by default, with no setting to change it (can only change this cvar through script/addons).
---
Yeah, that’s blizzlike. Mages had an ability called “detect magic” that would show you the enemy’s debuffs.
---
WOW. The video editing and sound editing is 10/10 this guy is GOOD
---
It depends on its a separate from the BFA launcher or not. If it launches from the [battle.net](https://battle.net) tab and you select from retail to classic, then its going to be 70gb min.
---
That TBC teaser at the end though. Can't wait for TBC!
---
I mean that would def be nice. I wouldnt mind that. But i think people would be highly against that. 
---
Can they actually do decent melee damage with one hander and a shield?
---
I was really planning on WC3 custom games holding me off until Classic, now it looks like Classic will be out first, so I won't have much time for customs :(
---
He confirmed it himself 2 years ago.

---
Apex is a lot more fun to watch than auto attacking boars for 30 hours 
---
I believe they said it was pointless to devote man hours to changing this as there would just be a mod to change it anyway. Also frees up modders to start work on other things.
---
Going to level two characters, one with spouse, one solo/friends. I don't expect either to hit cap for a long while, but that's okay. I'm in no rush.
---
Mostly plan on casual pvp
---
It doesn't really matter how many buffs you bring to the group if they aren't useful.
---
If you have 2-3 casters in the group they don't care about your agility, WF or STR totems at all and those buffs are useless to them.
---
The benefit of a Paladin is that they tailor a buff to each party member that specifically benefits that class.
---
Shamans are a bit better with AoE healing but in 5 man dungeons no one except the tank should be pulling aggro and there shouldn't be too much AoE damage going around to the point where you have to spam AoE heals.
---
When it comes to single target healing Shaman has the most inefficient heals out of all of the healers just for that task if we're talking about the amount of mana spent to health restored.
---
Paladin is the most efficient healer in the game, they have the most mana efficient heal in the entire game and they have the strongest buffs in the game as well which is why Alliance has the edge in progression content when it comes to raiding but Horde is better at speed running content that is already on farm.
---
I wouldn't say that Shaman is better than a Paladin in a 5 man dungeon, the only exception would be if you have a full melee group and in that situation I can see it be the case.
---
Most of the time in a PuG you want at least 1 Mage or sometimes even 2 if you want to make some dungeons super safe with 2 sheeps, so what a Shaman brings to the table generally speaking is better AoE healing (which most of the time shouldn't be required) with a trade off of being less mana efficient and buffs that don't benefit half of the party.
---
Paladin on the other hand brings the most mana efficient heals in the game and the strongest buffs that benefit each class individually, so generally speaking I would give the cake to Paladin.
---
With that said obviously any healer can heal any 5 man just fine. I was healing most of them on my Druid last year without ever having to drink because my gear was good enough to keep my mana up with Innervate every 6 minutes.
---
Who's even is this obese neckbeard?
---
Okay there Brack-lite lmao he basically said "you think you do but you don't", despite the reason they're making it being that they thought we didn't but we do.
---
You won't get many part invites to dungeons as an enh shaman who can't heal.
---
Your dps is super low and restricted by melee range without any of the benefits of high burst damage other melee classes have.
---
Your primary attack is entirely RNG, and been nerfed 3 times at this point.
---
You can't sustain what little damage you have b/c you are mana bound in raids -- and further more your two main sources of damage (stormstrike and earth shock) generate high threat and leave a debuff; making you an active dps hinderance ironically as "dps".
---
You are highly prone to be kited in pvp and are quite bad in most 1v1's. 
---
You lack the ability to heal yourself reliably and have a low mana pool. 
---
You compete with gear with fury warriors, arms warriors, and hunters.
---
No raid set in Vanilla caters to Enhancement.
---
The list goes on.
---
Not a bad statistic at all. I was just pointing to the data that is closer to what Blizzard might have.
---
I appreciate your passion and enthusiasm, but lets take a closer look at things.
---
1) Yes, player base for Classic is different from current retail. These numbers are from "actual" servers that Blizz rolled out from Van to when the monster server merge happen. 
---
2) All servers did NOT in fact lean toward PVP. This is where the vocal minority kicks in. Again.. per number of servers rolled out in NA.  PVE 128 PVP 106. 
---
3) The survey is skewed by only being representative by largely this subreddit not the whole playerbase.
---
I know it might seem I am coming down hard on you and that is not my intention. My purpose is to broaden everyone's thinking to the fact that we dont have 2 sides. Not Private Server against Retail. Not PVP against PVE.. we have one large base of fans who all share passion.. some more than others.
---
Blizzard will go by what makes sense for them and the data they have at hand. That data is what they had in the past and how those numbers held out historically. Is this going to be the same picture as what shakes out? Who knows for sure.. But being a company that has to roll out infrastructure they have to take an educated guess and hope to get it right.
---
And as I said before. We need to keep raising this issue so Blizzard sees it and does roll out realms for all. And I think a good conversation about expectations is healthy. 
---
The playerbase is going to be bigger than I think many think. It will decline then rise again. And I suspect they will roll out more servers at launch than some believe. The number they had for the demo alone give me hope for that.
---
I just can't wait for it to get here.
---
And for the record, I will roll on a RP or PVE server  :)
---
You're asking me to imagine too many things.
---
I'm not sure what's real anymore...
---
Dude even the fucking rpers don't rp until the end of an xpac bc they're doing other stuff. I stopped my sub months ago bc if I literally spend my few hours a day looking for some rp instead of rping, then it's time to kill the old goat. Now I intend on giving it a go again when classic comes out, but ffs don't torture yourself dude. We don't deserve it.
---
He's been a meme for being fat for a long time. Now he's a meme for being a cuck, too. 
---
I'll give it another look when I'm off of work
---
&gt; I don't think you will be able to just /camp /resetinstance() and then login at the entrance but we will see this is just my prediction
---
I don't know about /camp, but /resetinstance() is kind of important. There needs to be some mechanism to reset if your party bails on an instance.
---
You don't have to sub to check out your account. You can log in for free and even play any characters up to level 20 to make sure everything is ok.
---
And a woman abuser
---
&gt; they are the best dungeon healers in groups   
---
&gt; that dont screw up too much   
---
&gt;They are much better than paladins 
---
Given that you and I and everyone know that "don't screw up *too* much" is a good joke, to be the devil's advocate (as a lifetime Horde player), here's a comparison to **Paladins in particular** (of the two Priests/Paladins that you mentioned):
---
* Efficiency and buff wise, Paladins apply buff, it stays on group members... Shaman applies totem, has to reapply ANY totem that's been applied after group advances more than 30 yards (exceedingly costly in dungeon crawls outside of bosses)
---
* Also *efficiency wise*, Paladins have more mana-efficient heals - take Flash of Light vs Lesser Healing Wave for example (comparable fast heals @ max rank):
---
   * Flash of Light rank 6: [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19943](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=19943) costs 140 mana, heals "343 to 384" (+ healing from X modifier that I'm too lazy to Google) resulting in 2.5964... heals/mana (quick mafs)
---
   * Lesser Healing Wave rank 6: [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10468](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=10468) costs 380 mana, heals "832 to 929" (+ healing from X modifier that I'm too lazy to Google) resulting in 2.3171... heals/mana
---
      * Pro to LHW: LHW heals for strictly higher values, and is stronger as a burst heal, which very much matters of course!
---
* Paladins are passively tankier (for when screw ups *will* happen)
---
* Paladins can bubble themselves if they gain healing aggro (for when screw ups *will* happen)
---
* Paladins can bubble *other players* when said players pull aggro from the tank (for when screw ups *will* happen)
---
* Paladins can give Blessing of Salvation (-30% threat generation) to *any* group member that constantly pulls aggro from tanks (or less vindictively, would be able to put out more dps if not limited by tank threat)
---
It's true that Shamans can\* (potentially) make the whole group more potent than a Paladin\* (given a multitude of constraints, such as totem range limits, Shamans not having all totem flavors until level \~30 (iirc), totem spam being extremely mana expensive and laborious)... but a healer's *job* \- especially in a 5 man dungeon - is to keep the whole team *alive* first and foremost, where Paladins have many more tools to do so. 
---
Shamans might be better at speed runs.. maybe? Though, as far as I remember, the only "speed run" that actually matters in vanilla is Strathome 45 minute Baron runs where Paladins have their normal tools (read: better at keeping group alive, which matters a lot when you're doing chain pulls) while also unlocking their class's "Undead Slaying Capabilities" available such as Exorcism, Holy Wrath &amp; possibly more..
---
Nope, sorry.
---
The answer is always yes
---
A guy that's been riding his 5 minutes of fame for the past 10? years
---
No idea about that. I don't keep tabs on the guy. 
---
You have to log into the game to see your characters. Characters below a certain level don't show up on the armory if they haven't been played in a while. But they will definitely still be there in game.
---
I want to roll a SPriest for world pvp. what would the best way to get  geared up and would the pvp gear be the bis for pvp? i plan on playing 2 years+
---
banned for self harm.
---
Took a drinking stream a bit too far.
---
&gt; And I'm still going to roll night elf Priest - just like I did back in Vanilla - because I don't care about this fucking meta that's surely gonna destroy mayor parts of the fun in classic.
---
Shadowmeld is criminally underrated.
---
Literally nobody who speaks fluent English was confused by his choice of words.
---
If you wanna be a monster, play warrior. You'll need dedication though. 
---
Logging into the website will require your authentication code if you have one, so you can easily log into the website to see if that would be an issue.
---
Sounds like an irresponsible use of data to me. I'd personally like to make sure the planet is in an acceptable place for future generations. 
---
You don't have to buy anything except the $15 sub fee. In fact even for Retail WoW you can get up to 110 with just the sub fee. Only extra purchase required for Retail is the BFA expansion pack - game doesn't even require a box price beyond that. For Classic, they have confirmed it's just the sub fee, nothing else.
---
True, probably get a lot more chat interaction in classic though 
---
I wasn't sure where you were going with this but that was quite an intelligent way of framing it.
---
RIP. Though it would be something like this https://twitter.com/Cloneman16/status/1107779613906788352?s=20
---
Chain heal didn't smart target players with its jumps until patch 1.12
---
That's a pretty enormous buff for resto shaman.
---
Woosh, and very rude

Vanilla is a small world. I was on Laughing Skull with PALS FOR LIFE (but you knew that already). One of the early pals ended up basically switching to playing with Nurfed because he ended up working with and befriending some of them IRL. If I'm not mistaken, he got to know some Blizzard people through them, too, and now he works there. 
---
Just move em to your desktop, then run the client. It'll create new folders and settings. If it didn't fix it, replace the folders with those on your desktop. 
---
GL. Hope you figure it out!
---
Azgalor represent. I pvp'd with a guild and come to find out the gl lived not too far from me. Became RL friends but IRL got busy for us both. 
---
I do remember pvping a ton on my human mage (Gadolphos) and my gnome lock (Geezard) and having a blast with guild pre-mades. So fun WSGing it up with prot pallies who just wouldn't die.
---
One notable I remember (albiet was TBC) was an UD warrior, was a BS, and made the mace epic 2h weapon and it's upgrades. He had my number everytime. I couldn't lock him down like I could everyone else. Forgot your name, but your antics will forever stay with me!
---
If he phrased it as *"Folks with ~1 hour a day to play will find it hard to even hit 60. And will **likely** give up along the way."* then I'd be inclined to agree. At least partially.
---
But people need to stop writing off the game for being too time intensive.
---
The *"MMOs can never be popular because they require too much time"* argument **pre-dates Vanilla WoW**. And Vanilla proved it wrong. Vanilla brought the weekend warriors, the hardcores/turbonerds, the flakey re-sub-once-every-three-months crowd. Classic may be able to do the same. 
---
&gt; I for one would love to see paly and **druid tanks** but it would require  drastic changes to the way vanilla works and that won't happen... 
---
You underestimate the power of a Tank Druid that farms some [level 29 blue maces](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) every week and 14+ years of time and experience to allow some [intrepid players to prove this idea wrong](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)!
---
* TL;DR: Tank Druids have been proven to be not just viable, but *preferred* off tanks for reasons described by the player Taladril (assuming appropriate conditions are met and stigma is burned at the stake)
---
... sorry about Paladins though, Paladins don't have a cheer-worthy comeback like Tank Druids :(
---
If you were playing a trial account on retail, that’s not how classic will be. I had like 3mill gold on retail before I quit (was around 4.5 at one time). I wasn’t broke but I wasn’t considered rich, middle of the road. Inflation is nuts on retail, people have been amassing gold for 1.5 decades now. The classic economy will be fresh. 
---
At the moment my friends and I are considering making a progression Guild. But there's some discussion on exactly how hardcore we will be so the decision to actually make a guild is still up for debate.
---
Assuming no Guild, my goal is to become very well known for being King of the dungeons. I want to be able to tank DPS and heal any dungeon, as a druid. When I log on I want people to whisper me asking me to join their groups because there one short.
---
Assuming the guild is created the end goal would be to push into naxx
---
Looking for a guild on NA west PvP will be rolling paladin healer. Looking for medium level guild to raid and PvP with.  
---
I have no idea how anyone can stand to watch this dude, nor do I have any idea how he's even remotely popular still, but whatever. That's neither here nor there.
---
People like this just don't get the point of Classic WoW. Literally it being slow is the entire draw. I'm not planning on playing the game eight hours a day, nor am I going to be particularly upset if it takes me a long time to level.
---
I enjoy the mechanics of the original game. I enjoy that world, and I'm going to enjoy playing and exploring it again.
---
That Classic is so antithetical to the modern game development mindset (and "gamer" mindset, even) is what makes it so attractive to me.
---
90% of people on a pve server only want to pvp?
---
i think they did something very wrong
---
Yeah I'm removing that from my vocab now
---
Simple! Stay home and play WoW.
---
Fate is cruel.
---
hahaha. I will always refer to this NPC as whatever his name is the Unbread.
---
I try to find a nice guild to raid with which won't break apart and isn't too hardcore in terms of raiding (as in "we take warrior/rogue as melee dps only, ranged will only be mages with a few locks sprinkled around"). I doubt this will happen, but one can dream.
---
Other than that i will level classes who have a special weapons like Priest with Benediction/Anathema or Hunter with Rokk'dalar and Lok'dalar. Biggest goal is of course Sulfuras, Thunderfury, Atiesh.
---
I never was big for PvP in retail, because everyone has an answer for everything yadayada, so i will try PvP in classic as well, though i will suck hard probably. Trying to defend leveling fellows as the one thing i hate most is high level people killing lowbies like that takes any skill. Maybe even make an RP-like "Mercenary Group" lowbies can hire if "Facemeltor", the Night Elf Shadow Priest with his friend "DeathVenom" or "ShadowKiller", the Night Elf Assassination Rogue decide its cool and fun to kill level 20s as level 40s because they get their asses handed to them if they PvP at 60.
---
I doubt i will achieve any of this though, but its nice to think about what could be.
---
35 gigabytes was the price for the screenshots

No mercy. Red is dead.
---
I'm the only true RPer in the server
---
Dungeons. 5-mans.
---
Great math, just one thing though... all the games you mention are active games. Classic is to a certain extent in the equivalent of a pre-beta stage. Classic players also share interests with r/wow in that they're the same game in different versions and a certain subsection of players who intend to play Classic are ok with just being a part of default WoW sub and see no need to also sub to Classic. Overwatch &amp; Apexlegends don't have these issues so its hard to make an apples to apples comparison. 
---
Still, your methods bring up interesting conclusions.
---
[Here's the link to 1.12 patch notes.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0) I for one want cross-realm BGs to be a thing. I really don't care that much about server communities outside of guilds and the shorter the BG ques, the happier I am.
---
AH prices will be inflated due to people knowing people having less time to farm for mats and items  as in current wow there done with in a few minuets.  
---
Keeping a 40+ team progression ready and how time consuming gearing all those people will be.
---
RNG will play a big factor as well for guilds with loot / cds , obtaining the right gear for tanks and  resist gear( 40+ people have to have it  + a main set)   
---
Running things like BWL or  Onyxia  for the buff as well as getting zandalari tokens for spirit of zand buff as well + other world buffs, so you will be running another 2 more full raids each week before starting Naxx so thats 3-4 days of raiding unless your doing 6-10hr sessions before u even get into nax + the time it takes to farm consumables. Now this is min maxing but believe me people did it.
---
Then u have certain boss mechanics that require multiple tanks or more heals than normal so u have to have dps set up with a tank spec  with amazing gear just for one boss ect ect   
---
Its not hard to do any of this its more so the RNG and time it takes to make all this happen , this is why back in vanilla 50-60 guilds cleared nax properly , thats roughly 2300-2500 people when the player base was 15-18mil . 
---
This is just my opinion and experience but i personally believe a lot of people will get at least to AQ/BWL with attendance being the only issue.   
---
on a side note: I cant wait to see how new players manage threat mechanics.   
---
Definitely agree with you on all of that. TBC raids will always have a special place in my heart. I think about my experiences raiding in TBC often.
---
Though I don’t know the exact video you are talking about, Asmo’s chat often spams things to get a rise out of him, much like many streamers tbh, but creating a wall of text improves their chances of being seen.
---
It isn’t just you, sure there’s a number of people saying it’s all nostalgia, but there’s also a high number of people that just don’t like what WoW has turned into.
---
One of the biggest things I see from people, myself included, is they can’t stand how sharding had ruined a sense of community, which we assume will be in.
---
[John Gabriel’s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory explains it pretty well](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) 
---
Farming pre raid BIS for myself and my group of friends, also farming my full dungeon set because I want it. Pvp and some raiding if time allows. 
---
I'll level atleast one 29 twink to play when I want a break from my 60 but I'm a chronic farmer who will spend alot of time either farming with my wife/friends in 5 mans or goofing off in the world farming. I like making gold and enjoy laid back farming. 
---
Naming definitely changed. My first three were all named after my favourite three characters in a Swedish D&amp;D campaign
---
Rimlove was my shaman
---
Blodughadda was my warrior
---
Barkebull was my druid
---
Will most likely go with those names again.
---
Post-vanilla names got a little bit more creative...
---
Veryspooky the warlock
---
Realgoodboy the paladin
---
Loafalkman the deathknight (named after a Swedish opera singer)
---
Etc...
---
Hello, fellow vanilla Kilrogg player. xD
---
Played Resto shaman back when and all we were expected to bring was food and a boatload of mana pots. Don't recall consumables being as big a deal then, my guess is that this will change dramatically. Cleared all content up to twin emps, didn't touch Naxx.
---
 It was a much bigger deal in TBC.
---
wut
---
SL locks are better tanks then you might think. I tanked Twemps in progression raiding and also tanked Ony and most of MC just for a fun a few times. I'm sure someone who took it seriously for some reason might get further.
---
I will agree that mages are the worst tanks, but I would guess that the order is something like this:
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Druid
---
3. Paladin
---
4. Hunter
---
5. Warlock
---
6. Shaman
---
7. Rogue
---
8. Priest
---
9. Mage
---
But unpaid internships hold so much vertical potential! 
---
Fine work, but massively over edited for my taste. This is about the level of Chinese action movies with little flair for the actual location 
---
I'll stick with the classics when it comes to advertising naxx. Which was 'the' naxx video back in the days
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp5JNSGkBDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp5JNSGkBDA)
---
There was a time where mobs could only have 8 debuffs. Deep wound would push off important debuffs so No one was fury. All warriors tanked dps was crap. 
---
Advantage to roll ally? Better rep based racial, solid defensive pve buffs(fear ward), elves(!), having easy to navigate cities. 
---
Disadvantages are horde have way better FP's in some zones, horde are always trying to pvp either im stealth or in groups, and there is a massive amount if people in elwynn/westfall because everyone wants to do DM quest chains...

This pic has a peaceful vibe
---
Oh yes the good old melee hive mind.
---
Literally a dude on my server named Mosthated, NE Hunter, fucker just ganked anything and everything and it seemed like thats all he did for like three expansions lol.
---
It’s sarcasm, sort of. Chat selectively agrees with Asmon and disagrees for his reaction. Most of his viewer base agrees Classic is going to be fun and successful.
---
Don’t try to understand chat, if is a deep, dark, well.
---
im assuming a battlechest w/ active sub will be enough, nothing in stone yet tho
---
You heard him. Hes just trying to be environmentally friendly with data
---
While I agree that old servers grow stale, this is inevitable no matter how you control it.
---
Also I actually think classic wow will be experienced in less than a year (given that most players are return players) despite the phased content releases. 
---
Ultimately, I think Blizzard needs to release the game without too much of advertisement. The servers grow stale mostly if the players all get to end game and there are not many 'newbs'. Remaining or fresh players will not have the same expereince as the Day 1 players when the servers were full of people. 
---
The reason original vanilla wow worked was because: 
---
1. It was a new game(obviously)
---
2. There were constant flow of new players after YEARS
---
3. Leveling and development (farming/raiding) were actually painstakingly tedious but fun
---
In order for the Classic Wow to work, Blizzard needs to figure out a way to NOT let everyone and their mom who is excited about wow to start day 1 and ALL end at day x waiting for the next content to drop. That's going to get old super fast. 
---
Your solution of releasing servers in waves is a good solution but due to Blizzard's finite resources, they will not 'holdback' servers if Day 1 opening has more than anticipated players. They will open everything they have. 
---
Seeing this live with the virtual ticket felt like a dream - it felt like just the other day, we were all being told "yeah, you think you want it but nah you don't - no vanilla servers for you" only for *the exact same guy that sais that* (J Allen Brack) to come on stage and announce Classic.
---
Good old Anvilmar. Also my server although I started in BC, Fear the Foot was our guild horde side
---
&gt; That being said
---
Ultima Online was my first MMO and these sort of player driven events were common and what truly made the game memorable for me.
---
I think to some degree all early MMOs had this spirit. The idea that player activity could drive drama as much, if not more than the narrative the game was walking you through.
---
I'll enjoy Classic no matter what, but if it can in some way recapture that idea of community generated content (in particular World PvP) I think it will be a real winner.
---
This isn't Blizzard's responsibility, it's up to the playerbase.
---
No, but neither can paladins
---
No daily missions, no checklists, no demands, just an open world and you figure out the rest. Over a decade later and it’s still amazing 
---
Well put OP
---
Im Australian, no need to be like that. 
---
legitimately not trolling. i just can't see Blizzard skipping such an obvious and perfectly opportune cash grab 
---
Nothing wrong with leveling as Balance. Just keep in mind Feral is the 2nd or 3rd fastest leveler in the game where balance is probably one of the slowest. So if you wanna level fast play Feral, if you don’t mind slowing down because you enjoy the balance/Resto playstyle by all mean play that. Just depends if speed or playstyle is more important to you.

RP in a normie pvp server

Wish the Video was higher quality, I was Horde on Deathwing, Id like to see if I recognize any names from the vid. I remember Pretty Pink Pwnies mostly just from raiding near the end of BC. I played WoW from Beta to Wotlk very consistly, but not seriously until near BCs end
---
I think they should release as many servers as they want at launch. However, eventually things will get stale, zones will get empty, and subs will drop. If they want to bring people back, they need to have server launch events where you can experience vanilla wow from day 1 again. I've seen it on private servers, and it will be a great way to have people coming back to re experience a fresh vanilla server.
---
Maybe they get a power spike with AQ40 gear.
---
I have no idea.
---
But there are other factors to consider, like blizzard is dedicated to releasing a classic experience and as everyone should remember there was no RP PvP server on day one launch of either the US servers or the EU ones. They came out after dire maul was released but before Raggy was killed for the first time. 
---
1. Get an faction mount other than my own faction (orc).
---
2. Get a huge weapon. 
---
Found the paladin

Taking twitch chat seriously is a waste of time. Too many different people. Someone enjoys the streamer, other guy wants to push his agenda and some like memeing in chat. There's no point reading into anything. It doesn't matter.
---
Thanks Op, now I need to rethink my resto shaman or holy priest rolling decision.. lol
---
I would have to think that worst case of worst cases, bethesda might only launch classic with a pitifully low number of RP servers, and expand them as people fill them-theres no way they don't know of the lengths people go to RP their games
---
From what I've heard so far, world buffs worked differently in retail vanilla than they do on p servers. Some world buffs are spammable on p servers where as in retail vanilla they had a cooldown once someone got one and it couldn't be gotten by anyone again for hours.
---
I pick my battles. I prey on the weak. I got gang banged in my past life by a pack of Murlocs while I was minding my own business as an herbalist. Now I am  a disgruntled forsaken looking for revenge. I have been practicing with daggers and putting my herbalism to good use with experimenting with different poisons.
---
Sign me up
---
More like they were scared of getting ganked while leveling but now that they reached 60, they want to flex on others and taunt people to flag pvp
---
MAGE
---
But this one doesn't have the crowd reactions lol.
---
If it’s true classic transferring won’t be an option. It’ll be reroll or bust. 
---
As the other guy said, transfers weren’t in vanilla. What makes you so sure they’ll exist in classic?
---
I actually was an absolute tool when I was 12 and tried really hard to come up with cool sounding fantasy names. 15 years later I name my characters shit like Fartnozzle. 
---
Yah a french baguette is hard as rock. You can smash it against a counter and basically use it like a broken beer bottle.
---
I got an email. Logged in and realized I could hide shoulders now in transmog. That was about it. Did 30 minutes of the compulsory intro quest at 100, got two epics and a blue for doing almost nothing.
---
There are p servers which exist for 6-7 years and still have an active community. Don't worry there will be plenty of players sticking around, especially because it's an official server, not some shady private realm.
---
He’s obviously a shaman
---
Oh hi, that’s me recording... and screaming. A day I will never forget. 
---
Sword and board doesn't do lots of damage for anyone
---
What if they shock everyone and release it early? Stranger things have happened.
---
Only reason to rush an easier character up first before your main is in fact for money, my bad. I'm just more worried about the way the game will feel if you played something cheap, then came back and played something back breaking-it would get to peoples nerves and might drive them away from continuing on....and we might not be able to afford to lose many people of the playerbase depending on how many are actually going to stick around
---
If we can communicate as a community, it's easy for us to have a normal PvP server that everyone rolls on, as an unofficial RP-PvP.
---
If we also do this openly, with a forum and talk about it. Blizzard will really see their mistake and release a RP PvP at launch.
---
The last Phenom II came out in 2010 though.
---
I'm going to try and grab 5 names on toons the first day. Ranging from my first two names to the names I was later known by. Even have each class for the name picked out. 
---
I thought they already said it was going to be through battle.net if I'm not mistaken.
---
Level an alt, join a meme spec raid, start a PvP rivalry with someone or a whole guild.
---
The race mentality is going to be very common in Classic, and may well be the best way to experience it. But I don't think it's fair to say that's a 'preservation' of what made Vanilla what it was.
---
You can't put the genie back in the bottle, but knowing the content release schedule doesn't mean you're forced to live and die by it. Enjoy the World for what it is, do some things inefficiently, build a community.
---
A lot of PVE gear is bis for PVP because PVP doesn't cover all your slots. But the Champions gear (up to rank 10) is pretty decent and the rank 12-14 stuff is (obviously) very good. 
---
Shadow priests tend to be tough to gear up in PVE because they fall far behind locks and mages on prio. As spriest you generally won't be funneled gear til content is on farm. Even though it might be your main spec, it will be treated as though it is an offspec with regard to loot. 
---
I say get to 60, try to pick up a couple decent items from dungeons (and buy felcloth/bloodvine as it is available to you depending on patch) and start grinding for your rank 10+ gear. It will serve you pretty well.
---
Even if it's just one server that's active, I'll be happy. Though I suspect it will be a bit more than that. 
---
My point C'thun is by far harder, our problem was the tbc announcement.
---
I still wouldn't go into Naxx without buffs. 
---
A good warrior 2h cleave and sweeping strike and mow shit down pretty fast.
---
Compared to a rogue who is a furry warrior in leather gear basically, face tanking all mobs. Warrior is better if you know how to do it. Try 2h swing timer and kite with hamstring.
---
you know it's gonna be great when the people who made the video, also are the ones posting it.
---
I'm not coming back to this sub till I'm 60
---
Tier 0.5 gear is not coming until phase 5 with the AQ event.

Dude.. DOTA on WC3 was the only game taking dudes off WoW at my local PC LAN shop. 
---
You mean in the same way you select PTR? 
---
I don't understand how people do not notice a fucking difference in the way numbers appear in vanilla vs. retail or even the demo. I already had to give up on moonwalking being a thing, if I have to give up on the way numbers appear, I'm gonna be upset. 
---
Thats sweet. I want to have a buddy like you lol
---
Someone is having deviat surpreme for dinner.
---
Going holy is the answer if you want to rank; and not even because it is better than ret per se; ret has a ton of pvp utility. The bigger issue is that few people know how to play with ret pallies. If you want to rank you're gonna have to find a reliable premade, and any premade worth it's salt will slot you into a healer role. If you refuse, they might boot you to take in a healer. 
---
Like PVE, the PVP scene has evolved to the point where most classes have set roles and that's that. Plenty of spriests spend most of their time healing in PVP (which takes them out of shadow form). You can still roll ret and try to rank, but understand that 90% of the people you play with will demand you to heal.
---
Oh snap that is what it was called. It’s even in OPs post. I was at work and googled a vanilla  map and tried to remember roughly where it was located. I think it got changed to Scarlet Enclave during WoTLK for the Deathknights starting area? 
---
Or I’m just real lost here lol. 15 years ago was a long time

here’s one for you. ‘learnt’ isn’t a word.

I don't get this reference.
---
Stands for Twitch TV. Aka kids trying to promote their 3 viewer streams
---
then sub the day of when they release it early? 
---
Did they make the minimum character count higher in time, any idea? I assume the already named would be grandfathered in back then, but perhaps they stopped the ability to have 2 letter names?
---
It's almost like people want to share the things they make! 
---
Taladril actually [makes a compelling argument](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) about bear tanking in vanilla; it's really not that meme-y at all.
---
tl;dr is that a moderately geared (and obviously skilled) bear tank can tank up to ZG and MC as MT and can OT through Naxx. The greatest argument for having a bear tank is that it doesn't really compete for gear with prot warriors so you it's impact as OT is additive to the MT.
---
Ah ty, hadn't heard it abbreviated that way before (don't hang around TTV often) but, yes no doubt. It'll be 4 streamers if I see TTV doe, those little sruodi streams can sometimes be the best lol. 
---
Probably play a bit more in the start and then slow down. Not going to rush things. It's the journey that matters! At 60 it's probably a bit of both pve and pvp.
---
Hunter. Full T1–&gt;Full T2–&gt;Full T3. Simple as hell. 
---
Tank warrior. 
---
Rogue uses some. 
---
Shaman uses some (T2) and could use full T1 as well. 
---
Priest can use full T2 (not super knowledgeable on priests though). I’ve seen some doing that and others using offpieces. 
---
Druid uses some but not all. T2 3-pc bonus is stupid strong. 
---
Paladins uhh, don’t really use it outside of PVP until T3. 
---
Mage/lock don’t really use theirs aside from 1-2 pieces until T2.5 comes in. 
---
If you’re going to play until that point, a mage with T3 shoulders and some other pieces looks pretty damn sweet, but that’s far in the future. 
---
Rim... Love? 
---
Is runescape a good game to try? I was looking for an mmo lakin to vanilla to burn some time...
---
Samesies, but like 10. Need to prioritize the ones that are more likely to be snagged. I also want at least one of them as a horde, so would have to change realm list. Idk how I'm gonna do it but perhaps two subs first month..got plenty of licenses, though not BFA, do darn, my plan is foiled! 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if blizzard trys to wipe out names after a short period to rid the "played for s day" names. Thoughts?
---
&gt;As a paladin I’d imagine weapon skill is more important as every auto can glance
---
To continue this tangentially, this is not as important for a protection paladin (viability of prot not being discussed rn) because threat comes primarily from holy damage, i.e. Seal of righteousness, which will deal the same amount of damage regardless of of the auto attack glances. So it only matters for ret. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Doh! Supposed to be a K in there.
---
Speaking from experience, don't go enchant unless you're going to be the designated guild enchanter. It's a huge money sink to level and the only way you make money from it is if you have all the good, rare, enchants -- which are usually funneled to a single, reliable person in the guild. And even then, once the enchant ages a little bit you make less and less off it as it is less in demand.
---
Take up a gathering prof like herbalism; herbs will ways be in demand.
---
As for the truefaith; it kinda depends how much you plan to play. The static c/d can be nice to flip 2 felcloth into a mooncloth every 4 days for some easy gold, but if you're going to be playing more than intermittently, you can probably make more with a profession like alchemy in four days than you could flipping felcloth into mooncloth. Just my two cents though.
---
Samesies!!
---
Yes, but that still doesnt mean a proper serious raid will be wasting 1 slot on Mortal strike.
---
Alright, perhaps that is also one of those things that they will change.
---
Yeah if they allow horde and alliance on the same server I'll be adding a 6th name. My OG shaman name! Original used on a spacegoat though!
---
True, the population size combined with the active pvp population of the server does dictate quite alot how big of a challenge you're up against.
---
Play a faction or class you don't plan to necessarily in Classic. You'll get to familarize yourself with the world and meta, but you won't burn yourself out by having to repeat the same quests with the same leveling mechanics again in 4ish months (or whenever soon™ is)
---
This is the 4th or 5th time I’ve watched this, and I still can’t believe how good it is!
---
Why do i want to punch him in the teeth so bad
---
Simple - hunter is super not dependent on gear to do well in the world. Also decent wpvp since you will always track them down and not be surprised. Cheers.
---
For those that would like to wear their full tier sets, would it be frowned upon in raids?
---
If it's an *intentional* alt - Mage is good for portals, food/water, etc (for your main). Also good for gold farms.
---
Gear wise - you'll want *some* level of gear to smooth out world pvp, dungeons, and gold farming. Hunter/Mage for DPS and Paladin/Priest for healing would be the best imo. Warlock/Rogue are decent too, but I'd reckon in a *slightly* lower tier since they want gear more.
---
A very important thing for saving money while leveling is: DO NOT train every rank or every skill that is available from your trainer every time. It's expensive.
---
Example: hunters don't NEED to train either of the non-damage stings, many of the trackings, immolation trap, explosive trap, mongoose bite, higher ranks of wing clip, several aspects, and more.
---
I'd hope they don't allow both factions on one PVP realm, just to stick to less changes. I haven't heard many people talk about that yet though.  Have you? 
---
Haha, I'm so glad cause I thought maybe you were trolling for a second 😂
---
"Choose" to play with low fps. That's right, we kids chose to not upgrade our parents computers. What are you, old? Lul get off games.
---
Let's be real, RPers just sit in Goldshire jerking each other off, can't pvp when horde are just RPing in goldshire on level ones.
---
Don't you know? For every screenshot you take a mile of the Amazon rainforest is destroyed.
---
Holy crap... this is absolutely amazing.  This guy can make some awesome videos.
---
Is he on Reddit? 
---
The hope is that they learn that we don’t want a game that’s a roller coaster ride that gives out free candy at the end. We want Normandy. We want to slog through the trenches till we emerge at the end victorious. Making the game harder and slower paced is the hope. After years of LFR it’s not going to go away. My hope is that they introduce server types with “classic” settings that completely remove the lfr tools and some of the other aspects that make the game easier like flying. 
---
I'd love to see a comparison video for the BfA announcement. 
---
Wellll horde have no pallys so they’re stuck with shamen 😆
---
On topic of the one enhance shaman with nightfall, some guilds may be ok with it but it isn’t a role I’d recommend. You’ll be auto attacking and casting occasional shocks, and be lowest dps in the raid. You’ll get last priority for any gear, because everyone can use it better than you, and you’ll still have to heal on some fights. Guilds would be significantly better off having a warrior using nightfall, who can spam hamstring to proc it, or a melee hunter spamming wingclip. 
---
Name actually got reported because People thought it was a clever way to get around banned names. Had to explain myself to a GM and ultimately got to keep the name. Pretty funny that I made the same mistake all these years later ROFL.
---
I am planing to main hunter. This spreadsheet is godsend!!! TY, i am not knowledgeable enough to suggest anything, but as i see its beautiful :D bookmarked until summer :)
---
I do think classic wow has a more niche audience and a lot of us hype it hard. So the math could be way off.
---
But atleast 1 mill players isn't unbelievable.
---
A lot of warriors tank with fury spec in end-game dungeons and raids. If your healers are good you need to focus on threat instead of mitigation so you won't bottleneck the damage dealers. Having 11 points in prot for improv shield block is (almost) mandatory though.
---
Time flies. I remember when the #nochanges crew were adamant that anything from 1.1 to 1.12 was legit but absolutely nothing ever that was not in there somewhere could ever be added.
---
Now we've got 1.12 purists who think anything but 1.12 is #changes.
---
I was certain something was correct was convinced otherwise, admitted my mistake and went on with my day. I dont see what else i could  have done apart from jumping into a time machine and change the past. 
---
i also seriously doubt youd have handled the situation with half as much decency judging from your petty treatment of me now. Find something better to do with your goddamn time.
---
It takes total max 30-40 minutes to take a picture of your ID and remove it, not weeks.
---
Will WC3 Reforged include The Frozen Throne? Without it, you can't really continue the story.
---
If you plan on rolling a warrior (like I am), a hunter alt is absolutely perfect.
---
No groups popping at 60? Slightly bored? Take your shit geared hunter to Maraudon (or DM:N if possible) and farm gold at a decent rate.
---
Forced TBC sounds like a bad deal though ;(
---
It could explain why some players performed so poorly back then. With framerates that low it would be very hard to play decently.
---
Ranged rogue.
---
This alone makes me want to roll a healer after playing as a rogue for a very long time...
---
Stay with the first. The price bump is because the i5 vs i7 and plus 8 gb ram. If you want an upgrade get one with gtx 1060 6 gb any i5, ssd and 8 gb ram
---
Im excited about getting spanked and ganked with no mercy. Good times indeed.
---
Jokes aside, one of my friends got an internship and got an email saying that she no longer had one (this was months ago) so she emailed them back and they said "you were not supposed to get that and we are tracking down who sent you that"
---
Yeah, blizzard was actively fucking over interns by not telling them that the internships for everything besides development were shut down
---
Honest, fuck this blizzard, corporate is fucking over the heart and soul of what used to be the premier gaming company on the west coast
---
And then you learn that ass wants blizzard to make mobile games... 
---
My understanding is that ret paladins are not considered top-tier in PvP and are considered dumpster tier in PvE, so giving them a big DPS boost might be what the game needs. But obviously it would need testing.
---
Yes, meele are soakers.
---
You’ll probably having an easier time gearing/grouping as lock, especially alliance side
---
Shut up and tranq shot, it's literally the only reason you are here.
---
Yeah but private servers are big, single servers. These will be more spread out across multiple servers. 
---
Well good luck we got some laws here in Europe 'bout that. They will never take my vacation!!! I'll fight till I'm on a sick leave :)
---
eat a dick!
---
Those people needed to put on their big boy pants and realise that there was no way in hell Blizzard could sell an xpac that only contained content for the Naxx raiding 0.1% of players, nor one that was trivialised by existing Naxx gear. It had to be accessible by everyone with a 60 and have raids that were challenging for people in gear equivalent to T3, which is exactly what it did.
---
[shut up and spam frostbolt](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9uanho/the_official_udragonadept_hall_of_shame/)

Great story lol. Ever have people calling you stuff cause of it? I remember playing Halo and having an Xbox live name "flaming hawk" turns out I didn't know the way "flaming" is used at the time, being  like 13 and all 😂
---
For every data spent, somewhere in the interweb a poor little meme dies.
---
Make a Rogue, gank people at the Crossroads.
---
Single real battlergounds that actually pop constantly &gt;&gt; Cross-realm battlegrounds &gt;&gt; No battlegrounds popping at all.
---
The problem was some servers couldn't even get a match together, which really sucked for people on those servers who were locked out of a major part of the game.
---
Lol what, no. Our guild was far from hardcore and we managed to down half naxx because we just chilled, played for fun and eventually we had the gear for it.
---
How exactly does 3 buffs translates to other healers having no buffs? 
---
It so happens that between 0 and 3 lies 1 and 2. Paladins can only have one blessing up per player, while a shaman can  have 4 totems up for str + wf for melees, mana for mages, +25%armor for tank and +18% healing from 3 stacks. This is a lot more than a paladin can do obviously.
---
Very nice, could easily be worthy of a sidebar link.
---
You do realise that the DPS isn't the problem, the mana is?
---
For some odd reason, it is. Since it's socially acceptable. 
---
Haha, classic!
---
Yeah most guildies called me rim, rimmy or rimmer. Pretty funny. That probably didnt help with the whole 'its not a naughty name thing. Ahh, the good old days. Played on Oceanic servers back then so people just made the connection straight away. Playing on EU this time around so probably won't be as bad, time will tell!
---
Same! Got 4 longtime IRL Friends and our goal is to do every single dungeon together at least once while leveling. I'd love to raid but don't really have the time apart from PUGs and such. So similarly the initial goal for me is to get t0. The working man's Tier.
---
I used to watch him a lot, but i feel he has kinda lost it lately though and keeps saying a lot of stupid things like this and being unreliable with news and reviews etc... He's pretty open about his mental issues though. Hope he gets back on track eventually :p
---
U just nade/tidal or stun/fear/trap the vw at the right time so he cant sac and it becomes useless
---
I didn't encounter 1 person with engineering while leveling on a certain server. I'm talking 90% situations you're going to come out ahead as a warlock
---
I think some people were concerned they may not have oceanic servers, but pretty sure they gotta, right? For latency I guess?
---
Speaking of EU region, I met a dear friend that I've gone to see about 3 times over the last 4 or so years on WoW... I consider him one of my best friends, but yah, he is Swedish and lives in Stockholm. You from Sweden or just like the D&amp;D?
---
I may have it all wrong... outer burbs in Melbourne, maybe it was 300+
---
The first will be plenty to run classic maxed
---
I think I can agree to that.
---
It basically translates the same from PvP. The paladin is just a lo safer than shaman. A shaman relies on other team members to also be good not just about pulling aggro but being genuinely good at the class which includes positioning and prefight behavior. A good tank can easily can have up to 4 pulls on the same totem like in Stratholme as its pretty packed. When you have a noobie tank that runs out of totem range even at the first pull, its obviously futile. Especially as any good shaman puts down his 4 totems after moving up with the remaining mana from the last fight, then sits down to drink and let the warrior do the marking and pulling. A noobie tank will probably always run away and tell his shaman to drink more.
---
This sub gets upset when people bring up non-classic versions of wow (except as an insult ofc), don't take it personally. 
---
Anyway I see no reason why they can't just have fewer but larger servers, reducing the need for cross-realm mechanics. 
---
Well Ony and most of MC I believe can be tanked by any class, even a mage, as long as raid has patience for it. You could never tank as warlock Ragnaros and basically all of bosses from BWL+, except Razorgore maybe. 
---
I think shaman is better tank and shadow priest is probably about as even as warlock, but anyway it is pretty down even in your list.
---
As for stealing aggro during regular raid, this is where warlock is actually worst class, when you steal it, you don't have any mechanic except limited invu. potion.
---
15 days between restores now, fyi. Not sure if it was previously a month but I just restored one yesterday and it told me I must wait 15 more days (well, 14 it said)
---
Why you HEFFFFF to be mad, is only joke.
---
Don’t worry I’ll be staying well away from ERP weirdos
---
i honestly don't know. you might be right. but what if everyone *is* down for that grind? what if that market really has been sitting there waiting?
---
Yeah.. I mean PvP on Oceanic was just awful because of the ping back in the day. Next to impossible to go below 400 back in Vanilla/TBC so world PvP or Arena was hopeless if you happened to be playing against Americans with 30. 
---
Yeah I'm Swedish, lived in Australia for a few years but I'm back in Sweden now. Love that particular edition of Swedish D&amp;d too. I think it was released in English fairly recently too.
---
Thanks!  The Google Doc has even more -- I had to delete a bunch of guides/theorycrafting posts from private server forums to get around the Automod.
---
*Grandpa what does this picture mean?*
---
Depending how classic does I could see them consider older expansions too. 
---
Cute :)
---
BWL = Black Wing Lair, the 3rd 40 man raid content after MC (Molten Core) and Onyxia
---
This is where the Tier 2 set drops (except head, that drops from Onyxia) and lots of other powerful gear. It's a very epic raid dungeon. Although if you play horde warlock, some threat mechanics will be annoying.
---
BWL will not be released at the start however, but in a 2nd phase. I think was before ZG (Zul Gurub).
---
It is a real honour to have my very first crazy stalker, I would like to thank my mother, the academy and of course the morbidly obsessive NEET pirate server community without whom we wouldn't have the the kind of deeply disturbed individuals who get massively over-invested in internet arguments who make all this possible.
---
Of course we need a special shout-out to poor standards in English teaching, because with minimal English skills this idiot wouldn't think it was some kind of personal victory if someone else expresses a preference and that preference is not fulfilled. But as a special present to you I am going to give you yet another "personal victory": I could go a glass of white right now, but the only thing I have open is a red. Dang! I guess you pwned me good.

It is a sad fact that so much of the very valuable work done by embittered neckbeards with no future who sponge off the women in their life while making up pathetic excuses for their own failure is never seen. They labour in the shadows, their creepy posts deleted by mods before anyone even sees them. Like the post I am replying to when I report it, most likely.

July 16 seems more and more real.
---
Is anyone really going to be upset about that? Might as well complain that wall jumping &amp; other exploits aren't going to be in for a limited time
---
I don't know. Did they say anything about population caps? I think it's just one of those things that we still know nothing about. It's funny how they announced a summer release and we still don't know shit about the game. Also I think it's going to be interesting, I can see Black Lotus mafias coming up if dynamic respawns won't be there.
---
Wc3 Reforged is both Reign of Chaos and TFT. Also, since it's built with the same engine, you can actually play custom games and normal matches against people with the original Wc3 + TFT. That's kind of cool.
---
Even at 16 slots how restricting is the debuff limit for warlocks in raids? Is being told not to corruption and just SB spam for more important debuffs common? I played a paladin in vanilla and don't remember really needing to pay attention to those things at the time so I don't remember.

We ( a semi hardcore-PvE guild ) are rolling on a PvP realm for what we call the "full experiance". I bet most people will roll PvP realms. Not sure tho.

Wtf are you talking about flying and dungeon finder in new classic content for, 0% chance of happening.

Not everybody likes world PvP and you need to stop trying to force it onto people because that’s how you think people should enjoy the game.

Outland is designed for flying mounts, if you don’t want to use them because you feel more immersed on a ground mount then don’t use them, but why try force everyone else to play your way.
---
Kargoz reminds me of swifty. Dont know why..
---
Yeah so I'm deciding on warrior Hunter or mage 
---
Warrior pros -can tank and spam dungeons at 60 for bis do gear and help ppl out.
---
Cons-  high gear cap, tanking usually required in some form even if dps, some people think they look like clowns but I like the asthetic of bis fury war.
---
Hunter pros- levels fast as hell looks good in tier and high skill cap
---
Cons: few spots in raid for Hunter, dps drop off at 2.5+, people will make fun of you constantly for being a huntard
---
Mage pros- amazing farmer high dps good pvp, portals
---
Cons: refreshement machine, look like a hobo until high gear, spam 1 button in raids, one of the most played dps class in game (some level mage just for farming as an alt)
---
So seems they all have pros and cons but if it's just from an asthetic point of view Hunter wins but I'll prob still roll warrior to be a mongoloid.
---
Definitely not reusing the names. 
---
Bookmarked. Thanks.
---
Mage is also good in wPvP abd locks are also good in leveling.
---
BM hunter would be my choice too, but in wpvp a non geared hunter will find its limits once everybody else is geared.
---
Might be like a year til aq
---
Dude the hype will be real if we can play WC3 before Classic.
---
Man i'm in a similar point, first it was definitely warlock. Then i played it on ps and I detest the wheelchair playstyle. Then I was deciding between a mage and a hunter, I loved mage when i leveled it with AoE farming and I also loved hunter. Now I've seen some Stormx druid videos and i'm interested in a druid now as well. This is frustrating as hell. I have no idea how to approach this rationally, I don't want to regret my class choice that's the worst.
---
Came to link this, who knew French could sound so badass.
---
They both keep their hair pretty trimmed down! 
---
The Frostadamus edits of the Hurricane trailers are much better. He puts proper WoW music into them &amp; removes unnecessary filler, turning them into actual 'trailers', rather than short movies.
---
Think current Hollywood movie 'trailers'. They are basically just supercuts of the movie, giving away the entire plot.
---
Just a heads up, BeastStalkers set won't be in Phase 1
---
I seriously hope they aren't planning for so few servers... I think there'll be much more interest than that! 
---
Hi, /u/PurplesD3
---
My guild went to 11/15 in Naxx and i cant remember farming consumes for anything but patchwerk progress and Loatheb. I also think this consumable requirement is a bunch of nonsense
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Deep Arcane + frost mage is one of the best dps specs for pve.
---
First of all, sticky this.
---
It is interesting how they chose some of the base and lvl 60 stats for different races. Mostly doesn't matter and just adds flavor but looking over the human vs dwarf paladin is shocking, enough that I wonder if it is accurate.
---
human has:       dwarf has:
---
100 STAM            113 STAM
---
105 STR               122 STR
---
 65 AGI                  76 AGI
---
 70 INT                  29 INT
---
 81 SPIR                44 SPIR
---
Dwarven paladins have 41 less INT and less importantly 37 less spirit??? They also have 130 more hp, 17 more str, 9 more agi. Even Gnomes are like 10 int over the worst int mage class(troll) at 60. 
---
I haven't seen any other discrepancies but if those stats are true that amounts to a difference of 615 mana. So it comes down to sword spec/perception/615 mana vs stoneskin/slightly better melee stats/meme-treasure. I think stoneskin is top 2 or 3 racials in the entire game but PVE is even more one-sided against them with this.
---
TBH you have all the time in the world now to level anything and restart, so I decided to just yolo it, and anyways I'm a huge fan of warrior so I'll play that first than maybe later roll Hunter or mage
---
You have to read it in context. In a way WoW vanilla nearly killed him in his opinion. When he was at hisworst, he was eating himself to death, playing the game all day, every day. The game probably reminds himself of the 10years he will probably die sooner due to his health conditions he acquired while playing vanilla WoW. Having impacted his life so negatively I can imagine, he hates vanilla with a passion.
---
He does not have the scope of the 12year old child marveling at the beautiful game world, he has the scope of the depressed slob who knows deep down that he will eventually die from cardiac arrest if he continues with his downward spiral.
---
The ghost run cut is so fucking great.
---
Its his entausiastic way of talking about the game. And yea the hair is close to 
---
Tears have been shed 😭😍
---
Wasn't he hired by Blizzard the last time I checked? What happened?
---
200$ extra for the second one is not worth it. First one should be able to run **close** to max settings with 60fps ( &lt;= 1920x1080 res), except for in 40man raids but you can just configure ingame to auto turn on medium graphics in raids and ultra/high when outdoors.
---
He's a highly caffeinated man, that enthusiasm has gotta come from somewhere! 
---
Lvl 60-&gt;Ironfoe really
---
I'm going to roll a prot warrior and take my time leveling up. Classic will be a trip down memory lane for me as I started playing around patch 1.7  
---
Was a Resto NE Druid back in the day but this time I wish to take on the role of tank so warrior is pretty much the obvious choice (I've also levelled 4 different warriors in retail). I want to do pretty much all quests, tackling each zone at a time.  
---
Also, this time I want to play it properly. Back in vanilla I had the chance to raid but honestly I was a big noob back then. 
---
This, my buddies and I used to "raid" Deadmines with 10+ lvl 10 characters when we had LAN-parties back then! Great fun but insanely difficult to even get to the instance portal...
---
This gave me chills. I never got to experience Naxx in vanilla since I was too wrapped up in pvp. I want to experience it in all it’s 40 man glory.
---
flying 100% isn't a con
---
As much as this is great I can only assume something like Raidbots is going to update and add a classic version too. Making a class specific one seems to be a bit redundant (and a waste of your time more specifically) if so. 
---
If you only saw that today, you're a little late to the party. 
---
I'll see myself out.
---
Any nay-sayer playing Classic will instantly be drawn to the social aspect of the game. It will make them want to play Classic more than retail I believe. We'll see!
---
An open world rpg and especially an mmo doesn't define being skillful if you can stay dragons. If you are having fun leveling and chatting/creating sub communities and believe you are being skillful at the game. It's about having fun not about some standard a min maxer or turbo nerd tells you.

This alliance guild Holy Warriors were doing Azuregos with 2 or maybe it was 3 raid groups even. So they kill the boss and realize non of their raid groups tagged it. It was an undead rogue. He wore some item Azuregos droped to taunt them and people would applaud him in Ironforge. Guild would be known as Holy Zergers after that event.

---
So what if he's late? You're one sad little person. 
---
I cried again just reading your comment.
---
No flying should be in the pros section, otherwise correct. 
---
Very nice
---
The "there was no RP PvP server on day one launch" is moot because there was no 1.12 patch or sharding on day one of launch.
---
Honestly just put the relevant number in the configuration file for one server in each region to be designated RP-PVP and let everyone be happy.
---
Found my old reddit account to actually login and sub today
---
Would imagine so. 
---
Why would it? Classic is like 4gb going from private servers. You don't need retail installed to play it. 
---
Exactly, lol. Sorry but no. Not resubbing until its time to play.
---
I’m hoping/expecting this to be true. Only a couple more days until we find out.

I am planning to get a hunter at first to level 5 to DE stuff, but then I might eventually get him to 20 for aspect of the cheetah and then 30 for max profession potential. I did not play classic, I came in at the burning crusade so I have been hoping for advice on a second profession. Besides enchanting, what would be useful for a bank alt to learn? Part of me is thinking alchemy for various potions or to transmute, I think elixirs require you to go to certain labs that a level 30 would have trouble accessing, but I am unsure how useful it would be if I have a lvl 30 toon and have to actually do instances/etc to get important recipes/etc. My main would supply most of the matts as it would probably have herbalism since I would be on it most and have opportunities to gather. Any constructive advice would be appreciated. 
---
That poster's a troll. Read the thread. There's not a single Warcraft event scheduled at PAX East, nor Diablo, just Overwatch.

---
Very useful in STV. Let's you know the 3% of the time it's safe to go to rebel camp
---
It's pretty restricting. In low tier guilds there'll be no control, and you'll just have your DoTs pushed off constantly. And in guilds where they understand the limit, they'll have those 16 slots planned out, and only one or two warlocks will be able to use those last slots for corruption. It's understood that if you have any extra room after the important DoTs, more corruptions from warlocks is usually best, but there's rarely much room, and you'll likely just be spamming SB.
---
I was about to say that "meme-treasure" could be the difference between a mount at 40 or a mount at lvl 45, then I remembered you were talking about pallys ...
---
You find some nice green loot in chest, it's nice at lower lvl when you're still in gray / white gear and have barely a few silver to your name.

What d'you mean by wheelchair playstyle? 
---
There was no 1.12 talents at launch or 1.12 AV. They can’t have it both ways. Classic is an amalgamation of ideas and concepts from across vanilla.
---
Speculation: They'll immediately change their minds about #nochanges and implement flying and vanilla wow. Also northrend will be available.
---
Anybody can speculate nonsense. I don't know why people bother posting guesses
---
Please add this amazing video next to Karogoz's. This one is more beginner friendly, and extremely well done. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE
---
That's a smart way of putting it.
---
I always played on PvE servers but once I was on a RP one because I joined a raiding guild which was there to avoid the lag (Rift).
---
We were in good relations with the RP community, a few among us taught us how to respect it, we also joined them in raids when they sometimes asked us for help in filling their rosters.
---
I think the biggest problem is the lack of knowledge about RP, so people who don't RP can be very disrupting even without realizing it, especially when they outnumber you.
---
&gt; I wish every WoW player would at least give it a shot, a surprising amount of people would probably find that they enjoy it quite a lot.
---
I always found RP intriguing but I'm also a bit scared of it because I feel it requires a deep knowledge of the lore that I don't have.
---
The only game in which I played a bit of both was LoTRO, I was on a PvE server and there was a RP server "famous" for organizing big events. They suggested to those from other servers to create one character there to participate, and made their events in a way that didn't leave out low level chars, so everyone could join.
---
I did what they suggested and had a lot of fun that way honestly.
---
I may try something similar on Classic, that is play on a PvE server and create one char on RP to try it and see how it goes.
---
Went on Blizz official forums yesterday, 13 years later, people still bitch about a French guild that opened AQ gates one day before the date they announced (they wanted to avoid the lag).
---
He already was hired but was fired i think
---
So this is the complete dataset of what we used? Weird that we only saw limited data. Thanks for posting.
---
This automated class breakdown, without the differentiation shows a wrong picture regarding paladins and shamans though. You are right that Paladins (and shamans) are not picked as much as other classes overalls. But they are both probably among the top 3 within their faction and that would be the more important (and more correct) info to have.
---
July 16 intensifies
---
In 5-10 mans its very optimal. In raids it falls short a bit as a main tank because of mana issues (which can be solved with extreme determination) and that they cant become uncrushable like the warriors. A lot of people say that missing a taunt is the main problem, but paladins are one of the best threat generators (righteous fury, blessing of salvation), and generally, you should give time to tanks to grab threat. It is still a very good choice for an off tank.
---
I think it's fun to guess and speculate, but you're free to not participate.
---
I remember the one rank14 enha wielding the legendary
---
The announcement has to be soon, right? Summer ends in like 9 months.
---
You dont pick your class based on what youre  going to look like at level 60. Jesus noob.
---
I can't wait for Classic to launch so every1 that shares this opnion is proved wrong 
---
Hope so too. I have to plan my vacation and ff14 shadowbringers is also looming around. This summer will be great with absolutly no sun for me beside the walk to work.
---
Checking later
---
This was on opening ceremony which is free you didnt need the ticket
---
It's actually there already!  Couple entries down, right after the Class DPS/HPS PvE Rankings.
---
Will  check
---
This insanely good. Its nice to highlight the RPG element of WoW. Its so easy to get caught up in the min maxing and numbers, and loot, and guild drama. This is an adventure full of might and magic, and videos like these reinforce that fact/help to see it in that light. 
---
Oh nice, excellent post.
---
Going to sound like a loser with this one, but make lasting friends. Even in an MMO like WoW, I can still be pretty antisocial. I used to have quite a few people that I played with but they've all quit or I've lost touch with them due to being antisocial.
---
Shaman uses most of t3
---
OH, oops, i think it was always 15 days actually, ty for clarifying
---
If the guild has any ambition then yeah
---
I always used addons to get scrolling battle text, so it doesn't matter to me, but I hope you get what you want.
---
Yeah keep telling people how to play a game, I'm sure many people care about how they look while playing something and it's almost as important as a combat animation or even a specific spell animation.
---
Everybody can get a 1.12 client, but what they have is the original source code for the 1.12 server.
---
&gt; summer is already near. 
---
1 Week into Spring and people are going crazy again :)
---
I indeed hope they'll announce something Soon ^(tm.) 
---
Onlt time can tell :)  
---
Id play hunter but I worry I will fail the raid kiting or whatever. And the pet dieing sucks bigly for dps.
---
I'm sorry but those deep dives with TipsOut are absolutely atrocious.
---
Thanks
---
But they can *without* you knowing!
---
Carrot on a stick
---
Depends on the ambition
---
Hunters have a kinda easy time getting preraid gear and they are strong in the first raid tiers
---
open your map? wtf is this shit. just no
---
There were many bits and pieces, I'll quite from this interview with J. Alan Brack (http://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
"Brack says they’re committed to recreating an authentic Vanilla World of Warcraft experience".
---
"This is a game that people have put hundreds and hundreds of hours into and have deep love for, and it’s not something that you can experience today. It’s not something that you’re able to go and play at a Blizzard-quality level, and that’s what we want to deliver."
---
"it doesn’t matter what I think because once we’re committed to doing this at a Blizzard level, which we are, whatever happens is going to happen. If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way. What’s important to us is that we have this Classic experience people can enjoy, that people do have the opportunity to go back to. This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important."
---
Also, if you take account of what will be "changed", you can see that basically nothing. They'll use their new 64 bit client (and server/infrastructure) which brings some superficial changes, like colorblind options, some improved graphics options, better performance, etc. They'll have right click reporting, loot trading, sharding (likely) and Battle.net integration. These are all things which, although they might be important to the overall experience and some people might feel very strongly that these are big changes which make Classic not Vanilla, are still incidental to gameplay. The changes are for Blizzard to successfully launch and operate the game in their current situation.
---
But their goal is to bring back the original gameplay and graphics. They go to great lengths to make that happen. They have an original 1.12 client/server set up in-house to check everything. There might be some additional small changes, like a tooltip for item comparison or mail being instant, instead of taking 1 hour. There will be unintentional differences (bugs) too, I'm sure. It's a monumental task but their goals are clear. Here is the Blizzcon 2018 panel about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
There is also the ClassicWoW page about what we know, there are links to all publicly available information: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
I played till Cataclysm and never leveled fishing beyond 10/75. Now I can see myself entering the Booty Bay competition.
---
Thanks! I gotta hand it to them, that cinematic is incredible. The expansion doesn't do it justice.
---
You won't make it past lvl 30.
---
and lets ban people when they make a photo or video from their screen  
---
The 2000's are over now. We are almost 2 decades further in time and everybody who can play classic can install capture software, or press the screenshot button :D
---
i will now press the screenshot button 500 times every hour.
---
you need the BFA launcher, so pretty sure, that the requirement 
---
Honestly he's not wrong, i really think this is how most people will react when trying it. The people I know who still play retail won't like classic.
---
Shaman is healer 99,99% of the time  
---
Real PVE guild will only have 1 DPS shaman in Raid.  
---
cassual raids maybe will accepts you.  
---
Just ask yourself, what kind of guild you are joining and from there on, you can make the judgement what kind of Shaman you play
---
in essence, this is the correct answer
---
I am planning to roll an alliance warlock for classic, but I have troubles choosing my class: I hesitate between a human and a gnome. I really prefer the human over the gnome in terms of look but I also see that the gnome racials are really good, that 5%int and moreover the slow breaker (I am planning to play on a pvp serv and that could help I think)  what are your thoughts ? Gnome or human ? 
---
I suggest you never wanted classic back because you want classic, but because you want new/re-released content.  
---
I have been playing vanilla constantly since beta.  I have swapped realms but in almost every case it was forced and NOT because I was bored or finished with content.  You severely underestimate how long it will be before even 50% of the population has end game r13+ or Naxx gear.  Sure some will do that within a couple of YEARS, but thats the hardcore players and even they will still have only done it on a single class.  
---
I think realms should be static, as a preservation project.  Should Blizzard decide to do ANYTHING after classic those original realms should remain for eternity.  If players choose to progress thats fine, but at this stage we have no idea if there will be anything at all after classic.
---
Haha seeing as I've made it to 60 twice in vanilla and once on nostrils I'm pretty sure I will. No one like someone who's being as toxic as you are.
---
Sorry to say that Lake but you lost all vision of classic. How did we decide which class to play back then? It was how the class looked, how the animations worked, how it feelt in general. Min-maxing was out of question even playstil didn't realy matter. I can heal with the druid? Cool, didn't know that. A bear to tank? Awesome! Everyone was a noob once so it isn't a real insult. Being an elitist prick on the other side ...
---
I have never heard anyone suggest flying in WoW was fun... Flight paths are fun. Flying is not fun. At all.
---
Doing Blacksmithing and Mining equally along levelling so I can craft and use my own gear. Always wanted this, and it's quite a challenge especially on a fresh server. Slows you down significantly but let's you "smell the flowers" a bit more. Plus running around mining is such a calm activity, perfect for listening to audiobooks
---
Yep that’s him! Ha small world. I was always his guest on Xbox Live and for some reason I remember your name
---
But what Classic WoW, do I have to give in return?
---
dude just grow up
---
Oh there is grinding in Vanilla WoW. Make no mistake about that. 
---
Only this time it's a grind for leveling, or for reputation with a faction for a key, enchanting recipe, or some item you want. 
---
However, you're absolutely right, there's no "You gotta do this quest every day, but *only* every 24 hours" idiocy.
---
We had a mage in our raid that aimed for full t1. We didn’t mind, MC goes on farm the same week you start raiding. It was pretty cool to see a full t1 mage with Headmaster’s Charge. When Classic rolls around I’ll probably enter MC with full T0 lol.
---
However at some point you’ll have to accept the fact that tier sets are pretty bad. Healers and Tanks are less impacted by this. T1 is pretty much wholly outclassed by pre Raid BiS unfortunately. I’m pretty sure Robes of the Exalted have like half the amount of +healing than an entire T1 set for instance.
---
I guess it all depends on class, spec and Guild. I’m in the mindset that while Tier sets are not the best they serve as an excellent “baseline” for most playstyles.
---
Thats the point. 
---
My personal fave remains Karazhan, I just loved that place, and I'm really looking forward to seeing ZG again. I personally preferred 10- and 25-man raiding over the 40-mans that predominated in vanilla and TBC.
---
That said, although I never saw Naxx in vanilla I really enjoyed the rebooted Naxx in early Wrath. I hope that in Classic more people get to experience end-game raiding than the first time around. I'll be happy to see Ony and MC and BWL again.
---
If u play a popular class u may have to try a bit harder to be better than most casuals
---
You want to farm more gold for bis boes and consumables cuz if u perform well then u dont worry
---
That’s the point
---
Iirc the nost forums had class stats somewhere for 60 only
---
During the European Launch there where no Spanish servers, only English. So, prior to release, once the server list was anounced, the spanish community, through forums and the means we had back then, coordinated to all go to the Spinebreaker server (as spine sounds like Spain) with Aggamagan being  the second "spainsh" server. It was for all intents  and purposes (aside talking to GMs) a spanish server all vanilla long, until they opened spanish realms close to 2.0 patch, and blizzard allowed free migration from Spinebreaker and Aggamaggan to those new realms.
---
If there is indeed, no RP-PVP server at launch, your best bet is to make noise in all the media available today (reddit, forums, discord, etc..) and designate one server once theserverlist is released  as the Unofficial RP-PVP server for all the community to go to. If it gets full (thus showing there is interest on it) Blizzard may make and official one and open migrations, like it did to us back then.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. TipsOut should not be quoted as a credible source for anything.
---
There are always games with lower system requirements that will play with higher framerates. When I could not get high enough framerates in a game, I would choose to play a different game where I could get reasonable framerates.
---
I was in my early 20s, so I able to pay for my own PC upgrades back then. I never had a top end rig, but I was able get by. I had upgraded my graphics card in 2004 since my framerates in Doom 3 would often drop well below 40. This probably helped me a lot in WoW.
---
I had a bunch of gamer friends and it's very possible we just had generally better hardware than most WoW players. 15 FPS gaming simply didn't exist for us.
---
We're working on the final draft, and we'll still be improving it right up to launch day! But it can be released in rough form pretty much anytime now. We'll be using the time left available to clean it up, make improvements and to flesh out the steps so they are easily followed.
---
Joana I believe he will have an alliance one out but I am confident ours will be better, because we've worked on it for two years and made some massive improvements from playtesting; he hasn't tested his yet.
---
I'll DM you once it's out!
---
Well i guess you were pretty fortunate since engineering probably is the most used proffesion over all on most pservers. Even when it was completely fresh i had iron grenades before lvl30. I've leveled multiple characters and i always have engineering from level20+ since i am very aware it is essential in pvp. 
---
You can gouge / trap / intercept / cheap / fear etc the vw still tho, doesn't require engineering and is very common knowledge.
---
Most guilds will simply be desperate to fill the 40 man in the first place
---
Even the good raiders quit the game or change guilds and someone has to replace them.
---
Druid and warlock for the easiest time
---
Kid, we aren't talking about Twinks. If you pull two mobs early on and don't crit you are dead. 
---
 That was some crazy shit.
---
nice, pity that a lot of them are videos rather than visual guides, but great amount of resources for classes nonetheless. do you have any for tbc by chance?
---
Still raids only bring like 3
---
did you actually frame a screenshot from a videogame when you are fishing? I love wow but this sub is getting really weird now lol
---
Some people are so choked and mad about vanillia its funny 
---
I forget the guys name, but the software engineer who talked at the beginning of the blizzcon classic panel said he started working on wow in 2003. I'm sure there are other old timers still there. I don't know Activisions corporate structure, but it was a merger. They didn't just buy the blizzard's IP and lay off everyone.
---
Our guild will Roll on RP-PVP, but if not available just regular PVP.
---
I'd also like to reccommend the youtuber Ohhgee's videos, which have some pretty great PVP advice. I haven't seen much content around from a PVP perspective either. Standouts:

Prolly not gonna use my reddits
---
Did it once and the raid struggled to call me in voice lol. Sometimes not a bad idea tho if u want less responsability.
---
Picking a generic real name now
---
fml this is awesome. I feel like I'm fully prepared for launch
---
Rogues? They dont really flask cuz it doesnt boost dps and they dont chug a bunch of mana pots.
---
Meh, I dont have the energy to convince you or the other idiot why choosing your class based on "who gets to use their tier sets" is stupid. 
---
You must consider this: with Private Servers the barrier of entry is higher than Classic. Once Classic comes around there’s (hopefully) going to be a steady stream of casual or interested players, which will keep leveling populated. I also don’t believe Vanilla is supposed to live years after Naxx release, the game needs more content naturally.
---
Classic wont be as casual as it was
---
All the online guides posted since are raising the bar
---
I think a better alternative would be for the guilds that want an RP-PvP server to get together all in the same RP server and simply establish permanent pvp flag on at all times as a rule for their members. 
---
Enough guilds do that (and there *will* be enough of them) and we'll have a decent enough wPvP experience.
---
I have just watched 2 hour deep dive on rogues and his guest was a guy and I quote "one of the best hardcore rogue players in the world"... on private servers. All of the numbers and drop rates, including gold farming, mats farming and BiS farming where based on private server statistics. It was very hard to take them seriously.
---
&gt;ll. I was just pointing to the data that is closer to what Blizzard might have.
---
It kinda ruins the immersion when suddenly "Frostymagexx" and "Imashamanlol" shows up to gank you in the world. The name enforcing on RP-PVP is more important than most people give it credit for.
---
It's kinda funny that you go out of your way to say you aren't subbed to asmon.  
---
I understand he isn't popular amongst some people, personally I find him kinda funny people take him way too seriously, it's all for show, but seriously who cares if some random online thinks you like asmongold?
---
mind to share why you think that?
---
Wow, this questline was quite an ordeal. I never did anything but upgrade the bracers for my dungeon set but this might be a nice goal for my non-raiding self this time around.
---
What does wheelchair playstyle mean sorry?

---
If the raid is on farm meaning u prolly overgear it then yeah
---
Palas wont even drink mana pots
---
Hidrasactum was a pain, always dying to those dots during hillsbrad battles, XD you knew it was a loss when facing him/her in wsg or ab. 
---
Lol. Did I say anything about twinks? And whi is we? You by yourself here. Coming out with your chest puffed up.
---
Scrubbbbbbb
---
If your priority is playing being dps in raids, you should really roll a pure dps class. Otherwise youre just going to have too many dramas finding a guild that will take you. 
---
I don't, sorry.
---
Paladin needs good intel gear first
---
I learned how good human rogues with swords are compared to other races with daggers so ill try that out.
---
Did you level on a fresh server that has just started? I seriously doubt that people will spend money on the AH since now we have way much more information about loot and how to get it compared to 15 years ago.
---
Oh yeah, he's great!  I actually already have his PvP Class Picking Guide up there, third down from the top.  Probably my favorite class overview video of the bunch
---
Yeah I saw it pretty much as soon as I posted this comment haha. The other videos are still really informative though.
---
Behind you!
---
WRYYYY?
---
I'm just hoping the Classic WoW team had been able to go back to the old Blizzard way of releasing games "when it's done", and not on a set time that will make some things rushed and buggy.
---
They are, yeah.  Since most of his videos aren't class-specific, I decided not to include them in this list.  I'll put in the one about Class Insignias, though, since it fits with the overall goal of the list.
---
I mean for me personally it's probably one of my favorite and a lot of fun because I love RNG and gambling aspects in games.
---
A lot of this could very well become outdated, in some parts, or incorrect but it is nice regardless. 
---
Shun the casual
---
Yes warrior
---
Unless you will tank for ur preraid bis
---
Most warrs will struggle to get preraid bis cuz they dont tank and preraid bis lasts you through mc bwl hell even zg?
---
Can this be pinned?
---
&gt; Charisma can arguably be more important than performance
---
charisma meaning kissing the ass of the people that distribute the loot
---
Yeah, there is that risk.  In the Google Doc, there are a few private server guides that are pre 1.12, which I've marked as outdated (but I wanted to include them, since they still have a ton of valuable info). I'll try to keep this list updated as best I can after release.
---
Little bit aggressive towards blizzard. They've done a good job of listening to feedback thus far, I'm sure they'll address the rp pvp issue, as there is a demand for it. 
---
Yeah this. We had 1 horde pvp group and 2 alliance ones. We were pvping 24 hours a day just rotating members but there was always a few core members there. one hunter managed to pull off 1m honor 1 week. Really insane stuff.
---
The real pain were Chinese farmers. They would play your character 247 so we had to out pvp them by rolling ab/wsg non stop 12 hours+ per day. At rank 13 it was 3 weeks to hit rank 14 if you had standing 1 every week. If you hit standing 2 because of a Chinese farmer it meant you had to sink another 100 hour week into bgs.
---
Meh as if there are any secrets anymore lol
---
imagine being secretive about this ancient game lol
---
It's a bit of a joke :) And I agree, they've done a very good job so far listening to the community. And hopefully, they'll do it just this one last time before release.
---
Well if your server was lopsided with very long queues then that might happen for your side.  Meanwhile anyone with instant queues or &lt;15 mins where the queue pops before you even reach the end of the flight path would not bother with world PvP anymore.  I remember post-honor launch pre-BGs there would be literal groups of 60s roaming plaguelands with spontaneous group PvP battles.  That died out quickly (along with SS-TM being very much reduced) after release of BGs.  Instead you got mostly just people still leveling and occasionally some 60s that were heading for dungeons or a rare ganker.  If that didn't happen on your server that is great but it did on the two servers I primarily played on back in vanilla.
---
I think reddit in general is a weak reflection of the real world
---
so many radical edgelords on this website while outside it isnt really like that
---
PC Police will come and get them. Doubt they'll be re-added. 
---
Just keep shilling, just keep shilling.
---
Yes, the "scrolling combat text" addon, which included that animated character portraits.
---
&gt; I always found RP intriguing but I'm also a bit scared of it because I feel it requires a deep knowledge of the lore that I don't have.
---
You don't really need to have deep knowledge of the lore. Just having cursory knowledge of the main plot of the RTS games should be enough (First two games can literally just be summed up as "Orcs invade from the Dark Portal and sack Stormwind. Orcs invade further north but are beaten back. Alliance invades Draenor and orcs accidentally blow their own planet up.). Our characters aren't all knowing. It's not like they have Wikipedia and internet in Azeroth so they can instantly learn stuff about whatever subject they want. Let's say your play an orc warrior and RP a young orc who wants to prove himself and earn glory for the Horde. You'll know how Thrall and Grom Hellscream are. But why would that character even know who, say, Arthas and Illidan are? If you're not too confident in your knowledge of the lore, just play an appropriate character. 
---
If you want to play something less mundane and go with, say, human mage, then it would help to take a quick look at Wowpedia articles for mages and magic just to see the basic theory of how magic works in Warcraft and what type of magic your character uses, etc. but even that's only really necessary if you plan on getting involved into theoretical debates about magic with other magic users in-character in-game. If you're not familiar with a subject you can just avoid talking about it. And even if you do get some things wrong, it's not like people will crucify you for it, I imagine Classic will have RP addons and you'll just be able to install one and make a note saying you're new to it all.
---
thorns is probably the best dps buff in the game and you might be able to do mob pulls in pairs with your pet using thorns. But then a bear tank would benefit more drom a healing who uses ret aura or magma totem while they pull big packs and spam aoe.
---
Yes please. I would love to play through the campaign(s) again to hype myself up lore-wise before Classic hits.
---
Good to hear nice work man :-)
---
I'm sure someone has said this but the only reason a dps getting agro would be bad is because if you're split onto 2 different sides of a dragon so you dont get tail swiped or fire breathed.  the tanks would have the dragon in a good way where the tail wouldn't hit anyone and their fire breath would only hit them (if they had fire breath) when a dps pulls agro and he turns the dragon the tail can smack the other dps group and he can now fire breath another group
---
60k is not too shabby at all. Granted, a small portion of those may be subscribed on here just to get up-to-date news and may not be in for the long run. But if we do a rough estimate;
---
If Blizz makes realms have a cap of 2500 as was rumored to be in Vanilla, that means for 60k people, we'd need a minimum of 24 realms, all full to the brim.
---
Even if less than 60k people from here would constantly play, we're still looking at *AT LEAST* 10 full realms at all times, either 2500 or 3000 pop cap.
---
This is why I think closer to launch, we should just make a huge poll or something and we could all roll on for example the first 10 realms from top to bottom sorted by name or something. This way you definitely know you'll be with the majority of fellas from here.
---
Inb4 name calling and ganking become the #1 posts, lmao
---
rly ?
---
Well other than not thinking rogues and mages don't really need any nerfs, I would be ok with using prior data to bring up some other specs as long as its done tasetfully
---
I used to park something in the winterspring to get cheap gromsblood or what was it called
---
it was a problem getting there tho .. maybe get friends to summon you there or just walk dead to the rezzer near the base? invis pots help for the cave but u still gonna die a lot 
---
People here are barely coming around to TBC let alone Wrath. Wrath also didn’t launch with the dungeon finder. I remember spending weeks full clearing all of the heroics wit my guild daily before it was implemented. It wouldn’t be too out of character for wrath to be released without the dungeon finder.
---
That being said, I loved wrath because it finally made healers interesting since they could do effective damage rather than being relegated to simply sustaining the party and seeing how much trash could be pulled without dying. It made things more interesting from then on when it came to healer involvement. I hope that classic grows to include expansions like Wrath in some capacity.
---
\&gt;  Diablo: Immortal to PC 
---
Based on that, i cannot believe anything on that list.
---
But i do think they dont have many other places to give out the info to large media coverage. 
---
And how long have you been in the private scene? The fresh meme is literally the post nost community. Realm before that period lasted years not months. People didn’t quit because only 1500 peaks, the dead server memes.  Please link me a character you own in full t3 that you got bored with. 
---
Some players want stability and security, it’s why we have been trying to get a legitimate version for years
---
He brings on some high profile private server players that obviously know the game, and then he spends 2 hours asking the most basic and worthless questions. It's like sifting through 2 hours of shit hoping to find gold, but all you find is a discount coupon that is probably expired.
---
Nah even druids got a talent overhual, innervate used to be the 31pt resto talent etc, till the reworked the trees.
---
with a slow one-hand + WF + FW/LS + Oil you could do some nice damage in melee but that would mean that you don't use a +spell power weapon and +spell power enchant.
---
You could go with something like [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uV0GqoxVf0V](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uV0GqoxVf0V) for a mix of melee and spell damage or a resto build to give you more survivability 
---
I saw this post and scrolled right to the Rogue because while I'm adept at Warrior, my knowledge of Rogue is relatively shallow, but TipsOut's video would do absolutely zero to help me get deeper based on his 2 hour deep dive on the Warrior.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head there. I have played every retail expansion so far and it's become so gimmicky. They add new features and systems in every expansion which are only truly fleshed out in the new expansion but they are usually left behind in some form or another (read archeology, pet battles, ...). At the end of the day you are left with so many features, half of them meaningless and just confusing to both new and veteran players. Add to this the new stuff with BfA where you do Island Expeditions for X, Warfronts for Y and you're just left with a confusing theme park. BfA looks really nice, the zones, dungeons and leveling 110-120 are really amazing. But you have like 5 buttons you actually use for your class since they pruned so much when taking away artifacts. I tried BfA as well, didn't like it either and now I eagerly await the classic launch with you.
---
I guess you would just bomb the Netherwing since 
---
1. They are on an island
---
2. What would we get out of their existence without flying mounts?
---
3. Why have that series of race quests when you don’t actually need to fly outside of them
---
Surely I’m not the only one. People got married in-game after all..
---
I have absolutely no experience as a beartank and I don't I recall us using one in vanilla so take this with a a grain of salt but just off the top of my head... Not being able to proc windfury strikes me as a massive disadvantage for horde bears vs the standard warrior tank.
---
On horde, warriors get WF, dont think bears gain anything from it. Making Warriors much closer so druid threat just based on that extra buff.
---
Why not? It's still an experience, be it fishing out in the real world on a lake with his same friend, or fishing within the game. You're still spending real time and thought and enjoying yourself and the company.
---
*Fun* has no bounds or forms. You just have it. And you ain't livin' if you ain't havin' no fun.
---
Also if OP is a dad, he could try to joke-show this photo to his newborn and keep showing it to him as he's growing up until one day the child goes "Now hold on wait a minute dad!"
---
r/wow
---
From my experience druid is probably your best bet for duo level as hunter. They're able to spec for shred and spam shred every mob since you will have agro. This is huge because come classic you can't front shed giving the druid an advantage over all the solo druids. Also, Motw and thorns on you and your pet are huge. Along with innervating you off cd. I think it synergies super well from my experience and would for sure recommend it. 
---
A lot more I didn't go over but if you have more questions feel free to ask!
---
As far as we know, it will be under the same play button in battle.net (as the commentors pointed out). The install for WoW is 70gbs.
---
We had a bear tank back then. Not as mt and not from the start though. We equiped him from AQ40 onwards and he did pretty good. But I also played alliance with anti fear dwarf buff. I don't realy know how much trouble you will have as a horde druid. As alliance it was viable. Maybe not the best (we didn't min max back then) but still viable.
---
Interesting. My job requires me to be working the moment I get in to the moment I leave and I still don't have enough hours to get everything done hah.  
---
I do work from home two days a week though, might be able to pull off some shenanigans there..
---
I thought RP stand for Roleplaying and not ganking gankers in world pvp.
---
Does anyone have a raid roster/makeup spreadsheet for classic? [WoWaudit.com](https://WoWaudit.com) would be incredible if it had a classic version. Thinking about reviving an ancient 40 man and I forgot how our old spreadsheets looked.
---
I'm with ya, however I don't think they need to do the same damage as a fury warrior to be a valued raid asset, they def need a damage buff but it would have to be done extremely carefully if they don't want to fuck up pvp entirely I would much rather look at improving their group buffs. For example if ret did even remotely close damage to warrior who would play warrior in pvp? Hybrid tax needs to be kept or otherwise pure offensive classes wouldn't be fun at all to play, but thats not to say they couldn't make some changes to bring the hybrid specs more in line or give them additional group utility to make up for their dps.
---
Thank you!
---
Finally got a new PC on the weekend in anticipation of release and I’ve been wanting to knuckle down and do some reading about classes and such.
---
Legend.

WoW Classic Class Picking Guide, by MadSeasonShow (not long enough)
---
&gt;Not if you play a hunter.
---
Meaning you dont have any movement enhancing abillities outside of external sources. So like hunter has cheetah, mage has blink, druids have travel and catform speed and sprint.
---
Classic is not vanilla. People keep mixing these up.
---
Working at blizzard isn't a dream job. They use their popularity to lure unsuspecting employees into working below industry standard pay.
---
I tried going to Winterspring with a lvl 1orc warrior. Abandoned in Felwood since I was camped by the mobs on the nothern graveyard : run 10 meters die, wait 2 min, run 10 meters die ... not possible imo.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djzrjTyJsPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djzrjTyJsPI) is probably the best feral druid I've ever seen and you can see just how much more work he needs to put in to get kills.
---
Enh shaman isn't awful, it just has hugely lopsided matches and needs a ton of gear. Mages, warlocks, priests and solo warriors it can do quite well against.
---
Paladin's great as a pvp healer, just not great at dps.
---
In general, non-combat rogues, frost. mages, affl. warlocks are top tier. combat rogues, destr locks, priests are high tier. hunters, holy paladins and ele shamans are mid tier. Everything else is low tier.
---
Aye, I am aware that Pre-AQ MTing is pretty viable, even optimal in some fights, afterwards MT is doable but better to be OT.
---
Im glad we synergise well together since these are only classes we wanna play.  What about our synergy in pvp ? Thank you for all ^^
---
This is without a doubt early Warsong(US). I recognize many of the players here.
---
Seems like the same principle as with StarCraft: Remastered.
---
Does warrior generate substantially more threat because of WF? If so then indeed alliance seems to be a better pick.
---
Blizzard lures people in using their popularity and brand recognition to trick people into working below industry standard pay.
---
"It's such an honor and privledge to get to work at blizzard. We don't need to pay you."
---
That seems to be the consensus here. Thanks for the reply!
---
Yes for retail. Not for classic. Live, PTR, and beta have all been separate installs until recently (if not still, don't know if or when that change is coming) and with them using a different (7.3.5) base game I don't think they'll be able to just use lives 8.x - whereas a ptr or beta can work on top and change it. 
---
Rogues had their talent overhaul, but by the time everyone else had theirs and weapons speed normalized they really weren't the pvp monsters they had been previously, and are mostly designated to camp a flag in wsg or ab.
---
Not to say buffing hunters and enh isn't a decent goal, I just don't think they should be doling out nerfs or we might end up with 1.4 warlocks pre DC buff lol
---
We would need an actual release date to have a countdown.
---
I know, I feel like I have wasted 2 hours watching a video about rogues claiming to be preparation for classic but the rogue never actually played on an official blizzard server and it's really hard to find credability in his videos.
---
Druid also a great fit for world pvp 2vX because they can heal you when needed, open on someone out of stealth when the enemy think you're solo, hard to lock down the druid so they dont have a good target (Picking between focusing a hunter or a druid blows in open world because both targets aren't great targets), synergy kiting, etc.
---
Theoretically, there is no 2v2 hunter druid should lose in open world since you guys can out drain and out kite everyone (This comp is nuts in TBC arena 2s). The toughest matchup is Warlock/healer but early on warlocks are squish so hunters kinda win it, sometimes you will barely die to dots after though.
---
Yes.
---
Who doesn't find its limit when you are in blue against T2.5/T3?
---
You guys think that people will play it the same way as back when it was just released?
---
Will there ever again be legends about the plague,  players getting one of a kind mounts and pvp gods having their name recorded in wow history?
---
Do you think that blizzards will allow similar events to happen and embrace them instead of patching them away?
---
I would argue the vanilla experience was change, people stuck with one class because you just KNEW in your heart of hearts you were getting your talent rework next and you couldn't wait, and it led to a much more diverse playerbase people who stuck with their class through thick and thin. Now with hindsight its gonna be very difficult for anybody who is playing the game seriously to play these classes unless they really like healing.
---
Take shaman for example, they waited the entirely of vanilla for a talent rework that never came, they basically had 1 viable pve spec and 1 viable pvp spec and the pvp spec doesn't really come online until you have AQ gear. You have to REALLY like shaman (or healing) to say im willing to play resto for a year until I can be a good pvp class.
---
Only 1-2 hunters should get tier 2 and the rest should get full tier 1.
---
Allowing a hunter to go from full tier 1 to full tier 2 is a waste of gear. 
---
Druid is also low gear dependent and are decent in wpvp &amp; farming.
---
Hunter/druid is an amazing combo. Druids have strong cc to keep people away from the hunter. You have innervate to give the hunter freedom to do whatever and you can root people who get into melee of the hunter. On top of that the druid can offheal the hunter. Me and my wow mate a going hunter&amp;druid for this exact reason :) 
---
Try to stop thinking in term of viable, and more in terms of fun
---
I would agree with you that developing new content would be the most exciting route after naxx has been out for a while. However, I disagree on the leveling part. I think people should stay at level 60 and blizzard should release new content based on what players want. This should not necessarily be new raids but could also be new factions or zones or battlegrounds. 
---
If they should add new raids the gear should be  comparable to naxx gear and not much powerful. I think they should focus on making either a 40 man raid with just different loot that could be regarded as sidegrades instead of upgrades. Maybe add some flavorful items in the vanilla spirit to give people more ways to optimize their character.
---
I also think that their should be a more efficient way of getting PvP gear other than the ranking system. Many people love PvP but cannot invest the time and resources to getting all the way to rank 14. Maybe they could add another BG with another faction so you can get more gear just from grinding BG's. Maybe they could add more gear to existing bg vendors. They could also make a new way of grinding gear in PvP. This gear would obviously need to be inferior to r14 gear.  
---
All in all I think it will depend greatly on the popularity of classic and this topic should be at least 2-3 years down the road. I also firmly believe that the developers would have to look at community feedback whenever they add or change something in classic. Maybe they could do a similar system as OSRS where they get ideas for new changes, post the entire plan online and then players can vote on whether or not they like this plan (and specific parts of it). For example they would say we add a new dungeon where you can fight monster x and train skill y and get an item that will be better than item z. And then players can vote yes/no to adding the dungeon, to adding a new way to train a skill and to get a drop that would be better than existing stuff, in 3 different polls. I also think new features need a 2/3 majority to be implemented (not sure). This system works great for that game but I'm not entirely sure if it will translate to classic.  
---
All this is just my two cents and I would love to read your thoughts.
---
Request for sticky to mr. mod abuse /u/Soupasouka
---
Your Alterac Valley actually links to Arathi Basin
---
Yup this, its at most 188 days (sep 30th) though, so at least we can work with that one. one 
---
About 5go
---
I think you have your classes backwards there, soldier.
---
Ehh. It's a sign of the times. Video-editing was thing that was much too complicated in the 90's/early 2k, but then both the hardware and software let novices do whatever they wanted, so you got a lot of experimental stuff.  This is quite tame, in comparison.
---
Since you say you dont going to raid its perfectly fine to tank as a pala, be sure to get some water (or a mage as watertank) and you will have no problem in doing those 5 a 10 man dungeons. I will go for a paladin aswell when classic hits and with the following build [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo).
---
With this build y can heal almost as good as a raid healer, you only miss 5% crit. You can AoE grind mobs and tank dungeons all the way up to UBRS. And y got some pvp talents that makes you good at healing with a 2hander for some reckbombs once in a while. No respec cost and a free mount so you will swim in money :D.
---
Blizzard is looking forward to the classic release so that they can compare/contrast it against the modern version. From the frequently positive blue posts regarding the content phases, battlegrounds (AV), and loot tables - it does look like we will be playing a genuine classic experience. 
---
Thank you sir, god's work right there
---
Printing money just leads to inflation, so your still gonna end up either farming the consumes yourself or paying sombody an exorbitant amount of money because they value their time too.
---
Good job at misspelling “Faction”.
---
Just because they play on private servers doesn’t mean you can’t take them seriously. 
---
Thanks for the great answer! 
---
Say, would herb/ench be worth going with at launch? Keeping ench just for the sake of DE till 60, and then switch for tailoring; after which go for alchemy for the end result? or would that be too much?
---
Only time will tell how much I'm able to play, but 2-3h a day seems reasonable at the moment. Do want to join a consistantly raiding guild.
---
Assuming there are enough roleplayers to provide a healthy Realm population, I agree.
---
it is possible to run as soon as you created your character.
---
what is easier in your opinion? mostly people move, because some starting zones will be super crowded.
---
I'm hopeful for a release date by the end of the week with pax east 
---
you die
---
and you run to rez near everlook instead
---
then on the way to the cave you can avoid much of the aggro or only die a few times
---
for the last part after the bridge u just bring a cheap invisibility potion
---
10g an hour on deviate fish! i have 50g currently at level 30
---
He's right in the sense that it wasn't required then, but it certainly will be now. Mindsets have changed, expectations have been raised. Even in low end guilds (I'm talking heroic guilds of live) they still require consumables and enchants. The same thing will apply in classic.
---
The difference in potential is huge. Tanks don't even have to wear shields all the time these days because potions give the same armour (2k) as a shield - that means more dps and thus threat from the tank and a lot more raid dps. For the sake of a potion.
---
Nah
---
I agree here, it's always drama and not a credible opinion
---
Ah ok I see what you mean there, makes sense.
---
Do you think Blizz will start to balance classic independently, meaning crappy classes might get pvp buffs?
---
&gt; Bear Form Quest Guide, by Tips Out

Ah, finally thank god someone made the level 10 bear form guide!
---
wowzors! very cool

that shouldnt be the standard tho lol

Nice! Thanks a bunch, excited to see it. Best of luck

Quest rewards are  good enough
---
I read in comments that he left the job wasnt fired my bad
---
IMO, go human if you prefer the looks. Personally I'd be much happier to have my character the race I want than play a race I don't like as much just get a very minor advantage. 
---
If you really want to min/max gnome is slightly better. Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7qutjz/human_caster_how_much_of_a_disadvantage_is_it/) thread for more info.
---
nope
---
IIRC you couldn't rez at another graveyard in Classic. 
---
Indeed, on the demo, I thought crit rate was too low, because I rarely noticed crits.
---
And, no changes. If people want changes, they'll install an addon that brings WoD texts.
---
The F is silent.
---
get out of town
---
Silent letters still appear in text.
---
That's just one of the problem with tourists. Server population and faction balance are two other problems they have to work out.
---
I think the problem there is that ALL the melee dps will gain WF (including tank) so their threat generation is greatly increased. But druid tanks isnt. On alliance you get the same increases as everyone else, so relatively you are much, much stronger on alliance.
---
https://classicwowguides.com/ is a pretty good write up on leveling grinding spots
---
The second one might get like 5% more FPS, that's it. But even the first one should run classic above 100 fps probably, considering it's Vanilla graphics on a more efficient game engine.
---
Are you really asking that question in this sub?
---
We will be picking druid and hunter whether they are strong or not , but why not to learn their capabilities tho
---
Droid tier 2
---
Ya no WF for druids cat or bear. Yes they produce more threat than warriors on average however, ally has salvation so it’s not how much threat it’s the difference between your threat and your dps’s threat. 
---
Haha have fun in your elitist guild if you have one trying to min max if that's fun for you, but it's not fun for the majority of people who are going to play wow and based on your attitude you are going to limit yourself to just 40 people on an entire server. To be frank no one likes a toxic asshole, but everyone likes to have fun.
---
Yeah, that is an excellent guide.  Since it's not specifically a resource about a particular class (or about learning classes in general), I've opted not to include it here--mostly so I don't get overwhelmed.  There's oodles of other non-class resources out there (levelling, professions, etc.), and including all of them here would just be too much work.
---
This I like man, but I don't want to drag ppl down because I want to look cool so I'd prob show up to raid in bis and in world I'd rock tier if I played a class that tier wasn't bis
---
It's a silent text.
---
Okay fair enough :p
---
I wanted this list to be useful for players at all levels of experience.  Some stuff here is bound to be old news for veteran players.
---
We had a bear tank offtanking when we started raiding MC and ZG, he did really well and we found him extremely useful against for example Garr (could tank ALL of them at the same time taking very little dmg).
---
Druid tank / offtank is very viable and sometimes even good. But having a prot warrior as main tank is ofc prefered.
---
Not a chance dude. 
---
Yeah man. OSRS is great.  Put in hard work for a reward. Ya know.  PM me if u decide to make an account 
---
Imo warlock sets are some of the best looking in the game
---
By the time this set is released any active raider will have better gear than T0.5 but no matter what I will try to complete it. Just for the sake of an epic quest.
---
It's a lot of running around but it's on par with Onyxia Attunement or opening AQ gates qust (of course it's dimensions harder).
---
Alliance feral is better because of paladins. Shamans dont do much for us
---
You pretty much summed up the state of the game entirely.  Blizzard always has such a hard-on to funneling you into the newest content, giving little credence to your knowledge of the game.  It does little to introduce players to this obnoxious amalgamation of systems, and expects you to do 20 hours of research on YouTube just to feel like you're playing the game properly.  It's no longer an MMORPG.  It's a open-world, third-person looter shooter with a $15 sub fee.  It's had every RPG element slowly stripped away over the years, replaced with unintuitive and convoluted systems, designed to string out player engagement instead of create player enjoyment.  They don't care if you're having fun anymore, they only care if you're playing.  They immediately drop you onto this drip-feed, incremental-increase loot-treadmill that never stops.  Every mechanic for "progression" has been replaced by some sleazy, borderline predatory RNG casino-royale system, designed to keep you logging in, much the same way it causes a compulsive gambler to impulsively by scratch tickets.  It doesn't even feel like the game is made by humans anymore.  It's as if all human influence has been removed from the game, and everything is controlled by an algorithm.  It's like some executive googled "creating addiction in humans" and fed his findings into Google Deep Dream.  The game feels like it's made by AI, who have been programmed to create content which they assume is fun to humans.  It feels lifeless, repetitive, and dull.  Mike Morhaime leaving was pretty much clear evidence that any last pool of creativity has dried up.
---
Save us, Classic.  You're our only hope.
---
My goal is to have fun with my friends, that's all. And since I might play a lot more than them I'll focus on staying around the same lvl by maxing professions, exploring, doing fun random stuff.
---
Wish they could somehow get these sets in earlier as a good alternate source of gear. It's unfortunate that some parts of these sets' implementation are too impactful for early release (summon loot tables)... would be a nice timesink for some people before all the more time consuming stuff hits. I always want to get them, but I never bothered because my gear was way better when they released.
---
Not even battlechest. Nowadays you get all expansions except the latest (BFA right now) with only the subcsription. You'll only need a wow-subscription to play Classic WoW.
---
"Or did Activision completely obsorb Blizzard studios?" lol, why would you even add that when you don't even know what happened?
---
Yes that’s a dick move unless you’ve made them aware you’ll be rolling need for 2 specs off the bat
---
Not a RPer here. It's funny I loved RP in tabletop games but I'm a min maxer in MMO.
---
Would you rather have an almost empty server with 200 hardcore RPers in each faction or a server full of life even if it implies being interrupted by 'Loltauren' and 'Palaweak' sometimes ?
---
Let's be frank, hardcore RPers are a rarity.
---
Having played on a (non RP) low pop server back in Vanilla I know what I would do.
---
The reality is setting in that retail players and their toxic behavior will corrupt classic. 
---
I can see it now. Trade chat filled with trolls talking shit about how boring the game is and how we should feel bad for liking it. 
---
Also people will deliberately camp quest NPCs like Gerrick Paddfoot in the start zones just to ruin players experience. 
---
Retail players should not be given free access to classic IMO. It really is 2 separate games. 
---
Dude this is sick! Thank you so much! Big thumbs up!!!
---
The ratio will be naturally balanced after the tourists are gone.
---
On PvP servers (over 70% of the Classic player base) the ratio will be fairly balanced, almost 50/50.
---
Faction balance won't be an issue.
---
T2 Mage - Netherwind look amazing
---
Thought he was joking at first, kinda surprised to see someone like boogie, who was a massive Everquest and Vanilla wow nerd back in the day say Classic's going to fail.
---
Wow I just read your entire google docs write up and your comments here and I'm amazed. I think I overall agree with your outlook and sentiments. Your idea for parallel progression paths where no gear exceeds naxx gear really blew my mind. However I must admit I disagree with you on some points. 
---
First of all, how would you implement the raids from later expansions? I mean how do you integrate them in the world? Are Outland and Northrend available as well? Can you get gear and rep and other content from these places? Also I would personally increase raid sizes for these raids to 40 as well (but maybe this goes against your idea of rewarding 40 player raids with better gear).  
---
I really like your idea for glyphs as customizable spells where you tailor your spells and abilities to your play style and the requirements of the encounter. I also like increasing the immersiveness of attaining certain recipes. I'm not a huge fan of splitting up the end-game crafting into subsections by expansion though. Wouldn't it make more sense to just get different recipe drops in the other expansion raids or attain the recipes through NPC's in the respective continents?
---
I also like adding parallel progression paths for PvP. In my opinion this is one of the biggest flaws of vanilla. A few notes here as well though. I follow your line of reasoning in removing dishonorable kills and instead incentivizing the killing of griefing players. However, I'm not sure if this should apply to lower level players. Oftentimes when you're max level you just kill them when they compete with you for certain resources. You shouldn't be punished for that in my opinion. I'm also not a fan of adding drops to World PvP. Especially the idea of receiving grays or crafting materials from players. This seems to turn them into some sort of NPC. Maybe a separate honor token or something similar could be generated. Or maybe when killing players in World PvP it would increase your rep towards a faction that would reward World PvP specific items. The amount of rep gained would depend on the different factors you describe.  
---
I also love the idea of perks for exalted characters. Ever since I started playing WoW, I thought it was pretty weird that a faction would essentially treat you exactly the same from neutral through exalted.  
---
The dude is seriously irritating.  
---
I went out of my way to let Youtube know I don't want to see him (right click, this channel doesn't interest me etc) but they sneakily suggest some videos about "XXX reacts to Asmongold reaction of ..." ... please kill me :D  
---
Brack-lite lmao
---
Insane guide buddy! Thanks a lot.
---
Sounds reasonable. Good job collecting the guides this far, was not my intention to spam you.
---
“Thicc” yea it fit
---
We’re already getting static 1.12 AV, just make it BoE
---
This just sounds like a casual guild, they already exist, you're essentially handicapping yourself if you refuse to use *ANY* consumes but...that's your prerogative.
---
Smacking those lazy peons is one of the most satisfying thing in game !
---
I even had a low lvl char that never completed the quest so I could blow some steam when I felt the need to :D
---
Totally true, though most start changing over to fire soon after and you end up looking like a frog-man with jade in-laid vestements or other non-set gear :\\
---
Balance is a tricky thing at the best of times. I always think of Starcraft: Brood War when I consider balance. 
---
SC:BW is widely considered one of the most balanced competitive games of all time. But it was never intended to be, and it shows. There's tons of units in the game that are, on the face of it, straight up broken. Defilers, Lurkers, Siege Tanks, Science Vessels, High Templar, Arbiters just to name a few. Their ability to change the course of a battle in a split second is testimony to their power. Good players have to be able to utilise counters to such units with split second reactions, or risk losing whole armies. That's one of the reasons SC:BW is still watched even today; it makes for an exciting game to watch and to play. 
---
WoW at release was absolutely not balanced. PvP was a secondary concern, and the developers only really started considering PvP balance late in development. Gear balancing was hilariously haphazard. Talent trees were all over the place, with vital skills like Innervate and Blessing of Kings stuck as 31 point talents. 
---
Yet despite all this, or perhaps because of it, the game was fantastically successful. Players it turns out thrive quite well in an atmosphere of imbalance. They try and overcome inherent weaknesses or the dominant meta, which is why players like [Zalgradis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOXrGmulbMk) and [Swifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPexEfCG7g) are still fondly remembered today. They try and find ways to make things work even when they weren't intended, like Feral Druids now using Manual Crowd Pummellers as BiS weapons, or cloth wearing Shamans zapping people down in Warsong Gultch. 
---
Games that don't set out with a goal of total balance can sometimes be beautiful things. Heroes of Might and Magic III, an ancient game by anyone's standards, is still immensely popular today despite being completely and hilariously unbalanced. Age of Empires 2 attracts a big fan-base even now despite its internal balance being a joke. 
---
In striving for balance, it's all too easy to miss out on fun. And if there's one thing Classic WoW was, and will be, it's fun. And I'll take that over perfect balance any day of the week. 
---
Wait until closer to release. They there aren't any RP PVP, just roll on a PVP server and start an RP guild. You could even find like-minded humans though Reddit and assign a defacto RP PVP server.
---
In 2004 before Oceanic servers were out Australians generally agreed that Blackrock would be our defacto server. Worked pretty well.
---
Troll is one of those races that get way more hype then they really deserve. A full HP Beaserking isnt even one extra cast as a mage.
---
Bear tank is viable ln either side. They are a little better on ally to be honest because of blessings they can also be used to dps. The thing about being a bear tank is you really need to be willing to min/max so if you're not willing to rank to r13 then don't roll druid you wont be able to optimize the gear pre aq40 unless you rank.
---
I came to say this same thing...
---
Lets go home!
---
It's a dick move if you dont tell them before hand. Before the run starts tell em you want to roll on healing gear
---
I see where you're coming from, but I was more think along the lines of a reasonable hc and dedicated raid guild of at least mythic level skill and willing to no-life prebis farming and raid 4+ days a week during progression. But yes, it is a deliberate handicap, I think that's obvious, but my God C'thun is childs-play with modern meta... it's quite the let down if I'm honest.
---
I'm in it for the adventure too. Can't wait. 
---
If you have so many people, I would consider you happy.   
---
Over my lifetime i played wow with about 25 IRL friends/classmates, we started in TBC though. Not a single one of them except for me is excited for classic. Most of them think it takes to long and is too much of an investment. 
---
Thats why I am personally very afraid of classic, because it will be the first time I play wow "alone" without IRL friends.
---
So consider yourself happy.
---
This is only a mathematical projection, based on 3 massively popular games...2 of them not being MMO's.
---
There is a MASSIVE population of players that will play Classic that are NOT on Reddit. We have 60k subs on r/classicwow...and we don't even KNOW the launch date.
---
r/classicwow also have a much higher ratio of online/offline (1.82%) than r/wow (0.56%) and r/overwatch (0.19%).
---
Only r/apexlegends, which is BRAND NEW and EXTREMELY POPULAR Battle Royale is above r/classicwow (2.15%)
---
The comparison should be made only against r/wow , to be honest. We have THREE TIMES more active users than r/wow...and Classic is not even live.
---
The number of subscribers vs the number of accounts created is a good comparison. There have been over 130 million WoW accounts created since 2004. (Last official figure was 100 million in January 2014). There is no way that between January 2014 and January 2019, even with WoW in decline, that there weren't tens of millions of accounts created.
---
I would say that the r/wow number of subscribers accounts for 0.8 to 1% of the Classic WoW potential players. Closer to 1%, I would say, because the game is not even live yet, and there is a huge number of players that are not on Reddit.
---
This will put the number of Classic players at launch, at least, between 6 and 8 million players. With a retention rate of around 40% in 6 months. In 6 months, there will be between 2.4 and 3.2 million Classic WoW players
---
You can easily do MC, BWL and Ony with 20g worth of consumables, thats 20minutes of farming for a raidnight.
---
ZG and AQ20 nobody requires to get any consumes at all, not even in pugs. You may chug a FAP for spider boss in ZG if you fancy, but not even that is required.
---
Only in AQ40 and Naxxramas good guilds really start to require to stack consumables to mitigate the chance of people fucking up. Halfing C'thun fight makes it a lot easier, Naxxramas indeed has quite huge consume requirements, but that was the case in vanilla WoW too.
---
Seeing as world buffs should be back on their 6-8 hour timers it's going to be a lot of raiding without them unless blizzard makes a change.
---
There has not
---
Out of interest, why is it important?
---
Karazan. Ulduar. ICC
---
Hunters have one of the most competitive pre raid BIS gear. Every melee wants those Rend swords and Truestrike shoulders. Let alone HoJ which is technically BIS for Hunter in stage 1 since there are no Dire Maul Books.
---
Proudmoore US, some names I vaguely remember;
---
Parn (only person I saw with the unarmored black nightsaber mount), Hammerfell, Danny, Yuuna (Luuna? Rogue with both warglaives), Eldarian (Eldarion? Ashes of Al'ar)
---
Big 3 guilds I remember were Risen, Ruined, Renaissance and Lunacy (these guys were big in BC)
---
And of course, when 3.0.2 came out, a Retribution Paladin in a guild called Naenae(?) had a new title to go with his name; Salty Jesus
---
Idk about you but personally I'd rather farm the consumes and crush the raid in as few raid nights as possible and I think that's the general feeling from many players. 
---
Path of least resistance and what not.
---
Here’s a pretty comprehensive BiS list for Druid - all specs that I think could fit nicely here. 
---
Kind of insane that someone did this. Credit does not go to me! 
---
Guilds will just communicate. Guilds already share world buff pops on pservers so won't be hard. Discord is a thing etc.
---
Well said
---
I don't you're getting the point, "makes it a lot easier" is what I consider a con, not a pro. But as I said, I'm expecting to be in the minority with this mentality.
---
If you want REAL ugly roll a male troll. Goodbye helmets. Goodbye backs. Goodbye chests. Goodbye legs that aren't kilts.
---
Still love them. 
---
If you like the playstyle, play mage. If it bothers you that much carry around some 'casual' attire that you can switch into while your in cities etc.
---
How much do you need to farm to pay for all the repairs ;)
---
When these so called hardcore, one of the best players in the world (that has played nothing but only private servers) comes and starts talking about "vanilla" stats and rng, well, you will have to excuse me but thats just not on point.
---
I have nothing against these players, it's just the missleading information they provide that bothers me.
---
#Avoid Kargoz guides for Rogues, Paladins, and Warriors!
---
Just a heads up ya'll, Kargoz's guides are based on p-servers and have major p-server bugs as **primary class mechanics**, such as front-stabbing and /sit macros to trigger crits &amp; rage for warriors and paladins.
---
His builds for those classes are flawed and aren't going to work as intended in Classic.
---
I assumed that the case for the majority. But there is a iron man mode or no dmg/no gear run for most games, because although the minority, some people don't like easy mode gaming.
---
This is cool and funny.  Can I ask why you did it? Not being facetious, just wondering if it was a particular in game moment, or just a cool screenshot. 
---
I get that, some values may be off. Still, these players are probably MUCH better than those who played actual vanilla. Not to mention that most of these hardcore players also played during 2004-2006.
---
Yeah warrior's weren't even a great dps class for most of vanilla.
---
Prot warriors had more aggro issues before all the shield slam changes.
---
But on the other hand, Druids are already way better tanks in 1.12 than they were in prior patches.
---
I think nerfing warriors to resemble previous vanilla patches would already push druids into a great niche high-TPS spot. They're already used in pservers quite often. Just not as a full time MT, but the main reason for that is just a lack of tools, like defensive cooldowns and a second taunt.
---
I'd also like to see pre-update tankadin. They apparently had great single target aggro with less mana usage due to judgement of fury creating flat ~300 threat out of any holy damage proc (r1 consecrate), and better hybrid possible specs for healing. I never saw that and I'm very interested.
---
I don't mind warriors being the most reliable single target tank. Being the best at everything is the problem.
---
He also later confirmed that he never actually started there.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6nutym/first_image_from_the_black_temple_trailer/
---
*applauds*
---
No word on it, but pretty sure there will be Oceanic servers. There is Oceanic on retail. So no reason not to have it on Classic.
---
We need more notice than that.  We need to know when to request that sweet sweet PTO.
---
I would like to see [this guide on weapon swapping for druids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNnlduOumH0) included. I just learned about this yesterday and it's super well explained.
---
This is just wholly incorrect. The decelopers like to keep parity between versions. 
---
Same reason why skeleton King was changed to wraith king in the US version of dota 2 even though it was explicitly done for Chinese localization
---
This is some serious none-issue being taken to seriously.
---
Classic will separate us in two crowds: Those who enjoy an open-to-interpretation, immersive world and those who don't care.
---
I can't help but sometimes sense a hint of bitterness or resentment from the retail crowd that maybe we have some values they never understood or left behind. 
---
Same reason why skeleton King was changed to wraith king in the US version of dota 2 even though it was explicitly done for Chinese localization.
---
Continue to feel free talking completely pit of your ass though I guess 
---
Everyone wants to be a warrior but ain’t nobody wanna level a warrior. 
---
Why don't you just run regular guild where people can put in the time they can afford and raid with whatever consumables that allows them? That way you're not limiting anyone but not demanding anything either.
---
Because devs keep parity across versions instead of having a unique version of the software for all 50 localizations that they have 
---
TIL describing the exact reason a thing happened is shilling. Thanks. 
---
I'm planning to resub about a day before the planned release, and say one last farewell to retail.
---
Unless there is some pre-Classiic event on retail, then I'll resub earlier.
---
Blizzard did say no RP PvP and they existed in retail vanilla. So that logic is flawed in Blizzards perspective :(
---
&gt; who just want to check it out and will quit before lvl 20.
---
Leveling to level 20 is still more content then BfA.
---
Havnt heard much either way 
---
This dude cant imagine anyone being able to enjoy something without becoming so overly engrossed in it they throw everything else in their life out the window.
---
Right but finding 40+ of those people all on the same server who can all make the raid schedule and have the time to commit...unlikely at best.
---
Iron Man challenges are solo, as are the no damage/no gear runs for games like dark souls.
---
Raiding is a team effort and to have everyone have the same opinions about consumes while also being dedicated enough to spend at least 12+ hours a week raiding and hardcore farming prebis is just not going to happen, most players who are hardcore are also not interested in wasting time and seek to be as efficient as possible.
---
More of self-made badge of honor kinda deal. Normal guilds by inherently allowing people to slack will probably fail to clear naxx in general. Slacking would not be an option and I'd fully expect such a guild capable of clearing it in a reasonable time-frame due to dedication and skill.
---
Same here! The feels are so good!

Well there was no RP-PVP at launch in vanilla. But regardless of that. That is a completely separate issue. Not offering a game in a certain time zone is very stupid.

What can I tell you. I dont enjoy wiping 15 minutes into a bosskill (C'thun) when you could've secured the kill in 11minutes while you already threw out 40gold that attempt in mandatory protection potions that even people back in the day had to use to not die to heavy nature and shadow damage in the C'thun fight.
---
Yes, using Flask of Supreme Power to nuke Shazzrah not in 25seconds but in 15 is kinda dumb, but that's on you joining such a shitshow of a guild that wastes everybody's time by making them farm flasks for MC, ZG or AQ20. 
---
Horde fury tanks are higher threat than feral tanks. Feral tanks on horde side are not good.
---
What’s a battle chest 
---
Circle jerking furiously
---
I haven’t heard anything as of yet about plans for a physical release of classic as of yet from a blue post. They said that classic was going to run alongside of retail, so I think the idea until further notice is it will be digital only, like the warcraft 3 remaster sitting in your launcher right now
---
I'm not really in favour of added content but as long as we're speculating:
---
All the the things slated in wows early drafts, such as Hyjal, Kara, HFP, Northernd, level cap to 70, Uldum, Dragon Isles, Azshara, Caverns of Time, etc
---
Having another account seems like a waste. Unless you plan on powerleveling your mage you might as well do it on the same account. Finding mage portals and conjured food is pretty easy. 
---
Even with the "good" version of Stormstrike, the best way to use it is just after an AA, because if it procs WF, WF will reset your swing timer anyway.
---
Rogues do that with ss aswell. In a min-max situation, old stormstrike is not "unuseable" at all, it's pretty much the same.
---
This is true. You gotta pvp rank hard and won't get any gear and you still won't excel on horde side. It requires a very special kind of person to be fine with that.
---
I hate to sound cliche, but pick what you enjoy. People say it’s hard to get a raid spot yadda yadda. For me, as long as I’m a viable class/spec.. such as fury warrior, I would be okay picking that because I know I’ll put in the time/research to be the best that I can be, and I have confidence I’d be good at it/get a raid spot/wreck noobs.
---
Follow your dreams! 
---
My point is, I bet you C'thun can be killed without protection pots. With proper distancing and quick interrupts there is nothing that is one shot and, in fact, on many attempts I have forgotten to "re-pop" mid fight to absolutely no discernible difference in my hp due to op healing
---
If you want a guild to nolife it up while increasing difficulty then at least offer some benefit to it. Overrecruit or help level alts and see how few people you can use to finish a raid. That way you still get to do things the ‘harder’ way but you also get benefit out of it by running more raids and gearing faster.
---
I wonder if Blizz will do anything about that solo DM N thing, it really is broken. Otherwise we might see a crazy amount of hunter alts, it is just 2x more profitable compared to anything else (depended on server economy but should be around so). 
---
Favourite screenshot. Had a lot of fun with blackmercy and we often reflect on those days. I dropped him his own framed photo next to his pc while he was at work, he said it was his favourite photo when he found it. It was a really good time.
---
I fucking hope not. It was beyond sick... meaning the number of hours i for one played in top raiding guild.
---
Please direct private server discussion to r/wowservers (Rule #1/#4). Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
p.s. delete your WDB folder and if that fails delete your WTF folder.
---
Rush level and start AE farming. Buy all the materials you need, the market will be flooded for 2-3 months with herbs and ore. 
---
I meant to add, is it more XP to multi box and try killing mobs 1 to 2 levels higher with the duo or is it faster to grind separately?  Thinking about all the damage and speed per kill w/ 2 instead of 1 toon.
---
It's almost insane to think about how much more excitement and crowd hype a video of a ~15 year old game being brought up again brings... I don't think I've seen the Blizzcon crowd hyped more about any other announcement related to WoW.
---
Just goes to show that a great game is a great game. Sometimes change is good and inevitable, but sometimes it simply should not be touched. Much like a classic car should be enjoyed the way it is and was, with all its old, inferior tech etc.
---
No matter how many times I watch this video or even Vanilla intro trailer, I get so excited that I shed a few tears.
---
I hope to God they sell a physical box for 60$ and it just has a piece of paper saying "just buy a sub lul"
---
Better alliance because off +10% stat buff from paladins.  
---
You kill faster but get 50% xp 
---
As brought up in another thread - the sets may look nice, but hardly anyone actually uses them. You'll be swapping into tier gear to stand around in cities and raiding in other mixed loot. 
---
Except Priest. Priests use almost their full tier sets and have a great staff to boot.

In the guild I was in during vanilla with we usually only used pots/flasks during new bosses or bosses we didn't have on farm status and we cleared up to the 4 horsemen and we never used the amount pots/buffs I have seen on video's from pserver. I dont even think half of our dps even know what a rotation was and we still got that far.
---
I think the only guilds that will go that crazy for buffs will be people pushing for server first/speed run
---
You're right. Now I wonder if it would be worth to start playing a month after Classic releases to wait for the playerbase to filter out.
---
That’s the kind of advice I came here for!  Besides, it would seriously slow me down if I tried picking every herb, mining every node, skinning every beast as I level
---
Why do you need r13 as bear? Based on Taladrils [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#), everywhere where I can see rank 13 I see a better or a slightly worse item for somewhere else that is not Naxx or AQ. For example Bone Ring Helmet offers better defensive stats but worse offensive ones than Rank13, a slight downgrade but does not validate ranking up. Chest slot comes from BWL, pants are from WSG, etc.
---
I really do believe that is a brilliant idea, online gaming has grown so much and everything everywhere are all now related to businesses and money. The glory days of a true gaming community is fading too fast new player dont ever get to experience it
---
Leveling a warrior is easy. Farming the 3k+ needed for the stupid amount of BoE items warriors use is the hard part.
---
Gotcha, so multiboxing heavily relies on questing for leveling it seems
---
Gimping progression and making time spent outside of raids all but meaningless unless going for pvp ranks.
---
Yeah it's a bad idea.
---
This is cool, but we can't forget that Squidward dressed up as Santa for a day just to make SpongeBob happy.
---
I see in the priest guide it says to get a quiver ASAP for the ranged attack speed bonus (wands) but did this actually work in classic? I thought it was a pserver bug 
---
Passed this along to the other mods to confer. Might side-bar it, but no promises just yet.
---
I think they will do it in their stream Q&amp;A's. The last one was about BFA, i think they mentioned next one in like few weeks. That could be it.
---
Thanks a lot for the tips, I'll try :)
---
I would prefer a guild named &lt;Whathever you want&gt; with everyone using pots or not as they want.  
---
And just MT are overbuffed (helped by the guild).  
---
Just like most guild back then. So many casual/semi-casual guilds cannot farm to ensure being over buffed every raids.  
---
Druid stealths up to target, hunter fucks them up at range. The synergy isn't crazy good but you can definitely make it work AND you can go through mara as a duo if either of you need items drom there which is cool. Maybe Trib too if it works but that's a tough one for druids to stealth through.
---
SSD will be enough, as a quick rule of thumb.
---
I have no experience multi boxing but I can only assume it has advantages and disadvantages. Like you won’t die as much and world pvp would be more fun. But leveling slower overall seems to be a disadvantage 
---
WoW has never been balanced.
---
Playing retail you have no idea who will be top DPS in a month from now. No idea what the PvP meta is next patch.
---
Every class in vanilla is desirable for raiding. Every class in vanilla shines in some aspect of PvP.
---
If you're talking about the armory, you can't see characters that haven't been active for a certain amount of time. You need to log in to the actual game and view them from the character select screen.
---
I can't wait to troll people in general chat and tell them how terrible they are for playing this old ass old game. If course ill be doing it whilst enjoying the game myself. Why are people so affected by trolls? You know they just doin it to get a rise out of you, right? I can't wait to bait your thin skinned asses.
---
I’m very upset the infinite jump glitch won’t be a thing, I’ve waited 14 years to spam that glitch!
---
I wish that was the case, unfortunately, meta is totally a thing and people eventually fall in-line. I noticed myself doing it without even noticing, simple example, "Juju's are a thing" "oh, really?" ...proceeds to have juju power, might and ember for every raid thereafter. Multiply that by 10x and you get the idea

&gt; If Blizz makes realms have a cap of 2500 as was rumored to be in Vanilla, that means for 60k people, we'd need a minimum of 24 realms, all full to the brim. 
---
Wrong. The Vanilla realm median population was around 10,000 players. There were around 700 realms (I think 243 US realms, 247 EU realms, 160 Chinese realms and 43-44 realms for Aus/NZ/SK/Japan/Indonesia/Malaysia etc. and 7.4 million players 3 months before TBC.
---
2,500 was the CONCURRENT PLAYER CAP.
---
Exhibit A. 
---
NE looks better.
---
private salt
---
I'd honestly prefer to raidlog and enjoy my time instead of yawning through my 1 millionth Frostmaul Giant just to yawn through C'thun. At least pvp is a challenge!
---
I think you should make a 10:01 minute video about it. And remember to complain about every possible scenario, to cover your bases. 
---
You're probably right, and undoubtedly, I'll "fall in line" with the rest of the plebs, but I just wanted to see if there are any out there who feel the same.
---
I beg to differ my dude. Try leveling a hunter and then a warrior. You’re gonna be like wtfbro warrior sucks type “DELETE” in the field below
---
thats super interesting, i think all classes may have their potential moments, but hunters, druids n locks would lead the pack imo
---
Any reason in particular on why he left?
---
Druid open world PvP is busted, so is Hunter.
---
Druid let's you tank or heal. Hunter let's you farm gold really easily.
---
But you could not main tank being a prot pally or bear druid, per exemple. Could you? That's what I mean, you were somehow stuck on a build if you wanted to shine. (Especially in pve)
---
World buffs are overpowered as hell, tbh. Having 18% more spell crit, flat 15 all stats, 15% stamina, 15% to ALL stats and 10% damage as a caster is just ridiculous.
---
No word but there are certainly enough players to warrant, at least one.
---
I’m pretty sure that there won’t be regional servers, there might but the internet doesn’t have the same problems it once had and people can play fine with a high ping now. 
---
I have no qualms against RP PvP servers except what to do when them RP PvP servers die. 
---
I will probably resub the day before launch.
---
Not sooner. BfA doesn't deserve even 1 day worth of sub.
---
I like that mentality!
---
No argument there.
---
But those pieces require exaulted so if you're going to use them you will want to be ranking because thats the only way you'll get exaulted.
---
You don't need a battlechest anymore even for retail, only a sub, it wouldn't make sense to have one for Classic, especially since the sub is shared.
---
Another matter is a Collectors, I'd love one, but Blizz didn't say anything about it yet.
---
&gt; Allowing a hunter to go from full tier 1 to full tier 2 is a waste of gear.
---
So it's better to disenchant the hunter gear?
---
It's the dwarf at the end. I know he's coming every time I watch the announcement (yes, I watch it regularly.....), but yet every time he shows up I get tingles and feelings. 
---
Says the guy named kanye_westfall roflmak
---
I watched the rogue guide for nostalgia, but don´t plan to play one again. He says some questionable stuff like skill imp gouge. No one does this while leveling, it is a high end pvp skill. 3% dodge does a lot more for the thousands of hits that you are going to take. Why would you need a guide that tells you the wrong things? I had to look up what facestabbing was. Private servers are ridicolous. 
---
I’d hate that meta for sure, would not put up with it. Maybe join your guild if I had the time:-D
---
From my experience on the pserver I am on now the NA guilds who raid at my time we all don't coordinate and we tend to Fuck each other over for some reason when it comes to song flower.
---
Desperate private player spotted.
---
Do they know that? Ion said it was niche. 
---
&gt; With all the fire resistance mobs in MC/BWL you can do very well as an affliction Warlock in early classic
---
Debuff limit bro
---
I played a rogue in all of vanilla and would partially agree. His rogue guide is not the very best. 
---
It was a "box" containing the game plus all expacs except the last one plus 30 days of gametime.
---
It was required until some time ago if you never ever bought the game before, now it's not anymore, you need just a sub to play all the game except last expac (that you buy separately).
---
All tipsout does is complain complain complain
---
Blizzard didn't say no RP PvP. They said no RP PvP servers planned at this stage because they didn't think the demand was there - which has been proved wrong; I guarantee there will be RP PvP servers. 
---
Smart move.
---
I did it in January 2018. Instead of buying BfA, I bought 4 tokens.
---
Why do you want to look all pretty looking? Standing there in full epics that you cant hide behind transmogs is COOL.  Standing there in all greens you cant hide behind transmogs is MOTIVATING.

bubba was his name in my guild, i think he used bubbadub in DnT.  he went to play LoL as bubbadub for complexity, and then managed C9 or something.  known for wearing a sick mustache and lulu hat on stream
---
Hey, teebling here - I compiled the original list which you have kindly referenced at the top of the post.
---
Could you please inform me which links were broken so that I can fix them/relink them to archived versions?
---
Yeh I wish that blizzard realised that this sort of chain would be great for casuals to get good gear, it’s not trivialised and it can be done in bite size pieces (no commitments or raiding schedule needed). I think a chain like this should have been in the game at release. 
---
Depending on what that window is im not sure.  They didn't give up unused names for a LONG time.   I also made a level 1 to reserve my names for allied races on live that didn't release for months at a time.  
---
In theory I could just login to them once every other week to use up some of the rested XP and then logout again.
---
Make this same post on the classic forum if you haven’t.

Shaman content is a bit thin. Melderon has some great guides.

If one person was dedicated enough to get every profession maxed, with the sub-profs like tribal lw, on a single account, which classes would be best for gathering to supply the primary profs of others?
---
Example
---
* Tauren Druid - Skinning / herb
---
* Mage - Enchanting / Tailoring
---
* Hunter - Engineering / Leatherwork(Dragonscale)
---
* Rogue - Skin / Leatherworking(Tribal)
---
* Warlock - Alchemy / Tailoring
---
Well I was pretty much decided on Tauren druid with occasional OTing in raids and this thread pretty much nuked my motivation on that one.  Back to the drawing board I go.
---
It will literally not help enough to warrant. Rogue main would be if it more from a pocket Pally, but still, you don’t kill twice as fast sooooo...
---
I´m not touching retail

http://east.paxsite.com/schedule/panel/battle-for-azeroth-the-competitors-history-of-wow?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Friday @ 2:00 BFA panel, not saying anything will come of it but it’s on the schedule. 
---
He's saying it's better to give prio of t1 to hunterA, meaning they get all the new t1 first, and then give t2 prio to hunterB, so that way gear isn't wasted via sharing loot so that it takes forever for sets to get completes . It doesn't mean disenchant gear.
---
I agree with the above assessment. Horde beartanks do not benefit from Shamans the same was as Alliance bear tanks benefit from Paladins.
---
remove any and all Kargoz guides, they incorporate bugs, exploits and reverse-engineer bandaid fixes that did literally NOT exist in classic. 
---
I dont agree that all specs should be balanced for pve and pvp, I value class and spec uniqueness over that.
---
Having all balanced tends to push them towards equalness. I don’t like that - rogues should be the masters of stealth, hunters of pets, and so on. You can’t give blink and a self heal to every class, it kills the uniqueness and diversity that is the vanilla fun. 
---
Rp-pve is just RP. Don’t know why everyone suddenly started saying rp-pve again. As far as I can tell blizzard doesn’t use rp-pve as a designation.
---
You don´t need consumables besides titans for tanks until AQ. 
---
Yeah but what if I wanna be the only female dwarf Fury warrior in classic? /thinking
---
Why fo you think only specific servers will be allowed to transfer?
---
ZG Enchants are not usable for twinking, at least not in the 19 bracket where I played. I think they soulbind items they are used on - they were only useful in WotLK where you could use them on BoA shoulders to great effect. The only shoulder enchants you can get in vanilla are the ones that drop from Sapphiron - and that will be very difficult to do (at least for the foreseeable future).
---
It’s a good idea in theory. But in reality it’s going to take twice as long until you get to play the character you want to play. And if you’re a casual and playtime is limited then that’s probably a bad idea. 
---
I dont know you might have to ask him
---
That they did a U-Turn on not putting in RP-PvP servers and that they will be implementing them on day 1.
---
It doesn't say on or before, it simply says  is expected to come out 12/31/2019.
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted when it literally says in the battle.net launcher exactly what I wrote...
---
Is that March increase from blue post hype?
---
Whoever wants perfect balance has never played any tabletop pen&amp;paper game. When you started with this grassroots fantasy genre you know what is important and what not. 
---
You said no other support can bring 3 buffs and still heal well. You're wrong. 
---
Hm, I see what you're getting at. Then proclaiming this here and elsewhere makes sense as you will be hardpressed to find progression raiders who on the other hand abstain from consumables. 
---
It's an interesting idea but from 100 players, possibly one may try this out, but after couple wipes on Loatheb due to just brutal shadow damage will throw in the towel. 
---
I honestly think, such a guild project would fail, because when people who joined with the idea in mind quit, you will be seriously hardpressed to find new people who aren't just slackers who cant be arsed to not farm consumes.
---
In a way being hardcore and not using consumables is mutually exclusive for the vast, vast majority of WoW vanilla players.
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion, but having raided back in vanilla from MC up to 4 horsemen in nax...I'm going to say Blackrock Spire
---
It gave you freedom with the route, had content for every one (both 5 mans and 15man raids in just 1 instance), had tons of bosses, was relevant all game long (tanking flask, quests, attunements, 0,5 set), and, in general, its vertical design, with witch slow fall allowed you to travel jumping down from bridges to reach other zones of the dungeon, wich gave up a sort of upwards/downwards Blackrock deeps (my favorite 5 man) feel that no other raid had.  
---
No because to effectively farm you will need to invest money into your famrer character so they can farm effectively / efficiently. I dont really think its a good idea for a casual, the 1-60 grind in vanilla WoW took ages, and if you do it once you'll probably be quite unlikely to do it again as a casual.
---
Dual boxing a mage/rogue isn't super optimal. First, the mage will be able to teleport at 20 and the rogue won't, which will slow down the mage's leveling by a fair amount. Second, the rogue runs out of health while leveling and the mage runs out of mana. The rogue does nothing to help the mage's mana and the mage doesn't help the rogue's combat health (although you can duel polymorph for a quick out of combat heal). They don't synergize very well at all, and I would guess you would be faster just leveling them one at a time (taking advantage of rested xp).
---
However, if you want to max them as quickly as possible as far as real life time goes (not /played), then I understand the dual boxing.
---
Realm pop
---
Still 111 days? fml
---
&gt;
---
You can't get too far in the end game playing solo
---
&gt;You will never be as powerful as the hardcore players
---
I wouldn't say these are cons, they even lean towards pros
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted like my comment was. Blizz never said reforged was releasing early in 2019.
---
I preordered it, and in the battle.net launcher it says "Warcraft III: Reforged is expected to come out 12/31/2019."
---
Not on, or before, just simply 12/31/2019. It will likely come out before this date, but to expect reforged before classic is probably getting your hopes up.
---
Release wise, it would make complete sense. Get people hyped up to play classic by reliving the game that got a lot of people into WoW in the first place. But based on the one mission we got a blizzcon, I really wouldn't expect reforged to be released before classic at all.
---
That's the point. But people do, on a mega scale. I would go even further to say you don't need consumables for all of AQ and even Naxx if you're game for mythic+ level 40-man raiding.
---
I'm currently developing a website [https://classicguides.ca](https://classicguides.ca/) that has basic guides for all classes such as level 60 talents, pre-raid BIS lists, enchants, leveling builds + tips, profession guides as well as some addons. My goal with the site is to have one spot with quick basic guides for everything in classic.
---
As mentioned earlier it's still in development but I would love some feedback :)
---
&gt; Every melee wants those Rend swords 
---
or use the 2h from the quest
---
You could use this item on other players right? 
---
Time committed will be faster leveling 2 characters at once versus 2 characters to 60 individually.  XP for killing mobs will be halved, but “kill x mobs” and “go get so-and-so’s head” you’ll only have to do once.  If you want to purely grind it out, you’re not saving much time since XP is halved.  
---
This cannot be achieved via addons, it's hard coded in WoW.
---
It was even in WoD till some late patch, you had an option somewhere to enable classic damage numbers. 
---
I really hope they bring it back. 
---
Well there was no 1.12 at launch in vanilla either :D But yes, I'm quite certain both Oceanic servers and RP-PvP servers will be avalible at release.
---
It removes a few things. 1 the cost of a dispel magic. 2. Reaction time to dispel. And 3 I'm 90%sure if your tank gets feared they cant block with backturned if warrior. Also would cause placement if bosses/certain mobs to be moved and potentially wipe the raid. Fear ward is GOAT for priests. Go dwarf.
---
I can't remember why anymore, but I used to really dislike lbrs.  There was so much good loot there for rogues anyway.  I do remember stealthing in with other rogues/druids and ganking a boss or two.
---
Lots of shortcuts...  that part was cool.  I loved the shortcut where in brd you swim in lava/hop island to island to bypass nearly everything and get to the MC Raid entrance.  I ran that route many times to help people.
---
If you aren't playing on an RP server, literally no one will ever stop in Stormwind and comment "nice gear bro" on you, so this is literally a non issue. 
---
It's like when you're at the gym and you're worried people are looking / laughing at you or whatever. No. People only care about their own character, not yours.
---
Release date for reforged to occupy time till classic. Also realm lists. 
---
Imagine beeing a melee class and geting aggro when the tank is runing around in fear. One hit and you are dead. Second hit and another melee is dead. And thats only for bosses who dont cleave. Nefarian (if I remember right) can kill a group of melees during one fear with his cleaves. Battle Rezz was a rare resource and most bosses didn't just fear one or twice during a fight. You had to tankswitch as horde. As alliance you could kill Nef or Ony with only one tank and some dwarf priests and didn't need an offtank who also needs to be equiped first.  
---
Fear ward = faster progress
---
The warlock j norton guide links to a wrong youtube video. Should link here https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1087
---
Fair enough, didn't catch that. Still won't get a date from that sadly. 
---
Classic all the way.
---
Release date and then servers
---
no, remeber its a progressive vanilla, there gonna be monthes of time before tiers, and first tier is easy and arent demanding at all, and the earlier you start gearing up your main the further it'll be and get.  if you level farm char first you gonna be behind in everything, for quite some time, and its not fun.
---
you don't really need much gold as a shaman. also you aren't that mount dependent since you get your wolf (40% speed). 
---
and first tier doesnt require much consumables at all. few fire prot potions, few mana pots and runes that you can farm yourself and you are good to go. its like 20-30g max. you don't need to level a farming mage for that.
---
level a farm character as a second char, between raids cd and when you are finished with intial gearing for your first char. farm char will help you later, and support whatever you'd like to do in the game. other chars, twinks, expensive shit and so on.
---
Also there are ways to farm as a rsham aswell. gold farming is a whole world of different methods and approaches. you can 2man run dmeast with a warrior, and split money, or him running mining you enchanting. 
---
once you get gear you can solo some bosses in 5mans and de aswell, there are other sheneningans in mid level insances that you can do aswell. not to mention you can just farm some mobs that drop good shit in open world, with some builds like ele/restor or enh/restor. like satyrs in felwood, for felcloth. thats just some examples. gold farming in vanilla is a whole world or various shit ppl come up with. depending on their brain and their class arsenal of tools. you don't need to go herb/alch if you don't want to.
---
but yea later game become more and more expensive so its not a bad idea to level a mage for gold farming. but its later into the game. don't elve it as a first char.
---
WHY DUDE WHYY!!!! I CRY AT WORK DAMMIT 😭♥️♥️♥️
---
Lul
---
You have to push trough the starting areas. This game will weed out the weak soon. 
---
I've dabbled in pservers myself in the past. My theory is that it'll be a snowball effect - the majority will leave and because of that the people left behind will be disheartened by the sudden low population and also switch to official servers where all the action will be at.
---
There might be a few hundred people left on pservers who absolutely won't pay a single penny for Classic when they can get it for free, but they are the extreme fringe and will always exist.
---
use resistance pot for lord ( prolly keep it for the last phase), spam disarms.
---
maybe interrupt the life drain or mana drain him
---
mortalstrike?
---
are the ads stunable? to stop the beam
---
Why would I play a game where I'm instantly level 110, just seems pointless, blows my mind, it's why am also excited for classic (someone who's new to the series I don't get instantly "rewarded" for throwing money at blizzard) 
---
The wait is killing me man, videogames in the past year or so are failing left and right, WoW devs promise this and that on live WoW, and all I can think is...*I can't wait for vanilla to release so I can never look back to any of their crap that they are offering.*
---
But at the same time I 'm affraid they gonna fuck up something and my hopes and dreams along with it.
---
I just want to hear what happens at PAX East. Might be more revealed there than just the rumoured release date.
---
At a conservative 35G/hour, 10 days played equals 8,4k gold. At 8 days played you are looking at a 6,72k gold opportunity cost of leveling another char to 60...
---
Not worth it, right
---
I am sorry, but you are absolutely speculating on what Ion said, and you clearly can't read between the lines, focusing on what you BELIEVE to mean "NO RP PvP servers".
---
What Ion said was right and absolutely logical. 
---
Before this interview, we had the new 6 phase content release. Blizzard wants a Classic as close as possible to Vanilla, and the new 6 phase content proves it. But, there were no RP PvP servers at Vanilla launch. EVEN SO, Ion said that there WILL BE RP servers for larger regions (US, EU and probably Asia).
---
He is also right that RP PvP is a niche. But, he also ADDED that if there will be a large demand for that servers (RP PvP) after Classic unfolds, they will be open to adding them.
---
So, basically, they do not plan to have RP PvP servers at start, but if there will be enough demand for this type of servers, they are open to create them.
---
And, let's be HONEST here : if there is NO DEMAND, there won't be RP PvP servers. If THERE IS demand, they will most likely create them.
---
As it stands now, the demand for Classic RP PvP servers is a minuscule percentage. The problem is that nobody knows how many Classic players will be in total, so that minuscule percentage will be high enough in actual numbers, to justify the creation of RP PvP servers.
---
If I would be an RP PvP player...I would wait and see if there are enough players like me to start asking for an RP PvP server option.  
---
I imagine a certain demographic of Chinese and eastern europeans will remain on pservers as they can't afford paying for classic (not all of them mind you!). 
---
But the majority of EU and NA are 25-40 years old nowadays and can easily piss away 15$ a month for some quality entertainment. There really is no reason to keep playing on pservers hosted by some corrupt fucks doing their shady deals on the expense of their playerbase.
---
Because boss positioning is very important. Just 1 second of feared tank can cause the boss to do breath attack which wipes the raid or a knockback on healers, which causes main tank to die and chains death to other raid members.
---
Pros: Top 3 (imo #1) game ever made
---
Cons: Constantly thinking about hopping on WoW while spending quality time doing other perfectly lovely activities. The addiction notion is real.
---
You can dispel, and also warriors can stance dance to immune it..... However, some bosses spam fear, so you simpy need any fear immunity/removal you can get.... The second point is that it is super crucial to remove the fear ASAP, because bosses with cleave can literally kill at the melee in the whole raids in a swing....
---
The whole thing boiling down to fear on a tank beeing really bad and fear ward being the best possible answer to it... To the point where I preffer tanking on alliance over horde because of it.
---
I said as much in a different thread and got downvoted/chastised by the #nochanges crowd.
---
The Dungeon set as it stands is woefully inadequate on a majority of classes.  I mean yes, you can farm the dungeon set and you are essentially "ready" for Molten Core, but these days with all the BiS lists for each phase and everything, people are way more picky and not to mention know that the dungeon set "bonuses" aren't that great...
---
However, the itemization of the tier .5 set is way better, the set bonuses are reveresed (so the 2 and 4 piece bonuses are actually decent in case you don't want to wear the full set).
---
But I do understand that a lot of the summon drop tables are...for lack of a better term "OP". (I know for a fact that every caster wanted that staff that drops from the UBRS summoned boss in "The Beasts" room.

I just wish Blizzard would stop listening so hard to the #nochanges crowd.  I don't see how repeating ALL the mistakes of the past is going to make things better in the long term.
---
Yet nothing is more toxic than a player who leveled a dearf and found out they hated it
---
I wouldn't level it *before* your main, but there is a neat no-brainer trick you can do while leveling your main.
---
Start your alt and acrue rested EXP inside an inn while you're on your main - then once in a while when you're bored on your main or whatever, log on your alt and expend the rested exp with some grinding and log back out.
---
Might not be for everyone, but I plan to do that.
---
For example, the Mage pre-raid bis list has the Bloodvine crafting but ZG won't be out at launch
---
How can you hate the master race
---
I honestly don't even know if you have to login to a specific character on retail. On retail the rule is like 2 expansions (usually about 4 years?) of no account subscription rather than actually logging into individual characters afaik. Sources below:

Now for Classic this could very well be different, which was my point, because if the sub in fact is shared with retail (I believe this is confirmed more or less) then people might make names on week 1 and then never login to Classic again, but continue to be active retail players. That's the tricky part, because whereas if someone plays retail they can hold their names indefinitely by having an active sub, it's close to saying if someone plays hearthstone their retail wow toons should be held. They may very well play retail and then never play classic again after week 1, as they separate products in all reality. Sorry for the ramble.
---
I dont think thats possible. I think that wishing for those things is akin to chasing a high. Many of the reasons Vanilla legends exist is due to naivete at the time. I think there will be new pvp gods, but because everyone is a "content creator" nowadays there will be many more people vying for that title.  Information sharing is way easier now than in 2004 so I imagine every aspect of the game will be refined to a science, elitism may not be pervasive right at launch, but I bet you a couple months in it will be incredibly prevalent. I for one am just hoping that private server numbers are VERY wrong and it causes people to struggle with mechanics. That doesn't mean Classic will be worse than Vanilla, it just means that it will be different and that is okay. 
---
Or you just stack up the best comsumes and raidlog in a good guild :p
---
If you are a TRUE RP PvP player...you will reroll, regardless of "months of investment".
---
The most populated one is accelerating patch release schedule because they are closing when classic releases. 
---
I am looking forward to helping lower levels in dungeons once I am a bit higher level.
---
Me and a friend usually boosted people for free (Or we wanted the cloth from SM etc but they got the rest) and people remember you for it. 
---
Sure, I want to try my hand at raiding this time around but I am not gonna lie.. I am way more excited to boost low levels again :D
---
then /who thezone and whisper random warlocks tell them you pay gold if they can form a party to summon you
---
That's my guess. Usually on days with Blue posts, or days immediately after, we'll see a spike of subs.
---
I can't agree more. The whole "feel" of the combat is dependent on it imo. I was so disappointed to not find a way to go back to the old combat text after they implemented the new animations
---
Take your upvote you Shakespearean bastard!
---
I was literally thinking about that this weekend. My main is going to be a troll, I am so hoping the sublime joke gets put back in.
---
They won't be related. If they would want to release it befoer Classic we would very likely already have a release date or at the very least the beta would already be here.
---
So far we have no data on when WC3:R will be out except it will be this year and according to some information the game has to come out by November 2nd since some countries law says that a game than can be preordered has to come out within one year of pre orders starting.
---
My guess is Classic WoW in early to mid summer and
---
Warcraft 3 Reforged in early to mid fall. One quarter apart.
---
Yaaay!! Will main hunter. For the Huntard!
---
Weirdly, I feel like nobody understood your point.
---
You want the raid to be challenging. You feel like raiding with consumable makes the encounter too easy. Too much dps too much HP. 
---
It's quite similar to the argument people have to remove 16 debuffs slots and progressive itemisation and 1. 12 talent bering more op. 
---
Yet, you don't want to be in a casual guild raiding once or twice a week without a fixed line-up and with a big chunk of people maybe not that skilled.
---
I would gladly join your guild! 
---
Yeeh bro, honestly a good tune
---
T0.5 should be available during BWL IMO
---
Zg is fine too, but any time after that its too late and there is no point aside making them very few pve non raider players have to wait needlessly for their "end game"
---
Most private server veterans roll on to new servers as they get dropped anyway so they are used to and expect fresh starts on new servers. 
---
was he hot ?
---
How is that any different? If you're prone to ooming halfway through a fight, you'll be reducing your DPS either by downranking or being unable to cast. The final result is the same, you're not doing enough damage compared to the mages.
---
And by the way, the DPS is also a problem. Fireball has higher base damage than Starfire while having the same cast time. Ignite is better than increased crit damage. Improved Scorch is better than Nature's Grace and so is Winter's Chill. Mages also get 6% less spell resist from talents and access to better gear.
---
The bottom line is that a group of 5 mages will do more combined DPS than a group of 4 mages and a boomkin.
---
Idk what weapon you're thinking of but Carapace Spine Crossbow, Barbarous Blade, and the rend swords (shame on you if you get rend swords on a hunter but I digress) are all non-quest items.
---
World of Roguecraft would like to have a word. 
---
Nobbel does some good lore videos. I had the same thought process when they announced that Game of Thrones season 8 wasn't coming out for 2 years back in 2017. I've found the best way to get over waiting for something is to try and find other things to be excited for in the mean time. Sometimes this means trying games that you otherwise wouldn't, sometimes it means consuming other entertainment.  It'll be here before you know it, I still remember when the announcement happened, and that was a year and a half ago. Try not to focus on it. 
---
Beta or why they opted against one. 
---
Dungeon set 2 needs to be released earlier than AQ, such a good quest line for non-raiders even if most of the gear sets are generalist and not built for any specific spec.
---
Good video
---
Exactly. Finally no more corrupted server owners. No more shaddy gold seller business. 
---
Thanks 
---
God i hope there is, it was bad enough playing a hunter way back when with 400ms.
---
Would be nice to experience it without the huge delay affecting deadzone and when you could "be in range"
---
Amound of realms,  realm types and realm names.
---
Farq was damn scary. No soup for you!
---
More or less. Having a couple of full T2 hunters and the rest with full T1 seems close to ideal.
---
There's an argument for this weird half T2.5 build for the non T2 hunters pre-naxx as well but that's a small upgrade if at all.
---
This obviously took some serious time, research and planning. 
---
Many thanks for dedication to help others.

You're the saddest bunch I've ever met
---
And you haven't even got  BiS pre-raid blues
---
Yet somehow I'll make a Wpvp'er out of youuuuuuuuu!
---
I want a realm list so we can start coordinating where to roll already.
---
Also - I think it would be awesome if Blizz could figure out a way to give early access for character creation only.  So once servers are announced, you can actually create a character (name and customize) without actually logging onto the server.  This would happen 1 or 2 weeks prior to release.
---
I imagine pservers will come up again couple years after release. Blizzard can´t open new servers just like that so there is room for pservers to fill that. 
---
They are all pserver fanbois of tips so they downvoted your credible reply.
---
You are 100% correct in your assessment, and it is a shame that people follow those videos like the bible.  
---
In the defense of the players he interviews, no matter what version or “variation” of the game they are playing, they are certainly the top echelon.  I tanked with skarm yesterday in a pug and his threat production (albeit super geared), mitigation techniques, and raid protection was amazing.  I was impressed by macro swapping between pulls based on pack composition/boss pulls.  It was cool to see.
---
As a priest/rogue who raided up to 4H in classic though, no I will not be following those guides.
---
Its bring tears to my eyes every time
---
Exactly.  As it stands, releasing .5 where they currently plan to release it makes it all but useless for the most casual of casual non-raiders.  I'll still go for it, purely as a completionist, but I have no doubt, especially this time around; if they stick to their current timeline; not many people will find the gear useful since more people will probably be fully geared in either ZG/AQ20 gear or BWL gear.
---
Whoops.  Don't drink and math, kids.
---
:o someone gets it! huzzah!
---
but alas, we are but a few, oh well, just a thought \^\^
---
Classic.
---
That folder will be deleted
---
If you multibox level 2 at a time.
---
Rogue - engenering + leatherworking
---
Mage - mining skinning
---
If you level 1 at a time go for
---
Rogue - skinning mining
---
Mage - skinning mining
---
Sell leather but keep the mining mats.
---
Once 60 drop mining and skinning on rogue and take engenering and leatherworking.
---
Use the saved up mats for engenering and level it.
---
Buy the skinning mats from AH because farming then yourself is worth less per hour than farming gold on your main and buy the mats.
---
Bear tanking is possible. You wont be the main tank of the guild, but be at least a viable off tank. 
---
Most of the other specs can be made to work to some degree if you put the work in e.g. balance druid or shadow priest. Imo the only really dead specs are prot paladin and enhanc shaman im pve. 
---
PvP implementation and realm list.
---
Watching this gives me goosebumps
---
Seems like a more solid analysis than my quick napkin math!  Plus this part:
---
&gt; Where are those 100+ million players from 2005-2013? Let's say that 90% of them don't have time to play games (jobs, families) or they are playing other games. There is still over 10 million left. Heck, let's say that 95% of them, for whatever reason, won't return to Classic. But there are still 5 million left. And let's be honest here...even 90% is a highly pessimistic percentage.
---
This doesn't even factor in the "next generation" of players, as it were.
---
yeah  I was thinking of the MC epic sorry
---
anyway you could use the time instead of losing rolls in ubrs if it even drops to get gold for assassination blade/dawns edge boes for the 2% crit
---
You can always decide to go tank. You will need to get into a good guild though.
---
&gt;All of the numbers and drop rates, including gold farming, mats farming and BiS farming where based on private server statistics.
---
So how does drop rate have anything to do with the play style of a certain class?
---
My guess is that you'll see a sharp decline in Vanilla Pserver communities but an increase in the TBC/WOTLK pserver communities.
---
I mean personally the only thing preventing me from playing pservers is the simple fact that I want to support blizzard, not some people who are trying to gouge the community by allowing people to buy the Blades of Azzinoth on their rogue...
---
You're right in that I'd say a majority of vanilla enthusiasts will probably go to classic, but those that refuse will move onto later timeline projects as I mentioned.
---
You couldnt pay me to roll with a absurdly well-practiced guild that will 1 shot every boss on launch. Yes, less farming becoz less wipes, but my god raidlogging to faceroll content, i might as well play retail lol
---
Coming fresh off a trip overseas with a month off afterward I hope this is the case.
---
Aren’t all affliction spells shadow?
---
I can’t think right now 
---
The day classic is out I will never log on to pserver again.
---
I like boogie, but this seems pretty short sighted
---
When heirlooms were created, at first it was just a shoulder slot item that gave a 10% boost up to level 60, and that was it.  At the time the level max was 80, and most of us were begging blizzard to find a way to abreiviate the levelling process for those of us who had done it the hard way multiple times.  Blizzard made heirlooms because we begged for them, they can't be faulted for that. 
---
 Also, dungeon finder (I'm talking about retail here, it has no place in classic) is a way for blizzard to ensure that people actually get to see their legacy content.  Otherwise most players wouldnt go to the trouble of organizing groups to run dungeons, it wouldn't be worth the time while levelling.  I'd bet that 75% of current retail players never manually gathered a dungeon group before they got to the latest content expansion.  
---
If you want the answer to the question...;
---
&gt; Do you feel like you need to really play out your characters anger towards the other (f)action, gathering your guild to overthrow the scums that murdered your friends?
---
... as 'yes', then join my guild on a pvp server. Didn't realize we were RPing this whole time!
---
Server names, and a confirmation of the release time. is it going to be midnight release in Europe, morning release etc.
---
Totes get where you're coming from
---
I found  some more item alternatives here google dhralla's hunter guide
---
Slightly OT but the worst thing about Warlocks in retail is how bloody short the DoTs are! 
---
I will probably try to avoid servers that big streamers are on, despite them being less likely to die, I don't want to play with people that play to flame/follow streamers. 
---
Just gotta wait for that sweet TBC expansion in \~2-3 years. :D
---
I'd roll alliance druid if I could stomach being alliance.  Alliance druid bear/cat forms are just SO MUCH BETTER than the horde druid bear/cat forms.
---
The dual boxing part seems iffy.  
---
Getting a second account for a mage to port yourself around is fine tough.  
---
As far as professions go, however, you shouldn't focus on them early on. I would focus on getting the mage to 60 first so I can assist the rogue. You'll be able to easily make up for the gold loss from skipping professions by aoe grinding in brd.
---
Warriors are easier/faster than Rogues/Paladins if you know what you're doing.
---
This 100 %
---
It will be a fresh start. All names will be available. They've already stated that Classic will have zero connection whatsoever to the current expansion.
---
how should i play as rogue vs orc warrior?

It’s perfectly normal to go through a few guilds before you find the right one for you

I was on azjol back in the day, after tbc it was full of sweatys in the PvP scene 🙄 I'm pretty sure during wrath there was a DK comp in 3s that was one of the highest rated in Europe mid way through wrath. Can't remember names though. Also I was alliance, we may have fought ✌️
---
I mean, balanced doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want and "shine".. If you can do everything right with your class and still not be able to carry your weight in raids and be useless in all aspects of pvp, then that would be actual imbalance. By this definition there is no imbalance.
---
they are juicy
---
but you can still wipe than that effort is for nothing like you only got 1 shot to get value out of
---
except ZGs
---
 Miiind blooown! But yeah, if there's no RP-PvP server. One poor server will be elected as the unofficial RP-PvP server. So might be yours!
---
Servers, types, how many and pop size.
---
Any intervention in place for faction balance.
---
Are character services applied to vanilla too, e. G. Can I faction change.
---
If servers will go into battle groups or is it server only bgs. 
---
There is a channel for guild recruiting on most of the classic discords. If i were you, I would read through the posts and look for one that is sparking your interest. Normaly they have own discords with people hanging around, talking about classic or doing other stuff. So that would be a good way to to get to know them as person before release.
---
I plan to play a rogue that doesn't know my spec.
---
Bruh we're private server players. Rerolling to the next server is a regular occurrence for us.
---
"Easy"...but I bet there is a good majority of this sub who never saw TBC content when it was actually live...

Nah no official word yet, but I do agree I think they either gotta do like seasonal servers like D3 or go to tbc/1.13
---
This picture is hilarious
---
Cross realm BGs because it's a deal breaker
---
I am going to be hated for what I say but here it is: 
---
My biggest enjoyment out of Vanilla was how pure the game was and how I knew nothing about it, neither anyone really when I started playing. And tbh noone knew much by the end of it either. I mean the amount of theorycrafting people have went through the past 14 years is crazy.
---
If I was you as a new player, I wouldn't look at any guides or anything, I'd just start playing classic and enjoy. Create any class no matter if its good for pve or pvp etc and just enjoy the whole experience. At a later stage maybe you can look at a guide or something like that, but unless you join some hardcore guild that requires you to watch and read everything previously you won't have any issues. We were pushing in the top 10 in the world back then and believe me the raid leader at some point in chromaggus had to teach us the fight by telling us go in, go out, do this , do that like we were some kind of children. Same goes with most fights tbh, never had to read a guide or anything, or the need to be a super pro player that focuses on everything. It went fine and it was fun.
---
My 5 cents is skip as many guides as you can and just pick up things by playing the game.
---
Nah its mostly personal
---
I would disagree and say Mage/Lock.
---
Hunter is actually fairly gear dependent as physical damage classes are extremely reliant on having a good weapon.
---
Hunters can kite classes forever, but having a bad weapon is really going to impact your damage.
---
Damn. I can only imagine the feeling seeing the bones of Sapphiron for the first time 🤤
---
What happened to your name tho? I’ve been following other pics you posted and your name in those was Silverlight? Was name change available at some point in Vanilla? 
---
do the maths
---
let say it take you 10/days played to max a lv60 say a mage that wont need any gear upgrades to aoe farm dme ( which Idk if it even be viable in clasic now?)
---
so you spend 240h leveling
---
in that time with your shitty main lets say a warrior you make normally 30g/hour so that time could be spent farming over 7k gold
---
but then the mage could farm say 50g/hour and thats close to double but you have to play it A LOT to make up for lost time leveling it. So long term its worth it but is long term with your own playtime? 6month? a year? anyway classic servers should last forever the dev said so it can be a worth while investment but I advice to make the farmer something you actually like so u can even do altruns in raid with it or pvp.. like try to get more value out of it not just for farming.
---
What?  I don't know or care.  The point I was making was a distinction between abilities used while flagged [combat].  Why change the specific point to a different one (my knowledge of popular PvP class and reasoning behind said choice) instead of technical definition of in vs out of combat based on state of character in game and what abilities are usable in and out of said state.  Stealth cannot be entered into while combat flagged unless one uses a COMBAT usable ability first to drop the [combat] flag, thereby leaving combat and allowing the use of the NON-COMBAT ability once again.  Or have I missed a step someplace and is there a talent that allows a rogue or druid to enter stealth without a [combat] removal ability?  Or is the ability [stealth] usable while flagged and without an extra ability used before you press it?
---
Plan on getting a shaman to 60 where I can try to be a completionist. Of course, I won’t succeed, but it’s worth attempting! I’ll have a hunter alt for farming gold. Might have Druid and rogue alts as well. Druid for herbalism, rogue for gnomish engineering/mining for profession support with my shaman’s alchemy/goblin engineering. 
---
I wanted to stay on the very conservative and pessimistic side, using percentages that aren't acceptable by any sort of statistical method. I mean, 90-95% is a percentage that is never used by statistical methods.
---
But, I wanted to use it, to point out the massive potential for Classic, because even with 95% of former WoW players  not coming back to Classic, there is still a 5% that will.
---
Adding players from other former MMORPGs that failed in the last 10+ years and players that are brand new to MMORPGs and gaming in general is a viable option...but there is no way to know how many of them will stick to Classic.
---
So, I rather left them outside of my projection, which even with a 95% non-returning players, there are still 5 million players that will come back.
---
I think offering up Seasonal Servers could be neat, but they would need to clearly label which ones are seasonals and which ones are permanent well in advance.
---
Which one is that?
---
Will be hard to get Legolas. But I think a good old Légôlàrs should be doable for a hunter. On the serious note, all not censored names will be available without any link to the retail servers. 
---
For the mass of guides he puts out, his guidance comes off as quite toolbaggy. Like he's offering advice sounding like it's shit you and everybody else should already know. Meh, there's loads of others out there to get lost in. It's just personal preference.
---
You'll be fine. Feral Druids were/are able to tank all the 5 mans. You'll probably end up being an offtank in raids though.
---
Having an alt to farm is hardcore gaming
---
Corruption/Nightfall/Shadowbolt bro. Only one slot. 
---
Oh hell no, server wipes are a huge dealbreaker.
---
I think all they need to do now is bring back the "Level 20 Free Trial" they they used to offer around the start of TBC to hook some of the folks who might be interested but not willing to take the plunge into a subscription.
---
True story 
---
Very good to know and something new players need to be aware of. 
---
Private servers are not accurate and cannot be had to bar your expectations off of. They were full of guess work and wrong values. 
---
I think a good portion of people don't save their money for their 40 mount.
---
I don't think wiping servers keeps content "fresh". We are already allowed to create alts.
---
I would rather see some servers upgrade through BC and Wrath (let's stop there, thanks), with some stopping at BC maybe and definitely some locked on Vanilla forever. Though I think separating the community with BC and Wrath is a poor idea as that would thin out the population too much.
---
I think the best option is completely static.
---
Also not to mention that private servers aren't accurate of what vanilla wow is and what classic will be. 
---
Any normal guild will not care what you wear. 
---
This is most obviously not a pserver screenshot
---
No, Activision did not remove people from the WoW team, nor put their own people in.
---
There may not be tons of people left who worked on the original game, but that'd have more to do with normal turnover and the fact that the game released 15 years ago (and started development around 20 years ago).
---
Stealth talents aren't necessary you can use some of the rogue shoes that improve stealth, like Darkmantle shoes, or green version (weaker) Nightscape boots.
---
Druid as 5 man tank is in good shape. Open world leather grinding is not too bad. No need to talk you out. Go for it. Played heal Druid as main during Vanilla in PvP and PvE. It was blast.
---
I have a circle of friends that I play all kinds of games with. Rust, Apex Legends, LoL.... 95% of my circle of friends are people I met on wow classic almost 15 years ago. The game was literally life changing. I am sorry that you missed it. 
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1172
---
mind u some classes barely use more than a piece or two of tier gear when actually raiding so those people equip it  just in the city to look nice to the noobs
---
Can't name private servers here.
---
No. MANY values are off. It is very different and breeds very different okay styles. There was a lot of guess work, and the most guys even admitted they were way off. 
---
I can't argue in if they were the same players from classic, and I'm not sure how you pulled that "fact" out of thin air. But the reality is that no one truly remembers how vanilla was so it's easy to see p servers as being close, but they're so far off. 
---
For example, the hamstring strategy for warriors if AWFUL and will leave you rage starved. But it can to be popular because of broken private servers making it viable. And even then it really 
---
 is. Once we switch over to blizzards guaranteed and proven math and knowledge, we will have a smooth experience that can't have strategies based off of bugs. 
---
It's not much fun to level an alt when nobody is leveling with you, and that will happen eventually on these servers unless sub numbers steadily climb,  which I doubt. Nobody wants to level on a server where it's effectively a single player game. Vanilla is mostly about leveling with other people, and if you want that 2-3 years after the server releases, you need fresh servers.
---
I get your idea and I like it, but for most people, using consumes is to enhance their performance and in of itself is a fun thing, but at the same time it would be cool to do the content like this. Problem is finding likeminded people. Going through MC-Naxx the average guild will likely need at least 80-100 different individuals considering the falloff between raids, the unavoidable drama and unforseen irl circumstances. Finding those people with the same mindset will be the real challenge.
---
I don´t think the demand for those are high enough. There are not enough no-lifers to fill a server in every region. 
---
Blizzard have oceanic servers for all of their IPs, so I don't see any reason why they would break that trend with Classic. Even if there wasn't much demand in the region, they're still pretty keen to make their games accessible 
---
majority of eastern eu and chinese players are the same age loll and have the same money to drop.vv america and eu didnt age in a vacuum.
---
I came back to retail about 2 months ago. And recently just left. Waiting for classic. I can't do it anymore. My level 93 Blood Elf Warlock is not the same. It's all about the lvl 60 female rogue in Ironforge on my Sabre 😎
---
I'm not saying add content, and I'm not saying they should delete servers. I'm saying that eventually there will be 0 people leveling on these servers. Leveling is the biggest part of vanilla, and in order to experience it with a group of people instead of being solo, you need fresh servers to be released.
---
I want to snipe the name of a streamer to piss them off. 
---
well drop rates change how easily you gain quest items, new gear, items to sell, profession leveling. 
---
The point is that private servers were made with incorrect information. Literal guess work. Small tiny fractions of a % can dramatically change the game. 
---
For example private servers have increased spawn rates because of increased player counts on one server. This makes mage AEO farming easier than it was in retail, makes warriors lives harder because the aggro ranges aren't consistent or clearly define and new enemies spawn too fast. 
---
The numbers were literally guessed in some instances. You can't base your knowledge off incorrect information. 
---
I'm not entirely sure what the story behind it was, I just know he made a comment that it didn't work out.
---
&gt; If you aren't playing on an RP server, literally no one will ever stop in Stormwind and comment "nice gear bro" on you, so this is literally a non issue. 
---
had it happen to my shamans and warlocks on pvp servers
---
it does happen
---
Boar was my main choice on pservers. Good tank, good HP and armor and instant aggro with his charge. When you get your hands on Broken Tooth or Lupus go for them. 
---
It's a p server bug. That's why we need to be careful with what information we try to bSe strategies off of. 
---
I hadn’t heard that they were not considering an rppvp server? 
---
I have at least 15 friends who are all interested in rolling on an Rppvp server. Until this moment that was our plan all along. 
---
Because it's a great way to get out in front of the kinds of assumptions people tend to make, and it's a great way to present the second half of an argument.
---
Consider:
---
&gt; I'm not the biggest fan of mint ice cream
---
Maybe you would assume I dislike it.
---
&gt; I'm not the biggest fan of mint ice cream.  That being said, I wouldn't turn it down, if offered.
---
That second statement clarifies that while it isn't my favorite, I don't actively *dislike* it, either.
---
I wouldn’t play retail if Blizzard paid me

So as someone who recently mained a druid and leveled on to 60 on a private server I don't want to discourage you from playing a pretty awesome and unique class but I will give you some realism here. While questing I couldn't have had more fun as a druid, I would switch between balance and feral for the memes and you can fill literally any dungeon slot while you're questing so finding groups is quick and easy. Your pvp is pretty lack luster but being a gimped rogue is often enough to get the job done, but it's pretty easy to just root if you're opened on. The real problem though starts at Max level, I wanted to heal in raids so I went resto but if I wanted to go back to feral to farm or tank dungeons or whatever it would cost alot of gold because of the 50g max Respec cost in classic and I'm not a class that can really farm gold too easily so I really found my self not being able to switch realistically. I was basically stuck in resto spec for alot of the time just because I lacked the gold income to spend 100g extra a week just to switch to feral and back and so I basically just became a gimped holy priest. I really couldn't do anything but heal at max and druids are the worst hps in the game. If you are really committed to the game you can really make druid work at max but as a casual player I wouldn't recommend it.

Until the people going all in gets tired of the cheapskates and leave for a "better" guild.
---
There are people with Blizzard currently who worked on the original team developing vanilla WoW.
---
From what we know, the two guys who did the Classic presentation at Blizzcon were on the original team developing vanilla.
---
Blizzard is a separate entity who develops their own stuff, although as time goes on it seems that their overall business direction &amp; game design is serving the goals of Activision's. (Which kinda makes sense.)
---
The first bullet point under the pre purchase area of the us.shop.battle.net website “Pre-purchase: Warcraft® III: Reforged releases on or before December 31, 2019.”
---
I got bored leveling completely on my own. The server I was on was so old that the leveling zones became empty. After 3 years on a classic server, unless wow gets steadily climbing sub numbers which I doubt, the leveling zones are going to become mostly empty. Leveling is a major part of the vanilla experience and to keep it from becoming a mostly single player game you need fresh servers. This isn't a controversial idea, pretty much every private server does this after a while.
---
Please either stay away, or clearly mark what is private server information. There is a very good chance it will differ from the actuality of Classic. Many strategies are based on private server bugs or mad math, which won't exist in classic. 
---
I think it's important for new players do be aware of this distinction 
---
Maybe.  I think it's the sort of thing they could gauge interest in once we're a year or two out from launch.  See how many folks are still playing and see how many want fresh starts.
---
I feel you're trying to combine the proactive player that strives to learn and get better who everyone can lean on and trust in clutch situations, with the type of player that wouldn't want to do everything they can to get an edge to make the former possible.
---
I think it's an awesome idea and some people may be down.  But finding players with that specific mentality sounds like a crap shoot.  If you want this idea to work, I 100% think you need to have the guild already formed before launch because you're not going to find this luckily on a single server.
---
Good luck though, sounds like a YouTube series I'd watch.
---
I know right? its horrible how hard it is to get their preraid bis
---
its nice that they last a long time like you play half a year maybe more with lionheart and the epic legs and those gloves
---
I'm NA PVP Orc Warlock looking for exactly this but I'm only available at or after 10pm EST. Let me know if you think that could work :) 
---
Have a TON of raiding experience in TBC and WOTLK. Looking to bring my raid skill to new experiences. 
---
twitch.tv/ginsanityy
---
My current pserver raid group has aroud 8 resto shamans and 2 priests. Shaman is cool. 
---
I actually did that on a pserver in BC, it was pretty fun
---
tank 5 mans - druids are the best 5man tanks, better than warriors, cos druids do more damage, and have more utility. 
---
openworld questing/grinding/ganking - questing in terms of leveling top speed only behind hunter; grinding - soso they aren't the highest damage its ok i guess, pros are mobility and fluidity; ganking at 60 not the best, depends on the class/gear you are facing and if they got a healing capabilities, which own druids cos no interupt and you won't really be able to stunlock ppl, druids are good at escaping though.
---
heal raids - whatever, druids are the worst healer, so don't expect much, 1-2 druids brought to raids purily for utility. they more of a supprot than healer.
---
battleground - exclusively flagcarry role - they are the best class for it in game, pretty much suck at everything else. you won't really be able to catform someone in wotlk style, it doesnt work like that in vanilla, healing in bgs is super weak aswell cos you don't have fast cast heal, and vanilla dps is very bursty, hots dont do much, and you need to stand in human form and cast long cast, you are super squishy in human. so ya flagcarrying -big ya, everything else is really bad.
---
Ah yes! How could I forget.
---
I mean your not wrong, but other than hazy memories and very little solid video footage we don't have much to go off of, and I will say it still feels pretty close in most ways having played it
---
Changed server, guild - there's a big gap in dates here.
---
Some human paladin or something had my proper name on the server I went to.  SilverLight is taken almost everywhere these days. :(
---
Good thinking. The majority of the information in the guides were written for private servers and I just assumed it would all be the same since classic will be released on 1.12 as well - I'll certainly make a note of that. Thanks!
---
It was already in 1.12, was it not?
---
I imagine they'll just cross that bridge when they get there
---
We don´t know about pet normalization yet. Most hunters liked it back then. They could go for exotic pets and not feel gimped. 
---
Well it's your definition of cool anyway.
---
When you have finally gathered all the pieces or armor that you prefer the most in terms of look, then why not allowing you permanently have it on your character, since it fits your own fantasy, which is also part of the "cool" definition? (and add in a few details like disabling that feature in BGs or whatever)
---
...TIL a quiver increases wand speed.
---
Oil? Do you even shaman, bro?
---
If that's the case, why don't we have the Chinese undead models over here? 
---
That poor guy keeps getting jobs then thrown out the window. I’d have given up by now.
---
Which Exo are you looking for? Class/race?
---
I really don’t think that values matter. Hardcore private server players will probably perform much better than old vanilla players. There’s a reason why they’re considered to be one of the best players, even if this is on private servers. If certain tactics or strategies don’t work, they will have to adapt, just like any other player.
---
NA servers?  No one on the back end selling characters/gold/items?
---
Shut up and take my money.
---
The goal was to be the first there while everybody is still lvl 40ish, so no lock for me ;-)
---
I will try again this evening, but instead of rezzing at the graveyard because it made the trip shorter I will stay on the road.
---
That's what i meant by battlechest
---
I couldn't have said that better. Wish I could upvote more.
---
What about the fear of having the server shut down, without warning, at any moment? 
---
&gt; Anyone that plays rust recognizes the advantages of periodic wipes to keep content fresh.
---
Actually, wipes are one of the reasons I don't like Rust.  The whole point of this game is progressively growing and collecting.  A forced wipe is antithetical to that.
---
This is so overstated. If you know what you're doing you level one faster than a rogue or paladin. 
---
I think this will naturally solve itself with regard to flasks at least. Black Lotus has what? A 9 minute respawn timer on pservers? In Classic it’ll be back to the 1 hour respawn timer. To top that off, the entire player base won’t all be on one server ensuring it’s all harvested 100% of the time. However, just to illustrate - even if every single node were harvested you’d be going from around 576 per day down to 96 per day. Having 1/6 the supply will cause the price to go up dramatically making it much harder to actually get. This is why you mostly only saw hardcore guilds flasking tanks back in the day - not because they were dumb and didn’t realize flasks were useful.
---
As for world buffs, I think the cool down will have a bigger effect than people think and it’ll once again primarily be relegated to increasing clear speeds on farm raids - not for progress raids.
---
I'll most likely play frost Mage on a PvP server. What's the best profession choice?
---
I initially wanted tailoring+skinning, but based on what I read it seems that engineering is by far the most recommended profession.
---
1.12
---
This is me at my job. Ofc they don't throw me threw the windows but let's say that I will never be promoted or get a raise ...
---
It's a big problem of me : I just can't lick asses like everybody else !
---
It's your world, I just live in it.  Lol
---
&gt; but hardly anyone actually uses them
---
except pvpers
---
priest like you said
---
rogues and hunters
---
tank warriors
---
paladins and shaman for t3
---
Wolf for general purpose and dungeons giving melee damage bonus for tank and melee via furious howl. 
---
Broken Tooth for pvp. That attack speed to interrupt casting and proc’ing frenzy faster as a BM hunter to increase the speed another 30% is just too awesome. 
---
Lastly, I always get one of my favourite rare pets. Pink flamingo, Mazzranache or white gorilla, Uhk’loc.  Bird for fun or gorilla for helping guildies do low level dungeons on their alts for the aoe damage via thunder stomp. 
---
The ones I mentioned first are the best to go with imo before the epic quest. As a hunter you'll need items on par with them to beat the epic quest anyway, it's no joke!
---
Every aspect of this game is based on MATH. 
---
The amount of dps a rotation does is math. The amount of damage mitigation a tank can gain from specific abilities is math. BIS items are best in slot because of values and how they impact your character.. based on math. 
---
If the values are wrong, the math is wrong. If the math is wrong, the game doesn't play the same way. 
---
They're the best because they know how to use the platform in front of them the best way possible.
---
It's like they made a second race track to replicate an older racetrack but they only had drawn maps and memories to go off of, so they had to guess the angle of the corners. You can be an expert on that replica, but if the corners aren't exactly the same as the original you can expect your strategy and racing line to carry over. 
---
Literal goosebumps...
---
Yeah it's possible that they are closer than we think. But! It's at least good to make the information and distinction part of your guide so people can have that idea and recognize why things might change a bit
---
Rhymes with Knight's Slope.
---
I thought having to play with high ping on a West Coast server from the East or something, little did I know it wouldn't even be an option at all.  Womp womp 
---
Yeah but can you actually make 35G an hour with a prot war, a holy priest / paladin etc ?
---
Holy crap why did I cry too! Ahhh
---
Mot what I'm referring to.
---
Right now on pservers you can type /camp to start logging out and during the 20 seconds it takes to log out you then type /resetinstance() and it resets the instance while you are still inside. Then when you log back in you are outside of the instance entrance.
---
Yea, but everyone is on an even “playing field” if everything was different. Vanilla players from 2005ish have no real recollection of values or strategies. Even if they did, it won’t take long for the hardcore private server players to catch up. As I said before, most of the hardcore pserver players also played during real vanilla. On an even playing field, the more dedicated player ( or hardcore player) will win anyway. Some values will probably be off, but plenty of things will also be the same. Not much will change and in the end the ones with the most experience will be better in the beginning (those who’ve played it on pservers). 
---
Bears don’t benefit from windfury, but they do benefit from might. Between this and salvation, Alliance have the better bear tanks.
---
A part of the community always begs and complains. A lot of people didn't ask for Heirlooms. I sure as hell didn't ask for it. Walking around with the same equipment for 60 levels. Even when was just a chest and shoulder piece. It ruins the feeling of progression.
---
And me as an 11 year old kid could get a group together with my shitty English. If people didn't bother to group up it must be a lack of interest.  
---
The quests alone were reason enough for me to explore the dungeons.
---
Both those things you mention were a game/community killer for me.
---
I think a lot of Blizzard faults comes from actualy listening to all the complaining people on the forum.
---
I played a Hunter in vanilla. It was my only max level character until WotLK.
---
Hunters are least gear-dependent AND easiest to level. You get a decent tank early on.
---
And believe it or not, Aspect of the Cheetah is amazing until you get your first mount. (Which was a long time in vanilla.)
---
And if you get good at kiting, and trapping, you can still impress other players. Easy to learn, hard to master.
---
The fears used by raid bosses are a physical effects, they cannot be dispelled with paladin or priest dispels.
---
&gt;but my god raidlogging to faceroll content, i might as well play retail lol
---
I mean, no one is Facerolling mythic raids in retail. 
---
Where are you farming ~60g/hr in pre-MC/Ony gear?
---
I know, right! I didn't know anything about him but kept seeing him pop up in my YouTube feed. Curiously, I clicked to see what it was all about. 
---
I legit couldn't finish the video. The guy acts like he has some form of mental damage or Tourette's. I could feel my myself getting dumber as I watched. My brain cells shrunk as they cringed with each facial expression and word that escaped his gaping, slack jawed maw.
---
And people complain about Tips...
---
Anything that makes this sub loose their shit. Aka, anything at all.
---
No I don't, peon.
---
They pretty much invalidated every previous expansion with every new one.  It’s bizarre it took them until WoD to offer expansion relevant level boosts.  In hind sight, they really should have had Draenei/Blood Elves exit their starter zones at 58, Death Knights at 68, and pandas at 85.  Cataclysm also should have turned old world Azeroth from 1-60 to 1-80.  
---
Part of the appeal of classic is that there is just so much content from beginning to end.  With every expansion afterward, that content became more and more of a drag as the newly developed content got you from the level cap of the last expansion to the new one in like 20 hours played, and then started you on a gear treadmill.  
---
WotLK hit the loot grind just about right in my opinion.  I COULD grind heroics all day and eventually get the last tier’s raid stuff, or I could just raid and get the latest stuff now.  Retail, last I played, was either grinding an island or grinding a queue.  It just wasn’t fun, and even seeing the story play out in raids didn’t alleviate the fact I only got there with 2 dozen other people people being anonymous jerks because cross-realm shenanigans.
---
The point I'm making is that NEW players need to be aware that private servers have created strategies and information based on literal bugs. 
---
A value being off is a bug. Curt being increased when sitting is a bug. 
---
You can't expect to go into a game knowing how to abuse bugs that literally won't exist. And we shouldn't let new players be misled by this wrong information. 
---
Values aren't just a mob having 10 more health. We're taking about incorrect percentages for attributions, incorrect calculations and algebraic formulas informing how the characters work which makes the work differently. 
---
You gotta remember it's just lines of code. If you put the wrong numbers it it WILL change how the game plays. For example, if the way hit % is generated is off by just one decimal in just one value of the equation, the entire ratio will be different from vanilla. 
---
Now spread this across the white board where they had to guess like crazy. 
---
Regonizing the video by the 140p quallity thumpnail.
---
I dont think were going to see a bunch of alts.  Leveling in vanilla was a slog.
---
That would be close to 40% less time to complete MC, how is that dumb? The people who do MC fast are not exactly thrilled to almost double the clearing time.
---
I would love to see united servers, but it has already been made clear that the distinction between NA and EU will persist. There's no reason why they can't have one RP-PvP server for EU and one for NA.

&gt;*"certainly in the larger regions"*
---
One RP-PvP realm is not going to suddenly up and die or become low pop - the demand is clearly sufficient for more; but sensible forward planning would suggest doing one per region not ten.
---
Druid is a wanted class because no mather the spec you can tank heal and dps dungeon till 60.
---
Also fun in open world and can be usefull in PvP by just rooting everyone.
---
Your posts are so asinine I just had to comment 
---
&gt; So, basically, they do not plan to have RP PvP servers at start, but if there will be enough demand for this type of servers, they are open to create them.
---
If you've been paying attention, this is the problem.
---
Classic may have a relatively small community in the first place. If there is no server at launch, what will happen? Server transfers from a random PvP server? Which server? How much money?
---
Reroll your character after months of playing? How many months?
---
How will they gauge demand for a server that *doesn't exist*? Without even one released?
---
There should be **at least one RPPvP server at launch.**
---
If Ion is genuine about "gauging interest" for an RPPvP server, then he needs to release one. He may be surprised, as "you think you do, but you don't" Blizzard has been surprised before.
---
This is correct. You also can't use track Humanoids at the same time as a gathering professions. So none-gathering professions can be better.
---
We have diccusions about what we want or should happens years from now every day.
---
I dont want to talk about it to much.
---
As an Alliance player, I also agree.
---
&gt;Having 1/6 the supply will cause the price to go up dramatically making it much harder to actually get.
---
If you have 1/6 of the population... 
---
That's just a terrible argument. That's like telling a PvP player "hey, there will be no PvP servers, just roll on a PvE server. But *maybe* there will be PvP servers *sometime in the future* and then you can maybe reroll!*
---
Can you not see how that could completely ruin someone's WoW experience?
---
Meh disagree.  Even back in vanilla days there was a HUGE contingent of people who wanted dedicated reroll servers.
---
Rerolling on a fresh server is a unique experience, it would be nice if blizz had rolling reroll servers that eventually went away to feed players into lower pop servers.
---
Yeah dirt poor eastern Europe and China was like 20 years ago.
---
They can certainly afford a WOW sub.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss
---
Very sad that Ion thinks there isn't interest for an RPPvP server where *the most recent surveys show greater interest than RPPvE servers.*
---
PvP is far more popular now than it used to be.
---
The thing is I think every class is amazing in TBC.  Played a hunter and that sweet sweet DPS was great.  Druid in arenas is probably money though ... hunter was a bit rough in arenas.
---
Can you imagine how much worse (yes even worse) the forums would be if blizzard never "listened to what the players want"?  I'm not saying that heirlooms and dungeon finder werent a mistake that lead (at least partially) to the pitiful state the game is in now.  I'm saying that *enough* players wanted those things, and that's why we have them.  
---
Also, if you don't like walking around with the same equipment for 60 levels - then don't.  You do not have to use heirlooms.  Go on  then - level without them if they ruins your experience, nobody will stop you.
---
Now we're talking, I want play Green TD and Element TD again.
---
&gt; I think the best option is completely static. 
---
If it stays completely static it will lose a large amount of its population within 2 years.
---
Fun fact: Wind Serpent was/is actually the best leveling pet on private servers. Due to lag/bad netcode, mobs can run past your pet without taunt being able to connect, leaving your mob chasing it and only catching up to taunt once the mob reaches you.
---
The Wind Serpent has the 20? yard range instant-cast nature damage attack so it draws aggro immediately and at range. With that said, it won't be a bad option for official Classic. The consistent armor shred from its instant cast nature damage attack is quite nice for grinding and PvP against high armor targets and to interrupt spellcasts at range.
---
Maraudon, strat live as 5men group, strad UD as tank keeping crates + green BoPs to DE, strat live as tank + healer, DM:N AoE or trib runs, DM:E AoE or duo runs, farming herbs/ores in offhours, crafting with rare patterns, flipping the AH, alchemy, tanking UBRS keeping blackdragon scales.
---
There are lots and lots of ways making quite the decent gold for experienced players in each phase of the progression.
---
Highly doubt it but Blizz hasn't said anything on this topic as fas as I know.

Heres a good bis list. You can see for yourself who uses tier gear as actual bis. The classes that want full tier are hunter, rogue and prot war (except t2.5 bc thats more of a dps set). Shaman wants full tier once they hit aq. Looks like priest also aims for full t1/t2 but skips t2.5
---
That being said you can for sure aim for full tier. Your damage/healing will still be good, just not the best. Youre going to see way more shamans rolling with tier sets bc its aesthetically pleasing while also still being good.
---
Firstly, there has **never** been transfers from PvE to PvP servers, because it would be an unfair advantage. So that precludes transfers from RPPvE servers.
---
So RP players need to roll on random PvP servers hedging their bets? Roll on two servers? What if you rolled on a low pop PvP server? Transfers have **never** been allowed *away* from low pop servers, only towards them? So what if you don't get trapped?
---
It's astonishing that people don't see these things. Not having your server choice at launch will be a very bad thing.
---
I have the exact same dilemma. I like warlock esthetics and tier sets way (way) better. Warlock leveling is very smooth, whereas mage leveling has a lot of downtime drinking and an amazingly boring rotation (in my opinion). Warlocks can crit huge numbers with SM/Ruin, in combination with surprise Nightfall procs for instant casts - that's hella fun. Yes mages can AoE grind, but that's not really my style *(will be hard to accomplish on a fresh server, anyway)*. 
---
Then again I've played frost mage PvP at a naughty instant 60 server and it felt great. Slowing down and freezing melee attackers. *Feels damn good.* Making food and drinks and having Polymorph is such great utility... But being a vendormachine sucks. People ***will*** whisper you constantly for drinks. Teleporting is amazing, given the great travel distances in Classic. 
---
I feel you, man! I like [uaMarshall](https://www.reddit.com/user/uaMarshall) 's comment as well. You can always reroll. There's plenty of time, don't sweat it. 
---
**Only ''advice'' I can give you: flip a coin.** While it's in the air, you might catch yourself wishing it was warlock. Or mage. 
---
Just wait a little. They might have some good news before launch.
---
With a lot of pserver warriors tanking some raid bosses as fury these days for the threat generation, I think the age old argument against Druid tanks needs to be looked at again
---
You get 50% of the XP, but you also double the DPS. As long as there are monsters to kill multiboxing is not that big of a penalty, might even be a boon. Only when you are actually killing mobs faster than they respawn, you start to see the negative effects.
---
I don't have a subscription, I can't. Please, anyone, feel free to repost it there in any way you want.

I've tried using starter packs, leveling characters to lvl 10, contacting Blizzard support, they keep saying that "posting on the forums is a ""privilege"" (I quote) of active subscribers."

Because early on during retail Vanilla, RPPvP servers were released to great fanfare, starting the distinction between RPPvP and RPPvP.
---
Yeah, if you actually use a flask for that thats 60-120g depending on flask usage on a server and what flask you use. Increasing time farming by an hour to finish the raid an hour earlier is not exactly economical as you also should enjoy doing stuff with your guildies and not treat rushing MC as a loot pinata.
---
In all semi hardcore guilds I've been (pserver mind you), the tank used a flask of titans to smooth the edges and the rest used some FAP on golemagg, a arcane prot pot on shazzrah, a fire prot pot or two on ragnaros and depending on decurser attendance a resto pot if needed. All that combind is like 20-30g and not 100g for a flask the alone.
---
Me all I want to know is who is this Threshold guy that is out-dpsing everybody :D
---
&gt;Also people will deliberately camp quest NPCs like Gerrick Paddfoot in the start zones just to ruin players experience.
---
You act as if that shit didn't happen back then anyways.  I very much remember alliance raid the barrens back in TBC and killing all the quest givers.
---
&gt; I can see it now. Trade chat filled with trolls talking shit about how boring the game is and how we should feel bad for liking it. 
---
Is this something that doesnt happen?  every other week since WoW has existed someone has made some form of comment about how its dying/bad
---
A sad situation. What happens if/when an RPPvP server is released? Will you reroll after months of time investment into your character?
---
Something like this is like killing the community before even giving it a chance to form.
---
Druids have an extremely high skill ceiling in PvP. Not just in arbitrary wPvP but also as flag carrier in BGs. A very skilled druid flag carrier can outrun many people at a time and buy precious time for your team.
---
Might not be among your aspirations to become a PvP god, but there is always the option to get there as a druid.
---
Magmadar fear can be dispelled, but iirc onyxia/nef/gluth/yauj fears can not. 
---
Oh I'm just going off of Naxx raid numbers. Basically you've got a good mix between fury warriors, Fire Mages, and Rogues taking up the top spots, with warlocks shortly behind them, and then a pretty sizeable gap to hunter(s). 
---
Like check out these 2 raids that I randomly pulled:
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=30635&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=48195
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=30662&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=48251
---
I'd say these are pretty representative of the damage numbers you see for a full (or nearly full) Naxx run.  I'm not left with the impression that only fury warrior should be nerfed after looking at those.
---
I might continue raidlogging on a tbc or wrath server but yes pretty much 100% classic.
---
If you plan to play multiple specs, you will need to respec a lot. You will go through a lot of gold. Not a major drawback, but with gold being much harder to get in classic, it might cause some pain. 
---
I’ve heard Lock is very gear dependent never played one but that kinda scared me away from the class.. they said without a lot of steam you just get blown up.
---
Which two-hand?

That's a complete bullshit argument. Then why don't they release with login queues? Why not lag? Why not no 1.12 items? Why not 1.0 talent builds? Why not no pet swimming animations?
---
A completely bullshit and disingenuous argument. Classic is releasing as **1.12, the definitive Vanilla experience.**
---
There were RPPvP servers at patch 1.12.
---
For me it is important. It makes the damage more fun, it's more engaging text and generally adds to the whole gameplay and feel. That's what classic is all about after all. Being able to play the old game again and for it to really feel like vanilla.
---
Agreed, but remember that most locks will wear Bloodline pieces until when and if they get deeper into AQ and certainly Naxx. 
---
I agree with you. I find myself doing the same kind of sifting, but I do it nevertheless - you know, just in case.  
---
I'm not trying to defend anything, but I think he keeps it basic in his vids to cater to the people who maybe haven't played a class extensively, or possibly not even played vanilla at all.
---
My very first characters had stupid names. The later one‘s were okay but I want to start over with a „new identity“. 
---
Blizzard can open new servers when ever they like. But most likely wont do any until release has been in NAXX for a while. Then they can do 3 different things. Release fresh classics, leave some classic servers as "forver naxx" and have option to do TBC expansion.
---
&gt; I think there's going to be a strong casual presence in Vanilla
---
you will see mostly semihardcore where u raid like 10 hour a week and only need elixirs and foodbuffs manapots gffp thats it
---
no flasks ( for most anyway) no worldbuff ( except zg cuz it stay after wipes) and juju etc
---
Fair enough. (:
---
I just think that, if it's possible to perhaps 'tweek' all of the new customization options that came after Vanilla so that they are on par with the graphics of the original options, that it simply helps the player get that much closer to creating a character they're visually satisfied with.
---
Of course, I'm sure there are quite a lot of people who literally couldn't care less. Hopefully a majority of those people can adopt an attitude similar to: "As long as it looks like Vanilla graphics!". \^\^
---
Mage tier sets specifically are not my favorite, but apart from a couple bright neon robes and shirts instead of robes, most high level cloth gear looks cool. Here's the tier sets:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Armor_set#/media/File:Tiers_1-2-3.png
---
tl;dr This idea: lets go back to the stone age of raiding and pretend that it's fun. Spoiler: It may be fun for a couple of times, but will get old quickly. If you seek a way to have fun ~~torture yourself~~ there are much better ideas like druid-only raid etc. 
---
Btw you get ~80g through boss gold drops if you clear Ony + ZG + BWL, that's more than enough to fund your next runs unless you're flasking. 
---
An hour spent that requires 40 people focused at the same time is in no way comparable to an hour spent on your own. In fact since you cannot replicate the 40 manhours by doing 40 1 man-hours, it's even more expensive than 40x.
---
So be a tank, be able to solo DM, or be in a 5man?  The rest of those require some measure of luck (rare patterns/AH) or don't give 20g/hr outside of devilsaur/black lotus.
---
Just have to use Trump spelling on the name.
---
It's really fucking annoying when retards think it's a non-issue. The way numbers appear in the game affects how you experience the game. If all numbers were just the small, inconsequential ones and they were all the same font size and came out the exact same way, you're telling me most people would experience the game the same way if the numbers popped like they did in Vanilla? Get the fuck out of here dumbass.
---
Having to reroll would be a very ugly thing. Just release one RPPvP server at launch, damnit. It's so clear as day it's incredible they won't do it.
---
But they've backed down on stupider mistakes before, like 4 content stages. They've been humble and open minded. Hopefully they see this too.
---
Lupus won't be any better in classic than other wolves
---
Skinning/some gathering at lvl 1 and near 60 is when you switch professions using stashed mats and gold. You will quickly be wool starved on tailoring while enchanting will be way behind. 
---
Great stuff. I've been looking for some material on mid-game warrior tanking - difficulties somewhere between UBRS and MC. This gives me some hours of ressearch to go through. Thanks.
---
I meant not all of them will be able to pay for the classic sub and these people will remain on pservers. I imagine this number is slightly higher than EU/NA solely comparing the economies. 
---
For example the russian GDP per capita is still below 1000$.
---
Tought I heart something about that. Will never complete the quest and always keep that in my bag.
---
For in dungeons when people are slow.
---
nope.
---
Going into Classic for the challenge and removing the challenge by cheesing the game by stacking piles upon piles of buffs seems contradictory.
---
wtf? Really?
---
I'm quite certain a majority won't even realise it's not the same text. And it's something you easily can fix your self if it's so annoying for you.
---
Too bad you can't play though, since the launcher doesn't look the same. So you can't even start the game =(
---
Yes, it's called herbalism or mining.
---
As a Horde I would love this. 
---
I can guaranty you there won't be any AE farming on fresh servers. Even if you're  in the top rushers there will be people on your spots.
---
im late to the party and gotta say im devestated by this! never played vanilla wow before just read a lot about it and about back in the day and 100% wanted to and was going to roll on a rppvp server like back in the day!!! so sad about this cant even express it.
---
yep!
---
Heirlooms and dungeon finder weren’t a bad idea at the time.  Dungeon finder filled a need for a global meet-up application that wasn’t “sit in town and spam chat”.  Heirlooms covered a need to NOT have to wait days of played time to get someone up to max level so you could start gearing them so they could get in to raids.  
---
The problem is the barrier of entry went from way to high to way too low.  Rather than just meeting people who also wanted to run a dungeon, dungeon finder became a prisoners dilemma of douchebags seeing who could outdo the other because the biggest jerk got everything they needed on and no time to be social because you were never going to see those people again, coupled with no coordination being necessary.  
---
Conversely, heirlooms ruined leveling because doing so without them was just slower, and made any rewards you got along the way totally unsatisfying because you weren’t going to replace that weapon/armor that stayed BIS from 1 to almost cap. 
---
All classes can do strat:live in a 5men guild group with a treasurer who sells the high selling items and shares by 5.
---
Yes, it is. You can do strat live with starter gear with people you 100% trust in 17-20minutes per run.
---
You can also bite the bullet and speedlevel a hunter in 5 days /played and barrel roll through maraudon or AoE farm DM:E + N as mage. For both you don't need gear and depending if you can sell some blackstone rings you can make even more than 60g/hour.
---
Casters are less gear dependent in general than physical damage users. Warriors are a good example of this, Rogues/Hunters have a load of utility which helps them hide it - but they're still INCREDIBLY reliant on weapons.
---
A pvp-specced Warlock in 60 blues, or even level 60 pvp gear which you do not need to raid for, will fuck almost anything up 1v1.
---
So wait wait wait. 
---
Are you telling me the way WoW works you take a Raptor, a Boat, and a Bear, then you master the Raptor skill and can get rid of him, equip hear, then teach the hear the raptor skill?
---
What you said sounds like if the Pikachu l caught taught me Thunderbolt then I the trainer taught Thunderbolt to a Ratatat
---
I have never ever ever heard of this
---
*shrug*
---
I didnt start playing until Wrath (were quivers even a thing at that point?  I dont really remember them) and have never played on a private server.  I guess its just not something i would have really thought about.  If i hear 'quiver' i would think its a hunter only thing, or at least only for classes that can equip bows (and i guess maybe guns?  Or ammo bags for them?)
---
100% a raptor. Hopefully they still have the old pet code so elites/rares have better stats than average mobs..if so, wc raptor and hopefully 1 random rare and 1 for leveling the skills of those pets.
---
I would love to get more hairstyles and orcs post chiropractic correction, but it’s not going to happen until at least the end of Classic’s lifecycle when #nochanges dies down and people start looking for something new.
---
classic raiding is not a challenge.
---
Add launch wave which will make leveling and grouping faster.
---
So you plan to have one of the best gold farmer in the game as your main and you want an alt to gold farm ?
---
Fwiw back in vanilla on my server the Chinese farmers all had hunters then switched to rogues (probably solo instance farming).
---
Rogue / Mage multi boxing is the most unnatural combo you could ever imagine.
---
If I was you, I would just farm with the rogue and if I really wanted to multi box I would use a druid as the second char : way more synergies between these 2 and imagine all the possibilities at endgame like instance farming specific bosses.
---
&gt; also i think second druid hots overwrite other druids hot on the same target.
---
It's even worse If I remember correctly. The second HOT will only overwrite if it heals for more. If it heals for less or the same, you will get "A more powerful spell is already active on the target", wasting your cast.
---
You can run with a 30/21 spec, and be fine do anything you want non raid.   You won't have the big burst like a warrior or rogue tho.   So grinding elites takes a little longer, but you have other tools.
---
Compared to BC onwards, feral rotation in raid dps can compete, but you need to put in the extra effort grinding for gear.   As DPS you pretty much have to power shift, shred until 4 and bite.  Main challenge is to watch your mana, it sucks being stuck in caster.  You'll have to go 32 points deep though as lotp is desired.
---
As resto, for 5 man's you'll face stigma over not having a non cd Rez, but if you have a hybrid DPS buddy, problem solved.  In raids, you'll likely end up spamming different ranks of healing touch, occasionally throwing out rejuvenation, but you have to plan ahead as only one rejuvenation is allowed on a character, if your is weaker you are wasting that time.  Depending on the content, the innervate is never meant for you.
---
That said, the class is definitely capable of doing great heals, but it's definitely more work.
---
In terms of performance, you can definitely keep up, but will have to invest time in mastering all your utility, and if you play exceptionally well, you'll beat mediocre, under geared people, but you'll likely lag behind the more skilled players if other classes.
---
Idk. Crossrealm bg effectively kills scouting. Would make battlegrounds much more fair in the 60 bracket. 
---
There are guilds forming left and right.
---
Look at the sticky for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b58g7e/looking_for_group_monday_march_25_2019/
---
Hopefully. They said they would be gauging interest and I think the community has been pretty clear.
---
Ah, it was changed before 1.12. My fault sorry. 
---
I guess I wasn't fully accurate to say it never happens. But it's one of those things that only seems cool until it happens to you and you realise that having some level 12 say nice gear and then follow you around spamming you with invites isn't very cool at all. 
---
They had better not wipe servers. That d feats the while charm of WoW. 
---
I would pay $15.00-$30.00 a month for life to ensure my lovely rogue stays the same as I left him. 
---
It's like owning a musket or an old house
---
 There's value that cannot be replaced because having the char helps me remember my life.
---
Yeah, but not all pet families can learn all skills. Charge for example is a Boar only skill, so if you have a favorite low level boar, you'll have to learn Charge 2-3-4 from other boars and teach it to him.
---
Most cat's don't know Claw skill, but you can teach it claw from another pet.
---
Get add-ons bompow fixed let the Devs spend time on important stuff instead of shit like this :)
---
Polarbear, a wolf, and some kind of cat. Pure roleplaying  for me
---
And ironically caster worldbuffs are meh compared to melee.
---
10% flat crit, 25 stats, a metric fuck ton of AP, 15% stats, 10% damage, oh and 15% atkspeed which is about 10% damage.
---
I did vanilla from the beginning to the end, and I feel lucky for having been able to do so.  
---
I agree with you in the advice you're giving, that people who didn't get to play vanilla should do so without any knowledge aquairred beforehand. However, this won't give them the same vanilla experience that I assume both you and I had.
---
And besides, I don't think the new generation of gamers has the same mentality, as the gamers from back in the vanilla days.
---
I hated boar charge sooooooooo much as warrior. Finally in range to intercept? Boar comes running at you at mach 1. &gt;:(
---
Yeah thats my problem with the game right now too. The gameplay is AWFUL. There is a lot of cool and pretty stuff, and it is the World of Warcraft still.. but the classes are in shambles. They all just play terribly. 
---
&gt;On horde, warriors get WF, dont think bears gain anything from it. Making Warriors much closer so druid threat just based on that extra buff. So on alliance you have buffs to increase your threat and lower others. On horde you got buffs that give warrior more threat, but not for the bear.
---
For a female character yes. For male I'd rather go tauren everytime.
---
Upright Orc posture, please... its the only thing I want
---
I think that if I would go to hell, I would be made to watch a Asmongold reaction to something while a demon would periodically whisper in my left hear "Hello it's Tip".
---
lmao you think people could afford a sub 15 years ago but cant now? 
---
Any other Japanese players hoping for a few Oceanic servers :).?
---
The comments are exactly the cesspool I expected to see.  There are some real pathetic fucks on this planet.  So much negativity without a single justification.
---
Roleplayers, the second class citizens of a roleplaying game.
---
I could live with that.  They just look so much better that way.  
---
&gt; Also, if you don't like walking around with the same equipment for 60 levels - then don't. You do not have to use heirlooms. Go on then - level without them if they ruins your experience, nobody will stop you.
---
What heirlooms take away is the fun of finding an upgrade that's a real upgrade over the current item.
---
Sure, you can choose to just not use heirlooms, but if you don't, you're just gimping yourself. How much fun is that upgrade under in that situation? All you're going to think is "that blue item is still worse than an heirloom".
---
It is a strange idea, comparable to saying "no cookie cutter specs" or "no enchants" - most people would simply see that as arbitrary and non-sensical. None of those would be necessary either, on the hypothetical 40 man raiding team that is otherwise good players but chose to play under arbitrary handicap.
---
The accrue rested XP trick only applies to characters of a certain level to be worth it. There’s no reason to accrue rested on a character below level 15, as it takes so long and the levels go by so quickly.
---
I get what you’re saying, but we don’t know which values are off and which aren’t. Hence, it’s a bit pointless to discuss this.
---
Well done 
---
Taming Takk the Leaper was so baller back in the day.  He had like 4x movement speed.
---
Why would you think people playing pservers automatically were playing 15years ago? Maybe a certain amount of people play pservers, because it's free, therefore won't migrate to the real deal later?
---
Ench for d/e ain't bad til 60; might still be able to make more money with skinning though; even if you just vendor the leather. I think it's worth a shot.
---
I logged in during free weekend and killed Geddon one last time... and finally completed my Thundefury after having right binding + 10x elementium bars + quest item in my bags for like 15 years. Put my end-of-vanilla gear on and went to the fresh NE spawn point on Teldrassil, where it all started 5231 days prior, and logged out for the last time.
---
Wen's classic? :p
---
Roadmap for PvP. There are a lot of unanswered questions and I'm very interested in hearing from Blizzard about this because some of the decisions that need to be made are pretty big and have a significant impact on the game.
---
Honestly. As someone that played on an Rppvp realm in Vanilla, I can see why blizz is doing this. 
---
They never really caught on. Despite merging most of them, the ones still around in retail are dead.
---
So, if I had to guess, they’re looking at overall population trends, going back to Vanilla, to make this call.
---
I like owls from Teldrassil since they can learn screech. Screech lets you use multi-shot on multiple targets without drawing aggro away from your pet.
---
The way I see it (and I will try to explain it), Vanilla was the most balanced iteration of WoW. Now, what I understand by balance goes beyond class balance. As it should be. You can't just compare classes and specs exclusively through a single component. You have to take EVERYTHING into consideration.
---
Vanilla, as a game, had multiple components, all of them being almost equally IMPORTANT. For example, leveling in Vanilla was an important part of the game. 5 men dungeons were an important part of the game. PvP was an important part of the game. raiding was an important part of the game. Farming was an important part of the game.
---
Look at Retail, starting from WoD, continuing with Legion and ending with BfA. Leveling is not an important part of the game. farming is not an important part of the game. 5 men dungeons are not an important part of the game. And even raiding is not an important part of the game in Retail. So...what is important in Retail? Daily quests, world quests, WF and IE. These components are taking up the MOST of the play time of a Retail player. Raiding is, for **most** Retail players, a SIDE activity. As it is 5 men dungeons. Or farming. Or leveling. Or PvP. Those are SIDE activities to dailies, WQs, WF and IE.
---
A player in Vanilla would spend almost equal portions of time between raiding, running dungeons, farming, PvP, with a big chunk  of time for the initial leveling process, or leveling alts.
---
Vanilla, as whole game, was balanced in ALL ASPECTS. Yes, a Boomkin would not be the first choice for raiding...but it would be a damn good choice for PvP. A Hunter would not be the first choice for raiding...but for PvP and leveling would be a solid choice. Shadow Priests...not the first choice for raids. But for PvP...damn good of a choice.
---
In other words, in Vanilla, a class or spec would absolutely SUCK BALLS at PvE, but would do great in PvP. A class or a spec in Vanilla would SUCK BALLS at farming...but it would be great for PvE. A class or a spec in Vanilla would absolutely suck at leveling, but it would be great for raiding. And so on. And so on.
---
There isn't a SINGLE CLASS in Vanilla that would not have a downside, be it PvE, PvP, leveling, farming or raiding. There is a single case that could be made against this : Mages.
---
Mages are good at...everything. But, they still have a downside, and a big one : raid spots. For their AoE farming power, their leveling speed or PvP,  they will suffer for raid spot. There were a gazillion of players playing Mages in Vanilla, and there will be a gazillion playing it in Classic. But a good part of them were simply benched for raids...because there were TOO MANY OF THEM.
---
The way I see it, and comparing with anything after Vanilla, the balance, AS A WHOLE, was much better in Vanilla. TBC, while on paper, "fixed" some specs, with the removal of 40 men raids and the added Arena and PvP gear (resilience crap especially), they actually screwed up the balance of TBC , as a WHOLE.
---
Even today, after 15 years of WoW, after WATERING DOWN important parts of the game (leveling, farming, raiding, 5 men dungeons) the so-called class balance in BfA is stupidly unbalanced.
---
Vanila was the most balanced WoW, because all the imbalances in the game, when put together...WORKED almost perfectly.
---
I'm down, bring the pain.
---
When raids weren't full of world buff + flask :)
---
I would say literally everything in vanilla is a grind. Leveling the entchantment skill, forging any weapon even below 60 etc. But the difference (for me at least) is, if you managed to forge your weapon, get exhalted or even finish a quest alone (which was sometimes hard) gave you so much satisfatcion!  
---
So i look forward to hardgrind green/blue items to get maybe 1 skillpoint in entchantments :D
---
Yes but not anything before 1.12. Most of vanilla it wasn't there.
---
&gt; WoW Classic Class Picking Guide
---
Ya if you are completely new to the game, don't pick a class just because it is good at PVP or PVE. Lol, I didn't even know about those two things when I was creating my first character. I didn't know anything at all except what was provided in the character creation screen. All in all, I ended up picking a Druid because of the shapeshifting.
---
Not necessarily, but I think multiplayer games have lost a lot of the social aspect due to matchmaking (and LFG). You never see the same people and make friends. Everyone's in their own little bubble. 
---
The other thing that was different 15 years ago is that major AAA developers were willing/able to take risks. Companies like Blizzard are now followers, when they used to be leaders. All the innovation now comes from the indie scene, but they don't have the budgets to be super ambitious.
---
But you would level faster, farm better and PvP better than a Prot Warrior.
---
So, for one downside, you get an upside (or more).
---
duo jump runs in DME? not sure if they will be a thing again
---
need epic mount for efficiency. Paladin has an easier time getting his tho.
---
Good bot
---
I agree completely.
---
I'm considering a career in Taloring/Enchanting. I know it's a recipe to be poor and overworked, but I'll still do it, dammit!
---
I must say though,.... since I have watch some class picking things on youtube, it is probably worth noting that a couple classes will primarily be healers during end-game. 
---
Take Legolas on a warrior and just argue that "I have a bow!" when people whine about it.
---
Why would they be? What reason? 
---
It is not something current add-ons can reproduce. Trust me, both Asmon and I have brought it up several time on his stream, to tens of thousands of people, to try and see if it can be replicated, but it can't. You just don't know what you're talking about.
---
Do you usually try to include yourself in others marriages?
---
lolbro hasnt been live for years
---
also -- you can still wear truefaith if you drop tailor. no issues there.
---
only when its creepy and weird🙃
---
Nothing yet, but given that they have infrastructure online for wow in oceanic and the client is modern id expect them to deploy at least 1 
---
Don't forget that screech also makes owls incredibly tanky and they have the best stat combination of any pet that can use it. If it weren't for boars' charge being so good in pvp servers then there'd be almost no question of it being the best leveling pet in all circumstances.
---
Dire Maul will not be available at launch
---
Horde is fine so long as your shaman twists totems, doesn't the totem give you like 90 agi?   It's been 13 years or so, but I don't think I ever had 800 ago to make kings comparable.
---
I could be totally wrong tho.   
---
Come join us!
---
You must have a very easy life if this is a concern you feel you reaaaally need to spend time on. And I pray to gods Blizzard won't start listening to streamers complaining about little shit stuff.
---
Classic Waiting Room. 
---
There's a zero percent chance they will wipe normal servers. One thing they could do is create rolling season servers that exist for a fixed period of time. They do something similar in Diablo 2. But those would be completely separate from the core game and definitely not be something that exists on launch.
---
&gt; No because to effectively farm you will need to invest money into your famrer character so they can farm effectively / efficiently.
---
mages do it in greens
---
Rogues and warriors tearing shit up
---
in a nutshell
---
Pure undocumented speculation. We can hope for news
---
I love the idea of seasons (I rerolled on new realms all the time in retail, and fresh private servers are always hot), but it'd have to be it's own server type and have the option to copy your characters over to an existing realm at the end of the season.
---
I think ultimately I'd prefer progressing to TBC though.
---
they will just not for a few months
---
Have they ever talked openly about realm populations though?
---
"You ain't got no life, you ain't got no friends, and you know you wanna spend your weekend with 40 people you don't know."
---
"Hey, sounds like me. Where do I subscribe?"
---
"On the web-site."
---
Cat. Hunter BM leveling is. So easy, I can manage 2 mobs no problem with a cat, not sure why anyone would have problems just have your pet alternate then focus one down. Owl is OK I guess but less damage, I just don’t use one because the wing flapping gets really annoying. 
---
So cat, pick up claw tanks here and there and just plow through to 60 and start farming and leveling professions.
---
A friend of mine got told Troll male was the coolest thing to roll when he started playing in vanilla by another friend. He was pretty annoyed by it when he was lvl 45-50 and realized that we was pranked. I think he played Troll male Rogue until tbc and never liked it.
---

Woah man, bringin way too much heat
---
I'm on your side, I think the Vanilla crit displays were infinitely cooler than what we have now, since now we always feel like wet noodles
---
But holy smokes man, this one can almost certainly be fixed with an addon if blizz doesn't get it right so... it just.. doesn't seem so srs...
---
Right click report removal, no cross faction collusion via battlenet, pre-1.8 AV, progressive itemization, no sharding, realm pop &amp; server list, release date, firm commitments from Blizzard about the future of the project.
---
Like, I kinda get what he's saying, but let's just take a look at an alternate example:
---
&gt;Server has 100 players.
---
&gt;20 players are regularly engaged in RP.
---
&gt;RP players want the RP server to be just for RP players.
---
&gt;Server has 20 players.
---
I don't see how segregating the communities is good for anyone. People can RP on ANY server. Private channels have been a thing since launch, so I just don't get why they'd not just use one on a populated server so that they could still participate in other game elements with different-minded players.
---
Biggest reason to not play a druid in Vanilla : No mangle.
---
Mangle is what made suffering throughout vanilla as a druid worth it in TBC.
---
I'm picking a different class this time around.
---
First, a reconfirmation of sharding at launch only, only to shut up all the private server player that are "hanging" on the assumption that sharding will be permanent, because it fits their agenda of attacking Classic and Blizzard.
---
Secondly, if the realm population will be similar (or very close) to Vanilla realms (10,000 total players, 2,500 concurrent players)
---
Thirdly, a clarification on right-click reporting.
---
Are you sure about that? I seem to remember having addons even in vanilla that dramatically changed how the combat text was displayed, so I'm having trouble believing it would be impossible to recreate with an addon
---
Yeah it really sucked watching everyone else starting to look really cool but your stuck with your tusks.. and awful helmet skins... and lanky body... Still love me some trolls though. Will definitely roll troll once classic rolls around.
---
I got a little bit lucky on a recent private server launch and stayed ahead of the curve the entire way up to 60. Was super happy about my choice to use an owl because it paid off massively.
---
If I hadn't gotten ahead I would 100% have used a boar though because they're just too good for PvP/leveling.
---
True but with gold from leveling and prebis dungeon farming those 800g(well 900 if no pvp system early) comes quite fast. Other classes has a hard time because they need to buy gear, you don't need to as a healer early on, as a tank you do but you will prolly get help from guild.
---
There was a trick you could do in the old vanilla/TBC mailbox system where you could apply a soul binding enchant to a piece of gear and hit send at the same time.
---
With this method, I had a lvl 29 troll rogue with ZG shoulders and helm, and the level 350 leatherworking enchant on my chest and legs.
---
Shit was OP as Hell.  Loved that twink.  Played it more than my main in TBC.
---
Yea, a lot of people sound like they think they can LFR and get the same 40 people every time at any time of day. Otherwise their arguments just don't make sense.
---
Yup. Even today in the US, Ragnaros is the dedicated brazilian / south american server - you will literally never encounter a Ragnaros player whose primary language isn't spanish. 
---
Horde druids have less absolute and relative power.
---
They don't benefit as much from totems as they do from paladin buffs. Being a feral, you'll likely be in a melee group, so you'll have WF totem doing nothing for you, instead of agi totem.
---
Warriors have more overall threat with WF, making bear druids worse in comparison.
---
*he's playing everyquest*
---
*damn...*
---
Always gets me
---
Worth it for the perfect condition game guide!
---
Activision and Blizzard are two separate companies who happen to be owned by the same parent company.
---
I won't have much time playing Classic (job, wife, child). So it will take years for me to lvl my lock and mage to 60 and gear up.
---
That is why I hope the game will not be changed for a long time.
---
On the other hand I hope the servers won't be empty after a couple of years. 
---
since you want to tank dungeons and heal during raids it is a option to pick a paladin, with one build you can do both healing and tanking. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo)
---
But I think you are a horde player so a paladin is not a option?
---
I recently switched to an owl for the first time. The flapping and it taking up so much vertical space is highly annoying though. Even in rest mode... If I stand at the mailbox, you see those wings flap in front of your face all the time. A cat is just yawning.
---
anyway we dont know if the gold values will be good enough
---
same for lashers
---
While I don't disagree with you, this arguments is pretty damn sketchy to me. It can be applied to so much that most of us probably don't want. 
---
Honest question: what's to stop you from RPing on a normal server?
---
I would never play knowing a server wipe was waiting for my toons 3 years down the road.
---
Setting up a teleport to an island is trivial and has been done before. There was a quest in Blade's Edge Mountain that did that on the way to 70.
---
Cool that you thought of one thing I overlooked.
---
Was this Ascent from Medivh?
---
Folks should just think of it as a replica, not a refurbished version.
---
We're buying into a *replica* of vanilla.
---
We're not going to be playing vanilla.
---
Hell, it's being built on the Legion infrastructure. 
---
I dont know...
---
If they stick with the same timeline of releasing phases like an expansion, we'll have 2 years of content. I dont know about you but in the time between MC -&gt; BWL there's going to be a lot of raids where you dont NEED consumables and youll be able to stock pile mats / gold and consumables. 
---
I don't think consumables will be as big of deal as people think during the lifespan of these servers. Especially if blizzard puts tokens in a store later on or something. 
---
Yep ;)
---
Yeah what I’m saying is that should remain in retail and they can all be pessimistic trolls with a separate sub. Classic would be better off with a separate paid subscription. Also it would greatly reduce the clutter and possible need for sharding upon launch.  It’s a win/win keeping them separate. 
---
For Lore I picked up the World of Warcraft Chronicle 1-3, its been a fantastic read, and pretty amazing artwork.  Read one a month and you'll be set.
---
Disagree with everyone saying Mage, the +hit does wonders early on so probably a Hunter since the bow is so easy to obtain.
---
Well to be fair you can't use Loatheb as an example for this. Loatheb is like the only fight in vanilla where protection pots are actually mandatory and you legit can't do the fight without them, even back in the day people used them to kill him. But C'thun? Thaddius? My guild didn't use any proection potions for these bosses, some people used NR pots on the dance boss in naxx because they were lagging but other than that... i think we used fire prot pots on Ragnaros first kill and then Loatheb. People on private servers(where i play now) somehow think you need protection pots for every single boss that has an AOE. And to me this is just sad, yes all the consumes helps a shit ton to kill the boss, but they make most encounters trivial and it's almost cheating because of how much easier things become. People didn't use that many consumables in vanilla so the encounters aren't balanced around a raid with 15+ consumables running per raid member.
---
Nice try, Threshold.
---
If i remember correctly the decline started already near the end of wotlk. 
---
I didn't have that many friends when I was younger. Once you get older, you meet more people through work, connections and friends.
---
That's your opinion, sure, but how many guilds actually cleared Naxx? 
---
&gt; What? I don't know or care.
---
I think it's odd that you choose to define pvp "combat" in such a way as to exclude the skill MOST influential in pvp. The rogue and druid have an entire suite of attacks that require them to be stealthed to use them. By your definition, those attacks that do actual damage to other players are not combat attacks.
---
But hey, you do you.
---
If it's a deal breaker for you thats fine, but the community seems pretty split on it.
---
I'm 100% in the wants it camp. I played Vanilla without it, the recodnising of a name was, for me, not worth the 2 hour waits (and my server was balanced mid to high pop). 
---
Because I'm not subbed to him
---
No, no, no, that's "threshold" in the meaning of "benchmark", and everyone is underperforming...
---
Sure I'll take your word for it, but past 15 it'll still be efficient, yes?
---
And then you replace them.  
---
It's basically how casual guilds works. But you're right, you can attract competitive player with the &lt;Whatever you want&gt; guild., so probably no Naxx for me :D  
---
40 Druid Raids will be a thing!  I demand it!
---
I will be going resto shaman w/ my warrior friend, are than any other finer details for the DM:E runs? Never played during vanilla just curious what exact parts of the dungeon are ran
---
You didn't have to sit in town and spam chat...
---
People seem to forget the /who function. If you just searched for *"Warrior 30-40"* you found dozens of people. *"Hey you wanna tank SM?"*. And there was always somebody up for a run. You could get a group in &lt;5 min.
---
And then u were grouped with people on your sever who you would run into occasionally when leveling. And perhaps even become friends in time.
---
And regarding Herilooms. The game should not be about end game only. If people don't care for leveling then perhaps an MMO is not the right type of game for those people.
---
I plan on doing the same thing, but with more than one alt.  By the time my Warrior hits 60, I'll probably also have like a level 30 Hunter, a 20 Warlock and a several other classes at least up to ~10.
---
Why do you make me google it for you?
---
http://i.imgur.com/VfgDPSu.png
---
Thanks. I just hope Barrens chat won't be filled with Kappa, Pogs, 4head, etc.
---
#I'm ugly and I'm proud!
---
Tell that to vanilla private servers 15 years later.
---
Definitely. I always level 2 characters simultaneously. I recommend grinding your main to 10-15 first day. Then do the same for your Alt the next day. Then they will both be in a good range to start making use of rested XP.
---
It’s not a video...
---
&gt; But the reality is that no one truly remembers how vanilla was so it's easy to see p servers as being close, but they're so far off.
---
As you've said, noone has these things down exactly as they were.  There's a reason people play the private servers, and that's because they are very similar to the game as it was in vanilla.  You're degrading these videos as if they are complete falsehoods when that's not the fact.  They are using the knowledge they have via private servers or memories from vanilla and many of these things will have a fairly decent degree of accuracy.  With the alternative being no guides/content at all (because noone has full knowledge on the subject), it seems silly to degrade these guides.
---
I remember there was an all Druid guild on my server. They used to do 5 mans and I vaguely remember seeing a video of them doing Dire Maul. 
---
I doubt they actually had 40 druids to raid with. 
---
Completely forgot to throw the link, sorry.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/-8par3WimiU) is the video.
---
That's a great idea actually. I'll steal that one. Gotta have a hunter to sustain my warrior's low income.
---
One that i know of was 40 priests doing Onyxia. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0)
---
No I don't think so. At least nobody brought up this topic in Discord. Just PvP it is then.
---
if it was possible we would have it by now.
---
Well, the main reason would be simply because the content already exists. Also, who doesn't want more character customization options? :o
---
I'm a programmer and not a technical artist, so I'm not an expert. With that being said, I'm assuming that taking all of the extra options that were created after Vanilla and... reducing the amount of polygons? Perhaps? Would be a sufficient approach to keeping them inline with original Vanilla character options.  
---
TL;DR - Given that the content already exists; if it's a simple fix then I think people will appreciate it.
---
Honestly. FoV.
---
The camera angle in the classic demo was wrong and gave me headaches like live does sometimes. It's why you felt like you were running faster.
---
Id also like the chat anti-spam system gone. Nothing worse than being told you can't type/keep being part of a conversation because you "typed to much recently". Introduced for cross realm stuff, it has no place in classic.
---
Id also like to see the right click report gone, and just replaced with a mute option.
---
THIS is why I'd love a beta.
---
After the personal ones tho, realm types and population details.
---
It's kinda like when Tyrion asked Daenerys about her succession to the crown.
---
"We'll talk about my succession when I wear the crown." Fits quite well in this scenario. Let's see after Phase 6.
---
You mean the Private servers that Reset progress every so often, people migrate to new servers that are opening so they can be part of the progress, and the most populated ones have 5k people? 
---
He's only hosting the deep dive. Wtf are you going on about?
---
Got Side Tracked looking up T0.5 guides, my bad
---
Where the hell is our glorious leader Zug?
---
Pointless, t.05 is coming out too late to matter because there will be much better gear available for less work/effort. Because of how expensive it is and the amount of effort you need to put forth to complete it, it's totally not worth. 
---
I feel sorry for the people who will start later and will be forced to pay for some of this gear in an effort to get their pre-raid bis.

Id legit be in for this. Im going to be looking for a casual guild just to avoid this issue if not. 
---
Is there any place where we can find more info on this? If not, DM me as well when it's out.
---
The melodrama in your first sentence is palpable... I agree with your sentiment, though.  Part of what makes vanilla great is the journey and exploration so taking everything in without following step-by-step guides would definitely be beneficial for a new (or even old) players experience. 
---
but then you would lose people.  I play Retail because I like the Raiding, but i want to play classic because i enjoy the character building and adventure it holds even if the raiding is gonna be lackluster compared to today.  If i had to pay a separate sub for both? no thanks.

you are asking for blizz to charge more money when literally all you have to do is mute someone.

Clan Knightmare is Recruiting for Classic Wow
---
Our website if interested: [clankm.net](https://clankm.net)
---
Server: NA - East or Central - PVP
---
Faction: Alliance
---
Raid Times: Will be chosen upon release
---
Our Focus: Complete all endgame raids &amp; Dominate in PvP
---
We currently have 30 dedicated players
---
Tanks: 3 (Need only a few more)
---
Healers: 4 (Need only a few more)
---
DPS: 23 (Looking for 40 more dps for part-time slots &amp; full time)
---
Please pm me if you have any questions.
---
Druids post-rework are great tanks and since Classic is based on 1.12 you have nothing to worry about there.
---
When it comes to farming leathers Druids are great since they don't have any downtime. Run around and kill stuff, pop out of form to HoT yourself, pop back into form and be on your way.
---
I never got the mentality.
---
"Lets do 3 hours of boring shit, so that the fun shit lasts under an hour"
---
Why not do 'fuck all' boring shit, and have fun all night instead?
---
Hey OP great post. +1. Im sorry people are arguing and being assholes in the comments. 
---
At first I thought you said "so we can start coordinating where to troll already."
---
I need an energy drink.
---
Get 4 IRL friends....thats my goal
---
BAM
---
SHOT A FIREBALL IN HIS FACE 
---
WOW thanks!
---
We can always hope! :D Like I wrote in another comment, I think most people will really appreciate the extra character customization options.
---
I'm all for #NoChanges in most areas, especially actual game content. However, when it comes to cosmetic changes I'm less 'aggressive' in terms of immediately roasting the ideas and slapping '#nochanges' tags all over the place.
---
This is a little bit of a side thought, but I think it actually makes more sense to add all the extra customization options. We want Vanilla to be the same, and it should be. The game should feel the same in terms of gameplay. HOWEVER, we're not the same players anymore. We've grown up as players and we've all become different in one way or another. I think updated customization options could reflect that reality. That we're new people going on a nostalgic adventure. (:
---
Yes, I mean the private servers that reset progress every so often because of corruption, data loss, and shitty project leaders. The private servers that a *lot* of people don't play on because of the lack of reliability (the reliability that Blizzard can *guarantee*, mind you) and lack of quality (ditto). Being "part of the progress" is nothing compared to *knowing* that your character, and your effort, isn't going to be wiped because some 19 year old project lead finally realized one of his fellow leads isn't really into him and decided to fuck the server instead.
---
Nost had to raise it's server cap to 15k, and people still had a massive log in queue. Yes people will come and go, but there will still be a large enough of a population to sustain the *static* game for quite a long time. 
---
This isn't some shitty private server that's being made here.
---
This is such a point of frustration for me. I really wish Blizz would release this gear in phase 2 at the latest. Such cool quest lines and excatly what retail is missing and it's going to be useless gear for most active players.
---
Works for me! Spread the news.
---
I was going to go pretty much the same combo as you but do tailoring/mining and then switch mining to engineering when I get close to 60.  That way I'll have all the mining mats to level my engineering without having to buy them all. I may even do skinning instead of tailoring until lvl 40 to increase my cash flow to buy my mount. 
---
That old yellow crit pop look is so nice. If its not like it used to be looks wise i will 100% be looking for an addon to change it. 
---
1.12 is the version we’re getting, as we’ve seen with talents and AV.
---
You are doing 3 bosses in 11:30, if you get brutal gear and shave off time on the bosses, you can start killing trash for felcloth and the herbs that grow in their packs. 11:30, because you want to be back in the dungeon at 12:00mins to do 5runs per hours without locking out.
---
Gear wise:
---
force reactive disk + dense dynamite takes care of the imps that spawn at the last boss
---
Get some DPS trinkets such as diamond flask
---
100% get gloves that makes you immune to disarm because first and 3rd boss both disarm.
---
First boss: nuke hard, stand to the wall so he cant kick you much.  ezypezy.
---
2nd boss: its my tactic but I found it the most errorfree: you charge, shaman puts down wf totem, immediately after  puts down grounding. Within the 9seconds boss will cast sacrifice and eats your grounding, shaman puts up wf totem again, for another 9secs of wf on your wep and grounding immediately once its off cooldown. 
---
Make sure if you resist grounding to tell your shaman, otherwise he may not notice that grounding got resisted and he can reput wf totem. Or he just installs a enemy castbar addon and watches the boss cast sacrifice and puts down wf afterwards by himself.
---
You can do some LoS healing, but I found that every third run or so, one got sacrificed which just lengthens the fight and not so well geared duos risk a wipe. Just do the wf -&gt; grounding -&gt; wf. That way nobody has to kick or position right and can just nuke 100%. The boss does not hit very hard, so the healer has lots of times juggling the totems while warrior can just focus on DPS.
---
3rd boss is by far the trickiest. 
---
We will see how its in classic, but on pservers you can position him behind a pillar, so when he calls for aid from the flowers, they dont hear him and they dont come to his aid. Needs some getting used to.
---
Wolf form: equip shield + defstance as he does very high damage, treeform: rejuvenates which can be purged by shaman, dont have to kick that. 
---
Normal form: manaburn DoT, kick that or have the shaman immediately cleanse himself.
---
When imps come challenge shout to make them all attack you, have shaman switch to stoneskin ,because the imps will only do 1damage per attack. You dense dynamite + force reactive disk. 
---
Make sure not to kill the boss before you loot the imps as they have a high chance to drop gems which sell for up to 10g (blue sapphires).
---
Have engineering/mining on warrior and atleast disenchanting on shaman. Herbalism can grant a good buck too, if you are willing to go for it. There are lots of gromsblood, dreamfoil and ghost mushrooms lying around. 
---
Obviously always keep 5sunders up on all bosses.
---
Simply put it, players on private servers are not as skilled therefore they need all those buffs to compensate for their lacks of ability.
---
The 1% that completed naxx back then were truly master players so they didn't need to bother as much. 
---
Sucks you can only have 3 pets at once.. 
---
Starving Mountain Lion -&gt; Broken Tooth 
---
Ideally getting ahead of the group then following something like Joannas guide.  I feel like what we will see at launch is unprecedented so noone knows the best way to accomplish that.
---
My plan is to take what the pack allows.  Group for quests and if its even too crowded for that find a spot to grind where quests don't take you.
---
Honestly idk if i would play a beta at this point. I have never played a vanilla pserver and i feel like if i played a beta i would be breaking my own hype. I think i want to wait until official release before i play for the first time. Is that weird? 
---
Elemental shamans are pretty solid in PVP but fail to shine in PVE because of their mana issues. 
---
Resto shamans are pretty solid in PVE and are quite good in PVP. 
---
A split spec will mean that you're a *decent* healer, but lacking in some of the HPS that you'd see with a full resto build. As for damage - most elemental shamans put a large portion of their points into resto anyways (nature's swiftness is key for bursting in PVP).
---
If you'd like some more general info, MadSeasonShow is my preferred content creator on the subject of Classic. He's great to listen to, doesn't do the typical over-hyped-youtuber thing, and provides some great information.
---
Any blue post=riot
---
So it's agreed upon between Alliance and Horde that there shall be no more gnome players.
---
***Cross-Faction Handshake***
---
But what is going to keep people playing?  If I grind and grind and get through Naxx, what is gonna keep me logging on?  That is a very real question for a lot of people. and it is one that Blizz has to answer. Nost having 15k is nothing.  Retail has millions of subs, blizz is not interested in opening classic servers for 20k people.  They want classic to pull in and keep a large amount of players, and for that they need to supply some form of content after Naxx.  Whether its moving on to TBC, or doing what Runescape did and making content the community votes on, or some mixture of both,  they will need to do something or else classic servers will putter out after a few years.
---
classic size  8/10gigs max i think
---
I've got my money on June 21st. You've heard it here first folks!
---
A lot of people will try it and hate it. Ive brought a few people to private servers to play and the reality is that its a much different game. 3/4 players that seemed interested in nostalgia realized this wasn't the game for them anymore. If you are a horde player, it will only take a few deaths in the southern barrens quests with run backs to thin out the population.
---
Obviously there are no Paladins on Horde and that means Warrior tanks lack three distinct advantages over their Alliance counterparts:
---
1. No Blessing of Salvation
---
2. No Blessing of Kings
---
3. No Devotion Aura
---
What does that mean in practice for Warrior tanks?  
---
Horde Warriors need to wear more mitigation gear than Alliance tanks. More mitigation gear means less threat generation and even greater reliance on weapon upgrades to further push threat. Having no Blessing of Salvation you can see why Horde DPS are a lot closer to tanks on threat meters.
---
How does being Horde affect Feral tanks?  
---
Feral has one very decent advantage over Horde Warriors. Maul is multiplicative, and you're not weapon dependent because you attack with your claws which is how you're able to be competitive with Warriors. Even when they have WF totem you're always competitive on threat. Yes you're slightly less tanky, but you have a lot more threat generation. This is actually great because it creates a niche for you where you're the one who can push threat like nobody's business and not suffer the same threat penalties that Warriors do when they stack up on mitigation.
---
Feral tanks are raid viable and they're worth bringing along to raids. I've tanked as Feral from MC all through Naxx on private servers and we were more than satisfied with how the spec performed, though it's a given that it had some limitations. It's not great for Ouro for example since you have no dependable active mitigation.  
---
Though you should know that being the Feral tank can be a pain in the butt. You more or less can't get around the fact that you need to farm Manual Crowd Pummelers in Gnomeregan on a weekly basis. I enjoyed playing Feral tank but it came with a lot of extra work that I didn't foresee.
---
Admins please pin this thanks :)
---
The same damage? Hell no man. I said Viable not optimal. I just think they need to make Ret and Enhance viable options. If they made them optimal that would be a disaster. 
---
This perfectly answered my question, thank you!
---
Groups of 3 have the highest xp per split , so try to get that for all players. Don't compete with each other's groups early as far as quest mobs go, and y'all should be fine. 
---
This too - obviously!
---
Too bad his post is about him feeling ugly and 0 about other people commenting "nice gear bro" but nice strawman. I don't even get the point of making up an argument here? Are you trying to convince people to play on RP servers or do you just like bullshiting?
---
My pets with be an armored boar pink flamingo and the tiger I tame at 10. 
---
Im going to see how the game actually is for a couple weeks via reviews/videos/streams before doing anything. I'm done giving Blizzard money before seeing a product so if it meets my expectation I'll probably move over. Otherwise, my pserver isn't shutting down and may progress to TBC so I'm good even if classic gets screwed up.
---
They're weird and they're shit. Get yourself a warrior and feel good about yourself.
---
I feel like joannas path will be overcrowded. But you're probably right in the sense of nobody knows what launch will allow us to do. 
---
I guess I'm looking for an answer what is the overall fastest way to level? If you can get a group of 5 people to spam dungeons, would that be faster for a group? Like a well organized group and pretty well optimized class comp? Or is it still faster to quest by yourelf and just run a dungeon a couple times for gear. 
---
Cutting edge raiding and autoattack bound on 1. Checks out.
---
Release date, beta details, PvP details, progressive itemization details, in that order
---
So you think just getting in trio groups and running quests or should we grind off mobs as a group of 3? 
---
Ranking and getting exalted are very different though. With ranking you are racing with other players, which can get really tedious and difficult, especially at higher ranks when you fight the decay as well. 
---
With reputation farm you only need to do a predetermined amount of matches and there is no decay.
---
We also don't know when BGs will be released. It could be even at phase0 (with nerfed or missing rewards) or later as it was in vanilla. That completely changed how difficult it will be to farm the reputation out.
---
Sorry!  Those were the only screenshots known to exist of the Orc Zug.  We parted ways at some point, I switched guilds, life continues.
---
I'm not a number cruncher by any means, so this is mostly just my opinion, but I've leveled both Ally and Horde and I can honestly say that i feel like leveling on the Horde side is much easier, especially in the lower levels.  Ally seems to have to zone hop a lot more and it FEELS like they have less quests, which means its more time consuming/grinding.  Horde have to sit in the barrens forever, but it does make it easier.  Additionally, with very few exceptions, I find Horde Flight Paths much more convenient as well.
---
Vanilla wow isn't hard. I am not sure how this idea keeps getting perpetuated. Its slow and time consuming, but not hard. Yes, you die more while leveling, but there is not a real penalty for death.  Leveling takes forever, but there are tons of players at every level in the same boat doing the content. Its a different experience and a totally different game - but its also very casual friendly; just not alt friendly.
---
If you are ahead of the pack questing supplemented by grinding isnthe best way.  I would say dungeon grinding is the not anywhere near the top in fastest even with a crowded realm.
---
If you have 2 pets for leveling, then one of your pets will be roughly your level, and the other pet will be whatever level it was when you put it in the stables.
---
**For Solo Play:**
---
* **Boars** are the best early on because they have charge
---
* Once you can get Dive and Screech onto a bird, they become the best.  Screech is enough AoE threat to cover Mend Pet (or a Multi-Shot here and there) so it becomes much easier to hold aggro.  If you value Screech over Charge (especially for Alliance, since Screech 2 comes from Westfall), then you may opt to go bird right away.  This includes **Bats, Carrion Birds, and Owls**.  My favorite is Carrion Birds, because Bite meshes well with screech.
---
**For Group PvE:**
---
* **Wolves** are nice because they have Furious Howl.  This is good for you if your pet is next to you, and great for the group.  If Lupos does shadow damage early on, even better.  Furious howl isn't as much threat as Screech, but it is a slight AoE threat boost.
---
* **Wind Serpents** can DPS from a range, so that's nice.  They're also decent for solo play, but not as good as a boar or bird (in my opinion).
---
* **Cats** have high damage between their raw output and their abilities.  
---
**For PvP:**
---
* **Boar** charge immobilizes, which is good.
---
* **Cats** have prowl.  They're best on a Night Elf hunter to combine with Shadowmeld.  It's a good tactic for going AFK and might make them good for solo, too.  A good cat with a fast attack is death to casters.
---
* **Scorpids** have Scorpid Poison, which makes it harder to dispel your stings.
---
* **Lupos**, depending on which version we get at launch, might be a good option as well.
---
Overall, I prefer pets that can dash/dive/charge for any of these (Scorpids are the only one I list that cannot).  I like to stay away from abilities with long cooldowns (i.e. Turtles and Gorillas).  If I'm using growl, I prefer Bite to be my focus dump over Claw, because then I don't miss out on growls.  On a DPS pet I don't care as much.
---
Some people also don't care for the noise owls make either but I kinda like them aesthetically as well. At least cat/wolf/raptor aren't too far behind. If only bears had a better set of abilities to go with their stats.
---
&gt;What is the best leveling strategy?
---
I'll post details on day 3 of launch.
---
In practice there really is no difference in having gear continue to scale with higher tier encounters and having a new level cap.
---
horde tanks need to go berserker for the immunity
---
use 2-3 tremor totems dropped not at the same time
---
maybe a 2nd tank for a 2nd berserker
---
Indeed. Just good luck learning charge 4 ;) There's no beast knowing it. 
---
Again If thats what you wanna do I am not gonna throw shade. For me though I'll pass on a Shaman. Intelligent chain healz and all. Hence why I said if you wanna be a totems bitch. Which is how I feel about resto. Unless you get that god mode AQ 40 gear. Resto just a chain healing totems bitch. No thanks, I'll pass.
---
Slowing down the raid! 
---
This was my line of thinking as well, but people here also suggest WF grants a huge boost to warrior threat, which negates the gain bears receive from not having salvation on either side. I'm still conflicted on this.
---
I am well aware of the MCP part, but that only happens if you are MTing a boss, correct?
---
Just reroll man. There is your wipe.
---
Plainstrider, Coyote, Wind Serpent
---
It really is one of the best they've ever made.
---
&gt; Yes, that's a shadow priest tanking Onyxia.

You might be able to join a guild discord and just hangout without playing. Depends on the guild. That said, complaining about leveling might not get you that much traction with "good guilds". Nothing really matters until you're level 60 anyway. If you hit 60 and start getting good gear early, you'll be able to join a good guild.
---
I want to know if the server rules will be similar to Vanilla.  For example:
---
* Cannot transfer from PvE realm to PvP realm
---
* Cannot have Alliance and Horde on same PvP realm
---
* Character limit of 10 per server, maximum of 50
---
The best way to level is a very efficient questing route (like Joanna's) supplemented with grinding along the way.
---
If you're levelling with friend(s) you will soon find out you will get behind on level when following a route as xp from grinding is simply less when killing mobs from A to B.
---
I found that you can somewhat easily fill these gaps by doing a dungeon with all dungeon quests, giving you gear to help questing later on. This is especially helpfull if one of you plays a gear dependant class like a melee.
---
Selfish but respected.
---
It really grinds my gears when people are writing guides and detailed analys of extremely niche gameplay mechanics about Classic when its not even out yet.
---
Which phase adds the Duke of Cynders?
---
I can kind of see plainstrider and coyote because they come from Mulgore.  But I don't recall any wind serpents in Mulgore.
---
lol roleplayer

Yes, paladin fear was completely overhauled and optimized in tbc, it’s a mosh mash of random stats in vanilla and really only works for holy in vanilla. 
---
Gorilla. Cause they’re the beefiest.
---
&gt; If you can get a group of 5 people to spam dungeons, would that be faster for a group?
---
oh god no, not unless you're grossly OP.
---
At level 20, you should be able to get up to 18,000 - 20,000 xp/h  by straight grinding.
---
Killing every mob in the Deadmines should net you about 10,600xp in a group of 5. So unless you're clearing the dungeon, resetting back to the entrance to start again every 32 minutes, might as well just head out into the wilderness and kill shit.
---
EPL bats are like 50g an hour just vendoring grey items if you have a good kill rate.
---
probably cuz at least one of the big classic ps are supposed to shut down after release
---
As lame as it sounds, farming leather is probably the activity i'm looking forward to the most.
---
That is simply not true
---
Give me RP-PvP!!!
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Wind_serpent
---
Take a look at this. There are many wind serpents in the game with Tauren names. There are some quests given by Taurens to hunt them down etc. They're a part of their myth culture
---
I would give you if I could.
---
MCP is for MTing yes.  
---
You'll still beat Warriors with WF. Remember that WF is an attack-based proc. Even though the proc rate is decent Warrior abilities still generate a flat amount, and WF doesn't proc on every attack.
---
Nobody can beat a Druid with MCP on threat.
---
TJ 86
---
Someone above mentioned that it's a private server only bug.
---
because pressing zerk stance, zerk rage, defensive stance is very hard for vanilla players apparently
---
also pretty sure you can drop tremor totem at the exact moment fear goes off and the 1st pulse will clear it instantly.  at least that worked for nightbane fear on gummy but who fucking knows with private servers
---
What’s that mace you’re using in the last pick?
---
Because, as I said, the coolness is a side effect of a (social) game mechanic. 
---
[Castigator](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22808)
---
Seconding all that. I'll also add that Horde are sheltered by The Barrens and other low/mid level zones for much longer than Alliance. So early on Horde are far less likely to be ganked or run into enemy faction players than Alliance are. 
---
Pffffft i only come to these threads for Zug!
---
but seriously, good stuff man did you guys end getting KT down?
---
Why do you need a beta? We know the game, the point is that the game will be the same. Unless you want to bugtest for them.
---
What do you mean? Resistance's effect and formulas are known well. Only the specific resistance value of a certain mob might not be known, but that's irrelevant here. 
---
Thanks for the reply! I was mostly looking for options and not “optimal faction/number crunching” so this is helpful.
---
No its not. It's just smart.
---
Ok ok ok. . Let's split the difference.. Casually Hardcore then.  
---
There wasn't much information going around back then, these days people are better prepared for encounters and actually took the time to learn their class.
---
Thanks for the reply! I was mostly curious about people’s opinions and not so much the number crunching so this was helpful. 
---
I really liked having non cross realm BG's too. It might be okay if it was just two servers paired as sister servers. To me though, when they did battlegroups I went from recognizing most everyone in a BG to maybe 2-3 people in an AB including my own team; really lame.
---
That really calms me. I'm currently leveling a beartank (55 atm) on a well established server (AQ opened few weeks ago) and plan on doing the same on classic. Farming for MCP does seem like a chore, but I plan on mostly being OT and MTing only the fights were bears are clearly superior (like resistance fights)
---
GDP isn't a great measurement of how much disposable income young adults have. Also, Blizzard has previously charged less money for people who live in countries with less wealth. Granted, they would likely be playing in a separate server region from NA or EU.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Well you won't be doing Naxx then...
---
You can just collect two sets, one for PvE and one for PvP. Cloth and leather items usually have better stats for PvE, but for PvP you can just focus on more armor, stamina and intellect and get healing from where you can.
---
I was curious about this myself. I switched servers and classes during aq40 and missed playing with that bug. I'll see if I can dig through the patch notes and find it
---
Spent hours recently when trying retail to get the original text back. Can't be done. You can get text floating around on your screen if you want, but you can't get the original classic text above the target you're hitting. The floating nature of addon battle text just feels disconnected, even if it can sort of mimic "popping" crits, it's way different. Had to find an addon which enabled "hidden" blizzard interface options or some such nonsense to get it close. 
---
Gnomes.
---
This was the first WoW video I watched and what got me into WoW. Before that I just used to see the PC boxes in the stores and read em and thought it was super cool to be in a fantasy world with others!
---
How many different keybindings does an end game Warlock need for raiding and pvp including consumables?
---
Alot bigger than 2gb.
---
Played Alliance on Medivh in vanilla, between you and Bbb (I think that was their name) you guys would eat me in pvp regularly. Ah man the good old days
---
Anything earlier than late August and I'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
Obviously it's very much personal opinion, but I  like the idea of getting better gear if you put in more effort. BFA for example is so easy to gear, I don't find there's that much competition - which is something you may like 
---
Just like vanilla. By the time this dropped my main priest was in t2+,my alt hunter was in t2/PvP rewards, and my 2nd alt rogue was in bit of DS1/T1/ZG. I ended up doing the full tier .5 for the rogue. Total blast doing it with my guild's main druid healer. If I recall we duoed everything but the strat run (just brought some guildie mains with t2+) and then pugged whatever that harder summonable guy was. I think we handed out pots or some other consumables to the pugs.
---
Good times.
---
Guilds are about to have to put together some HR departments to work on retention.
---
Yeah, and those are very useful for being resto or ele/resto hyrbid. Good luck getting anyone near that hunter, mage, druid or warlock that's even only half of max distance from you. Tremor totem isn't instant so you get feared, run for a second and a half, start running to him again, dots are ticking, grounding totem, he casts some useless instant dot as he's running, fears you again. You come out of it and you're dead. Enhancement is garbage unless you're playing against literal apes in some testing lab.
---
Yeah, I had already planned on multiple gear sets. I guess I’m just worried about the Paladin’s ability to heal in PvP settings with the higher armor yet lower +healihg gear. I know they were still strong based off what I’ve read, just didnt know it if altered playstyle drastically. 
---
Thanks! 
---
How hard and time consuming (or impossible during launch?) is it for a horde to tame an owl in Teldrassil and learn screech from a carrion bird in Westfal? I know kinda insane, but I'd like to level with one and the becomes I know are at level 48
---
Also, is it even worth leveling an owl when you will only have screech one till level 32.
---
Alternative for me would be to level with a wind serpent
---
YOU found dozens of people while YOU were leveling.  The issue becomes more pronounced depending on server population, available tanks, and whether they are even interested in running a dungeon because tanks gear up super quickly.  Otherwise, you spend a bunch of time whispering every potential tank and then dealing with the fallout of whether or not they actually understood what they’re doing or if they just took the spot because people were desperate for dungeon slots and then tried to figure out what all those tanking buttons did.  
---
Sick of hearing about shit not mattering, when it does. It adds to the feel/experience of vanilla. It is fucking annoying.
---
Thanks for using a 1994 movie to make a meme for a 2004 game on reddit which is usually 14-20 year olds. I feel young again!
---
Wait nope, there's the knee pain....
---
You can't MT being a demonology Warlock either. Why do hybrid classes need to be able to raid with all three specs when no one else can?
---
Shhhh.... don't tell people about it!
---
Just roll an alt on a low pop server.
---
Do you play EU/NA/OC/AS Horde/Alliance PVE/RP/PVP/RP-PVP? There's plenty of Guilds recruiting already. So you don't need to find a guild on a private server.
---
Not tameable in 1.12.
---
Depends. You want that onslaught girdle?
---
So many good videos from back in the day!
---
Yeah I see your point. At the time when I was making the list I was mostly thinking about having to compete as a "new" returning player vs the guys who have been playing on private servers this whole time.
---
OP is lying. He's posted here before. Twice in the past 3 months. 
---
Nostalrius was one of the most popular private servers available that was forced to shutdown by Blizzard. It was one of the biggest sparks in interest for the Classic revival. On another note, I was in the Dark Legacy guild that resided on the server Lightbringer, once upon a time around 2005/06. The artist was a rogue named Keydar. The comics were based on the guild tank Mijikai, Keydar, and a priest name Gigz I believe. I don't remember her name entirely, it's something like that :D
---
There are multiple raids and some reset in under a week so expect a healthy playing schedule. One night a week would be taking it pretty slowly. But I am sure you’ll find people with a similar schedule and goals. 
---
i played league and rust for so long that the idea of the entire game just reseting on 0 and having to start over was appealing, after i reached 60 i actually insisted we go on another server with nothing and start all over again, i have so much more fun as low lvl character then i do as a 60 nowadays 
---
Periodic release of fresh and/or seasonal servers accomplish the goal just fine, and will likely prolong the lifespan of Classic by quite a bit.
---
There's absolutely no reason to simply delete everyone's characters after a set period of time.
---
Beaststalker Dungeon set will be in launch.
---
The upgrade version Beastmaster won't be until later.
---
Ah, okay.  That definitely wouldnt surprise me.  
---
I find horde leveling quicker because questing is more simple and straightfoward. I feel like I am changing zones way more as alliance at lower levels.
---
1. This wasn't a problem in 1.12
---
2. They already said that they aren't going to do any balance changes
---
July 16th boys
---
Multiboxing ban
---
It's funny how polarizing this set is for me. On one hand because of it's release time it isn't really useful. On the other hand to me it represents vanilla super well. Long unique quest chain + materials + time investment. Going all over the world to track this stuff down. It won't be an upgrade but I might do this just for the experience, maybe on an alt it would be perfect.
---
Druids are better 5man tanks than warriors.
---
&gt; You can also farm DM:E duos which is a fury warrior in plate DPS gear + shaman. Very much doable with Dal'rends + plate PvE gear as you only need like 5-6% hit for your dualwielding, so you can aim for +ap and crit.
---
DM:E jump runs can be done with pretty much any Melee + healer combo. Druid + Rogue is a solid one.
---
But isnt that kinda weird ? How do you see if you like them or not if you dont play together ? Am I weird here ? 
---
I don't think leveling was as much an issue as you say.  Even if it was I don't see them adding quests.  
---
No class changes.
---
They are using the newer client for classic so I doubt this would work. If you want to play multiple characters at once, you will need multiple accounts.
---
Damn that's pretty cool! Can we see any resemblance from you in these comics? I remember that the creator sometimes included people outside of the core!
---
&gt; So be a tank, be able to solo DM, or be in a 5man? The rest of those require some measure of luck (rare patterns/AH) or don't give 60g/hr outside of devilsaur/black lotus....and honestly unless the tank is getting more than one orb, strat isn't gonna be 60g/hr.
---
If you're farming gold for raiding consumables the idea is to get a guild 5m run going. It makes for fast runs for more gold per unit of time. Also a greater level of equity in the distribution of gold.
---
Why didn't you use the heart of the wild spec? 0/30/21
---
Emergency monitor, good guy Rogue
---
Since I main a pally, and I'll be doing holy/prot for the gearup to raiding/pvp (with plans for 20/0/31 a long way down the road after I've gotten some gear and AV is out), it's sounding like I need to take an even closer look at strat that I have been.
---
I’m not sure honestly. I tried to play BFA and couldn’t use a 2 letter name. I can’t recall if it was taken or if it just didn’t allow it. 
---
better not be, i'm away that weekend
---
Sorry for that, but thanks for proving me wrong :)
---
I'm guessing 22 September.
---
Gnome
---
Great for punting
---
You can still have multiple clients running, and you always needed multiple accounts.
---
The issue if a tank knows what he is doing remains the same with the dungeon finder tool.  
---
That is not the issue.
---
The issue is the parallel universe you get teleported in and out of with strangers you'll never see again.
---
It removes the best aspect of the dungeon.  
---
A sense of traveling to a dangerous place. Grouping up there and heading in together as a group.  
---
Even if you are having trouble with a person in your group you are stuck there together and you will have to pull trough together to the end. Isn't that the best part. Instead of kick and teleport a new randomer inside.
---
And if a person in the group doesn't do well. You can always help and advise him. He has some sort of social skill after all since he replied to your whisper.
---
Unlike current WoW where you can talk all you want but nobody cares to reply.
---
1. Yeah in a 1.12 world, leveling will be have less "grind x mobs" because there are a lot more quests, compared to how it was on live. If you played on Nostalrius (or its successor server) at launch, you may have noticed that your leveling guides told you to do quests which didn't exist. This is because these servers did a progressive release of some quests. I don't expect Blizzard to do a progressive quest release though, so Classic shouldn't have this issue.
---
2. It seems like they'll probably be in their 1.12 state. Whether Blizzard makes changes to the classes to either better balance them or make them more representative of how they were throughout all of Vanilla is probably going to depend in large part on the feedback of the community. Here's the relevant quote from the WoWhead blizzcon interview:
---
"We don't have any plans to make changes to any of the balancing in 1.12. We're starting with 1.12 because we feel like it's the most complete and balanced version of the game that was available at that period. That's where we're starting at, because we feel like it was very complete. I don't wanna say that we wouldn't listen to the community, obviously because the community's passion and feedback are really important and we really believe that every voice matters. We're always listening. But we do wanna make sure that we get this authentic recreation, because if you want the modern balance changes, we have those in Battle for Azeroth. If we wanted to get what we would do today, we have that. It's already available. But we don't have what we did back then, and we wanna give back people what we did back then, especially on things like class balance and that authentic gameplay experience and those authentic gameplay systems the way that they worked."
---
You cite AV. AV is 1.12 like the rest of the client.
---
Why on Earth would we start asking for class balance changes out of nowhere? Why would blizzard arbitrarily change level xp after recognizing the 1.12 data as sacrosanct.
---
Ahh gotcha, I think they're just gonna power through and you'll barely interact with them, except in PvP which you stand a good chance as hard-core players are generally good at PvE and suck at PvP.
---
With raiding I hope there's loads of guilds for people like us as you mention, where they just through together 40 man raids and progress from there, which I think there will be a lot of :D 
---
What a horrible proposal.
---
You were never able to play multiple characters at once on one account. That would be insane. You need a 2nd account.
---
I don't have any shots of it.  I'm not even sure.  I remember doing the fight, but with all the changes and versions and time away from the game I get it mixed up sometimes, so it may just be me remembering KT from later.
---
There would have been only a bit over a month to do both Saphirron and KT, so maybe that's as far as I got.
---
While it's very likely true to be a bug, it's very hard to prove. So that's what we get.
---
I had no knowledge of it since I didn’t play it. I only go off of things that I hear. 
---
This is true, and I was definitely thinking from the perspective of a player farming solo.
---
What do I want to hear next? "We here at Blizzard are excited to announce. Thanks to block chain technology ( I don't know about block chains they are just magic to me) Thanks to block chain technology we will now be able to pay our players. Yes that is right ladies and gentleman thanks to the forbidden knowledge of block chain technology. We will now be sending 10$ to your bank account for every 1 gold you make in the world of warcraft. 
---
Is Hurricane hired by Blizzard yet?
---
it would boost the 5man scene too
---
more people would do strat dm scholo brd its good for all
---
Also regarding priest, when you said deep holy with power infusion, do you mean the 31/18 spec you have linked in the description?  I guess I just didn't think of 18 points as especially deep, but I can see that spec being pretty powerful.
---
That’s true. I’m always having to change zones every few levels. Thank you!
---
Blizzard is most certainly interested in servers for 20k people. Hell, they're interested in servers for 10s of people people:
---
&gt; [If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And **if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way**. What’s important to us is that we have this Classic experience people can enjoy, that people do have the opportunity to go back to.](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
&gt; [One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik's wife, and then they're done. That's fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that's what we'll be providing.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions)
---
Sure they want to pull in a lot of people, but that's not what Classic is about and they've stated that. They clearly do not plan or want to pursue anything past Naxx on these servers because it would loop back around to where we are now: people wanting Classic servers.
---
As to what will keep you playing, it's whatever you find fun. Perhaps you've one of the people that Brack mentioned there who will do the Nostalgia trip and then move along. And that's *okay*. It's *okay* to move on from a game once *you* have gotten all the fun you can. The rest of us will just roll a new character because that's what's fun to us and we are the target audience here.
---
If you're talking about absolute best, Joana consistently hit world firsts as a Troll Hunter.
---
Definitely a Plainstrider.
---
I'd also say Owl, something very spiritual and "communing with nature" about them, but as a Tauren you wouldn't be able to get one before level \~48 unless you something managed to get to Teldrassil. 
---
It's not a fix because nothing is broken. Maybe since we are suggesting more hairstyles, it won't be a big deal to include more mounts in the game either. I mean the art assets already exist.  
---
Nevermind the goal of recreating vanilla 1:1 if it means I can have more hair options right?  
---
You are right though. The content already does exist. It's in retail. Go play dress up there.  
---
Yeah I worded that very poorly, would have been more clear to say deep disc with power infusion... at least the spec is on the screen I guess haha
---
There was never really a lack of questsn, except maybe at launch. People just skipped lots of quests (maybe because they weren't all easy to find). Aside from that, we know they won't be bringing in balance changes 
---
Regarding AV, the version that we're getting is the one from the end of Vanilla. While this isn't the full on war scenario that many of us wanted, it is still part of Vanilla, and isn't indicative at all of Blizzard changing things.
---
To this day, the only confirmed changes (IIRC) are modern netcode, slightly updated graphics options (resolution, colourblind modes, etc.), loot trading in raid locked instances, and we also know that Blizzard is looking into implementing sharding and Battle.net integration.
---
How exactly they will handle the addon-situation. They said somewhere that they won't use the old API, as it was too strong in terms of basically being able to put a whole rotation on a single button. On the other hand, the current API is strong in other areas - we have addons that basically take away our need to think or watch our positioning in raid encounters. Sure, you could argue that classic bosses aren't the most complex ones, but you can bet that there will be an addon made for C'thun for example (no idea if there already is one).
---
Also, does that whole messing with the API mean that we can't use currently available 1.12.1 versions of addons at launch? If not, can we just port the current versions of our addons to classic? I'm not an addon creator myself so fairly a noob, please bear with me.
---
Mazzranache of course :D
---
Totally agree. Imbalance provokes creative thinking.
---
Is that *the* Ascent? Of BWL fame? 
---
:)  
---
Having played both, I will say this:
---
Both are fun and have unique cities. I love Thunderbluff and Orgrimmar as much as I love Stormwind. I don't much care for Valley of Trials so I wouldn't roll Orc or Troll but I LOVE Mulgore.
---
I love the Brill and Sepulcher quest hubs but it's gloomy as heck.
---
" I understand this is a Classic WoW reddit so the likelihood of people not wanting to play in this forum is pretty slim to none."
---
Yup
---
Not necessarily looking for the best, just what’s different. That is good info to know though!
---
Yeah ive watched a ton of his videos. Him and Kargoz are my go-to's. Thank you though, I will have to rewatch the shaman sections of MadSeason's since I just focused on warrior until now 
---
TBH i really dislike this modern trailer... old school was so much better.... ghost saying "no one goes home until we are done?" i mean come on ... 
---
# FRESH!!!!!
---
Pretty much.
---
Guess I should roll a Tauren on a PvE server then.
---
fuck off
---
Would you attempt this without engineering?
---
Ret Pallys and Boomkins get massive upgrades all other classes nerfed. 
---
As far as I'm aware, no. I wasn't in the "cool kids" club lol. I joined a bit later and was very vocal about calling out favoritism. If I wasn't considered a good healer, I probably would have been kicked before appearing in a comic lol. 
---
Comes out right on winter for us in the southern hemisphere. Nothing will quite beat playing classic wow wrapped up in a blanket or the heat cranked all the way up.
---
Maybe we reward them for a job well done, they'll take WoW in a different direction.  I'm definitely playing, I need some 40 man raids and world PVP in my life again.  The hardest decision is playing my original main Warlock or skip right to Priest since I love healing.
---
You’ll end up playing classic. They’ll all end up playing!
---
Thank you for your valuable input. Have a nice day. 
---
Literally everything they've done so far is push the game closer to authentic 1.12. 
---
Realm pop will be authentic to 1.12, cross realm BGs will be authentic to 1.12. They're very clearly not interested in making modifications to a known working formula. 
---
I was honestly going to pass. After the past couple of years Blizzard has done nothing but disappoint me. BFA, Destiny (allowing it on their platform to begin with) the Diablo phone thing. I was set in my ways I would not play classic.
---
But....
---
As the months passed and the day gets closer, all the blue posts all the hype...it is safe to say, I will be playing classic when it comes out haha
---
there is no valuable input to be given this topic has been discussed a thousand times and yet you still make a new post.
---
Oi, you just want to reserve the good names for you! Crossblesser, Faithmelter &amp; co will be mine this time!
---
I didn't pvp much... I just enjoyed pve way more.
---
[pvp on jan 1, 2006](https://i.imgur.com/Tm10KQS.jpg) is the only shot of me having done some pvp.  Any familiar names?  
---
You need 3 hands for those binds! I always laugh at the 1 being devoted to auto attack as well. Classic sign of vanilla. 
---
 If I haven’t heard of it then it’s information. You just seem to have a problem with people wanting to be informed on things they don’t know. Enjoy your wonderful life. 
---
My hunter will be a solo grinding alt only (I mained one throughout retail) and will be supported by his trusty Boar sidekick, Applesauce.
---
&gt; Pointless
---
unless u like how it looks
---
for me, farming is a valid part of endgame.  i miss it, and can't wait to get back to it.
---
the last thing i did in-game before cata is make a few laps around azshara on my miner/herber rogue...  
---
purely for nostalgia sake i want to have another lookalike toon for that role, but i'm pretty sure whatever toon i get to 60 first is going to be a miner/herber until i can get my rogue leveled  =)
---
Who are you kidding?
---
Normally people don’t type a one page report about things they don’t want to do. I’ll see you at launch though. I hope you find peace in your quest to find your personal brand and social mission, redditor.

Taking Blizzard at their word for that being the actual reason and repeating it is shilling*

The main reason for a beta would be to gauge players. I think we will see a beta/free-weekend style deal at some point. Login, get an instant level 45 or something (probably not 60, they don't want to give away that experience), and a relatively open world. 
---
It's going to be REALLY hard for them to gauge server count pre-launch without one. And having too many/too few servers are both major problems. 
---
This is another conundrum for me. Believe it or not, I was a person that actually enjoyed raid healing on my Pally, then taking my T2/T2.5 gear into battlegrounds and one shotting squishies because "balanced pvp" lol. I miss the healing and my original pally, although boring to many. I've told myself I want it to be a different experience though and will likely go mage if I do play.
---
Realm Location.
---
They've got servers hosted in Chicago and I want low latency while I'm eating my Mama Luna's deep dish pizza.
---
Yeah true. I figure tier 0 will take me long enough. May have to work on some BiS gear while I wait for tier .5
---
Ascent from Medivh/Thrall US.   oldschool everquest guys.  I wasn't there since the beginning when they first killed Ragnaros or anything though, but I stuck around through most of tbc.
---
Horde leveling zones are more fun.
---
If you don't want 1.12 then Classic definitely isn't the game for you. 
---
Yeah so just looking at it from a math prespective... 
---
If you do a quest solo that takes 10 minutes to get 12 bandanas from defias. You get 50 xp per kill, have to kill say 15 to get your bandanas and then get 500 xp from the quest turn in. You're getting 1250 xp in saying 12 minutes with running. 
---
If you're in a group of 3 now getting say 15-20 xp per kill, you would have to kill 63 defias to get the same XP. But you would be killing them so much faster with no down time. To get the same XP for the quest you'd have to kill 4.2 defias per minute which i dont think would be hard at all. Youd probably kill a lot more.
---
Honestly having 4 pure dps averaging with only roughly 100 dps or so difference really just tells me that hunters need to be bought in line, for the pure dps class (although one could argue warrior is a hybrid I suppose), as pure dps classes I don't see how then being at the top is in any way unusual.
---
Ever heard of not being an asshole? You literally are up my ass because I asked for people opinions on things about information that I didn’t know was public. Literally being rude to someone asking something they don’t know. It’s really unnecessary. You literally could have said nothing. But you seem to care so much about being a dick that you must shut down someone asking simple questions. Good day.

Release date
---
You were never able to simultaneous play multiple characters on the same account. You were able to play multiple characters simultaneously before with multiple accounts before, you are able to in retail now, and you will be able to in classic.

Good insight here.
---
Regardless of outcome, it's something I wanted to see how others felt. I'm also a person that likes to put context to things and share background or experience on the matter before spurting out random thoughts and/or passive aggressive comments that contribute nothing to a post.
---
You mainly get exaulted by the time you're rank 11ish though and at that point you are two away from 13
---
They've refined reporting through 13 years of development, if it's in the game at all, they're definitely using their current system. 
---
"Something need doing?"
---
I will have a couple accounts but it wouldn't make logical sense to be able to form my own raid by multi-logging with them.
---
There's no way that's a thing. Lol
---
A hyena, because I love them. Screw the "bis" attitude, It's all about pure aesthetics for me.
---
I sense after Classic drops, Pservers will be hit hard by Activision.
---
Silverlight with the great pictures once again
---
"Get ready for a Classic Summer" implies early in the Summer, though
---
Some of the comments here are interesting. 
---
Don’t worry, my friend, you’re not alone. I feel you on so many levels. I sometimes feel like I need a support group but wonder how many of us are in this same boat. I guess we know now that there are at least two of us hah. 
---
Dont play a druid

FYI: Blockchain is a “distributed, immutable ledger” technology. The ELI5 definition: Any product you buy likely has been touched by multiple suppliers/manufacturers to turn the raw resources into a usable product. With blockchain, there is a master list of all transactions between those suppliers, and every supplier has their own identical copy of the master list. From a security perspective, a single supplier can’t alter that list successfully, because everyone else could compare their own list and see that one single supplier’s list had been changed. To successfully fudge the numbers, you would have to change everyone’s list individually. This is also beneficial in a food context, because you can successfully trace every single group who interacted with a piece of romaine lettuce, all the way back to the farm that it was grown on, which makes it very easy to spot the source of a problem within minutes, versus having to shut down an entire industry for a month while inspectors check each farm individually. I hope that explained it a little!
---
Than
---
Totally
---
Yea they are but not as efficient as mages or hunters.  You can still farm DM:E lasher runs. 
---
Hunters can do princess runs solo or sell them to other players.
---
Or you cann sell your body as a warrior to groups that need a tank.
---
Mages can solo aoe farm great too.
---
I think
---
Hunter &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock  but thats just imo
---
Depends on the server economy and when you start with farming. Some items such as  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18317](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18317)  Tempest Talisman only sells for 1g25s to vendor when shards will eventually cost 4-6g. So (dis-)enchanting and mining are considered mandatory for this kind of farming.
---
Being warrior, being shaman and going engineering will just make this farming accessible earlier. You can do it later on with rogue + druid for example, but it's less efficient DPS wise.
---
How you distribute your professions among you two does not really matter. Just ench + mining mandatory, herbalism a nice bonus.
---
Have a cleaner UI in 2005-2006 than I do now.
---
$300 to $450 an hour to farm Mara on a Hunter? Sounds Splendid.
---
Literally everybody would be a multiboxer 
---
The first couple days will be the worst to be in a low level zones though.
---
Whoa whoa whoa Blizzard, change the release! RossFromBritain will be away that weekend!
---
So does that mean you're not going to shop at walmart, use apple or samsung, use internet providers, watch organized sports, wear name brand clothes, watch hollywood tv or movies, drive a vehicle, get a bank loan, etc, etc...?
---
All those companys/businesses have done worse things than "change video games you used to like"
---
It’s $15 a month, I spent that on lunch today.
---
Could not give a shit about anything else blizzard has done, i will play classic and if it’s fun I’ll keep playing, that is only thing that matters to me.
---
/startattack did not work in macros in vanilla
---
Blizz likes to steal release dates so im guessing July 2
---
Also the fact that most private servers have super overtuned content (boss health and damage) to make the fights artificially more difficult. Anything to maintain their player base for as long as possible.
---
Yeah we know how much our own resistances is, but how it affects spells is guesswork AFAIK. Tipsout talks about it here for a minute or two [https://youtu.be/RYepdsfid4w?t=510](https://youtu.be/RYepdsfid4w?t=510)    
---
I'd love some evidence showing we actually do know specifics when it comes to resistances, and that goes both ways. Damage we deal and damage we take from bosses.  
---
what if new players feel like it is less of a grind and more of an immersive game with realistic progression. we see it as a grind as we have experienced the leveling process maybe times. but people who have never done it may find it to be "the game" 
---
Right - the purpose of this thought experiment is to find a way to balance the game without making changes that were outside of 1.12. If we're operating under that constraint, then our options are limited. We can buff hunters by reverting the 1.9 lupos nerf and the 1.10 ranged damage normalization - but that's it, and that wouldn't be very big. What we do have available is a fairly good way of nerfing rogues/warriors/mages through reverting their talent changes (and 1.8 hit). Unfortunately, under these constraints, we can't just "bring hunters in line" without nerfing the top dps classes.
---
My personal view is that constraining ourselves to balance in that way is stupid anyway because a lot of the changes we'd have to revert in order to nerf classes actually would hurt the usability of the classes. As such, we'd be better off looking to just straight up number changes, or to the proven solutions that the classic WoW class design team (i.e. Kevin Jordan) designed for classic but withheld implementing until the next expansion came out (which is to say, some TBC changes). But again, that's neither here nor there - I was just focusing on a way to achieve better balance while operating under the constraints of "was in some part of Vanilla WoW." 
---
The raids in vanilla are easy, get a good guild and clear 3-4 raids in 1 evening with 0 downtime 0 whipes.
---
The real tryhards will set up a macro to instantly login and reserve their name/multiple names but other than that it's just down to how fast you can type. 
---
There's either a few different POV or a number of different 40 druid Onyxia raids that were done if you search them on youtube. Here is one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzotezDdulQ
---
But let's be honest. No one is expecting a release on the 21th of june.
---
It sure can, but if you are just preBiS it can be pretty rough for more squishy classes like rogue.
---
Youd think that but you go in with the knowledge your character is getting deleted 2 or 3 weeks later so its like a sample of the game. This causes a lot of people to play another race/class and different zones. This ends up enroching your experience overall.
---
STOP TAKING THINGS SERIOUS ON THE INTERNET
---
There’s a private server called Hamberders?
---
Assuming Activision shareholders keep their greedy hands off Classic, it'll be a fun ride. Until that day comes, just treat Classic as something completely detached from the train wreck that is retail wow and to an extent the present day company philosophy.
---
No reason for them not to have  a classic real on their already existing Aussie servers.  No official word that I've heard but I think it's  a no brainer.  By the way, I think our relatively tiny oceanic community is going to be awesome. 
---
People should be spamming the global LFG channel instead, forming bonds with players they run into on their servers, and becoming a part of the server community and their guilds. Do that and finding groups is rarely an issue.
---
Damn, someone got a real big dose of sand in their vagina this morning. Hope you get it all out. 
---
Ah ok. Well... Basically the goal is to get a functioning reiteration of 1.12 as close as possible. There are still things left in the air (spell batching one of the largest). Until we have that set in stone (or close to it) nothing else should really be looked at.
---
From there, class balancing isn't necessary. 
---
i plan on leveling 2 chars simultaneously with this trick on a pvp server so that if i ever get camped i can go on the other char (obv prioritizing one but u know)
---
&gt;aquairred 
---
acquired?
---
It's not a non issue. If this is a non issue then it's all a non issue, it's all just about a video game. The damage text numbers being the same as they were in vanilla is just as important to the feel and gameplay of vanilla as the spell animations being the same, or the quest text font being the same. It might not be important to you personally. I get that. But to many people, they want to play classic and have it feel exactly like they're playing the game as it was. Damage text numbers are integral to that imo.
---
Yes, they were on US-Thrall for Naxxramas progression.
---
Perfect to listen to while at working. Hope you, Kargoz, Defcamp &amp; Melderon keep doing the talk / podcast videos. Great stuff!
---
LFG makes WoW feel like a *game*.  Building your own group makes WoW feel like a *world*.
---
When the game starts to do small things for you, the community starts to feel ***so*** much smaller and less important to the overall experience.
---
If you're not using that alt character anyway then I don't see there being any issue in logging them out in an inn while you level the main. Any extra XP is worth it IMO.
---
You will be able to play straight. They already said that you only need an active subscription to play.
---
Thank you 
---
That is true, and the difference for loot quests like the example you take is definitely not a lot for questing solo vs group. The problem is when you have to kill say the 12 Kobold Vermins, you're only going to kill the 12 and then the quest suddenly rewards a lot less xp in total solo compared to as a group.
---
You're gonna go through the quests a bit faster when you do them in a group, so you should definitely group up during launch. But keep in my mind that you will have to compensate the loss of xp later by grinding or doing dungeons (but only with the dungeon quests!).
---
My man!
---
I can like my Chia pet or pet rock too, doesn't make them any less useless.
---
It’s not below level 10 it makes no meaningful difference at low levels. The time it saves you at low levels is literally minutes, where as it’s hours at higher levels. So it’s worth it to spend extra time early on to grind the alt to over level ten immediately.
---
That's the outlook I feel most people have and I definitely understand it.
---
That is awesome of them. I look forward to seeing all the players in Classic in support of Blizzard.
---
Xroads got raided daily, sometimes hourly. 
---
Theyve pushed dates for lesser reasons
---
Why do so few know this date or believe it's true?
---
I'm not expecting it but, honestly, I would not be surprised at this point. Information seems to be coming fast and furiously now, earlier than I would have expected.
---
I still like the July 16th prediction, though
---
If black lotus spawns are going to be as they were in vanilla, it'll be much more expensive to maintain flasks, plus the way rallying cry of the Dragonslayer will differ will make the world buff/consumable meta much harder to maintain. So maybe we'll see actual progression happening instead of mat farming :D
---
Snap crackle pop.
---
Little did we know we'd end up as cereal...
---
I used to insist on June 16th to be the glory date. But I'm literally starting work next week and ending late August, so now I hope it's no sooner than August :(
---
Guess that's my confession bear meme right there. For a thing like Classic Launch, you simply gotta go big fucking dick no regrets no compromises all in balls deep pedal to the metal.
---
You can do 1 raid a week until AQ. At that point you probably want to do 2 raids a week. 
---
Even then you'd need to corpse run through Darkshore and Auberdine specifically, get the boat if that's even possible, then corpse run through the entirety of Darnassus and beyond.
---
If it's even possible, I wouldn't bother when you could just get a vulture in Mulgore. 
---
I had no idea. Thanks for this. I guess I'm headed to Valley of Trials tonight!
---
Will bind it to an emote macro
---
I can understand the sentiment, but as hard as naxx was if they nerf the top dpses by too much it almost wont be possible
---
As someone who's also maining a Warrior, my first alt is 100% going to be a Hunter or a Mage for farming purposes.
---
Classic summer (tm).  Release date winter.
---
Thanks for compiling this!
---
Can anyone comment how much luck I’d have as a pretty casual player on a warrior tank?  I love tanking but I’m worried about the time commitment for gearing.  I can play about 5 hours during the week and another 5-8 on the weekends.  Thanks!
---
Until now i had no idea there was a 21th of june
---
Horde has better access to leveling dungeons and really just better access to the whole map because of zeppelins.
---
I'm more disappointed in the fact that some pets are so bad compared to others, that you're kinda gimping yourself. I mean, cat has its purpose, boars have some advantages, but why do Tallstriders and Hyena's not have something similar enabling people to use their own preference. 
---
Leveling is dope but end game isn't great
---
I’ll take that a set further, if anyone autowhispers me with the help of some LFG addon bullshit they go on Ignore instantly, i’ve seen it on pservers and i always tell them to fuck off.
---
Just wondering, is Classic going to have straight Vanilla graphics? I thought it would have modern retail graphics. I understand the #nochanges but it makes sense to have a game that is optimized for a modern system. After all, I bought my 1080 for that sweet sweet WoW FPS /s
---
I swore of playing vanilla pservers due to this but i've been having fun on a paladin, just to test out the waters. My plan is just to get to 40 for a mount, and explore some questing areas i've otherwise never done as I was used to tbc rates and have felt stuck xp wise in a lot of zones.
---
Ah, so just a troll, got it, blocked so I don't have to deal with you again.
---
Ret rolls ret
---
During his 1.5 hour livestream the other day where he went through "reasons to play each class" he admits that he probably has the least amount of knowledge on the rogue class.
---
I think Kargoz has really good overview videos for each class, but like you said, most of them arent really 'guides'.
---
That's great to hear! I really hope we get together for another one soon! 
---
100% classic, Im just playing on a pserver to quelsh my vanilla thirst
---
Depending on the severity of business practices, sure. Very little in this world is black or white, it's up to the individual to decide their own choices on the matter and if it's worth it to them. It's also not always as simple as, "stop buying from company X," just use a different outlet if you can't do without.
---
Druids were amazing in TBC and Wrath, when you played them. Your impression of how fun a Vanilla druid will be is being greatly skewed by that experience. 
---
Unlike your experience, druids are an inferior class in Vanilla *after you reach the cap*. You can tank 5-mans and you can heal them, but (at 60) you will be inferior to warriors at tanking, other hybrids at healing, and non-hybrids at dps and CC. As a result, you will face some bias in 5-man pugs.
---
You will need to play a Vanilla druid because you like hybrid flexibility, not because of how well the class played in TBC.
---
Nah. It's your definition, again.
---
It's not because you are fine with that definition that others are / should be.
---
&gt;but as hard as naxx was if they nerf the top dpses by too much it almost wont be possible
---
On Nostalrius's successor server, 2 separate guilds cleared Naxxaramas within a few hours on opening day. And plenty of other guilds cleared it within the first reset. 
---
On the contrary it is more like Vanilla for Naxx to be "almost not possible." As such, nerfing the top DPSers is necessary for it to be a Vanilla experience, imo. 
---
Don't know about any limits but I could instantly recreate the character with the same name after deleting in the demo.
---
Thats a lot of words just to say sorcery.
---
&gt; Additionally, with very few exceptions, I find Horde Flight Paths much more convenient as well.
---
This is true and worth the price of admission alone.
---
Also, last time out I tried a Human Warlock because I wanted to play the game on hard mode, and lemme tell ya... no class trainers on all of Kalimdor was... trying to say the least. 
---
I missed having Zoram Strand FP, the far eastside Hinterlands FP... Fuck... just Camp Mojache alone is worth so much when you are farming Dire Maul, Thalanaar is sooo annoying to run from.
---
This is so true.  I was on a lower pop realm when the Dungeon Finder came out.  It was not at ALL uncommon to be the only, or one of just a few people in Hellfire Peninsula (one of the more populated leveling zones, tbh.  Everyone went there at 58, and often stayed for a while), even if you did a /who.  Even doing a /who for people near your level range while in vanilla zones often didnt send back many results, especially if you were a very late night player.
---
Its really unfortunate that the community took something that was actually pretty good when it first came out and bastardized it into what it is.  At first you still chatted with your group a bit when you got to the dungeon.  You still took pulls at the same speed you did before the DF.  Maybe as the run went on you'd pull a bit faster if the group could, but overall it was a good experience.
---
Compare that to leveling up my priest last weekend and its a completely different experience.  While it certainly didnt take the full 9 years to turn to shit, i swear its worse now than it even was in Cata/Pandaria, at least in the lower level dungeons.  People chainpulling constantly, paying not attention to the damage theyre taking, ignoring any kind of CC, not interrupting at all (had a tank in....AN or OK pull mobs with multiple of the shadowcasters that have a 5-6s cast that will do half their HP.  I managed to stun one of them as a priest once, CC'd another time, but others had the CC broken, couldnt stun, etc), etc.
---
Its really unfortunate.  The Dungeon Finder is a nice tool, especially for those of us on lower population realms.  Unfortunately the 'gogogo' attitude of retail players has made it a pretty frustrating experience.
---
Obviously all that being said applies to retail, and it has no place in Classic.  
---
You log in faster then the other guy. That's it.
---
Not a lot of people know this tbh.
---
/who (level), start whispering, make FRIENDS. 
---
Thats what I'm saying,  dude is acting like retail players are all horrible and toxic, like, plenty of players back then were just as bad.  Being a dick transcends labels like Retail and Vanilla.
---
Did he not see the “you think you you do but you don’t” videos? What an irrelevant disgusting slob. He couldn’t be more wrong. Classic is going to be HUGE. Like way bigger than anyone thought it’s going to be. There is a gigantic fucking void in the west for an MMO right now.
---
I got a lot of things that weren’t as much on my radar to think about from this question.  Realm pop is bigger than I was thinking, having not played private servers I wasn’t thinking of this issue as much as you all that have are.
---
I don’t have a guild or a group of people scouting out where we want to play so the realm list was also not on my radar.
---
This was an informative thread for me, so thanks everyone.
---
Rogue/Druid combo is kinda fun.  Get a stealth kitty to help you out then stun lock like crazy. 
---
I've leveled as both factions and I feel with Horde you can do a lot more quests simultaneously in the lower end zones. For example you could do the Crossroads and Ratchet at the same time without really skipping a beat, but with Alliance you need to run Westfall/Redridge, which is much more difficult from a travel standpoint. Overall I enjoy the Horde leveling experience more, mainly due to how efficient it is to level.
---
No. Looking for group was the primary thing that killed the WoW realm community stone dead.
---
People simply won't interact with strangers if there's no reason to - which LFG incentivises by being easier than advertising in global channels etc - and I get enough of the massively single player role playing game experience from retail.
---
Can confirm this is how I found the sub and remembered WoW Classic. 
---
Like /u/lolzexd said, plainstrider, coyotes, wind serpents - but I also think Eagles or Hawks would suit them. I remember a starting quest in Cataclysm making you fly across from the level 1 zone, to Bloodhoof Village.
---
Damn, this makes me want to go Tauren Hunter..
---
I know right, what a dumbass. It's 21sth not 21th.
---
Also as Alliance, making the run to Stonetalon Peak on a PvP server... forget about it. You need stealth or it is an absolute nightmare. 
---
For some buffs such as the tank or caster flasks, it's worth taking the time to farm them from a gear/stats standpoint. The Supreme Power flask, for example, is essentially like doubling the offensive stats from the entirety of their gear. That's like bringing two people for the price of one raid spot. It will help you blast through bosses that much faster, and essentially help to gear your entire raid.
---
Or you can spend that time wiping on the boss. 
---
Your choice.
---
Consistent dmg is bad in pvp.  Burst dmg is good.  So shockadins are good.
---
I am nothing if not generous in my made up fantasy.
---
Can I come over ?  :p deep dish is the best.
---
If classic could sustain just over a million year around I think it'd be a massive success.
---
Late reply, had a long weekend.
---
&gt;Coding a few mobs is not the hardest thing in the world. People have been doing it on private servers for free for years with very satisfying results. 
---
Doing a one off is very easy, it gets actually difficult when you have to make sizeable old changes to an new engine while trying to get it running at scale. BTW its not just "coding a few mobs" its their patrols, their stats and abilities, and reverting the map to 1.5 as well. 
---
&gt;Would you pay a guy to paint your house and somehow being okay them leaving one wall untouched?
---
If I hired a guy to paint my house and he said he was going to start with an eggshell white as a base and then I get mad at him because after I told him I wanted one room to be green, would be my own fault. He told me everything was going to be eggshell white and I agreed, I shouldn't be surprised that one room was the same colour....
---
&gt;You speak as if you understand the issue but you only see your side of the story.
---
No I speak for the people who could read and temper their expectations. 
---
&gt;You don't give a shit about it obvious and you can't respect the fact that it mattered for other people and that it could matter in the future. You project all that shit into me when really you're just a self centered individual who can't take one for the team. 
---
This is why I said you're emotional, I have said nothing against or for AV yet here you are attacking me.  I have no opinion on AV because I disliked it either way, it was very little PvP/skill no matter the version, but I understood from the multiple times blizzard has said they're using 1.12.1. I'm talking purely on the point that this was obvious.
---
 You also talk like everyone agree's with your opinion which is not even close to true.
---
I'm fine if you want 1.5, it doesn't bother me at all but what does bother me however is people getting mad when they've obviously said it wasn't going to happen. 
---
&gt;"Yeah it's fine because reasons and you can't say otherwise because of your delusions and nostalgia and lack of respect for devs."
---
Yes you have a lack of respect for the developers by saying its an easy job when you have NO IDEA what goes into it.
---
&gt;Completely denying the certainty that it's going to be toxic for everyone as long as it satisfies your own need to see this unaltered but somehow I'm the guy with agenda. 
---
Here you are talking like everyone agrees with you again, you understand why I said you had an emotional bias right? 
---
All I said was you were being emotional instead of rational when the obvious was announced. If you actually thought blizzard was going to create 1.5 AV when they've stated over and over 1.12.1 is the base because its something they can accurately recreate then that's your own fault for getting your hopes up to a delusion.
---
That's kinda what I meant. :-)
---
I've heard about 25-man Druid raid groups. I'm sure this has been done with other classes. Never heard of a 40-person raid.
---
Yeah it is a quality of life improvement. No one is debating that. Someone giving me 1,000g would also improve my quality of life, but it wouldn’t make the game more fun. 
---
I've been thinking of putting together a noob-friendly lore guide, that introduces players to all the races and classes from the perspective of lore rather than gameplay. Maybe I should get on to that (need to play Warcraft III first though).
---
I cry everyday, I cry more then any of you. I cry when I start the video I cry when it ends, I cry when I read your comments I cry when someone tells me I think something and then am told I do not.. its just to fricken hard :'(
---
Thats really not how ranking works, at all.
---
Yes. However original vanilla wow was only capped by hardware limitations. If they went the same and made cap as large as hardware would allow, there would be 1 massive server. There are two possible correct authentic answers. 
---
Totally agree. I just hope Activision Blizzard knows to leave well enough alone. 
---
I don't think a lot of people realize this was a thing. I also don't think 90% of the people saying Druids suck in PVP likely tried to PVP in strictly cat form, which is not what makes Druids strong.
---
Okay so what's the difference between rage generation on private servers and the official classic server?
---
Let me guess... you don't know.
---
I think until we know the exact stats and whatnot I think calling for nerfs based on private server data is a very flawed system. Not to say pserver data is useless, but it's also not accurate enough to warrant any sort of major changes until we know just how big the difference is.
---
Ah I'm so dumb!
---
https://itemization.info
---
Very well done! Thanks a lot for your work.
---
also blizzard hands out all previous expansions everytime a new one comes around, your account shoud atleast be viable to play Legion
---
its especially hard when you have a timer showing almost to a point when the fear is going to occur. oh, so difficult!
---
why did my tanks suck
---
RP-PvP servers at launch.
---
I’m curious what names other than rude language are filtered out by the modern client. Are there any?  
---
Ok, this is hillarious, here's a pretty funny guide how Horde players can get an Owl pet. It does require dying.
---
http://deathraygames.com/articles/walkthroughs/wow-horde-owl/
---
I cry everyday, I cry more then any of you. I cry when I the video starts, I cry when it ends, I cry when I read your comments, I cry when someone tells me I think something and then am told I do not..
---
Sheesh, someones played enhancement and were completely garbage at it.
---
I’m hoping so, as June 21st is my birthday and what an amazing gift that would be.
---
make a dwarven warrior and name it legolas
---
But other macros did.
---
You ever buy anything from Amazon? Apple? Wal-Mart? Coca Cola? Nestle? 
---
It's fun in it's own way.
---
Gameplay wise, it can be boring: I found myself spamming Flash of Light the majority of the time, but in case of emergency I did Divine Favor for a free and instant max rank Holy light, in combination with Holyshock. 
---
However, all healers perform great even with their weaknesses, in this version of the game. 
---
It's fun being able to save people's butts with Hand of Freedom, or make their 1v1 against a Horde player suddenly stupidly in their favor with Hand of Protection. Of course that's against physical damage dealers. 
---
But hey, it's always awesome having a Holy Paladin that knows what he's doing, helping you.
---
Levelling is simple, probably the slowest, but not a bumpy road. You're not going to die, but you're not going to kill things very fast, at least not until you decide to try Protection levelling when you reach 41 for the talent Holy Shield, allowing you to AOE mobs instead of single target.
---
Yes, you're the only one.
---
If your position is that blizzard should make balance changes once they have good data that shows game and class imbalance, then I'm definitely on board with that. 
---
Maybe I was never a big player, I just happened to PvP a lot while levelling so I ran into all the people who would later grind to warlord/high warlord and so made a name as some one you could fill a spot with. 
---
Same with gnome's expansive mind. 5% of say 300 int is 15 int. That is just flat out not even close to enough to justify rolling a race you don't want to play.
---
1: That doesn't change the fact that the 1.12 cap is a known working formula.
---
2: At least one dev has said the old cap was a design decision not a hardware limitation. 
---
*Dr Evil voice*
---
Riiiiiiiiiiggghhhhhtttttttt.... 
---
It's worth it to get an alt to level 35 so you can have an alchemist (and enchanter for DE), but unlike in retail, it's not worth it to get to 60 for gathering professions as there's also an added cost of needing an epic mount to gather effectively. So not only do you need to spend a few hundred hours getting to 60, but you also need to spend more than a thousand gold before you can effectively farm.
---
Well my friend, you totally miss the point on what classic wow should be about and you won't have fun. Save some time/pain and don't even try it.
---
Sorry if it's sound hard but i'm really helping you there. :)
---
Good luck taming one of those damn swoops!
---
You will be met with resistance. 
---
I'll be massively disappointed, but I will most likely keep playing.
---
My daddy always told me everything before a but is said to have no meaning at all. So, what you are saying is you aren’t hyped and you will not play if it has  sharding 👌🏻
---
False. The end game is even better than leveling. Being a healer in high end raids and then throwing on my rag tag feral gear and heading into the world to farm and PvP was a blast. There’s a reason I’m maining Druid forever, it’s so varied.
---
Also, seal form is tight.
---
Weather xrealm grouping is a thing and if so, can us in OCE group with friends in US
---
Absolutely right my man. Sometimes they were even worse than current wow. 
---
Eagles and hawks are not tameable in Vanilla.
---
Assuming 200 hours to level a mage. At 30g/hour you could make 6000 gold on your warrior. If you have a healer duo when DM is out you can do jump runs for 40-60g/h.
---
Level an alt because it is something you are interested in playing, or because you enjoy leveling.
---
The Rake
---
Also, the braid/pigtails/whichever hairstyle it is that gives you *literally the best casting animation in the game.*
---
Sure, you'll only see it when you're channeling your hearth, but I promise it'll be worth it.
---
Please stop it with this.  Virtually nobody wants sharding, and absolutely everyone understands why that is.  If there is sharding at release for the first few weeks (as previously promised), just skip the first few weeks.  
---
You must be a masochist if you plan to level two characters to 15 in the first two days of launch.
---
Please go complain about modern WoW on r/wow, not on r/classicwow. If you want to make a discussion about comparing the two, that's great, but memes purely focused on shitting on modern WoW (and, rightfully so IMO) aren't relevant.
---
Blah I know everything about my class for vanilla  - blood death knight tanks all the way 
---
The tank knowing what they’re doing IS an issue as far as you soliciting their services versus them signing up knowing darn well what’s expected of them, but that’s an aside.  
---
No one talking is less a symptom of group finder and more an issue with dungeons being turned in to loot halls circa BC and casualized in WotLK.  There’s just not much to be said when there is no question of navigation or strategy.  
---
It’s not like group finder wasn’t server specific in the beginning anyway.  It was made battle group specific when people still wanted more people in the pool.  After the initial gearing up for raids, there isn’t much incentive to run dungeons, and that’s not going to change in Vanilla.  Long term, the lobby-fication of the game did a lot of damage, but it’s more a symptom of how server populations are managed rather than a conscious decision to make the game worse.  They had been trying to create a queue system for dungeons groups since Vanilla.  It just didn’t take off until WotLK when the UI got better.  
---
I see it as an easy cash grab for blizzard. Until they confirm or deny it I’m inclined to believe it’ll be like retail.
---
Yes, you’re the only one. Long live sharding for vanilla at release.
---
I mean, both can be hard.
---
I'm planning to resub up to a month before so that I can log in and make sure all of my addons and stuff are up to date and setup the way I like...just in case most or all of them work for Classic since it's running on the same current retail hardware/core.
---
I'll probably make a fresh character and setup addons and stuff.  Then when Classic launches, I can make my new character and copy the profile over and BAM! done
---
I’m a huge advocate for sharding at launch
---
How are paladins for the 5man tanking ranking?
---
The classic forums don’t require a sub. 
---
Good range for professions, too, since you need 10 to get to 150 if you plan on passing them mats.
---
Finally a vanilla screenshot of a competent player who wasn’t a clicker; look at these fucking non default binds, this man was AotC
---
Naw man, it'll be on the 21rd of June.
---
My very first character ended in the low 30s somewhere in Desolace.
---
When I started playing, it was with a group of friends who had all been playing since the game had launched.  They wanted to roll on a fresh server in anticipation of TBC, so I started leveling my very first Undead Rogue on Exodar US-E, PvE server.  After some time playing there, they started to miss their home server, Burning Blade US-E, PvP.  So we went back and I rerolled another Undead Rogue, feeling like I was losing **so** much progress.
---
?
---
I watched this video yesterday the first time. 
---
And anyways, is it bad to spread some HYPE? 
---
Wind Serpents are found in Thousand Needles, where the Tauren maintain a presence.
---
How does that work with a Hunter though? It's the class I have no clue about, but I'm curious in that Class as a farm twink later on.
---
Does your Pet become "unhappy" if you are not online with your twink or how does that work?
---
*By the light of ELUUUUNE!!?*
---
I think you meant rp on one of those... but you don’t need to distinguish between rp and rp-pvp because rp is rp-pve whether or not the pve is added. 
---
I feel like at 21 I am too young to relate to your guys posts...and yet my knees hurt every goddamn day!
---
You might already know this, but Keydar is still very active and regularly posts new strips every week. I’m hoping to see him do some Classic-related strips this summer.
---
Keydar’s the only one still around, though. The rest of Dark Legacy is long gone, with the last one to quit being Miji who I believe quit some time in MoP. But Keydar still does casual endgame stuff to this day.
---
they also said " soon, not soon (tm)"
---
Pretty sure it is currently 2 weeks, long idea how long it’s been like that
---
If I log into the WoW app on my phone I can see the list of all of my characters and some of them have weird letters at the end of their names now because they need name changes, but if I try to actually look at one of them it tells me that I can't see it on a trial account.  And I can't see anything about them from a computer...just on my iphone WOW app.
---
Horde, as you get to contribute to the degenerative society that is barrens chat.
---
It will be the vanilla game running on top of a modern client, so I's expect something similar to retail.
---
Warriors can't heal or stealth for shit.
---
Oh you mean like how Xroads flight master was camped and constantly under attack? Which still happens on pservers?
---
Its a faction war. Come camp my flight masters Ally scum.
---
Yes, when the day of release finally comes you won't be seeing people whining and boycotting because sharding. You will see people happily wandering in the old Azeroth once more. People will feel whole again. 
---
I think on rp-pvp servers you have to use the rp naming rules.
---
Probably because you sit too much each day. Gotta start stretching and exercising. 
---
The only time you'd be picked last for not playing a dwarf would be if you're trying to get into a super hardcore guild intent on racing for world/server first accomplishments.
---
Mechanically speaking, as long as the necessary roles are filled race is irrelevant. You could have a group in which every tank is a gnome and every priest a night elf and, provided everyone is organized and competent (which is what really matters), you'll get through just fine.
---
Well with sharding “shudder” it should be pretty easy. And yes, I am crazy enough to level two characters like that at the beginning. 
---
I'm not defining "combat".  I am describing the flagged [combat] state and talking about what can and cannot be used when said condition is met.  I don't care what pop-culture expansion of "PvP combat" entails that happens outside being flagged in [combat].  Nothing I've said has been in relation to anything other than when the server thinks you are in active [combat] vs not.  Do you not get that?
---
Not with sharding. 
---
You’re totally right, I misremembered since it was a long time ago. 
---
... Everything. 
---
How am I missing it if I played it before XD ? What you wrote doesn't make any sense, I already know what the game is gonna be, and I can tell you that in the years wow introduced some good things and it would be awesome to see them integrated in what I consider the best iteration of the game which is vanilla. When the nostalgia factor finally fades, people are gonna quickly realize what an incredible missed opportunity this was to start from scratch and build the perfect game. The whole #nochanges bullshit is coming from people who never played vanilla and want to pretend they can go back in time and I guarantee you, mark my words, that these people will be the first to complain about drop rates, spawn rates, class imbalances, etc. etc. etc. it's gonna be hilarious.
---
Ahh that makes sense. I couldn’t remember exactly. Thank you!
---
Don't buy all abilities from the trainer, only the ones you need. Spend as little on the AH as possible. Take two gathering professions and sell the stuff you gather. Don't forget about grey &amp; white drops from the mobs you kill, they can be vendored for decent silver in some cases. 
---
It all adds up.
---
Because vanilla is an incomplete game. TBC is what vanilla should have been.
---
Ahh ok I remembered incorrectly, it’s been so long. Thank you for clearing that up.
---
Hah
---
I'm not against changes down the line, but I definitely think overbalancing is a real concern especially considering the state the game is in retail, and that hybrid tax needs to be upheld to an extent.
---
Oh right, I was legit curious. I've not played pservers in years.
---
I personally like alliance leveling more due to the different level zones. The barrens just last too long for me 
---
Commenting to save this for later. Great work!
---
I get that, but for me, the length of an encounter doesn't mean necessarily easy or hard.
---
I play some games on the highest difficulty and it's still easy, just because I KNOW the encounter and the length doesn't matter.
---
For me it's artificially harder. Personally I feel, without new and more challenging Boss mechanics, the Bosses just takes longer. That's all.
---
I mean even more Damage doesn't make most games more difficult, it's just means you better Dodge.
---
I just join the Horde, that makes everything difficult enough, without the Alliance cheese mode. Not because I make it artificially longer, it's just because some key abilities are missing on that faction. This makes raids more creative, because they have to adapt.
---
You know? Or did you feel like Horde was already too easy for you and you want it even harder?
---
I know, i was just replying to the post.
---
Do we need this comment every time private servers are mentioned. No shit things are going to be different. But a whole bunch of stuff is gonna be exactly the same. Learn what you can from what we have to work with. Adjust as we learn what's different.
---
Wow, thats a lot of links! thanks so much
---
Don't beat yourself up, I've made the same mistake myself many times before.
---
I won't even spend much energy to explain how the lfg system destroyed the community, it's good sense and there's plenty of evidence/explanation from experienced vanilla players. 
---
21std'verd of June'st confirmed
---
Going from private servers where Black Lotus spawns are dynamic and VERY frequent to Classic where they are going to be MANY hours will severely limit the number of Flasks available.
---
Going from private servers where you can pretty much chain turn-in world buffs to Classic where Onyxia's head can only be turned in 2 or 3 times a day (I think?) will also be a rude awakening for some.
---
What are you even talking about? What killed wow community was server sharding and cross realm bullshit. You used to see and know everyone on your server and now you can't even see your guild mates in org. Plain and simple. LFG is just an interface tool which says "I'm looking for X players to farm Y spot" [this](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/733310.jpg), if I wasn't clear enough.
---
Yah he could run down epic mounts.
---
Ah, oldschool EQ guys, that explains their world first kills on Razor &amp; Vael.  
---
What happened with Naxx? How come you guys never finished? Guild break up for a time at the end of Vanilla or something?
---
Not gonna' lie, this ranks way higher on my list of reasons to be excited about Classic than it probably ought to, strictly speaking.
---
It's also why I'm terrified of Blizz listening to the BC fans and once again releasing the plague of pointy ears^1 on the Horde somewhere down the line.
---
I'd rather they bring the goblins in again. Or the taunka, but I'm *ever so slightly* biased there.
---
GLORIOUS BOVINE MASTER RACE!
---
^1 ^Trolls ^don't ^count; ^the ^tusks ^cancel ^out ^the ^ears.
---
I think it’s generally accepted that quiver won’t work in classic. It’s a private server quirk.
---
&gt;Nothing I've said has been in relation to anything other than when the server thinks you are in active [combat] vs not. Do you not get that? 
---
This is the entirety of your original comment
---
&gt; Humans have weapon skill, which boosts dps. Stealth is not a combat ability.
---
Note that there is nothing in that sentence about servers, the "[combat]" state, or even about being flagged in combat.. You seemingly used the term colloquially. At that point in time, you were speaking like a normal human being so I responded conversationally, as if I were indeed speaking to a normal human being instead of a closet pedant waiting to pounce. Clearly that was a mistake on my part.
---
Happy cake day! I don't think i'd play beta at this point either unless to relieve some of the server congestion at launch day they allowed beta participants to keep their progress. 
---
So blizzard... Make a beta, for those who bought tickets / virtual tickets to blizzcon, let us keep our progress and get this show on the road!
---
I'm playing on Pservers right now just doing 1-10 trial runs and may move to 10-20 runs to see how fast I can get it done. Finding optimal paths =D
---
July 2nd. Early enough in the summer to still be a "Classic Summer", and it's a Tuesday.
---
What sorcery is this 👀
---
This was blizzard’s fault, because they recommended RP servers to a lot of new players.
---
&gt; Case in point: greater protection potions
---
Terrible example to make your point - why else would Blizz put greater nature protection pots in the game, because of all those Moonkins running round spamming Wrath at you?
---
I think protection pots, resist gear, buff food are all perfectly legit to require.  As are flasks.
---
Probably extreme examples of consumables would be the Ungoro crystal buffs and Juju stuff.
---
I've heard from "A friend of a friend" that says there are 12 servers already operational. 
---
The ghost cat from Darkshore. 
---
because lots of people have evolved and only produce endorphins from being better than other people
---
It's not pure nostalgia or people who have never played vanilla driving this. If I want, I can go play vanilla wow *today*. Those who want it have been able to play vanilla wow for years and years, warts and all - a fact people tend to forget when they bring out the usual tired critiques of nostalgia goggles etc - and I can tell you even with it's flaws it is a vastly superior product to retail wow. On private servers the old wow community is as alive as it ever was during Vanilla &amp; TBC in contrast to retail. The reason for that? No LFG.
---
It's a roleplay server where PVP is activated. What is there not to understand?
---
Simple things can help a lot.  Keeping all the food and mana drinks that drop off mobs.  Killing everything in your path to, and from quests.  Stacking spirit(yep, even as melee) to reduce downtime.  Stopping every couple levels to grind out easy, quick-turnover mobs for 1/4 - 1/2 a level, to keep yourself of the XP curve and to prevent quest droughts.  Don't return to your capital city every 2 levels to train, push it to 4 or 6, not having a max rank skill for a couple levels won't slow you down.  However, it's a safe bet to stop at a capital every 0 level (10,20,30,etc) as these are when you usually get really significant abilities, and are also usually when class quests become available.
---
It wasn't just one thing that killed WoW.
---
Classic is my contraception. 
---
Depends on game designer's decisions this time. The foridden launch of second client is not too hard to implement.
---
Man does that sound cozy af
---
Miss this guy :')
---
Oh yeah, high lag and disconnection are a priority for a true vanilla experience!
---
&gt;let us keep our progress and get this show on the road!
---
Keep progress from the beta into launch you mean? How about no...
---
You don't lose flask on death. Unless you are thinking of very early vanilla.
---
I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I am going to be very critical of anything that isn't classic.
---
Lore-wise, orc warlocks should be hunted down and summarily executed as a matter of principle, *especially* by the Horde. The whole point of Thrall's Horde is getting away from the sins and corruption of their past; the fact they have a base *in Orgrimmar* has always been a pretty glaring contradiction.
---
Not that I'm complaining or saying anyone who enjoys playing them is wrong in any way, of course, I'm just nerding out because it's fun. I fully intend to play a 'lock myself, though it'll be Alliance-side, and I've yet to decide between human or gnome.
---
The death of the community started long, *long* before the introduction of sharding and cross realm. People have been complaining about it for so long I'm surprised you could even think that. As someone who was around and played religiously at the time I can tell you it was LFG that started it.
---
Or standing for too long, factory worker also knee pain and crackling please send promotion. 
---
Not legion (only demo) but "current" and it will read current-alike database containing data converted from old to current database format.
---
Rogue is a lot tbh. T1 it's not all of it, but T2 as sword you want 8/8, 5/8 as dagger, and you use T2.5 and T3 too.
---
But yeah rest is correct :)
---
&gt; You can do strat live with starter gear with people you 100% trust in 17-20minutes per run.
---
wat?
---
Role-playing a human paladin who can't kill an undead even if he wants to? Kind of silly, imo.   
---
Roleplaying and PVP roleplaying are two completely different things; one is a matter of your character's socialization, and the other is about 'killing the villain' or 'fighting for a better world.'  
---
I never RP'd hardcore, but world PvP raids would often have players yelling "FOR THE LIGHT!" or "FOR THE HORDE!" as they charged at South Shore. 
---
RPing is living in the world as your character....and the fact that this game is called "World of WARcraft" tells me that PvP is or should be a big part of that. 
---
That said, to each their own; it makes 100% sense to me.  I'm not saying PvE RP isn't 'real RP' by any means. 
---
&gt;Tauren Shaman
---
You dropped this.
---
Bring your laptop, charger cable, and a mouse.
---
“Ah, a chest pain. Is this the one?” -Me, monthly 
---
My first character ended at level 3. Taurens weren't my cup'o tea, and I went on to make a gnome warlock. :D
---
"stealth is not a combat ability" is exactly the same statement I've been making the entire time.  When I wrote that I didn't think I had to define [combat] vs ongoing struggle against another player that may or may not involve dropping and resuming a [combat] state several times.  Should I go back and edit that so it's wholly consistent with how I've learned you don't use the same words the same way I do?  Because I sure as shit will not make this mistake again and assume we all use a standardized meaning and knew how to parse these words the same way.  
---
People have fun in different ways
---
There just wasn't enough time before it was made irrelevant with the Burning Crusade expansion.  I imagine some were getting less enthusiastic as holidays approached and even more the closer TBC got.
---
Here's another thought, how about everyone focuses on enjoying whatever they find enjoyable?
---
It might have been recorded sometime in 2017, before Blizzard announced development for classic. Before that announcement, the community was mostly on the "no classic" side because nobody believed they would actually listen to the vanilla community.
---
Wait, /sit to trigger crits is p-server thing? I distinctly remember people saying that if you sit, you will be crit when I played 1.12 Vanilla. On top of that - there’s that pally that one shot Kazzak in early Vanilla because he stacked a shitload of reckoning when it didn’t have a limit - it’s not inconceivable that he did it without /sit to trigger crits, but it would take him so, SO long to do that without /sit.
---
Some people have fun by playing optimally. This sub doesn't really understand that, though. Most of the people here think you can only enjoy yourself if you're deliberately slow and lack game knowledge.
---
I belive I remember them saying if they had a beta it would be a short beta. So I think this would be a good solution for over crowding / over populated areas.  
---
Also gives incentive for people to actually play a beta. Instead of saying ill just wait 3 weeks so I'm not wasting my time. 
---
Never, at least not in quantifiable terms. Can you imagine the backlash from older low-pop realms when they found out they were at 20% capacity? 
---
Conspiracy theories.
---
Are there any competing games coming out this Summer? That's when Blizzard will release it.
---
I don't see the point of rolling a Shaman alt if you are dead set on playing Alliance on your main and I highly recommend playing a Mage, since warriors have limited gold generation outside of tanking 5mans. Also enh Shamans aren't really doing that much damage on average, they are more of a melee support spec.
---
Mage farming is very-gear independand and very fast. Hunter farming is more tricky and a bit more gear dependand since you'll be soloing dungeons like Mara, but can net similar results if you have the right professions (like engineering/alchemy + herbalism).
---
My first character ended up with over 300 days played from vanilla through wotlk. Rip life.
---
Because you might still find RP on PVP servers, but you can't wPVP on RP servers. Well, you can, if and only if they're flagged.
---
Closed beta in September at this rate
---
Do we have to be Team Friends vs Team Min-Max all the time?
---
I agree with this, 100%. But I also feel like you get a much better feeling of being on an adventure as an alliance. 
---
Mages and warriors are closed for now. Still looking for all other classes.
---
As Alliance u struggle just a bit more when levelling and u are god mode at end game (Paladins, Dwarf Priests, Human Weapon Skills ecc.)
---
As Horde u have easier time levelling and u struggle more end game in raids. 
---
It stands to you deciding what you value more.
---
The short answer is, no
---
The long answer is, no its not
---
It's more that I don't understand what you lose by rolling on a regular RP server given no RP-PVP. 
---
As I think about it more, I believe that RP and PVP are nearly antithetical to one another. How can you RP when you're smashing your ability buttons trying to beat on someone? Controlled PVP events on an RP server seem more satisfying, sort of like how I imagine LARP people or Civil War reenactors do their thing. If instead these people were told - "Ok meet up in the field and actually try to beat up your opponents", the whole idea of their theme and setting would likely fly out the window. I'm not sure that I'd ever be good at LARPing in any form but I KNOW I'd suck if I was trying to beat up some other guy in an actual fight.
---
That's what I'm trying to figure out here: Which side of RP-PVP is more attractive to the (understandably) vocal crowd that's appeared.
---
Pay a team of people in China to PVP for you 24/7? That's what peeps did in Vanilla.
---
Burning Blade? Lol no way, that’s where I leveled my first low level 30 toon. It was a human pally. I probably tried to use exorcism on you at one point and got upset cause it didn’t work on players... lol. And I got too scare to level in STV. So I made alts until the end of vanilla. Time to redeem myself.
---
Horde have it abit easier but alliance is more fun. 
---
Because I played the journey 14 years ago and have played private server end game for the last 5 years. 
---
Myfirst char ended at lvl 9, troll hunter
---
As someone who wants to play both a shaman and a pally + others, I can understand him. The point is that it’s a lot of fun and do whatever makes you have fun playing. 
---
And on the note of enhancement, it’s support for melee in PvE, however it’s one of the most fun PvP specs out there imo. Got mine up to rank 12 before the honor change. 
---
The question is just what you want more, roleplay or PVP.
---
Do you want to roleplay with worse pvp, or pvp with worse roleplay.
---
I'm basically planning to do this. Just gonna make a raid guild that gets drunk 2 nights a week and slams our faces against the keyboard.. no requirements to raid except show up and be level 60. 
---
Why do a quest-chain when you can AFK in LFR for better loot anyway?   
---
Oh, now I'm sad...
---
so many useful link, after years of shaman main, this old dog learned new tricks  
---
Thanks for the compilation OP  
---
\[F\]
---
Sounds like a personal issue. :V
---
lol nerd
---
Typical boomer
---
Yeah, I can't believe people played as long as they did. I was done after a year.
---
I plan to do both. Sure, the former won't scratch my reflexive contrarian itch (except for the fact I intend to spec arcane), but I plan first thing to take him across the world and level in Kalimdor. Because I'm a lore/RP nerd.
---
Yeah I'm talking about early vanilla, they didn't change the flasks until patch 1.7 (ZG).
---
Ugh I hate that I have to essentially go through my history every single time and copy paste the same damn link to the evidence. This shit should be stickied.
---
I’m on my phone but it’s a 100% fact (blue posts from 2006) that /sit macros were patched before 1.12 to not trigger rage generation or ability charges from crits. 
---
Mostly due to coordination.  It's much easier to have 40 people work independently for 3 hours than get 40 people to work together for 3 hours.
---
Plaintriders are a great choice alongside wind serpents and swoops. I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a Tauren with one of the lions from the barrens.
---
Hahaha, I love this comment. 
---
Aka just got 60 (starter gear not preBiS or raid gear) and nuke the place by using CC and AoE in a controlled manner. A 5men group in discord doing strat:live solely for gold farming.
---
Right!? God it'd be amazing.

Yes it will. That was confirmed at Blizzcon.

Double the DPS? I don't consider it feasible to play two characters at once, skills and all.

Ah, fair enough. Thanks for the correction.

Comments have been really interesting, but I feel many people are being short sighted. 3 years is a very long time in gaming now a days. The possibility of classic retaining even 30% of its initial player base in that time is probably 0. 
---
If your intention is to play vanilla solo on dead servers in 3 years then I guess it makes sense to not do periodic wipes. However, if you wish to give people reasons to want to reroll and revisit content TOGETHER, then the only option is either rereleasing other expansions or ‘seasons’ as they are being called. 
---
Not sure if you looked at the numbers in the screenshot. Guy on the left has vastly less kills than player on the right, like 90% less or some shit. Yet he still has more honor gains. He simply killed the leaders of horde city’s like thrall and blood hoof while 40 alliance in a separate raid did all the work. Pretty smart way to farm honor honestly
---
I started in June of 09.  I had actually forgotten until recently that my first character was actually a mage.  It got left somewhere between 10 and 20, and i made a warlock.  They were both actually gnomes.
---
Ive been on....at least 5 different servers over the last 9 3/4 years, but im actually back on the original one now, and that mage has been leveled to 120.  My main is still a warlock (3rd different one from switching servers), but ive leveled up multiples of my told toons on that server.  Ive actually been playing my priest quite a bit lately, which got to 62ish in Wrath and then was my bank bitch for a long time.  Finally leveled it up sometime in Legion iirc.
---
/sit to trigger crits is a thing, proccing talents from it isn't.
---
#nochanges
---
I just tried again. Staying on the road allowed me to reach the Furlborgs tunnel with about a dozen corpse run, not too bad. However the tunnel is too camped, once I rezz I'm immediately killed.
---
A little of pservers, especially a TBC one since things are a little different so it's not exactly the same as what I'll experience in Classic. Mostly YouTube videos and talking about it with my IRL friends on discord. Definitely in that place of intentionally trying to not burn myself out beforehand or otherwise ruin it.
---
The wait is brutal. 
---
Might as well play retail since it’s so easy to reach max level /s 
---
Probably not the best but something we did on a very crowded private server, and that worked much better than people would think was having a group of 4 people. 1 tank, 1 healer, 2 dps and level to 15 then just spam dungeons over and over (and doing every q available for that dungeon). We occasionally did some group quests in the open world which we felt gave alot of exp. An example would be the Arathi highlands elite quests. Took us 9 days played to hit 60 and we were really geared when we got there, already had like 50% of our preraid bis gear. 
---
Some absolute horrid rogue guides right there (understandable though with automod block), even messing up the pre-raid and BIS lists. Go for Oto's rogue guide (1m+ views), understanding the rogue class - soyoen's way (200k+ views), RogueDPS Reborn spreadsheet (20k+ unique downloads), and Youfie's Combat Dagger spreadsheet (10k+ downloads) - you will honestly not need anything past that, ever.
---
I was waiting for people to get salty about this... I didn't get disappointed :).
---
He says 'No one goes home until we are done**!**'. You sounded like he asked a question, instead of making a statement.
---
This is actually amazing? Found a new favourite channel. o\_o
---
&gt;Anyone else out there possibly passing on Classic for one reason or another?
---
I do worry that I might not be able to play it in enough moderation for it to not affect my last year of grad school. 
---
Prioritizing rage generation makes sense only in the context of a raid stacked with big dick DPS that can take advantage of the higher threat ceiling. 
---
I feel like this guidance mostly applies if you're going for speed runs in farm content or if you have the luxury of stacking a raid comp with classes who are naturally high threat (warlocks, fury warriors) or who can trade threat reduction for more DPS (rogues, hunters).
---
I think the OP is trying to remind people that there is no rush to the endgame in vanilla. 
---
Most of the Youtube content is so focused to rush, minmax and own the game that it feels like you are required to do so by default. 
---
Play as you feel fit for you and hopefully have fun.
---
Lmfao the part with the mining dwarf...
---
Urg, you're making me regret not having access to my vanilla pics.... 
---
I waffled back and forth on this for a while, but finally settled on undead because I love the character concept I came up with.
---
Leaving aside strategic considerations, the whole reason Thrall admitted the Forsaken to the Horde was because Cairne made him see the tragedy of their existence and convinced him allying with them might offer them a path to salvation (of a sort).
---
Bearing that in mind, my mage is going to be a Forsaken who, well, forsakes Lordaeron for Kalimdor, both to repay the kindness Thrall and the Horde have shown by taking his people in and to try to find some measure of peace with his new life among their number.
---
My first character was a Gnome Warlock named Voidmoon. I was pretty young and had no idea what I was doing. Played roughly 6 hours straight and hit level 10. My PC died that day. Roll around December and receive a new PC to play Vanilla on. Mom thought it looked fun so she picked up her own copy. Started a troll hunter and got him to level 31 in a couple of weeks. Ended up making a druid because one of my friends from Starcraft/Warcraft 3 decided he wanted to play in January. Ended up playing that druid for about 650+ days of in-game play time before I created an alt again. Crazy time on WoW. :P
---
The hardest part of this will be maintaining a roster for a raid.  It's easy enough for people to farm consumables on their own time and commit to 1 hour of scheduled raiding.  The longer the required raid time is, the fewer people will be able to commit.
---
Lvl 15 is like what? 8 hours? Seems reasonable. There’s guides that have you ding 10 in under 2 hours. 
---
Works like tag boosting exp. The hardest part is finding enough people. But in a way works like 2 premades waiting in line, so. Just gave to be careful with DHks sabotage
---
There is no such thing as a farm twink like retail. But im going to farm on certain spots with high exp/hour.
---
If you farm till 60 you end up with more gold than questing till 60.
---
Correct. Also consider getting battlenet and downloading all that stuff ahead of time. I’m sure the last thing you want to do on Classic launch day is spend your first 3 hours downloading the last 3 expansions
---
Hmm interesting. I know it's kinda off topic but do you know if blessing of protection will get rid of physical fears like priest/warri fear?
---
I 100% agree with some people (quite a few, really) wanting to play the game optimally to have fun, and thats 100% fine.  Ive done it in the past on retail.
---
To pretend that this sub is somehow some sort of anti-hardcore, 'you can only go slow and smell the roses' circlejerk is flat out wrong, though.  The amount of posts with guides (and how highly upvoted they are) is pretty solid proof that this sub has plenty of support for hardcore players.  Reading through the guild recruitment posts and seeing how many guilds are hardcore/semi-hardcore also reinforces that.
---
At the start of a server your dispels, blessings (freedom, sacrifice and protection), auras and HoJ are much bigger deal than just the raw healing you can pump out. Also the T1 works fine in PvP.
---
People still assume WoW is going to be like it was in 2005. You can't recreate a time period. This game will be flooded with 2019 people who don't play "classic" style.
---
Mazzranache was my first real pet, first had a wolf and then a swoop. But Mazzranache was the first and he stuck with me forever &lt;3 I still have him on my account I think.
---
I don't understand what that comment is supposed to mean.
---
I sincerely hope they use next Blizzcon to try and win people back...rather than simply avoid the event altogether. 
---
I think he's talking about getting through the overcrowded 1-15 zones only to start a new character and do it again instead of keeping up the leveling on one char and then starting the alt a few days later when it might actually be possible to find mobs to kill under lvl 15.
---
I hope somebody finds out which before launch. I don’t want to be stuck with a 50/50 on picking the correct one.
---
So he tagged the pvp bosses in a solo group and then raid cleared. Leaving him all honor and the raid with nothing? I guess I can see how it's effective but it seems pretty selfish of a guild leader, especially a Paladin. Those R14 weapons are way more useful on real damage classes and he def shouldn't be the priority of the entire guild.
---
herbalism is better. 
---
server list
---
My first character was a Nelf Druid which I got to just over 20.  I rerolled UD priest and that was my main trough vanilla.
---
They're okay for farming gold. You have to push more buttons with more skill than hunter or mage, and it's still not as much gold per hour.
---
On the bright side, if Classic eventually progresses to TBC , warlock gets much better while mage becomes worthless.
---
More details on sharding. Which zones specifically, and what timeframes specifically. If they really wanted to foster good will they've offer some sort of refund policy as leverage for if they ever add sharding again past that initial "launch period" that they already plan to do. Or even more ideally, coming out and saying no sharding at all.
---
Pre-1.4 epic mounts. Will they be available or not? Related, will quest rep affect all cities in the faction or just the main city the questgiver is a part of?
---
Server List, including names, types, and timezones.
---
In that order.
---
Yeah I’m guessing that’s how he did it. Well he isn’t r14 yet, only a regular marshal. Maybe he did let some of his guildies get it first?
---
What a shame Loatheb decurses himself. Would be nice to have a 40 minute raid naptime while 5 people do all the work.
---
I wonder why troll shaman is the least played shaman. Tbh I like their casting animations and their racial is sick but I went with male Tauren shaman for that sweet big ass armor. 
---
Yeah, I know the healing in PvE is somewhat consistent from BC back to classic. But I always found it enjoying managing mana and being a single target healer. And being the pocket healer for any melee dps was always great for BG’s or leveling if I didn’t want to play ret. 
---
I could never really get into the Prot side of things, but I figured I might give it a shot for some 5 mans later on during classic if I get the itch. Thanks for the info! 
---
I'm in a semi casual guild and our main tank is dual wielding most boss and trash. Even without the big dick DPS, threat is often more of a problem than survivability when content is on farm.
---
So even with your pvp gear, you're still going to be a bitch to kill. A priest will be better at keeping larger groups alive. But when I played a holy pally in BG's, I enjoyed picking someone at random. Warriors and hunters were my favorite. And just take on the mentality of "You aren't allowed to die, unless I say you can die!" 
---
But in the middle of a huge brawl in AV, keeping lots of people up can be a challenge. The plus side being, you take FOREVER to OOM. So you can usually outlast other healers.
---
Oof, I'd rather not know than see 111 days.   
---
Trying my best to forget about it so it comes sooner...but that's not working out so well. &gt;\_&lt;
---
I see, less of a pocket healer and more utility focused. That I can get used to. Thanks for the info! 
---
Would definitely give Horde the edge in terms of ease. With that said, I'd pick the Elwynn &gt; Westfall &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood run 10 times outta 10. Way more fun, and I love the aesthetic. 
---
If my crew wasn't set on Horde for Classic, I'd probably roll Alliance solely for the fact that I enjoy 1-60 so much more on that faction.
---
What are you, from the 80s? You’re not supposed to have fun in games in 2019, dude.
---
Why do mages become worthless? 
---
Yeah, I was just wanting to make sure that sort of playstyle was there in Classic. I’m glad to hear that’s unchanged. Thanks for the reply!
---
&gt; Hamstring kiting really has nothing to do with anything you're talking about. Hamstring kiting can reduce your incoming damage by 50-70%.
---
Meaning your rage generation is reduced. Because you are taking less damage. Rage is generated from taking damage.
---
&gt; Would you really rather take 2x or more extra damage just so you can Heroic Strike a bit more, for slightly more damage?
---
When playing the class as it was designed, meaning using a 1h and shield until you get far enough into arms to get deep wounds, impale and 2h weap spec then yeah, you would.
---
&gt;Saying that "Warriors are meant to be hit!" doesn't negate any of that math. Warriors will be hamstring kiting on the Blizzard server too.
---
What? I'm not hamstring kiting on p severs, and I do fine. In fact, in preparation for classic, I've been leveling a warrior both horde and alliance. One 1h and shield until I get 2h talents, one with a 2h and hamstring kiting. Hamstring kiting is nurturing the class.
---
&gt;This strategy didn't even start with WoW... in EverQuest we called it jousting.
---
Kiting has always existed, and exists for a reason. Doesn't mean its the best way to level.
---
The argument I'm making is that Hamstring Kiting is two fold: 
---
1) Hamstring kiting is used to compensate for incorrect values on private severs, which is making leveling even more difficult for warriors to begin with
---
2) Private server strategies that are being used to compensate for bugs are not the same strategies and meta that existed in vanilla, and work better based on the context of a properly constructed vanilla experience.
---
Hamstring kiting was one obvious example.
---
As someone who hates flying having played recently on a TBC server:
---
Flying is not all that bad. The problem with flying is when it's super fast, when you stop using flight paths, when you only travel in the air.
---
60% mount does none of that. Man that mount is slow as fuck, and it's perfect. 
---
There's problems with 60 flying sure mainly that you are safe. What if we removed that part? Something like limited height(you can still climb mountains because the height is based how far from ground you are) and abilities that took you out of flight mode? This way you elimate all the bad pvp parts of it, and keep the epic feeling that is to actually fly and go places where non flyers can't go.
---
Hearthglen
---
Cause blizzard has released details on the scope of sharding, have they?
---
It's not like sharding means there will be 7 people per zone... It'll likely still be dozens and dozens.
---
This made me snort laugh, while drinking pepsi. 
---
The best leveling strategy is to take the time to make friends while you're leveling so you have people to play with at level 60. Hitting level cap ASAP is a short-sighted goal. Building a network and a reputation is what opens the door to the endgame.
---
Sitting around the capital city for a week twiddling your thumbs waiting on tanks and healers to hit 60 with a bunch of speedleveling hunters to keep you company doesn't get you much.
---
I’m hoping we get something, ideally something job board like where you still have to talk to people, but more informative than a global /who or tarde chat.
---
The simple point is that yeah we don't know, but we DO know that private servers are not correct, and we cannot use them as gospels for what classic will be like.
---
That's all I'm pointing out. I don't want new players coming in basing information off of private servers, then not liking the game because the experience is different.
---
Its actually been a while since i read DLC from the beginning.  I still keep up with the weekly comic at this point, though.
---
Hrm...i really dont need other things to distract me from the work i should be doing, though &gt;.&gt;
---
I think it’s pretty safe to assume pops will be similar to west fall in the demo. You could be right they could announce something totally different. No need to start a reddit argument over it.
---
I don't think its pointless to discuss it -- I think its important to discuss it so we don't stick to private server information, and give people an incorrect view of what the game will be like.
---
That's all.
---
Why tf you need to rush with all easy tools? There will be no expiration date in classic. 
---
Ppl tend to forget it and look for fast-food anyways. 
---
You realize being skilled at MMOs mostly boils down to game knowledge, right? It's not CS:GO where you need twitch reactions and Adderall to be better than other people.
---
Yes! It belongs before or alongside ZG.
---
It won't invalidate any gear (common concern) but will still not be utterly useless as it will be in current plan.
---
Insofar as people will (hopefully) be more informed about the mechanics of the game, yes the community will be a little different. However I think people who assume that the meta and playstyle of a game is dependent on the people playing it, and not the other way around, when they slam face-first into the Elwynn Murlocs.
---
&gt; But only when rested.
---
It'll take 266 days to accumulate rested from 20-60.
---
NA/PVP/Alliance - more casual
---
Looking to Raid Sat and Sundays 
---
Are there guilds out there like this? lol
---
Troll Warrior? I think it's neat that they recommend the least-played class.
---
Because in TBC they bring less utility than warlocks while also doing less damage.
---
Research the WoW meme, "getting sunwelled."
---
Yes. Actually being good at the game isn't fun. You need to be as clueless as possible to enjoy it.
---
Literally made it to 10 on a paladin and found out I couldn't use guns.....
---
Ya the new game is like some weird single player mobile crap. Daily checkin, do some tasks no one gives a shit about etc. 
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060705024333/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/resistances.html
---
So if you have 100 nature resistance you will resist on average (100/(63 * 5))*0.75 = 23.8% of huhuran's nature damage. That is really hard to contest. However how that 23.8% is formed by combining different chances of resisting 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of damage, is probably not terribly meaningful.
---
This. All of this. The big thing for me, was when I played classic, I was in a huge rush to 60. As TBC was going to be out in a few months. So I missed soooo much stuff. This time around I just enjoy the journey.
---
In the big picture of AAA publishers, Activision isn't that bad imo. They're no EA at least. I know that's not a great defense, but unless I'm going to only play Indy games I have to be somewhat flexible. I refuse to preorder anything or buy any kind of loot crate or vanity items because I don't want to support those business models. And I hesitate on remasters and game of the year editions because they're usually cash grabs with low effort, not always but frequently. 
---
Blizivision has made some questionable decisions lately, but I don't feel like classic is one of them. I know I'll enjoy it and if my sub can add to the argument that making a game with a classic wow philosophy can be profitable, and they invest more resources into projects like this in the future, then all the better. 
---
Depending on class you can farm Mara/Princess. 
---
I'd say only if you know you'll play for a good while, and probably not as your first character. It'd still probably take you 168 hours of /played (7 days) to hit 60 on the alt if you're not too familiar with the leveling paths.
---
That's a whole lot of prep for a casual player before you even begin farming. In those 168 hours you could've been farming on your shaman. If we are conservative and say you'd make 30g/hour, that's still 5040g. Quite a bit. Then to catch up on your mage who would make around 60g/hr doing DM:E plant runs? 84 hours, but that's 84 hours you could've farmed on your shaman again, another 2520g. It'd take over 300 hours of playing your mage to *break even* with your shaman. At that point, you're in or close to the 10k gold mark. As a non-raider, I don't see a chance you spend all that on one character unless you pop max consumables for BGs.
---
Of course, this neglects the fun aspect. If you want to play a mage as an alt for example, do it. You might even enjoy it to a point of it becoming your main. But if it's exclusively as a farming slave? I'd personally go with no. Maybe you want to because you detest herbing or something, which I'd say makes it more relevant.
---
Although if you're looking into alts for farming gold, I'd suggest looking into alternative methods (like professions, AH, good farming spots or something else).
---
It’s very obvious, when they’re side by side like this, that the old one is easier to look at. Less detail to strain you, less sharp edges, spikes, and dark colours. It’s actually really harsh on the eyes, how did talented professional artists get so tunnelvision with the aesthetic?
---
&gt; Killing Racial Leaders
---
&gt; Killing one of the NPCs considered the leaders of their race. There are only 6 of these, all on a two-hour spawn timer. They provide huge Honor bonuses, divided equally between solo players, parties and raids who participated in the kill. 
---
&gt; The racial leaders, along with their locations, are:
---
&gt; Alliance: Highlord Bolvar Fordragon (Stormwind), King Magni Bronzebeard (Ironforge), Archdruid Fandral Staghelm (Darnassus)
---
&gt; Horde: Thrall (Orgrimmar), Cairne Bloodhoof (Thunder Bluff), Lady Sylvanas Windrunner (Undercity)
---
I wanted to look it up n what the actual honor count was for killing a leader to figure out how he many times they farmed him in a week. Now i'm wondering if this is a private server or something and this method isn't actually even possible. It clearly states that the honor is equally divided from everyone that helps, similar to modern wow tagging system on world bosses.
---
Anyway, original point was going to be R12 was already insanely hard to achieve and it's interesting to see the early investment going to a Ret paladin which is trash across the board. He has less than 3k mana, just pick a goddamn warrior at that point lol
---
Yeeees. I hope so much more people will realize it, Blizzard will hear us out and move it few phases up. It's such a shame/waste otherwise.
---
If moved to BWL/ZG phase, it would be awesome. And wouldn't invalidate anything. And would be nice alternative for non-raiding folk. 
---
Please please please Blizz.
---
Will casual players be 60 before DM launches?
---
I've experienced the same, but it's just 1-2 guys out of 40 who actually have to worry about the threat cap. I'd rather ask a handful of guys to watch KTM than make the precious, rare, burnout-prone healers to burn a ton of mana pots to accomodate those few DPS players.
---
I spent 04-06 trying to get to max level on a gnome rogue. I eventually gave up at around 47 or 51 and twinked out all my characters. I made a druid that I eventually got to max level on in BC. By the time I got to 70, wotlk released literally a week later. Good times...
---
Im not sure what the average days played is for a solo player to hit 60, but 9 days seems pretty good. I think dungeon running from 40-60 isn't a bad idea. Anything before that and all the gear you get will be replaced pretty quickly at 60, but like ZF onward you have a pretty good chance of getting some pre-raid BIS for sure. 
---
I cant wait to camp you :)
---
Huh, so I researched and found out you are right - it was fixed around 1.8ish and talents could not proc from crits while sitting...
---
HOWEVER, I did find out that there was an exploit to get around it (one of those rare exploits where you would WANT a bit of lag). Basically if you spammed “X” to sit/stand/sit/stand, then if a mob hit you while you were sitting and right as you were standing up, then it would register as a crit, but on the server side you would be standing, thus allowing the ability to proc.
---
So... depending on whether they fix that, those guides may still be viable for Classic.
---
2 hours?  Too long, didn’t watch.  Good summary though.  
---
&gt; Horde have to sit in the barrens forever
---
Honestly I'd say horde *gets to* do that. All three of the next leveling zones are adjacent to it too. You pop by Stonetalon a few times and Ashenvale too. Then it's off to Thousand Needles for a bit before a trek to Hillsbrad.
---
That's from level 12 to almost level 30 with no real far treks needed, quite luxurious.
---
I'm considering leveling a mage before my main warrior. Here's some reasons why:  
---
• Warrior has a much easier time as a second character you can send some gold/gear too  
---
• I can come 1 shot stuff like the boss for whirlwind axe (I do plan on 2 accounts)  
---
• Ranking is not out at the beginning anyway  
---
• I also really enjoy mage and plan to be in a guild where there will be multiple raids each week, so I will need an additional 60 anyway (as it's not a private server where they can give me an account of someone who quit)  
---
• Farming, World PvP, etc, great as mage  
---
• 4 professions available (I also plan on a warlock to 35 on each account for another set of professions and summoning bots, these will be leveled in spare time on rested exp only pretty much)  
---
If ranking was available right away, I would just be doing the warrior most likely. I'm also considering just multiboxing them, but would need to look into how to do that properly as I wouldn't want to just alt-tab spam as I've done in the past. 
---
Generally considered a dick move to roll on off-spec when main-spec needs it, unless you've discussed it in advance with the group, so just make sure to be upfront with people unless you want to find yourself without people willing to join you. But if you are tanking you can get away with being more a dick because tanks are generally in high demand.
---
I really want to use cat, however I'm a bit worried that it might not hold up if I'm soloing a tough mob, or elite mob. Bear or Boar might hold up better.
---
Realm populations and the fact that they're moving the release of D2/T0.5 a bit closer (phase 3 or 4)
---
Yeah I know, we mainly did this because the server was SUPER crowded. We felt like this was the way to go, while others were waiting for zhevras to spawn we were inside RFC grinding hard. 9 days is pretty good yeah was about 3 weeks irl 1-60. 
---
I won't before, but I do plan on having both hunter and warlock alts on the go fairly soon, and at least get them to 35 (then do transmutes etc and level very casually)
---
Hopefully this doesn't turn out like Jagex's "Winter 2017" release.
---
I heard Amazon drivers have died from being overworked. But hey, can't beat those prices, right?
---
How will WoW tokens be implemented and how much will they cost?
---
Well I guess the main limit will be the 10 per realm. Which ironically works out very well – 8 classes, 1 bank char, and on PvE realms, 1 Horde/Shaman on the other side.
---
Isn't Mara also not going to be in immediately? I could be wrong on that. 
---
You wish to discover that Classic is being made because tens of thousands already play on private servers.
---
If you are knew and returning ... do what you want. 
---
There are tons of players already devoted to end game as well ... because they literally are playing the end game right now.
---
Oh my god 
---
stop asking
---
 when are you people going to understand
---
hamstring kiting is cool and all but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's still really slow. you just end up using your gold more efficiently since you don't need to buy as much food. also, the lack of escapes for warriors makes it more challenging as well due to gold loss/graveyard runs.
---
OMG did you play on Thrall? If so when I was a 11 year old scrub you guys were my heroes. Never got to 60 or anything but always loved inspecting you guys and hearing about your progress. Too bad they left Thrall and dropped the name Ascent to be called The Gong Ringers :\
---
lick my balls!
---
This is old Vanilla, screenshots are from July 2005 (left) and Aug 2005 (right). This is actually from before they made honor divide equally, and this is why they made honor divide equally.  
---
Jubei would just solo-tag world bosses and then have his guild kill it for him out of group. You can see their confusion in the chat as they wonder why they weren't getting any honor. Jubei was the only one to get honor like this. It was effective, but selfish. Jubei actually stopped at rank13 as he got Sulfuras and didn't need the r14 weapons. Plus, it was becoming increasingly difficult to pull this off as other alliance guilds picked up on it and started training DKs into him. Also, horde started showing up to defend. And of course, Blizzard changed honor to be divided equally soon after they found out what was going on.  
---
Berserking is the only threat increasing CD in the game (faster attack speed = more heroic strikes = more threat), and since you're tanking the boss, it's easy to hit it right after the boss hits you for the maximum bonus attack speed while you're low HP. 
---
It's a really good TPS burst (as well as DPS obviously) if DPS start creeping up on you fast due to a string of crits.
---
That's because this set wasn't made for the raiders.
---
Back in vanilla I wasn't a raider, didn't wanna commit to the time scheule, so I loved when this was released and I could get some nice gear to compliment my rank 10 pieces and soulfire some noobs in PvP
---
There's at least 5 per faction that I know of.  Gelbin Mekkatorque for the gnomes resides in Ironforge.  Vol'jin for the trolls is in Orgrimmar.  Then there's Jaina in Menethil Harbor and Rexxar wandering desolace.  I don't know if those two award honor like the city bosses, but they are faction tagged ?? level NPCs.
---
Just a hint to the boss Sapphiron, it made me think of sapphire the gemstone.
---
I think one of the big reasons classic wow is so great is because of how the community interacts with eachother. Part of that is being able to glance at someone and know roughly what gear they are wearing.
---
If I run into a warrior out in the wild I think it’s extremely important for my decision making to be able to tell just by looking at him that he’s wielding Ash’kandi and r10 pvp gear.
---
You can still wear your cool looking gear when chilling in a city or whatever. When you go to work, you put on your work clothes.
---
I don't know where you have been playing. But in my experience is almost 3:1 in mages:locks at the raiding scene.
---
I LOVE barrens because of the chat. But IF will always be my favourite hangout spot. Im torn :(. 
---
Yeah, I still have all my main chars on Thrall.  Yeah, most of the main crew did go off on some mountain time server, I left before that happened.
---
Yeah, The Gong Show.  A Noshens idea no doubt.
---
You don't need to be an affliction lock to have Nightfall, I had it on my destro lock
---
# #ThereAreAlreadyAlterationWithinTheVanillaTimeline
---
But they didn't have those tools at the time, so they didn't. They balanced the game world around this cap. They wouldn't have you kill 15 Defias Trappers if you had to compete with hundreds or thousands of people for it.
---
The experience on the Nost-core servers with 10k+ players is insanely off-track for what Blizzlike is.
---
It's why I hoped that once they have a stable Classic, a small dedicated team keeps improving on *the original game* without losing the atmosphere. Buffing other pets so any pet may be a good option would be such a thing. Fill unfinished parts of the world with new quests and lore etc. Ever so slightly tweak class balance. Little tiny things while at the same time preserving the community feel. 
---
Or just like to "do things well". It is not about being better than other people, it's about doing stuff as well as you can with your current knowledge about the subject. Some people enjoy that. 
---
Hah yeah I'll probably end up with both eventually.
---
It's a myth that pvp is worse on RP servers. They usually just want the naming rules so gankers don't have stupid, insulting names.
---
RP is about a distant 30th concern to most.
---
Exploiting bannable tagging mechanics to boost any aspect of your character is fundamentally unimpressive and uninteresting
---
Hi all. Here is a short little video on the Gurubashi Arena from vanilla World of Warcraft. Please let me know what you think of it. I hope you enjoy.
---
I see! I wasn't super into the PVP scene back then and I never downed all the faction leaders until Wrath so I was pretty unsure. I'm surprised he even had guild members willing to follow him lol, the best guild masters are never greedy like that.
---
Glad to hear the world sorted it out. I wish it wasn't so difficult to find earlier vanilla patch information. Genuinely curious how much honor a single boss gave now.
---
&gt;It's more that I don't understand what you lose by rolling on a regular RP server given no RP-PVP.
---
All of the benefits of a PvP server, you're overthinking it.  I'm not going to be in character while my guild farms Devilsaurs.  Nor am I going to play on a PvE server and just watch the other faction tag those mobs without contention.  Same for world bosses, same for wanting to attack raid groups.  Events like naked gnome races are only great because of PvP servers.
---
When my RP buddies are offline, I'd like to spend some time in Southshore roleplaying in the PvP sense.
---
Id day healer. Tanks are too hard to replace if you are missing a raid due to irl stuff.
---
Earthshaker is the shit
---
Tank 5 man : Druids are the best 5man tank imho, high hp, high mitigation, high threat, can pre hot before pull to get even more threat and you will stay full life for 10 seconds. Innervate and battle rez can save you from a wipe if someone asspull (can be tricky to go out of bear to use but doable if for example you can charge a lone mob that you let go on purpose to a rdps to get away from the pack you are tanking to have enough time to do this for example).
---
Tanking in raid is also viable (mostly as an offtank and maintanking a few bosses where feral are better).
---
Questing : druid is the second best levelling class, only class beside hunter able to get a server first 60. Feral is great for grinding no downtime and you can even solo most elites. Great for world pvp because you have lot of tools, stealth mobility heals ranged and melee damage.  The skillcap is high in pvp and you lack burst damage tho, priests warlock and shaman are hard to kill but if you have to you can just run away (no one can really stop you) and then you can just wait in stealth for an adequate moment to gank.
---
Healing in raid : Druids aren't considered as the best healer (though you can do quite fine) and as they don't stack well (because hot overwriting) a raid won't bring alot. You shouldn't have any problem finding a spot since druid is usually one of the least played class, and less druids in raid mean you get gear really fast.
---
The 0/30/21 spec will allow you to heal and tank quite well. It is also a good pvp spec. In battleground you won't be healing that much tho. In wsg your main goal is to carry the flag, in ab you might heal if there aren't enough healer but you will most likely be asked to guard a base.
---
Protection is probably the spec that changed the most in 2.0, getting a taunt, mana regen and actual itemization. So if you're not super into prot I think you'll find paladin comfortable still.
---
My first character ended at level 27. It was a Tauren Warrior and it was on a family member's account who introduced me to WoW.
---
Once I got my own account I rolled Alliance with a friend from school but always stuck with Warrior.
---
They are in the Barrens too. The level 25 named one is dark red and have a slightly faster base attack than normal too (going off memory).
---
Never tame the caster variants though.
---
Absolutely... warlocks have always been outcasts, a necessary evil at best, even on Alliance. That's why the hide in basements in SW and why they're basically confined to a hole in the ground in Orgrimmar. I suppose that the one advantage Forsaken locks would have in that way would be their acceptance in Forsaken society, but I somehow doubt that these are the things most people are thinking about when choosing their race :) RPers are a minuscule portion of a general population, as shown in this poll as well.
---
Source on #2?
---
Role playing in an rpg? No way!
---
Subconsciously you know you are better than most people when you try that hard which is a huge driving force
---
I honestly think male trolls are the coolest looking race in Vanilla. Obviously in a minority, but I adore all of my troll characters and was really let down when they changed their original animations and models. Boots kinda suck on them, though, I can agree on that.
---
The fact that it’s BoE though can make you self reliant a bit. I don’t have a ton of time, but am rolling a Warrior anyway. The fact that I can get my BIS helm by just farming in off hours when I can randomly play is pretty cool. I can just play the AH farm up gold and get Stuff like Devil Saur, Lion, Cloudkeepers etc. it’ll let me feel like I’m always working toward something productive even if it’s only to hop on for an hour and do some fishing or something.
---
Exact server size (nobody knows what this is exactly) we have a range, but no real clear answer.
---
Macros
---
Wall walking and world exploration
---
Will DM &amp; BRD farming be nerfed or not
---
Addons 
---
Pet attack speed: will it be normalized or not
---
Ima charging my fireball!
---
Right, way too many locks.
---
The wPvP case is a good one indeed.
---
Then if we also talk about non-bg environments, a simple thing would be to at least let a player choose what he sees on himself (among the ones he already has looted at least once of course), without it being displayed to other players.
---
Again, if a player thinks a T0 set or a PvP set fits himself better visually, and that it makes him enjoy the game more, when not letting him display to himself what he actually likes, makes sense to me.
---
But in order to clear MC + BWL in a reasonable time frame you want people to be buffed, which means a few hours of additional consumable farming each week. Also there is ZG which you can run every 3 days, some guilds schedule this twice a week, others you just PUG
---
I don't like the idea of logging on one day, to pick up where I've left off, only to find everything gone, without warning. 
---
Hopefully classic is so different that it puts these chumps out to pasture.
---
Exhibit A: Private server players only use worldbuffs and consumables because they are bad and can't clear the raid without them. In REAL Vanilla, we never used worldbuffs or flasks.
---
Exhibit B: How can private server players clear Naxx so soon after release when it took retail Vanilla players 3 months? Must be because private servers are easy compared to REAL Vanilla!
---
Roll paladin and warrior, join a guild and play whatever they need at the time. It would increase usefulness if you can’t commit due life constraints. Just my opinion.
---
&gt; /script if not IsCurrentAction(24) then UseAction(24) end;
---
Thats great if your macro'd action is off cooldown. Doesnt work if its still counting down though.
---
Well the healers don't seem to have that much problem nor do they seem to need to burn mana pots (since if everyone can just dps at full power the fight is shorter also).
---
About Half of our wipes used to happen because of one dps pulling aggro,  now it's way less.
---
Off course you shouldn't do that on hard hitting boss.
---
You're not wrong about leaders, but these are the leaders that counted. Trolls and Gnomes are under the umbrella of the leader they are staying with and are basically puppet leaders. Orc and Dwarves call the shots, because they are the ones giving the race a place to stay.
---
At least that is probably why they only counted it that way. It might have also been to keep any particular city from being a more appetizing raid target. i.e. why raid SW when Ironforge has two bosses to kill.
---
You could do it for bragging rights but according to all records the extra bosses gave no reward
---
how päor if they use sharding and when and how they will introduce bgs
---
Major characters obviously, although you will still see plenty of Íllīdáns I'm sure. 
---
0.5 should become available toward the late end of BWL. It's nice catchup gear for non-raiders.
---
However, certain set bonuses (rogue 4pc) are actually competitive with BWL items so we don't want to disrupt progression too much. Making it available late in the tier would make it at least relevant for a short time before replacing it with AQ gear.
---
'These chumps' will be the fastest to adapt and discover the new metas too mate.
---
Druid in vanilla compared to TBC and WoTLK is completely different.  Basically, blizz realized how shitty druids were so they revamped them during those two expansions.  Leveling a Druid in vanilla is so damn slow, and second rate at every role - I wouldn’t recommend it.
---
Cleared Naxx on a now dead pserver a couple years ago. Hardly anybody logs in there now, just a couple guilds raiding. I gave my account away.
---
Seriously. I don’t get “outrageously upset” when an actual, real problem arises irl. 
---
Why would that happen for blizz choosing 1.12 AV for their 1.12 game?
---
Snowflakes.
---
ERP in gold shire never fails
---
Good deal, not a bad strategy at all. 
---
I don't think a ton of players today know what theyre going to play for sure, so I think the first few zones maybe to level 30 are going to be crowded as hell, but then itll slowly get to "normal" where you wont have to fight for spawns as much as things like that. 
---
So I guess my main concern is getting to 15 fast and stay head of that group thats trying to get to 30 the first time =). 
---
I want to play on a server where horde and alliance are enemies, not frenemies. The constant fear, the adrenaline when our quest party meet an alliance quest party. The tension.
---
And role playing that as well, it's amazing.
---
Came here to say this.  Vanilla druids were pretty trash, they got huge buffs in TBC and Wrath to make up for how crap they were in vanilla.
---
That's what good players have in common. Quick to learn and to find holes beyond the established meta game.
---
Never used em. Don't need em. And most of them look terrible.
---
Oh! Except Atlastloot. Love looking at gear while I'm flying.
---
Someone likes to romanticize things. 
---
the proper guild idea, imo, is that the guild provides elixirs and certain pots. This ensures everyone is buffed appropriately, short of flasks, for raids.
---
The players' job is to get geared up in 5-mans and show up for the raids.
---
A few will send materials to the guild bank. The guild alchemist makes the elixirs and distributes them at the start of the raid.
---
Something like that, anyway.
---
I'm #nochanges but I'd like blizzard to allow the UI mote customization by default. Click and drag, frame resizing - not just all or nothing 
---
A couple of addons that people depend on heavily are going away. No Decursive is going to make coordinating dispels of a 40 man raid MUCH harder. And personally I liked Healbot for some multibox shenanigans.
---
We are probably getting improvements to some other addons. CthunWarner should have a better version with the new API to accurately determine distances between you and other players.
---
&gt;It's no longer an MMORPG. It's a open-world, third-person looter shooter with a $15 sub fee.   
---
I always say this, but I say it's no longer an MMORPG, it's a single player online action game.  
---
Button mashing every GCD or less, no concern for managing resources like mana, just fire everything immediately, always. 
---
I knew a lot of mages that liked to PvP in 8/8 T2 for the instant spellcast proc
---
Stuff like this is exactly why I have no understanding of why people were concerned classic wouldn't be "newb friendly." Like what? You realize 100% of everyone who played retail vanilla was a newb, since it was a brand new game? IMO Vanilla is simultaneously the most noob/casual friendly, and the most hardcore player friendly.
---
It was capped by design. They wanted to create a community where you were more likely to recognise other players, so they deliberately set the cap lower than what their hardware could support and designed the game around that.
---
Agreed!
---
&gt; Do you want to roleplay with worse pvp, or pvp with worse roleplay. 
---
&gt; It's a myth that pvp is worse on RP servers. 
---
No one said it is. RP servers are PvE flagged. RP Servers have worse PvP.  
---
I don't think he meant there is no grind, just no *daily* grind. I hate daily grinds. It becomes a chore. It's not an opportunity to do something everyday, it's an expectation, because every other player is doing it, and if you miss a single day, you are forever that far behind. Vanilla the grind is completely free flowing. Farm 1 hour every day if you want, or farm 7 hours on a sunday afternoon. The choice is yours; you have not permanently missed out on something by choosing your own schedule.
---
They have stated they could “dial it up” if they chose to. However, they have also said they are going for an authentic experience, and the authentic population caps are known.
---
Of course it's a thing. You just have to pay the sub fee for every account, have a powerful enough computer to run everything at once, and spend a bunch of time setting up macros and mastering controlling everything at once.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxR8D0RbDJU
---
There is a neutral warlock trainer in Ratchet though, which you necessarily were sent to when doing your class quests :-)
---
Did you thinj about rolling a shaman?
---
- For the look mail is close to plate.
---
- orc and tauren can look as beefy as warriors
---
- shaman being healer and buffer is key role and really appreciated
---
- playstyle has variety and the class doesn't have as much time demand raid-wise as main tank and  mt healers (priests).
---
My 2 coppers... :)
---
How about the people who want into the beta, but can't due to lack of availability?
---
It'd no longer be a beta if you keep progress. It's a soft launch. The beta would also be forced to have a level cap, because people can hit 60 in under a week no problem. Fastest pserver record IIRC is 3 days and 7 hours.
---
Letting you keep progress pushes people away from the game. It's an unfair advantage, and unfair advantages are the last thing they want people to think of when they think of Classic.
---
Beta is a big marketing event. They can use it to generate hype throughout the sector.
---
I use combat text addons anyway so meh...
---
Yes, a priority just like not having all the server types we need at launch.
---
Incorrect.
---
Make way for the big dick Blood Fury tank who isn't afraid of a puny boss.
---
You can't dispel a fear if you're also feared..
---
I was 20 on release day. Im not going to be 35 on rerelease! (Classic) how time has changed.
---
Yeah, i think you are correct.
---
 I'm just afraid that every other fresh 60 Warrior in Classic will spec fury/prot because that's what the big boys do, although all the DPS is in blue gear... He said it in the Interview pretty clear: Go deep prot first and when threat becomes a problem, consider the impale build and then at some time try out the fury/prot. Wait for threat to be relevant, then specc into more threat generation. At least that will be my route..
---
I was looking forward to Naxxramas myself. Too bad it wasn’t there the vast majority of Vanilla.
---
Hey, my comment was deleted because a link I had included a private server name I guess, I responded pretty shortly after you posted. But in short, 2H Axe warrior is one of the easiest progression paths, just google some stuff and you will find many results
---
&gt;theorycrafters are dumb
---
I never really understood this meme.
---
Here's some more early-level challenge tames for anyone interested. Most of them are only challenging for Horde, since Durotar and Mulgore are easy to reach while Dun Morogh and Teldrassil are fortified warzones.
---
This info is taken from Classic Petopia which is still in the works, so there may be some mistakes. 
---
**Bats** - Prior to Eastern Plaguelands and choice dungeons, the only place to get bats is Tirisfal Glades. To make it worse most have a knock-down move making them impossible to tame unless you can incapacitate it long enough. White, Red and Brown are available - the next time you'll meet them is in Shadowfang Keep, Razorfen Kraul and *Zul'Gurub*.
---
**Polar Bear** Only available in two locations: Dun Morogh and Winterspring. To make it even more challenging they're only available as two single named mobs, one is a rare and the other a quest mob. 
---
**Snow Leopard** - Not counting the ghost variant in Darkshore, this mob is exclusively found in Dun Morogh.
---
**White Lion** - Significant in that its sole two appearances has to be spawned in through quests. Horde get easy access at level 16, but Alliance must wait all the way to 60 to get their chance - unless they make a pact with a Horde player, have them spawn Echeyakee and let them tame it. 
---
**Red Crab** - Only available in Durotar, and later spawned as part of a Horde Quest in the Barrens.
---
*'Brown Scorpion** - Exclusive to Durotar
---
**Olive Spider** - Available in the starting area of Tirisfal and Western Plaguelands. 
---
**Pink Tallstrider** - The one, the only, and exclusive to Mulgore. On top of this it's a rare, so at any given time there can only be one in the wild.
---
 Yeah there's no reason to run them to an inn below level 10, but at the very least it is worth it to make the character at the same time as you make your main for that tiny speed boost when you finally do start it. Or even just get it to 10 before your main and stick it in an inn while you level your main.
---
Yes, yes and yes. Time to write Putin a letter to change the great nation to a summer nation.
---
Is not all this knowledge coming from the  state of private servers which we now know are very different than the 1.12 code base we'll be getting.
---
I feel like we can't make all assumptions and conclusions that we want. 
---
&gt; only
---
I dont have the source, but PLENTY of comments have said the realm pop was a choice, not a limitation.
---
"gibs me dat or selfish"
---
Modding my wow is my jam! I do have a problem.
---
I for one am looking forward to some of the modern addons coming to the game since its built on top of the client code base for 7. This means some very nice additions like Weak Auras and a working ElvUI and working Clique.. 
---
And to the guy below with the no decursive..dude.. Decursive is still in retail and works fine.
---
As far as pally power MAN I hope someone picks up reigns and brings it into compliance. 
---
No it was a a month or two after the announcement I believe. I actually forgot to link the video, and it's posted later down the chain
---
Go tame a Kodo!!!!
---
Word makes sense they would just write a tool to forward port the old db rather than write adapters to read it in the old format
---
Tyrs hand is one of my favourite spots 
---
It's ridiculously easy lmao. Personally I don't know if you can level 2 characters in parallel faster than you can level them in series, but I can tell you that you can definitely level 5 characters in parallel faster than you can in series.
---
&gt; refined
---
lol, good one!
---
Personally I don't know if you can level 2 characters in parallel faster than you can level them in series, but I can tell you that you can definitely level 5 characters in parallel faster than you can in series.
---
Still saying July 16th.
---
So I feel kind of like a black sheep here. Most people mention end game goals. Mine aren't really. Sure I want to do all that stuff, but the big thing I want to do is help all the people who will be new to classic. I really want classic to be a huge success. And let's be honest, leveling early levels, coming from BFA is going to be rough. Being a new warrior is going to be rough period. So a partner and I are rolling human pallies. We're going to rush to 5-6 to grab mining/bs for me and Herb/alchemy for her.
---
Then we're not going to quest. Just run around goldshire, gathering mats and cloth. The entire time saving all the greens we get. 
---
We want to do all this so we can craft weapons for new warriors and pallys, as well as pots and bandaids. So as soon as they get to goldshire, we can give out as many "care packages" as we can. Then do the same in westfall. 
---
The big thing I'd like to do, is set a culture on my server. Make it so, if someone needs help, has a question, or is getting camped, they just "Ask a Paladin!" May seem cheesy or lame, but to me that sounds like a lot of fun. :)
---
Well, if I keep up with my history, I'm likely a holy priest. 
---
So solo farming before DM? Nope :(
---
Silithus.
---
Gotta find another way to make money buddy, blowing truckers is killer for your knees 
---
That does sound awesome. 
---
He's the one asking questions, and with uninformed questions, you're not going to reach the deep dive you're looking for. 
---
Can't.
---
I don't know a hard number, but you'll want pretty much every spell or consumable keybound for high-end PvP. Raiding is a little simpler, you could probably get away with just your assigned curse, shadowbolt, and lifetap, otherthings you'd generally have time to mouseover and click while your shadowbolt is in the middle of casting
---
&gt; You can't get too far in the end game playing solo  
---
&gt; Charisma can arguably be more important than performance  
---
&gt; Requires a large amount of time commitment to keep up with others  
---
These all contribute to the sense of community and keep people logged in, keep the world alive
---
Yea man sorry, its based on weather.  You might look into getting a vacation home, or possibly moving all together.  Typical Blizzard not thinking about their fans before they announce something like this.  Btw I heard there might be a private server hack, where if you can turn up your furnace and/or woodstove in order to replicate a summer like temperature in your home you'll "trick" the client into letting you on.  Good Luck.
---
If you just want to DE items and sell mats and not actually worry about leveling enchanting, you can level a bank alt to 5 and give them enchanting.  Then just mail them all greens etc..and let them DE and auction.
---
That's what I always do.
---
I go through phases where I try out a bunch of sleek looking UI mods, but then I end up encountering problems that I need other mods to fix, which create new problems, etc.  Then after two weeks I just get rid of them all and go back to default UI. 
---
Well, we can be sure it's at least 4,000 if we assume every single kill "yesterday" was a faction leader. But it's probably at least double that as I doubt he killed 9 faction leaders in one day especially because I think there were only 5 different leaders and waiting for respawns would have been impossible as horde would gather. Plus, of his 9 kills I bet at least a few HKs are from the actual players he ran into on his way to BRM or killing faction leaders. That puts the value at around 10,000 but even that seems low. Getting his 170k honor in a week would require over 2 raid kills a day and I just don't think Skyfang was hardcore enough to pull that off especially since this pic was taken right as BWL progression was hitting, July 05. Also, those leaders were straight up a pain in the ass to kill with horde defending, guards and DKs.
---
So maybe 19,250? Or even 38,500? (Has to be a factor of 38,500 as we have to account for him getting 0-100 honor for each regular kill he got)
---
Then you can do skinning and Alchemy or Engineering and level it as you go and actually use the stuff as you level too.
---
From a strictly speaking min/max perspective, Gnome is superior. From a realistic point of view? You will be staring at this character for hundreds/thousands of hours, if not hundreds of days. If you do not like gnome aesthetics/casting/etc and love human's, pick human mate.
---
Thank you! It's been a while since you posted this but it really helped me and some comments were very helpful. Im preparing all my lists for official Classic and cant wait to try to be one of the first warriors that hits level 60 on my server. Much love from Germany !
---
&gt; hit it right after the boss hits you for the maximum bonus attack speed while you're low HP.
---
Does it snapshot the attack speed based on that low HP and maintain it for the rest of the duration of the buff?
---
I thought multiboxing was canon at this point so I didn't think I needed to explain further.  Of course you can buy 40 accounts and raid by yourself.
---
OPs topic was asking if you could log in multiple times from one account.  I can't run ZG with my two accounts so "there's no way that's a thing."
---
My advice, especially if you are not prepping in advance to be spamming log in day 1:  
---
Don't touch professions.  You want out ahead of THE WAVE.   Even the extra time skinning adds up.  
---
There are going to be people everywhere. 
---
If you're going to say it's bad, provide an example why. Strangely nobody is ever able to do that. 
---
And no, getting muted for saying something racist doesn't count as "bad." 
---
&gt; I will have a couple accounts but it wouldn't make logical sense to be able to form my own raid by multi-logging with them.
---
You are clearly talking about multiple accounts, I'm confused here. You could run ZG with your 20 accounts if you had the proper setup.
---
Exactly and the ones that are have a 2 hour queue and so much lag you disconnect walking into iron forge and your permanently stuck in that trench to boot. 
---
This is something I never tried.  Are people just killing the final boss and resetting or is there more to it?
---
Small world, I played for a while on Alliance Burning Blade. 
---
You're absolutely right!  I've changed the opening—I hope it gives you and your list the credit you deserve.  As for those other tools, I didn't include them originally because I didn't consider them to be class specific.  I'll include the Base Stats Calculator here, plus add a message at the top directing people to your list if they want a more comprehensive index!
---
Humar. In early December 2004, somebody told me I'd never get him, especially as Alliance.
---
Shortly after, after camping out for an eternity, I got him.
---
Use him on all my hunters since, even now, 14+ years later.
---
Some classes can kill Rottgrip and Grizlock too
---
In MC you'll get the leaf, which is BiS for hunters, and is a bow. In BWL you'll get a xbow which you will use up until naxx, where you will get another xbow. (There is a gun along the way in AQ40 which is sidegrade at best if not a downgrade, but if you wanna use it because dwarf, go ahead).  
---
I think while leveling some bows will be better, but other than that most 60 hunters are xbows most of the time.

Patch 1.12 has been living on for 10 years brother

I felt this...I felt this all too well XD
---
yes, that's my experience at least.
---
Exceptions prove the rule.
---
Its not catchup gear in any way, its just another gearing route for players.
---
But I digress, yes it needs to be made available sooner than it was canonically.
---
By 7 do you mean client 7.X.X? Or the popularly reference 7.3.5?  
---
If so, do you have any proof that Classic will be using 7.3.5?  
---
Well, saying they suck at PvP is not completely BS either. Druids are good when it comes to mobility and outlasting opponents, but are bad for absolutely everything else. Healing is unreliable because too slow, DPS is unreliable because too low, and CCing is unreliable because too Druids have to little of it. If you're into long 1v1 fights, high skill-cap and versatility it's an awesome class though. Else, not so much saddly.
---
Weird though? Instead of worrying so much about how other people like to play their game and spend their time, why not focus on yourself and enjoying the game the way you choose?  
---
Yes. The players should NEVER outnumber the mobs in any zone, and on Nost it happened all the time. 
---
Yes, that's exactly how it works, it's even in the description.

Half of the sub maybe. The other half thinks anyone who doesnt put in every hour they can to bring maximum consumables to every inch of content and play only the best specs doesnt deserve to even touch the game.

1. How dare you?

2. What gives you the right?

3. Who do you think you are?
---
/s
---
Gnome is way better for pvp, but I agree if you don't like the look of it. 
---
Can’t speak to elites. Otherwise perfectly fine. I mostly focus on massive amounts for grinding while traveling between quests and cat is perfect for that
---
there is no way fresh 60s can do Strat Live from side entrance to finish in 20 minutes.
---
It was the tbc beta key that killed our raiding progression. Once people saw level 66 gear would replace their hard earned epics, many threw in the towel.
---
Not really a fan of any UI addons except something to make my bag one giant window instead of several small ones.
---
Fair, but that’s also significantly lower amounts of people farming the herb. You won’t have EU/AP farming it all night either, so you’ll likely only really have a fraction of that 1/6 of the possible herbs available. Not saying people won’t use flasks, but I would be surprised if all guilds required all players to be flasked to the extent you see on pservers.
---
I assumed that but I also assumed there would duplicate spells for downranking and also target macros, focus, pet macros, ect. 
---
Theres a few addons i really cant play without (bagnon is the biggest one.  I cant stand having multiple bags for some reason), and honestly i really like having larger/easier to see unitframes.
---
I'd say things like that are just fine in Classic, though.  It doesnt change the experience, it just makes things aesthetically 'better' for some of us.  
---
From what ive heard/read, a lot of the original addons wont be able to be used anymore because of changes to what Blizz allows addons to do, and thats fine by me.  Someone already mentioned decursive/healbot, and honestly thats probably a good thing.  They were patched out of retail for a reason.
---
The description does not say that it snapshots.
---
We wont know in classic but currently it does yes
---
Have you ever participated in some economy anywhere on this planet?  
---
I saw a video of a head slot item that shoots lightning. It had Int and Spirit on it, but I couldn’t make out the name. Any idea what it’s called?
---
Don't get too excited. You need to level Enchanting to 265 first, craft a trinket, then drop it for Skinning.
---
That trinket is a best-in-slot for tanking until TBC.
---
No shit Sherlock...how nerdy are you?
---
Ty, exactly what I was looking for
---
Nah... there won't be any beta for Classic. 
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
&gt; However, a non mana based dps is probably your answer. DPS warrior comes to mind.
---
This is so backward. Fury Warrior is the most consumable heavy spec.
---
Washte Pawnee or something.  
---
People keep saying this, yet I remember reading strategies on every boss and even watching videos and having deadly boss mod alert me about various things.
---
i'm also away that weekend but i will totally cancel my plans for this lol. 
---
Both gf and I just want to log in, do things in the world, fight some enemies, do some quests, farm some ingredients, enjoy the scenery and talk to cool people. Without the fuss and stress. 
---
The description is a little scuffed, it should read  
---
&gt;Increases your attack speed by 10 to 30%.  At full health the speed increase is 10 with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking.  Lasts 10 sec.  
---
It specifically mentions 'when you activate' and says that it lasts 10 seconds.
---
I want to hear what blizzard have to say about right click report , other than that It doesn’t matter really
---
Sounds like you know what you want to play.  You might not be a MT of a guild, but it doesn't sound like you'll be able to have a set raid schedule anyways.  You can offtank or MT a pickup raid on some random night you have time.  I think the biggest bonus with players of limited time is just being a tank, if you only have 90 minutes you can generally hop on find a group and get a raid done since you're the hardest piece to find.  Gear is very important, but trying to stay at that cutting edge isn't that big of a deal when most of us have cleared all the content (except full Naxx) anyways.  I'd gladly take a very skilled tank with some BiS gear over a bad tank with BiS gear if you catch my drift.
---
No dude, I want the BLUE staff
---
Too much cum
---
Thanks Khos.
---
You absolutely can if you play in a set group of players who trust each other. 
---
Warrior, warrior, resto shaman, mage, warlock is the best for this. Make sure to hand out the crate waters equally and you can burn through the undead packs very well. The warrior always LoS pulls into corner and all wait for ALL mobs to be on him, then all open up. 
---
When farming you skip canoneer, because you want as many shots at the mage food book and truefaith recipe as possible as it sells for 400-700g depending on rarity and buyer. 
---
Skip as much undead stuff as possible, because the main moneymaker are orbs. 
---
So faction leader kills gave an honorable kill? Interesting, I was assuming it just gave honor, but that does make sense.
---
Thanks for the math. That puts into perspective how effective it could have been. Really glad people helped negate it with DK chaining and defense. This is the least honorable way to get honor I have come across. Respect for the snip of you farming the old fashion way. 
---
Wool cloth ftw
---
But do you think they'll return for classic?
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I want to have engeneering for sure and since I really want to enjoy journey to 60 without rushing anything I'd like to have engeneering from beginning (iron granades around lvl 35 in STV will be huge in pvp. Mining is obvious choice with this plan. 
---
Problem is that it's really handy to have a tailoring atleast as fresh 60, because of epic bop pre-bis robe.
---
Skinning is a really good financial boost on fresh server and goes well with tailoring imo.
---
Well the addon I care about the most is bartender since the base UI is pretty awful and I don't see that being something blizzard will be removing as it existed in vanilla.
---
Some of the more interesting decisions will be threat add ons, the modern API has threat exposed which makes threat meters much more accurate.
---
I played a feral  druid as my alt in Vanilla.  
---
5mans is fine and easy.  
---
Raids well your OT at best, you can reach highest armour and hp in the game.  But your not uncrittable. This point will make/break you.  And let me assure you the biggest problem you will have is persuading RL about your viability.  You are viable as healers can heal you easy with another strategy (dropping long heals on you).   
---
Feral is nice in vanilla but you want rouge gear and good luck getting it in raids.  The other issue is you got less defensive tools. 
---
And cat druids is max 90% of a rogue dps.  
---
So basically it’s a nich spec but if you feel it’s fun go for it!! Because I enjoyed it.  
---
Bingo
---
No, he went deep into Naxx on retail vanilla as well. Also, he doesn't play in a slacker guild. They are clearing content in the fastest, most efficient ways possible, not barely make it through. Meaning any value changes we will see on classic will have a small impact for those who are min-maxing anyways. They will still clear content super fast. Also keep in mind that some pservers have increased difficulty raids to make up for 1.12 talents which we won't have on classic.
---
It won't. These "chumps" are the best of the best and they won't have *any* problem in classic at all. Psevers often have increased diffculty raids to make up for 1.12 talents which classic will not have.
---
I joined with my wife.   She was a hunter and got a pet.   I, a lowly priest, quit when i found out i couldnt get a pet.
---
Rejoined a month later as a hunter
---
The price of the rare/epic mount makes this idea stupid.
---
My first character ended at 70, when Wrath came out and I rerolled DK.
---
Watch the whole thing. He gives good advice for both hardcore and casual raiders alike. He very much avoids giving cookie cutter advice and recommends everyone to know their class and take any BiS lists, Talent guides etc. with a grain of salt.
---
Im going to level my farm character first, just because ive leveled a hunter before, and its fast.  Then grind out maraudon for some gold to setup my main.
---
I am going to start my main up, priest or warrior, to level 15+ and park them at an inn while leveling my farmer.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
&gt;Meaning your rage generation is reduced. Because you are taking less damage. Rage is generated from taking damage.
---
Okay, sure. I addressed this. The rage generation doesn't matter. The small amount of extra damage you get from the additional rage isn't worth taking all of the extra damage. Hitting things also generates rage, which covers your ability to reapply hamstring.
---
&gt;When playing the class as it was designed, meaning using a 1h and shield
---
The phrase "playing the class as it was designed" is absolutely meaningless here. Your argument is that private servers are so inaccurate that strategies like hamstring kiting won't be viable. That's a bunch of crap. Also, who are you to say how Blizzard envisioned the classes in the first place? Warriors can use 2 Handed weapons from level 1, and don't require any talents to be more effective than Sword + Board while leveling.
---
&gt;What? I'm not hamstring kiting on p severs, and I do fine.
---
I obviously never said it was impossible to level without hamstring kiting. I'm saying that it's a very effective strategy to use while leveling, and it'll still be effective on the Blizzard servers.
---
&gt;1) Hamstring kiting is used to compensate for incorrect values on private severs, which is making leveling even more difficult for warriors to begin with
---
Okay, my point is, *what incorrect values* are you specifically referring to? What is wrong which makes hamstring kiting impossible? What is it "compensating" for? Be more specific.
---
&gt;Private server strategies that are being used to compensate for bugs are not the same strategies and meta that existed in vanilla
---
1) What's the bug with hamstring kiting?
---
2) Yes, some strategies exist on private servers that didn't exist on the original servers. This isn't because things are so much different there, but because it's 15 years in the future and players are just better at the game. People used terrible gear back in the day too, that doesn't mean that that's "more correct" than the optimized BIS lists that people follow on private servers.
---
I'll give you another EverQuest example. In vanilla EQ, there was a repeatable quest where you gave a troll a ruby, and you had about a 20% chance of getting a really sweet earring in return. The other 80% of the time you either got an axe or a hammer. These were seen as unfortunate consolation prizes, to be sold to a vendor to recoup part of the cost of the ruby.
---
Fast forward 10 years later. An EQ private server launches called Project 1999, which is essentially EQ's version of Nostalrius. Very quickly players realized something really important about that "useless" hammer called the Midnight Mallet - you could right click it a few times for an effect that would generate a lot of threat. It quickly became meta for tanks to carry around a mallet with them to click into a raid target to start the fight with a large amount of threat, which allowed other characters to start dumping DPS much faster.
---
There was nothing special about P99 that allowed this strategy to emerge besides players being better at the game. In fact, the mallet strategy got carried over to retail EQ.
---
So, just because something becomes meta on a private server that was never the meta 15 years ago doesn't mean that something is inherently wrong with the private server, unless you can back up that claim with actual details and numbers.
---
I'm confused. Healbot isn't gone? It had an update like less than 2 weeks ago for 8.1.5. 
---
hunters can clear most of the bosses solo in there. I use to go for 3 or 4 bosses then reset.
---
No joke I think they are already planning to 
---
I tanked quite some 5m with my Druid and it's actually going great in Vanilla. Never had issues, people would /w me while leveling, Growl is perfect for keeping the mobs on you, and Swipe is great for AoE aggro. Also, if you take the time to get some BiS easily obtainable armor items (Mark of tenacity, Ring of protection, Cloak of warding, Unyielding Maul (when DM is out), and a couple others) you'll out armor in Dire Bear Form absolutely all Warriors in tanking gear up until Naxx. All that taken into account, Druids might actually be the very best 5man tank out there.
---
Grinding leather is very easy as a Druid too ; the DPS in Cat Form is far from being shit against single target mobs, you got anti Beast CC in case of trouble, Bear Form can be used in case of unexpected packs, Aquatic Form and Stealth if you want to avoid gank or go to exotic spots. Plus, and it's the most important thing there, you have pretty much 0 downtime. When you're low on life after killing a mob, you'll just heal yourself, and the time an other mobs takes your health down, your mana will have come back.  Great, really.
---
As for World PvP, Druids can outlast or outrun pretty much anything, but it's a war of attrition and can be a very boring playstyle. It's also a very, very high skill-cap class in PvP. IMO, the highest of all Vanilla classes, and quite far ahead of Hunts/Locks which would get 2nd spot. Getting out of Bear Form against a rogue/warrior in the wrong moment is often a death sentence, you'll have to play with the environment to use your long healing spells, do a lot of mana management as Polymorphing is the worse mana sink in the game, have a good reaction time for Morphing to the right form before/after CCs/Snares, etc. But it sure is very rewarding when you win flawlessly against relatively geared/skilled opponents.
---
FALSE, Grind to 5 on your alt, then acrue 2.5 lvls of rested exp while lvling your main, grind to 8/ 9with quests and repeat the cycle, you will get your alt to 60 much faster because grinding becomes 250% more efficient. also with a farming main you can hit 60 much faster and start your alt with big bags and potential fiery weapon enchants 
---
They've said in various discussions they're working with a modified Legion client so 7.something.  Which they may or may not being tweaking depending on what features they feel might not be appropriate for classic.
---
So I would expect most addons that worked in Legion to work in classic.
---
Wow, that's handy!  Not class-specific, so I'm not going to include it here, but definitely bookmarking it for my own reference.
---
The Vanilla healbot lets you just push 1 button and it automatically selects the lowest health target, calculates their missing health, and picks the correct rank of heal to top them off efficiently. I'm pretty sure they removed the ability to do some of that.
---
There is a private server guild who raids 1 day per week and clears every bit of content in that time. They do it on a Saturday I believe and the raid schedule is like 8 hours or something.  
---
I actually love the idea personally. 1 raid day then 6 days do whatever you want.  
---
It did in classic from my experience. I played a troll priest most of the time.
---
Chuck norris says what
---
Every single day someone posts this. You will find a guild where you can do this, but quit trying to shame others for wanting to optimize their own gameplay experience.
---
I thought windfury didn't proc in bear form or is that just a myth?
---
You can't run ZG with two characters is the point I was inferring.  You can't load up 10 characters on both accounts and 20 man raid.
---
There, that should fix it.  Thanks!
---
Server names, I want to be able to plan out what server me and my friends will be on
---
Pretty arrogant reply, given you clearly have no knowledge of the subject.
---
Right click reporting is abused in retail in many ways:
---
1) Rated Battle Grounds: If one team right clicks and reports an enemy player (Usually Flag carrier) for language or cheating - That player is instantly removed from the RBG &amp; unable to login for hours to days. Giving the reporting team a massive advantage.
---
2) Raids &amp; dungeons: Similar to RBG's, but can be used to bully and kick someone out. 
---
3) Players can become muted for days for an unrightful reason &amp; will be unable to contact other players because of this. Since Classic is actually an MMO and communication/interaction with others is key to success, this has major implications. 
---
Watch this video:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/an8jpd/the\_rightclick\_report\_feature\_as\_it\_stands\_could/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/an8jpd/the_rightclick_report_feature_as_it_stands_could/) 
---
Again, not sure why the arrogant tone. Try googling for 2 minutes before bashing people. - You should be right click reported for toxicity.
---
I’ll just hijack this to let people know that ‘early’ endgame, such as MC, ZG and arguably BWL is more accessible than you might think, especially when dungeons with more powerful gear comes out such as Dire Maul - and the general dungeon overhaul. I’d urge anyone who has interest to try to get a little into it. You’ll learn it faster than you think. 
---
I’m only referring to dealing with the Zerg of new characters back to back days. 
---
Can you link the source to that? Not joking btw. I really do need it.  
---
Holy crap, this is incredible.  What a great idea!  I'm happy to post it as it stands--would you rather I wait until your finished?
---
Since i mainly pvp, spiders are my bitches
---
Is there something that makes a Hunter good at that?  Lets say could a mage or druid also do those bosses?
---
Also note that this is not just a theory crafter. He and his guild are actually testing their stuff to achieve maximum efficiency and clear speeds.
---
July 16. Bet on Osconty.
---
I kind of agree. Skinning would help out for money, but I think getting ahead of the curve is more imporant. But I am prepping to be one of those button smashers day one ;). I feel like i will still have plenty of money from leveling, questing, and being smart with my skill purchases that ill be able to get my mount by 40-45 and it wont make too much of a difference. 
---
A lot of people don't seem to understand the difference between the LFG Tool and LFD/LFR.
---
I would definitely like to see the LFG Tool added, it simply works a lot better for forming groups.  It doesn't have any of the automation/porting etc... it's just a better way to see and join groups.
---
The human soul may have an infinite amount of lives, but you gotta make 'em all count as if they'd be your last.
---
You just gotta go real hard big fucking dick, Billy.
---
I mean there are lots of ways to make money, depends on the server though..  if linen/wool cloth are going for high enough, you can farm lower level dungeons and get those to sell (for people leveling to level their tailoring / first aid quickly).  Or get mining / herbalism and go farm mats.   use your tradeskills like maybe alchemy for potions / transmutes.  tailoring for bags / mooncloth.  enchanting for DE'ing for people for tips any enchants you have.   make mage portals for people and charge for them.
---
If you want best gold per hour then in the open world you'll probably have competition unless you get there before everyone else.  
---
You could AoE farm mara, and I think you can do that while leveling too and grind gold while you farm and level.
---
Lol. Respectfully selfish for not sharing strats ;)
---
Like the sound of this. I am probably not as experienced as you guys, but not inexperienced either. Let me know if you find anything like that, looking for a close knit group like that to play with.
---
You can certainly post it now, I'll just add a note to the site that says its still under development. Thanks for the kind words! :D
---
Pet aggro management, kiting, feign death for safe resets being the #1 reason
---
Did you see the good dam stats on that thing it should be an epic!!
---
Awesome, thanks!  I'll include them now.
---
I think youre projecting because I never mentioned min/maxing. I said people should pick their class based on playstyle, not what "tier sets are BiS and so they get to wear them". The guy I was replying to is considering min maxing in his class choice. I said thats stupid. You literally glazed over it because I have downvotes you stupid fuck.
---
you'd know by the names in the list if it was you sorry mate :/
---
It did in vanilla from your experience. 
---
Classic =/= vanilla.
---
If you do decide to opt for two characters and account, then I agree with your specialization choices; Engineering is a no brainer to have on your main, and having access to mining, herbalism *and* Alchemy is ideal and makes sense. 
---
My one suggestion would be to switch Alchemy with herbalism on your Rogue. Using your Mage to craft the potions shouldn't matter. 
---
My reasoning for having access to herbalism on your Rogue, ie. your main, is because when you're out traveling in the world, be it running to dungeons, raids, world PvP or what have you - you'll chance upon the occasional Black Lotus or other valuable herbs you couldn't otherwise pick. Think about how many times you'll be out traveling on your main for whatever reason as opposed to actively having to log on your farm character everytime you want to farm. The extra little trickle you'll get from having access to a gathering profession on the character you actually spend the most time on is well worth it in the end.
---
I want to say it was in the dev water cooler and they brought it up again at blizz con.
---
Ill dedicate all my playtime to classic.  Just on a pserver to scratch that itch till release. 
---
Thanks man
---
Depends which Lupos they decide to have in the game. Will all pets be normalized? If so I will have to rethink playing a hunter.
---
Southern Hemisphere BTFO
---
Ouch... Did noorrrrrr know that you can train skills from him... Lol
---
If you're not going to raid then do whatever you want who cares lmao.
---
So 24?
---
I was shocked to have this happen and even more shocked to see this comment being the top. You know a game is fucking good when you remember everything else surrounding it just as fondly.
---
Or we're the biggest nerds ever... either way, JIMMAY!
---
&gt; Going from private servers where you can pretty much chain turn-in world buffs to Classic where Onyxia's head can only be turned in 2 or 3 times a day (I think?) will also be a rude awakening for some.
---
There is going to be a lot less raiding guilds on each individual server than there are now on a mega server with 5 times the population cap of original vanilla, 7 continents gathered at the same place with their own timezones and raiding hours. Hence the cooldown is going to be less of an issue than most people like to fantasize it will be on this subreddit because it's trendy to hate on pservers for some reason.
---
The most important thing most people don't realize/know is that you can pop Rallying Cry of the Dragon Slayer with a Nefarian Head even if an Ony head is already up there on a pike ([source](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.7.0)). While it is likely that Ony PUGs will mess with the cooldown, it's a lot less likely that any PUG will kill Nefarian, or at least not often enough to make this separate cooldown an issue.
---
My feeling is that most guilds will organize with each other to pop a Nef head for everybody before prime time on reset night and not care the rest of the week. Now obviously that won't work before BWL is released but nobody needs RCDS/WCB to clear MC.
---
Lack of availability? What do you mean? Like not taking the time off work or something? 
---
I agree it would be considered more of a soft launch. I doubt many people would be hitting 60 in 3 days 7 hours, maybe a few of the hard hard core people, but not a ton.  
---
I dont think it would push people away from the game either. The people that are going to play classic are going to play classic, and then even more so on normal launch day because they want to see what the hype is about.  
---
Even if you had a 2 week "soft launch" or a week soft launch.... Youd have a couple people on each server possibly be 60 but a majority would be in the 30-50 range and then the gates open up and there is still a HUGE influx of people 1-30. Sure those people that didnt pay 50 dollars last year to get in on the demo don't get to start at the same time. Shit life isn't fair. lol.. Not saying this is happening, I just dont think of it as a bad idea.
---
YOU are the one min maxing and dont even realize you dolt! Everyone can wear their fucking tier sets, you are just blinding following BiS lists to figure out which classes are optimal in the Raid tier sets and choosing your class soley on a min maxing standpoint rather than choosing your class based on playstyle, lore or flavor (the exact thing youre suggesting I am being a nazi about). GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR SHITTY ASS YOU STUPID FUCK.
---
Possibly interested. I am a Horde Priest (Warrior Alt) on east coast time. Looking for something where I can see all the content but not over the top hardcore.
---
Yeah those human zones hit me right in the Nostalgia. Especially duskwood, that place felt so dangerous with all the worgen and stitches.
---
I know I don't need one, but I want to buy one just so I can have a physical copy. My question is: Will I get my 30 days even tho I already bought it one year ago?
---
Absolutely classic. I loved the "Unforgotten Realms" series he started on escapist a little after this stuff too.
---
&gt;Your argument is that private servers are so inaccurate that strategies like hamstring kiting won't be viable. 
---
That's the issue. That's not my only argument. Again, hamstring kiting being meta is just one example.
---
The point I'm trying to make is that private servers are inaccurate, and we cannot treat private server meta as the new meta that will be optimal on Classic. 
---
Because a lot of private server meta is based off of incorrect and estimated values.
---
&gt;Okay, my point is, what incorrect values are you specifically referring to? What is wrong which makes hamstring kiting impossible? What is it "compensating" for? Be more specific.
---
In my post, I highlighted what seems to be incorrect calculation of hit percentage, from my anecdotal experience. At the end of the day, finding this answer would be near impossible, because blizzard doesn't even have the same core information that was used during Vanilla. No one does. 
---
So I will agree, that we don't *know* how classic will be handled. The point I'm making, however, is that we *do know* that private servers are not correct, and we cannot expect Classic to be like them, because they used guess work.
---
If you want resources on what guess work, I know its touched upon in the many interviews with those that put put Nost together.

&gt;2) Yes, some strategies exist on private servers that didn't exist on the original servers. This isn't because things are so much different there, but because it's 15 years in the future and players are just better at the game. People used terrible gear back in the day too, that doesn't mean that that's "more correct" than the optimized BIS lists that people follow on private servers.
---
Yes and no. Hamstring kiting CAN be optimal in specific situations, I agree with that. I know its inherit benefit in PVP when its possible. 
---
I'm not saying its not viable. What I am saying is that it has emerged has the meta for leveling because other values of the private server are making the experience even more difficult for warriors in particular.
---
Warriors are meant to get hit, it is part of their class -- and they have the abilities to mitigate that damage. The meta of *avoiding* damage emerged because warriors take *too much* damage, because the tuning on the private server is not correct. Again, my anecdotal experience is seeing this in hit % not being correctly calculated, as well as aggro ranges and increased spawn rates making pulling individual mobs more difficult.
---
&gt;ople used terrible gear back in the day too, that doesn't mean that that's "more correct" than the optimized BIS lists that people follow on private servers.
---
Yes it can, if the math that dictates BiS on private servers is not the same math that dictated BiS on Vanilla servers.
---
That's what it comes down to, at the end of the day. Everything is based on math. And if the math is wrong, the experience will be different.
---
Nothing that happened with EQ is relevant, either. There are so many thousands of variables that go into meta, including private server tuning and adjustments, that you cannot compare the two games in anyway.
---
Which leads me back to my primary point, you can't expect Private Server meta to work in Vanilla or Classic meta, because the math and therefore physical playstyle will differ.
---
Again, a bug that has informed play style is equipping a quiver in a ranged slot for spellcasters to gain extra crit. That literally won't happen in classic, because that's not how classic will be programed to work.
---
If a BiS item is chosen as BiS because the way agility increases crit is calculated wrong, then it probably won't be BiS on the vanilla server.
---
So, when we put together resources and guides, we need to be careful about what information we are basing the meta and insight off of.
---
Why
---
I feel this. I was Alliance in Vanilla, and Horde every expansion afterward. Horde for life, but Ironforge and it’s proximity to Blackrock Mountain are so tempting. 
---
I'm thinking 50-100 per shard will be a likely deal.
---
Who was toxic? I called you a noob for choosing class based on BiS gear rather than flavor and playstle. Then you suggested I was a filthy min maxing elitist asshole. You are toxic AF and cant handle being called a noob. Lul.
---
I have two major issues with your proposa.
---
1. Your perception of the difficulty and boring factor of raiding is skewed because you have been playing on private servers. Someone who has not been actively raiding MC for the past year will have a much different perspective on how difficult or boring raiding is.
---
2. You claim that an extra night of 3-4 hours of raiding is better than spending that time farming for consumables. The major difference is that you can farm consumables by yourself any time, and you can even break it up into multiple 30 minute segments. Raiding, on the other hand, needs 40 people to agree on a day and time to show up for a block of 3-4 hours. Also it does not take 3 hours/week to farm consumables.
---
I know. But if they don't make a physical box or anything, will 30 days of game time still be added to my account from the battechest even though I already bought one previously?
---
Yeah, I do love cat pets. I won't worry about it then. I'll get my boar/bear when I have 2 stable slots.
---
Had me until Friday night! Thought I found the perfect match...
---
21st would be perfect. last day of work before my 5 weeks off.
---
Jesus kill me now.  Why are there so many stupid people in this reddit????
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!
---
Hi, /u/Simpkin90
---
You realize OP is min maxing by asking what classes use their tier pieces.. Everyone can use their tiers, OP is literally asking about which classes tier gear is "used" meaning optimal. Get it? Please get it :(
---
Lol what kind of comment is this? Plenty of people in NA and EU who can’t afford subs too. Why would only NA and EU players age? Your thought process is mindboggling. 
---
More than likely, I couldnt say for sure though. My pet tanks almost all the damage, and some of the bosses do quite a bit of damage. Also, you have to get by a lot of other mobs to get to these bosses, likely with the druid, not so likely without pulling aggro with the mage, I think some mobs silence in there as well. Hunters can feign death anything in there and lose aggro.
---
this is awesome. i remember the first time i did got to this boss and saw the it form and was so blown away.  great memories
---
Starting out as Nelf hunter, owl is a meme and takes too long to kill anything, you also have to go all the way to westfall to get screech which is a timesink, (faster to quest to 20's with a cat in darkshore+ashenvale)   
---
then you can get into a fast DM group for the westfall tunic and breeze through green westfall quests and easier redridge quests to get to Gnomer by 29 for the biS legs and waterbreathing staff  until you hit the late 30's and 40's where you can steal scarlet gear + ravager axe from warriors for maximum keks.   
---
will get a kitty and then at 20 get the ghost cat north of auberdine, at 42 ill get the rare white wind serpent in feralas and probably keep him because lightning does way more dmg pvp wise and he doesn't have caster stats. and is less likely to die in raids because I can have him stand still and cast lightning, while other hunters have wolves for the melee AP buff. also it is a white windserpent so he looks cool as fuck   
---
owl has better defense than the cat, especially with the screech debuff,  but way less dmg, screech will annoy the shit out of everyone around you in a dungeon,   
---
with an owl you can tank 2 mobs at once but they will still die slower than they would if you did it with a cat and healed your cat after.   
---
I am REALLY hoping they give hunters 5 stable slots (REEEE NO CHANGES fuck off...) adding stable slots does nothing to hurt gameplay and gives hunters something to collect other than all your loot. 
---
The non-raiding one
---
We have literally no clue how hard classic will be.
---
You mean you didn't buy Google at $5/share?
---
Good thing SS is instant
---
used to be my whole allowance.
---
As he said, i'd toss 15 bucks a month at almost anything.
---
IF is the best city.
---
Or you get all the way there and no one touches you.
---
Ah yea, I think they removed that with TBC. Those versions were a little too cheesey imo so it's best if they don't come back. 
---
About as viable as your ability to use the search function
---
Hey there. Sounds like we could be a good place to check out. Here is Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/XxazQfg
---
Pop in and say hi!
---
Realm names, and timezones. Bonus if we get population size
---
Master loot being removed from 5-man dungeons. All the complaints people had against loot trading, apply twice over to master loot. /s
---
Searching mankirk's wife. 
---
It depends on your class honestly. If you know what class you are playing we can probably tell you some optimal places. 
---
Hahaha thanks! Hard to believe i made my account 4 years ago. Feels like it were yesterday. Yeah I think I would be more relieved if it were a closed beta vs an open beta just because I wouldnt have the *urge* to play. 
---
if they throw in early registration of names with a pet for a collector's edition, blizz will print money.
---
still not sure that's what i want them to do though...
---
Yeah, sadly that's what people would be forced to do - either go on RP servers and try to engage in """""consensual""""" RPPvP events .. or get laughed at by everyone on a PvP server.........  
---
somehow I doubt the Classic devs would let it come to that.  Screw Ion and what he thinks is best, WE know what's best and the Classic team clearly listens.
---
Did they specify which summer...
---
Yeah I feel like I should play something Im not going to be playing when classic comes out but at the same time I dont want to because I want my first classic login to hit me like 8 trucks at once. If the servers hold up at launch...
---
I read that as Twenty-Firrth of June.
---
Streaming is less about the game and more about the person streaming, asmongold is the biggest "wow" streamer and he frequently gets around 20k+, sodapoppin used to stream wow and now he just streams random shit and still gets tens of thousands.
---
A lot of the top streamers have said they are going to stream classic, so for the first weeks it's almost certainly going to be one of the top games on twitch, if not THE top game.
---
Nobody watches these top streamers because of the game, they watch them for the personality.
---
Yeah, I had to cut a lot of quality stuff.  Any of those you just listed not on private server forums?  I'd love to include them here.
---
You are so horribly mistaken about the leveling speed. They're one of the best. Probably second only to Hunter.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this, and like I said to the other guy even if I'm the only one that uses it that's perfectly fine by me.  
---
Although I do think other simtools are awesome and hopefully have a team doing this stuff.. Vanilla has a surprising amount of complexity to the backend of things. Especially when you consider it and BC are the only version which "clipping" an auto had serious implications or serious upside, not to mention the ability to trinket swap mid fight, melee weave, or be a sp arcane shot hunter. I plan to add information here as well, not just have the calculation and gear selection. I'll have gear lists that change dynamically by phase, gear selector for resistance, pet lists, etc. My goal is to make it pretty much a one stop shop for theorycrafting hunter. Way more in-depth(assumed) than any "tool" that covers every class would be but hey if someone makes the exact same thing after me, I can only hope what I did helped them in the slightest bit.  
---
I have quite a bit to go before I am finished and I've already put in a lot of work. But to say it's a waste of my time is completely wrong. It's been time well spent!
---
has there ever been an oceanic rppvp server?
---
Can your farm character be your main? Mage for example? I want to pvp so I should do engineering and mining?
---
True. But its also still back and forth conversations on what faction/classes/and races all of my friends and I will be playing. So if I play at all it will lean me in a biased direction. 
---
&gt; • Warrior has a much easier time as a second character you can send some gold/gear too
---
Funneling gear to your warrior, as you level, will shave maybe 5-10 hours off your /played time.
---
At the cost of ~200 hours /played, to level your alt.
---
&gt; • I can come 1 shot stuff like the boss for whirlwind axe (I do plan on 2 accounts)
---
Just pay some lvl 50 dude 5g to kill that elite for you.
---
If you're leveling both characters, multiboxed, then sure, it makes sense.
---
Too bad they didn't add anymore FFA arenas after this one.
---
Doesn't the chest alo have a chance to drop a traveler's backpack?
---
H or A?
---
In that 1 second your tank is running in fear before someone reacts and dispels, the boss may turn direction and 1-shot four of your dps with one cleave or breathe fire on your entire raid.

---
I was never really fond of leveling in vanilla and am all about rushing to 60, but I do love Duskwood. 
---
Just got a flashback from your post. 
---
you dont need 40 alliance, you use to be able to pull horde leaders out of the city, and kill them in 5 man groups. We use to take him to a little cave a little ways away from thunder bluff
---
probably. Maybe there is some weird spell like eye of kilrogg or something.
---
Ah ok, so your method depends on skipping bosses
---
Told you it wasn't possible
---
Except for shroud.  He's amazing at any FPS he plays but he's got about as much personality as a bottle of shampoo.
---
I agree with you though.  Now that I think of it, "Just Chatting" is usually one of the highest watched content types so you can definitely say it's not about the game.
---
I'm excited to see what happens
---
I can't remember it dropped a taveler's backpack. If it did, it was probably a very very small chance, like the same chance it would drop from a random world drop.
---
Follow me for a second.
---
In 1.12 we had all the raids released, but we are getting them phased correct? They should release all the raids upon release because it will be true to 1.12 right? 
---
Now see how dumb you sound when you say shit like that about xrealm bgs?
---
&gt;Funneling gear to your warrior, as you level, will shave maybe 5-10 hours off your /played time.
---
Much more time shaved then funneling stuff to a mage, no?  
---
&gt;Just pay some lvl 50 dude 5g to kill that elite for you.  
---
If I'm leveling the warrior first, I'll be one of the higher levels on the server. *Maybe* a hunter or warlock gets 20 levels ahead of me, but they wouldn't stop leveling to come kill an elite for 5g if they are taking leveling that serious.
---
Spiders don't have the web in vanilla unfortunately :(
---
Little me at 12 years old did not have his own PC and did not pay his sub himself. Now I can. This is regarding the demographic of US and NA players, this has nothing to do with chinese and eastern europeans and their ability to pay or not. I'd say the vast majority of people playing videogames in the US/EU will be able to pay 15$ per month for gaming. It's like 2 beers less a month in scandinavian countries.
---
Having 900$ GDP per capita indeed has an impact on how many people will be able to afford the game +rig. In this regard there will be less people with the ability  to cough up the money to pay for the subscription and possibly for a new PC as classic is a lot more taxing than vanilla was.
---
&gt;Aside from a release date
---
Cheater!
---
I'll be controversial, I'd desperately like to hear that they are going to re balance the raids, MC, BWL, and ZG especially to get them more in line with their original difficulty, or at least make it so they aren't zerg fests.
---
Also, if the release really is going to be this summer, I'm getting more and more worried we haven't heard anything about a beta, as right now we are looking at a fairly short beta.
---
Never played hunter but why isn't anyone using a bear?
---
They're cute as hell.
---
Sounds good, I'll include it now
---
every time I hear "summer" in relation to video games, I always assume it means the school year "summer", the time between Memorial Day and Labor Day. 
---
Because that's when the kids are out of school and have hours upon hours to play video games.
---
Haven't decided yet. I've mained Horde for 14 years or whatever on Retail... so probably Alliance? Since I never played that before.
---
I'd personally like at least two mounds of realms.
---
Yes we do since we played it lol!
---
I've never really watched him but from what I've seen he does seem rather tame, but he seems to be the exception.
---
I played classic wow right up until BCcame out.  I never tried bc and quit then.  I played on archimonde server with a banging guild called oinland and we got first bwl and cthun on our server.   We also had a blast doing pvp together.
---
I absolutely loved the game at the time and I tried playing during pandaria and dreamed of playing vanilla again.  Never played a private server though so I'm beyond stoked for this.
---
Right sorry!
---
&gt;I was shocked to have this happen and even more shocked to see this comment being the top
---
this
---
Do not return thinking you can relive all of your past memories.
---
Return because you know it will be great creating knew ones.
---
Mainly bugs, there are going to be plenty, this is an entirely new project/game, it needs to be tested, and as we are already at the end of March, we'll be lucky to see much of a beta at all at this point.
---
I think addons played a big part in wow becoming this popular. Everybodies Ui looked different and I want it to be the same this time around also. The free dome that comes with the addons is huge.
---
the trick to farming is to not pick the weeds
---
Personally, I'm expecting it to launch at 1:49 pm mountain time on Sept. 23rd. That gives Blizzard a full 26 seconds of wiggle room/plausible deniability.
---
Let the plebs farm, and reap the rewards in auction house trading.... that is my jam.
---
I do barrens to 25, 1k needles to 31 or 32, and then to 38 or 39 in shimmering flats while mixing it up with some STV now and then. 
---
I prefer grinding over questing though and I’d say ~85% of my xp is from grinding. Not sure that will be as viable on launch because of low level zones being overpopulated. 
---
WPL is a 60 second mount ride away from that elite, plenty of lvl 50 people there.
---
Unless you are going to be playing 12 hours/day, there will definitely be a hunter or a mage that's 15 levels above you, and can solo the boss.
---
The original claim was "doing strat live in 20 mins"
---
Skipping bosses is not "doing strat live"
---
Yes. Siberia will not have access to World of Warcraft because it is too cold.
---
&gt;Roleplaying and PVP roleplaying are two completely different things
---
Yes, and it's possible to want both. RP where people run around in their own bubbles of "safety" where they don't have to flag PvP is kind of gimp. It's possible to have the PvP element and RP at the same time, or not. 
---
Compared to a Hunter everything is slow, that's true enough.
---
I was going to mention deadmines but it’s not too bad of a run there if you take zeppelin to STV and jump and swim to west fall. 
---
Right, obviously benefits and all, I just say they have to because barrens is a very not visually appealing zone for me. I never took to the dry desert/savana zones much and after 10 levels in barrens i find myself pushing pretty hard just to get to a different scenery, that’s all.
---
Reminds me of Summer of 1999.
---
I bowed to do absolutely nothing but chillax that summer and that is exactly what I did. I remember video games and Cartoon Cabana 
---
Yeah. It's actually more like "people who are good at the game are actually bad at the game because they try too hard".
---
Druids are known to be able to do the goblin and Rottgrip. 
---
Druids however have a slightly harder time with princess vs some other classes like Hunters or Warlocks
---
The whole assumption was based upon doing strat live for *farming*. Why would I want to do Skul or Canoneer if it diminishes my gold per hour? 
---
Summer is in 67 days as of today bro. 
---
Feels like it may be [Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9492), drop from Mekgineer Thermaplugg, last boss in Gnomeregan. 
---
actually yeah why do u think so many people play alliance?
---
Only able to accrue 1.5 levels restedexperience. 
---
Game time is game time, regardless as to where you get it from. If your retail subscription is active, you’ll be able to play classic 
---
I was a MT in vanilla (up to 4H - we stalled out).  What he says checks out based on my memory.  As my gear improved, I focused more and more on threat generation and adjusted my spec and play-style accordingly.
---
In terns of incoming damage, mitigating damage in general wasn't really the big deal - it was avoiding crushing blows.  *Steady* incoming damage actually improved your tanking ability via improved threat generation.
---
Playing WoW with 400 ping is the true Vanilla oceanic experience.
---
...why is he a chump?  I don't understand your hostility.
---
Probably rolling paladin/shaman healer LFG, prefer early/daytime raids 2 weekdays 1 weekend schedule for semi HC raiding guild. Havent seen too many raids between 1pm CST - 9pm CST.  Work early mornings so afternoons early evenings are best for me
---
Unless you are a shaman and get to go fetch your water totem for about 3 hours all over the world at level 20.
---
&gt;  The whole #nochanges bullshit is coming from people who never played vanilla
---
Pretty sure you’re trolling at this point
---
https://github.com/tomrus88/BlizzardInterfaceCode/blob/classic/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_TalentUI/Blizzard_TalentUI.toc
---
The interface version of the extracted UI files from the demo client is set to 70300 aka 7.3.5 (there's no 70350, it always goes 70000, 70100,  70200, etc). They also said it in a video somewhere.
---
It's possible they'll upgrade it to the bfa client though, since it has recently 
---
gotten multicore + directx12 support. I doubt they want to miss out on that.
---
Oh. I'm really sorry then. I totaly missunderstood your post. Sometimes it's a lttle bit hard to understand every intention as non nativ speaker. Please take my apology.
---
I applaud your enthusiasm, I have no doubts you'll make this a great tool that a lot will use. 
---
&gt; well, they kinda ruin the challenge aspect of the game.
---
Maybe it's not the case for you, but I feel like most of these sentiments are actually just thinly veiled whines because you're lazy and don't want to put in the work to prepare for raids.  But you know saying that would make you look bad, so instead you try to flip it around and act like you're just a more macho raider that wants a bigger challenge.
---
"All classes can do strat:live in a 5men guild group with a treasurer who sells the high selling items and shares by 5.
---
Yes, it is. You can do strat live with starter gear with people you 100% trust in 17-20minutes per run."
---
Was your original quote.
---
Yes the context was doing strat live for farming, but in the context of 60g an hour.
---
What I originally had issue with was the 17-20 minutes part by people in starter gear.  It's bullshit, absolute bullshit and here's why:
---
a) "strat live in 17-20 minutes" does not mean skipping bosses.  Skipping bosses is not a "strat live run"
---
b) The suggestion that all 5 people of the group can get 60g an hour is also bullshit, that is dependent on getting lucky with non orb high value drops.
---
c) Orbs are random, some runs I've seen every person get one each, sometimes some people get more than run.  I've never had a run where everyone got two.  I've had runs where only 1-2 dropped.
---
Strat live isn't a reliable gold farming method unless you're a tank and you can reserve the first orb.
---
If you can legitimately do Strat live from the side entrance to finish without skipping any bosses in starter gear in under 20 minutes then I'll pay for your first months wow classic subscription
---
Until then you're full of shit
---
No not at all. If you're not raiding with consumables (unnecessary as a casual) and respeccing constantly, what do you really need boatloads of money for? Epic mount is really the only major thing. You can get some gold from just naturally playing the game - quests, dungeons, professions, etc. If you really need money you can farm with a shaman. Yeah it'll be slower than a hunter, but it won't add up to 200+ hours of gold farming, which is what it takes to level another 60. 
---
Alternatively, learn to play the AH. Richest guy I knew in Vanilla was a healer who never respecced and barely left Org between raids. 
---
It definitely has it's best use on farm runs. Can't say as I know much (anything) about Fury-Prot but in WoTLK DW Frost was the thing that kept me tanking for smaller, progressing guilds long after my first guild had downed LK Heroic. At a certain point I think the alternative to keeping it fresh is burning out.
---
I love this website.  I haven't made contact with any old guildies yet but I do recognize a handful from my old server.
---
Lack of availability as in it would be invite-only and not everyone who wants in can get in.
---
If it's just open for all or a purchasable beta, then there's not really a point to it imo. Just have a "normal" beta and wipe characters afterwards if they are to have one. The beta phase is to stress-test, find/fix bugs and collect data after all.
---
I agree that not a lot of people would be 60, and far from many would be even 30 in a week, but it still neglects some of the race aspects to a fresh launch. Not a lot of people take racing to 60 seriously, but it's still exciting to witness the progress of the ones who do hit it live, instead of a belated "gz" as they log in.
---
Life isn't fair, but we can still try to make the things we do in life as fair as we can. I don't see a point to do it this way, sounds worse than sharding. Sharding still lets you play with friends from the start, but if you're level 28 and your friend is level 16? That's a big difference.
---
Honestly, if a guild wants to progress through AQ 40, your mages are going to start pulling tons of threat from being fire spec.   
---
Skarm might be fury spec from the start of server, fury for the first MC clear because that is the type of guild he is in.   
---
But if you are in even a semi-hardcore guild, you will start feeling the limits of a Shield Slam spec around BWL/AQ40 time.
---
What frustrates me is the number of people who think these things are mutually exclusive. I like to go into a game with no knowledge at all, then optimize from scratch. Why use someone else's BIS list or class guide when I can figure it out myself?
---
I mean Orc Racial also increases threat but Berserking scales with all your other dps stats and procs thunderfury more so yea its better.
---
Suck a dick buddy, nobody cares. Also, I'm not a minmaxer so yeah.. nice internet psychology degree you got there. 
---
Skarm mentioned not using Sunder after 5 stacks, and using Heroic Strike as much as possible instead. I can understand this for dual wilding with the rage generation, but I think he referred to it for shield tanking, too. I know a big motivation is that Heroic Strike gets rid of potential Glancing Blows. However, it also gets rid of white swing rage generation. I think in pservers, rage generation from damage taken is too high. Is this something that when Classic comes out with proper rage generation, that it won't be the case to use Heroic Strike over Sunder Armor? In terms of additional threat generated, they're about even (Heroic Strike a but higher), but for threat per rage Sunder is definitely higher.
---
Yes, 100% this.
---
Depends on the server, but it was 20 minute respawn on Ana/LB
---
I think that Skarm has much more of a clue than you do. Why are you calling him a chump? I guarantee he is far more skilled than you at this game. 
---
It'll be a Tuesday, so the 25th is more likely. The FFXIV expansion is on July 2nd with early access in the week before, so my money is on June 25th.
---
I just found out that you can have only one battechest per account, so if I were to buy one again, I wouldn't get any game time:(
---
What is free weekend?
---
But why on earth would you want to not skip bosses if it increases the gold? I genuinely do not understand. Are you doing semantics here? A dungeon is done, when the endboss is dead.
---
In DM:E in 99% of the runs the imp is being skipped, in RFK in 99% of the runs Roogug is skipped, in WC in most cases the fairy dragon is skipped, in Maraudon Landslide is skipped failry often. Does this means all these dungeons arent done, because you skipped a boss that does not yield promising loot? Are you not finishing AQ20, because nobody is interested in Ayamiss? Nobody does content that results in no advantage, in this case the advantage is gold. By skipping canoneer, gold increases, because you have more shots at truefaith.
---
well will u actually pvp much? like go for higher than rank8 or even 10?
---
if not then u dont really need engi
---
I mean you're also mortal striking yourself while main tanking soo
---
Pretty sure it's too little, too late. 
---
TBH, what comes after Naxx. If we do or don't have BC, it changes what my class will be for vanilla. 
---
I really hope WoW classic gets the burning crusade, that was my favorite version of WoW.
---
Since the majority of pservers will close, I guess it's kind of stupid and risky to keep playing them.
---
LOL I forgot it did that
---
Yeah he didn't elabore enough on that to make sense to me either, especially since SA increases raid dps.

The exact numbers are secondary to the concept.  If the primary cap of raid DPS is threat generated by the main tank, once you achieve enough effective health and HPS to not get dropped by the boss, your focus should be on improving threat generation.  Rage mechanics then mean that you can improve DPS/TPS by taking more damage.  
---
Wish somebody had told me sooner...I’m gonna miss it though...
---
Parkour is what did it for me, but I will try to go outside more! Thanks
---
Yeah no point going fury for the firsts MC run that's for sure.
---
We are few.  We are here, though.
---
Yes, that is probably the biggest draw for Alliance, but compared to all of the others that Horde is way better for, it's worth the pain of that swim to do VC.
---
&gt; The original claim was "doing strat live in 20 mins"
---
&gt; Skipping bosses is not "doing strat live"
---
definitely gnome for pvp
---
"I think in pservers, rage generation from damage taken is too high. "  
---
Do you have ANY source at all for this. Or is this literally just a thing that you "think"?  
---
The amount difference in leveling is far smaller than the amount of difference in endgame PvE. Blessing of Salvation means your entire raid can pump out 30% more threat worth of damage without pulling aggro, which is an absolutely gigantic advantage.
---
extra brownie points if u do it as a dwarf dispeling his dots
---
You don't really have to try with some of the bigger bosses, just wait till after they smack ya then pop it before a heal comes ;)
---
It wasn't that way in Vanilla and shouldn't be the case in Classic.
---
How is Skarm a chump? I mean if you want to call Tips, Esfand etc chumps I at least get that, but not Skarm. 
---
I don't know why they don't do more things like this? This could be the content they could add after they release classic WoW. With high loot items or gold. This was fun! 
---
Well you're still increasing raid dps - he said no more Sunder AFTER 5 stacks. But typically you're spending 15 rage for 260 additional threat for Sunder, and 15 rage for 283 additional threat for Heroic Strike. However, you're missing out on about 4-8 rage (correct me if I'm wrong) for every white swing you miss out on from using HS. Of course, there are MANY factors that complicate the math - like glancing your white hits, critting HS, etc. I plan on doing some really involved mathematical calculations on this topic soon, but I wanted to know if there's something Skarm knows that I'm not considering.
---
Also in the calculations I will identify threat per second, not just threat per rage. Because in some cases (tanking without a shield where rage gen is sufficient to spam HS, or other cases) you care less about rage efficiency and need as much threat ASAP
---
It does indeed have a low chance: 1.7%
---
http://classicdb.ch/?object=179697
---
It was not.  Until level 10, only things at or above (your level -4) give xp, and I think that increases by 1 every ten levels, so 5 and up at level 10, 14 and up at level 20, 23 and up at level 30, etc.  
---
Okay, so we can agree to disagree. 
---
It'll be ok.bjust go find your safe place where none of the mean trolls can hurt you or say something you might not like.
---
The other people below already explained it.
---
in 5mans it depends on the role u joined as
---
were u in bear/cat ? then u pass
---
Really what it is is all these blizzard fanboys that refuse to play on private servers, probably because they were too bad for their guild to give them gear.  They have their precious memories of Vanilla as it was and desperately cling to the idea that they will be good at Classic because they played Vanilla.  They want to believe that private server players aren't going to completely kick their ass when Classic comes so any time they see something from a private server they put their hands over their ears and say "lala not listening".   
---
People literally say things like "You will get one shot by Luci if you try to tank without 440 defense". All because their shitty tank did  in their shitty guild in Vanilla when everyone was shit. These people are not rational.  
---
Really, they are just shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Odds are I will make my banks first, then my mains name. I am not too worried about my main name being taken.
---
Wasn't true then. Won't be true.
---
Vanilla XP rates had a "Zero Difference" element.
---
- ZD =  5, when Char Level =  1 -  7
---
- ZD =  6, when Char Level =  8 -  9
---
- ZD =  7, when Char Level = 10 - 11
---
- ZD =  8, when Char Level = 12 - 15
---
- ZD =  9, when Char Level = 16 - 19 
---
- ZD = 11, when Char Level = 20 - 29
---
- ZD = 12, when Char Level = 30 - 39
---
- ZD = 13, when Char Level = 40 - 44
---
- ZD = 14, when Char Level = 45 - 49
---
- ZD = 15, when Char Level = 50 - 54
---
- ZD = 16, when Char Level = 55 - 59
---
Meaning: When you're Level X, mobs ZD levels below you don't grant XP.
---
@ Level 30, mobs 18 and lower give no XP.
---
And the XP scales a lot during that ZD gap. At level 30, a level 30 mob will give 195xp. A level 19 mob technically gives XP, but it gives 92% less, only 16.
---
no, until there's actual evidence of you doing strat in 20mins you're just a bullshitter
---
I totally agree. Would have loved more things like this in later expansions as well. It's such a small little feature, which gives so much extra gameplay.
---
No 
---
For sure, but at least on private servers they /sit to get crit so they can pop it ASAP. Probably wont work on classic.
---
&gt;let´s wipe
---
that´s the spirit
---
Thanks for posting!
---
caps at 1.5levels over 10 days, which equals 75% "free xp"
---
I wonder why is it interesting to play classic for them? Retail has much more margin between good and bad players. Competing in classic is like children competing in sandbox, that's how it looks for me. But it's good to have fun for everyone, I guess, as long as their opinions are not imposed by others.
---
The demo client version doesn't necessarily indicate the release client version though.  
---
That’s strange. The barrens is one of my favorite zones. It always feels so alive with all the players running around 
---
During the Classic panel?  
---
I was a mage who did all of AQ 20 and 40 in the day without consumes. Some of our raid did, but our guild was never hardcore/strict. Have gear will take was our approach. It got us a lot of players who stuck around. 
---
He actually said he will occasionally sunder if everything else is on CD and he has the rage. 
---
Thanks. 
---
Thanks for making the website.
---
&gt;Comparing golf to Classic is a pretty far stretch, but I'm sure you get my point. Classic has captured the hearts of so many, but to the general masses it's still a boring slog of watching dudes hit stuff. 
---
Some would say it really depends on WHAT you stream while playing.
---
People have had success in the undocumented server streaming while streaming everything, even the boring stuff.
---
Others choose to farm off stream and engage in world PvP battles and try to rustle up large pvp battles in southshore.
---
Both have seen some measure of success and I think even the boring stuff, being able to participate in the journey of a high end character, especially since you don't need to actually DO all of it, can be very engaging w/ the right personality and good taste in music.
---
&gt; Too bad they didn't add anymore FFA arenas after this one.
---
Nobody remembers Dire Maul.
---
I ran a couple of Naxx bosses back in the day without consumes. Was it hard, fuck yes. But we did it.
---
the pvp blues for spriest are very good
---
Yes xrealm news for sure. Also, what is the macros functionality going to look like? I assume we can rest easy that it won't be the original ridiculous open scripting that turned developers into demi-gods. I remember my brother and I played ferals and he wrote an incredible one button macro that would utilize all of your abilities perfectly, exactly utilizing everything when it was most effective in terms of energy, combo points, buffs/debuffs, using your trinket but only if you were feared etc. You just had to mash one button for almost everything, it was great in pvp. I don't want those days to return.
---
That’s the trick. Basically only fight mobs at your level or lower. The xp gain for higher level mobs isn’t worth the added time and risk of dying.  
---
1h/day 240h to 60 casual... no
---
2h/day 120h to 60 casual... maybe
---
When the battlechest was a thing you couldn't buy a second one for the 30 days on the same account, you could for a different account.
---
Misleading title confirmed
---
I used to be part of this guild back in Vanilla on Shattered Hand. I never did any of this stuff though, just raided with them. 
---
I admit I forgot about that. But there was no event attached to it, was there?
---
I don't have a concrete source on hand. It's something I've read in pserver forums and on this subreddit a few times in my couple years of lurking vanilla theorycrafting, and I did the record exactly where. But it matches with my experience in retail vanilla and TBC. In TBC there were certainly moments I was capped on rage in raids and spamming everything, but certainly not every fight as what some pserver folks will have you believe - and I wasn't even wearing great mitigation gear, it was my alt tanking for my progression guild so I was under geared most of the time. In vanilla I only tanked up to about level 45, and I was definitely rage starved and certainly couldn't spam HS in dungeons, I mainly tanked with SA and Revenge - of course this is not taking damage from raid bosses so I understand I'm not fully knowledgeable about end game tanking in vanilla. But this is why I said I think, and why I asked the question at the end, hoping someone can shed some light on it.
---
I wouldn't call it a bias, i'd call it being more informed. Maybe you make a gnome (because its beta) and you find out after 10 levels you really don't mind being a gnome after all. You'd never have given it a shot if you started at launch, and then 5 years later you're a level 90 gnome warrior doing world firsts and crushing hoes with your giant worldkilling greatmaul of everlasting destruction +1.
---
I'm just saying, have whatever conversations you want, but the experience of playing adds a piece to the equation too.
---
Maybe.
---
We already established that our definitions of a completed run are different.
---
For me the endboss has to be dead. For you all dungeon bosses have to be dead to call it a full run. 
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
I've leveled quite a few hunters and Owl is the best for leveling/farming end stop.  
---
You won't notice the -3% dps at all.  You will notice the benefits of screech all day, every day. 
---
I usually use a boar for pvp
---
Boar is tanky, has charge and eats just about any type of food which makes it really handy for leveling.
---
If it still has the fastest attack speed, Broken Tooth for pvp. Starving mountain lion is the budget option, I believe.
---
If it still does shadow damage, Lupos for pve. Otherwise a wolf from LBRS is the go to for raiding (for highest rank furious howl) until the ZG wind serpent is available.
---
a hunter worried about money XD
---
You know you could roll and orc or troll and just run to mulgore, plus then you'd be closer to getting a kodo too
---
Apparently I don't haha - don't remember the DM arena at all.
---
In the case of Shroud people are still watching because it's Shroud and he's about as good as you can get at FPS in general
---
I have zero clue why everyone goes to EK over kalimdor as alliance. Darkshore is such an easy 11-18.
---
Thanks, I am also considering spriest pvp, but worried about the time investment and gear availability 
---
You will not survive Naxx without consumables.  Patchwerk and Thaddius are DPS (and heal) check fights, Loatheb requires everyone to use shadow protection potions or you die on the second doom, and Sapphiron and KT require you to chug frost protection or mana pots on cooldown.  If most of the raid isn't doing these things, you will not come close.  Even Anub'rekhan without consumes will be more difficult since your already squishy mages will have even less HP, and every one of them that dies will spawn 15\~ scarabs that need to be killed ASAP.
---
Druid and Shaman. Just saw a video about Duo Leveling by Kargoz and he breaks it down.
---
I’m playing a Mage! I’ve tried doing some research and the only farming spots I can find seems to be DM and ZG, where as hunters and wlocks can make a decent amout on Mara Princess runs. 
---
Doesn’t look like mages can find anything close to that pre DM.
---
Like others, I leveled both horde and Alliance to 60 in 2005/2006. Horde was a lot easier in my opinion. That being said, alliance was my first faction and the nostalgia is there when it comes to the cities and early zones. I pefer the horde races though so I'll probably end up being horde.
---
Lmgd *does* know his shit, though. I just doubt Tips got it out of him.
---
Pallys by a pretty large margin. Shamans best buff is windfury which druid gets nothing from. Kings + wisdom is really good for a druid.
---
Cool thanks! As spriest does that mean I should roll tailoring/mining to get some gear? And then switch to eng later on? 
---
A little birdie. 
---
They are not going to go backwards. Beside the stability and hardware advancements in the new client a lot of safety measures are a part of it as well.
---
And while the API might be the same as Legion there is a huge difference in how some addons can work such as leveling guide mods or databases since the quest database is different than most addons like Zygor currently have. Zygor has said they will look at the API and client once they are able to get into beta so they can see if they can convert their pre cata DB.
---
There is also a macro syntax change ( I think.I am foggy on when it happen. I missed legion till the last month and found out my old macros needed tweaking)
---
Wouldn't alc/tailor make more sense? Archanite and mooncloth?
---
Less rogues... I hope..
---
But only reasonably lower. At level 20, if you can kill a level 18-21 in reasonably similar times, go for the 21 for 5% more, not the 18 for 18% less.
---
the internet is a series of tubes, the wow classic data is thicc, therefore the tubes in russia are too cold to receive wow classic
---
sry comrade 
---
This is more for clearing endgame content. But will check out the vid, thanks.
---
Hope they push it back to sept, less school kids lol.
---
This item looks **sick**! What's the lightning shield like? 
---
This is a strange thought as I will instead be playing in Florida, where it'll be hot. So.... hot summer nights playing WoW, windows down (can't use AC ALL the time) in my new house with the wife.
---
When winter comes it won't even be cold, really. Oh my god, i'll never play WoW on a snow day ever again....... (grew up in new england)
---
If I’m understanding you correctly, you’re saying your guild will be mostly or entirely hybrids? If so, I’d say for sure shaman/Druid
---
One factor you might not have sufficiently considered yet is the diminishing returns. That’s where I would argue shamans shine more than paladins. The first eight shamans in a raid are all welcome. The first 2 paladins in a raid are welcome. Additionally, I would argue that the dps spec for shamans is better than that of paladins. 
---
I also agree that shamans and druids have more in common than shamans and paladins. (though that gets confusing once we add retarded space goats, but for vanilla and prior it holds up certainly). 
---
I tested this in the demo. It did nothing, and from what I understand, it never worked in official vanilla wow. 
---
Most people that are waiting for 1.5 year have come up with a leveling plan. 90% of those people will just do whatever thet want once the game is released.
---
regardless the starter gear 20 mins claim is bs too
---
Whats cold for you, 20c?
---
Do ferals not benefit? 
---
That might work for a small number of players, but a few people trying to farm up even basic consumables for an entire raid of 40 people is a lot more effort than you think.  Especially if it's for progression where those consumes are popped frequently.
---
Of course... But why not always Sunder, then HS occasionally have rage? I'm trying to think why HS is priority over SA. One reason would be that you can use HS with your other abilities (no global CD), but he doesn't use Shield Slam much, what else is left besides Revenge which is a long CD and requires a parry/Dodge? I tanked TBC in raids and I remember Sunder still being used a lot, perhaps the main ability. HS only when you have the rage.
---
Yes, City of Heroes and Final Fantasy 11 have expansion packs planned. Plus Halo 2 on June 1st.
---
Wait..... this isn't 2004!
---
I was curious too and started digging around. Short answer is no one really knows.  
---
I saw comments saying "they said it will be a server option in the retail client" but then when you dig in "they" are just incorrectly repeating speculation. Blizzard has actually not said anything about if Classic servers will just be a server type using the latest client, or a separate launcher from [battle.net](https://battle.net) using a modified fork from some other version. Beta was 7.3.5 because that was the version the dev team had been using when evaluating the 1.12 database migration and it was the easiest way to get a demo out for blizzcon. 
---
Likely just comes down to what faction you prefer to play. 
---
Either combo works in different ways.  A tank paladin has Kings which is the best Druid buff and a pure feral can rip things up. Or you could tank as feral while an elemental shaman nukes. Works either way.
---
Wolf form matches Druid travel powers better but Paladin can be immune to snares and can run a bit faster than normal to keep mobility even with druid. They get free mount too.
---
Both combinations are ridiculously versatile. 
---
No such thing ;)
---
&gt; Final Fantasy 11 have expansion packs planned. Plus Halo 2
---
To be fair... there _is_ the FF mmo expansion coming? And Halo MCC should be out this summer too... soo hahaha yeah.
---
It would be 100% druids and the other one, yeah. And good point re. diminishing returns.
---
It’s an advantage for sure, but horde tanks dish out more threat with windfury so it’s not quite 30%.
---
I think a big reason why most people avoid Kalimdor on the Alliance side is because of Deadmines being available. You can easily gather all the DM quests while leveling and a large majority of the population (dwarfs, gnomes and humans) are all very close and centralized. 
---
Darkshore, while I really enjoy the zone, is very large and requires a ton of walking to complete the quests. I don't think the zone is worth it to travel to if you're not a night elf. This all goes back to my original comment as to why the horde leveling is so much better than the Alliance and this is exactly why.
---
Why would you go into a horde territory if you don't to get ganked?
---
I prefer to play alone, don't like grouping with others.  Will I enjoy Classic?
---
Current wow is all about min maxing. 
---
What can you do to improve your dps, run the simulations on an external website or addon, see which gear fits you perfect for the moment, etc etc.
---
I don't mind it tbh, seeing how I'm not a dps, and healers generally can't sim their "rotation".
---
And if you want to min max Classic, be my guest. Don't expect everyone to go at your pace though (insert pikachu face here).
---
My first character was undead warrior..  started halfway through vanilla, ended up selling the account for $1200 for the now level 70 undead warrior with Gladiator title. I still regret putting you up for auction Ttoy, please forgive me 😞 
---
Oh, nice! What was your character's name?
---
Their white damage still is affected by it. It becomes significant when using Manual Crowd Pummeler. Kings seems to be considered the best  overall buff though.
---
No shut up he has more cool points than you ever will. 
---
Right click sure as hell did
---
What I have seen is that armor calculations on private servers are such that you end up doing more damage than you should to a boss with X armor. But also that some bosses have too much armor on private servers.
---
This works both ways I think. We are doing too much damage to the boss, and the boss is doing too much damage to us. This could be why we get more rage on private servers as you say. So the damage-&gt; rage conversion is not off, but the damage taken is off. Perhaps.
---
Now, my experience on private servers is similar to your own in that in early dungeons you feel extremely rage starved. I almost never had rage to heroic strike/cleave in a dungeon. If this private server is overtuned as you suggest, tanking in dungeons while leveling will be very tough and probably force people to go even harder on the whole "threat gear" thing. Both do you take more damage and get more rage and so you can gen threat with that rage.
---
But I want to say that despite not being able to use heroic strike in early dungeons, its still very spammable in raids. This makes sense if you think about it. You have 10x the healers of a 5 man. These things do tons of damage. Even if the rage calculation WAS a bit off, you would still have TONS of rage. With a 1.40 speed weapon, I can't even spend all my rage. Tanks are also  popping Deathwish and Recklessness now, greatly increasing dmg taken.  So I doubt this will be much different in classic, even if it is a bit off on private servers.  The one thing that will be different is /sit to get crit, which does get you alot of rage and threat on private servers. It especially helps with rage generation on trash where you aren't taking much dmg.
---
Part of choosing faction is learning which synergises better. And we're (hopefully) talking a 40-person raid :-)
---
&gt; They are not going to go backwards.
---
Are you trying to say I was suggested they'd go backwards in client version, or is this just some random suggestion thrown in?  
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with your message.  
---
As a mage like you, I was thinking with aoe farming I'd be able to farm gold for mount quite quickly so I wouldn't compromise on professions while leveling. I was thinking of going enchanting and tailoring and pursuing my dream of being a top enchanter on the server. 
---
Same!!!
---
So far this is my result as well. I haven't found a single source where Blizzard expressly said Classic will be based on the 7.3.5 client.  
---
So far the only "evidence" we have suggests the client would parallel with retail and update with retail.  
---
The general answer to raiding then is: always Alliance.
---

Hmm... One might think that the comparison isn't quite as clear-cut and lopsided as you might imply
---
Damnit thats right
---
Sorry, what I meant to ask was: are ret pally tanks viable? And how do I find BiS lists if I'm and idiot and don't know how to use Google? 
---
warriors got talents reworked later in vanilla
---
and classic will now start with lategame talents
---
Thats what you got out of everything I said?  Ok...
---
What I am getting at is we know the demo client does not equal release.
---
We are all trying to make educated guesses as to the API and code base mod authors will have to work with is all.

When you are fury spec, you need to pool rage to hit your Bloodthirst every CD. So you have less free rage to Sunder Armor. Heroic Strike can crit and give you lots of threat. With full world buffs, it's critting like 30% of the time. You have BIG damage with the way skarm gears/buffs/consumes/specs. You don't want that damage to miss.
---
You can look at some of his logs if you are curious,

But heres a Naxx where he only uses sunder 11 times all raid.

underappreciated song, used to have it on my phone by accident and ended up loving it
---
It was a long time ago but I think it was Malehcahr, a ret/holy paladin. Did you play on Shattered Hand? 
---
It's a bit less than a week before mine, but I'll take what I can get
---
I don't think they will be announcing realm size before launch or why it really matters. 
---
They never have focused on realm size in the past and whether it's 2500 or 6000 I think they'll keep an eye on populations and merge realms accordingly.
---
Oh. Okay. 
---
The AQ book version of heroic strike is 332 additional threat. I can definitely see that version being better when dual wielding due to the fact that yellow attacks don't suffer the dual wield hit penalty + avoiding glancing blow damage reduction. 
---
For traditional shield tanking I really doubt that the non-AQ version of heroic strike is more rage efficient than sunder armor under any circumstances, but the AQ version looks like it might have roughly the same rage efficiency for a warrior without any weapon skill that is losing a lot of damage from glancing blows.
---
What is the whole point of your post? Price cuts are offered in particular countries with lower income. You not being able to afford your own PC at 12 years old is a moot point. You’re saying NA and EU players will be able to afford their own subs cause they are older now. Indeed that is how time works, people age. PC requirements for this game will be very low compared to most every other game. Stop using GDP as a marker for adult disposable income.
---
Full T2 Paladin with Lok'amir, Red Dragonscale Protector, Shard of the Falling Star and ZHC. Pewpew.
---
The population might shift a little but people are going to want to play what is strong. Both warrior and rogue are strong end game classes so I still expect to see around the same amount. I think top 3 played in no particular order will be warrior, rogue, mage. I think you will see a class like Druid tick up a little but I still expect them to be on the low side. 
---
Are we sure that the macros that worked in vanilla (or work on p servers) are going to work in classic? WoW macro conditions and language have changed over the years, and the 1.12 client we are going to be playing on is not the 2006 client, nor is it a p server based on 1.12, obviously. 
---
Not to shit on anybody's hard work compiling information, but I feel like there's likely a bunch of stuff in this thread that is incorrect. 
---
So how long about does it take for a level in classic vs retail
---
Can relate to knee pain
---
Past the 3rd tier in prot there isn't much dmg reduction it's mostly utility that isn't needed just nice to have on trash. You give up  5% parry in arms and 6 seconds of shield wall. That isn't going to make or break anything regardless of your gear.  
---
If a fresh 60 warrior is fury prot it's not going to make much diff then if they are impale prot or imp demo prot. The most important talents that have the largest impact are at the top of the prot tree. One point in imp shield block , last stand and defiance.
---
World buff timers.
---
That video literally says right click report should be in the game, did you watch it? 
---
We don't even know at what speed they are releasing buckets. 
---
I don’t think so. Even after years of private servers populations remained similar, to my knowledge.  I don’t think reddit polls are a good representation of the general playerbase, either, but I can’t wait to see!
---
Sure, it's more of a struggle but it can be very fun!
---
Nice compilation of guides. Saving as reference.
---
I'd recommend everyone that didn't play classic should just play the game and figure it out on your own at first. 
---
Come back for ways to improve after you got the chance to be a noob and enjoy the adventure/experience.
---
meh if you go that route then playing wow is useless too
---
might as well go full nihilist and end yourself cuz nothing actually matters
---
A random elite would spawn in the middle and drop BOE blues.
---
Many nouns which relate to Blizzard lore are removed because it wouldn't make sense to have two Onyxia's in the World of Warcraft world. I'm 99% sure there's a text file somewhere in the 1.12 folder or MPQ's which displays all the forbidden names
---
Ok, cool. I never knew that. Something to explore in classic wow!
---
I love this type of theory crafting. I hope this subreddit promotes more of it. It reminds me of the type of stuff you would find on an early elitst jerks forums. I hope to see this level of stuff for other classes/specs and PVP too!
---
sweet!!!!!!!! i already see old names! yay sticky!!!!!

My response is basically the same as what was mentioned in the comments:

Warriors don't get rage from heroic strike damage. It's the main reason why heroic strike is rage inefficient since a geared warrior will easily lose 8+ rage per swing that is a heroic strike.
---
Oh. I need new underwear.
---
I honestly don't understand people who want to play classic with any form of transmog... Go play retail, they've got all the pretty princess dress up action you could possibly want.
---
No
---
I was talking specifically about eastern europe (not russia), because eastern europe is often stuck with western retail prices with low income making paying a game a lot more difficult. 
---
If you earn 900$ and you have to pay 90$ for battlefield + premium, then its an equivalent of paying 250$ if you earn 2500$.
---
And this is the reality of countries like Hungary (as one mentioned in the post). So they are stuck with bad income, but high prices, because the prices *are not* adjusted.
---
What gear you're wearing has a huge impact on your rage gen. If you are wearing full wrath with as much avoidance as possible you will have alot less rage then if you wearing their dps threat sets getting crit and crushing blown occasionally on private servers.
---
You're right, nothing is certain at the moment.  I'll be doing my best to keep this list up-to-date after launch.
---
Cool! I used to know Zorrim and I think Tigs (if those are the people that I think they are) back on Medivh. Some people from the guild I was in left for Ascent. We were a casual guild so I understand why. However, I think late in vanilla, Madivh and some other servers were having some serious lag issues. Servers would die for a bit and cause raid wipes, I've even heard of some bosses resetting for some reason. I only ever experienced the server not responding for a bit and then we'd wipe. It frustrated the serious raiding guilds enough that some of them changed servers to new ones (thought to have better/newer hardware). Lost touch with a few folks after that.
---
Yeah, I am the hunter taking the picture here. Played in Drama and DnT.
---
Because 3 of the 4 races have their starting zone in EK and to get to Kalmidor you have to make a 20 minute walk through a lvl 20-30 zone..
---
is it? I thought windfury was a buff to your weapon, and druids didn't get bonus from weapon since they're not hitting with it.   Perhaps im wrong but I was under the impression that windfury didn't proc for druids. 
---
Googling this I get a pserver forum confirming that it doesn't. 
---
I’m not aware of anything saying that’s what the population was, I’m aware of plenty of people saying that’s the distribution on p-servers and what they will roll in classic. 
---
&gt;Patchwerk and Thaddius are DPS
---
People 1 shot these bosses on launch in aq40 gear with consumables. Requiring a certain amount of gear from the raid in which the dps check resides is par for the course most mmo's why not Naxx?  
---
&gt; Loatheb , Sapphiron and KT 
---
You sure this can't be mitigated with shadow/frost resist gear? I find that hard to believe.
---
Thanks for an actual response. The druid uptick makes the most sense to me because I think people have realized how good they were back then. 
---
Main tanked multiple guilds through Vanilla / BC. This will be a good watch. 
---
VC? You mean DM, right? :) 
---
That’s the one. I saw Skarm use it to AoE pull in UBRS. 
---
That's actually sort of what spawned this question. There was a poll recently with druid coming out really high, and rogue kind of low. Could just be the Reddit demographic though. 
---
....is nobody going to tell him? 
---
This IS a Hurricane trailer.
---
Pservers aren’t true 1.12 clients. There is a lot of guesswork that goes into them. 
---
Ahh, I should have checked the name haha. Nice, I've only really been into raiding in Cata, Legion and now BFA. Are you planning on playing classic? 
---
Dude...hamstring kiting is just simply a strategy used to maximize the damage done and damage taken ratio while leveling, that's it. Most of the time while leveling, warriors are going to be using slow 2-handers and most mob's attack speed is 2.0. So basically, you hamstring kite so that every time you hit, you take a hit.
---
That's simply it, it doesn't have anything to do with hit formulas or anything like that.
---
If your post was just about that, then it would have made sense. But you implemented your age and not affording a pc, listing the reason that NA and EU can afford subs because they’re older now, along with a misunderstanding of GDP. Organize your thoughts son. 
---
&gt;How do we define necessary even? Every single advantage will reduce the chance of wiping.
---
It's mostly just the simplest single thing that's absurdly op. 
---
Troll post
---
Uhm. I know this. Did you even read what I wrote above. I'll quote myself.  
---
" You have tons of rage anyways from being hit you don't need rage gen from white hits. "  
---
With a 1.4 speed weapon on AQ40 bosses, I can't even use all my rage even if I heroic strike every single swing.   
---
Every Blizzard game has them just about. I don't see why there won't be at least one
---
Definitely a majority of warriors since the fury warrior meta has long been established on private servers. Sure it existed back in 2005 as well, but not to the extent it does today.
---
I expect many people to do a fair bit of research before jumping into Classic, so a good way to gauge the population somewhat is just to look into the theorycrafting. Is it strong af? Expect legions of that class/spec. 
---
Well i just want to play a class that's fun and doesn't get rekt too hard in PvP
---
I remember before the meta shift happened when i was in a bit more of a casual guild. We cleared the content and after a while raiding got a bit boring. Trying to speed clear content, reignited interest in raiding and gave us another path of progression while waiting for AQ to come out.
---
I think you will find people who are interested in your idea. Especially since it lets them raid log or use their gold to respec for PvP.  But i will say, the risk of being burnt out after clearing the content is a real thing, and the risk of being killed by bosses that other guilds kill with no effort will be demoralising. The problem is that you can't play WoW in a vacuum and other players even those that you do not play with do affect your game play. 
---
I think you would have a lot of success at the beginning, but you will have a chance of losing your good players when things get tough and they start to feel crap for being behind other guilds in terms of success. How you manage that is what will make of break the guild.
---
But then you lose windfury weapon totem unless the shaman is doing their mana burning totem dance. Paladins throw on their buff and then get to forget about it. 
---

this link might help you 
---
Could not agree more !
---
Sure, you can do hat as well. If you're a clothie, you'll probably want max tailoring on your main at one point so you can make all the bags you need in a month or so before you drop it for another profession. As a non-clothie, having tailoring on an alt for bags makes sense.
---
I find that very hard to believe. Well-practiced guilds 1-shot Naxx in aq40 gear on release. Nothing in Naxx is really comparable to how tightly tuned LK25hc was for example and I'm 100% assuming gear progression, i.e. requiring most of the raid to be mostly Naxx geared before it's possible. That and resist gear to make up for protection potion spam.
---
Yeah, the whole appeal of a blizzard server over private servers is that your character will always be there. 
---
It was basically: NA/EU will play classic, because they grew up and can easily afford playing the game nowadays opposed to 15years ago when most were children and teenagers relying on their parents. EU/NA will migrate to classic.
---
Low income countries will have a higher % staying on private servers, because - you guessed it - they can't afford it as often as EU/NA.
---
Not quite the hardest concept to grasp when chewed for you, is it now? ;)
---
Tranquil Air is an air totem so cannot be up together with Windfury that's the go to choice ofc in melee group. If u want casters benefit from it u must have a raid with 7/8 Shamans (because if u have only 5/6 Shamans they will be put in the melee groups ofc) and it would be only group wide. Salvation is a 30% flat threat reduction RAIDwise and u only need 1 Paladin for it. It's not even comparable. Pallys are OP.
---
Correct me if I’m reading this wrong, but you’re trying to make a 40 man raid group of either all druids and shamans or all druids and paladins? If that’s the case, I’d say just pick the faction you have more fun with. I don’t think you’d be able to progress very far inside MC with either of those so just play what will most inspire you to prove math wrong. 
---
If you’re planning on including other classes (mages, locks, warriors) I’d say go ally, as those classes tend to benefit more (as a collective whole) from pally buffs.
---
Blizzards approach to problemsolving is usually all or nothing.
---
It's just 5 damage/hit received thorn-like effect but early on it is really nice on warriors for AoE tanking. Can't say for druids or wannabe tank pallies but I presume it works the same. 
---
This is all because the shield effect stays even when swapping helms.
---
For actual clothies it can help spriests and face-tanking locks while grinding even if the damage is quite minimal. 
---
Great, if you want to sit down to drink every 2 pulls.
---
16th july, it's going to happen
---
Yeah for sure it's a fun project not serious raiding. Although I'm curious how far we might get.
---
paladin and druid by a mile. you need dispel. and paladin tank can actually hit def cap and tank some hard hitting bosses, that'd be really hard to tank for a druid tank. 
---
Druids aren't very good until they become top-tier gods in TBC.
---
It is.
---
ok, well good luck with your aq40 gear and no world buffs or consumables...let us know how that goes for you.
---
&gt;  blast through bosses  
---
not interested
---
&gt; help to gear your entire raid 
---
such that i can blast through even more? unfortunately, I care not about loot, but overcoming a challenge
---
&gt; spend that time wiping on the boss 
---
Ever done 200+ wipe boss progression? The feeling when you finally prevail is legit 100x better than coke.
---
It's a waste of time to farm on a druid unless you have t2+ quality gear you won't make more than 20-25g an hour. 
---
Druid Paladin
---
WF does not help druids and kings is the best buff a druid can have. 
---
As others have said, it doesn’t sound like you want classic. Or it sounds like you want them to transition into TBC after Naxx.
---
Skarm cleared half of Naxx in Vanilla. 
---
A simple "whoops accidentally typed rage when I meant threat" would have sufficed. Editing your post to hide the mistake and then acting indignant just makes you a tool.
---
When I played vanilla I had a nighstalker as my pet up until i stopped playing around lvl 50. His name was tiger. Think I'll go for it again.
---
Feral white hits do not proc windfury but they work with hand of justice
---
I think 4k is the magic number
---
I know they put it in the game deliberately, and the prot pot example is more "these things are legit op as fuck", not "obscure and annoying to farm" (which they still are tbh)
---
Those who don't learn from history etc
---
I'm unsure how to respond to your first statement because it sounds like you're agreeing that you need consumables.  Both of those bosses have hard enrage timers so even if you manage to survive that long, if you don't have enough overall dps to kill it they enrage and wipe the raid.  Consumables help with this, both so healers have more mana and regen, tanks have more health and mitigation, and higher dps so the entire encounter is shorter.
---
I'm 100% sure Loatheb cannot be countered with anything but shadow protection potions, his damage is an irresistible shadow damage dot that increases in frequency as the fight progresses and hits everyone in the raid.  Melee also takes nature damage from a poison cloud aura he has in a small radius around his feet.  The other mechanic on the Loatheb fight is healers will get hit with a debuff that put all their healing abilities on a shared cooldown for 2 minutes after casting one, meaning only the tank will ever be receiving heals (outside of extremely rare circumstances).
---
Sapphiron and KT can both be mitigated by frost resist gear but they're both hugely taxing on healer mana, and if DPS is wearing full mitigation gear their dps will go down dramatically, which extends the duration of the encounter which means the healers have to keep healing for longer.
---
Total or per race?
---
Yikes. Didn't edit anything to "cover up a mistake". Maybe you misread it.
---
Paladins. The blessings are much stronger than the totems are. Ferals do not hit with their weapons, so therefore cannot proc windfury or any other on hit effects on their weapons (fiery enchant for example). In a raiding scenario, a feral tank benefits alot by rest of the raid having salvation as well. 
---
Nice one! So poetic lol
---
In terms of the API functionality? There's no telling how the API is going to look yet ofc, but it's safe to assume it's going to run a modified 7.3.5 or 8.1.x API with non vanilla features removed such as castbars, focus, achivement ui, etc. They've already confirmed multiple times that they won't use the original classic client.
---
I had a dude on my friends list who was online nearly every day, but I swear in the entirety of time I played from Vanilla to late Wrath, he progressed only from about level 20 to about 65. 
---
Years and years and he never even hit level cap for a particular expansion. Though I do know he was AFK the majority of the time because he was a dad and had presumably had a job, but I just remember months passing and he would progress from like level 24 to 26 and it blew my mind. 
---
The wetlands run is what you make of it, and schlepping between westfall, Loch Modan, and redridge can be just as tedious.
---
I don't understand why people think this. What I'm saying is I want the leveling experience in classic to last longer than a few years. If servers are left on their own for 3 years or more, eventually the leveling zones will become empty. The only way to keep a constant leveling population is if the population is steadily climbing, which it won't.  Therefore, if all we do is release classic servers once and let them get old, eventually that experience of leveling with many people will die. No question.
---
So how do we preserve the classic wow leveling experience? You release new classic servers after a few years.
---
Let people use addons. It doesn’t change the core gameplay for anyone not using it, and only the upper level (or hardcore) guilds will potentially require you to use them. If you’re that sort of player then you’ll probably want them anyways. 
---
Hardware limitations or not, it's clear to everyone including blizzard the impact that it had on the overall feel of the game that led to its success. 
---
Ret paladins are absolutely top tier in pvp, if very gear dependent.
---
A well geared ret pally will outlast almost anyone and deal massive burst damage
---
Have they said free play below level 20 will be in classic? It wasn't in vanilla. 
---
Yeah, I think your first big hurdle in mc would be the AoE imp pulls. I’m guessing paladins would have an easier time of it than shamans would as the mobs will likely have strong resistances to fire nova and chain lightning. 
---
Naturally on some fights shamans are a bigger boost - things like tremor totem or AoE healing are clutch. 
---
At the end of the day I think just based on the fact that nature tends to be resisted at a much higher rate than holy, the choice is kind of simple.
---
I always liked their silly "HAWURR" battle cry. At least they get Dash!
---
My brother sold his Shaman, 6 months later wotlk hit and it still wasn't sold on the website. Grabbed his box code and said he was hacked. Got it back. xddddd

Why is the far east Hinterlands fp beneficial? Just curious
---
How to not get the chills when the dwarf pops on the screen?
---
Geez man, I need a release date...
---
Lupos will likely not be shadow damage but attack speed should vary from beast to beast since they didn't normalize it until patch 2.0.
---
No wonder everyone was a clicker to start with....
---
^^/s
---
That'll be shortly after I begin my new job, which actually pays livable wage. Perfect timing!
---
Just out of curiosity, was Ascent originally an EverQuest guild?
---
Because you chose to say the game gets stale, where I think other people have a different opinion. Personally I wouldn’t mind fresh servers after Naxx has been out for a while. 
---
tab targeting called and said hello
---
WEATHER! 
---
My very first character was a dwarf priest, who I played very little as I was in college and didn't have time for it. He probably still exists, so I'll have ot check, but I want to say he only got to level 15\~ or so. I then came back with a NE priest, also in college, and got him to level 50 or so. But then college ended in 2006 and I leveled a Paladin and a Mage to 60 that summer before TBC. I've largely mained a mage ever since (a brief break to play Ele Shaman for Cata).
---
That's sort of what I expect as well. I guess that means there will be a lot more SPriests and Warlocks than there were before? 
---
That’s a good point.
---
You are welcome.
---
1. I'll kind of give you that, but MC/BWL I expected to be easy as I even did them in Vanilla, but AQ just started being available and it's a bit of an anti-climactic faceroll - so the point still stands
---
2. 4 days raiding is par for the course in even semi-hc progression raiding in every mmo since everquest. Most guilds on pservers are raiding 1-2 days at most. So push that back to 3 and tbh, it's not a huge ask.
---
&gt; it does not take 3 hours/week to farm consumables. 
---
For farm raids when you dont have to be extreme, e.g. flasked/badlands shit die \~0 times, sure, otherwise I'd like some pointers and/or whatever you're smoking
---
Well mine would be hard to get but here's hoping, been rocking the name "Luck" on my mage since BC on Haomarush -&gt; Emerald Dream, was originally Satu in vanilla 
---
true, but at least they're are actually in raids. not farming 3 hours for ever 1 spend in a raid.
---
What class is considered best farming character? Is it Hunter?
---
This would be such a blessing. It truly would be outstanding if classic was released the last week of August. All the kids in school &amp; all the colleges starting. Hopefully classic is released on a Thursday. Would love to take off an entire 2 days + a week and play classic for 11 days straight. 
---
I mean leveling gets stale. Given enough time, the vast majority of a server population will be 60. Therefore if you want to relive the experience of vanilla wow leveling a few years after it's launched, it will be a solo experience. 
---
What people don't realize is that what I'm saying is necessary and will happen. If fresh servers aren't released, eventually you won't have a true classic mmo leveling experience outside private servers, there will be an outcry to rerelease classic on new servers, and I'm sure Blizzard will see this as the most logical decision.
---
2 account master race.
---
2nd account with 1 bank alt and 9 level 1s that have corpse run themselves to rare recipe vendors. Cycle through on 2nd monitor / computer every few minutes. So much gold.
---
Mage T2 is godlike. Why you would mislead someone about that is beyond me.
---
4k concurrent players on a server. They keep the sharding up for 2-4 weeks depending on pop levels, then cap servers @4k after. 
---
I was JUST thinking about this today.
---
There is a lot to enjoy that doesn't require a group but you will be missing out on end game PvE, leveling dungeons, and most likely high ranked pvp since you need premades.
---
Leveling is a big aspect of the game and a lot of people enjoy the leveling process. The majority of the leveling process can be done solo. You can also farm dungeons, farm mats/gold in open world, worldPvP (you won't kill the enemy faction leader but you can still kill randos), randomBGs(no premades), collect rare items/mounts/pets/ect, finish unique quest chains. There is plenty to do and enjoy but you will still miss a big part of the game if you don't interact with people. Who knows, you might find a group of people you enjoy hanging with so I would at least keep an open mind.

---
Sweet! What town you live in?
---
That's news to me then.
---
OMG
---
Well we know for an absolute fact it was too high on nostalrius, whether or not the "nerfed" version is blizzlike is anybody's guess since we don't have the real numbers.
---
Basically unprovable as of right now either way.
---
I think you're underestimating owl damage compared to cats, it's just a 3% difference between the families. Vanilla's two stable slots honestly made it easier to focus on one pet you could max out the loyalty level for and save you the time it would have taken to level them all to 60 beyond that one.
---
A bit of a weird question, and it won't affect anything for me (I plan on playing Horde as I played Alliance in vanilla in the past) - which faction do you think will attract the overall higher quality players this time around?
---
I can dig that ditch! Im feeling closer to 3-3.5k but happy with anything less than 5k.
---
To the point that he had to ignore the prodding for more information on the niche dual wield fury/prot build multiple times. He was even hesitant to give the exact talents for each of the builds. It was as if he wanted players to get the general idea of each and learn the class themselves rather than throw out a cookie cutter spec, like Tips kept asking for.
---
The video probably could have been half as long if it were just Skarm going through his information without interruptions.
---
Right click report isn't inherently bad, it's just flawed and needs to have checks added so that it can't be abused. The report function in vanilla was so convoluted, people were begging for right click report for years.
---
24 yes...28 is zg
---
&gt;Again, it may not apply to you.  But I think it applies to most of these.
---
Unfortunately, AQ launches on Sun (K3) and I have 3k+ gold worth of consumables just waiting for us to lol the raid in probably 1-3 raid nights (we already cleared on ptr in 2(?) nights). I suppose I just had a fair amount of reverence for AQ since it rekt my guild in vanilla, so it's all a bit hmmm. I wasn't expecting a wipe fest, but at least some semblance of progression?
---
If its unprovable how do we know nost was too high? Not informed on this. Legitimate question not trolling

Only problem is youre not going to be able to do strictly those zones without grinding aswell.

4k is cap, you have to wait in queue after 4k. So casually server should be at 3-3.5k hopefully

If he's not willing to tank in post-MC raids, I don't see why he would farm the Smoking Heart. It's BiS, but it's really not necessary for 5 mans. You don't need anything for these as a tanking Druid really. Mark of Tyranny is largely enough.
---
&gt; They've already confirmed multiple times that they won't use the original classic client.  
---
That's nice. I'm not asking for the original client lol.  
---
I have no idea why you are getting downvoted for posting a very rational and clear explanation about something helpful.
---
You're literally saving people time by encouraging them to level the alts to 10-15+ before setting them down to exploit rest-xp.
---
Why would anyone downvote this?
---
If anything I expect it to be worse this time around as most people are going to be familiar ahead of time with how classes actually work so there's a lot less potential for the bait switch situation a lot of hybrids ended up in.
---
Personally I like cross realm bgs. I know thats unpopular though.
---
On nostalrius tanks were perma capped at 100 rage, thus the tank meta was using alcor's sunrazor and HS every gcd.
---
Upon video inspection we at least know that tanks were NOT in fact perma rage capped like they were on nostalrius, but we don't have the true formula on how rage is calculated yet.
---
My point is really that, even having done a metric feck ton of farming and have all that shit sitting there, I'd still vote for the guild charging in and taking it in the face
---
I bet this sub has one of the oldest average subscriber ages. 
---
Battlegroups are going to happen. You have to be delusional to think they will keep the old system. Wait times demotivate incentive to PvP/BG
---
SPriests for sure, but expect a very lopsided distribution of locks between factions. Ally locks are notoriously weaker (mostly in solo play/small groups) vs horde cause of undeads.
---
indeed, make it earlier!
---
yeah lets start hogging character names before the game is released
---
Ah yea I heard about that.

Joana broke down the times for classic by level.

---
&gt;- Guild rule 101: it is mandatory that noone uses buff consumables, except maybe bandages &amp; health/mana pots
---
Don't forget flasks. 
---
Hopefully to clear things up in regard to heroic strike/sunder armor:
---
Since heroic strike doesn't trigger the GCD (global cooldown), and instead takes the place of your next autoswing, the only hinderance it has on your other abilities is the rage that you spend using it. On Vael for example (where you have unlimited rage), you want to use heroic strike 100% of the time in addition to spamming other abilities every 1.5 seconds (GCD is 1.5 sec for warriors). When rage starved however, heroic strike isn't the best option. Like I mentioned in the video, heroic strike costs 15 rage as well as not generating rage from the white swing that it takes the place of. You're better off autoattacking instead for more rage instead while using your other abilities. Typically I like having 40+ rage as deep prot before I start spamming heroic strike; at that point you should still have enough rage to use your other abilities on GCD as well. One more thing worth mentioning is that if you have 5+ weapon skill, white hits do more damage (less glancing blow reduction) which makes heroic strike not quite as necessary for avoiding glancing blows.
---
As for sunder (assuming there's already 5 stacks up), only use it when Shield Slam/Bloodthirst &amp; Revenge are on cooldown, since those moves generate more threat than sunder armor.
---
As deep prot (not fury prot) you're going to have more rage issues since you're not doing as much damage or taking as much damage compared to DW fury prot. It's not uncommon to switch your gear depending on the fight. The less damage a boss does, the more threat gear you can wear. In this regard, it's also not always necessary to spend rage on Shield Block every 5 seconds if you're not taking a lot of damage to begin with.
---
I could keep talking about this, but I'll leave it here for now. Hope that helps clear things up.
---
The concept isn’t difficult to understand, while your thought organization and post coherency is. Good day, smart ass. 
---
It's always been Alliance. Although statistic would say it's almost a 50-50 split, most people tend to pick Alliance first, primarily because they have a Human (something a real person can relate to the most and immerse himself in), as well as the fantasy behind the Alliance looks slightly more appealing.
---
Oddly enough, I never properly played Alliance in Vanilla up to Cata. I was and still am Horde first. So this time I might make an Alliance alt on another realm and try to hit 60 to experience their own leveling journey.
---
&gt; Also in the calculations I will identify threat per second, not just threat per rage.
---
I think this is the crux. In the end what matters is TPS and you not dieing, rage efficiency is only a tool to achieve those things. Lets us know if you find anything interesting.
---
I'll only be using my alt hunter for pvp so I'll be leveling a scorpid for the poison stacking to protect my stings. It's a specific scorpid I have to get at low level so I'll be leveling with it.
---
I'm leveling as survival primary anyway so the pet won't matter much.
---
Nax my fav old time raid. Cant wait to do it again
---
What are you talking about? You absolutely should go bear tank on horde! Horde desperately need a strong threat tank because of the lack of Blessing of Salvation. Also horde druids have one less dispeller to deal with for their HoTs.  
---
Threat is super important in raiding, every guild should have one good druid tank they support.
---
What does that have to do with Hunter Pets?
---
What I will point out is that coolness is always a side effect of something real or perceived real.
---
Not having transmogg removes one way that players use to try to trick others into believing that they are cooler than they actually are.
---
Coolness doesn’t come from how you look, but from what how you look means to other people.
---
Oh shit I forgot about Strat 45 mans.  Was so amazing when our group finally did it, I think it took us like 4 tries?  
---
Those rare stats are gone in 1.12 though. Raptor ends up being nothing more than a cat that can't prowl. Not a good choice anymore.
---
Right and it needs to be done because the current "damage done and damage taken" ratios on private servers is not based on the same math as Classic blizzard severs
---
That is because we know private servers were based on guess work and incorrect math. Therefore the ratio is incorrect.
---
Therefore just because it is meta on private servers doesn't mean it will be meta on retail classic. 
---
Yeah, I’m gonna agree with you. Skarm specifically said “nearly 100% uptime on Heroic Strike” as a way to increase threat. 
---
I have a few theories. 
---
1. People don’t like opposing views, and reddit historically has an echo chamber mentality, no matter how sound my advice was.
---
2. The fact that I posed it as a math problem could have been misconstrued as arrogant maybe? That would be a calculus level problem after all, and math is often viewed as the most hated subject, calculus specifically has a very high drop out rate. 
---
3. there’s the pack mentality, once the downvote threshold reaches 5+ people tend to pile on. 
---
The first two are the most important.
---
Here's the Expansion announcement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cud5DMrF6GE

---
40 people without DC's, need tiolet, oops the door bell rang, oh my mobile is going off one sec. Get my drift is allways half the battle.
---
A gnome 
---
That is not their best buff necessarily, and one missing synergy isnt a deal breaker.
---
The problem I think the WoW devs have always faced is that its really hard to gauge how many people actually want something. Sure there's been some backlash, but not from enough people to actually populate a server.
---
I don't think I've ever told the group to run away from a rare mob or have been told to run away from a rare mob.  
---
The main reason for pushback on this topic is that it's a little too early to be discussing it. There's somewhere in the realm of 3-4 months until Classic *begins.* Make this post again in 2-2½ years.
---
Nah bro leveling is all about movement speed. Greatest synergy is Sham/Druid. Feral swiftness and the cheetah, + frost wolf at 20. Izipizi. 
---
Welcome to the club. Its only going to get worse as when summer gets closer LOL
---
Gets into the minuses where I am

look at this screenshot he posted, dragon slayer, zg buff, dmf buff, dm buff, but somehow no flask https://i.imgur.com/MxLyo3C.jpg
---
I just love talking about classic wow, and this kind of thing has been on my mind for a while. I had some friends saying they should add raid tiers to keep people playing classic, but I think the more authentic experience would be to keep the servers where they are and have fresh servers released a year ish after naxx.
---
I check out both the EU "from the EU myself" and the US blizzard forums and i also come here". 
---
And of course you wouldn't mind sharing the rare recipe vendors? 😎
---
Great name my dude
---
I was a rogue trying to be a hunter.  Lasted 7 levels until I realized I dont get any bow skills. I'd give almost anything to be that noob again.
---
/u/Sawyermblack, Can you just make your case then. Your responses to our are sort of bouncing back and forth.
---
And from a development standpoint  /u/wardz is right. It is pretty safe to assume seeing that what we have seen already is just that.
---
Again, what are you thinking or hope will happen? I am very curious since you seem to think we have it all wrong or something :)
---
It doesn't need to be done, it just makes warrior leveling more efficient, it's just simply a leveling strategy that is probably going to be used in classic as well because, as I said already, it just makes leveling more efficient.
---
Your statement about rage gen being affected btw is also inaccurate, you create far more rage from dealing damage then from taking it.
---
Van cleef I assume
---
Also worth noting that this strategy varies from class to class. Melee classes are more suited for mobs equal to or lower than their character level because of weapon skill.
---
Dunno, you can access that side of the zone easier, and it's quicker to fly and run from Tarren Mill for the most part if you're starting from, say, UC then it would be to fly past where you want to be, down to Revantusk, and back up the hill. 
---
Not? Look at the official forums. The RP thread (majority is asking for RP PvP realm) and rp PvP thread is more popular than the AV and content plan threads. 
---
It's quite clear blizzard would be quite stupid to not have an RP PvP realm at release.
---
Yeah that is a ton of grinding- you'll run out of quests right quick.  Even in just the barrens, you'll have trouble finding yellow quests at times without either doing a grinding session for a level or so.  Personally I love massacring the quilboars for those 'agamaggan' buffs you can get at Camp T.  
---
I see pixels. That means this video is legit.
---
Has to be released by 2019, was said to be "early 2019" at blizzcon. But looking like classic will launch first. Really was hoping to play reforged pre classic to pass time
---
&gt; there was an exploit 
---
It was an exploit and depended on abusing server latency. Servers aren't going to be as bad as they were back then. No reason to have those exploits back in the game.
---
There’ll be a lot more healers running around. Not sure why. 
---
Why would they remove ML from dungeons?
---
not sure, stopped playing at TBC
---
It's not too bad.. Don't run on the road between Crossroads and Ratchet and your'e good.  The mobs are only about level 15 near that road so you can safely move off of it a ways, avoid fights and keep movin. 
---
The north side of XR is much safer than the south side!  A lot more traffic to the south with wailing caverns and overall more content on the southern side means a lot more players running back and forth. 
---
Once you get by XR, the only 'hot spot' is that centaur camp and then you've got very lightly trafficed areas.  it's fun =P
---
Once Dire Maul is released, sure.
---
skinning
---
huehue
---
Nax is my old time fav raid. But like vanilla all the raids are good some more than others.Its not the rewards which is allways good but doing the content with 39 other people which made the raids good.  
---
No.
---
They've said in the past it's not against the tos. If they haven't done anything about it in 15 years, they won't now.
---
I mean,  we still tend to farm some amount of consumables.  Its not nearly as much as it was in vanilla,  but thats because vanilla let you have like 6 different consumables at a time
---
You don't want them to make new servers a few years after classic?
---
Something that got fixed by 1.12
---
With the exception of a few leads, I don't think a lot of devs will jump at the chance to work on the same game they worked on before.  It's also likely the dev team is going to be mostly tech people, programmers, tech artists, etc since a lot of what they're doing is conversion.  They may have like, one or two designers and a couple artists to fix bugs/touch up stuff.
---
hes thinking of ice barbed spear probably which is unlikely to be in at launch, neither will dire maul so gearing as a hunter will be actually super rough
---
Bat or Owl for pve and a cat with prowl for pvp
---
Boars were excellent for leveling in Vanilla
---
Yup it is. Half their classic panel and watercooler posts have been explaining why they'll use the modern existing client (aka 7.3.5 or 8.1.x) to process the 1.12.1 data.
---
What are you specifically asking for a source to? 
---
&gt; a pet for a collector's edition, blizz will print money.
---
Maybe, but that type of "printing money" definitely contributed to the downfall of retail and would definitely be a very negative sign of things to come.
---
Try getting to Badlands as Horde for the first time. 
---
What they said is that if you were to only level rested xp, it would save time. You are saying it's a waste of time to take advantage of that at low levels since, the bonus XP will get used up faster, and it caps at a few levels higher than your current level.
---
While not incorrect that the effect is marginal, it isn't a waste of time. Less kills to level is less kills. Whether it's 100 less kills, or two less kills, less kills is less time. Creating a character, logging them out, then only playing them when you didn't want to play your main only speeds things up. 
---
The only argument you could make would be the time it takes to log in 5 times between 1-15, as opposed to busting it out in a single 4 hour session, but provided you used your load times wisely, and didn't just stare at the loading screen, that isn't wasted time either.
---
For sure. I'm looking forward to Kargoz doing some revisions after launch though; loss of his content is based on private servers, I hear.
---
I may create a second account just to try fishbotting. Usually hard to detect if you are no where near players. Easy way to get decent gold with literally no effort.   
---
Obviously I don't condone it for others, hence why I'm going a second account for that.   
---
I did it all through TBC and WotLK and never worried about gold, super nice. I do expect downvoted with this post
---
I get where you're coming from, and it's certainly an interesting topic. I wouldn't get your hopes up though - Blizzard isn't exactly the type of company that takes a lot of gambles with their product quality. Would they take the leap of adding custom content to Classic? I highly doubt it. Although it would be cool in a sense, I guess. I'm still leaning more towards the completely default version of Classic, untouched and unedited. Let's see what happens.
---
He may not, but he's clueless.
---
Fresh servers will begin if demand calls for it. They started in retail and they continued through private servers.
---
&gt; Crit being increased when sitting is a bug.
---
Except it isn't. What is a bug is those crits proccing talents like Redoubt, Reckoning or Enrage.
---
You don't understand : the client is the program that is installed on your PC, it is the original Blizzard program from 2006. However what is on the server side is a completely different program than what Blizzard used, pserver recreated the server not the client.
---
Blizzard has the original code of the server, so if they wanted they could launch a real Vanilla server any day. They want to use a modern client / server because the original was not secure and was probably not architected correctly.
---
/u/awesometographer is basically the guy in the Leeroy video running the numbers
---
Exactly 
---
This is the reason Druid are strong tanks. 
---
They can achieve highest armour and hp.  Meaning that they can easily be healed if healers adjusts for it.  
---
When I ranked on my Druid I was constantly on 100% rage.  
---
Thanks for your archive work, mate. It's an arduous job.
---
Personally I kind of look forward to seeing gold sellers spamming chat 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
#nochanges 
---
Mine ended at 16 on my troll Shaman sometime in early 2005 when I stumbled into Wailing Caverns and died instantly to an elite raptor. I realized then and there I had no idea what I was doing and was better off rolling Alliance with my brother who was over 40 at the time
---
Titanpanel, atlasloot, gatherer, Auctioner, unitframes or xperl maybe, bagnon were big ones for me. DBM, pallypower, decursive, all handy addons.
---
&gt;Is the raiding meta noticeably different?
---
Yes and no. Raiding is different as both sides because DPS can go harder on Alliance thanks to Salvation, whilst Fury Warriors are outputting even more threat on Horde thanks to Windfury. Meaning that Horde tanks have to try harder to keep threat up. With Windfury being the main advantage to Horde it also means that Horde Druids have a slightly harder time tanking since they don't benefit from Windfury. However, you can raid perfectly well as either Horde or Alliance. It's just that Alliance overall have a slightly easier time. 
---
Isn't dual wield hit penalty just for your off hand weapon?
---
Oh and I don't trust Blizzard to make custom classic content. It should stop at naxx and that's it. The problem then is that eventually leveling zones dry up, and that whole experience gets lost to time again. My solution, release new servers.
---
ye got an arrow in the knee?
---
Its the same reason why maelstrom works or heart of w/e (drops off last boss in LBRS), its chance on hit with melee. Its a trinket effect. While, windfury totem imbues the weapon. It is the same reason why you don't enchant crusader on a druid weapon.
---
I couldn't agree more.  Anyone new to the game should just pick a race/class that resonates with them and dive in.  The overall experience will be so much more exciting that way.
---
What I'm saying is that I think fresh servers are inevitable. If not, eventually leveling zones dry up, and that mmo leveling experience gets lost to time again. The only way to keep that experience is to constantly release new servers every few years.
---
It's always going to happen no matter what steps Blizzard takes. The only thing you can do is avoid players who you knowi buy gold.
---
Edited. 
---
The problem is that getting levels is so quick at that level.  So you're level 6, you have a full level and a half of rested XP but it only takes you 45 minutes of grinding to get to level 7.5.  All that rested XP (like.. 5 days worth?) earned you 22.5 less minutes of grinding time. 
---
You're better off taking a few hours to get to a somewhat higher level (I've seen 10-15 at least mentioned in this thread) to give yourself more of a bonus and make it more time-effective. 
---
Keep in mind that Blizzard will be running Classic on their modern infrastructure. Stuff like botting etc. was rampant on the archaic systems back in 2005, but I'm confident it will be to a much lesser extent today.
---
If anything, they're fully aware of the problem that needs to be solved in this day and age and will hopefully implement the necessary security systems to curb gold sellers out of a profit.
---
It's hard to imagine a corporation like Blizzard *not* adding microtransactions
---
Don't forget the wave of cries from those few hundred holdouts about how classic ruined pservers.
---
*Not using AC all the time here in FL*
---
You madman!
---
I'm glad to see it works how I expected.
---
I doubt you or any one person can reach the solution on their own since we haven't been in this position before. Blizzard usually transitions WoW from one expansion to another, carrying over all characters, gold etc. A "fresh" Classic would either mean deleting old characters (imagine the outrage) *or* double the servers (massive cost/CS staff increase) and practically dilute the player population of most if not all realms.
---
This won't be a simple problem to solve.
---
As long as they use the original sound and not that cartoony bonk sound in new wow.
---
Ah, I've never understood how people can like those. Being able to sort stuff based on my bag is super important for me. 
---
It would be really cool if Dark Legacy could have a reunion with Classic. I don’t have a clue of just how much contact Keydar has with his old guildies though, if any at all. It’s entirely possible that he’s on his own, but I hope that’s not the case.
---
Hopefully I’m missing some information and Keydar has all his old friends on his contact list.
---
Don’t rush it. You will regret rushing to 60.
---
I have applied for 2 weeks leave starting on July 16th. Come on Blizz dont let me down!
---
&gt;But if they did add the wow token, which would cause rampant inflation imo
---
Howso?  The tokens dont make gold out of nowhere on live, other players have to buy them.  I think there might even be a slight cut (could be wrong on that).
---
Skarm was a huge scumbag in the private server seen.
---
Discord
---
We won't even have to worry about any of this until Phase 3 anyway.
---
I remember the last day of barrens chat... everyone said goodbye. Broke my heart.
---
They definitely can't delete old servers. I think it would be worth their time to have a new server release event though. Whenever a private server had been around for 3ish years, they would release a fresh server. Yes, the old server's pop would suffer, but they would experience an EXPLOSION of population because people love fresh vanilla. I'm sure the same would be true for classic, but on a larger scale. Eventually the old server and fresh servers are merged together once they've caught up in terms of progression. At that point you end up with the same amount of servers as before, and you can repeat the cycle.
---
Right and it makes he warrior more efficient because the ratio is incorrect. It's that simple. 
---
And you admitted that I was correct in your own statement. I never said you gain more rage from taking damage, just thsg you *do* generate rage from raking damage. Which you admitted. 
---
And since you are hitting the enemy less thanks to incorrect hit % on private servers, as well as getting hit less if you use the hamstring strategy, you are generating less rage overall. 
---
The point I'm making is that warriors have it even worse because private servers are not correct. That's why hamstring is better. But with blizzards more accurate math -- as well as any fixes or implementations that we're not aware of -- the meta might not be hamstring kiting. 
---
Anecdotally, I played vanilla through wotlk, then panda through Bfa. No one ever leveled a warrior with hamstring kiting back then.  
---
Getting ahead in terms of gold while leveling can be tough with skills costing several gold each towards 60.
---
Smoking Heart is much easier to get than the Warden Staff, although if he can wait until Phase 2 he can just get the Dire Maul mace.
---
Good distinction to be aware of, thanks 
---
but he died to DoT, had to spirit heal and while he was waiting for rez sickness, the rest already made it to Rohan.
---
Fortunately, Gandalf had that flight path marked.
---
Also the spiritual successor to CoH is coming out this summer, [City of Titans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=29&amp;v=D3NkmIhaqVY)
---
I am as hyped for CoT as I am Classic. 
---
Maybe someone actually knows, but the modern client doesn’t allow stacking of abilities in one macro.
---
It didn’t work like that in vanilla and I’m wondering if blizzard will allow it classic.
---
This should be classic wow reddit FAQ
---
i could make my peace with it, im already detached from any sort of competitiveness with the game etc. like if my first wow account was to dissapear now id be a bit bummed out but a fake one doesnt reall matter to me, vannila is so good that it would be impossible to not want to continue playing it with new people since its such a team oriented game /inner gay " what im saying is the time i spend playing with people in this game is more important to me then any character or account i made "
---
No, DW hit penalty applies to both weapons however your OH will do 50% less damage baseline (increased by talents).
---
Yes but it won't be a walk in the park, some quests really require grouping up
---
But I wouldn't mind having more characters!
---
Because boohoo people will abuse it and waaah I can't come up with social solutions to a social problem.
---
Dammit I miss CoH.... what an awesome fun game!
---
I wish this would extent to tbc in some way as well. I'm sure a lot of my tbc pals played vanilla, but I didn't.
---
No way man. Everyone has different ideas of what's fun for them. And even though they aren't represented well on this subreddit, I know a lot of people with the same mind set as me. Just like there will be a (no doubt) huge race to 60. You do you, I'll do me. Let's both have fun and call it good.
---
Whatyearisit.gif
---
I mean, you will never have 0 latency, so it will make it harder to exploit, but not impossible, unless they manage to fix the exploit some other way (by, for example, tweaking the mechanic so the “crit” from sitting will not register as a crit, but rather just a double-damage attack”
---
Not sure if your pet get unhappy if you go offline. Im sure they will not leave you if you arw offline for 6 months.
---
I think being online and pet taking damage is making him unhappy.
---
Cool guide! Do you know of any warrior specific grinding guides? I know it can be a pain in the ass following a guide like this for warriors are they like to kill things will low armour, no dodgy debuffs and mobs that are a couple of levels lower.
---
Thanks.
---
I used addons in vanilla, I want to again
---
I largely agree with what you say, but I think that "the old server suffers" is a very mild term. Let's be honest about it: It dies. All Kronos servers died, Anathema died - and any other project which was big enough to launch more than once had their first server die. Official Classic won't be any different, because people will go where the action is, and it will always be on the newest released server.
---
In terms of merging, that seems rather pointless. I mean if the first Classic server is on the Naxx patch, everyone in full tier 3 with thousands of gold etc, how could you ever merge it with the new server before well into the Naxx patch? And then what would be the point?
---
As I said, this really is a hard problem and a group of people are going to be disappointed by the final decision no matter which way it goes.
---
Missing two of the best buffs in the game for feral (Kings and Wisdom) is pretty huge when you're trying to put every synergy together just to scrape into being viable.  
---
At any rate the op was actually just asking about all guild/raiding with two classes so it's really just meme daydreaming that will never happen anyway.
---
Normally when a new expansion comes out i take off, but think this time i will get to 60 first, then take time off to farm and do dungeons.
---
I think the 10% intellect might be good, more consecrates
---
what the hell is a farm twink
---
Nope dont think I will. I hate leveling lol. I'll level an alt slowly or something 
---
/thread 
---
I think most of the experienced WoW players know that the retail high end difficulty raids are more mechanically challening. I doubt anyone is disputing that. Keep in mind that some of the players who raid vanilla hardcore also have done it in retail or are still doing it.
---
The reason why people flock to vanilla/classic isn't the mechanical raid difficulty, but alot of other things.
---
Also speedruns and doing things in the most efficient way possible is something that people do in all kinds of games, because the ceiling of doing that is almost unachieavable or so high that still poses a fun challenge, regardless of the entry level of the game. For example you can do a speedrun on a mechanically hard game like Super Meat Boy and [insert game to make fun of here] and it would pose almost the exact challenge because you are trying to achieve perfection, even though the diffculty of finishing the game in the first place is easier.
---
So with that said, if your argument had merit, we should all wonder why people play WoW at all if they look for a challenge, because wether you play vanilla or retail it is also "like children competing in sandbox" compared to many, many games outthere, especially the competitive online games.
---
I can't say I personally have ever been top tier in vanilla PvP, but the consensus around here from what I have gathered is that they do not deal "massive burst damage", they can't cope well with being kited and in organised play you just ignore them until last.
---
An overgeared one probably does okay in one-on-one world PvP against people dumb enough to run up to it and slug it out.
---
It's the best way to level alts. Vanilla is a grind in itself, and the first 10-15 even 20 levels are the worst for some classes. Ill be doing the same to "prep" the classes I want to play
---
In classic wow there is no such thing.
---
But in retail with how scaling works. You can be level 110, lock your exp and get the best gear possible. This level 110 char can solo dungeons in a few minutes for a ton of cloth and gold. Its used to farm gold or earn gold by selling boosts tru Island Expeditions.
---
Definitely not. 
---
If they're not on the GCD then you could have them all on the macro. For example trinket 1, trinket 2, arcane power, pom, pyro could be one button because pyro is the only spell their that triggers GCD.    
---
    
---
For hunter pet attack isn't on the GCD, but I think (but don't actually know) Aspects were on the GCD so hawk/mark in the one click wouldn't be possible.    
---
At any rate this is all pretty pointless until we see the actual api and macro implementation in the beta because you can guarantee it will be different to both vanilla and legion.
---
There's a problem right with with tokens giving guarenteed gold which means gold is generated. I don't like that.
---
I'm not so much against the idea of gold for gametime and money for gold as a solution to gold sellers, but i'd pref not.
---
Druid wasn't high, it was actually low. The poll was a Race + Class poll. Since the druids are only on one race in each faction they dominate that kind of poll.
---
Aka:
---
50 NE Druid
---
vs
---
25 Human Warrior
---
25 Dwarf Warrior
---
25 Gnome Warrior
---
25 NE Warrior
---
Makes druid look like their really high.
---
When you see that  noob mage you ran Deadmines with 2 weeks ago and he is 10 levels ahead of you and decked out in Blues. 
---
Basically when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimley see Gandalf in the next movie
---
That would be me. I want a clear message to blizzard that the reason their sub count is increasing is because of Classic. No gray lines 
---
Pro tip: ignore any mage guide that says to skip training Slow Fall. Hands down best spell for getting the full experience of Classic. /serious 
---
It wasn't 15-18 Mil lol 
---
Just to add to that: Pserver players are from my experience completely normal, meaning there's just as many good and bad players as on a blizzard server. The only real differences: there are better informed players and guilds. People simply generally more stuff and do less mistakes in terms of gearing, speccing etc. But as we all know that is only one of many factors.
---
I'm going into this knowing there's a chance I'll be let down. It's Blizzard, after all. 
---
Just look at old school Runescape. Lot's of players who are hyped for Classic WoW love to use OSRS as a reference/example of how it is possible to recreate a successful MMO while failing to realize that OSRS has went in the direction which no classic player wants Classic to go down. In the beginning, OSRS was advertised as #NOCHANGES and most players had the "nochanges" mindset. Now look at OSRS. It's a completely different game. Unrecognizable.
---
1. The list of realms, along with realm types. To let old friends regroup.
---
2. Whether AQ collection items will be changed, or not (of course we won't know WHAT are the items, we'll only know that they've been changed)
---
3. The list of changes from the original Vanilla WOW (We know about sharding, loot trading, mailbox, right-click reporting, [battle](https://battle.net).net social, so what next?)
---
4. Post-naxx plans (some people will value the feeling that they'll come back after 5 years, and their character will still be there as they left it, not as a TBC leveling char)
---
Any data that shows Reddit is mostly 14-20 year olds? My sister is 19 and I’m pretty sure none of her friends have ever even heard of Reddit. I’d guess it’s primarily ages 23-30 tbh
---
Old add-ons won't work with classic client afaik.
---
Many players here only played up to Vanilla/TBC/WoTLK and have no idea what a WoW token is.  I didn't.  I found this TLDR online:
---
- The WoW Token is an in-game item.
---
-You can buy one from Blizzard for $20, AU$25, €20, £15, NT$500, or ₩22,000 and sell it in the AH.
---
-You can buy one in the AH and use it to add 30 days of game time -or- use it to add $15, AU$17, €12.99, or £9.99 to your Blizzard Balance.
---
-The gold price is the same for all realms in a region, and is shown in the charts on this site.
---
So it sounds like a way for blizzard to cut out the gold sellers and become gold sellers themselves.  Honestly not a terrible idea.  Part of me is conflicted because it wasn't actually part if Vanilla but at the same time I know plenty of hardcore raiders were buying gold anyway because they didn't have time to farm it with a 5 day a week raiding schedule.
---
So in a way it's just streamlining something that was already part of Vanilla anyway.  I mostly don't care, but I suspect there will be a vocal group that is staunchly against it.
---
It is overrated in pve. Magmadar fear, nefarian fear and gluth fear can be outranged by all ranged (including healers). Magmadar fear can be dispelled. If you can’t do onyxia without fearward your tanks sucks. The optional boss in aq40 that has the fear mechanism is piss easy.
---
These 5 out of 70ish raidbosses in all of vanilla are the only ones that have the fear mechanism as a significant mechanism. Fear ward is useless on all other bosses than those 5.
---
Unless your guild is doing speed clear competition, there is little point to use fear ward on anyone else than the mt. One dwarf priest is enough for that.
---
Never seen a video in 14p before lmao
---
Not in modern wow where everything is faceroll scaled to your level and solo-able, but in vanilla you're definitely dead to a lot of rares if you agro them unexpectedly. Try fighting morladim, bangalash, stitches or a devilsaur when they're red to you.
---
If you put in the time and farm the mats to make the wicked set for instance its pretty good! Solid agility and stamina in quite a few slots. These items are i believe roughly 55-58 making them solid items for a pre dungeon set.  People are going to want to group up with players that have good gear.
---
Is there a better farm for druids pre DM?
---
I know this comment will be voted below the threshold. That being said that is why I kind of want them to nerf the dick off of instance farming. If all of the farmers have to do it in the real world. They can run into good ole street justice. If they can hid in instances. Well then the vaunted community can't do shit to patrol itself.
---
And of that range it’s probably closer to the high end. 
---
Elites =/= Rares (They are unique or unusual but not Rare)
---
Don’t sleep on grace of air and strength of earth totem.
---
I wish they didn't exist 
---
Can someone confirm I’m understanding this correctly? I plan on playing a hunter and want to make sure. 
---
So one of my favorite pets is the snow leopard in the draws starting zone. If I want to keep him as my main let all the way to 60, I will need to also train other cats as I level so I can learn higher cat abilities (like claw)? And if I do not train other animals, his ranks will stay at rank 1 forever and not level on their own. 
---
Am I understanding that right?
---
5k honorable kills and he’s rank 12, Damn it took me 9k kills just to get rank 10 on my last private server. 
---
My reaction first time was "guys I have a bad feeling about this". I was right.
---
1 hour?
---
Try 10+ straight hours for some.
---
Lots of rares in Vanilla are also elite and hit like a truck
---
Well literally none of the ones he mentioned are
---
King Mosh
---
Yes, that is correct. The way you learn other pet skills is you tame a pet with that skill. use it in battle a few times, then it will appear in your training tab. Then you summon your snow leopard, and use training points that the snow leopard has to learn that skill.
---
This website http://vanillawowhunter.com/vanilla-wow-pet-skills/  Is a good website to find out what pets have the skills you need.
---
I plan to begin streaming with Classic. I don't have a big personality nor plan to accentuate any particular aspect of my current self. I'll just be normal, nice-guy me.
---
If I do manage to garner a following, it will be folks wanting a nostalgia trip without having to dedicate the time or effort. I'll stick to a strict streaming schedule so maybe they'll tune in the same time each week to see how OUR dwarf warrior is progressing. 
---
I’ve been thinking the same thing

I started playing WoW the winter before TBC came out. The cold helped sell things a bit better when leveling in Dun Morogh 
---
Fans help immensely.  
---
At least they do in Texas
---
Based on the fact it in the modern engine it probably has the same anti-botting built in as retail so you may still get caught without player input. As far as I know most fish bots are no longer "safe" to run.
---
Nay
---
I think the time between releasing the server name list and launch is very sensitive. Giving it now would be too far in advance IMO. People would analyze and organize so much I fear it would end up with a couple super high pop servers that everyone wanted to coordinate to be on. It should be info that comes out much closer to launch IMO.
---
Yes apparently there was a big ban wave in October. this is exactly why I would create a second account on a different computer to run it. 
---
The week before gets in front of the Prelease and seems a bit more logical for that reason. “If people really like Classic then they aren’t going to go back to FF14 when Shadowbringers launches a week later”
---
I wouldn't ever call Skarm "the best of the best". I tanked with him for a bit when he was doing his guild hopping crap.
---
Dude is a massive asshat with no respect for anyone else who likes to talk out of his ass. He was never in any major progression guilds despite playing at the time of progression on that server because most high end guilds blacklisted him for being a toxic shithead that lowered raid quality.
---
I imagine the only reason he's in these runs is because all the mostly competent and competitive tanks already moved on to other servers and he was what was left. He would regularly swap in his alts and stop MTing because he wanted loot on his alts and would take loot from progession raiders for toons not used in progression. 
---
Kind of sad to see him get publicity tbh.
---
Thanks for the response. 
---
I refuse to use that elf bow on a dwarf. 
---
Botting is still pretty rampant in retail. Blizzard bans in waves, but the day after the ban, new bots are back. It is not something they can do a whole lot about without devoting a ton of resources to. You can't even kill them these days with the stupid PvP changes. 
---
At least in classic, if you are on a PvP server, you can take out some frustration and hopefully negatively impact bots - unless they are your own faction :(
---
Game tokens will turn classic into a pay to play model. 
---
Its a no for me, dog.
---
Eleven has one too? I know 14 has Shadowbringers
---
SquareEnix thinks so too
---
Yes. This one
---
I liked it when it came out because que times were faster.   If it’s there I’ll be fine with it, if it’s not I’ll also be fine with it.
---
how is it any different to retail? https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b5rcjg/breakdown_of_the_class_comp_used_by_the_top_8/
---
there is a big difference between "viable" and "optimal" which most players dont seem to get. you can clear most content with groups of only paladins, only druids or what ever, but it is simply not optimal. just like nowadays, there are just some speccs that dont have a place in an optimal setup, yet they are still viable. as enhancement shaman you can pull off dps similar to a hunter in high endcontent, ferals rank even slightly higher, but fury warriors, rogues, mages and warlocks are the optimal choice for most of the dps slots. most hybrids have tools to increase the dps of those optimal dps classes which make them viable in the first place
---
Hopefully they will limit it to standard letters and bar those ridiculous special characters.
---
Uhhh T hotkey, tab + t, queue any attack to initiate auto attack? 👏👏👏🤦‍♂️
---
Always could, and always lame.

Oh and this one here was taken over seas

Have to be honest, deciding on AV 1,12, deciding not to have RPPVP servers, potentially having DHKs and CRBGs. My hype is waning.
---
🥒💦
---
Short answer : Horde 
---
Long answer : Alliance have a better early levelling experience lets pretend you're playing a human - Your starting area will take 20 - 30 minutes depending on how well you go, One of the faster starting areas. you can then get to 11 in the first zone by the 2 hour mark. You will then grind/ do the easy quests to 14 hearth pick up the quest to drop shit off in Stormwind and the defias chain ( which offers a truck load of XP just for talking to random people and the escort ) once you've done the Defias chain you still have half of Westfall left but you will now be 15 and can go to Loch Modan till 19 then back to westfall for 20 into red ridge and thats assuming you're skipping instances to get ahead of the pack, so you're 20 before horde are even 15.  
---
While horde have to go to The Barens then to silverpine then back to barens then back to silverpine into Hillsbrand or Stonetalon you spend a lot of time doing nothing going between the two where as Alliance have a smoother early levelling experience due to all the low level zones being together compared to horde.
---
September is autumn though
---
classic will ruin pservers. Hopefully it will be worth it.
---
&gt;possibility
---
but this is Blizzard we're talking about
---
You need more than 50 characters?
---
Idk about rampant. The money comes from another player, but it does move it from a hoarder that was going to sit on it to a player that's going to inject it into the economy, so there definitely would be inflation, just don't know how much. Did they create a ton of inflation when they were introduced in retail? I mean there was already so much inflation between vanilla and wowtokens that I wouldn't know.

**&lt;undecided&gt; Semi-HC [PVP] [A] **  🇪🇺 
---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
-	We are an international group of currently 22 people, consisting of various backgrounds. We have both (very) experienced and (very) inexperienced members.
---
-	We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
-	While it wasn’t common back in the day, we are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
-	Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
-	As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values. 
---
**Guild Structure**
---
-	We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
-	Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers. 
---
-	Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate. 
---
**Raid information**
---
-	Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
-	Loot distribution system will be voted on by the majority before launch (leaning towards Loot Council)
---
-	While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required, but people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly
---
**About you**
---
-	No matter if you are a single person or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you. 
---
-	Do you want to push damage meters and optimize but don’t have the time like you did 15 years ago? Then you’d find yourself right at home.
---
-	Do you just want to go through the content at your own pace and just want to have a nice community to play with? Then we‘d definitely suit you.
---
-	Do you just want to play something that you didn’t have the opportunity back then while not being treated as a second class citizen? Again, then this project is you’re looking for.
---
For any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)

---
&gt;  You can't even kill them these days with the stupid PvP changes. 
---
What did they change? why cant you pvp them anymore?
---
The issue being that if they decide to keep sharding activated, but not on RP servers, then roleplayers who chose PVP servers are screwed. But then again, leveling up on a RP or PVP server and then have that time/effort wasted when they decide to finally open up RPPVP servers will suck donkey balls.
---
Ion needs to wake the F up and smell the desire for RPPVP. Either that or they need to put someone in his position that can actually see the game beyond the raids.
---
It is often hugely beneficial to write this kind of stuff down, and put it out there publicly, to help crystallise your own thoughts. It provides another perspective, and even if it only reinforces your initial inclination, it's all for the good.
---
I think, that as long as there are new players who want to try out classic there will continue to be new players level characters. I don' think the issue of leveling zones emptying out is as much of an issue as you're thinking. I think the other reason people push back against your idea is that adding new servers splits the population further instead of helping to sustain existing realms. 
---
It's true you could theoretically "merge" the servers together. That comes with it's own downsides though. It can mess with server economies, characters can wind up needing name changes, it can cause upheavals in terms of faction balance on a given server and raise demand of consumables due to limited node vs sudden population surges.
---
Additionally, one of the big selling points to vanilla for a lot of people is the sense of "Community". I think a lot of the players with a vested interest in that would be uncomfortable with the servers they've spent months getting to know are suddenly flooded with strangers they've never interacted with before.
---
I think Lupos will definitely fall into the "1.12 itemization" they are doing. Those private servers who "relived" the mistakes of Classic like some weird history lesson are the only places where you get stupid broken shadow dmg Lupos.
---
This was the most fun quest line in Vanilla, IMO.  Myself and a group of guildies went through it and had a blast.  Even if your main toon is decked in raid epics, you can do the quest line for an alt, or for an offspec set for your main.  I completed it on my prot warrior main, and used the Heroism set as his DPS set.  And I did it on my alt elemental shaman...  it's a pretty good elemental set, if I remember, and it looked badass.
---
Something fun to do between raids...
---
Serious...?
---
They’re great. And in this hypothetical situation, each group would have multiple shamans and therefore dps groups could have grave of air and tranquil air and mana regen and fire resist, etc. But boosting feral dps isn’t the only objective of this hypothetical raid, and paladins just have more useful toys for dealing with raid situations (consecration for AoE pulls and the best mana efficiency of any healer). Unfortunately fire nova won’t deal with AoE packs and chain lightning has a 6 sec CD and only hits 3 targets. 
---
Thanks for the response. Another couple questions - if you happen know :
---
Are pets from level 10 just as strong as pets 50+? Would it be dumb to keep the same pet or will it be the same?
---
Also is there some sort of notification that you have learned claw rank 2 or just gotta check the apples until they are there ?
---
It definitely injects more gold into the economy. Without wowtokens the rich people would probably just sit on their money, but if they spend it on wowtokens that money is going to someone who is going to use it. Obviously not every single person that buys one is rich and would be sitting on it, but as a trend more money will move as a result. I don't know how much inflation that causes.
---
Skarm's approach for tanking is for the top 1% of the guilds and for raids on farming status only.
---
Prot spec Warrior tanks are the ONLY reliable way to go in Classic, regardless of the guild. The Fury/Prot build that Skarm advocates for, is not going to work in Classic, like it does on private servers. And here is why : 
---
\-Fury/Prot build , without heavy /sit usage is going to be BELLOW Prot Warrior, with shield, in Threat, while Survivability will be WAY BELLOW a Prot Warrior with shield.
---
\-Fury/Prot Threat is only like 15% more than a Deep Prot Shield Slam build. Without /sit, the Fury/Prot build losses almost 20% Threat, because the Fury/Prot Warrior threat works ONLY if he will have the 25% damage buff from Enrage.
---
\-A Fury/Prot tank without World Buffs will have massive issues surviving raid bosses. A Prot Warrior will not. In Classic, as opposite private servers...you can't just go back to Org or Jojomba and get the world buffs again...because they will be on CD. One wipe, and the Fury/Prot Warrior becomes irrelevant. Without the 5% Crit bonus from Rallying Cry, the Threat output will be on par with a Deep Prot Warrior.
---
\-The usage of Fury/Prot tanks will be acceptable ONLY for top guilds AND ONLY AFTER the raid is on speed FARMING status. No guild, even the top of the top guilds, will use Fury/Prot Warriors as tank during progress.
---
Looking at everything of the above, become clear that raid tanking, for 99% of the content, will be EXCLUSIVE to Protection Warriors, be it 17/3/31 build or 14/5/32 build. Only after the raid is on speed farming status and only for the most hardcore guilds, with heavy usage of World Buff , flasks and consumables, Fury/Prot spec COULD be used for main tanking.
---
But, it would be stupid to do it, because /sit won't work in Classic, and Prot Warriors will have HIGHER threat and MUCH HIGHER survivability anyway.
---
The same is for Druid tanks. They are better than Fury/Prot Warriors...but still bellow Prot Warriors. However, Druid tanks will have a slight advantage for raids that are on farming status, their threat being slightly better than Prot Warriors.
---
Even so, with a Druid tank, the speed of a raid will be, AT BEST, 5-10 min faster than with a Prot Warrior.
---
Private servers are irrelevant.
---
/sit won't work in Classic, and without Enrage, Fury Warrior threat is BELLOW Prot Warriors.
---
Thanks for the response! Love your content and this talk with Tips...
---
My raid tanking experience was only in TBC, and I was undergeared as an alt for the stuff I was tanking for my progression guild, so I didn't have too much trouble with rage since I was getting hit pretty hard (think #2 tank in ZA with partial Kara gear). And from that experience, HS was key on the fights where I had a lot of rage because I could dump the rage off faster by queueing up HS while the other abilities were weaved in on GCD (basically spam 3-4-5: Sunder,SS,Revenge). But for trash, 5 mans, Kara, etc I always prioritized Sunder over HS because of rage starvation, and idk how similar that was to vanilla
---
I am likely going to roll either warrior or druid in Classic, just a matter of if I want the ability to heal sometimes... And your videos on both those classes and the fresh perspective it brings outside of the 'common knowledge' you find regurgitated everywhere is very motivating
---
Side question: which of these specs, if any, would you recommend for PvP on the side? Or is it just going to be too painful and I should farm up the gold for respecs. Not going for HWL with a raid spec, but just for some city raids and general tomfoolery. Can I pull some Swifty dw shenanigans with fury/prot?
---
bc it‘s his movie
---
It will still enable auto attack. For example changing your sinister strike key to a macro like:  
---
 /script if not IsCurrentAction(24) then UseAction(24) end;   
---
 /cast Sinister Strike (Rank x)
---
Then it will normally start auto attack and cast sinister strike. If sinister strike is on cooldown, it will enable auto attack and not cast sinister strike and give you the "still on cooldown" message from attempting to cast.
---
Oh wait so 7.3.5 is the modern client?  
---
Because I thought that was an older client.  
---
It's already going to be "in classic" in the sense that people can buy tokens on retail, redeem them for game time, and then play classic with that game time. As for them actually putting the tokens within classic, I don't think that will happen because the way they have it set up now indirectly pushes people to play retail if they want free game time.
---
Crail, that name is familiar.  I was in morbo, if that guild name rings any bells. 
---
I think pets are normalized per level. So a pet tamed at level 10 (and leveled to 50) will be the same strength, health, etc. as a pet tamed at level 50 when they are both level 50.
---
I'm not sure if there is a notification.
---
No I don't think anyone has anything wrong.  
---
And I don't have any hopes or cares about the client that's being used.  
---
I am just looking for concrete proof that we're using this client or that. People tend to cite 7.3.5 as the client, but they only do that because the demo was using that client version.  
---
Ah, the Strat speed run.  That was no joke.  I tanked it multiple times for groups.
---
Yes, survivability wise, there isn't any advantage...unless you consider Shield Slam.
---
Shield Slam have massive threat, more than ANYTHING a Fury Warrior could do with 20 rage. The Fury tanks MUST be permanently crited, and /sit won't work in Classic.
---
Without /sit, they lose Enrage, and with that, they lose 25% damage, which means they lose about 30% threat. They will be crited from time to time, but not even half as much as they would be with /sit.
---
The Fury Warr tank will lose over 15% of the threat that he have on private servers with /sit.
---
And that will put it BELLOW Shield Slam Warrior builds with Impale.
---
And without threat, Fury Warrior tanks become IRRELEVANT.
---
That's a good point about Impale, Skarm did mention that it doesn't apply to white hits. So many things to factor into the calculations...
---
You're just not gonna be working after August? 
---
F you.
---
Not sure if he ever tried with an Alliance toon though?
---
Fury Warriors work ONLY because usage of /sit....which allows them them to have permanent Enrage, which is 25% more damage, which is 30% more threat.
---
/sit won't work in Classic, and Fury Warr tanks will be on par with Shield Slam builds with Impale, while having a stupidly low survivability.
---
Private servers meta WILL NOT EXIST in Classic.
---
Considering the untamed nature of most Horde lands I'm going to make an Orc Hunter to experience the horde side of things. I'll also make him an engineer for maximum fun. 
---
it's going to be soo much worse in classic.  only need a sub to play, that cuts out the latest xpac prices.  gold will be in higher demand because consumables relative power is a lot higher than retail.  no tokens means anybody on the fence can only fall to the side of breaking ToS, increasing supply of illegitimate goldbuyers, raising demand for goldfarmers.  as a whole the goldfarm business is way bigger than it was back then.  
---
pretty much the only thing we'll have going for us is i don't think the hackers that can teleport around under the maps exist anymore?  (more a wrath thing from what i remember, but i haven't seen that kinda thing in bfa)
---
If Blizzard's goal with loot trading was to reduce the amount of CS work necessary to solve loot issues and thus save money, then implementing tokens does not work. Here's why:  
---
You will see a very large group of people return to private servers and thus not subscribing to Classic. If someone as tolerant as me would do that, then there are many many thousands ahead of me who would as well.  
---
The money you thought you saved on CS by implementing a WoW token, will be lost in the form of subscriptions me and thousands of other people won't be paying.  
---
WHAT IS A WARRIOR
---
I'm def maining a Druid now having seen [how crazy they are in PvP}(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa_ckQqcZyc), and I want to tank 5-mans and off-tank raids, if lucky. Don't mind being Resto though.
---
I see what you’re doing here. You just want to play... JK Betas can’t hurt especially if they have slightly different engines and sharding in the beginning.
---
Even if you don’t get a mount exactly at 40 it shouldn’t be a huge deal. You still have aspect of the pick, and can get it improved in the BM tree. I’d say don’t worry about it too much since you’ll probably have the money shortly after 40, if not by then. 
---
Amazing post. It's so cool that we're going in to classic with such a wealth of information. I'm curious to see how much is correct on the number side of things considering p-servers can never be 100% sure.
---
More proof that mages are OP.
---
Princess is easy for a druid. For Rottgrip you need good rng and luffa.
---
I don't think we need to worry about this. If they feel the need to have a beta for classic then they will have one, if not then I trust them to have the situation under control. Doing all the work they have done up until now with the risks involved just to let classic be absolutely riddled with bugs doesn't make much sense.
---
Just go through the cave from ashenvale?
---
We’ll have a page up in the next week or so, and I’ll dm you with the info no problem 
---
I'll concede that I don't have the insight you appear to have regarding the state of botting in BfA, so I'll take you at your word.
---
I just expect Blizzard to have identified this as particularly harmful to Classic and hope they will invest a lot of resources to deal with it where possible. 
---
I would like an answer to this from OP. 
---
Why did you use 'then' rather than 'than'?
---
Pack your bags, boys. The war’s over. 
---
I've done extensive research on this topic too. We're almost in the same boat and want to do the exact same content. 
---
HOTW spec (30/21) is what you're after. Tank and DPS 5 mans, heal raids up to BWL (maybe even that) with a healing set, do a good job PVPing too. Google Druid HOTW lvl, there's a couple of great guides on YouTube.
---
Not to mention his new epic gear he got in the second expansion.
---
Imagine if they had flying mounts in the original. Damn would have saved a lot of traveling time to BRM.
---
Blizzard will see that your second account send gold to your first and will ban both.
---
Tl;dr
---
I’m on them every day and I haven’t been subbed in over a year soooo.... how is that possible?
---
It wasn’t a vanilla feature, I believe. 
---
The first character I made was in the first week in December 2004. He was a Human Paladin named Malren, on Arthas US PVP, about two weeks later (playing alot) at 25 I gave up, the pally leveling process was became too much for me. A few years later in the summer of 2006 I made an undead rogue named Hellstrider (lol so dumb) on Korgath US PVP and dinged 60 in the TBC prepatch. 
---
On a side note I had no idea that Korgath was home to DnT and Drama both Alliance uber raid guilds, and Gentleman's Club on Horde equally uber. I came here b/c a friend was playing here. With classic coming out it's really got me excited to feel proud of my server again, and to hopefully be part of one of those uber guilds. 
---
Side question: if you are e night elf, do you have to make the trek to westfall or can you stay local through level 30ish?
---
No it isnt. Even without enrage fury warrior threat is very far ahead of prot warriors. The mt in my guild isnt using sit macro and he is able to do up to 2x more threat with his fury build.
---
I think it would be pretty hard to find a spec that checks more boxes than sm/ruin warlock.
---
Yea I figured that out a lil late. Been heavily doing my research for this one because I don't want to risk losing account. So far fishmonger looks like the best, still speculating. Hard to find any discussion really
---
Im pretty sure it wasnt added until after i started playing (Wrath).  I was just curious if it was in the demo or not.
---
I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of a stress test would be? They'll be running Classic on their modern infrastructure on which they have millions of players logging into daily. They know it works, and they know its limitations etc.
---
Since when 1700 &gt; 2250 ?
---
Ya, I was a dick in vanilla.... Viscous little teenage scoundrel. I worked my way into one of the top raiding guilds in the server, mostly so I could gank people with impunity due to massively out gearing them. I rolled a PvP server to be a dick.
---
you have some of the saltiest dumbest logic...
---
Wowclassiccountdown.com
---
hey me too! First day of summer babies!
---
That's not un-true.
---
I agree. It seems impossible to catch all bugs. The whole idea with recreating 1.12 by using a modern client seems pretty risky. 
---
Private servers used the old client. They didn't get everything right but at least there are were no gamebreaking bugs in the patched content or live events. Pretty impressive when you think of the how blizzards classic demo was. 
---
Gold selling and gold buying will always exist, there is nothing that can be done to counter it, just accept it and deal with it.
---
I recall Blizzard saying multiboxing will be against ToS
---
Two fo the original devs already said that it was a design choice. Stop stating that it was only capped by hardware. You are spreading misinformation. 
---
Always kinda cool how old reviews describe the combat as "fast paced".
---
I'm against tokens appearing on classic realms. I understand the reasons it was implemented, but I agree with another comment that Blizzard might lean more toward "hey, guys, play BFA and buy tokens to pay your sub so you can enjoy both game" route. Additionally, I think it would sit so poorly with the Classic WoW playerbase that it could cost more players than it would gain.
---
If you want to pay for your WoW retail+classic subscription, I'm of the opinion that you can do so easily enough in BFA. It's an entirely different game people are surely adult enough to appreciate for what it is and have some fun farming a token once a month if they can't or won't pay for a sub.
---
I mean to be fair he was essentially carrying the team. None of the other party members were essentially angels, going up against another type of angel.
---
Same, I kept my character parked in that damn tree for literally days til I got my first Humar. I've never felt right with another pet.
---
Ummmm...
---
The fact that you don't even mention flurry just tells me all I need to know about you lol
---
imp expose armor is 2550
---
I had the honor of killing that fucker many times but god damn he was hard to kill. He was over geared and he had a million bubbles, LoH and pocket healers... Good old Shattered Hand server. We also had to fight Death and Taxes. The odds were stacked against us for sure.
---
Don't forget his new title "the White" for being rezzed.
---
Ahh got it. Thanks. Never played Fury before, hopefully if i'm not called to tank this go around, I'll give it a go.
---
Gandalf is a Wizard/Mage who routinely uses his CC abilities though. How many MMO Wizards/Mages even put those skills on their toolbars?
---
Ah, I see your a man of culture as well.  
---
I'm so happy that you have such knowledge of the full classic release and exactly how everything will work for certainty and are only now sharing this with us would u care to explain what source this is from how you know for a fact that it will be as you described and would you care to elaborate on your information that clearly everyone else is oblivious to?
---
The last 25% of Sep is autumn, yes.
---
See I actually wouldn't mind TBCs version of LFG. Where there is no auto grouping really too it. Essentially just a board to say if you're Looking for a group for a specific dungeon. Yes, you can just use world chat, but if I'm questing and looking for a group chances are I'm going to miss an LFM in the mix of zone chat and a 99% of world chat that doesn't pertain to me. For example, I'm 25 LFG for RFK, but 99% of world chat is people trying to get a group for Mara, looking for a Tank for Scholo, Trying to find a seller for some LW craft, etc.
---
DM is phase 2.
---
Fall starts Sep 23rd. Even if it drops before the 23rd, we're literally talking about the last week or two of summer lol.
---
A result of more people wanting to do big dick DPS with warriors, rogues, and mages.
---
Tanks, however....
---
I'm not crying. It's allergies. 
---
Mc isn’t hardcore, is cleared with a casual guild with a decent understanding in like 2 hours. At the beginning it will probably be more around 3h. But once you have bwl and Mc on farm you can clear them both in about 3 hours with a casual guild that knows what they’re doing. Mc pugs will be a thing so will be easy to get in on those if you miss your guild runs. Those last around the same time, anywhere between 2-4h. 
---
As for making money. As a priest main I run tailoring/arch usually. Farm Dm-e lashers an make anywhere from 40-80g/h. Until DM comes out I’ll probably roll herbalism doe
---
You don't know how Deep Prot tanking actually works. Rage issues? For RAID BOSSES? Are you kidding me? The maximum rage a Deep Prot Warr needs for almost maximum threat is 15 rage every 3 seconds. And 15 rage every 3 seconds when taking raid bosses is not an issue.
---
10 rage for Shield Block and 5 rage for Revenge. That is ALL you need for the BEST usage of threat for rage. 
---
And raid bosses will provide more than 15 rage every 3 seconds...while your white attacks will provide an additional 5-8 rage with every attack.
---
&gt;  In this regard, it's also not always necessary to spend rage on Shield Block every 5 seconds if you're not taking a lot of damage to begin with 
---
Except that you want to have Shield Block ALWAYS up, regardless of the damage taken...because Revenge is the BEST threat generator that Prot Warriors have.
---
ive actually tested this on a 1.12 server and if the ability you have on the macro is on cooldown it will not enable autoattack 
---
I haven't had any interest in playing WoW since Wrath - even though I have come back to play every expansion (BfA is the only expansion I haven't played). I look back on that now, and see that my few months played each expansion was just an attempt to find that magic that I first felt in vanilla and the first half of TBC.
---
I have tried many other MMOs since then (Warhammer, Age of Conan, Rift, Tera, Secret World, Guild Wars 2, Elder Scrolls) but nothing ever really hit the right spot. Some did things much better than vanilla WoW, but they also did some things much more poorly. Nothing really followed those same design principles. We know now, through interviews and articles from the guys who were there, that much of WoW's success was unintended - a mere happy accident that the development went in certain ways to make such an amazing game.
---
It makes sense, why that lightning in a bottle had been so hard to recreate in other games. I have always been looking for that right mix and just not found it. So when Classic was announced it became the only game I was interested in playing.
---
I agree wholeheartedly that the current Blizzard is but a pale shadow of its former self. Which is a great shame, but the game of classic still exists. It is a time capsule, everything that made it great is still there. No new Blizzard employee, who has little understanding of MMO design, will be creating new content. 
---
I have plenty of tokens banked up, enough for 10 months of play and enough gold for another 13 months. 
---
My hope is that the popularity of Classic shows game developers that the current "Wham Bam Thank You Maam" game design is fine for some, but there is a large audience out there wanting something very different. Then we might get someone come along who will actually create a game for those people. Not every game needs to have 10 million players. Not every game needs to pull in 3 billion dollars of microtransaction money a year. 
---
There are already games that do this, and the people who like that are catered to and satisfied, but there is a large market of people who are just sitting in the wings, waiting, money-in-hand, for the right game to come along. 
---
There are some games that sounded, at one point, like they might fit the bill: Ashes of Creation and Pantheon. Ashes seems to have had some serious identity problems and an overabundance of cash-shop items (for a game months/years from release) and Pantheon just looks a little... off, to me. 
---
So unfortunately, all my eggs are in the one basket. I have plans to play Classic until someone actually does come up with a better game. My expectation is that will take many years, if at all. Classic will fit the bill for me.
---
I hope you make the right choice for you, and focus on what brings you joy. That is really the most important choice. You're an adult, you can make your own decisions about your life and what makes you happy. 
---
Ret Paladin tanks are viable until about mid-way through leveling. After that, they need more talents from the prot tree to keep up with the increasing DPS from the group.
---
Didn't you see how buggy the demo was?
---
&gt; Thanks for using a 1994 movie to make a meme for a 2004 game  
---
...that is going to be released in 2019.
---
Blizzard quality. Some people's accounts are bugged and they can still post.
---
Quote from Blizzard CM's support ticket response:
---
&gt;This is Game Master Zwagilo here at your service! Thank you so much for your patience so far. I sure hope this message reaches you in good health and spirits.
---
&gt;So you do need a level 10 or higher **with an active subscription to properly post** - If this isn't showing it is most likely due to the activity of the character you are trying to use. Make sure you have game time, relog into that character, and it should help update things for you to properly post. :) 
---
Maybe you should let Blizzard know so they can properly deactivate your posting privileges?
---
Could you explain to me please, in great detail, what does a shield do?
---
That's pretty clever!
---
I might be rolling Dwarf Priest so I'll keep this in mind!!
---
How much of this even applies outside of private servers? "Well jeez you need as much threat as possible to keep up your fully world buffed fury warriors who are hitting mobs with incorrect armor values", ok in a situation where shit doesn't work right then you need to sacrifice absolutely everything for 100% threat, but what about a server with correct armor values and a cooldown on things like ony buff? And what about actually surviving? How much of the boss stats are accurate for that? For how many bosses will DW tanking actually work with on classic? And what about fury tanking? You aren't going to be able to trigger that 25% damage buff whenever you want. So will it still be as good?
---
This is what I have been thinking. I don't have time and reliable availability to progress to naxx but I can follow someone elses journey 
---
I am definitely positively 100% squarely in the "fresh servers" camp. If the initial batch of servers all have Naxx on farm and will never, ever progress again and just stagnate, the long-term health and popularity of the game will suffer.
---
That said I don't think they should just roll out new servers all willy nilly. Once all content is consumed across all existing servers by a certain percentage of the active playerbase, perhap then and only then is it time to entertain the idea of opening new realms or copying everyone to a permanent no-wipe realm and restarting the original servers.
---
It's vitally important that two things are taken into consideration for "seasonal" servers to work.
---
1. "Fresh hype" is a thing and can kill established servers. All server options must have reached a point where content is cleared and farmed by a number of players on a regular basis. Probably no sooner than every 3 years.
---
2. People who want to opt out must--ABSOLUTELY MUST--be able to not only opt out, but have a means to preserve their characters, character names, progress, etc and continue playing the very static, finalized version they prefer to play. Not everybody is keen on the idea of rerolling on a new server. A lot of people don't like doing it. It was a huge inconvenience for blacklisted players in vanilla for a reason and a lot of people would understandably be put off by this.
---
Early leveling for Alliance is so much easier.  Yeah, Duskwood and Wetlands may be "contested" territory, but there are virtually no horde quests in either zone, and no horde outposts.  Meanwhile, Horde has to deal with Alliance constantly in Hillsbrad, Stonetalon, and Ashenvale.  Thousand needles is about the only "safe" horde option to get you into your 30s.  After that everything pretty much starts to come together.
---
I have the same concern. Funds aren't great for me so buying a new computer isn't really possible. The worst is I can't play current content since my PC is so old. I hope this doesn't plague me more.
---
Depends on if he was making people do it or if they just wanted to help. A guy in my guild when I was on horde went to rank 14 and while we never did this, everyone was always happy to help in any way we could because he was our friend. I don't think anyone would have minded doing this stuff either.
---
You wouldn't be considered a hardcore raiding guild if that's your branding goal.  
---
I will be raiding hardcore in Classic, but do I love world buffs?  
---
I think the massive amount of world buff stacking that was allowed in vanilla was one of the worst designs in the entire game, right up there with human sword skill and dishonorable kills.  
---
As much as this sub ( Me included ) Likes memeing Tips, I actually do think the few grind spot videos hes uploaded are pretty accurate and useful. There are only like 4 vids atm though.
---
I imagine I'd join. World Buffs sound incredibly tedious.
---
Because, your face
---
How so?  Alliance have wetlands and duskwood with zero horde presence as far as leveling is concerned.  Not counting high level gankers wanting to be dicks.
---
Yes you can, you have to go to Darnassus and take the portal to Ru'theran Village, then take the boat for Auberdine, then take the boat for Stormwind.

---
That sums it up. Bots are not going to turn on war mode so you can't kill them. It threw me for a loop when I came back recently to stock up on gold in preparation for classic and saw that everyone's name was orange instead of red.
---
Maybe! I wasn't in Morbo though. I was one of the early levelers and one of our members was almost server first max level. He no-lifed super hard and even found an epic two handed axe! He had a good lead but somewhere around the high 40s/early 50s he suddenly stopped playing to remake on a friends server. I was in a guild formed on the worldofwar net website. WWN! A group of people on the diabloii net forums started the guild if I recall or at least a group of people came from there. This was before the game launched. We were dual faction, had a WWN branch on both sides. Sometime during vanilla someone reported our name as "advertising websites" and we were forced to change it. For a short time we were &lt;Guild of the Monkey&gt; and  &lt;Guild of the Whale&gt;. We absorbed a smaller guild into our ranks &lt;Strength in Honor&gt; and we asked the old leader if we could use that name, he agreed. SiH is still around to this day but is much smaller and has little groups in several MMOs/games.
---
Also completely botched the meme just for added levels of "damned kids"
---
That's actually exactly the plan for my hunter once Classic launches; hit level 10, train Tame Pet then suicide-run her up Teldrassil to nab both an owl (because rarity) and a level 1 nightsaber from Shadowglen (because nostalgia).
---
It'll certainly be time consuming compared to just taming something in Mulgore or the Barrens, and I expect it'll likely be somewhat tedious to get through Auberdeen and Darnassus, but it shouldn't be terribly difficult, I don't think.
---
Unless, of course, you're doing it on a PvP server.
---
...which I will be.
---
Ah well, just makes for greater bragging rights.
---
"And the horde is clearing it."
---
Are you assuming my faction?!
---
They don't devote the resources to it in retail (relying on automated systems to identify) so they are not likely to devote more to Classic, which has a tiny team and which they have stated will not receive much attention - they do not want to run two MMOs.
---
At least on PvP realms we can kill bots of the opposing faction. Without tokens though (still not confirmed they won't be a thing) people may very well revert to the old system of illegal gold buying, making bots just as lucrative in Classic. 
---
It is one of the reasons why a lot of people want DM farming to be killed off for Classic, as this generates a ton of gold and is instanced so cannot be stopped by diligent players.
---
Well I’ve admitted to it more than once and I’m going strong. Go to that link and click blue post for that post. Ythisens says classic forum is free.

A famous walk for night elves, have fun dying a few times OP
---
It's true but Online Gaming has come a long way. I mean, look at other MMOs. Move up to enemy. Hack. Hack. Hack. Hack. Compared with that kiting enemies, positioning ETC. was fast paced. 
---
I feel like a lot of people understand the implications of wanting to be a dps Warrior now. Lots of time investment compared to other classes to perform at a peak. But maybe I’m wrong. 
---
Not sure, I've seen other people talking about Alliance having to hop around more than Horde so probably have to go to Westfall
---
Lol was so high I forgot how to use punctuation.... Gg
---
I watched that Skarm video and there's a lot of good info there. I agree with the improved revenge, but my takeaway from it was that most of what he's saying applies to wanna be try hards, not the average player. 
---
So it's basically going to mess with all the inexperienced players who may never have tanked in vanilla before. They're gonna go in there, speccing prot/fury, thinking they're hardcore and going to have problems.
---
For me personally, I go with the prot with impale build. You keep your shield on but gain some threat from the arms talents. 
---
It's crazy to me that the Night Elves were originally supposed to be Horde. When they realized the Alliance had zero beach heads on Kalimdor. They moved them to Alliance. How crazy is that? Get Rekt kido's 
---
Oh get over yourself. Acting like you just trolled people. Get better at being wrong
---
I think in raids druids just spam rank 4 healing touch (at least until they have the gear to spam downranked regrowth crits) so the HoT stacking shouldnt be a problem.
---
Strange, because it worked fine for massive amount of time I sunk into my rogue. Maybe you had cast ss before the script and that caused the script to not execute if ss fails? Or maybe it could be private server differences. Guess we'll find out in official Classic
---
lol I used to do the same thing. I started making my own that would just reposition or resize UI elements and hide a lot of the artwork. Very lightweight, no increased loading times, and it covered most of the basics.
---
You sure he didn't just re-spec Arcane?
---
The journey is a long one, but know that you walk in the footsteps of many before you. Once you arrive in the snowy fountains of Dun Morough, it shall get easier, and the verdant and tranquil forests of Elywnn are worth it so some. Best of luck OP.
---
Whoa, thats crazy
---
Not sure if it works in classic, but if you swim along the northern shoreline west of menthil, you can drown yourself and port to a GY in the dwarven starting area. It’s only slightly shorter, but running through dun morogh is easier than wetlands and loch modan due to lower level mobs and dieing and such
---
Rare Recipes will be bought out instantly by bots/auto keypress macros unless something is done about it. Reselling limited stock recipes leaves a sour taste in my mouth...
---
No it never worked while the primary ability was on cooldown. This is why they implemented /startattack in the first place.
---
If you are a Paladin you can AOE farm the Crypt in Western Plaguelands for pretty easy 25g-30g an hour. Mobs are the right level for Edgemaster's Handguards to drop too.
---
I remember using diabloii! And I remember sih.  Medivh community was pretty tight back then.  It was fun, but overpopulation took its toll eventually.  Technical problems drove away the bigger progression guilds. Hope I see some of the old folks around in classic.
---
“Fly you fools!” But Gandalf it’s vanilla, we don’t have flying mounts until TBC...noob.
---
Yeah?
---
Yea that’s fine, in no way do any of us have enough time to hardcore raid :)
---
Slightly? It's WAY faster haha.  
---
Like, it's a shame watching night elves run through Wetlands when you know this trick.  
---
What they said was “September is Autumn”.  September is Summer and Fall in a 23/8 allocation of days per season.
---
The comment prior specified during the exact time frame that summer concludes within that day.  So I don’t really know what your point is.
---
Still, doing it at level 1 isn't a bad idea, he can probably get a couple of levels and unlock useful flight paths early on like the ones in Menethil, Loch Modan, SW and IF.
---
I guess a castsequence macro will do in that case, but I’m not sure 
---
It would be silly if they did not name the servers. The number scheme was just for the demo.
---
Would be nice to roll on a new shinny Steamwheedle again
---
Thanks everyone for anwers &lt;3 
---
I like your video information. But it would be a lot better if you put a paper bag over your head. I think this could be a break through point if you did that.
---
You would think, so... What with how many druid threads there are every day.
---
Honestly this kind of really really motivates me to hit level 5 as soon as possible. Then form a mob or orcy bois to terrorize all the elves making the run. Love killing knife ears with me bois.
---
You,re*
---
There are basic systems (and tuning) that would benefit greatly form a beta.
---
* What population cap can support a healthy server in 2019? Could we have 5,000 player servers in a healthy way? What changes would need to be made to make that happen?
---
* How should mob respawns work? Should the timer be flat rate? marginal (e.g. increasing in increments of players)? dynamic (e.g. increasing by each player)? (This would need to increase ***if*** server population caps increase)
---
* How should herb/node respawns work? How many black lotus should be made available? (This would need to increase ***if*** server population caps increase)
---
Above being said -- I'm 3,000% happy with old-school server numbers.
---
I'd be super cool with 2000ish population caps with server queues on login. It'd tickle my nostalgia, and it makes sure respawns are plentiful for folks that want to level / herb. But it's hard to see that happening in this day and age. Streamers, discord communities, subreddits.... It feels like bliz will increase pop cap a bit to me. And if they *do*, that needs to be tested in a big way.
---
Just indicative of how far WoW has strayed from the original design over the course of 15 years.
---
They did launch several new servers during vanilla, when subscription were still increasing after a year of release, probably due to the exact reason you're describing.
---
  They might however not do it this time around, since they are re-releasing the entire game. I get what you're saying, but at some point we just have to be happy with what we're getting.
---
As excited as I am I'd prefer the end of summer tbh. Hard to stay at my computer doing something that matters when everyone is outside playing in the sun
---
Until the tauren starting invading your Goldshire.
---
Good point about the crits for HS. I also need to look into how much of threat is from damage vs modifiers, because I was under the impression that Sunder, Revenge, SS, and HS bonus threat had a much larger portion of the threat than the actual damage done. But that was just a guess based on where tanks end up on damage meters, I hadn't done/seen the hard math.
---
I still think this conversation will end up being determined by the answer to my initial question, though (which I haven't seen answered, and we might not get answered until the game release and people get into MC), but: 
---
That tons of rage that you speak about from getting hit, will that be the case in Classic? I don't doubt that's the case on pservers, but I (perhaps falsely) remember rage being a lot harder to come by. If that's the case, white hits may be much more crucial for rage generation.
---
Thanks for the link I need to do some more research
---
Thanks man, I'll take a look.
---
May as well whilst you brought him up... Tips is the best example of "it's not what you know, it's who you know" knows sweet fuck all about vanilla but the dude has connections.
---
Damn I dont remember 480p looking so...terrible. 
---
100% absolutely certain. I reopened the ticket and sent that link. This is the 4th time I'm making a ticket about this, every time having received the same answer.
---
Maybe they covertly changed their policy.
---
It depends, because cast sequence wasn’t in vanilla too.
---
I'm always encouraged by accounts of others who found their pet early and stuck with it rather than chasing shiny rare skins or mechanical boosts. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course, I just appreciate loyalty. Even if it is totally irrational and placed on a virtual collection of code and polygons.
---
My first hunter's first/main pet was a nightsaber from Shadowglen. Tamed at level 1 so he'd start the same place she did. I named him Orion, and he went all the way to 50-something with her. When I eventually decided to retire the character (because I was rerolling on a different server to join some new friends), I put her in a little nook partway up one of the walls of the zone before logging out.
---
I get genuine happy feels whenever I think about the two of 'em still up there, looking down at where they first started out and thinking of how far they'd come together.
---
Once Classic launches I'm going to be playing Horde again. First thing I'm going to do with my hunter upon hitting level 10 and learning Tame Pet will be to suicide-run her/him up Teldrassil in order to get to Shadowglen and find another level 1 nightsaber to tame. I may even name him Orion again for full nostalgia points.
---
Gods, I'm such a sap. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
This is hilarious. Do you not think a deep prot warrior should ever cast Shield Slam? What do you do when Revenge is on cooldown?  
---
Why do I need to pop shield block if I already have a Revenge proc or it is on cool down? You are just bad and I can't believe you even tried to tell someone that "they don't know how deep prot tanking works".
---
Not quite. In a nutshell, certain pet types can learn from a list of skills. And some skill can be taught to different pet types. 
---
For instance, a Raptor can learn Bite, Cower, Growl, and Claw.
---
A boar can learn Bite, Charge, Cower, Dash &amp; Growl.
---
Notice that both Raptors and Boars have in common the ability to learn Bite, Cower, and Growl. So if you learn a higher rank of bite from a Raptor, you can teach a Boar that same rank of Bite.
---
"Fly you fools!"
---
This is classic, not Burning Crusade old man
---
I am saying that private servers are consistent with your recollection that you felt rage starved in early dungeons, despite that not always being the case in raid. I feel this is logical when you compare how much damage a mob in a dungeon does vs a raid. Especially if you are stacking defense which everyone was doing in Vanilla and is what you see on most prebis lists, you have rage generation issues. 
---
But yes, rage generation may be different in Classic. However, I feel that given the amount of rage I get on a p - server, it would have to be dramatically different to really make HS spamming not viable. Even then, 
---
Gold is generated by the player base farming, not an artificial generation. That is why the price rises and falls with the market. How much players are willing to spend to get the token and vice versa.
---
At least as I understand. I am by NO means an economist and I wonder if their has to be some way to protect the system, I.E. no one is buying.  Man it just hurts my head trying to think about it.
---
Makes a lot of sense...
---
The last time I played on a pserver, in leveling dungeons as a priest I was asking warriors to put on a 2h except for big pulls, because it was too boring to heal them with a shield. Factor in the increased dps and threat, I will definitely experiment with 2h/dw tanking in leveling dungeons. On my level ~45 warrior in retail vanilla I was too noob to try something like that
---
I think I might get that black raptor from WC and teach it bite / claw so it can focus dump on a target.
---
I plan on using it on a 39 twink. I know the Wind Serpents are techincally better because of swoop and an attack that ignore armor with lighting breath, but I'd just rather have a raptor.
---
DW tanking at lvl 45 will suck because you don't have hit gear. 
---
You can try 2H tanking if you have a good 2 Hander for sure.
---
I arrive back on July 16th from a month holiday in Europe. I am gonna be taking a few extra days if it is the rumoured release date.
---
I have made this run plenty of times.
---
You will likely get caught by a crocodile a few times in Wet Lands. Or shot by an orc on your way up the moutain road to Dun'Morough.
---
A few corpse runs here and there. I remember being killed by the crocs at least once and killed by the orcs a handful of times. After that, it's smooth sailing. Just takes about a half hour but well worth it. 
---
Just make sure your class has trainers available.
---
The dude you're arguing with shared so much valuable info and you're just shitting on him over semantics. You're an actual douche man lmao
---
It's extremely hard to beat a Boar for leveling. When I level a BM hunter, the general rule I follow is "If I can see it, it's mine!" What I'll actually do is target the mob I desire. Command the boar to attack and then wait until the boar actually reaches the mob and aggros it. I'll then recall my pet and let it train the aggroed mob to me. Once the mob is in range, I'll shoot until it's dead and then target another mob and command the pet to attack it.
---
And since the boar runs a hell of a lot faster than my player does, I can grab and tag mobs quite rapidly. If I have a level advantage over the mobs and am simply farming them, then I'll send the pet to aggro a mob, target another and send the pet after it, and repeat until I have 4 or 5 mobs on my pet. Then recall the pet to get the mobs in range and pew pew until they're dead.
---
Let's just say that people competing with me for certain mobs aren't exactly happy campers...
---
The razorback in durotar. Already so many mobs and if he shows up while your aggroed its a problem. 
---
I honestly see nothing wrong with that. Just because you aren’t minmaxing everything down to the way you prefer to set your keybinds doesn’t mean you arent a skilled player
---
This guy you're arguing with is an idiot. Dont worry man. Thanks for all the info.
---
The fact that you are so sure of yourself despite having no evidence at all and straight up making demonstrably false claims about fury spec without /sit just shows your lack of intelligence.
---
The idea of injecting so much gold into the economy will definitely have an effect.
---
One thing I'm really looking forward to in WoW is no more inflation caused by expansions.
---
Shit man, I logged into my level 105 character (Got there by dicking around a few summers ago otherwise I haven't played since Wrath) and the fucker had like 5000 gold in his bags.
---
5000 Gold. 105 levels. And I only played for a single month. :|
---
My friend and I ran this exact team setup back in 2004. She played a hunter and I was the druid. We had a blast. 
---
I imagine originally thinking I could run to a graveyard near IF and res there, boy I was wrong.
---
Its P2W. Spend $15, get gold, spend gold on BiS bloodvine.
---
I don't think it will be as easy for guilds to stack world buffs in Classic. I don't really think guilds are going to coordinate their raid times and head turnins to make sure everyone gets the buff on a 12 hour cooldown.
---
The other stuff is also pretty tedious to do (from all reports, never done it myself). Apparently it takes quite some time (hours of preparation) and logging off characters with warlock alts for summons, etc.
---
So I don't think anyone but hardcore guilds are going to bother with this. I think that the majority of guilds will have some people with some buffs but most people will just have regular consumes.
---
Wow that sentence just kept on going...
---
&gt;City of Heroes
---
Huh...TIL CoH was still not only active but releasing new content...
---
I now have something new I need to look into. 
---
Generally you have to spend gold to get your pre-BiS. Medallion of Grand Marshall Moris (400g), Stockade Pauldrons (250g), Boots of Avoidance (250g), Alcor's Sunrazor (what like 350g?). That adds up, and you have zero way to farm it as a Prot Warrior. Your best bet is to farm gold doing dungeon runs, or to level an alt.
---
You should wait until level 10 when you complete your class quests to be able to tame animals/pets. Otherwise you'll have to run back. Level 10 is a good time to transition to Westfall which is right beside the Human starting place, Elywnn Forest.
---
&gt; Looking for group was the primary thing that killed the WoW realm community stone dead. 
---
LFG =/= crossrealm. An LFG feature does not have to be cross-realm. Cross realm killed the community. Megaservers with huge populations killed the community. A UI element that [first appeared in TBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20090807221227/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html)  that let people queue did not do that.
---
I'd say that class balance, roles, and overall dungeon difficulty would still necessitate so much communication between the group that people too anxious and asocial to spam "lfg" in trade would still opt out of dungeons under such a system. The amount of communication back and forth when forming your group would also almost render such a UI element somewhat moot. Literally its only advantage would be not restricting your LFG search to a major city, and a global channel would solve that just as well.
---
This comment went over a lot of peoples heads but yeah, at least you semi legitimized it, haha
---
I grew up learning september is a month of autumn. June-August is summer.
---
This solstice/equinox thing is an alien concept to me...
---
I look at it like this, I level a hunter to 60. After a ~40g investment for gear (one or two good weapons), I'll have made a profit by level 60. Then, I can run DM Trib runs for gold, and if I'm lucky, a Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying drops, and I don't have to drop 800g on that.
---
Gono start calling my mana "magic juice"
---
It doesn’t.  Inflation is strictly a function of gold created by mob drops and gold destroyed by repairs and buying items off NPCs.  People buying gold comes from the “inactive supply” of Chinese gold sellers, or the “inactive supply” of people who’d hoard it.  
---
WoW tokens at least keep people buying gold from legitimate players versus Chinese wage-slave labor.
---
I remember botting:
---
I had just gotten my first gaming keyboard and started learning about macros. I programmed my bank alt to just repeatedly on the mailbox in the city and every few minutes shout: "I hate mailbox."
---
Great times.
---
&gt; So how do I get the most out of being the healer?
---
Play the game of 'how low can they go without dying?'.
---
Leveling 1-12 takes about 3-4 hours. You could just group up from day 2 to 50.
---
It's a Legion patch 
---
He said dozens (plural) and then dozens again (also plural). 
---
That means there will be at least two pairs of dozens, for a minimum total of 48.
---
So, what you're saying is that you're going to be getting the original vanilla experience? (The game launched without RP-PvP servers.)
---
This is a truly #nochanges re-release.
---
Ever mind controlled someone off a cliff?
---
&gt; Nor am I going to play on a PvE server and just watch the other faction tag those mobs without contention. 
---
Too bad that, regardless of whether you play on a PvE, or a PvP server, 50% of the playerbase will be able to tag whichever mobs they want, without you being able to contest them.
---
Believe it or not, a lot of RPers interested in PvP spend a lot of their time flagged.
---
Yes bro! I'm someone who has never played WoW in his life, yet has always craved to. Now that Classic WoW is coming out, this is the perfect opportunity for me to dive into this world and community as I don't have the excuse of "everyone has a head start to me" or that I'm "10 years late to the party".   
---
The lore of a game is something that is seriously important to me and if I would definitely be reading your guide if you ever made one. And also, if anyone knows any other noob friendly lore resources, please let me know!
---
Could just do it at the dwarf quest npc no?
---
Personally, I always ran with just one main pet regardless of stable slots, and usually the first one I tamed early on then kept with me all the way. Y'all can keep your Broken Tooths and your Uhk'locs and your Naraxis...es. IMO, a hunter's pet is supposed to be the second half of a whole, so choose wisely when starting out and never turn your back on your first beastly boo.
---
At any rate, my plan is to have two, possibly three hunters (as well as at least one of every other class - why yes, I *am* a raging altoholic!), all Horde; one of whom will, immediately upon learning Tame Pet at level 10, suicide-run up Teldrassil to nab both an owl (because rarity) and a level 1 nightsaber from Shadowglen.
---
"But why not just tame a nightsaber in Darkshore?" you ask.
---
Because I'm a lore nerd, and an immersive role player, and probably more than a little bit mad. But mostly because I'm a total sap whose first character was a night elf hunter who *also* ran back to Shadowglen to tame a level 1 nightsaber immediately upon hitting level 10. A nightsaber who then stuck by her side through thick, thin and 30-some levels of huntard-ness until someone finally took pity on me at level 40ish and taught me how traps work and why I should train them.
---
He stuck with her after that too, of course, but once I'd learned how to not be a complete and total noob he could finally stop pretending he didn't know my character and prowling whenever anyone who mattered might have seen them together.
---
The way I figure it, since I'll already taking a walk down Nostalgia Lane with Classic, I may as well go all in on it.
---
I only hope, for my family's sake, some small vestige of my sanity manages to survive.
