Edgemaster's are considered best in slot untill naxxramas if I'm not mistaken.

---
Weapon skill is a very tricky thing, I highly advice that you google it.
---
It helps to know there are people experiencing the same or similar situations. I get that itch, I’ve had it a while, I don’t think it’ll ever really go away,   If you know you have an addictive personality I wouldn’t touch classic. I’m just happy I stopped now and not in a few months time.
---
&gt;Any mage that doesn't automatically pass out at least 3 stacks of water per mana bar in a group immediately upon entering the instance without being asked is awful at their class imo
---
I'm not going to go so far as to say that, but mages certainly should expect to be asked to do so.
---
It just gets so expensive to buy water constantly, especially when trying to save for things like a mount. Click a button a few times and you've saved me 2-3 gold, that's pretty significant.
---
Autohotkey is waaaaay better at this:
---
1. Download autohotkey
---
2. Google script for "always on top"
---
3. Copy and paste script into new autohotkey script
---
4. Run script
---
Then with a combination of ctrl+space (or any other hotkey you choose) you can make any window like a web browser run on top of your game or anything else for that matter.
---
I always have a YouTube or Hulu video playing on top of my game when I'm farming. Or a calculator while checking prices on the AH. Or just a wowhead guide to whatever you're doing at the time.
---
There are also some great scripts to disable your windows key, or disable the combination of alt+tab so it doesn't mess you up in game.
---
Looking for two kinds of questing resources, do these exist?
---
1. A list of all the 'This item starts a quest' items for each zone?
---
2. A list of 'grab all these quests from outside a zone before heading to that zone' quests?
---
Just fall over and play dead...

I'm a level 60 feral druid, and I've probably tanked around 80% of my dungeons up to this point. Honestly, last few days I've just gotten to the point where I'll no longer sign up to groups as anything other than pure DPS. Tanking is fucking exhausting, as the quality of groups you get varies so wildly. Sometimes you get really good groups which know how to manage their threat, ensuring a smooth and quick run, but most of the times it is usually "average" groups where you're just flat out fighting to keep up. Occasionally you will even get groups which are a complete and utter disaster with people all focusing different targets (even ignoring marks), and with myself having to run around with zero rage trying to pull mobs off of everybody. Those ones aren't fun, but they are still more frequent than smooth runs. Playing a tank feels like a PvP experience where you're fighting against your own team instead of corporating with them.
---
I'd rather spend 30 minutes AFK in Stormwind searching for a group as a DPS than decide to instantly join any one of hundreds of groups looking for a tank to go. The tank shortage exists because no one wants to play tanks, and no one wants to play tanks because tanking is very rarely an enjoyable experience.
---
**Paladin:** has to level with only auto attacks
---
**Warrior:** levels with 99% auto attacks and no self heals.
---
For someone preaching maturity you're not doing a very good job of demonstrating it. Have fun in your mother's basement for the rest of your single lonely little life.
---
i rp'd as a ticket taker on the zepplin to and from tirisfal glades today. charged 50s each way. made almost 10 gold inside of 2 hours. was a lot of fun. 10/10 would recommend you find your own hustle and leave mine alone ;)
---
I unsubbed last week for similar reasons. All the bad habits that took me over a decade to get rid off came back within a week of playing the game. I love it, too much for my own good apparently.
---
Hunters have such a huge amount of utility. I always get owned by them. Aspect of the Cheetah is OP.
---
fishing lvls?
---
Wow look at that, more steps already covered by everyone else!
---
I went there yesterday as a lvl 45 warr with ww axe equipped and a 60 rogue asked how many charms i needed and i said 60. He traded me 60 charms and i said thanks and kept farming looool
---
Codex???
---
/u/zuhaar
---
I was with a mage last night that was like this.   I opened trade for water and he sits looking at trade for 2minutes, i then whisper him and say "water please"... he puts in one stack and ends trade.   
---
Of course 20 min later i open another trade and he delays again and gives one more stack..... like wtf dude?   These mages acting like conjuring water cost reagents or some shit!
---
Yeah, seeing as most of my pre-raid BIS is leather or mail and about the only thing I'd be rolling against a tank for is the belt off Drakk...
---
Haha exactly like my bear pet
---
Double negative? One proofread by someone could have saved your comic.
---
Basically I get the regular action bar layout without the gryphons + I can't move or lose those actions bars..
---
I do already lol. And yes they do. There's a reason why the necklace from Scholo with 20 shadow damage ranks higher than the 1% hit necklace from Strath. It's more damage overall.
---
Yes, 10 days logged out in an inn or capital city gives you the rested exp cap.
---
Says who?
---
Have always played warlock, wanted something a bit more challenging. 
---
Warrior sees to be it. I am way low-level, as in just tanked RFC for the first time. It was... not pretty. Didn't wipe or anything, but I probably only got 60 to 70% of total damage received. 
---
Biggest struggle was pulls of three or more. I'd do demoralizing shout, wait an agonizingly long time to get enough rage to sunder, and do what i could. One pull would always run to DPS&lt; and I'd run to taunt. Good guides on managing multiples? Might just go back to lock-  sitting in the back and lazily dotting everything.
---
I can't stand it, you have no awareness of what's around you like that as shown in this video, if you were zoomed out you'd see someone as they came into the 30y or so range of you, giving you much more time to react to ganks and whatnot. If you prefer it though there's no reason to say otherwise, you need to enjoy how you play too!
---
That's very helpful thanks I'll go play WoW in a cinema
---
MOAR DOTS is basically playing on a loop in my head 24/7
---
On a tank no less
---
It's nice to think that, but the way the game actually works is you can roll need on something if you want to if you're using that loot method.  If you want to enforce what you've typed out, then you use master looter and use player enforcement rather than the game's rule.
---
Suppose I'll have to try it tomorrow!
---
Well, I am not concerned whether it is BiS or not. :)
---
I forgot I couldn’t inspect opposite faction. Click... death.
---
Well... the filter was set up based on English and I can't think of any commonly word that would contain "niger" in it. Other languages just got hit with splash damage.
---
I was at work and couldn't get one. I really wanted that statue!
---
Its 1,5 or 2 levels maximum. But it takes like 10 days to get that amount, so dont worry about it.
---
roommates
---
I'm at my brother and his fiancee's baby shower kinda bummed out cuz I really wanted to work on my blacksmithing today oh well family and all that good shit.
---
Some people don't need them as much. I have friends who still need their LBRS gems, but they always group with me who has the UBRS Seal so they'd be more than happy to join a group of LBRS that has gems reserved. It doesn't really matter to them.
---
&gt;#NOCHANGE
---
Fuck applying no changes to Classic. There are many things that *do* need changing. This is one of them.
---
ok
---
As somebody who mains a mage but who also after years and years of tanking and healing takes my job seriously, I wish I could flag myself as not one of them.  #notallmages
---
Worth a shot though.
---
Thank you. =)
---
Retail mentality 101 on display.
---
You're correct that it's a hair too slow to be a great arms weapon, but I think it's a nice Pally weapon. Plus, having an epic to look forward to will make the grind along the way feel faster than it might've otherwise!
---
I found a mage guys
---
So BoE epics in a raid environment should be up for grabs? GTFO With that BS .
---
I’m in red ridge and have the same problem with a different quest.
---
Reset didn’t work nor did re installing aap
---
Dogs mainly
---
It’s ridiculous. Life tap is to prolong your resources when u run out in a single fight, or solo with life drain, not to steal money from the healer and thinking we’re mates.
---
Haha I need to watch that again it's been years
---
Here I am at lvl 42 with 18 gold.
---
You will need the rep to get mounts.
---
This is remarkably accurate and reminds me why Classic is such a masochistic delight.
---
Honestly at lvl 60 it's great, you come online and just do whatever dungeon you like, but on weekends you need a DND tag.
---
It’s funny how quickly you feel yourself slip back into that role, doesn’t matter how long it’s been.
---
It's a few extra twitch prime members. Part of the reason is he needs to keep the content fresh. Going on a new server as a level 1 and everyone else being able to log on and do the same thing is a cool experience for some people.
---
Doesnt do anything for a Hunter. Go for a pally or warrior
---
Sounds like you are speaking from experience.
---
Orbs reserved.
---
Did you end up resubbing?
---
Egh, rolling for DPS stuff as a tank is pretty scummy though. I don't think your Hunters/Rogues/Warriors are gonna appreciate the tank stealing their Mask of the Unforgiven.

Players who do this all the time basically control the market on a pretty widely used set of armor. Since they control the market they don’t undercut each other no matter what the supply is.

yeah many people saw same opportunity before and posted it. but it still puts smile on my face.

Humans do this but much smaller, just do some bending and spreading near a mirror next time you feel a fart

Mind vision have range and requires LoS in Classic.
---
Imagine bitching about people bitching.
---
More like moaning and crying into a camera to make us all miserable for clicking it
---
I think it's worth it for the experience of partys in dungeons. If your interested in lore check out the books in scarlet monastery library wing.
---
Personally I go fury until 30 then respec arms, there's really not much in arms before then to make it worth it (plus no need for tac mastery until you get zerker stance)
---
people are dumb
---
If you see quest missing go to classic Wowhead and search the number, it'll bring up the quest and you can go get it. Other than that /aap skip and /aap reset are your friends. Skipping enough times will eventually get to something workable.
---
Alright, im a mage. I hand out free food and water to anyone and everyone who asks for it and ill port you at the cost of the reagent. I cant stand mages that act like a temper tantrum two year old when people ask because it makes the rest of us look bad. All I ask from the rest of you guys is dont judge the mage, until he actually does something worth judging, because there are still a lot of us out there that know whats up :)

Bad Mojo Mask on a mage?

Jesus they should do studies on people who pick mage.

While it doesnt work like a priest MC it is indeed bugged with the pet bar atm. There is an addon that let's you see the pet bar that someone made.
---
Your choice, good for you.
---
You need more self control if youd like to play and not fall into the abyss again. 
---
Good luck.
---
I just put the person on ignore and never see them whisper me ever again to join my group. ez
---
Boo fucking hoo!
---
Think you misspelt hunters
---
Best for who? It doesn't increase the amount of items guild gets from raid (unless you are unable to clear whole raid because gear is not distributed optimally which isn't a case in MC or ONY) so it's not better in that sense. Sure loot council is awesome if you are highly respected player in your guild or good friend with officers, if not some kind of DKP variation would be better for you.
---
For #1, you can [check wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=6;1;0), click the header of the "source" column to  sort em all by what zone they drop in.
---
sry, this is probally answered somewhere but i couldnt find it, english is not my native language
---
is their something that works like simcraft and raidbots for classic? Like you see if an item is an dps increase
---
Stream man bad. Giv karma pls.
---
&gt; Please don't come here bitching about world pvp
---
He's not bitching about world pvp you mongoloid.
---
Do classic go into the retail? So i could take my 60 in Classic and play him in retail?
---
Making the stream more entertaining, sure. But to say he's only doing it because it will make him X dollars is stupid.
---
raids SIGNIFICANTLY lower xp and you cant complete quests, just fyi
---
Have you ever gotten anywhere by ignoring a situation? Asmon will be so tilted if one of us ride the scarab mount. He is especially known for mounts.
---
What addon is that??
---
Then I encourage you to educate yourself and stop being hateful about things which have zero impact on your life. I'm sure you won't, though.
---
Waste your energy hating whatever you want, but you sound like a caveman afraid of thunder.

You can log off in any inn to get rested xp
---
Oh man that sounds bannable.

Well this looks useful and time consuming

You could use this

The problem is also that it leada me to the place where i had to kill murdkeep, a boss which i did and complete the quest. Even after the missing quest error i killed killed him it did nothing

My last words would be ‘You look like a pug’

The person is trolling you, nothing crosses from classic to retail
---
REDDIT MAD
---
I just tried this thinking about all that time I would save, feeling proper speed run like. I cast the hearth, while it's being cash to go back to SW I talk with Inn master in Astranar to set the destination so I can return and quest later. Hearth is finally done casting and I move.. no where... Queue swearing at fucking reddit and walking 15min to the boat to Menethil, wait for boat and fly to SW. Gonna rate this TIL a zero and never truet reddit again
---
Bro I have stage 3 adhd can I get devilsaur legs/gloves please?
---
Using the default UI, I have my DPS abilities on my primary action bar, and my resto abilities on my secondary action bar.  When I swap roles, I just shift+scroll between the bars.
---
There's a little overlap, as I still want access to a few heals when out soloing or DPSing.  But whatever keybinds you set to your main action bar (default 1 through =) function the same for the secondary bar when you shift+scroll between them.  So my DPS bar has lightning bolt on 1, and my resto bar has lesser healing wave on 1.
---
If you have health insurance that supports it, try visiting a therapist.  It may not be or you but many types of therapy are cheap and you have something that is genuinely causing distress where you may benefit from an objective, neutral voice to sort out.
---
More important the later the game goes. Eventually some good rewards / crafting materials, etc.  and it’s needed if you want to do Naxx at any point.
---
I feel like the only two posts I've seen in the past day about smackdown or ownage by you have been during recklessness. Not trying to say you're bad or anything, but this is just as cringey as the PVP videos that only showed crit hits on kills back in 2004-2005 era.

Yessir, even his armor is a reference, fire resist and arcane resist in reference to the teams he played on.

Reputation doesn’t matter for guilds that only play within the guild. As every mafia guild has done since its invention on Nostalrius.
---
I was in, in the first second, it looked like the place was empty at first, then 100s of people started flooding out from 1 spot and covering the entire area
---
To think that god wants you to be hash tagging people this.. lmao sad time we leave in.
---
That attitude is on herod too, everyone does cleave
---
He saw cdew practically global multiple people with hand of sulfuras as an ele shaman and decided to reroll from warrior. I assume it's all as a joke tbh
---
Pretty much this. Me and my wife are in out 30s and chose to level in Desolace because there's barely any hordies there to gank us, because all of the 30-40 horde levelers are in STV because they know it's safe for them there because of all the lvl 60 horde ganking parties constantly roaming around there.
---
Looks like KiwiPlates which I use and is rad
---
No but they will probably throw a max level boost or two at you to get u to play
---
Totally understandable, sounds like it was the right move for you. Good luck!
---
The best part is no one waits for you to drink again after you buff.
---
they added all the other functionalities of the vanilla API with regards to targeting except focus.
---
to sum it up
---
Yeah it won't recognise you've done it if you've already done it. Just type /aap skip until it goes to the next step.
---
Is he doing something bad for people who don’t watch his content and just play the game on his server? I’m not implying he doesn’t even I ask this I’m just curious.
---
Exactly... we don’t even know when P2 is coming out
---
Did that person have 40k viewers advertising Warcraft to them?
---
Fair points. I’d still be upset if it didn’t go to a priest / mage though.
---
It’s not bannable, it’s not against the TOS and if you take your time to look up the old TOS, it’s not mentioned there either.
---
I’ve read both, they were posted on this subreddit some time ago. I’ve made tickets with GMs saying that finding way to communicate with the other faction IN GAME (aka GoToREtail macros) is bannable, working together to achiev a goal is not.
---
If you like WC3, then yes, its the living WC world you get to experience, less of the bullshit of the xpacs devolving story.

No major enormous event, just a man on the ground, able to see and experience the world.
---
Send your pet at them and kite them, use concussive shots, freeze traps, scatter shots, wingclips
---
Most definitely! Instead of returning to a capital city every time your bags get full, you just mail it to your bank alt via the mailbox in the zone you’re in when you go back to vendor items. That way your main can stay out in the world longer and not be bogged down doing auction-related things.
---
Don’t be ungrateful, he’s fed us some good food
---
The next step is wierd cuz it Just tells,, quest missing return to oru'' and if i do that Will it work again with later on quest or is it Just screwd to the  rest of the game
---
I know and relate how addicting wow can be. But the good news is that you can stop  playing by stopping subscription. That has helped me deal with too much gaming. Good luck with life.
---
I am tempted to reroll AWAY from my warrior, because I don't want to tank but that's what people always want me to do.
---
But really the group finding experience doesn't seem that much different to 15 years ago, tanks have always been the hardest to find
---
I got savage chain twice in 5 runs, we disenchanted it. Still no HoJ though.
---
Nah it's really easy to grind, just so strat and scholo. Keep the stones until revered then turn them all win and u will be exalted

If it says quest missing it should say a number next to it, search that number on classic Wowhead and it'll show you which quest and where, go pick it up, then continue following it.

That's a subcategory of what looks like abusing communication for harassment, which doesn't mean "All communication is against TOS", it would mean any communcation to harass them is against TOS. One thing is not the other, sharing a subrule to a rule and not sharing the actual rule doesn't help this statement. This is also a TOS from 7 years ago either way, which means absolutely nothing now.
---
depends on what level the mage is at, if they just unlocked the new water that level or 1 level ago you really shouldn't expect them to make everyone 3 stacks of water (or youre just going to be using the worse water and most people bitch about handing that out as well)
---
just for reference, making 3 stacks for just 2 people takes around 9 minutes when you're using the newest rank at 2 bottles per cast (not including the bottles you drink yourself to keep going)
---
Yeah it is a shitshow in the dungeons as a tank, no one pays attention to the aggro and the fights are pretty intense for me, but I stopped giving a fuck, if they want it that way let it be. I got tired of explaining how to do pulls and it seems I was just annoying people...
---
Heyyy DD is the best server. I know it’s more weighted towards Alliance but not by a huge margin.

Thanks for the share. I have always been curious how parents can let their kids do that. How did you parents handle your addiction as a teenager? We’re they indifferent, or did they try to support you.? If you one day become a father, how would you handle the situation as the parent?

You could skip the sword from the SM chain and just wait a few levels for the RFD chain if you want to get the 2h axe. There are several options in that range, but so many people take the WW axe just because everyone says they must.

No he said faerlina and olympus is still his main thing and it seemed like it was just trolling for the day. It was his friend that wanted to roll a enh shaman on herod really bad and take it serious since he realized nothing will make ret good thats coming to classic. I think he rolled ret in anticipation for TBC but he didnt realize just how bad ret is on classic and how long classic will be (or if we get TBC at all even).

That's the way fishing is no matter where you fish. I did 250-300 in the highest fishing areas with +25 pole and +100 lures just to fish there and it still took like 12-15 between each level.

Would you mind sharing your build or how you spent your initial points? I've been leveling as combat, but I'm only 18 and really missing the backstab / ambush stuff.
---
I’ve heard you have to convert it into a raid for this to work properly? 
---
I tried multiple times with a friend and it would be a hit or miss, most of the Time it would give me a 60 second timer after my friend leaves he party once it reset me to the beginning. A few other times i would log back in and be at my HS. 
---
Do I have to wait a certain amount of time in login screen?

Need before greed IMHO. That mage better equip it though if they win film need.
---
Its free tho.....

Like im a druid what am i going to start charging for heals?

The more you help the group the more successful the group will be

You dont owe water to a random passer by

You DO OWE your kit to the group all of it that includes 3 secs of summoning water...

As someone who builds parties constantly if i were to get a whiff of this you are out full stop
---
Lol we should always help one another i always go out of my way to buff and heal everyone i see in my line of sight party or no party

Well, All-Knowing Lord of Tanks, mayhaps you would deign to offer some constructive criticism instead of being a sewer muppet and spewing shit for no reason other than to feel superior to randos on the internet.

I guess I'm used to the rate at which it levels up from 1 to 150... That seemed slot quicker.

A right to speak, maybe. Not a right to be heard.
---
Dammit u beat me to it.
---
It is def. a big deal but if you can find a guild that raids the day before and after reset, it's only 50g a week, which is about 1 hour of gold farming, and since you are rogue you can farm gold in un'goro with devilsaurs, you don't need to be in a mafia or anything just stealing skins from opposite faction and outtagging people. Really fun way and can be very profitable depending on the server.

You left out the rest of the horde players that outnumber the Topi almost 2 to 1.

My best buddy plays a mage and he loves dungeons. He's almost always the first one to the instance. His rule is that everyone gets 100 water. Even the warrior.

I do wish Drain Life worked on friendly targets because after all, what are friends for?

Dictating how other groups should play is for losers

I would like to get gator bite axe, but I'm a solo player who's new to wow, so I don't know dungeons and how to maximize my dps, so I've never done a dungeon in fear of embarrassment.

On runescape, I know there were a few clans that taught/ran noobs through dungeons.

Are there those types of guilds on wow?

The problem is that the average scrub is not aware of this and doesn't know how to skirt the radius effectively, so they end up pulling aggro and dying instantly because they were too close.
---
but we'll never know for sure! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Until then, learning beforehand is my recommendation.
---
I was disappointed when I finally was able to craft and use these and they had like a four second cast timer. This was in 4.0

440 vs 40 that's something else but for warsong Gulch and a b it was very long throw time

Gave away at least a dozen stacks of 8 for this exact reason.  Also sucks to compete with Druid moonfire insta cast dmg pull. It’s fun to destroy people trying to compete for spawns, but eventually it’s just sad and jerky. I’m not good at the game, but moonfire is just really fast with great range.

Asmongold is a literal mongoloid and a piece of shit. His content is incredibly fake, and forced, if not scripted. Why he has such a large following is beyond me.
---
Just ignore the dude. His content is fake, and so is his relationship with pinksparkles. I can't wait tonsee this guys career diminish.
---
P.S. I don't play on herod. I just fucking hate asmongold.
---
The stock interface layout without art?
---
To be clear by "stock layout" I mean the action bar and bags etc are close to where they would be anyway.
---
Whoever that weird guy who is always in the Discord call with Asmond was quite serious about playing on Herod.  I've seen him "act" and play up situations before and quite frankly he's bad at it.  His friend was being serious about playing Herod.  Even if Asmond doesn't actively play it, hundreds if not thousands will flock to it just to be in "Asmond's guild".
---
And not draw attention to the fact hat our sub is being hijacked by paid content?
---
I find people, their experiences, and their motivations behind decisions to be very interesting.  Thanks for the read and insight into your life and mind.  
---
You likely made a good decision, and hopefully will learn to take things in moderation in the future.
---
I swear 3/4 of all the asshole players I've run into in classic are mages. It's gotten so bad I've started to become wary of joining groups if they have a mage.
---
Yea no you could just as easily post a linen cloth for 1000g
---
My Parents are both wonderful people and it has taken me a while to apreciate them In that way.
---
  I’m their first born, so going through the years as it usually happens the mistakes are made and if you learn, not made again with another child. 
---
This was 2006, early early days of mmo’s and I really don’t think many parents knew how addictive these games could be and how they affect their children. Baring in mind this is before social media really became main stream, so the general knowledge of gaming addiction just wasn’t there. 
---
Up till that point I had played a lot of games, healthily. From pokemon to mario games on the GameCube so another game wasn’t really a part of their concerns. 
---
When I was lashing out emotionally because of the game I think they thought it was a teenage thing more than a gaming thing. They did the usual ban me from playing for weeks at a time. The one thing I do remember is I had an absolutely ruthless resolve when it came to punishment, I saw it as a challenge to stay angry, get through it and then continue on with my gaming. I think I was just too much to handle with it.
---
I can’t remember much and that really is the scary thing, I was so tunnel visioned about being in that world I would have torn down the house to be in it. 
---
I think it’s one of those things when you’ve been through an experience that you can truly understand it, if I do have kids by god their online activity will be tracked because the freedom to lose yourself online just snowballs to the point where you can’t control that feeling, it’s like you become immune to dopamine and you need longer exposures to get similar satisfaction.
---
This is rich coming from people claim omg Asmongold is the "cancerous" one lol
---
Eh, you reap what you sow.  I'm the friendliest, most courteous group member you'll ever have.  You tag my mob when it's obviously mine and I'll follow you for an hour dropping psychic scream on all your aoe packs.
---
Would you mind waiting around for a bit?  I have a friend who specializes in expensive banana breads that would know more about this before I make an offer.
---
You literally get paid to do runs as a tank. The hey “I’m here for XX as well” will still get you invited.
---
Will no one think of the children?
---
A bit much to dream about this for more than a decade.

Your fault for picking a full server, transfer to a low pop server if you don't want any queues or stop crying.

Good to know, i rerolled Hunter, so appreciate the heads up.
---
It's not in tos anymore. Go on. Find it.
---
Hahaha, I think you're right. He's now naked again running around Org targetting high level players. He's been here for quite a while, since he has Warchief's blessing that went out one and a half hours ago.
---
Honestly just improved healthstone
---
Your damage helps the group, and your summons 
---
Be the first one there and summon the group, then hand out healthstones, and don’t life tap yourself to death so your healer can save their mana
---
see which pet fits best in which dungeon, need cc? Succ, need health buff and thorns? Imp. Need and offtank? Void. Felhunter not so much

Go affliction for leveling though, best dmg and sustain

It's not the cooldown itself. It's when you only post footage that involves around using a 30min or a big cooldown as clips to show off "PVP". He also posted one yesterday where he did the exactly same thing. Popped recklessness, killed two people, and then posted it like it was "amazing pvp!".  
---
It's no different than the old videos where people would just use clips of them getting crit kills or during long cooldown windows and put those as the only part. The good ol crit montage videos.
---
Either. You’ll just be suboptimal. If you prefer PvP run a PvP build and you could still land a raid spot if you’re in a guild
---
Ran into a lock last night who couldn't give me soulstone (as healer/rezzer) because he ran out of soulshards. What kind of warlock runs out of soul shards halfway through a dungeon??

They should just que the overpopulated faction and things would work out just fine.

People love hating streams as much as other people love loving them

Aren't they pretty big usually? They will just group with themselves

Badlands. Earth elementals. Made my 35g deficit dissappear in about half a level of AOE farming them. Nice dense little loop in the southern mountain ridge that you can go round and round and by the time your done they are respawning at the start of the loop again.

Are you being serious? 
---
He gets 'mentioned' because of dumb ass threads like this. You literally just made a 'hey have you heard of Asmongold?" post you moron
---
I’m curious, do you mouse click every ability?
---
At a basic level at minimum I would keybind abilities to the following keys.
---
1 to 5, R, F, V, C, X, Z
---
I’d also rebind your stafe keys on Q &amp; E to A &amp; D respectively. This opens up Q &amp; E to use on abilities. 
---
If you need more keybindings you can press Shift + any of the above for different combinations of abilities. 
---
Most of the keys I’ve mention have actions bound to them so you will need to rebind them in you wish to use them. 
---
As for macros they can be a little more complex and they very depending on your class. I’d recommend looking up useful class macros and copy some from there. 
---
Some actions you will need a macro otherwise if just makes the process annoying. 
---
For example on my warrior I have a macro that casts battle stance before charging. This is helpful because if I’m in a different stance it will automatically put me in the correct stance to use charge.
---
Did you read what I said? He never sold the item. want me to find the videos? I have them ready from the last time.
---
He sold BiS freezing band ring for his class instead that someone gave him for his epic mount. All you motherfuckers just dont want to hear the truth.

Loot council is a noob trap for a lot of guilds. It's absolutely the best system in a solid guild, but it's being abused a lot in less serious guilds as a way to gear the core while not giving a fuck about everyone else.
---
&gt; Herod is already teetering on a Horde majority
---
Teetering?  Don't we (Horde) outnumber them 2 to 1?
---
I also went druid warrior and forgot druids can't rez in classic, which really hampers their ability to heal a dungeon...
---
Skeksis shall always live! Skeksis shall always rule!
---
Int + Stam if your using Imp (which is the best grinding build)
---
Same, soon as I get invited to the group I burn my mana bar making water then as I'm traveling to the instance I burn my mana bar until I have 3 stacks per mana user in the group.  I want motherfuckers chugging in between pulls at 80% so we don't have to sit around waiting for someone to full mana bar a vendor drink.  Have some more, bitches!  Drink, drink, drink!!!

I do have target of target, but it's from ElvUI (because I dislike the Roth target of target).
---
You can go into the config file in the Roth UI addon folder to modify length of bars or spawn 3d portraits.
---
Though it might have been something like that. Thanks for spelling it out for me though! It will probably save me a headache later
---
It was an auto-generated name too so...spooky.
---
Hoo fuck my boo!
---
That's why the first thing i do on my mage when i log on is make a bunch of waters. Do it while looking for a group, AH, checking mail, etc and it's not so bad
---
I agree but they hot fixed tyr's hand for a similar reason back in vanilla.
---
Always carry thistle tea. Pop it after you cheap shot, and sinister once, then use the tea. This will allow you to sinister one more time then kidney shot. You shouldn’t get feared if you do it quick enough even if they have coil up. 
---
Always, always carry thistle tea.
---
Woah this is exactly the addon. I’ve been looking for! Thank you!
---
I shared a link to my addons here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dd3va5/finally_hit_level_40_and_saved_up_enough_money/f2f823s/
---
Type /roth ingame for customisation settings (/roth unlockart allows you to move the orbs). You can also go into the config file in the Roth addon folder to customise Roth further.
---
I don't know how any serious streamer could not be 60 by now. I'm a horrible casual with a full time job and I'm 57. I don't know what dungeon layering even is or the first thing about how it works.
---
Just grind ST till 53 then grind BRD till 58 then any  of the end game dungeons. You can get a level a day super easy.
---
Yes and no. If you're purposely disrupting the play of others, you can't. If he rolled Herod and just started playing sure. If you roll on the server, bringing with you 100s of your friends and then spamming trade chat so people who are playing can't use it, that's not cool.
---
This drama is pure (Asmon)gold KEKW
---
let me rephrase.
---
dwarfs track treasure like hunters track npcs.
---
or a miner ore, or a herbalist plants.
---
Clearly it wasn't advertised, so they are wasting others' time. You put your reserving rules in the advertisement so people who aren't into that can ignore your party.
---
Malware
---
Its does in the context of what was and wasnt allowed at the time of vanilla wow. Where does it show this is context of harassment? Just because it's a separate tos reason mentioned there?
---
That's when I would let them die, rez them and ask "what did we learn?" If they didnt learn they can die again until they figure it out. Most do or they leave.
---
Using this mod, can you actually tell of ppl leave a negative comment about you? I try to be nice but you are never sure you know?
---
I mean you still shit on Warriors and Rogues, but without improved counterspell your gonna have a hard time against Warlock and Priest.
---
As for if you should, it’s up to you man. If you know the AOE spots and your server isn’t Full then AOE grinding is definitely better Gold/Hour and XP/Hour - but if you don’t know what your doing, or spend too much time competing for tags, or spend a lot of time dead then it becomes far far less efficient.
---
The entire point of this post is Asmon is now playing Horde on Herod. So no, he’s not on the “dedicated streamer realm”.
---
Ahhh, a man of culture
---
How? You cant solo that guy with all those drunks around him can you?
---
The entire point of reserving items is to create that scenario...

It seems mages still haven't learned their place.
---
Must be the high from all that AoE farming.
---
(I say this as a mage main)
---
You can play both on the same server
---
They should just not do cross server bgs.  If everyone wants to roll horde on a server, then they sit in queue forever.   
---
I'm close to 60 on my server... thinking of rerolling horde to a smaller server.  It is awful trying to do anything when you're out numbered 4 to 1 every second.
---
AT WORK?!?!?
---
Wtf you dont wash your clothes?
---
You said you skipped out in wing clip and the traps. Those are the main tools imo that make hunters so difficult to deal with in pvp.
---
Lil B still has a pretty big presence on twitter
---
That's what ignore is for, haha
---
That's the difference between an assassin and a swashbuckling duelist for ya.
---
Asmongolds fault
---
A popular streamer who will not be named rolled an alt there to troll the server and his crew of people followed him.
---
Hahaha he’s only pretending to be an annoying asshat! Such a clever ruse!
---
SQL database is easier than writing 'MySQL relational database management system accessed using SQL', to anyone relevant like you they'll understand. I also remember there being two different RDBMS used depending, but MySQL being the main one.
---
Not in Vanilla
---
Lasher farming was never "hotfixed" or "nerfed" in vanilla, ergo no reason to "nerf" it now.
---
Yes, i know. Thanks.
---
Its lowering the targets stats. Its not for your party, its universal.
---
LMAO look at the Cntrl F + Shift F keybinds. He activates Disenchant then clicks the keybind to get mana back from Archmage and DE’s it.
---
Brutal!!!!
---
Unless they changed it, you can't on PvP realms. One faction only.
---
Is that what we're calling the streamers and their horde (hurhur) of fans who clog servers? "The Cancer"?
---
Also as an outside who plays on a non-streaming server this is gonna be really funny
---
Rogue/fury warr weapon.
---
Look at the keybinds on the right side. You’ll see it happen.
---
I have not played warlock but a mages ability to get out of literally any scenario is why I chose one. Also the fact I can teleport and portal anyone across the map
---
Dont spread bullshit. A whole guild on my server and some of my friends and guild mates also got banned.
---
Destruction is the best for dungeons as your damage is more direct.  You are typically using your imp and most just an emo mage.
---
Affliction is more focused on dots, which drops their efficiency when mobs die fast or risk more aggro due to dots on everything.  They do have the best curses and using curse of weakness and recklessness wisely can be a huge boon to a group. 
---
Demonology is very pet focused.  And unless they have the sacrifice talent and have sacced their pet, you have a psuedo hunter without the growl.
---
Destruction is very direct and while it has dots,  it's more single targeted and doesn't try to do too much other than sling shadowbolts at things.
---
True, but i really miss the charge and overall destruction of warrior face-smashing attacks.
---
Where I can download this one for Classic? I only find on twitch the retail version.
---
You have a right to free speech, but not a right to be heard. Grow up manchild
---
I suspect a strong tinfoil hat
---
Nope. Most people seem to know what level range is appropriate for a dungeon in my experience so far. Personally I  try and wait until I'm on the high range of levels before bothering because I want my runs to go quick and smoothly
---
Don't forget only showing clips where they are fully buffed and have the enrage/bloodlust from Warsong Gulch or something..
---
I’m on rattlegore also and it is indeed very healthy. Always a good ratio and last I remember when they ran the census it was fairly even
---
You say "Shield Slam was 1.6" and then you post the patch notes showing the redesign was in patch 1.10? But there's more, the patch note you have posted is actually from the Naxx patch 1.11, so you've doctored the patch notes in the hope I wouldn't notice?  What's more I was talking about Prot on the whole in my previous posts in what was a passing tidbit in the discussion about 2h/DW, why are you obsessing specifically over Shield Slam?
---
You've completely missed the point of and direction of every post, misinterpreted what I said, ignored inconvenient things I've said while filling in the blanks for the rest with your imagination, to finish it off you falsified the patch note information. All to try to make your completely fucking pointless argument easier. 
---
I'm done with this discussion, I come on Reddit to talk to passionate people about things I enjoy, not to do battle with dishonest lunatics who can't help themselves. Honestly you need to take a break from Reddit or get help.
---
I use mouse wheel up for pet attack and mouse wheel down for follow, it works really nicely especially for killing totems in ZF

---
I've been thinking about somebody I had a lot of fun playing with 15 years ago too. I'm glad you were able to reconnect! Here's my shot...
---
Miranda from Alleria I miss you!
---
Leatrix maps and atlas loot
---
I don’t get why this would be complex. You can shift click it so everyone can see the same damn thing.
---
My pally healer rolled on the HoJ that dropped.
---
Same. I run my own construction business and work 60+ hours a week and hit 60 in 3 weeks with no prior wow experience.
---
Just change the ingame resolution and slide the ui scale slider up
---
Imo warrior evolves the most. Starts out stupidly simple, but you get abilities over time, and stances lvl 10 and 30, and lv40 is a huge game changer with an entire new ability as either of the specs. This is massive.
---
Druid is also up there. Start by being a hard caster, then a bear, then a kitty, but after that it doesn't change much.
---
Felhunter is great to lock down caster mobs, interrupt can save a lot of damage
---
Great post, great content! Reddit has truly gone uphill!
---
We have the same mouse and keyboard. I think were supposed to kiss now.
---
as a mage, I can confirm, basically all my bad interactions with my own faction have been with other mages :(( 
---
sorry guys, trade me for some food/water though :(
---
You want the Rain of Fire stun - it’s amazing for AOE pulls and Oh-Shit moments
---
So many whining crybabies on here. I would love it if he would come to my server! It’s people like you that caused blizzard to cut short the undead plague event and never do anything interesting again! “ oh I can’t use the ah!” “I need to go to the bank!” “Nothing can disrupt my cookie cutter experience!”
---
Yeah that’s fair. I’ve mostly just been grinding past level 24, so I don’t have that many quests up to begin with
---
Thank you, is that bad? ive been asking in server and people are being really toxic about it.
---
It means you can’t communicate with the other faction in game. Third party software to communicate with the other faction has never been anything Blizzard has regulated. This has been talked about over and over, nobody has ever gotten banned from it. There are probably hundreds of pictures of gm tickets floating around confirming it.
---
You could talk to the other faction via the Blizzard forums if you so wanted.
---
AV
---
Now you don't even have to alt tab while using the Internet for what it is for
---
oh, Thank you. I didn't know a streamer joined
---
Start cookin
---
At a certain level, the spell bonus splits into bonus damage/healing and straight healing.  The straight healing is much higher and will be your focus at max level.
---
Before then and really before you start getting spell power on gear, priests, elemental shamans, and balance/resto druids don't have a separate damage vs healing set of gear.
---
Dunno about the pets yet as for weaving, dont weave on Luci, Magmadar, Garr, Geddon, Shazz, Rag to avoid debuffs and such. Ghennas is also iffy because he moves around a lot.
---
Yes
---
Only ten more runs and you'll get Ravager too
---
I wasn't trying to kill him, I didn't care. I just wanted my escort protected by then. You can see it in my face that I really wasn't paying attention nor did I care at that point.
---
I can only choose between Windowed (Fullscreen) and Windowed.
---
Windowed Fullscreen is fixed to a resolution and windowed is a window.
---
Where do you get your data from?
---
Which add on lets you see your health and the enemies health  in actual numbers?
---
I imagine you’re gonna make memes with it?
---
Max level mom
---
I use an excel sheet called "Vanilla Shit List". Name/class/guild/reason.
---
In other words you don't actually know the answer yourself, you're just hoping that if you act like a self-fellating asshole long enough someone will tell you it.
---
its so ridiculous. he was handed hundreds of gold within minutes. whats wrong with these ppl.
---
You are just being dumb
---
You mean retaliation? I'm not just going to use that there. It's a short walk back. I also didn't care at this point; I just wanted to protect the escort quest.
---
Not in classic.
---
As a leveling enchanter when and where should I start looking/grinding for formulas?
---
Realmobhealth I believe it is
---
RUNNING 2 servers bruh
---
You cant have anything in mail, auction house at all.  Everything in bags and bank go with you
---
Hmmm, well you might be able to resize the ui that big with the scale slider anyways. Otherwise you'll have to change the resolution of your desktop before you launch wow
---
The comic sans looking font is ridiculous but fortunately easy to change.
---
Force of will drops off Thaurassian right now. hoJ drops off angerforge. I think in the future that switches.
---
Not saying I wouldn't trade you water but I hate when people just open trade with me without saying anything first. Comes off rude as hell.
---
Snoballs from the Xmas events used to be hoarded for the same reason - except of course they are one use only the err recipient can’t throw them back. Pretty sure they did a knockdown animation as well
---
The last census before blizz put a stop to that had us listed around 35k Alli 40k Horde

it gives 2.8% hit and glancing blow dmg.  I dont see how its BiS lol
---
Just gotta find a way to sneak a hybrid in that can Rez :p
---
Every mage deserves their aoe pulls ruined, everytime I see a mage get ganked I cheer
---
Damn spoilers. Loved the edit lol
---
I disagree. The slapping of WoW logos or other bare minimum of "related to wow" onto a years old meme template is so fucking lazy and not at all interesting. Look at /u/Rispetto 's post above of his specific examples of his quality meme posts being removed. Guess what? It's worn out, old, templates that we've all seen a thousand times with a pinch of WoW added to make it barely relevant. It's predictable, lazy and not particularly funny.
---
Yeah but at that point, if they're pulling aggro, they fucked up either way.
---
They’ve always been. It just they got a pass because they buff and give water.
---
Once they stopped they got the flakk.
---
Hunters replace that chest in MC. Dps warriors don't replace it until AQ40.
---
So I should always use sinister strike after a white swing, and never during/before?
---
Again, just shows how bad the classic community is.
---
I don't get why those people are even playing Classic if they want everything handed to them. Why not just keep playing retail?
---
I find these Reddit stories of mages being “the new huntard” to be pretty hilarious, but I’m level 45 and have only found one mage that acted like this. He completely ignored any requests for water, and when I asked why he didn’t give anybody arc int, he said “this is an easy dungeon, there’s no reason to be try hard”
---
Alliance Scum
---
You are playing with dudes feelings, his heart, this is really bad bad. Immoral as hell. You friend needs to tell him, it's really easy to say just takes tiny amount of balls to admit it that's it.

You will only cause pain this way if he really missed that friend, as essentially to keep the secret you have to leave him behind without explaining it in which case he just got rejected and will leave lingering pain and questions in him.
---
You friend is really lowly with this act.
---
Bad for some people. Like anyone looking to enjoy the game

It’s obviously clever,  he’s made himself a millionaire off a fake persona. Don’t hate.
---
Really happy for you
---
You're an asshole.
---
Routes. There was a post on this sub on how to get it to work in classic, need to change some text in the lua files.
---
Uh oh, the babies are out.
---
Oh baby keepin my eyes peeled for that one ☝️
---
Love having character notes.  I picked it up when I had my first bad dungeon run and now I avoid that party leader all the time.
---
Sounds made up.  I doubt that free transfers were a big deal in the grand scheme of things...  a lot of people stopped playing.  Alliance being dominated sounds like a raw deal for them and more likely a lot of them ended up quitting.  There have been numerous threads by people that transferred to the new servers and repeatedly we see that those servers are dead with like 20 to 30 60s on at a time
---
I see that, Thank you for your time.  :)
---
You just added to the problem, if you really wanna fix it delete this post and pretend he doesn’t exist
---
One could argue the normal game is a waste of time too. All that matters is it’s entertaining and you enjoy doing it. Besides, there a lots of games now based around perma-death. Binding of Isaac, Faster than light, Dayz, Scum, etc... I think it’d be cool to have just ONE server with PD in WOW.
---
Go AoE spec, then grind SM AoE groups. You will soon catch your friends up and get gold in the process.
---
I leveled a hunter first for that reason.
---
want
---
Sorry it came across that way, I only posted it because I found it interesting and wanted to share
---
i was thinking the same thing!  there is so much good information in these comments, it would be really nice.
---
O-okay.
---
A lot of things would happen if everyone just did something
---
Wuss.
---
If you're going to just sit in your room until people leave you might as well just play WoW. Or better yet, stop neglecting your social life and go enjoy yourself with your friends.
---
Wait what the fuck? Almost nothing in this image is stock...
---
The action bars have moved, there's a damage meter, there's two timer addons, the chat window is made transparent, the xp bar is at the top and it's displaying an overwhelming amount of information, portraits and health bars are dramatically moved and are displaying more information than is stock...
---
The only thing stock is the minimap, quest tracker, and buffs. So only the upper right ~10% of the screen
---
Can confirm, had to hand in like 600 stacks of runecloth for org rep
---
nice save
---
If you used auctioneer it had listed the 24hr option as 48hr as a result of being a quick port from retail.  If you update it, this has since been fixed
---
What level are you? Maybe you could try a dungeon where you are high end just to practice in. You could also read a guide for that dungeon.
---
Some general points are: attack the same target as the tank (he will either mark it with a skull, or you can click the tank and press F to get his target), let the tank pull, don't attack sheeped/sapped targets (these are marked with a moon/square) (but I've hardly seen cc's in dungeons up to now and I'm level 51)

50s for a stack is stupid high in most cases, vendor food's probably cheaper if he's sub-40, less if he cooks his own.

I know you're all looking for this, and I'm happy to oblige: https://youtu.be/yBLdQ1a4-JI

Deathcoil. From 42+ i advice to keep your distance as a rogue except you know you will one hit that warlock.
---
Not really? So many games feature perma-death nowadays, it’s not a new concept and works well on MMO games like dayz, rust, scum. It’d be cool to have one server like that in WoW imo
---
Well MY mom is 63 and it only takes her 8 minutes to  talk to deputy willem AND disable my internet and tell me to leave the house.
---
Its definitely not “live” yet, need BGs. But planning gear  and getting it all sorted can take a while. I suggest starting with google. “Classic/vanilla wow 29s twink bracket gear”
---
I’ll look into that, sounds stupid though.
---
That’s only true for nonpvp servers
---
It's the only addon I know of that provides the function he asked for. Also, a variant of it existed in Vanilla so I don't think it's going to "ruin" Classic.
---
Not trying to be a cunt or anything, but I should stop telling other people about an addon that you, yourself use? Bit hypocritical, mate. I get where you're coming from but the way what you're saying reads is "don't give this guy an advantage that I myself have over other players."

If you're good theyll friend you and ask you whenever you're on if you could tank x dungeon. If not theyll be nice till the end and then never ask you to tank ever again.
---
i went from 225 to 300 in azshara and it never took more than 10 casts per lvl, and i know that because fishingbudy has a cast count
---
I've heard there's add-ons to increase how immersive the quest feel. Maybe something to check out.
---
I lost 60lbs this year and went swimming after about 9 months and I was much less buoyant. Normally i would dive and not even try to swim back up and was used to just floating causally to the top. I dived last week and was like oh shit I actually need to swim. and doing a back stroke was much less relaxing, I could casually just pedal with my back legs. Now I have to actively try not to sink. much less fun all in all
---
Oh yeah, that did the stuff. God I love the grainy “not good” edges etc
---
This doesn't apply to warlocks or Paladins.
---
Blizzard has always banned cross-faction collusion. 
---
Making an alt to whisper the opposite faction can even get you banned.
---
I only start caring about groups for instances once the quests/early mobs in instance are about to become grey for me, within 1-2 levels. Many of the dungeons have a big gap between early and late parts, Gnomeregan/Uldaman are good examples where same player can have green quests outside instance but still be underleveled for last boss. There's actually very limited level range where it makes sense to enter these instances for quest runs.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Thanks, this is great! 
---
I ended up just going for it earlier with my great Rogue and 3 PUGs (another warrior, a mage, and a priest) and it went really well. 2-3 hairy moments and I died once during VC boss but it was generally super smooth and the other Warrior actually messaged me to ask if I really hadn’t ranked before and said I was really good :)
---
I didn't read any of that but imagine writing a novel to defend some loser manchild cause he has a lot of money haha damn
---
Rogue stealth would like a word.
---
The best answer is xp and coin drop bonuses based on the percentage difference once it swings past about 8-10% difference.
---
I like your post but it reminded me of another time when he had a great idiot warrior tank. Worst ever, never read chat, ignored what we said and for example needed some quest boss he tried ignore it for like 15min of us telling him to come before finally going there to tank, afkd, pulled when healer was oom(and even wrote it). Etc. Thought he was above us coz he was tank.
---
Well i was party leader and halfway through i just had enough and i called him out on it. Ofc he threw a fit and left. But as i told him before we didnt need him to finish so afterwards the last of us just cleaned up the instance no tank. Forgot where it was rofl but it's funny how some tanks think they can get away with anything because they are tank. Then after he left lol turns out everyone was angry with him and seriously dissed him rofl.
---
Also i am a lock, and and doing all isntances most of them multiple times on my way and currently 54 i have had a grand total of 2 or 3 healers that didn't completely refuse to heal me unless i was practically dead. I tried multiple healers that didnt heal me once for the whole run and i guess because i am a lock. And no i'm not an idiot lock just spamming that life tap constantly and making them suffer i've played lock since vanilla and one of the good ones. Healers are epic bad for your average run from what i have experienced and i always end up spending way too much combat uptime to cannibalize/spam bandages, replacing shadowbolt with drain life to keep things rolling and avoiding any mistakes on agro which will just be fatal for sure, while they are refusing to help even a bit because they wont do their role and won't bring drinks etc. Sometimes they even spam damage spells but still refuse to heal me! It's so nonsensical hahaha, it's starting to entertain me.  
---
Oh and we didn't even ge into mages refusing to do water coming up with all kinds of excuses. I just stopped bothering to ask them rofl rather life drain my way ahead and avoid arguing with them. And still doing most damage in every dungeon but wow, so far it's a lot of failers around in classic. Actually i love it, just adds fun things to remember.
---
Greens aren’t purple and my BiS doesn’t mention them... /s
---
I was thinking of making a second and third in slot list for the people who don’t want any comp on loot and don’t care as much haha
---
Feign death is really annoying for rogues. If you feign death you make him lose all his combo points.
---
If you act like an asshole you're still being an asshole..
---
Just turn them in like damn son.
---
Making an alt, feral druid. Already have "Shindiggidy" but I want something similar. Can't decide between "Shindiggle" or "Shindiggles". Shindiggles sounds more like a pet name and I will be a cat a lot of the time, but it kind of sounds juvenile?
---
on pservers it was, i’ve tried to find a reliable source on how much it cost in retail vanilla but could never find anything. honestly there’s likely two or three scenarios for why its so low
---
1. it really was that low in vanilla and pservers just got it wrong. 
---
2. blizz just didn’t notice and kept it at retail price or close
---
3. blizz stealthnerfed the vendor price because it would make pickpocketing too OP
---
it’s probably the first one, and either way not that many people care about this, and its definitely not on blizz’s priority list to address so, w/e
---
Yes making passive income and having time to pursue my dreams is the failure case, buddy.
---
And that's why he fits perfectly into classic what's your point?
---
Well yeah, he has his haters wrapped around his little pinky.
---
I would actually try BFA if I got it for free to see the changes that have happened over the years since I last played.  Not interested in fully releveling though
---
Dude, it *is.* There are some heavy aggro skills in enhance on purpose, and rockbiter is deigned exactly for this. The problem isn't the game, the problem is it's rare that I find players that understand how to use it. I've seen shamans main-tank dungeons up to the 50s, but 90% of them just want to WF DPS shit. 
---
That's a player problem, not a design problem, and it's the same issue plaguing warriors.
---
I do too...I’ve played a mage in retail since BC, and I’ve never encountered mages acting like this ever. I’m a priest in classic and still haven’t encountered mages acting this way. Guess I just haven’t grouped with jerks
---
Also the point of this thread. The discussion wasn't really about what competent players are capable of, it's moot to the topic of conversation to say that x or y are completely viable strategies.
---
We have better gear. :)
---
To be fair i’ve seen plenty of (class)tards on all sides. Had an RFD where literally noone but me as the tank brought food/water, at one point we had two people trying to heal - I sorted my Priest buddy out with mana cause he is genuinely new to the game and couldn’t find a vendor but noone else even asked.
---
That same run the Warlock was lifetapping on to 1 health and expecting heals, the Warrior not interested in tanking had Ravager and obviously out-threat me cause I didn’t have it.. all DPS would AoE on pull etc. awful run!
---
That one run put me off tanking til 60.
---
Yep this exactly, irony 101
---
There are essentially 3 ways to distribute loot:
---
1) Roll for it.
---
This will guarantee that there are no political agendas that prevent people from getting loot or people to get too much loot. However if you lack the luck you might come out with no item for several weeks straight, while someone else is fully epic equipped in the meantime. It requires people to not be too greedy to work fine. Usually comes with the extra rule to roll on only one item per run.
---
2) DKP
---
Essentially you accumulate points for being in the raid, then spend them to "buy" items with it. This favors attendance, however new players might be discouraged as they have little chance to actually get any loot. Also people tend to make secret deals with others to save DKP on otherwise expensive gear to circumvent the system.
---
3) Loot council
---
Loot is distributed to the one player who needs it most, including factors like raid attendance and skill. This is the most fair distribution of loot if the loot council is fair, however if people have secret agendas they might push all the loot to specific people and then leave the guild. Also if they hate a specific player, that guy might never receive a single piece of loot at all.
---
if you can't at least open some fucked up sounding porn tabs and get a low-res sideways photo with your phone, you lack conviction
---
I'm saying that you'd reserve the item to put such a group together.
---
Imagine falling for the oldest copypasta
---
As a healer, that int buff can save the day when just 1 more heal would have kept the tank up. It also helps that I'm a holy pally so every MP goes a long way.
---
He literally said "I have a right to **be heard**".
---
I actually don't like when my girlfriends game. It's my me-space and where I find solace. I always love spending time with my girlfriend but I don't want to discuss them or it be our activity.
---
It's my thing and they have always respected it. Then again, I don't no-life it.
---
Anyone in WoW can impact your gameplay negatively, streamer or no. Also why is the cleave meta worse than the "lets do 1 pack at a time using full CC and drinking to full after each pack, waiting carefully to mark and ask for vocal confirmation that everyone is ready and all their cooldowns are up"-meta? If people want to clear the dungeons the way they want to, who are you to demand everyone does it your preferred way?
---
If you aren't having fun with the cleave groups, just advertise your run as a slow, boring drag and you'll get group members with the same mindset.
---
Any groups Ive been in with mages they dont even wait for me to ask, they just open trade and drop 3 or 4 stacks of water in and press trade. Its great but I feel bad sometimes because I dont wanna take advantage of it, so I usually offer a free enchant as payment since we are under lvl 20 atm. 
---
Never had one get rude with me about it though.
---
I would be the guy who rolled a 4
---
Pog Elv UI is where it’s at.
---
As a lock my workaround is just giving mages a healthstone. Usually they will give water just out of gratitude.
---
Making food/warter/portals is part of my class fantasy. This entire exchange makes no sense at all.
---
Why be a mage in vanilla if you won’t want to bake cookies?
---
A massively popular Twitch streamer named Asmongold appears to have switched servers from Faerlina to Herod bringing his hoards of followers with him who farm for him and basically treat him like a god even though he's actually a minimally masculine beta cuck bundle of sticks.
---
So?
---
GOT IT  
---
\[x\] OR \[y\] do-a-thing  
---
\[x, y\] means \[x AND y\] do-a-thing
---
thanks!
---
I have not had a single rogue try demand locked chests are theirs guess I must just be lucky in that regard. They always unlock and let the roll winner have the loot most of the time they are happy to just get the skill up while doing dungeons.
---
I had to go back an forth a few times.
---
"You only invited streamers to beta"
---
https://imgur.com/sEZHcyv
---
RNG is RNG, I got in on the first wave, my account has been active since 2004 so maybe that has something to do with it? Either way they did NOT just invite only streamers, cmon now...
---
Just an FYI for you and anyone else who wasn't aware, the YouTube highlight channels that post his content are not his. They're all from people stealing his content and monetizing YouTube channels to make money from it.
---
He just doesn't DMCA them, I guess $50k/month baseline w/o including donations is sufficient enough for him, might as well let the leeches have their piece of the cake as well at that point.
---
What is you add on to see the overpower proc on the unitframe ??
---
I am just surprised nobody uploaded a video of Fozruk on Pornhub since this was posted...
---
Gonna get your ass banned here too!
---
\&gt;So I'm all for pvp
---
\&gt;you can't do real pvp against players of your own level
---
Bitch if you wanted a fair fight, go on PVE servers where you CHOOSE who you fight and thus can fight FAIRLY. If you roll on a PVP server, you check an invisible box that says "I accept that I will be ganked mercilessly forever"
---
You can do that to any video using the Opera browser, I watch some college lessons while farming stuff or just doing some chores
---
So you have a problem with a dude being a toxic jerk so in order to fix the game you decide to be a toxic jerk not only to him, but anyone else wanting to go to Orgrimmar at that particular time. Congratulations on feeding him more views and lowering the bar for the community, I guess.
---
For sure I have multiple +healing greens on, but if there's an invite available for the hat/chest, I'm going to take a chance.
---
Hottest dis track of 2019! Fuck streamer guilds and the scum alliance, long live the Mafia.
---
Yea dude, only streamers with their gaming insight have ever thought of that!  /s a r c a s m
---
Take the silver from the chest as a tip. It’s a fair compromise imo and only ever had one dude complain.. about 4 silver....
---
LOL ok yea someone downvotes me but wont explain why I can’t take a tip for providing a service. I love reddit :D
---
Well considering I'm enhance 99% of the time, you bet I'm rolling on that. I'll roll on resto stuff if no one else needs. If there is a caster who needs that, I'll pass. 
---
If a group tells me not to roll on dps gear, I'm dropping group and getting another. No one is leveling as heals.
---
Last time I did that was WotLK and by the time I got to 80 everyone else who had the same idea was flooding the server.
---
We have no queue and a near-50% ratio according to the last census but I dunno if that means we're less populated or just right or what. I do know that every zone is pretty lively still with people questing all over the place and both factions in most contested zones.
---
Streamer bad
---
Grats on the staff, but ditch the magisters for frozen wrath gear or something with spell power on it. You don't need Stam or Int on those pieces as much as you need bigger dps numbers. Dreamweave gloves for example or gloves of power. 
---
Magisters is statted terribly. Even dreadmist is better for a mage.
---
I don't think anyone was expecting a raid of strong hard men (who target level &lt;5 characters for corpse camping) were going to have any chance at anything marked boss level.
---
\*nerd screech\*
---
Same level mobs do not have high resist chance. You're wrong.
---
When mobs become orange, at least 3 levels higher, that is when your spell hit sits at 83%. The game roles a number between 0 and 1. If it's .83 and below, your spell lands, but if it's above, it misses, or "resists." Same level mobs sit at 96% spell hit, which is the same as any other mob that is green, which caps at 99% if you have hit gear or talents. There is NO difference between green or same level mobs. For example, if you're 40, you're spell hit on a level 40 mob is 96%. You'll cap this at 99% with elemental precision. That is the cap. Being a green mob doesn't increase this. Elemental precision as a mage helps even more. Farming green mobs is not as efficient as farming same level mobs and is considerably less experience, for no noticeable change in resist chance. It's math. Stop giving uninformed advice when you don't know what you're talking about. You're making things up.
---
Don't listen to this idiot. If a mob resists your pulls, cold snap, and re-frost nova. You can also rotate through 2 ice blocks, assuming you're not 60 yet, allowing you to get novas back, or you can rank 1 CoC and kite around until your nova resets. Yellow mobs are perfectly fine to farm. That is where you should be farming. Orange is too sketchy for big pulls, because they will resist nova.. a lot. There is no difference between green and yellow, except the xp loss. Obviously, there are other reasons to farm certain mobs, but from purely a resist perspective, this guy has no idea what he's talking about, which explains why he deleted and wants no one to know that he's an imbecile.
---
"This paladin just BoP'd for the third time.  I'm so fucking wet right now"
---
It became a DPS spec with the game's refinement. Unfortunately, while Shaman has some of the aggro management tools, it lacks AoE aggro-grabbing, and doesn't have the base hitpoints or armor to tank, nor the necessary damage mitigation skills.
---
It would just get attacked by the mage that the hunter is with...
---
Easy, Will of the Forsaken.
---
Then Sprint, take prep (if you're sub and dont have this wtf are you doing, respecc asap) 
---
Hack and Slash, he/she'll will try to fear you you kick that shit real good and if he/she gets that fear you just wait it out and sprint again. Use Vanish Prep Vanish when you dont have curses on you.
---
Important:
---
#Open up with cheap, then kidney and dont let that biach cast fear.
---
Alliance? Easy as well:
---
Wait the fear out, Stoneform if Dwarf, Vanish, Prep (as I said Sub without prep is like a ferari without a wheel) Cheap, Kidney, Thistle (you have to have this as a rogue cmon dude) Vanish, Cheap, Throw a hemo if you have it, or a sinister, Evas, and that warlock is dead
---
Human? Not a problem, wait it out, sprint *WAIT FOR THE CHARM OF THE SUCC* Every man for himself, Sin, Sin, Kidney, Sin Sin, Evas and so on, if you got no curses on, VANISH. Cheap and repeat above.
---
Gnome? Naaaaaaaa.
---
Nelf? Pfffft, just kick the fucker.
---
I play a mage and I even can not stand other mages. The majority are complete ass holes. So what if people ask you for water. It takes a few button clicks and as long as their respectable you've helped someone out. Also give the water / food away for free you greedy pricks. I've played a mage in vanilla, BC, wrath, cata and BfA and I've never seen so many toxic mages than I have come across now in classic. If your a mage and are in a 5 man then make two stacks of water for the mana users, ask if people need food and give out your int buff where appropriate. This takes no times to do and can be mostly done while traveling to the dungeon entrance or while waiting for others to arrive. This is part of your job as a mage. Also if your a mage your not a tank. Your not "Gods gift to Azeroth". Your a squishy sack of cloth that outputs high damage so piss off with your "pull more" bullshit because as a mage myself, doing dungeons with you, I don't want to deal with you wiping our party because you pulled half the damn dungeon. /rant
---
Edit: I know there are good mages out there that do the above and so this is not targeted at you.
---
do priests level as anything else?
---
What server is this? Heartseeker seems to be 80% alliance in questing zones...
---
You're a hunter and you didn't train traps and wing clip? That's your problem.
---
Straight up had this conversation at age 12 with a rogue named Hazards in Redridge. Dude was chill af and helped me lvl.
---
Don’t have it :( nelf
---
You have no worries when dpsing in a dungeon, just go out and try it out. As a warrior I pressume your arms, I would save rage at end of pulls as combat and pop sweeping strikes, then on pull autoattack in berserker stance and when you think he has aggro use whirlwind and cleave. That's about it. Don't worry if you overaggro, it's natural that the tank doesn't keep 100% aggro. Just be careful of your own health ofc and maybe swap to defensive stance if you take too much damage. Don't try to kite just stay by tank while continuing to dps.
---
I’m horde on rattlegore the world pvp on our server has been so fun. I participated in a full raid vs full raid in hillsbrad a couple weeks ago, was the most fun I’ve had 
---
Love our server, hope to see you on the battlefield :)
---
This
---
I mean, I haven't met a single mage that has waited for anyone else in the party, I've probably kicked 2 dozen from my dungeons so far for pulling. Its like anyone playing a mage has had their brain removed.
---
This shit was sold out the day it became available and they never restocked. Such bullshit. Oh well
---
Same I was probably there lol
---
That is an unbelievably reductionist line of thinking. People of all walks of life can enjoy the same thing despite being vastly different people, you assuming he has 50k viewers and every single one is a reflection of him and thus each other is laughable.
---
My first character on Westfall was a prot pally. Level 60 now with full pre-raid BiS (minus the shoulders and weapon which I disagree with) -- it's a lot of fun.
---
All I have to do if I wanna run something is just say LFM dps/heals and I fill within a minute. It's great.
---
START THE PLANE!
---
No will of the forsaken don’t even bother fighting them
---
Is maybe the most horde dominated realm of them all.
---
Earthshaker is really good. Moved here from Gehennas as an alliance and seems pretty much 50/50.
---
If you get feared you lose, so don't do that
---
Just don’t join Fairy Tail there are plenty of competent alliance guilds on Smolderweb
---
Yes you will get banned for using a fish-bot. Have you learned your lesson? See you in 6 months

Don't try to melee weave. It's a massive pain in the ass and only works with really good weapons + tons of practice.
---
lol no they arent, they are tank prio unless you want your tanks to join another guild
---
if tanks have them already, then they go to hunters
---
They said I was botting. I appealed and they said “The action will not be reversed or changed under any circumstances.”
---
Fuck i might use the PiP even with my two monitors, i sometimes forget to look at the other one
---
"except the losers", rushing to 60 has got to be the most boring thing you can do just to grief other players, get a fucking life
---
You sound like you got dropped on the head a few too many times mate.
---
Classic wow literally boomers malding lmao
---
It’s not making Reddit mad. It’s ruining a sever.
---
It has literally nothing to do with Reddit.
---
Hey guys, punkrateerwidanuudavideooo
---
I’m sure people ask this all the time. But which class in the mc+bwl eras do the best raid damage?
---
I was a healer in classic and I am playing with the same group of people. They were the type to pee in bottles so they didn’t miss a pull to stay top on the damage meters. 
---
They do it in a very enjoyable and non toxic way. It seemed really fun to compete.
---
I don’t care for wow at all really, but I really care about playing with my friends so my class doesn’t matter I just want to be able to out damage them for the first time ever. 
---
Leveling speed, soloability, pvp, none of it matters. Just raid dps.
---
I can read Korean. Says “Party Finding Helper”.
---
파티 찾기 도우미
---
Any reason was a good reason! Sorry I can't help 😭
---
So is there a point to get an addon that helps you track your spell latency and spellqueueing or does it automatically do that for you?
---
How much was it on pservers?
---
Did he actually? Would love it if that was true.
---
Yeah it definitely feels like there’s no recovering after I get feared
---
If your video wasn't made as a 31/21 warrior did you really even PVP?
---
what's supposed to be happening here?
---
I did appeal and they said “The action will not be reversed or changed under any circumstances.” I thought about making another account but I just can’t bring myself to level to 60 again.
---
This is heartwarming, I'm glad you had such a wonderful time.  
---
Good luck with the next raids!

I think you are standing on fenris isle looking at the cabin in altrac

Nobody cares.

~49 silver, some servers nerfed the vendor price because of how easily rogues could farm gold though. but originally it was 49

This ain't me btw, By a dude of Faerlina called Cedx

---
perfect.
---
I don't get it either, man. Like if I can read it, what's the problem?
---
Who cares? Why do you people try so hard to make yourselves sound so important? It’s all staged fake drama for views. Go away and quit bothering people with this shit.

---
So without attacking you, did you happen to remote log in with a streaming app? Do you use a service like shadow?
---
The BOE's are worth a ton. Shadowfang/Assasin's Blade are hundreds of gold each. 19 twinks

Been playing tank as an alt.  So far, it has been mostly ok, but I have seen a few examples of reckless DPS, whom I swear actually attempted to steal DPS the whole time.  Everyone was over leveled and we had 2 hybrids though, so maybe no one saw any risk of wiping.  Not sure if I would make it my main, but its pleasant enough for the time being.  It definitely is nice to know that whenever I want a particular dungeon, I can bet money there is a group just waiting for me.

People's hair can change in childhood, my dad was blonde and was completely black hair by teenage years.

Lmao, I love this game.
---
Ye and now warn all players, tell them to leave and i will end up on a  20/80 server. Because the smallest imbalance is worth it to switch and generate an even worse ratio?
---
I don't keep up much, but from what I know McConnel wanted to play a shaman.
---
Thanks for answering, that was probably the case which confused me!
---
The thing is, I wasn’t botting. Just mindlessly fishing to get through my slow work day. I still haven’t received a call today and my shift isn’t over for 2 hours. Wow is what I was using to hold me over
---
They existed, but they weren't even close in popularity  to when it was at its peak after Soda began talking about it.

also firas zahabi is the trainer at tristar gym, where the likes of GSP and rory macdonald train.
---
This is kinda my fetish tbh.
---
I defeated this guy just earlier today for the first time! Nice Art!
---
You're wrong.
---
You roll for chests against your wife? Was this in a larger party?
---
No. I work from home and was just fishing away, waiting for a call to come in.
---
It's reasonably common.
---
However its purpose is to funnel loot to particular players that benefit the group the most to help with progression.
---
Seeing how even most pugs are 10/10 in MC loot council just seems like a bad idea at this point since progression really isn't a thing right now in classic.  Makes way more sense down the line once content gets a little less brain dead autopilot.
---
Easy, just use [racial ability only one race has]!
---
great advice guys
---
Ive seen it on here a few times already, and I thought I had it saved. But I just hit 50. And I know I'm gonna need to start attuning and getting my pre bis in order soon. But can someone link me that thread that was posted on here that was like "what you should start doing before you hit 60" or something like that? It was a list of attunement quests, and other good things to do in the 50 to 60 level range.
---
Thanks!!
---
Why're you posting this on this sub? This isn't asmon's personal sub. He has one, go post it there.
---
bruh thanks this is abd asss!!!!
---
Read my post, you'll get them in no time, if I get reds for my clips so ez, then so can you, gear is no excuse.
---
That is not what he does. Why are you making shit up?   
---
He kills same level mobs, or even a level or 2 higher, quite often during his grind to 60. Hell, he went to Tanaris at 42 to grind those pirates, some of which were 45. I swear, some of you just invent random shit and pretend like it exists so that you can act like you have useful information to give to people. It's pathetic.
---
How long did it take you to get used to shift 1 etc? I've played for like 13 years without ever having keybinds because it feels so uncomfortable to use shift. I guess it's just worth trying to power through tho
---
You already admitted to having a bot program on your computer that you used, since you "work from home". Just admit you got caught doing something you shouldn't have been, it's a lot easier.
---
Polite? Check. Self depricating? Check. Accepting of others as part of the community? Check.
---
Is favourable to asmon so showered with downvotes? Check.
---
Stay classy Herod.
---
Sounds like marriage to me
---
Just imagine if there was voice chat lol
---
Well there’s still plenty of time to level before the other phases come out and by then you may be able to transfer that character to your older account
---
Super glad I don’t care enough to be sucked into this retard’s power fantasy.
---
Hey Asmon, I want an apology for you being an attention whore while the rest of us have lives and limited play time. Also I’m on Deviate Delight. Cum git me.
---
The server was already shit. The imbalance is the worst Ive seen.. even back in vanilla horde wasnt this overplayed.
---
Arcane subtlety, but it isn't a priority over the frost tree, or even elemental precision. You get it later, just after 40.
---
Power through it. It didn't take terribly long. I saw some friends use ctr 1,2,3,4,5 as well and that felt impossible so I didn't do it. Now that would be very comfortable for me. Just like playing an instrument.
---
nah bro, it's a mage's responsibility to make water and food for their parties, and any who don't should be be promptly replaced. You didn't come up to them in the middle of ORG while they were doing something and spam them, it's their job.
---
healers shouldn't be rolling on felt hat there are a ton of better options, you can literally buy a holy shroud off the AH for 1-2g
---
I envy you :( paid 400g today for spellpower enchant
---
Yeah Stonespine drops a nice cloak. It's white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
yikes...
---
why do you insist on continuing past that point; it becomes two retards mud wrestling
---
&gt; If you are casting a spell at a member of the opposing faction, the opponent can just walk through you at the end of your cast and it won’t go off.
---
Wait so how does not keyboard turning help? I was under the impression that turning with a mouse would require movement (left and right click at the same time) so you'd cancel the spell anyway? You can turn on the spot with the mouse?
---
As mongo
---
Geraldo good
---
Uh, what?  
---
Not sure about your math, but for one lethality doesn't affect ambush.  
---
Second, I'm not sure if you're even factoring in AP which is a huge part of ambush damage with the way it works.  300 AP, for example, gives basically 100 damage.  
---
Third, even deleting 1/2 of a mob's health with the first 60 AP is huge.  Combat can't come close to doing that.  Max rank garrote only does 550 damage over 18 seconds... for 50 energy.  
---
Third, you don't have to "Save" 105 energy.  You just gouge as soon as you have more than 45 because with a 5.5 second gouge you almost guarantee you will have 60 energy before the gouge ends.  This stops you from taking damage for 5.5 seconds as well as put out a large amount of damage on the target with backstab.
---
Your post fail to explain why.
---
Nice try, mate.  Learn to write.
---
What’s the good argument
---
Just deal with a giant man baby coming in and completely destroying any markets that were growing and generally making the game unplayable. 
---
Just deal with it bro
---
I play mage and hopefully I can convince some of you that we're not all like this..
---
My water and food are free and my ports cost whatever you feel like in my book.
---
&gt; That's not what I said so stick those words back in your own fucking mouth.
---
yikes no need to get angry lmao. I said that's how it READS from what you posted, not that's what you meant. Chill.

Those enslaved elementals are tough
---
Miner? I barely even know her

Because it’s fun and easy?  Next question.

Dps warrie with ravager is the best tank for quite a while.

Lol. I ran sfk two days ago as a 25 priest. And a lvl 21 shaman we were nice enough to drag through need rolled robes of arugal.. i was heated when i lost them.
---
&gt;Says the guy who wants to act like it's a big deal to post a dumb screenshot on the internet for strangers.
---
Have you seen this subreddit? Have you seen reddit?
---
Practically  the entire site is funny pictures.
---
Warrior doesn't have the AoE grabbing worth a toot either, except once every 10 minutes for a few seconds... Paladins are Kings of this, and druids to an extent.
---
Your other points though are absolutely where Shamans fall behind. Still, I've seen more than a few perform adequately in a pre-raid MT 5-man role.
---
Can someone explain to me what attuning is? I keep hearing it tossed around that people "need to attune soon" or "I'm attuning for Onyxia" but I have no idea what that means?
---
HA
---
OMG.... this x1000000
---
All i could read whas: " Her boyfriends friend was friends with the friend who introduced me.." --&gt; " so it makes sense...".  
---
Right. I stopped trying to solve this one, several attempts ago. Wait..
---
You to my man!
---
There’s no wrong way to play. If people want to start new characters and try new things, they should do that whenever they want.
---
You think that is the party life of a guy that played WoW in college? Seriously?
---
Manual reckoning procs are confirmed to work on classic wow, just not how it did on private servers.
---
On private servers it was enough to sit down so you were crit and you gained a reckoning charge. On classic you need to bind the sit/stand function to a hotkey, sit down so you receive a crit and then manually stand back up using the sit/stand bind. If you do it properly the server batching allows reckoning to proc.
---
Hence why I said you'd gain serious RSI if one were to attempt it. You need to constantly mash a button just to make it work. It's not worth it.
---
I actually love the use of “yikes” so I have nothing bad to say here.  
---
It’s the perfect low effort response, and I use it all of the time.
---
Because when you start handing it out, people start expecting YOU to bring portals and water to THEM. I'm telling you this out of experience, if you don't insist people just open trade they'll be asking you to come to Feralas real quick to give them a portal back to IF with no tip.
---
I have no problem giving water, food or portals. But you better walk your ass over here and open trade instead of me having to keep a list of which of the 20 mana users we've already given water to and which still need it.
---
Just
---
Open
---
Trade
---
Give it a shot and see how you like it.
---
WHERE IS THE TRAINER. I feel like I’m dying in upgrades and I only hit 32 💀
---
Fellow Holy Priest here; yes farming felcloth is a chore and slower than some other classes but it's not only *doable* but actually pretty easy! Bonus the demonic runes you can use in dungeons and raids that don't share the cooldown with potions.
---
Yeah because fuck streamers and the community that survives by sucking the excrement left behind in their wake.
---
Interesting... but unrelated. The wow character is named after the dev, Alex Afrasiabi.
---
does that mean its bad that im playing alliance?

LOL

How long does it take to get used to that? A couple of months? Curious about trying but considering I've always used default keybinds it's a big undertaking

Sure, edit your comment to make it appear less pointed, then complain about my response.

Ok, that makes me feel at ease. The way it was worded made it sound like the add on detected stealthed players.

In the interface option. There should be a box to untick that's called like "error sounds" or "error voice" something like that.
---
So i can’t get into raids as a Shadow Priest?
---
why is he owed niceness? he openly is okay with toxicity and his fanbase is full of the worst "people" imaginable, is this supposed to be likeable behaviour?
---
You only get shards from mobs you can get exp from.  Maybe he was too high level for the mobs you were fighting.
---
I see one post tho
---
Same delema I'm facing with ret pally
---
I have a 30 in everything but a mage thats 22, phase 2 isnt close yet and I wanted to do all the starter zones and quests and enjoy the game slowly. That ended up being a mistake cause all the zones are camped by 60s griefing for the lols.
---
This is gold
---
Just use Bartender and leave the original blizzard bars as is and simply add one more bar. Should work :)
---
I use inner focus to cast it at the beginning of the instance and it's up again by the first boss.
---
Distracts slows you down. Maybe if it didn't cost energy id consider it.
---
F
---
Very possibly true. Skeram was offered free transfers to Heartseeker because they are a high population server. Skeram has a high faction imbalance, causing many alliance players to deem the realm "unplayable", and they are leaving in mass to Heartseeker.
---
You'll be hard pressed to push out a mage or warlock for ranged DPS
---
No I didn’t... closest thing I have is AHK which is not a bot program and used for my work. 
---
Edit additionally blizzard says here they don’t ban for it unless it’s being abused. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/can-i-be-banned-for-using-autohotkey/75928/5
---
Mages really are the new huntard. This is just another reason.
---
Always land in gadget then fly!!!
---
More like, when I need to go somewhere I'm doing one of two things, a dungeon or something where I'll make back the cost of the flight in droves or something where the cost sunk in is irrelevant. If you feel like FP costs are impacting your funds in any way, you're probably doing a whole host of other inefficient things.
---
Yes.
---
I’ve asked in /1 for water and have always been offered some by a friendly mage. I’ve never seen this kind of response in general chat, much less in groups. Isn’t that like a priest in your group not giving you fortitude because you could have gotten a stamina scroll instead?
---
depends on which i think. i prefer to avoid them, especially the toxic streamer/communities, but there are a few that are relaxed and seem more mature to play with but they tend to be smaller.
---
I was on your side until this comment. It's really not that hard to give a couple pointers, and yeah there's a lot of new players around here hoping to pick up some tips, what's so bad about that? Everyone sucked at some point.
---
That's the only thing I can think of, I'm sorry my dude :( is this the only game you really play?
---
What bar add-on? Bartender4 doesn't seem to be working for me
---
People like the dude you're replying to should realize that he's simply being stupid by saying that it's the mages responsibility to deliver water.
---
It's not. We're vending machines. You approach a vending machine and tell it what you want, and it supplies it. A vending machine does not deliver, and the idea that it's the responsibility of the mage to run around to every single member of a raid with a manabar and ensure they have water, instead of each individual manabar making sure to hit up a mage to pick up some stacks, is honestly idiotic.
---
what? if he was working from home why can't he just be on his computer and playing normally? I'm sure he did something else but your logic doesn't follow
---
People just want priests and pallys to heal lol it's sad but yea
---
Oh, the irony.
---
It doesn't take a genius to realize that warriors go well with rogues and windfury totem. This isn't a thing popularized by streamers it's just common fucking sense.
---
Haha so true! He’s like a 12-year old at the end of a prayer: “innamejsschrsAMEN”
---
Dominos has less compatibility issues with other mods IMO, and a nicer UI
---
wash yer back
---
they would never get all the spots. people are crafty and would manage to find more.
---
You should dude, it’s interesting an if it’s therapeutic to ya, go ahead!
---
Thank you
---
First time?
---
Running around in badlands at 60 getting my mining up and i get a whisper from a mage asking for help on his lvl40 mage quest where he has loot the golem boss in uldaman. We go in as 2 and i kill the boss for him, and hes ever so grateful. 
---
Fast forward a few weeks and i get a mail, its the same mage who has now hit 60, Thanking me again, and having attached 10g to his mail. I was so heartfelt about him remembering me from that encounter we had earlier. I saved the letter and put it in my bank and added him afterwards :)
---
You've never played a mage. Mages are vending machines. Vending machines \*do not\* deliver, and it is completely nonsensical for you to expect mages to keep track of who in the raid has gotten water and who hasn't. It's every manabar's responsibility to find a vending machine and open trade, at which point it's the mages responsibility to throw the appropriate product in trade and hit accept.
---
I'd recommend checking out Skarm - [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ) 
---
I've only just started tanking in Classic  (after playing dps warrior in retail since MoP) and Skarm's guides have been super useful for builds, items, strategies and general tips. His stuff gets pretty high level, but he explains it well and I'm sure you'll find some help in his videos.
---
Not as much as I've spent on ammo for myself and food for my pet.
---
I noticed this too. What's even dumber is that Ratchet doesn't have direct flights to Gadgetzan even though they're both run by the Steamwheedle Cartel. Immersion = destroyed
---
Fuck, really? I’ve DEd a lot of greens.
---
The action bar is vaguely where it goes, the chat window is transparent by default, the xp bar is different, portraits can be moved with the stock up and that is a common place to move them to...
---
What part of this is wrong, /u/Lemonface?
---
Yeah it just breaks immersion.
---
From their comment history they appear to be one of those toxic players. Awful people never want to be held accountable for their actions.
---
Ah, good old 3-minute-mage compilations.
---
What about Dinshiggidy?
---
Safe spotting is actually grounds for account suspension. Most definitely report with screen shots.
---
I second this.
---
If they cast detect traps while stealthed, it does alert you of their presence. Not their location or direction though.
---
are you mostly dps? i put shield bash and pummel on the same key. can't imagine doing it any other way. (also rogue kick and pally stun go there.)
---
Damned mana issues.
---
It wasn't designed for BoP's.  When did anyone ever make this claim?
---
Why? didn't have a warrior around? he did the work for the gear? 
---
How was the difference?
---
Back in Vanilla I geared out a druid and used to tank trash, but I'm curious about the big guy...
---
I edited my comment to elaborate on why you need to chill. This isn't an attack on you. Your original comment just read as hypocritical.
---
Common sense?  It was removed in MoP because of pandemics interaction with warlocks and soul swap being a thing.  Why do people ask for a source all over reddit when we have google.  This isn’t particularly hard to find yourself.
---
Man, my healer cursed me out for not being able to control 6 mobs when some pats showed up. I had running the same dungeon for a few hours with no problems, then this dude told me to study up. Then he looked for a new tank.
---
Got asmondheart
---
It’s just a game. Don’t ever skip on real life events to play, you won’t regret it a few years from now. The game isn’t going anywhere.

Was that a dwarf priest? Praise to you.
---
yes, shard has it on whitemane alliance
---
Those people are just bad. I don't get it tbh, when you use it correctly, Life Tap is so god damn overpowered in Classic. In a good group, you can just constantly remain at ~80% HP and Mana troughout an entire dungeon just by bandaging once in a while and being smart with your dots and wanding.
---
Gz man!
---
MD ruin is good because succubus charm is a reliable safe CC.
---
Ya a lot of the classes don't open up and get fun till mid 40 level 50
---
Humans don't have every man for himself in classic unless I've been playing my rogue wrong the whole time
---
Ok looking back I can definitely see that I worded it badly... sorry. Yeah, I played on private servers for years leading up to Classic and everyone would cheer come ZG because “the debuff limit” got removed. Thinking about that it makes no sense since there’s still very much a limit, just an increased one.
---
What server are you on? I've been seeing similarly suspiciously priced banana bread on Kirtonos
---
What is the add on that shows auction price and dis enchant value?
---
I remember lining up to kill the scarlet npc. Never seen that happened before in wow. lol
---
This is my pain.  Every class seems so fun but I want a 60
---
unexpected pats are on the whole party to properly handle, not just you as the tank.  Your healer was just a jerk.
---
top guilds cross faction colluding to farm devilsaurs so no one else can get them is definitely "degrading the experience for other players", which is absolutely against ToS.
---

---
make of that what you will, they are going to be punished soon
---
Exposing yourself as an fangay so easily.... tsk tsk
---
Mages that aoe as soon as you charge and never poly or decurse, warlocks that never use Curse of Recklessness on humanoids and dot every single mob in the dungeon, priests that don't purge silences or poisons, rogues always attacking the wrong target, hunter's pets with growl on auto, I love tanking but I can understand why there's a shortage :D
---
In PvE. The amount of rogues I have charged, rended to prevent stealth and then hamstrung and killed in PvP is dusgusting, and I am only 38. Probably because I spend all my time chasing down Allies.
---
I love playing rogue as well, but it depends on what you are fighting. You aren't getting away from some classes.
---
I mean there is a big gap between "You should always help someone if you can" and just not raging about even being asked, especially when in a group with someone. I wouldn't hold anything against someone not helping a random out in the world, but it's definitely fucking weird to just ignore and then berate a party member like that.
---
Yeah it was in a dungeon otherwise we just leave loot on ffa and split loot ourselves lol
---
I went holy/disc at level 48 but still took lifetap. It's still been pretty easy over and Mana generally isn't an issue.
---
To =/= too
---
Much not mutch
---
No worries! Thanks for explaining!
---
For me it's that I wanted to bake cookies and conjure crystal clear spring water, not roleplay a pizza delivery dude running around making deliveries. You want water, come get it and I'll fucking drown you, but when I have to cast for 40 seconds straight to conjure the shit I don't want to also waste time running around handing it out and having to keep track of which of the 40 raiders already have water and which of them don't.
---
A major difference in playing mage on private servers and in classic is that on pservers people wouldn't even ask for water, they'd just open trade and expect you to figure it out. In classic people ask for water and then just stand there staring wide-eyed like an owl that needs glasses, often 20 yards away.
---
It's not a res in the traditional sense, no. It's a second life on a half hour cooldown.
---
Was having the same issues last night in Booty Bay.
---
Onyxia requires you to complete a quest chain before you can enter the instance. Molten core also requires a quest, but that is only 1 quest done in BRD.
---
Ye. I was going to use the restroom myself but then I took an arrow in the knee.
---
here is the thing i get not handing out water in the open world that shit is annoying. not doing it in dungeons is like do you not want a fast clean run? it is part of the tool kit you bring to the dungeon group. it is like warriors not stance dancing to taunt mobs of the healer or even just mocking blow it. being the off-tank is part of the warrior toolkit for dungeons.
---
they control the source as well
---
I’ve played both factions extensively and can 100% confirm this.
---
&lt;3 That is awesome, I had a moment like that too.
---
Friendly reminder he is a millionaire and could spend $15 and purchase a 2nd account but he has chosen to ruin a server lol.
---
Funny how he has become exactly the kind of self-obsessed streamer he made fun of in his Youtube video from back in the day.
---
It depends what you like about wow, if you want competitive PVE/PVP content as opposed to the MMORPG feel of classic, you'll enjoy retail. 
---
I like to think of retail as a hack n slash sort of game, where I play because I enjoy the raids/m+ and my classes in them. If you've never played it before it'll take some getting in to tho.
---
You can use your phone you know.
---
Not on Sundays
---
DOT snapshotting was how dots worked until mists. it literally just means that whatever spellpower / buffs you have active when you cast the dot will affect the dot for the entire duration (that is, DOT damage is calculated when you cast the spell). Mists was when it was changed to be dynamic (it recalculates the DOT damage on every dot tick based on your current spellpower and active buffs).
---
Also because of raiding gameplay in vanilla, its tough to find video examples of it, because generally you don't use dots in raids. it wasn't until BC that snapshotting actually became widely used as a gameplay mechanic, because thats also when saw haste more and in vanilla spell haste didn't affect dots. 
---
can't really find a source of when it was 'added' because it never was 'added.' It was just removed lol. Its something that was always in the game but hardly impacted gameplay until later versions. I just noticed its not in the game bc im a shadow priest.
---
What's with people talking about certain realms being streamer servers or non streamer ones? That's not an official thing surely?
---
I don't even respond to them. https://imgur.com/gallery/xdPjh

Nearly every leveling warrior is arms, deal with it or wait to find a leveling protection spec warrior lfg for your specific instance at the same exact time as you without a dedicated group of friends to play with.
---
Sorry for my lack of knowledge, but can you cannibalize player corpses?
---
Well there technically is 1 spot for a shadowpriest for your debuff to buff shadowbolt damage, but most organized guilds will want to funnel your gear to mages and warlocks first, as they are more useful. Id be pissed as a mage if the RL let memespecs roll for my gear when i do 2 times their damage
---
Guilty as charged.
---
Because levelling to cap in Classic is such a grind you have to be damn sure you want to play that class in end game. My main is a shaman and I’ve managed to level him to 31 so far. That’s taken a few weeks. It’s a slow nasty process. 
---
The other day on a whim I decided to roll an alliance Hunter. I’ve never played Hunter in vanilla before and never played alliance either. It was a breath of fresh air as all the content is new and fresh for me. I’m now level 22 after a weekend of play. It’s fast, exciting and fun.
---
For the first time ever in my time in WoW I’m actually levelling skinning and leatherworking, cooking, fishing and first aid. I haven’t had so much fun in WoW ever. I’m able to make enough gold to buy all my spells, level all the profs and make my own gear and even give away gear to people I help while levelling. WoW is FUN again.
---
I’ll get to 60 in my own time, I don’t care about the destination because for me Classic is about the journey. Take your time, enjoy the little things and play whatever class you feel like, even if that means rerolling until you find your happy place.
---
What the fuck is wrong with people. I give out water like candy, its free. I'm stuck mid 30s at the moment, I feel guilty not giving them better water!
---
Children.
---
If you are expecting every random in a dungeon to be playing optimally and only rolling on their BiS gear and nothing else you are going to be constantly disappointed. People will roll on items that are upgrades not just what is the best possible item for that slot.
---
I always forget it's standard practice for people to tip me when I pick locked boxes for people and just click the skill then hit accept.  Every time except once someone has made me click accept a second time because they put 10-30 silver in the trade after I'd already hit it the first time. 
---
It's instant cast in the trade window and it almost always improves my skill so it never bothers me.
---
the confusing part to me has been the fact mages has never buffed me with int as a warrior. i do benefit from int it helps with my skill ups and if i am leveling likly my one-handed weapon skill sucks hard the mage could help fix that way quicker had he just buffed int on me.
---
A lot of hardcore getgudnoob edgeebois pick the Undead as their primary race because they look cool. It used to be my favorite race when I was a teenager, but in my adult life I find things to be way more relaxed as a Tauren. Spend enough time in Thunder Bluff and you won't wish ill on anyone.
---
This reminds me, I just started on a PvP server that my IRL buddy wanted me to join because it's the one he's on now (I switched from my other PvE server to join, should probably give those folks my gold) and I saw a Guild advertisement for a Guild named after something in an Anime. I had to join because there was actually a Guild I joined back near the end of WoD named it and the guy running it would NOT stop asking me to join, but he tried to be so sly about it always saying I could join if I want to eventually leading me to join up with them. Throughout the end of WoD we played up until Legion (so for like nearly a year) where we transferred servers for raiding and such because our old server was dead. I join this Guild on the new server in Classic and I ask the guy some questions, come to find out HE CREATED THE ORIGINAL GUILD AND GAVE IT TO THE GUY WHO INVITED ME! I know because his name seemed a bit familiar, and I realized why, it's because my buddy (the guy who invited me in WoD) ended up telling me about how the guy made the Guild in MoP and he ended up quitting giving him the Guild. It turns out he remembered all of the old members who I just so happen to actually know and talk to sometimes. I'm currently trying to get a hold of him to give him details regarding contacting some of the old Guildies because it was honestly just pure fucking luck.
---
&gt; If you knew how many healthstones I’ve handed out, then an hour later ask do you need another healthstone to hear no still got the one I have, perhaps you would understand why it feels pointless to hand them out to everybody.
---
It certainly is a small waste of time to hand them out preventively. They aren't really needed as long as you have a half-decent group, because it's an emergency button more than anything. There are some exceptions of course, and I will never refuse to give one to someone who ask.
---
Also make sure to turn on tutorials
---
Wasn't a queue when I logged in.
---
Christ dude, chill out
---
The streamer guild on the alliance is running the mafia
---
Thunder Bluff is my favorite city. It’s not the easiest to get around for sure, but it looks so cool. And Tauren are the best.
---
Tbf, editing a comment after someone has responded to the original is a real cunt move.
---
The action bar is where it goes, vaguely a little farther right because the mini bar was moved, and the portraits can be moved in the vanilla UI.
---
It's not stock, but it definitely isn't far.
---
get the addon fishbringer. it shows how many casts you need for lvlup and it shows the required skill to get 100% catchrate in the zone. got 300 at lvl 35.i fished a lot in dustwallow and some in feralas
---
Yeah direct flights are usually more expensive than ones with a layovers!
---
Long live the Cartel then, lmao.
---
I still use those robes as a level 42 priest
---
This right here. You only need one shadow priest to buff up the locks due to the shadow priests’ ‘shadow weaving’. 
---
Unfortunately, like was mentioned, you’re not gonna be first in line for gear. 
---
For pve, go shadow allll day. Then respec endgame.
---
Okay so I was just doing Sunken Temple and got Edgemasters Handguards from a random drop. Everyone freaked and I see it's worth 450g but can someone tell me why? Is it just bc it's epic gear? As a level 51 DPS warrior should I just use it or sell it?
---
The addon “Details” has a built in threat-meter
---
The irony of losing a chest to Buns....
---
You’re either a chest or buns guy, you get to be both :)
---
Start with cheap shot, not ambush. Blind the pet, SS to 4 combo points, kidney shot &gt; vanish &gt; ambush and they should be dead
---
Partially because you're not going to find a source when snapshotting was added because it was never 'added' and was always in the game
---
Yeah, I’m not a huge gamer. Wow is pretty much the only game I ever really enjoyed, besides Enemy Territory in the early 2000s.
---
Yes. Once you go to  a pvp server and experience open world encounters youll never go back to boring pve emote server.
---
Has anyone seen my frog?   
---
Who took my frog?
---
p.s. I'll find my frog.

no, its 2019 learn to use a fucking computer

SPriest are great in dungeons and pvp, unwanted in raids. Always exceptions, meme guilds will take an Spriest in raids, but they may not complete AQ or Naxx.
---
Yes, hold right mouse button and drag to turn. It’s much faster than keyboard turning.
---
Jumper cables are from golem lord, just before guzzler
---
Maybe other classes need to accept that there's no need to be at 100% all the time
---
I always feel bad doing a single lifetap because healers immediately panic and heal. I don't want the heals! I have 2 healing spells and healthstones
---
Ahhh that’s fine for me then. I’m clearly not even a slightly a tryharder. Just want to have fun and do some dungeons and maybe raids. Thanks!
---
It's because weapon skill is immensely valuable as a DPS stat. Especially if you don't have the racial for it (are not Orc or Human).
---
If you are serious about DPSing as a warrior and are not one of these races, strongly consider equipping them.
---
Try codex. It does the same but you can type /codex clean and then individually choose from quest log what to show
---
i think its because the term itself 'dot snapshotting' wasn't actually called that until later expansions. before then it was just how dots worked
---
Everything you've mentioned / quoted from is from the person i'm argueing against.
---
You even brought up ppm which i have already.
---
So again, what misinformation have I spread?
---
You can totally level to 60 again! Create a new account, pick a diff class, and enjoy the ride again! You’ve got this!
---
i am sitting at around 25% of mages being total asshats but at the same time i haven't grouped up with a lot of mages. one demanded bigger pulls but gave me no time to grab aggro so he died called me a bad tank and left the group. had an other saying we were going too slow so left the group that had taken 20+ minutes to form and get started. the third refused to buff in on me as a warrior when i needed weapon skill ups inorder to hit anything.
---
Instead of that can I get the link to your incredibly shitty and not very relevant online comeback copypasta?
---
Can confirm
---
If I switch off the Lock to blind the pet I’m going to lose my combo points, right?
---
It seemed to happen when I put all the fish I had farmed on the AH. I wonder if they have some trigger for putting to many fish up. I must have posted a few hundred.
---
I figured an appeal would be easy since I was also engaged in conversation with friends and my guild while I was fishing.
---
Nah, my other character was a warlock. He was the right level, had plenty of opportunities to get shards. It just boggled my mind, considering I always fill up my own soul bag.
---
Semihardcore is popular in North America too and is the term I’ve always seen used for the ~US50-150ish range of the raiding scene. I’ve never heard of midcore, but I don’t doubt people call it that as well.
---
The tanks give horror stories because they don't want tank competition. 
---
Being a tank is only bad when you don't know what you're doing as a leader, because as a tank, you're essentially leading the dungeon whether you're party leader or not. 
---
It's your fault if targets aren't being focused, or if people aren't standing at the right spot. 
---
With that being said tanking is also extremely boring, especially if you roll druid.
---
I just realized that you're only at level 40 content with these and that makes me happy that we'll be seeing so much more, especially of the higher level content
---
Well, it's the exact same scenario.
---
Most: Badlands, gimme that iron ore.

Any tips to tank at low levels? I’m 25
---
I went prot since I love dungeons and have a priest friend. Was repeatedly told it’s pointless to talent protection. The talents are wasted untill endgame and all I need is a shield . So I re trained 
---
I went into arms. What should I be doing rotation wise? I try to sunder why I can when I have he rage. Cast revenge and shield block when I see it. Taunt off healers and such. Either way it still seems like I’m not in control. 
---
Any tips on talents and ability rotations now ?
---
subltlety rogue my friend.
---
During Vanilla I knew a guy who leveled 6 troll hunters to level 60 on the same server. I asked him why and he said "I like leveling hunters".
---
This is a video game, a leisure activity, the game/friends/community/competition can be a lot of fun but don't make it out to be something more than it really is.
---
Owls with Screech are my preferred solo pet.  Do plenty of DPS to hold aggro, debuff enemies to reduce damage, sturdier than cats, etc.
---
Turtle = bad. Slow dps = doesn’t hold threat.
---
Ez clap.
---
You can't make up for gear by "spending more time learning your class". How are you going to make up a skill gap as a frost mage when 100% of your damage is from frostbolt. It literally just about who hits and crits more, and that's the person with better gear.
---
Sweaty anime feet sounds like a good guild to me.
---
For horse it’s cheaper to go .Org &gt; Tanaris &gt; Ungoro, than .Org &gt; Ungoro
---
Didn’t he say he wasn’t going to take donations in Classic?
---
Oh yes, right, every weapon is a hunter weapon XD
---
I'm old fashioned. If the dps dies first, it is the dps fault. If the tank dies, it's the healers fault. If it was the healer, then tank gets the blame. But to repeat, that dps... they pull, and they die, well, sucks to be them, no one is out there to heal them, so as I said, they are at fault for their own death. Should have throttled their damage.
---
Detect traps is passive, you might be thinking of disarm trap.
---
The first 70 (on my server I'm not sure about world first) when TBC released was basically doing cleave. Just ran dungeons over and over.
---
You can macro blind on mouse over

Yeah bro the screenshot is absolutely hilarious. I'd show it off at a party it's so funny.

Hey I was born in 2002 as well! I started playing with my dad when I was like five. Crazy how this game can attract so many different types of people.

LMAO

They may not even complete MC or BWL...

I'm literally there leveling right now, doing all the quests. Twice at 53 and more at 59 for gear and xp.

Hunters use int over stam if they are worth a damn whilst doing anything other than pvp. Int is a hunters second best stat and spirit is as good for hunter as it is for nearly evey class that doesnt have some special interaction.
---
Your profile picture is Fortnite; gonna have to pass on this one.
---
If they have VW pet out you need to control them with total precision and accuracy or they will pop their shield and fear you and dot you down and you're done. I would recommend something very simple here, you just need to hit ambush, immediately blind, restealth and re ambush. They shouldnt have a chance to pop their VW shield or dot or fear if you do it right, ambush and then immediately mash your blind hotkey. Restealth, open with ambush, hit them wit a kidney shot and pray that you can finish them off before it wears off. You could also use vanish if they are still alive and immediately reopen with cheap shot or a third ambush if they are still standing. If you are specced into ambush damage and crit chance, nothing should remain alive after being ambushed 3 times.
---
It’s great being able to blow people up in PvP, but the lack of survivability wore me down. I played sub till level 36 and really wanted to fight the meta and not play combat but honestly dps wise it doesn’t come close. I did a run with a lower level combat rogue than myself and he doubled my dps.
---
Besides, getting detected by mobs completely ruins the ambush and will often cause casual grinding to be more risky. It was not for me.
---
MonkeyQuest can show all 20 on the screen at once. Used it in vanilla and someone revived it for Classic.

To be fair to the mage. I've been in groups where they whine for the mage to buff but constantly chain pull and don't let the mages get their mana back after buffing.
---
At 54, I'd go with [Resurgance Rod](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17743) from Mara, at least that's a quest reward so RNG can't rape you.
---
"haha no ur wrong xd"
---
Care to elaborate instead of memeing?
---
They were referring to C4: Cookie's Casual Cruise Cove.
---
The priest dps set at 60 though is super annoying to build since the tier sets are not for dps. You will basically be using almost all blues all the way into BWL (Phase 3) (some shadow pieces will be available in phase 2 when kazzak and azuregos come out)
---
The leveling gear is not going to be any different for priests because you dont start getting spellpower on gear until way late.
---
Long story short, yes, but it took a couple days before I did though. 
---
On the days off it was nice, I played some Switch games I had backlogged, I read some of my books, I got to bed early, but no exaggeration the entire time I was doing those things I was thinking about WoW, or on /r/classicwow, or watching a WoW stream. I couldn't escape it. Plus it felt unfinished which kept nagging at me. 
---
I talked to my wife about it, she told me to resub but I still took a day after that to decide. I thought she was sick of me playing so much, but we both agreed that I need to A) Handle 1 or more chores before playing and B) Spend time with the wife before playing, which I have been doing.
---
Still missing a lot of reading and movies, but WoW is hot right now, the books and movies will be there forever.
---
I live playing druid and making groups is ez. Got 31 into feral and 21 into reato do all 3 roles. I just wish bears were good for raiding
---
EDIT: 20 INTO RESTO
---
It is because these garbage mods believe that everything that does not use 100% wow source material is low effort. No joke, this is what the rules state, if you are using a picture from something else it makes it low effort.
---
Been seeing alot of posts about this lately. As a warrior fanatic myself to some extent I agree, you can tank dungeons pretty easily as any spec with a little practice and experience.
---
But I hate tanking, and im actually really good at the role, but it requires alot of effort. 
---
As a good tank im marking mobs with CTRL 1-5 non stop, kill skulls sheep moons etc. I have to methodically plan out pulls and careully LoS packs while also hoping they dont scatter or aggro more.The worst feeling as a tank is chasing mobs around trying to hit them with something and having your group frantically try to get away.
---
Its alot of responsibility and can be exhausting compared to a dps role where they just attack skull and dont gave to spend put the same ammount of focus and concentration. Hell if you stop sundering or revenging for 5 seconds the mobs will run loose. 
---
This makes me feel like im doing a bad job, like if anything bad happens its my fault. Its more common for wipes to actually be the fault of the other group players but it doesnt feel that way as a tank.
---
I am dad leader, and I have alot of responsibilities. Sometimes i just want to not have responsibility and mindlessly attack targets. So let me.
---
Gottem
---
Harassement?
---
Curious about his: Where do you get your gear for PVP from if not from raiding?
---
Legitimate question, always thought raiding was mandatory for gear to PVP
---
uhhh how is it unbalanced to die from someone 20 levels above you?
---
You can fish to level 300 in even the lowest zone. The only thing that matters is the number of fish you catch. And yes, of course as you get higher you have to catch more fish between skill ups.
---
What are those islands west of Dun Morogh?
---
I didn't know that was an option. Thank you!!
---
&gt; unless you live for jerking off DPS charts.
---
Isn't that the point as a DPS? What else is there?
---
Draining is exactly how I’ve felt playing a warrior. I specifically picked it to tank and was excited to tank and then exactly as you said it feels like babysitting. Babysitting or doing a thankless job that I don’t feel accomplished from since it’s just fighting against idiot dps. 
---
I’ve re rolled Paladin so I could tank if I need to get a batch of quests done, but I can also heal which seems a bit less stressful. Or i can solo things because I’m not a warrior.
---
No? We were just having fun playing classic wow...this is what it's all about. Asmon raiding the server is what made it all happen...alliance formed some raids and stormed Orgrimmar...what's wrong with that? Was a great time.
---
The real fun of pvp servers is world pvp. It's really hard to organize on pve servers in a lot of cases, on a pvp server it's a way of life. The price  you pay is that you're going to deal with gankers from time to time and sometimes have to leave a zone entirely because of one bored level 60 rogue who no one on your faction want's to hunt down.
---
I like world pvp so I'm willing to pay that price.
---
Leather scraps
---
I have no room on my desk, but I may just hook up my second monitor instead of this
---
Yeah but he just killed an alliance.  This is war.
---
I use VanaKoS for that
---
now i could be wrong but i remember hearing from devs that those stupid flightpaths were becouse they wanted people to see different places and world itself. maybe to lure people check new places or enjoy the view
---
Today I killed 3 mobs on my shadow priest and didn't have to drink as I still had mana left. I had to log out because the tears of joy restricted my vision.
---
Even back when vanilla was current, I always felt like hunters should've used energy.
---
I’m going to try that!
---
Yes. Went pally heals. Now I get groups with no wasted time dealing with the cleave meta obsessed.
---

---
I now need to only bother to update WoW classic reddit 1 time in 24-48 hours by how extremely long shit stays on the front page.
---
Gj I guess, sub is half dead. And most of the front page stuff is not even classic related.
---
* Thunderclap: Only usable in B-stance, which is that one first time right after tank charges in.
---
* Sweeping Strikes: True tanks (Prot) cannot get this.
---
* Cleave: Again, Prot will not be cleaving because they cannot afford the rage, and with S&amp;B 1hander it's a completely inefficient use of what little rage they maintain. Sunder/Shield-Block/Revenge is where 90% of Prot's rage goes after the initial charge.
---
The warriors you see cleaving, sweeping striking, and spamming Thunderclap are not true tanks, they are Arms warriors strapping a shield on thinking they can main-tank a Raid. The true MTs will not be spamming any of this.
---
the lack of easy aoe threat is just killing my will to tank for any pugs, in guild groups I just keep the healer alive and they know that Im fury first and tank second.
---
I think theres an engineering or blacksmithing item that Grant's immunity to fear. Also engineering has really handy pvp tools. The gnomish death ray and net and a great combo. Also the shrink ray might work in your situation. Use it right before he fears and his attack power will (usually) go down dramatically.
---
No, they certainly do not on Herod. As much as I despise them, Storm controls the Devilsaur market.
---
You will have missed multiple shadow bolts by the time that 20 shadow damage has made up for the damage of a single shadow bolt. How is that more damage overall?
---
Arms and Fury warriors are still tanks outside of Endgame dungeons and raids.
---
Yea, I've discovered that vanilla tanking is less "keep 100% threat on everything" and more "keep threat on enough things that the group doesnt wipe"
---
He has the point, though. Depends of the situation, but if the group mentality is "go-go-go aoe all the shit down asap" I wouldn't be bothered to buff either. 
---
Because well, nobody's gonna wait for you to move together, that sucks.

---
Ehh don't agree with this one exactly.  Warriors are also one of the best DPS classes further into the content since they scale so well with gear.
---
I'm personally of the opinion of play what you want, but you better have the understanding of what you need to succeed in whatever are trying to play. DPS warriors rolling on shit that isnt even a direct upgrade for them and fucking tanks out of loot isnt cool. 
---
Also if you choose to play DPS warrior because you dont want or feel comfortable with that tanking responsibility you have no right to try to force someone else out of comfort zone or to shit on them if they do try and fail at it when it isnt their comfort role.
---
My general philosophy is that I'm going to get my tank to 60 and then use the tank to provide items and resources for all my other characters. Being able to get a dungeon any time of the day or night is a huge advantage, and I'll be able to funnel lowbie greens and resources to my other characters. Plus it makes eventually getting Thunderfury something that might actually happen. Once my warrior is hitting max I'll start my inevitable alt grind. Probably priest next (healers are easy to level and fun to play), then it'll be really hard to decide between hunter, rogue, and warlock.  
---
But yeah, having a 60 to feed your alts with is huge.
---
I don't think he switched. He and his crew just made horde characters and you can't have both on PVP servers so he had to join a new one.
---
You don’t really need a “shadow priest” for that, though, really. If you wanted shadow weaving that bad, you could have a healer priest just go far enough into shadow to get it, then have them spam rank 1 pain until it’s stacked and maintain it while healing.
---
they are simply judged on how many tickets they can close in an hour, with minimal amounts of complains or bad feedback from customers. Go to blizz website and find the email of their customer service, I would escalate this to a higher level of staff because these low level guys prob would be too scared to touch a 6 month ban in any case.
---
So nothing wrong.
---
The fact that he talks like he's done it successfully before is what gets me.
---
Theres a Picture in Picture extension that let's you pop out any video source by the way.
---
PvE servers are pretty chill for that style.
---
Adblock Plus sold out and started putting certain ad companies on a 'whitelist'. Use Ublock Origin, it doesn't have any such bullshit and blocks all ads.
---
Yes, and they give the real tanks a bad name.
---
I've leveled multiple 60s from 10-60 as Prot the whole way and I can't count the number of times I've had parties or merc guild-runs tell me the difference is outstanding. Strapping a shield on an Arms and calling that a tank post-Uldaman is lackluster at best, and dangerous at worst.
---
Pretty sure most DPS players do a hell of a lot of meth.
---
The server was fine before he crashed it with his legion of idiots. Fuck off.
---
It is quite pathetic for people to assume LC must work in only a very specific negative way.
---
No. Account transfers are only available if there is a queue, and they will choose what server for you to transfer to, likely a "new" server or a low pop server.
---
And not just the women... But the children...
---
Well if you strap a shield on as Arms instead of sticking with a two-hander, you're Arms Tanking wrong.
---
But...but...but... you're a warrior and you have shield and so you must tank or you're a lazy scumbag.
---
Dunno why you blurred out the moral of the story.
---
REEEEEEEEE.

I'd like to see a 24 hour cooldown personally.

This is some of the weirdest shit I've ever seen.   You have to really wonder what is happening in these people's real lives to make them this miserable and piteous.
---
As a mage, all I can say is yeah it costs mana and all but like in one bar of mana I can make enough water to trade a stack and still replenish my own mana. It’s not that inconvenient and it’s part of what our class has to offer a group. It’s the same as buffing. It speeds up the group. That said I do believe it you join a group you should have water on you already as not all groups have mages and it’s part of being prepared. But again it doesn’t excuse the stupidity of not handing out the thing you can make for free.
---
they say roll greed before a run. and roll need on boe items constantly so yes. there is many people who complain about them doing this.  three of his top ranked guilders got week long bans for ninja looting

Can someone explain to me why % chance to hit is so strong in classic? I'm playing hunter and when I look at bis lists I see it prioritized really heavily. I don't understand why getting 1% chance to hit on an item can be so good. In my head it sounds like a tiny damage increase.
---
10 guild's of trashy players ninja looting and not caring about outside guilds. its trashy and them moving servers proves they dont care about anyone else
---
The mythical Tauren rogue.
---
If they wanted players to have the info, then why not have it as default setting. 
---
Like some things i get like price of trash items. THats just lazyness. BUt to know what spell enemy is casting and for how long? thats op
---
Mage
---
To everyone who asks why we dislike Asmon so much, THIS IS FUCKING WHY
---
The community clearly said they didn't want to be a part of the streamer mess, the streamer community decided to all role on one server to be considerate to other people's preference, and Asmon server hops because he gets stream sniped and his shriveled bald boy cock needs to ruin other people's Classic experience to nake himself feel better.
---
Trash person.
---
Makes it better imo
---
This is absolutely correct, and the key difference. But here we are, full circle to the Shaman again. Have you seen how much squisher a 2H Arms is vs a Prot in his same place? It's a huge difference post Uldaman.
---
This is exactly the difference you see with Shaman: they focus on DPS instead of Shield Block +% and the other non-DPS talents, which makes them much squishier, which is where the whole conjecture comes from that Shaman cannot tank.
---
The majority of your group is not going to need the int buff anyway, it'll usually be yourself, the healer, and maybe one other person. Mage is a shitheel.
---
Yea if your not lvl 50 by the end of next week your gonna have a bad time.
---
TL:DR a bunch of friendly low levels did a dungeon the normal way.
---
Are they missing a flight path?
---
I ran Deadmines today as a level 13 priest for a party that was desperate for a healer. Not only did we make it, there were some scary moments that I helped them get out of successfully. It was a memorable experience for all involved.
---
Also I just want to mention, I'm loving my priest. They're a blonde human named Barbarella (that looks just like the film space heroine.) It really helps play up the whole adventure vibe for me
---
i only stopped giving out free fort buffs to random people in the world when it started costing 1/4 my mana bar :/
---
Let me guess yoy lost the chest to your wife by rolling a 100 to her 1? :D
---
Would it be more skillfull if he just lucked out and crit anyway? Its not like he posted calling it an outplay
---
Lol I like that analogy
---
Why would you think that? Just because the currently younger or unemployed crowd with the most hours reachs 60 first, doesnt mean their knowledge or mechanics are better than the 30 year old who has dedicated 4-12 hours a week for 15 years.
---
Classic is addicting, retail forces you to stay addicted.
---
No need to do it automatic. Usually whenever I enter a dungeon I already have 6 stacks in my inventory. Because I buy water from mages before I look for a group.
---
I have keybinded 67890 to my mouse buttons, 5 can still be more problematic in heat of the moment but I figured out I can just use "v" as a keybind, still a clusterfuck on a warrior with all the stance changes.
---
I enjoyed it. Thanks for posting.
---
Hey you should use will of the forsaken :) you alliance scum!!!
---

Make an emote: "And this... Is to go even further... Beyond!! Haaaàaaaaaaaaa AaaaaaaaaaaaHhhhhhhh!"

---
Really what members? becuase this is the first I have heard of it. Otherwise, you are just telling me hearsay. and Who are They say? One person? Royson? Yeah he didn't get banned.
---
He’s leading :)
---
Yes, otherwise if it’s a succubus the warlock can still seduce you even if you have stunlocked him
---
That's what I was wondering, I'll be honest I dont really want to raid but I really want to pvp. I might just level alts and step out till p3. I guess we'll see how getting a spot goes.
---
I would never assume someone knows what they're doing until they prove it
---
Well good that I asked (and got obligatory downvotes), because as far as I can see the picture linked doesn't make that obvious at all. And I don't spend all my time following Asmonbald to already know what this is about, sorry.
---
Except they couldn't. I don't think you understand how entrenched and effective Storm is, and I'm far more inclined to trust the abilities of a very old private server guild to whatever memelords Hades can summon. Also that entire guild is already basically blacklisted on Herod, so good luck making any sales.
---
Have you ever tried it?
---
Layers are already removed on most realms, check blueposts. Just a couple of weeks more and it should be gone on most realms if not all.
---
Wtf man cannibalism is off CD use it on him
---
MC encourages stacking 4+ warlocks for garr, which is a lot of warlocks that would like to get shadow weaving buffs.
---
MC also encourages stacking priests and pallies for dispell on probably half the fights. Horde only has one of these available to them.
---
MC has a fight where you need a purge, something only priests and shamans can provide. (When SPriests would normally be targeting the boss for instant purges anyways, vs other healers)
---
Fights in MC are usually 3 minutes long, something shadowpriests can handle without down ranking the majority of the encounter.
---

---
An Arms or Fury Warrior is still better at mitigating damage than a Tank-built Shaman, unfortunately.
---
Fuck that.
---
More like you ran into the mage that you copied because you couldn't accept that the name you wanted was taken. You are the imposter, he is the original.
---
Menethil Harbor -&gt; Thelsamar and Thelsamar -&gt; Menethil Harbor don't cost the same. And one of the ways is more expensive than going through IF instead.
---
Yeah, It seems like my "asshole" comment includes people who dont just randomly give out stuff in the open world, it wasnt meant to. Thats my bad. 
---
But I think Mage's should do it if someone politely asks, and they should definitely hand out food and water for Dungeon runs. I dont even understand how that isnt viewed as mandatory by some.
---
Yes classic is great for the lore especially because it's a slower pace it's normal to stop and see the roses, go fishing, and explore the old world Pre flying
---
Bruh these fake accounts are getting old
---
yeah i mean my point is more that, and frankly i don’t care how hard this is going to be downvoted, but #nochanges is going to kill this game. i’ve been playing wow since christmas of ‘05 and saw almost all of the content ever put in the game, and hindering the game so some fucking losers from ‘04 can relive the last time they were are happy is idiotic, diremaul and the itemization from phase 5 should already be out it would just make the game better.
---
^
---
Man, talk about petty.
---
And why would I give a shit about getting downvoted? Why would imaginary internet points mean shit to me when I should feel free to voice my opinion? That would make me a spineless little bitch. Like you probably. Does karma pay my bills? You think I care about the reddit game of trying to please everyone for good boy credit? Fuck off you twit.

In early legion you couldve stayed as actual steath tauren by going into cat form prowl then changing your talents thus forcing you to shape-shift out of catform but not the stealth
---
as a mage main this thread is a gold mine of advice for me for "what not to do"
---
We polled people about a week before Classic's launch regarding our meme removal policy. [You can see the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14LUJjOp-BOOPT1J0vid1Pf3MzUbYULs-kzYlL2lMrRY/edit#gid=150393122) although I'm working to format a nice graph to show it more obviously for future explanations.
---
58% of respondents said they had "no opinion / other," 24% said "just the right amount of moderation," 9% said "needs less moderation," and 6% said "needs stricter moderation." Another 2% said memes should be limited to 1 day a week, and 1% said they should be entirely banned.
---
Based on that survey with nearly 75,000 responses, we're staying the course. Even if you ignore the 58% that had no opinion, the top choice was still "right amount" and then "needs less moderation" was nearly tied with the cumulative responses of "needs stricter moderation" / "should be limited to one day a week" / "should be outright banned."
---
tl;dr: Only 9% of people wanted us to be looser on meme removal. We're siding with the 91% that were indifferent or wanted it to be the same/stricter.
---
Buffs can affect your group or anyone you cast it on. Debuffs affect the mob and anyone who attacks it (obviously this doesn't matter in dungeons, but in world pvp it can make a big difference). Including people from outside your party. It is affecting the mob itself, so it applies to everyone attacking it.
---
Yeah been playing some other games, hopefully that urge comes back before the next phase!
---
Yes!
---
When the game gets old and everyone has done naxx, what is there left. only pvp. being on a pve server then sucks.
---
The level 60 community, once it settles down, people start chatting. You might be able to hang with randos but the top tier players will learn your name and spread it around. We had a guy like that on Windrunner back in the day and he was such a toxic, ninja looting piece of shit that all the guild leaders got together and blanket banned him from all guild groups. He eventually either stopped playing or transferred off.
---
If you know you will be leveling multiple toons, it's best to use the rested XP to increase level speed. If you switch when they hit 150% rested (it caps at 1.5 levels worth) you can maximize xp gains and break the monotony of leveling 1 at a time. Also, it can prevent burnout.
---
If you are moving with just your left hand, use the cursors instead.  A and d strafe is a must.
---
I was just making sure he knew. People were freaking out lol
---
Alliance zones were built first. They ran out if time for the horde. That's why horde towns in the later zones are just randomly thrown off to the side and alliance towns are prominent
---
Get up there and kick his ass, stop being a cry baby.
---
Yeah and a ton of other mages here wrote how much they hate people not just trading them
---
It scales as you level, taking longer the higher level you are in fishing. The only factor I'm aware of is getting your level above the requirement to avoid fish getting away once caught. Other than that it just takes a lot of fishing :)
---
Oh yeah that was definitely happening with me. Also had a druid off tank. So that split damage taken a bit
---
Off the top of my head, everything happened with my warrior.  
---
Losing the roll for VanCleef's blade 99 to 100. 
---
Winning the roll for a pair of blue gloves 2 to 1. 
---
Killing a rogue and warrior combo 1v2 while doing the fire hardened armor quest in stonetalon.
---
He’s complaining about pvp happening on pvp servers on other threads and calling it bullying. So I think you might be on to something
---
Oh okay that makes sense thank you
---
It did what it was suppose to ...
---
Yeah I've got a few characters in the 20 range with full rested I can smash out a few levels on to get that ding feeling back.
---
the problem is that the recipe is...bop :(
---
yikes lmao
---
You have to be sure you have energy and a kick ready for the fear
---
Ambush, SS, kick fear, SS, cheap shot, vanish repeat
---
How does the character transfer thingy works? Do we have 1 free transfer per account? I've been kinda interested in playing PvP (currently playing PvE) but didn't wanted to create a character from scratch again.
---
Cry baby mode you mean 😂
---
A and d for turning is useless.  Bind yo strafe asap.  You'll get used to it
---
That's still only 1500 rep.
---
Wonder how many tries this took 😂🤔
---
For open world PvE and PvP Shadow is good.  
---
For raiding shadow is kind of a meme spec and really only one is brought along for shadow weaving to buff the warlocks for the most part.
---
The reward from the message quests was more than the flight cost
---
I actually agree.
---
I'm a Horde player, always will be, but Alliance zones just feel more "Colorful" is the correct word I believe.
---
Horde get to choose between bland deserts like Barrens/Thousand Needles while leveling early or Creepy Forest Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine.
---
Don't get me wrong I actually like Horde zones, but Alliance just feels better color-wise.
---
They get Elwynn forest to start in which is beautiful. Then Westfall for a good new diversity with a nice western theme, then they get spooky duskwood. They also get Darkshore which is it's own theme in itself, then Ashenvale for a "magical woods" kind of thing.
---
They also get a beautiful snowy zone, "Dun Morough" or however you spell it, then the other dwarf zone I can't pronounce either, and wetlands.
---
All their zones are different where as I feel Horde's aren't by much.
---
If you're 60 and don't have arcane brilliance by now you're doing it wrong anyway so...
---
Ummm it's "what, you're back?"
---
If people are taking Ret Paladins and Balance Druids and Shadow Priests, they shouldn't say jack to a Warrior who wants to 2h.
---
Oh man I need this for some people. My friend and I invited a lock to a dungeon group and he didn't have a weapon (at all. He said he disenchanted it because he didn't need one) and he never trained any of his pet skills and wanted to just have his blueberry out the whole dungeon.  He also then proceeded to start yelling at my friend (even though my friend hadn't actually said anything in chat, it was me) about how "this is how you're supposed to play classic" and "you've obviously never played vanilla".
---
It’s because they want you to see the world and become interested in exploring it. 
---
Maybe the FP takes someone  over an area they’ve never seen before and it inspires a player to keep on pushing forward to get to see that cool zone
---
Leatrix plus is the best fucking add on ever.
---
Do you have hit cap? i think its the best TPS wep out there.
---
Think about how you worded that “asking if someone else was underage means they wanted sex” part... underage for what? 🤔😳
---
Yeah alliance zones being more colorful and diverse is what gets me to like the game play more. After being in the dessert for 30 levels I kinda got burnt out
---
my opinion was that op is ridiculous for assuming that someone asking if they were underage makes them a pedophile. It was just a thought that I felt like expressing. And suddenly I'm being hit by a wave of triggered nerds. How am I in the wrong here?
---
Does it really matter if it's all the same information but moved/made to look different/neater if she's never played before?
---
I just respeced to holy/disc at 57 without life tap. Healing dungeons is a lot easier with holy/disc and I find that not having spirit tap isn't that big of a deal and I dont have to drink nearly as much while healing as I did while I was shadow. Solo leveling the kills are definitely slower, but not significantly and I have to drink more often.
---
Depends on the level of friend I think. Close friend? Of course, you're right. Work colleague/aqquantince? Go ahead and game.
---
Make a list of goals for the time that you play and try to knock them out. One that always gets me is stopping to talk to others in the world while questing, someone might ask for help or offer to help hell you might make a questing buddy. Been working pretty well for me but I'm on a rp server so people are pretty willing to speak to each other.
---
Oh didn’t see that. In that case, up to you if you want to take up tailoring. The robe will be profitable for quite a while so it might be worth it. Also, at 300 you can make 16 slot bags which will be in demand throughout classic.
---
This was not my general idea. I suggested stopping people from canceling lots when there is bid listed on them.
---
I tanked all the way to 60 and till I got full dps gear and swapped over, I wish I still needed gear so I could make other tanks happy by actually focusing the things they have aggro on and not going balls to the wall dps pre-pull and I actually understand that the warriors need to pull so they get rage to hold aggro.
---
I didnt know people like this existed lol. I thought this was a community of people helping each other
---
Really hate how streamers have made all these asshats decide to roll mages. It’s giving us all a bad rep and makes me really regret rolling one at launch.
---
That's so strange, I love it
---
Upvote for BB
---
I'm a lvl 51 mage and still using Red Mageweave Leggings (lvl 38 pants). What's a good upgrade, that isn't an expensive blue BOE that may not even be for sale? E.g. dungeons/quest reward/not too expensive craft.
---
Yes. I am a Russian.
---
Horde is for sure just a bunch of grown up edge lords with filthy rooms.
---
Only some servers allows transfers, and only to specific other servers. There is no way to transfer from a PVE server to a PVP sever and that will never happen.
---
Look at the pre-raid BIS lists for tanks
---
The thing these "just reroll and have fun, doesnt matter how many times you reroll lololol" dudes dont realize is that most people who do that do it because they have the *grass is always greener* syndrom. And they reroll because they get uncertain about their class choice. And on their 3rd alt they get disheartened when they feel like they are wasting time on deciding on a class. Especially if their friends are all 60 and in guilds that raid. They feel like they are missing out on the fun, and that again makes leveling even more of a chore.  
---
Just stick to a class. every class is fun at 60. Yes it looks like mages get all the perks, and we do. Except in raids where there are 11 of us and we never get loot. Every class has drawbacks. Just stick with one.
---
GOD for real! "Hold on we are going to rebuff."
---
"ALRIGHT LETS GOOOOOOOOO!"
---
"I SAID WAIT! I only buffed 3 of us!"
---
"I got my buff I'm going in..........WHERE ARE MY HEALS!!!!!!!!1!!!1!!!1!!11!!1?"
---
Found the North American who has never been to a beach in Europe.
---
Theramore to Ratchet: 16s
---
Ratchet to Theramore: 30s
---
Yup, seems about right
---
I was abused when i joined the group as the healer, was made to tank as another healer joined after, then rolled on a healing item.... you can't win as a druid.
---
I got a couple twats telling me to fuck off and come back later at the exiles, with no offer to do so
---
Shame on me for being there first and tagging ***their*** mobs
---
I'm not a rogue I don't understand, what's a pickle or whatever?
---
Haven't played it but have seen universal negative things from everyone, including people trying to play it.
---
Whatever!
---
What he/she said^
---
Why give them the opportunity to have a false positive with a program that can be used in a way that is bannable? This is on you. You use that program, you take the risk.
---
Bloodvine set gives another 3%, but that won't be out for ages!
---
That'd be more /r/gatesopencomeonin
---
This is what I wanted. 
---
Thanks!
---
It wouldn't, really. But what you're seeing in the picture is *not* the same information. There's like twice as much information as normal.
---
Two swing timers (despite her being a priest), damage meter, and all of whatever the fuck text is overlaid on her xp bar... It's quite a bit to take in, and the way its presented makes a lot of stuff that's not important to a new player look quite important
---
You're correct in that FPs are deliberate and the created them with purpose. They added doodads and landmarks for you to look at and keep you entertained during the huge time sink that is flight paths.
---
It is heal. If I were to leave my guild for example and I put in chat that I'm looking for a raidguild as a healer, I'd likely have 3-4 people instantly sending me messages. Our guild is also strapped for healers.
---
Meanwhile we have 3 tanks and dont need any more.
---
The reason for this is, there are more healers than tanks. So it isnt as easy to level a healer to 60. But you will need like 20% of your raid to be healers. Meanwhile you only need 5-10% to be tanks.
---
"find out which class you like the most and stick with it" ... Lol if we knew which class we liked the most we wouldn't be altoholics.
---
Ret is the levelling spec because you get command so early btw.
---
Right now it is, but in a stabilized economy 4 months from now it won't be.
---
I like the option to get into groups easier, but tbh most of my play time on vanilla will be solo and for maybe a couple hours. Also feel like I can do better defending myself on a warlock than I can a hunter. I'm really bad at pvp lol
---
I would say 70% of the reason I want to go back hunter is because of dm tribute runs being a good use of that small amount of solo time I have to play. I know warlocks can do the mara farm, but that's nothing compared to tribute runs or aoe'ing the lashes
---
At the end of the day I'll probably stick with lock, ty for the advice
---
What
---
Good bot
---
The droprate is under 2%
---
He screams "You just got MALOWNED" whenever he kills someone.
---
Made my guild laugh out quite loud when our shaman opened the 3rd mailbox, he spawned + oneshot him while yelling that. So 2005, and I love it.
---
I guess we better start thanking the tank for taunting, and the healer for healing, and the dps for dpsing while we are at it too.
---
Lol, of course I prefer a faster run to a slower run. Do you make such silly assumptions in your daily life? Well of course you do, you just did.
---
People can play however they want, but the "cleave meta" is only a problem in that (not surprisingly) most people are trash at a 15 year old game and cant figure out how to properly play the simple meta. People thought vanilla was hard, and it actually is, for people that just want to mash buttons instead of putting a tiny bit of thought into their class, abilities, and how to play the game.
---
You'd have to be one of these reddit dad gamers to want to enjoy the mulgore sunrise and spend 4 hours in WC.
---
Asmon built a toxic elitist community by being one of the best players on his realm late BC-MoP and uploading guide videos on youtube where he had a douchy attitude. After his youtube took off and he seemingly cared less about being good at the game and more about making content, however his toxic community still remains and shits on anyone who disagrees with Asmon.  
---
I think most of the hate for Asmon comes from how he deals with criticism. As soon as anyone criticise him, 99% of the time he will call the other party retarded. He also does the same a lot when people have the "wrong opinion" about completely subjective matters.  
---
I still watch his stream from time to time and enjoy it when he does big community events or his chat gets overly hyped from his guild killing a boss or getting loot, but in general he has some really shitty takes on a lot of things.
---
That’s fair, I was out at dinner while trying to remember values. But all the same, there are plenty of reasons that combat is just flat out better. If you happen to pull two mobs, ambush is flat out useless. Cheap shots two combo points plus 5 seconds of free damage on the mobs plus the extra white damage from swords are way more consistent with damage vs one mob. Adren rush makes harder quests wicked easy. Lower levels is way better as ambush, but 40+ especially with thrash blade is way better for every scenario, including most pvp engagements.
---
doesn't matter if it's ravager get or not, sweeping strikes + whirlwind is better aoe threat than any prot warrior has
---
47 all the times I’ve downed him.
---
As arms I struggle so bad to hold threat : (
---
Eh, it’s not necessary. It’s not difficult for a Warrior to skill up weapons by any stretch of the imagination.
---
This is cringe
---
fuck that place. getting quest runs for that spot on my server is near impossible because everyone wants to do exclusively princess or zombie runs.
---
They were right about having enough tanks, they were wrong about how fucking lazy most people playing warriors are and refuse to slap on a shield. Just an FYI, fury is perfectly fine at tanking a 5 man.
---
Its not against the ToS. Devilsaut mafia is not runing or ruining the server. Stupid boomers. Fucking reddit man. Just fking play the game who cares.
---
Leveling alts is fun tho. Plus, playing different classes to 20ish+ may benefit players by choosing a proper main for 60
---
No, you're right. They also didn't want people to be able to get from place to place super fast. The devs felt this would ruin the immersion and make the game feel smaller.
---
Sup Chad.
---
What do you think about what I said about tribute runs in my reply to the other guy? Would like to hear your opinion as well
---
Ty
---
The honeymoon will eventually end.
---
I still need to get the rep to finish pathfinder cant do it
---
Why is it a mistake? People are just playing the game my dude.
---
As a first time WoW player, I can confirm that flying over the burning steppes on my way to iron forge the first time, my first reaction was “holy crap, I can’t wait to be walking around a place as cool as that!”
---
I'd agree with this. I leveled a Druid to ~40 and then rerolled a Warlock. Went to a few others until I picked back up my Druid and never looked back.
---
There's a point in each class that I'd call a peak before a lull. Get past the lull and it's smooth sailing.
---
Ainyome from horde anathema?
---
For Ony you must be attuned to get in. For molten core it allows you to take the shortcut to get into the instance. You do not have to be attuned to get into molten core but if you aren't you have to run through BRD to get to the entrance.
---
Same. Mage should offer water as a perk for the group. As heals if my mage is a douche and steps on his own dick I will convienently forget to heal them. In OP situation I would have loved to say "go buy some" in response to a mages(or anyone)"where were the heals".
---
you dont have to say please for heals, you dont have to say please for prayer of fortitude. if you are a mage, you owe your group every part of your kit towards making a success
---
This is the correct answer. Also be ready to pull aggro and die a lot while you're learning. Your biggest problem will be pumping out too much threat from all the damage  you're doing.
---
All AddOns give an advantage to people who use them over people who don't.
---
They're called "AddOns" not "TakeAways".
---
And a line to claim Felix's Bucket of Bolts.
---
“On which [server]? be a bit more helpful”
---
Not ganna lie I use picture in picture sometimes too even with 2 monitors, I can't stop myself from browsing reddit while I watch something so at least I get to keep watching my show.
---
Possible I guess. I was addicted in vanilla and skipped out on hanging with my friends quite a bit, I never wanted to go outside. Became a little awkward and missed a lot of fun because of it. Fast forward and I still play, but never skip an opportunity to go hang out with people/girls. Hasn’t failed me.
---
I agree with you. I don’t think what Asmongold did was “cool” and or funny but at the end of the day it was just content for his viewers. It’s an online game and I think people fucking around and “trolling” is inevitable. I didn’t get as mad as others about this situation but I do understand their frustration.
---
Everyone's just gonna call you shin on voice chat anyway.
---
Yeah you could totally cleave your way throught MgT, but then again that was at the end, and of course they nerfed it. Pre nerf heroic MgT legit required 3 CCs per pull or you weren't even making it past the first pack.
---
Wrath...was all AoE...
---
I report them.  Right click on their name in the invite and the menu should drop down.  If not, just send them a whisper and there name will be reportable there.
---
Thanks, I was getting tired of the warrior at 41. This rational regardless of whether or not its right is what ima cling to.
---
If so, he's winning lol.
---
I never claimed it was against the tos, or that it is ruining the server. I simply answered your question ”whats wrong with it”. Not my fault you dont like the answer.
---
I have a 33, 23, 21, 19, and various 15s, lol.  I’m not doing it because I become disenchanted with the classes, it’s because I love them all (except warriors and rogues).  I have truly missed how each class played in Vanilla so I want to level them all, other than the above mentioned exceptions.  And I don’t care if I ever raid again.  What’s wrong with that?
---
It's worse now than it was even back at vanilla release. Back then everybody was either coming from other mmos or a completely new player. They either knew how things worked or hadn't developed bad habits yet. Now there are a ton of people from retail who have a host of terrible habits and attitudes that don't work in classic. I love tanking so much but sometimes I don't bother looking for a group because it's not worth the potential frustration. It's mentally exhausting fighting your group and the mobs at the same time.
---
The buffs and debuffs you see on the enemy unit frame (like sunder armor or demo shout) effect the enemy. So everyone attacking this enemy profits from that.
---
The buffs and debuffs you see on your unit frame effect only you, so only you profit from that. Some buffs like shouts though buff everyone around you (I believe it's 20 yards) as well. Other buffs like arcane intellect from mages last longer but have to be cast on every single player separately
---
now we need for, while and dowhile
---
Thinks there s a dude that has that recipe in stonetalon pretty often. They dont sell for much

The mods are trash.

Paging u/soupa****
---
I had 50g at level 40. Pickpocketed sm library for 1 day and I had 90g
---
Radiation is not a poison
---
I also have more than one hunter because I like leveling hunters.  They are different races though.
---
Wow, on Shazzrah they are 17 gold per leather.
---
Yeah you're right, I assumed it was a warrior or something in which case the swing timer would be useful but maybe too overwhelming for a new player and the damage meter isn't needed at all. 
---
I've still seen people say that peoples ui's look cluttered just because they've simply moved health bars towards the middle and moved the action bars into one group though.
---
So essentially the best weapons I can get as a Human Warrior are going to be swords, correct?
---
It is because you can be sure there is some weird shit going on almost constantly. A lot of people like that.
---
Yes and noone carries that shit on them. Idiot
---
Same dilemma
---
&gt;Yes, but why do you think private server people would suddenly be making some paradigm shift to write for a retail game/community they don't play? 
---
Because they have financial incentive to do so?  They're either being paid by Wowhead directly to create the content, or Wowhead is funnelling people to the content creators' Twitch/YouTube channels, or both.
---
&gt;That makes zero sense as it's not even something they'd have as much experience with in the first place.
---
Which is why the content creators dumb down the guides to make sense to newer players or retail players who didn't play vanilla.
---
&gt;Many of the guides even go out of their way to point out differences between classic and retail leveling, insofar as classic taking significantly longer, different dungeon paradigms, and so on. 
---
More evidence of the specific guide to which the audience is targeted, thank you.
---
&gt;Your conspiracy theory is nonsensical.
---
If you're a mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging, perpetual contrarian, sure.
---
I was around 28 helping a level 16 Alliance player kill quest mobs in Redridge.  I had just tamed a boar and was trying to learn charge off it.
---
Things were going great until some 22 NE hunter just started shooting me ... then the person I was helping was attacking me too.
---
/sigh
---
/shrug
---
And I killed them both and went on with trying to learn charge.
---
Got my BiS crossbow finally and went to train its weapons kill up on those invincible mobs in the badlands. 1 to 299 skill took a little over an hour but nown it has been 299 for about the same amount of time. Is this a bug? I don't recall raising my bow to 300 taking nearly this long.
---
Pull while they drink, even if they bitch about it - it will give you time to get sunders up. Always keep threat on elites over normal mobs in strat live. The normal mobs die fast enough to where it shouldn't be an issue.
---
Considering that most people blindly follow wowclassicbis.com which flat out recommends going for full Defense gear, you'll fall on deaf ears here I reckon.
---
I see so many Warriors in full Deathbone armor and I can only imagine their threatgen and actual tankyness. *But hey, they're not getting crit!*
---
For those uninitiated: Defense is literally a bad stat mathematically and only required for bosses that *will* kill you unless you're defcapped - which is 0 until Naxx and depending on balancing *maybe* BWL and AQ (Broodlord MS shouldn't be able to crit since we're past 1.8 e.g). Most of a Bosses' big boy damage comes from spells, like Ony's breath, Rag's special attack, and that stuff's magical. 
---
On top of that, Shield Block prevents crits from occuring, is up every 5 seconds for 2 hits and most bosses swing every ~2 seconds, meaning that even on heavier hitting bosses, using an already great defensive tool - Shield Block that is - makes you crit immune with some dodge, parry and blockgear, too.
---
Do your guild a favor: Abandon that "I NEED TO BE CRITCAPPED" meta. It's out of date, not even logical if played well and your threat output will be *awful*. You can still be tanky, but aim for decent Mitigationstats: Stamina, Parry, Dodge, Armor, Agility, stuff like that.
---
Its a bad day to be an ale, aye
---
I LOLd at them looting while three mobs are wailing on you!!  Happens all the time doesn’t it?  ROFL
---
You don’t need any boes to get 60 easily. Any gold spent on them is a waste of money. Your mount will increase your leveling speed 1000x more than any boe would.
---
Because twitch streamers and YouTube videos assured them that mage is the best at leveling
---
I'm conflicted now.
---
Yea it was just loot council, and maybe I'm just in one of those guilds thats just going to be a bad experience for anyone not in the GM's streamer's inner circle. It really felt like the mannerisms of how it was being done that mostly maybe feel like something was off, especially with people getting multiple major drops on the first guild run where a lot of the members like me struggled through the first few weeks of pugging it. (there was someone who got Core Hound Tooth and a Rag drop)
---
This is buzzfeed we’re talking about. Curly hair on a white person is racist.
---
I make a full stack right when I log in. If I'm going to do a dungeon, I start making another stack for the healer.  DPS will usually get a rank behind, they don't usually need the highest ranked water.  If it's a harder dungeon, or it's taking awhile to get the group, I slowly start making more as I go about my business and let natural mana regen replenish between casts.
---
This is all MUCH better than my warlock prepping for raid... Soul shard farming can GDIAF. I hated that so much back in the day, no way was I gonna raid on a lock again in Classic.
---
If it's not elite, you don't give two shits about tanking it if they aoe on the spot. Also tclap is AWFUL.
---
I never said it failed. What I was implying was that it’s existence was a mistake
---
Fair warning you'll only be doing big hits like this every 30 minutes for 15 seconds
---
I mean from what I understand thats true, being that they can AOE grind for days. Still doesnt explain the toxicity.
---
Community
---
I personally love druid tanking. That warlock life tapping to 1 health everyone is complaining about? Free healing threat for me. Solo leveling is a breeze. Best move speed at level 21 and 30, underwater quests are easy. You just have so much available to you.
---
I must have the worst luck in the world because I hardly ever see people LF tanks and I play one. I’m only lev 40 tho
---
Asmongold Dereangment Syndrom.
---
Jesus christ what part of this happens to BOTH factions don't you get
---
I could go record a days worth of STV and shockingly to your suprise horde and alliance both die to high level players.
---
GASP Ikr?
---
I'm getting a different experience. I'm basically the only horde everywhere I go. Layers is messing with this. If you wanna see bad, look at stalagg.
---
You'd see that in the combat log if you were watching it anyway, though.
---
You'll be fine. Click on the tank and the click on the button to assist target (usually F if memory serves). Then just focus your fire on that target. Sometimes you'll see shapes pop up over people's heads, if you don't know what they mean ask. Usually anything other than skull (which is the primary kill target) means some form of crowd control, which you don't want to break.  
---
Other than that, don't pull mobs, watch for patrols, and don't need roll unless it's a real upgrade (when in doubt, ask what the party thinks).
---
Yeah i should've been more clear. I'll edit.
---
Level 10.
---
indeed! although purple one also looks cool imo
---
It's guaranteed damage as long as it hits. If everything is on CD, use it. you'll stop using it later though because it doesn't.. exactly scale very well.
---
Windstreams man
---
You’re on the internet. Get over it.
---
And never get tank gear
---
He says "huh, I'm a cat" but OK buddy
---
It's fury till 40, arms till 58, prot till you have enough gear to go fury/prot.
---
FYI, it's easier to tank while levelling as fury, and until you have access to mortal strike there's a LOT less bonus in arms than you'd htink. Seriously, the extra rage generated on attacks + cheaper cleave is just so great for tanking while levelling.
---
If you don't name him then how will I know which layer to ask for?
---
Nah, they're a new player that aoe farmed to 60 in less than 100 hours like Joker did. You know, like all those other new players who are able to power-grind and hit leveling records.
---
Come to Heartseeker, fellow Alliance!
---
Raids, yes, absolutely I agree. If you wan't fucking water, trade. I ain't finding your ass outta 40 people.
---
5 mans though? I'll ask for water and let the mage trade me when hes done.
---
I've never healed in a raid before, but I heal a lot of dungeons. I almost never look at the tank model directly, usually I'm just monitoring their HP on the unitframe and thats what I click to target and heal him, I NEVER click the player model.  So I really don't think thats an issue, my dude.
---
Why, it looks horrible lol
---
A a 43 priest I only ever used PSW maybe 3 or 4 times as an oh shit I wasnt paying attention thing. Doesnt seem very mana efficient. Maybe that will change later in the game though.
---
Oh, no. It's definitely an advantage to those who use the addon. I'm not going to argue it isn't. But that's true of a lot of addons. DBM, for example, is an almost essential raiding addon (though less so in retail today) for a lot of very good reasons.
---
Lots of addons have bordered on "cheating" for the entirety of the game's life, this one is no different. Blizzard clearly doesn't see it as too big of an issue though because addons like this have existed for a solid 13 years now, they've demonstrated in the past their willingness to break the functionality of addons that step over the line. I don't remember the addon's name but there was something in Wrath that had the ability to draw threat zones and other various things such as estimated player locations on the screen in 3D, Blizzard killed that hard. 
---
I wouldn't shed a tear if Blizz decided to off Spy, but for now I figure it's best people at least know it exists. I'm not of the camp that we shouldn't be telling people about it because people are going to use it anyway, might as well level the playing field. As someone else said though, it only provides one or two major advantages over someone just keeping an eye on their combat log.
---
The streamer with a maga hat in the background is a toxic asshole, more news at 11
---
Druid tank is the best tank now because of tps and they’re very viable throughout the entire game.
---
A lot of what everyone already said is perfect.
---
Couple extras;
---
I want to emphasize the frequent use of demo shout. It's great for keeping the mobs on you during the initial pull. I'll cast it once as my first or second move, but then I'll cast it a few more times after a couple Sunders go out on the first and/or second target depending on healer or AOE aggro situation.
---
Make sure to get a gun or bow and do the ranged-pulls yourself. The initial rage generation from taking all those first few hits is crucial. It's easy to tank when you're swimming in rage, but near impossible of you're starving for it. 
---
If you're arms, go for tactical mastery and look into macros that allow you to switch stances and cast an ability at the same time. I.e., if taunt is on CD, you can switch to battle stance a quick mocking blow when things get spicy. Also when you're not tanking, you can switch to def stance for a disarm, etc, or trip battle stance for an overpower.
---
Also save bloodrage to line up with the initial pull whenever possible. It's the most crucial part of most fights.
---
Good luck out there!
---
I kinda just wanna try tanking out, I came from ESO and enjoyed tanking there, and from what I understand tanking is pretty different between the two. The main thing thats stopping me is that I hear warriors are the go-to tank class and that they are absurdly tedious/difficult/annoying to level in classic.
---
I know of a few ways to abruptly end a party
---
Terrible mod. Everyone rating each other like we are restaurants on yelp? You want a rating based system that is not monitored for accuracy? This is how classic gets ruined.
---
Soon its, LFM ubrs - min 80 player score pst
---
Gear score all over, except worse.
---
Keep death coil in mind; this is a 500+ damage insta cast 3 second unbreakable fear.
---
As a lock my response to a rogue opener will be to death coil then instantly cast a fear. If they’re not UD this pretty much guarantees a win. 
---
So I’d say your best bet is to kill them without giving them a chance to click any buttons or don’t bother at all.
---
As I said, I heal them just not as much.
---
"I'm not being aggressive,  I'm being dominant "
---
You should try talking to them one day and asking them.
---
QQ
---
Literally the cringiest thing I've ever seen holy shit.
---
That's only if you find rogues who don't know how to blind/gouge.
---
No, heroic strike is static on top of your dps. Shield slam is in addition to your normal white strike while still being relatively static. Overall you're comparing white hit + shield slam vs just heroic strike. It's not even close.
---
What brings you to the classic subreddit?
---
Just checking, lol. Seen so many people roll need on that and healing power gear without realizing. Big bonus that it looks awesome though!
---
Undead or Orc will always have an edge on any other choice pvp wise. There is no comparing them.
---
PvE wise no racial is strong enough to really matter that much.
---
Thought I was in r/oaklandraiders after seeing this
---
Yes, all the time. mocking blow, zerker rage(did you know you generate more rage while getting hit?). If you have enough pts to stance swap to WW and other such it's great for lower level content you might be helping people through. Without swapping to bstance you can't thunderclap for the debuff either.
---
Well there’s only two layers left so odds are it will effect you regardless.
---
Then how do you get him with those two golems then?
---
lol ain't this the fuckin truth, spent 2 hours yesterday just running around to open a few flight paths. Had a lot of fun running the gold road on a pvp server as alliance though. Didn't even get ganked so that was nice. Had some close encounters but all with lowbies who were busy leveling.
---
You could have spent that one day leveling to 45 and you probably would have had 90g and lvl 45.
---
Undead. Better priest skills and their racial activation is too good
---
Kept us going for 6 years so far!
---
Faps don't stop fear
---
Typing in “reeee” as an adult in 2019
---
If dps are doing their job correctly they're generally threat capped. You /will/ generate less rage currently than a prot tank so you'll lower a lot of raid dps.
---
Also look up Shandris Feathermoon Orgrimmar. Good stuff.
---
Don't just ignore them, report them for spam.
---
Ok, thats an argument. The guy was max level tho.
---
Keep yer stick on the ice
---
Yeah our GM said if we get that we can’t roll on mageblade so everybody gets gear. Everybody rolled anyways, congrats!
---
The salt towards my guildies that quit bfa in the middle of the raid tier.
---
Imagine not having fun with the name you choose for a game.
---
Make sure to only use abilities that say they're high threat. And nothing else. Don't waste rage on something that isn't going to generate threat.
---
It did for me, I probably made 30-40g just pickpocketing and vendoring stuff. To the point where I had 150g by the time I had hit 40. I have around 60 now @ lvl 41. Pickpocket dungeons where the mobs are grey (SM lib) and go wild. Also only do that in sub, double vanish + speed and less detection are crucial
---
Some serious thug life shit
---
How is that comment showing any kind of power trip? That's not how proving points work.
---
So it's not in the ToS, and GM's have said it's not against the rules. Don't hold your breath.
---
Ok just stay with me.
---
The India Pale Ale was named that because it was the first ale capable of staying fresh for the entire journey from England to India.  Who was traveling to Ironforge that needed a pale ale with that kind of preserves?
---
Might be a joke but idk
---
That's because the chance on hit extra rage gen is static %. Works the same PER HITl if your weapon is 50000000speed or .1 speed. If you get a heck ton more attacks, heeck ton more rage from that talent.
---
Even 300 lockpick fails on strat door occasionally. No idea about the other one, could be gnomer?
---
As a lock you should prefer food
---
Immersion is much greater when you have your camera close to your character. Some people play this game to have fun.
---
Just hit level 40 on my dwarf priest, got my mount and I am now broke, should I respec out of wand spec and into shadow form? Can't afford my new spell ranks yet.
---
What dungs should I be running?
---
you usually only give it too the healers. saying that every single person deserves shit loads of free water is a bit entitled.
---
sure if they ask, you give it too em...but too simply say that the mage is supposed to have 90+ water made right of the bat is insane.
---
imagine you just hit 40, and you got the new water. now imagine making 90 of em PLUS what you need. (and alot of people will refuse the lower tier water if your 40+)
---
i give 1 stack to each person who needs it. and i make more as its needed.
---
Oh man please don't tell my wife I don't think she knows my real age
---
I have a feud with John too. Going all the way back to when I was 38 and he was a 44. Got me once, but my friend and I camped him until he took a spirit res.
---
So these guilds are disrupting player experience by doing what they're doing which is against ToS and GMs have said they will be looking into it. 
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
Im amazed by the amount of hunters that dont know cheetah doesnt daze from dot dmg. Stun your ganked and cheetah away my bro.
---
I never get fed up with tips. But I won't cast a portal until they tip something. Even 5s. I'm level 60 with an epic mount tho so mainly using gold for consumables
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Nah, guild run. There's ongoing debate about whether to adopt a loot council or DKP, so while that plays out we're playing by loose round robin rules.
---
Nope
---
Well you can say he's never gunna give you up.
---
Never gunna let you down. Never gunna run around, and desert you.
---
not from me, ive never sold water. and i have no intention of doing it.i give water in dungeons not in the base game. i dont have the patients to meet the demand.
---
FUS RODA
---
Too bad those chests had a combined 7 cloth, 43 copper, and two vendor BoE’s
---
[Miss! Miiiisssss!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whAQ18pz7G0)
---
This comment has layers and I love all of them.
---
&gt; Remember, you can play whatever you want and do whatever you want.
---
You can play whatever you want, but don't expect all classes and specs to have an equally easy time finding groups to raid with
---
/target x  
---
/trade
---
So I just hit 300 enchanting through a long slow grind while leveling.  My advice is to ignore the enchants and just level up to 60. You can disenchant greens along the way, or anything where the value of disenchant mats is higher than the vendor price (Some add-on tracks this). When you hit 60 you can grind gold and greens way faster than you did at low levels, buy all the formulas from vendors, solo the backdoor at Uldeman to get to the artisan enchanter trainer, etc. Just a lot of time saved.
---
Which enchant is the best to go for with the WW axe for pure ownage? Fiery? Crusader? +7? ...?
---
i remember that guild :) the or the name atleast.
---
He is referring to the schematic for Goblin Jumper Cables XL which comes from BRD specifically.
---
Doesnt happen much.  Maybe 5 times to ne with 8 days played.  Way better than before.
---
I am so confused by this conversation... at least scribble the names out in color to know who’s who...
---
Ur talking like asmon and the players in his guild has some sort of skill..
---
You don't have enough gear for the second build to really matter fyi. If you are a random offtank, just go with a normal dps build. If you are one of the 2 tanks that are NORMALLY tanking, then you start looking at prot.
---
Should be.
---
Probably a bad idea, as I'm shit at the game, given that classic is the first I've played and my character is level 19
---
Dude people can be mean online.  This isn’t new.
---
 It sucks but sometimes you just gotta get over it.
---
Git Gud
---
Do a Barael roll!
---
Then why are warriors dropping their shields for dual-wielding, so they can build more threat? Wasn't the hole argument against bear tanks that they can't block?
---
There is a potion that removes 1 magic effect on you every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. You can use it to remove fear after it is cast on you.
---
Undead for solo leveling/activities, troll for group leveling/activities.
---
Did this with my brother. Got to Ruth'aran about a minute and a half ahead of him, leaving from the south, taking the straight route.
---
Time is money, friend!
---
None ever said you can't clear raids with 5 ret paladins a prot paladin with a feral offtank 10 boomkins and 3 enhancement shamans for nightfall procs, it's just that people don't want to. Also it's fucking MC what did you expect?
---
1k Needles?
---
Horde pvp at its finest TBH.
---
Do you know what any decent Priest does upon enter a dungeon? Runs around and clicks on healthbars until everyone has Fortitude. 
---
Do you know what a Paladin does upon entering a dungeon? Runs around and clicks on healthbars until everyone has a Blessing.
---
Supplying water/food should be viewed in the exact same way, while it's nice to receive a "thank you" or request it's expected in the first place.
---
As a Human *le fun*
---
the dagger from sm
---
Getting a group together to run ST together let alone a group that knows what they’re doing and understand the puzzles and mechanics is a 4 hours process in of itself.
---
I mean I only see Horde strolling in with 40 man raids to kill one guy so...
---
Prot is only needed for raiding. The need for a board comes from how good the party members are and how good are their gear. If you are starting and playing with random guys go for the board, better safe than sorry, once you get experienced you will feel when wielding a 2h is safe. I did all the way to 60 as Arms and tanked all dungeons, 20 minutes before first raid I respec to Fury, still at tank duty in dungeons though. People parrot too much rules without knowing what they talking about. You only have problems if you raiding seriously and PvPing seriously, that would probably require you to switch specs often.
---
Our guilds healer druid probably has the most epics on the server :) (Last Eu realm that was made)
---
Why would a slower speed ever be better? If both weapons do 50 dmg, why would you choose one that swings once per second over one that swings once every two seconds?
---
Honest question, I’m new to WoW.
---
I just don’t think it makes sense for something with a higher “speed” to be slower. This car drives as a higher speed than that, it’s faster. This weapon speed is higher than that - intuitively you’d think it attacks faster.
---
“Delay” makes more sense to me if they want to measure the time between speeds. Personally, I’d just do attacks per second and call that speed, so one attack every 2 seconds is 0.50 speed.
---
How is it uninspiring?
---
This sub is really terrible man.
---
Yes, this depends on the guild. Usually these tanks are already well-geared with windfury, their guild is probably busy on AQ40 or Naxx, at least BWL. Also, I said they were borrowed for ZQ/AQ20 which resets twice a week, so it's not a big deal.
---
Thanks yeah that's all I was saying.
---
Haha so much for dungeon finder then...it ruined WoW...all hail Classic
---
Hi Tarhiel! I just saw Tarhiel, gurl.
---
Nope still a fair few actually! Just started yesterday.
---
I...don't think that's how Steamwheedle Guards work.
---
If they can drop it you can pick pocket it. I think their pockets refill after like 10-15 min too
---
If you can handle going to war overseas you can handle some prick online... idk why you’re posting about this.  Move on mate
---
Thanks for helping clear that up! Super unintuitive that a higher “speed” means slower attacks imo, but good to know.
---
Ah yes, the Charles Manson defense.
---
Don’t leak secret Pat Pvp Strategies!!
---
The ones he kicked?
---
Beat me to it
---
Alliance is better in PvE. I personally only play horde because I really wanted to play a Shaman.
---
After being called a F@##OT for not accepting a guy to a ZF run, I advised his guild leader of his actions and asked "is that how you want your guild to be portrayed?" The guild leader told me "oh yeah." I told him this behavior is horrible and shouldnt be tolerated in which he replied to the text in the above picture. "arent you some fat disabled vet?"
---
im a guy that branded himself as a troll, its what i do and i have a thick skin. im not triggered or mad, but i am concerned because classic WoW is about camaraderie and working together. although my line is very far away, this guy crossed it. disgusting.
---
Even as arms you should still be in defensive stance most of the time, using sunder and revenge to hold aggro. Dancing into battle stance for sweeping strikes and berserker stance for ww/berserker rage is something you'll want to be doing as well, but you should be spending most of your time in defensive stance.
---
It was for me. I'm stacking strength, skipped Feral Charge for more Shred damage, but guess what I get to do in dungeons 90% of the time?
---
No.
---
Just having it press a button repeatedly with one button press is enough to get banned.
---
In his defense, once you give all of your free water away, and spend all of your mana on it buffs, you end up spending the first 5 pulls completely out of mana because you just hit level 45 and can only make water 2 stacks ata time.
---
Invite pls. I give underwater breathing then lifetap until the healer is oom.
---
mage AOE farming has been the meta since before even private servers though. I mean maybe you can point to Ziqo and Ruki aoe farming during the beta in SM but still i mean this is stuff thats been around. I think mixing AOE farming into normal groups that aren't equipped to deal with it IS a problem we have to face and deal with but I do not thinking blaming ziqo and joker for this stuff is reasonable at all
---
There's a guy on Herod Alliance with it and since he is the only one he charges a 200g tip ontop of cost for mats.
---
Calm down hun
---
Seriously what a snowflake.
---
I feel u, im 400 gold from epic and my only income is vendoring from owlbeasts in wspring and dungeon loot.
---
sorry this happened :(
---
Oh it’s just as Grindy if you want xp but it’s always a lot more places to farm and Stuff. Just depends on what u do
---
Imagine thinking that is a fun name. Sad.
---
More horde on PVP servers, so you guys do it more. You bad at math?
---
I feel ya
---
Nah it’s not that. It was a more comprehensive thing I had to do. If you recently updated windows it is almost certainly the case.
---
I'm down for anything. Imo they could even give real ingame rewards for playing the behind faction. Give em more gold/exp.  Have em get more honor.
---
I was gonna say be more specific. but literally every part of 1k has rocks like this lol
---
Arathi?
---
I think it looks badass, guess it's a personal preference thing.
---
Low pop server? I've had no issues finding groups for full ZF/mara runs, maybe it's because I never need to find a tank tho.
---
Classic wow isnt about anything. You need to buck up and ignore people. That's why they have the ignore button. Your line isnt that fucking far out if this bugs you.
---
lol im not a snowflake. check the post hx. i fuck with crybaby snowflakes all day. but keyboard pussies like this need to be called out.
---
thats a huge EH from me. I lean more on the side of keeping blizzard out of this kinda stuff. On a pvp server you should be ready to deal with this, which would mean forming your own mafia. Make some friends with the opposite faction, there's TWO sides that hate the mafia just as there's two sides of the mafia. I know it sort of is a "become what you hate" thing but really as long as you can think slightly deeply about anything you would see that it's not that at all
---
Looks like it's just outside Freewind Post.
---
I legit use a bag slot for a grey item [Rabbit's Foot].  I swear by it.
---
Well I'm Alliance, and likely not on your server...
---
Ah yes, that one rock protruding out of that one large plateau in that one spot.
---
Undead. Imo devouring plague is absolutely sick to deploy and makes soloing quest mobs with guards so easy.
---
I think you need to rethink who the pussy is here.
---
I have Beast Mastery up to bestial wrath and Marksmanship up until aimed shot. I think I have 8 points left before 60, should I go towards mortal shots or go for monster &amp; humanoid slaying in Survival?
---
Eh no they don't. None of us care. Ignore them and move on.
---
A post with zero context that only the op found funny.

I prefer Spiteflayer, a vulture that is the fastest bird in the game with a 1.2 attack speed. She can use bite, claw AND screech, with decent armor and health. DPS is a bit lower than cat and owl but vs owl the faster attack speed helps compensate. She’s a beast!

I couldn't tell you, but you should join KK's Discord, he has replied me everytime I asked something within minutes: https://discord.gg/YUmxqQm

this is indeed correct.

No cap

Seriously.
---
Thanks. I'll remove tclap from the pull rotation.
---
It’s not that it hasn’t been around. It’s that thousands of people trying the game for the first time saw these people doing it and how effective it was and wanted to do it themselves. It’s not bad in itself, it’s just that the more people on any given class the more likely you are to run into complete dickheads. If jokerd had been a Druid and got world first somehow still I’d wager we’d see the same result with that class.

Real talk.

Can we not send things cross server? that's a shame :&lt;

Well if I am polite at the beginning of a group and they refuse to give people water, then yeah.  Probably not me.  I guess I could just not give out buffs right?

A warlock killed me after I was fighting two mobs in 1k needles despite me passing by them 3 minutes prior and doing nothing. I proceeded to camp them for 30 minutes until they spirit resed and disappeared. Don’t be a dick or else it may end badly for you.

Axe from SM would be good at that level

It's a server. PvP Eastern time zone. Alliance heavy. The average among all the random numbers I see thrown out seem to be about 65/35 Alliance to Horde.

And if they allow themselves to offer us mortals some of their godpower-infused H2O, they are fucking stingy with food.  
---
Dont get me wrong, it may be annoying for a whole Party to ask you for food and water. But screw any mage who is stingy as fuck with buffs, food or water. I used to play Mage in classic 15 years ago.  
---
I always went through the trouble of making the best water for my group, despite only conjuring 4 or 6 per cast. Nowadays mages cant be arsed to even do that. Highest level water and food, that they can produce a stack of with one cast. Then they wonder why everyone regs so slow. This time I rolled warlock, because I remembered spending half an hour conjuring water and food pre-raid, so I had an easier time handing it out. Its too hard for any mage to hand me 2 stacks water or 2 stacks food. They end up giving me 2 stacks of water and  one and a half food. Some just give me the spare-bread they had in their bag. 14 Food, 40 Water. 26 Food, 40 Water. 40 Food, 60 Water.   
---
You guess it, I'm getting tired of all these lazy ass mages.
---
What? Game is literally about alliance vs horde, thinking it should be allowed to work together like this is straight up dumb.
---
Never forget the work we did today!  Tell your children’s children
---
Btw, other faction can't see custom /e, if that's what you did.
---
Lol did that, too.. some mage came in and tried to steal the kill. They got shamed and /spit on until they took their place in the back of the line. 
---
It was pretty cool. You see screenshots of alliance lining up for that *one* quest item/kill and being civil all the time. Never see stuff like that horde side. We’re all every man for hisself.
---
Is it though? You can do that with almost every gaming keyboard. Pretty sure it’s intelligent actions blizzard is concerned about.
---
Pallies are better at single-target healing than priest. They have a talent that gives 100% mana refund when a heal crits. That allows them to heal continuously and never run out of mana. Usually a pally and a druid are assigned to keep the MT alive. Maybe they could do tanking or DPS, but what about the gear? A normal guild will give those good gears to other classes first, so you're not likely to have what you need to support your off-spec. Remember this is classic, raids have more people and yet less gear drops. Some guilds are totally into min-max, they'd rather organize a retail style 25 man raid than 40 man with these "hybrids".

Does demoing when the debuff is already on build additional aggro?

Jazz fan here. I remember as a kid (like 14 years old) I went to a jazz playoff game that was on a Sunday in ‘07 and there was a guy with a “we like booze, even on sundays” sign in our section. Booze being Carlos boozer but as a non Mormon family my dad was fucking loving it
---
There is a soft crit cap and a hard crit cap
---
Soft crit cap is based on white attacks and hard crit cap is based on yellow attacks.
---
How to calculate hard  crit cap (yellow):
---
With 305 Weapon skill:
---
crit cap = 100% - 6% miss - 6% dodge + your hit%
---
How to calculate soft crit cap (white):
---
Without 305 Weapon skill:
---
100% - 24.6% miss - 6.5% dodge - 40% glance - 0% parry - 0% Block + 4,8% Crit Surpression + your hit%
---
100% - 24.6% miss - 6% dodge - 40% glance - 0% parry - 0% Block + 4,8% Crit Surpression + your hit%
---
NOTE: these formulas do not have parry or block values because we assume you are attacking your target always from behind!
---
People have been posting saying you have to demand a supervisor to actually look at your account and that fixes it if it is truly an error.
---
These threads are hilarious. Its always the same. "I want to play all classes and roles, help".
---
And to every piece of advice he gets its "yes this class seems good im leaning towards this specific class now"
---
Thats your problem! You like everything anyone says anything good about. No one can help you.

Weekly raids are fun at first but get very tedious. PvP is really fun, especially battlegrounds, but there's only so much WSG and AB you can do before it just feels like a grind. Solo content that grants gear is virtually non existent at 60.
---
Don't get me wrong, the community is great, and that's basically what the game turns into at 60. But the community is still there during the journey, and the journey is a lot more enjoyable than the destination, IMO.
---
If you’re a hunter you will want the Bow reward, Verdant Keeper’s Aim. That will carry you until you replace it in either Scholo, Strat, or MC.
---
Damage is normalized amongst animals of the same species.  Broken tooth may have a 1.0 attack speed, but the damage is lower per hit compared to 1.2, 1.5, or 2.0 attack speed cats.  He's just the best for pvp due to the spell pushback from attacking so fast.
---
For pve, go with a bat/carrion bird/owl.  Owls and bats have a 7% bonus to damage (cat has 10% bonus to dmg, -2% detriment to hp), carrion birds have a 5% bonus to armor.  Train them ONLY dive, growl and screech.   Screech is amazing aoe threat due to the melee damage debuff applying to every enemy in range (the damage portion of screech is only applied to the pet target).  Theres no cooldown for screech, so also training your bird claw is wasting training points.  The double whammy threat from damage AND a debuff outpaces the slight damage advantage that claw has, and since they both trigger the global cooldown, only one will ever get casted.
---
Wait until later raids/instances.

"New story"? The fuck're you talking about?

Everything I've seens says to use evisc/ferocious bite (respective of class). I will say I have found better result, on druid at least, using the one that was most recently trained. Might be worth trying both? Not sure what rogue regen energy is like though. Will note, I normally kill thing by the time I get 5cp without crits so its usually 4cp rip/fb :)

They nerfed the price back in the day. Once the farm became popular blizzard nerfed it.

A small taste of what’s to come.

&gt;Items go highest priority to any person who can use them, the second highest priority is profit. Anything else is a ninja imo.
---
A Hunter can *use* staff of Jordan.
---
&gt;I’ve run dozens of dungeons and had a few solid boes drop, and every single time the group of randoms has been cool with the class who can wear it taking it. 
---
I've run hundreds, each and every time, save times where I've had friends as the entire group, sellable epics are need for all. 
---
&gt;If the dude wants to sell it after that, I really don’t give a shit, because the item wasn’t mine anyway and it went to the person who should have it. 
---
That is 100% a ninja. You're now contradicting yourself.
---
&gt;I did a fair amount of raiding in vanilla and I also do not remember your way of doing things being the default way, though I do remember people saying what you’re saying now being disagreed with back then too.
---
I've never experienced a pug raid that has done anything other than master loot, MS &gt; OS, these are specific examples where everyone is max level so if an item of value drops it's probably just easier to offer it to MS instead of going through 40 rolls.
---
I will put it very simply for you, and anyone else that reads this far down this shithole of a discussion. 
---
A BoE item when it drops in a group, does not portray the item it actually is.
---
It portrays the amount of gold the item may be sold for.
---
Afaik every class has BoE BiS items, So an item able to be sold, has the same value to each and every person. Whether they can use the item, or not.
---
If you can use the item, you are *saving* the gold you would otherwise spend on the item. If you're planning to sell it, you're *gaining* the amount of gold the item sells for. Both people are metaphorically being "greedy".
---
If you can use the item, but weren't going to spend the gold on it, how can you ever justify it being a need?
---
The reason every needs is to remove the chance of someone ninjaing the item.

There is no official guild bank in Classic. Guilds provide no perks and are really just a way of organizing people. You get a guild chat channel and that's pretty much it.

To start one, buy a charter and get 10 signatures from un-guilded players.

Or they'll stand up, cancelling their drink just to pop an "emergency" heal on me. 
---
I'm a warlock, half the time I'm siphoning life on more than one mob, every mob tagged and allowed to tick the full 30 seconds gives me at least enough HP to lifetap. Along with my passive regens, I'm kinda the last guy on your list you really should be concerned with. 
---
DPS starts going down, don't stress. Let them die every so often. You keep the tank alive, he keeps you alive, and the rest of us are optional at best.

Eh, Questie is probably a good one for someone new to wow to have.same with shadoweduf, it’s probably a lot easier for her to notice when her health and her targets health are right there

Imagine me bothering to reply again
---
Honestly your only shot against a lock is to either kick the fear or stun lock. I main rogue as well and if you get feared... you're dead brother.
---
I played a mage back in vanilla and bc.  It was pretty standard to makes stacks of water to give out when I grouped up.  People never had to ask cus I would just do it.
---
Okay, bro, I've got you. Typically you wanna open with Ambush or Cheap Shot, if they sacrafice their Void Walker, go for the Blind restealth reset and just sap them to wait for the shield to wear off. You have to plan around being feared at least once so bleeding them with garrote/rupture is a good way to maintain pressure. Alwayd Gouge/Kick if you dont have bleeds because you can restealth for another cheap shot. After they use/or dont have, their shield they become a joke to kill. 
---
It's completely worth to vanish their fear if need be. Gl, bro.
---
Yup tclap is for late game and a dps warrior can help you with that.
---
I’ve been a fan of intercept charge WW berserker rage then going def stance.
---
Don’t use that when going into mobs that stun.
---
It gives you snap threat, a chance for deep wounds to proc for minor threat gain, and the extra rage from berserk rage is great for going into your tab sunder rotation with minimum damage from the berserk stance debuff
---
same, great choice for pet
---
Hard disagree.
---
That’s just a canned response. Keep prying and insisting that they have a supervisor review the logs again.
---
Well that’s fair I guess :p
---
What’s he so sweaty
---
Because Fear Ward doesn’t exist.
---
How is there possibly a tank shortage, isn't like 40% of the playerbase warriors?
---
As a former mage in Vanilla/BC I'd say the mage should have stacks ready to hand out in a dungeon.  It's part of the role.  It's nice to be thanked but not getting thanked isnt a big deal.
---
and their gm condones ninjalooting boots of avoidance
---
I was in STV doing quests when I accidentally pulled more mobs than I could handle.
---
just when I thought I was staring a long graveyard run in the face, a hordie came out of nowhere and started helping me fight off the mobs. even with his help it was an incredibly close call, and I only had a sliver of health left when the last mob fell. I used emotes to thank him for saving me.
---
then he stabbed me in the face.
---
The world is a big place dude.
---
It helps when asking for server advice to specify your location. Are you NA, EU, Oceanic, China or South America?
---
Mortal shots
---
Stuff doesnt die cuz its "2 levels above me cuz im too lazy to level in appropriate zones". But do whatever makes you enjoy leveling. You shoudlnt care for dps at level 39 lmao
---
Appropriate gear that has intellect on it to increase your mana pool.
---
yes you could, you dont NEED water from the mage. you can do a dungeon just fine without it as your supposed to bring your own. 
---
imagine a group invites a rogue instead of the mage, do you ask the rogue for water? ofc not, hes a rogue
---
does your world crumble because you didnt get water? no because you should of came prepared.
---
as a mage, ill give any dungeon member food or water if they ask. but too pretend like you cant go on without it, is just petty.
---
some mages just dont want to spend the next 5+ minutes casting conjour water and drinking to regen.
---
particularly when your sub 60, cuz every 10 lvls you get new water. and that water is only castable 2 at a time til the next lvl. where its 4, then 6 then 8. by the time your casting 20 per your bout to get the tiers at your next level up (and at that point your likely grouping with mages with the new stuff)
---
some will refuse to take lower tier water while they DEMAND you give em the 'good' water. so they'll ask for 2-3 stacks of the water you just learned. and it takes you a good 20-30 casts (yes CASTS) to make that much. thats multiple attempts at sitting down and drinking.
---
ive had many priests get mad at me when i gave em the previous tier of water, as if its my fault. they should of been happy they got anything.
---
this cuntery goes both ways, for every mage that refuses to give water too there group theres a clothie that refuses to take the easier to make peasant water because they are entitled pricks.
---
They’re two totally different games and world PvP is vastly different on retail.
---
exactly my point
---
That’s the joke though
---
On my first pug MC run after hitting 60 a Shardstrike dropped.  Hunter named "Ineedthis" won. To top it off, a warrior was pissed off and trying to convince people it was a warrior BiS weapon.  Made my day.  First and only time I was happy to see that pop up on loot.
---
Start with cooperation, then change to tit-for-tat when they fuck you first.  Usually the best strategy in game theory.
---
This is fuckin dope. I just picture Herod in there working out harder than any pro athlete, his zeal just pushes him farther every day.
---
They should have made Herod a more integral part of the Scarlet lore. They could have done a lot more with it, but it wasn't terrible either.
---
The way they have it now is we can interpret the bosses role and background within the Order pretty clearly and fill in the blanks. Leads to the example from OP.
---
Either way, really nice picture. Been enjoying these.
---
Not really. Economies are totally different. Even on live you can’t do that except by buying a char xfer.
---
DAMN IT! I'll have to check, thanks for the tip!

I dont know how steamwheedle guards work tbh. But he is definitely in a location where guards can attack him if they aggro on him, unlike when they are on top of houses where guards do aggro, but can't reach them.

Just attacking people outside the aggro range of guards is not against the rules. Else they would've made it so people just die instantly if they attack other players, or to have guards spawn directly on them if they do it.

---
There is currently a significant bug with priest healing right now. After a few respecs, I'm pretty sure the issue lies with the talent that converts + spirit into spellpower/healing. 
---
As seen in the gif, you lose a bunch of healing per tick of renew simply by logging out. I respecced just before the vid, specced into the 21/30/0 priest spec, and lost 35 hp per renew tick. 
---
This behavior does NOT appear to happen with only 1 or 2 points into the talent, but definitely happens with all 5 points in it.
---
If anybody is willing to check their healing values for things pre respec, post respec, and post logging in/out, for other spells, that'd be amazing. The difference is pretty big (12%), so you'd likely see pretty quickly for the other heals.
---
It's just for your own use and all client side if I'm not mistaken. No one but you can see the notes you write.

I absolutely heard this as well lol

90% of the tanks that I've seen so far didn't do that, but had to deal with losing agro all over the place because of early DPS. I would say that is the primary issue.
---
I've gotten into the habit of *always* clearing my mana bar before hopping on a flight. Makes a world of difference.
---
It's true. Although designed as a clothie as well, mage feels far more vulnerable than priests and warlock.

Shadow will give you really good damage, a lot of priests run shadow spec while leveling and still heal dungeons when necessary.

Crazy idea, but maybe just make a cat form power shift macro and then just have prowl as a normal key bind?

Just wait for BGs to release and the horde crying about long queues. Even with cross-realm, the queues will still be quite long for horde players due to the imbalance on most servers.
---
Yes - not sure what’s up
---
Considering it's perfectly plausible to spend 54&gt;60 doing nothing but dungeons for gear, swap when you've decided to stop questing/soloing exclusively.
---
NA
---
I like the free transfer idea. A lot of servers are going to start dropping in population past playability. Just take the low pop servers and let people choose to move to a new server and help the population imbalance problem or stay on their low pop server.
---
Fem orcs ftw
---
I think it's pretty easy to file this under disruption of gameplay. Seems pretty logical to think that using third party communication to work with the opposing faction isn't an intended way to play the game.
---
You usually pop everything you have in wpvp. You really want to live and keep your buffs when defending your quest farm area. Makes it easier to kill them again without use of CDs if you need to. Almost every pally I fight pops either bubble or LoH. 
---
So it makes sense his wpvp highlights are from recklessness.

Yep, i understand. Got it on my rogue lvl 49 atm. Still, the result is not the same as when used it on my warrior back in nostalrius days. Thanks)))

Raiding isn't all this game has to offer, other common things to do is grind mobs for rep or gold, do some world PvP or dueling, farm dungeons for rare items or rep, etc. Not all of those require that you deal 1% more damage at all times, for example on mob grinding, having extra Intellect and Spirit allows you to kill more mobs before having to drink, or in PvP where Stamina is very good.

I would try for a standard deep holy build or a 26/25 split build. It’ll help you save gold so you don’t have to respec if you grabbed bad talents but play on your build if you prefer! I don’t think I have any holy dps talents but I still am going ok in solo content just would prefer group stuff.
---
There's not really much outside your gearing list. Molten core and onyxia attunement is all you need. Beyond that it's about what you decide you want to gear with.
---
There's no in game solution to this problem.  
---
Most pvp problems have a pvp solution. This doesn't because there's collusion between the factions.
---
Vol chan baka!
---
Thats exactly what I did. I made sure to roll need on everything from that boss before I left, then dropped group and sat down waiting for the automatic hearth. The other 3 people were in his guild and pretty clearly real life friends with him. I dont feel bad about it at all. I had another group in less than 5 minutes.
---
I have dual monitors and am gonna do this instead now so i dont have to look away from the game.
---
To be fair, as Shamans are usually expected to heal, they need that into too :(
---
Is elemental M part of GCD?
---
Mage need AQ gear I've heard before they start topping charts.
---
The creativity that people have with names on this is too entertaining
---
tried this out tonight, thanks.  i dont like the big border that goes around it
---
You don’t know anything about this guy or his life. Stop projecting your own insecurities.
---
They must have lost the roll to you ;)
---
Yeah, haven't made many posts on reddit and typed up a text description that was eaten when I posted. Whoops!
---
Venting their frustration after &lt;A Bunch Of Idiots&gt; handed them their asses in felwood, and too chicken-shit to do it on their own server after said ass whippin'
---
And it also works on range abilities too so even matches vs Mages and Warlocks isn’t too much of disadvantage either.
---
Is it possible to manually type in the name of a mage I memorized from 20 levels ago?
---
man once i hit 45 its time for the BIS grind there are a few items i can get around 45 for rogue everything else is in the 50s so im guessing its gonna take me awhile to get my other bis items tho
---
Theres a 2h mace in sm cath end boss
---
Not until phase 3
---
Still not as clean and clear as suf.
---
I will never be able to look at the map normally again. Thanks
---
I don't really watch streamers aside from the occasional speedrun.  My retail guild and I went to Faerlina because it's the place to be for anything big in classic wow and I think the Method duel tournament is the perfect example of what I mean.  No other server will get events like that.  Period.  
---
I'm glad you guys are all happy on whatever server you chose to roll on.  I'm happy on mine.
---
True, but you also have to be in battle stance to use it, and it costs about the same as a sunder with the reduced rage cost talent anyway. I didnt take the rage loss reduction talent either so stance swapping for it doesnt make a lot of sense. But yeah if someone pulls immediately off the charge ill generally pop that before i stance swap to defensive.
---
When you’re walking on a path and /wave at the enemy rogue walking towards you and they stealth
---
This is out ranging agro, not safespotting. Safespotting refers to guards being agrod, but unable to do shit.
---
Honestly that addon was never made for classic and isn’t going to work.
---
Go download the wowpro vanilla guide and thank me later. Literally so much better.
---
As a warlock you can solo the drakes in ST and if you wanna be Nice, bring a mage for food and chance of getting his/her offhand aswell
---
Haha I would but I respect the fight, gankers I catch get the cannibalize &gt;:)
---
That just means one faction is more popular, not that one faction attracts more of a certain type of player that likes to gank. Human nature dictates that you will gank when you think you can make the kill. Scarlet Monastery is hell for Alliance,  Uldaman is hell for Horde. On my server which I am playing horde on currently, Alliance gets mercilessly raped in SM, and then make up for it outside Uldaman, and outside ZF (not sure why ZF, but they consistently have people camping the entrance, probably payback for SM). Stereotyping off of faction is retarded.
---
I don't play priest, so I can't speak for that part.
---
About the dungeons, you could try getting 1 more level in cathedral (either dps or healing normal/aoe groups depending on your preference). 
---
Soon, you will be able to do Zul'Farak. There is a little gap between it amd cathedral though, but it should be no problem if you're healing at first. Maybe others can help complete my comment and offer other options
---
I’d get into Searing Gorge at around 45 and then you get the build up to Blackrock Mountain story. I had memories of Feralas being a cool and fun zone but actually questing in it as Alliance is a massive pain in the arse due to its remote location, dumb flight path that doubles back on itself, and the fact your base is stuck on a stupid island meaning an additional boat or swim every time you come back.
---
Laughs in dwarf
---
Seriously. I hope the average age of this sub is like 16, because any older and the Asmon hysteria is really, truly embarrassing.
---
Yes, probably the most disrespectful emote in game, reserve it for your most hated enemies. This was just an Alliance I picked a fight with so no real beef.
---
And what about the rest of his friends? His guild? His audience? You want the rest of them to buy a second account too?
---
Come on, don't be like this, it's ridiculous.
---
And have the freedom to swap OHs as needed
---
Wait, how? You’ve gotta kill jammal’an, don’t you?
---
Which addon shows how many items are in your bags, AH, or alts?
---
Omg how have i never thought of this... all of those drinks... drinken
---
You are trash for letting your sweet poor mother attempt to play with that UI.
---
Always buff tank last and dont top off his HP until you have drank.
---
Once tanks see that they are good to go, most just go.
---
Missing buff or hp makes them realize you're still working on it. Seems to work on most tanks.
---
I find it so nice that she's willing to give it a try. It's such a game!
---
Same thing happened toe in SFK. We had a tank and heals and 2 DPS. Couldn’t find another DPS, so we decide 4 man it.
---
Then tank DCs so we three man with switching tank between my enh shaman and the heals shaman that was resto spec.
---
3 manned and took down Arugal. Robes dropped. It was amaze.
---
Literally rolled a mage this time around for this item hahaha.
---
I believe you lose everything.

Didn't even need to group up to move on. I left Valley of Trials at level 2 and moved on to Tiragarde Keep to fight the level 5-7 mobs. They took longer to kill, but I wasn't competing with anybody. Made getting ahead of the zerg quite easy.
---
It's not that you can't get into raids, it's just that a raid leader with 100% of their DPS slots filled and only 70% of the healing spots will say no to you as DPS but yes as a healer. You'll have significantly less competition for healing spots in a raid, and unless you join a guild that's willing to explicitly add slot for a shadow priest to their roster you'll struggle to convince raid leaders to take you over one of the hunters/locks/mages in the queue behind you.
---
No one's saying you can raid as shadow, but it will be significantly harder than going in as heals.
---
I like how Rag is essentially the posterchild for Classic, yet he was so easy to kill for so many people.
---
it's like if ratata was the face of pokemon
---
I really enjoy this version of leveling as opposed to retail's current form. It takes a long time for sure but it feels much more satisfying to me. I'm a lot more proud of my lvl 50 I have in classic than I was of the lvl 70 I made in retail a year ago( I quit after getting that far because lvling felt empty to me).
---
You don't have to worry about raiding, there are always going to be people doing phase one stuff, you for sure aren't the only person still in their lvl 30's. 
---
If anything this is probably better because you'll be able to experience the content with other people who put in a similar amount of time to the game as you rather than people who are speeding through the content at mach 10.
---
Also, you can be gathering gold, materials, leveling up crafting profession etc as you go through the leveling process right now in preparation for acquiring your bis gear.
---
Restorative potion will help you win against any warlock-shadow priest (unless they realize whats happening and dispel it)
---
Best is subjective. It's the fastest
---
Theres an option to remove the border
---
They also said layering would never go away and you were stupid to think otherwise(it’s gone on some servers, and will be on other soon enough). They also said layering would ruin everything. They said nobody would stick around thing long. 
---
People said a lot of things that have since been proven patently untrue. Class bullshit included.
---
Finishing quests in zones you haven’t isn’t terrible, at least you don’t need to worry about ah stuff. Only works til you’ve done most the quests though. If you can get a consistent group to run smooth quick instances (like scholo with lots of boss drops, since you’re already pre-bis), you can vender them and it’s more fun than farming herbs. Otherwise just working the ah and investing in upcoming markets or finding good deals is where the money really is, but that gets tedious.
---
What an amazing pun.i gotta give you that one
---
You mean kidney shot?
---
I agree that it's not great aesthetically. But, hands down, barrens is top notch for questing efficiency just because it is flat. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to take a short cut during early level alliance zones just to end up having to back track because you can't get up some small hill.
---
1. Literally no one claimed AoE farming was a new thing. 
---
2. It’s cool if you like to do dungeons my guy. Some people like to do those. Some people like to quest. Some people like to mix it up. Some people fish. Weird right?
---
I think a lot of it is also due to undeveloped terrain. I did a lot of exploring in original vanilla and got to areas that were definitely not intended to get to and the terrain just stopped or went flat and had words or faces drawn on them by devs lol. So i think the flight pathing was to avoid that. Also why flight paths completely avoid hyjal.
---
Would love to get back in there too see archimondes skeleton on the world tree. Just crazy how much content they put up there too never be seen by most people.
---
Cathedral is viable up to 43, after that you should be able to do ZF. 44 should be fine to DPS ZF but you should be able to heal it earlier than that
---
In Frost We Trust baby, thats been ingrained into me since its release.
---
I so badly want this to be untrue :(
---
So, early thirties is sluggish, it’s hard to find a zone to groove in. But I suggest sticking it out and get into SM GY stuff when you can. It gets better, but you have to accept that leveling is a sizeable part of the game. Classic isn’t very fun to rush to 60 to farm those dungeons. They are cool, but so are dungeons along the way like Uldaman, Zul Farrak, Sunken Temple. And aoe grinding for highest exp/ hour will ultimately leave you disappointed imo.
---
You might find that retail is just more your style of the grind is not what you enjoy.
---
Personally, I LOVE classic BGs and I wish they were in already, I think that was a mistake.
---
60 going on level 60.
---
My friend rolled a Hunter and was talking about an IRL Aggro drop when he makes mistakes in dungeons.. “sorry guys just your average Huntard”
---
He isn’t the best at the game and he plays on a laptop but god damn is he great for team morale :P
---
Dont open with ambush. Cs kidney everytime
---
Ah, thanks so much. I'm glad to have a solid answer. 
---
What about the guild banner? What's that all about?
---
And here I feel bad if they ask for water and I haven't made it already.
---
Making water takes more than 3 seconds unless youre max level or a level off of the next tier of water. For decent, level appropriate water, you only get 2-10 per cast, and its a few hundred mana per cast. Expecting 3 stacks for everyone with a manabar means the mage is going to spend about 10 minutes just making water.
---
I'm not saying you shouldnt make water. I always make water for the group. But 60 water per caster? Thats a bigger time investment than you realise.
---
Yeah I get that as a solution, but it's more about that I shouldn't have to do that. When someone says hold for any reason you wait untill everyone is ready before you go.
---

He is fake and toxic. If you watch his older videos he’s a completely different person.

If you miss a tranq in raids 40 people will die
---
Last time I have checked noggenfogger was one of the most horde dominated server. I would not call it smallest imbalance.
---
So 99% of them? That goes for warriors as well. The general population isn't great at the game.
---
I’ve actually been pvp’ing a little more lately and it does spice things up a little
---
Spellcleave has a bad rep on this  subreddit, but I spent a night doing spellcleave in Scarlet Monastery Cathedral and it was the most fun I had in WoW Classic thus far. As with all things WoW, though, it was just a matter of *who* you are doing it with, rather than *what* you are doing--we were a bantering, high-energy bunch, joking and full of bravado, doing increasingly ridiculously vast pulls and trying to goad the horde into flagging for PvP every time we went out to reset. I wouldn't want to do it all the time, but I feel people being close-minded about it *ever* being fun are doing themselves a disservice. 
---
After 39 levels of traditional WoW taking a modern approach to a WoW dungeon was a fun change of pace.
---
Rip, did you just power through it?
---
Wait! Did't you guys had you MC raid on 10th anniversary? /s
---
They made LFR version of MC back in start of WoD in 2014.
---
They stated any form of avoiding guard attacks INSIDE a guarded city is a warning then a ban, so yes he is breaking the rules.
---
Ok that’s good to know. I’ve been slightly worried recently thinking about how long it’s gonna take
---
How about you stop caring about random people?
---
You are the reason. Not anybody else.
---
I know, don’t remind me!!
---
Thinking the same. Praying that I get to keep my eyesight and hand movements when I get older :)
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Yeah I just learnt all of my skills I hadn’t learned, so went from 160 to 50 real quick 😓
---
That is true it's pretty num lock only friendly haha that is nice
---
As a human it doesnt matter as much as you have an increased skill from racials. Anything other than human will get a huge boost from edgemasters on alliance, hence the massive price tag
---
asmongold was never going to herod...
---
So you can use this macro, but when your trying to go back to Defensive stance instead of cast, use castsequence so a quick double tap will switch to battle, mocking blow, then back to defensive stance. I use similar kacros for beserker rage and intercept.
---
Well it was around 40/60 at the beginning. By now it feels like 20/80.
---
Still better than being on a 80/20 server.
---
Those statistics are just destroying wow balance. Imo they should never be released or taken off the internet asap.
---
I don’t even play Mage atm - leveled one on Pservers to refresh my mind for Classic. But god damn i’d be lying to say I didn’t hate people spamming me for food water and ports in city. I’m happy to help out if I can, sometimes I will be 100% AFK though and theres nothing I can do.
---
Also when they ask for a port and proceed to jump through, drop group and not even say thanks. I don’t want a tip but the 18s you cost me would have been thanks enough. If everyone acted like that it would cost Mages mega gold just to afk in a city :/
---
Kill satyrs in Azshara for rune and felcloth while herbing dreamfoil
---
Its a bop robe, gotta craft it for yourself
---
I feel the complete opposite.
---
Im 60 with my warrior and did about a hundred arena runs and kinda lost interest farming bis when my guild clears mc and onyxia with ease anyways and im gonna get raid gear eventually anyways.
---
Leveling is nice because its always steadily going upwards.
---
&gt;The vast majority of players are 50s and just hitting 60
---
Nope. Not even close. I feel like even if you just said the majority of players you would be vastly incorrect.
---
This blew my mind, it makes to much sense. 
---
"Teir whores, all of you!"
---
It’s not this deep
---
Now THIS is pvp
---
I actually really didn’t mind it in raids, I felt like a king of the feast at times. The other trick was if you need a 5-min break you just say “trade (othermage) for water - he got you” :P
---
Ran Arms over 40 times and saw 1 ravager. Hunter rolled on it and I lost. I quit my paladin after that. Just keep trying and don't bring anyone with you that will steal it.
---
I mean i bleed blue but my room is messy and i like angry music. I just dont fuck with gross ugly bois
---
Why you all have those "cool" names?
---
My voidwalkers names always end with org as if it was some budget internet site
---
Ok to be fair my imp is called Jaklop and thats ok because it reminds me of the name Jakob.
---
I will try this next time I need something
---
I'm off evenings.   I'll use the ole demon dog if I play when your on.  Should be no conflict.
---
Keep it up man. You got this!!
---
I too hate using the “Conjure Money” spell, clicking is so hard..
---
(Lighthearted humour btw - I love you Mages)
---
I wouldnt read too much into it. Mages are really popular, and people only remember the bad ones. 90% of my dungeon runs have a mage and no one has raged at any of them. The only gripe I have is some farming in hillebrand, because they inadvertently pull the unique mobs for people's quests and it's annoying. 
---
Just two tips. If you're aoe farming, try to be considerate of those that arent. And when you're in a dungeon, try to let the tank build up some threat before using any aoe spells.
---
Seriously, if you enjoy the class and you dont screw anyone over, just keep on keepin' on.
---
Maybe they can't do those instances yet?
---
Thats because you play alliance. Believe it or not, it happens on both sides.
---
Yeah Copper bars were selling for about 80s a stack on my server a little while ago because of lazy prof powerlevelers. That shit is insane. i spent like an hour farming durotar for copper and made like close to 10g.
---
Heartseeker?
---
I mean it's good on shamans though
---
didn't realise adults still made these jokes in 2019
---
U are stupid if u play on mograine EU pls tell me youre char name so i Can put u on Ignore
---
Its more the entitlement of the lock spamming life tap thinking they "dont have to worry about mana and health" which causes the healer to have to pause the run more meaning overall its slower than not healing the lock. Also I dont play a healer. I play a warrior and a lock alt.
---
Doesn't make sense to mention them if they are unobtainable.
---
You can go back and do the quests for rep yes.
---
I would say it's closer to 35-45 or even a bit lower. This sub is way more hardcore than the general population and there is still a lot of people here just hitting 30
---
My apologies. I did not mean to misrepresent your position.
---
probably top 5 cringiest things i've ever heard, fail of a troll
---
Also it's similar to 50 AP passive, so it's huge.
---
The only thing that's excessive is the swing timer. She'd probably ignore details regardless.
---
Questing as a protection warrior... ? Boy you maste hate yourself :D
---
The solution to that is to spec Fury (for Warriors) or 30 Feral / 21 Resto (for Druids). Be up front with your dungeon groups and tell them that you plan to roll on DPS or healing gear in addition to your tank gear. Being able and willing to fill multiple roles will make finding raid spots a breeze.
---
Or just start your own raid groups. Finding 40 players for MC is not hard as a tank if you advertise, say, a week in advance.
---

One thing I can say is if every Mage happily handed out Water and Food at raids to people who needed it you wouldn’t have to keep track.
---
This thread seems to be a tug-of-war with assholes on each side though, I do see where you guys are coming from!
---
I remember doing my first benediction quest. Congrats.
---
Ppl just mad that recklessness brings the smackdown, pop those coolies bro swifty no pinky that sheit
---
My voids pretty lame as well. So I feel you. I was looking at a list someone made and some are really random so it could be worse I guess.
---
inb4 everyone in Classic yells before every roll.
---
The utility is the whole reason I rolled Warlock. I mained Elemental Shaman back in OG vanilla and wanted to be more useful this time around. I'm always first the to dungeon to begin summons with a full bag of shards for healthstones and soulstone. Have my Imp's stam buff trained up. That's half the point of the class.
---
Anyone can do damage. Only certain classes have specific buffs or utilities. It makes your class unique and makes people want to group with you.
---
Always put in the most effort you can. Otherwise you're just wasting people's time and they won't put up with that. Time is the one resource in this life that we can't get more of.
---
I have all my conversations with people "so much more knowledgeable than me" saved in regards to how I'm "so wrong about layering" and detailed explanations of how it will "ruin the game" and "never go away." So fucking funny lol
---
Warlock because mages are gay
---
You can fish 1-300 in the cities because it only matters that you don't get the "missed fish" status. It's not suggested though, because you should lvl cooking at the same time and that requires certain fish in certain zones.
---
Is that Bill Paxton and joe Pesci on stallag
---
Yeah , I’ve found that totally works out fine. Just saying it’s hard for us at first , and heal over time every now and again are nice. But yeah, do teach the locks a lesson, who tap to zero, and then stare. Once you get your succ and the free soul bag, we have no excuse to not have plenty of shards to use
---
So just an update. Decided to do it and grab the flight paths on the way. Got really lucky and it dropped for me after about 2/3 of an experience bar.  Now what do I ask for it?
---
Well not really. The lock can immediately get to moving on to the next pack instead of having to stop and heal.
---
Meanwhile the healer can drink for two for 5-10 seconds while the tank is tanking the next pack.
---
It is way more efficient for the healer to heal the lock in almost all cases. This doesn't factor in the fact that a healer shouldn't have to be drinking after every pull, more like every 7-10 pulls.
---
Honestly the worst levels are 52-60.  All of the end game zones are awful and pretty quest sparse.
---
Ahmm. Yes, yes. Quite.
---
Its so damn awesome to acquire items like this. I keep developing more and more love towards my character, i never want to stop playing this.
---
Thanks! Its really damn awesome
---
As someone who has mained a mage since original vanilla, I don't understand their mindset. I've never even had to be asked to hand out water; everyone wants free water that saves them from having to dip into their own stash. It should be considered part of the mage's role in the group.
---
I'm a lock, but I've unironicly done that. Mage will give me like a full trade window of water and I might use 3 of them...
---
Can I just ask - whats an appropriate tip? Cause I hate over-tipping 50s for a lockbox that gives me 30s back and I hate feeling like I wasted the persons time.
---
Saying that I only ask Rogues who are standing around in cities but its still a wonder. Shit i’d give them half of the green value in every lockbox just for the chance at a rare or epic.
---
We should be able to put Soul Link on the tank. Now I can Hellfire forever!
---
I know this is a joke, but he does earn like half a mill a year just from subs, pretty nuts. Then he has donations and if he does sponsorships 
---
there's that too. I can say for sure I wouldn't give a shit if people were getting upset if I was making content for that much money.
---
no water for you then
---
Questie, vendor price, and auto trash sell/repair addons are very nice. You're right. That's what I've got on my gf's computer.
---
That guild name reminds me a guild from zenedar-bladefist-frostwhisper
---
I honestly believe that only about 5% of the dps's understands threat. That and how LoS works.. 
---
I bearly have the patience to pug dungeons anymore.
---
Go with the WW Hammer and play slam spec, fuck that axe
---
correct.  stats are all that matter for spellcaster weapons.
---
I was not restricting that comment to priests specifically, probably why people were downvoting me.
---
SM runs are the fastest if you get a good group and you can do multiple runs with the same group. SM runs become really inefficient if you keep having to wait for new players or have a bad and slow group, or just can't find a group
---
Who is this guy? And why do people care.. I don't watch him
---
Thank you!
---
Your mother is already level 60 ;)
---
You are more than your class. If it bothers you that much, put in a couple minutes here or there making water for people in your capital. Heck actually advertise you're doing it.
---
You can't change the image of mages, but you can be the exception and become well loved for it.
---
You need actual leverage on your server. I've gotten ninjas who I have complete proof of, banned from guilds, and from raids, including pugs. Get some power on your server, then you can do something.
---
Imp name is Zurili
---
Succu is Fiorola
---
Void I dont remember, he's never with me.
---
So I've been running ZF on my tank for the last few days leveling and as a tank my biggest pet peeve is DPS pulling shit on their own. Today we get this hunter in our group that from the very first pull decides to do his own thing. 
---
Pulls extra mobs, pulls mobs when other people are trying to drink, attacks stuff when im trying to LOS it before it even gets close to me. A couple times through the dungeon I make a remark like "Hey let me pull please" or "If im trying to LOS let them get to me before you attack please".
---
The SGT Bly fight I mark 2 targets, the first time all dungeon. He instantly goes for one of the mobs thats not marked at all then attacks the X while the skull is still up. 
---
Annoying but whatever. 
---
He asks us to kill Hydromancer after the final boss (no mallet) to which we say sure. 
---
We get to the final boss and I mark one with skull and one with X. Suddenly I see Hunters mark on the X. Again I made a joke like "If you attack the X first instead of the skull you're grounded" or something like that. Just trying to find a semi-friendly way to tell him to not be a derp. 
---
He re-adjusts his target. We down the boss and start running to Hydromancer. I notice he hasn't rolled on the Ripsaw. I thought it was weird but at first didnt think anything of it. Then when he runs in and pulls Hydromancer I realized what he was about too do but it was too late. We downed Hydromancer, he needs on the ripsaw, then leaves group. 
---
It's about 3G. Not the end of the world. It's more about him just being a dick overall in the entire dungeon and then calling me a prick and telling me i was having a power trip? REALLY? Is politely asking to pull my own mobs and letting me LOS really having a power trip? 
---
Server is Bigglesworth, to everyone else my gf and i have ran with in the last few days and weeks you have all been great, it's honestly been a ton of fun overall.
---
Edit: TLDR: Hunter ignores the group and does whatever he wants all run, asks the group to kill hydromancer for him, then ninjas the drop from the final boss just for the vendor gold and leaves group.
---
Keep it up! Good shit.
---
FYI - leveling tailoring up to 265ish is very cheap. I did it for under 40g then farmed the runecloth I needed for 300. I suggest shooting for the Archmage Pattern!
---
Just started my warrior Orc alt. Is a 2 handed axe the way to go when I will always level with a shaman friend? Or should I go for the dual wield which is more dps I believe. Heroic strike at the end of arms sounds pretty cool from what other people are saying.
---
No, 24 hrs does **not** give you a better chance to sell. Citations needed. 24 hrs gives you a better chance to be undercut and not sell.
---
24 hrs you are PAYING for listing over off-peak hours whereas shorter auctions are more under your control (Aka only off-peak when you specially choose, per the fallacy you presented).

Lol look at all the downvotes these posts are getting haha. People hate on streamers way too much and everyone was doing spell cleave without streamers you guys dont know what you are on about.. maybe blame the private server players for finding all the current metas people are using right now.
---
And that is your choice to do it that way.  If you want to have access to professions, level an alt.
---
What kind of monster doesn't use class colors in raid frames?
---
2 Fozruk 1 mine
---
Most people don't quest past 52-54ish.
---
I spent all of 54&gt;60 in BRD getting gear. No XP runs, some runs to help guildmates. I haven't done a single non-dungeon quest since then.
---
Now that I've gotten what I want out of BRD, I'm moving on to strat/scholo. It's more or less endgame life anyway, might as well start early.
---
This is what experienced players like to call "world pvp." I think you need to chill
---
While I dont have a issue with streamers this situation does rub me the wrong way. Had he simply said hey I wanna make a horde and wanted to play on the next highest server. However when he flat out pretty much tried to blackmail the server into giving him things and meeting his demands or he was going to send all of his followers to simply ruin aspects of the server for everyone on it including those who had no part in whatever drama between him and reddit there was. That was when it got into ToS territory for harassment and such to me.
---
I have been playing a tank for a while now and groups are super easy to get into. 
---
But im thinking of rerolling to rogue because i miss my rogue. 
---
Screw it im rerolling rogue. Goodbye my warrior with 12 days played hello rogue fun.

And walk away.
---
Seems like a really easy way to get caught
---
If you're the 3rd or 4th tank, id recommend speccing fury or fury prot and just do dps, and have tanking gear on or with you atleast for when tanking is nessesary.  If you don't enjoy fury and dont enjoy of tanking then you might have chosen the wrong class.
---
Is probably bc it's tedious and ooms them.  The good water only creates a lil at a time and they'll have to drink in between, but still if you're in a group just MAKE THE DAMNED WATER for your team!
---
heroic strike is never good to use even if specced into it for dps/holding agro best to just spam sunder, you lose way too much rage using heroic
---
Not even the first time this month
---
He's not. When he plays with his friend Zack (on Zack's stream) he's pretty chill, so chill that everyone thought he was depressed.
---
This is the best kind of help.

I am indeed a laptop pleb - this is perfect.

My imps name is “Lazyal” lol
---
Indeed! Verily, I say... ergo.
---
If you are a mage in a group of mine you will hand out food and water, for free, to everyone who asks. If you have a problem with this then fuck off and find another group because you are extremely easy to replace and nobody has time for your bullshit.
---
Outside of that by all means people should tip you for your time and skills they don't have. But when you join a group, free food and water is part of what you bring *to* that group.
---
Top end is actually not what you should care about. It's USUALLY right. But not always. It's actually calculated off of the middle of the range (average of top/bottom) which is occasionally higher on a weapon with a lower top end.
---
But yeah, the damage is more important than the dps itself when it comes to abilities.
---
If she never played she wont know what basic UI looks like, she will get used to this look.
---
I'm level 51 right now with 5 in shadow, 11 in holy, and the rest (25?) in discipline. I'm going quests solo in ungoro right now with no problem, don't feel too slow, and often I can find a rogue or warrior to team up with. Plus I'm a great healer in ZF and Mara with ST in my sights. I think you could do something like that no problem and stay viable until 60.
---
ive wanted this for so long lol hopefully soon im lvl 48 atm
---
Try finding a guild that clears AQ and Naxx as a moonkin. 
---
  
---
Everyone's grandma could clear MC.
---
Love how you can just swim right through the peninsula south of silverpine forest lol. Undeveloped terrain cracks me up.
---
That's why you agree on boe loot policy before the run . Either everyone agrees to greed or need or whatever.
---
Then if someone breaks that agreement you can report em with proof of the agreement and get them temp banned and the item removed
---
Exactly people are doing it because its literally the fastest way by far
---
I played prot war up to 4h in vanilla when my guild ended up dissolving. I dont like dosing. I like tanking.
---
That would mean they are simply rival businesses then.
---
I play horde on this server , hope to see you on there!
---
I can't help but think how much easier if this dude got a more modern setup.... much lighter for one.
---
Imp is Azpad, viod is Tangthak and succ is Disona. Can't decide which I like best. Think Disona or Azpad.
---
🤘🏻

How I make water if all my actionbar is blizzards?

Silithus if you can stealth, Winterspring is a decent spot, Searing Gorge, Burning Steepes
---
Thanks for the info! I was scared it would seriously delay my epic mount but that's way cheaper than I expected.
---
Yes blessing of freedom in lagfest raid vs raid is no advantage at all.
---
u dont need a guide... just google the best macros for your class
---
There's some really annoying mob packs that guard rich thorium veins. Only rogue miners can really access them without wanting to commit IRL suicide considering how thick and cancerous those mobs often are even at 60.
---
Nobody commenting on engineering and enchanting as professions while leveling... no gathering to support engineering AND no g from selling greens. That's asking to not have money to train, let alone afford a mount.
---
It wasn't a BOE, it was a BOP that vendor for about 3g. Like I mentioned, it's not really about the 3g its just about him being an overall douche.
---
^ this is the real answer. 
---
You can bet this player right here is running the show on his server. [He’s massively a big deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbyazy/didnt_even_ask_for_water_yet/f24rvke/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
And now for our DPS anthem 
---
https://youtu.be/97xfV6yXcrk
---
Yea definitely.   Your can’t miss or be resisted which is why tanks/do’s all have to be the right level but you don’t
---
FOMO is very real in our dear classic community.
---
A good idea is to make stance conditional macros.  For example, make it so you execute binding will work normally for battle or berserker but in def stance it will first swap you to berserker and execute with 1 button.  Same for things like overpower, so you can react while in zerker and immediately swap and overpower with 1 key press.  Or a combat conditional so when out of combat when you press the button it will put you in battle and charge with 1 press.  I'm on my phone now so I can't copy paste my macros, but it is a huge boost in efficiency and making the class fluid to learn conditional macros.
---
Well if you feel like it's taking forever then either 
---
A) stick it out because lvl 44 is the halfway point to 60 in classic
---
B) reroll now to a hunter or mage which are the fastest leveling classes
---
What's the worst that could happen? It's so bad that you have to leave the group and spend another 2 minutes to get whispered by randoms that need a tank for that same instance?
---
This is what they don't seem to get. Food and water are a major benefit of having a mage and a good reason to bring one. Imagine a warlock charging the healer to put up a soulstone, or the healer charging per heal or whatever. So stupid.
---
The Deadmines is an 18+ dungeon. It's a mine with no minors.
---
I love you.
---
I love you both
---
Man, wearing thar rig would be heavy af.
---
Healers don't really have a "level restriction" on dungeons. If a group will take you as a 48 priest, then you can heal it.
---
The only reason that a group may *not* take you is because of your aggro radius as a level 48.
---
Also, you're going to be restricted to the earlier parts of the dungeon I would say. I don't think you will be able to find a group for a full dungeon clear as a 48 priest.
---
Engineering is great on paladins and great in PvP. 
---
However, alchemy seems cooler so I’d do that. I’m sure there’d be some benefit to an alch on a premade, like cheaper potions
---
Balance is prettu good. About 80% of the day time the server maintains medium pop. I like it here

I was under the impression that EVERY WEAPON IS A HUNTER WEAPON!!??

Until mara Id charge&gt;ss&gt;whirlwind and berserker rage&gt; defensive. Gave me good aggro. Then id just shout, sunder, revenge, swap.
---
46 ret paladin. Have been told cant join several groups because lolret damage.
---
Funny thing tho, im always top or very close to top dps on single target.
---
Yes.  It's not a ton, but can keep up to hold aoe threat at the cost of single Target if you spam it
---
Alright I found a slightly faster way to get to Winterspring from Org, and I've been wanting to share this borderline useless info with someone haha. 
---
If you fly to Azshara from Org, then fly to Winterspring you shave off something like 30s from your flight time. 
---
Might cost you more, not sure, but time is money and all that.
---
Is there any way to transfer characters?
---
All of my "We're gonna play classic wow, play with us" friends fucking quit.
---
Theres a free xfer avilable but my friends who do play aren't on any of the available servers to xfer too, even though their server isn't high population. 
---
Is there a way to pay for an Xfer or anything?
---
&gt; As a friendly reminder: Back in classic it was common courtesy to give the orbs to the tanks because they cannot farm anything on their own.
---
LOL, what?  I've never heard this before, and it sure as hell wasn't how things were done on my vanilla server.  Maybe it was on yours, but don't act like it was some universal thing back then.
---
15 min pom pyro videos?
---
Ive wanted to fear a mage aoe pack for the lols so bad but none of them slighted me and were already there farming first before me so i didn't lol
---
I don't see a problem.  Im not on either server though. I do like to watch asmon guild drama, its hilarious.  Have i gave him money?  Absolutely not. Would i join his Hoard giuld? I dont know. It might be fun.  But the other guy McConnell? Cant stand him. So probably not. 
---
He did state that even if they level on Herod hes going to be playing on his Alliance server %99.9 of the time. So i doubt its going to be a real issue
---
I feel the standard UI is more intuitive. Also, if she decides to play elsewhere then everything will be wonky.
---
That 18 slot bag will probably be nice even at later phases. Who's got time to grind for all bottomless and/or onyxia's?

Oh didnt realize that, then yeah that's douchy!

Hey congrats Ligmah! You’re in my guild, this is Peanutbutter!

Auctionator I think, auctioneer has a little more info on the bottom of the item’s tooltip
---
I played a Ret Paladin in Vanilla, don't do it. It's extremely boring and all you do is cast seals and occassional judgements and are waiting for large seal procs aka waiting for a big auto attack.
---
Leveing Warriors can be dull, but it's still engaging enough. You have to cast certain skill sets to be engaged.
---
Paladins just just have better survival because of their spells, but their attacking is abysmally boring.

Being a cool dude also helps, karma never fails

Yup, jist is just be sure you really want to do something before you do it.
---
Alliance on Blaumeux. It's pretty 50/50 on this server, I feel like I'd have the same experience as a dirty horde if that's what I rolled.
---
which addon does that?
---
You absolutely can and should play whatever you want, and yea anybody with a pulse can clear molten core, but ret paladins, boomkins etc will not get raid spots in guilds clearing AQ and Naxx efficiently. I'm a ret pally fanatic myself, but unlike most I know my place is in the battleground/world pvp and that I am a healer in a raid setting.
---
How can I customize where player icons are?
---
Resto druids are perfectly fine.
---
Let me know when the Boomkin in your guild gets the most epics on the server.
---
I’m on Benediction also. I was in a SM group and we had a mage rolling need in every single BoE. Yes they were all greens but it’s still BS.
---
Well if your focused on raids then no suppression doesn't have a large impact since shadow bolt is not affliction, but you will have opportunities to use corruption on trash etc. I personally don't bother with any more than 3 points into suppression so I would use the second build you linked. Basically the 3/5 supp covers pvp due to pvp hit cap, and then extra points into imp CoE is also more of a pvp focused decision. So it really comes down to if you want that slight bonus in pvp or pve. Realistically they will both function nearly the same so you really aren't going to shoot yourself in the foot or something and need to re spec
---
There's currently no way to do a paid transfer, however I imagine that Blizzard will soon release it. (They probably still won't allow transfers to extremely high pop though)
---
On the offchance that they don't though for a while, it might be worth starting to level an alt on your friend's server.
---
Would you possibly be able to share your current talent build? I'm thinking of a 21/25/5 build ive sketched up, I think it could be pretty decent for holy fire / smite and wanding... Ill have to test first of course https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMusV0oZoxtccbVZx
---
can i cantact a GM or some shit? is there an ETA for paid transfers to be implimented?
---
Fellow Arugal Hordie here.
---
Congrats!
---
I'm currently planning on getting a raptor as my first 100% mount too (also an orc). I'm curious, did you buy the Runecloth or farm it? If the former, how much gold did you sink?
---
Gaaaaaaatorade
---
As a mage I am sorry for what I have done, but honestly we know we are pulling aggro and dont care and also half the groups you join WANT you to aoe and pull aggro cause its still quicker and if the mage isn't special hell be right anyways, freezes, blocks.
---
&gt; he said “this is an easy dungeon, there’s no reason to be try hard”
---
How do these people get dressed in the morning if they don't understand that putting on zero cost buffs/handing out water/otherwise playing the game properly will result in much *faster* runs?
---
I fully admit I'm a bit of a hardarse when I run raids/dungeons. Do what I fucking tell you or I'll replace you... but all I tell you to do is buff up, let the tank pull, give them 3-4 seconds *after they have all the mobs* so that they have aggro, and let the healer set the pace. Other than that let's just have some fun! I'm only so strict about it because when people *don't* do that shit, things are less fun, more stressful, involve wipes, and take longer.
---
Easily my biggest peeve are people ignoring requests from tanks or healers to slow down. Even if the tank can run in and get all the mobs off you, even if the healer can manage to heal that stupid pull you just made, even if it all works out ok? You are actively making the run less fun and more stressful for those players, so don't fucking do it.
---
Anyway, post probably makes me sound like a prick but at the end of my runs people are always super happy at how well things went and thanking everyone/adding friends/seeing who wants to go again. So I'm sure as hell not gonna stop!
---
There is no such thing as bad publicity.
---
Here here!
---
Fuck you mage, did he charge you to tank the dungeon?
---
Leaves just enough space in the pelvic region
---
Wait you like.. play? You don't sit at the starting area and just wait to magically level? Fucking tryhard.
---
KAAAAAAAAAAMEEEEEEEEEEE-
---
oh ok ty
---
Tier 1 raids are simple. Next raid has an early boss notorioisly known as the guild breaker. It will not be so simple for most to clear. And being stuck on the second boss of a raid is not good for morale.
---
After that it only gets harder
---
If I’m in a dungeon that I’ve run for the 10th time and my BiS drops and someone needs it for gold, that is the only ninja.
---
If someone in your group has done their part to contribute, they deserves that boe. There’s going to be 100 other drops at least before something of that caliber drops again.
---
what's the different between a casual and lets say a "hardcore" server?
---
You hate us cuz you ain’t us
---
What you doing there anyway?
---
i mean i told my guild and they are pretty big so hopefully it spreads
---
Honestly it's because you're a mage. My main had been a rogue since day one and it's only when I play my alts that I remember how fucking awful your average rogue can actually be.
---

Arathi-&gt;menethil is a very lucrative flight path same with menethil-&gt; IF so they get the prime gryphons while IF-arathi  doesnt bring in the big money like all the flight to a boat would bring in.
---
It's all about the economics
---
I will admit though that alot of mages dont understand how to aoe properly, If I pull aggro ill still kite them in a pack next to the tank when they are slowed and frozen and a second later they are dead anyways
---
I have no idea what you're talking about, I don't watch any streamers, especially not the idiots that seem to make up the wow base.  I just know that nothing's going to hold off sweeping strikes with the defensive stance bonus threat
---
with that mindset u cant lvl yes
---
Agreed, always ask first and wait for an answer and let them trade you.
---
Which addon is automatically accepting quests and not allowing me to read it? 
---
I use 
---
ClassicCodex
---
Questie
---
QuestLog Extended 
---
NeatPlates
---
Classic Threat Meter 
---
Azeroth Autopilot (disabled)
---
I think it’s Questie but I cannot find which setting is automatically accepting/completing and closing out quest text. 
---
Does anyone know how to fix it?
---
It actually does if they speak in chat, lol. You can right click their name and add a note :P
---
All the vanilla hunters rolled mage or warrior
---
Few hundred hours in one month?
---
you are the kind of player that cries to reddit when getting owned by a mage
---
Spell batching is important for classic pvp gameplay authenticity. Especially for rogues that have some unique spell batching tricks in pvp. It's not a matter of what is fun or what people like. It's a matter of what is authentic to the original vanilla experience.
---
Why are the elemental fires specifically worth a lot of money now? On Bigglesworth I saw them go for about 3g a piece. But the elemental air and water are normally priced at around 11s a piece.
---
classiccodex, go under interface and click the addons tab
---
Retails combat is faster and better bc of this no doubt
---
And you call me a living trope. Leftist smart
---
To be fair, if the tank is just about to pull and you're asking for an int buff, there's no way I'd give it since it costs around a quarter of my total mana and I'd go OOM for sure before I have time to drink again.
---
I'm not him but I can give it a shot.
---
Basically your opener is all about burst threat. The first few seconds of any pull are always the most important, and in the meta we're in for classic, threat is a real issue (as we know), and you really need to cement yourself at the top from the start. Early rage is precious. Due to the way you need to over-aggro by a certain percent to pull aggro, losing threat on mobs makes it really hard to get them back. Not getting hit means lacking rage for abilities, means you lose other mobs, lose more rage,, fewer abilities, lose more threat etc etc. You get stuck in a harsh cycle that's almost impossible to recover from, especially with DPS running away from you and a resisted taunt.
---
The problem with Thunderclap is that it's a mitigation tool, not a threat-building one. It doesn't provide much threat compared to your other abilities, and is further reduced by Battle Stance's -20% threat mod. 
---
Also the fact that TC scales with pack size. Smaller packs aren't really worth using it on since the mitigation is low, and in large packs, you can't really tank anyway. Your mage or other big AoE'ers will be tanking, and you're just there to slow and try to grab whatever you can. TC could help there, buuuut the mages should be kiting at range, and the mobs should be moving slow via their Imp Blizzard or your Piercing Howl, so TC's slower attack speed isn't actually doing much as the mobs shouldn't be hitting a kiting mage. That would be the best time to use it though, as you're more of a utility for DPS than a tank at that point.
---
The best thing you can do for threat in dungeon pulls is something like Charge -&gt; 1 auto -&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; Whirlwind, then into Defensive Stance for Demo Shout and Cleave or Sunder spam, depending on pack size, swapping back to Berserker for each WW.
---
If you want to TC, then the best time to do it would be either after your big WW opener before Def Stance, or after Demo Shout and then into TC and back to Def Stance. It's kinda awkward though and I think it's not usually needed.
---
Sly Marbo
---
Right my bad, wrote that on my phone while tired.
---
Defense to get the actual avoidance stats is a nice to have stat. If there's enough of it on an item, like on DB legs, then that can be decent. But if you fully gear for it, you not only lose out on other possible tankstats like more stam, but also lose out on threat, not just on pure threatgear.
---
If one looks at Golem Skull Cap e.g the defense is a nice bonus. 0.28% Parry, dodge miss is a nice bonus on top of 18 Stam and Strength as well as decent armor - even as a mitigation item it's great, on top of providing a good bunch of threat, too, whereas an item like Deathbone Sabatons has...Defense and Stam, meaning it's a pure 100% mitigation boost.
---
Most people get 440 defense because they think it's necessary, which is dumb. Even with mitigation gear you can a nice amount of threat, too, is basically my point, while also saying that the cap's completely irrelevant outside of Patchwerk and Sapph.
---
People should make sure to get Hitcap, then get mitigationpieces and swap *those* out as necessary, whereas I see people running around in full Deathbone, Golem Skull and other defense gear for no reason other than reaching that 440 cap it seems. 
---
Also it's 1.1 Vanilla; You have a ton of healers whose job it is to keep you alive in very short raid encounters; You'll be fine without being an absolute wall, whereas you're only lengthening fights if you don't wear threatgear.
---
That's basically my point put out somewhat better, I hope. Thanks for the correction!
---
can do about 15 minutes of retail levelling but on classic I had to force myself to take breaks.
---
Retail levelling is boring because there's no element of risk. You just aoe pull and kill everything in a few seconds, nothing ever of note drops because any boe is essentially vendor trash unless it has a specific transmog value.
---
In the end the vanilla experience won't be for everyone, there's no shame in not liking it.
---
Only curse of shadows or shadow vulnerability will increase dmg
---
I got cold rage dagger on my hunter on the first since no one wanted I took it. On my rogue, only time will tell
---
I’m sure saying that will help you when you’re getting ganked in Blackrock Mountain and can’t enter the raid
---
Lol trying so hard.
---
Nah, it's on Grobbulus
---
I rolled a druid fro. The get go for this very reason
---
see formula for crit below.. TL;DR: human warr with edgemaster has: +1.28% crit (+28 from edgemaster) and no change to hit chance (5%). 
---
    BaseAttackRating = MIN(PlayerLevel*5, AttackRating)  If the target is a mob and BaseAttackRating minus TargetDefense is less than 0:     CritChance = AttackerCrit + (BaseAttackRating - TargetDefense) * 0.2%  If the target is a mob and BaseAttackRating minus TargetDefense is above or equal to 0:     CritChance = AttackerCrit + (BaseAttackRating - TargetDefense) * 0.04%
---
I felt this, then I did the math. 300 hours is 12.5 days. I believe him on that lol
---
I mean.. sunder and revenge are more or less static threat values while shield slam and HS scale so.. yeah.
---
It's mostly just that mages and their AOE farming presents an opportunity for them to be an ass, and you remember it. It's certainly not all, or even most mages- and I think most players know that. 
---
I've had mages randomly give me water when I'm on my Pally, and the run-by buffs are always welcome.  When I'm on my mage I do the same, and I always start off dungeons by giving everyone food and water. (always have extra prepared, sucks to try to do it on the spot)
---
I'm with you that we should all have a good time and have fun- and I'd say 95% or more of my interactions have been great. There's always a few jerks in whatever you do- don't let it ruin your enjoyment of the class or game.
---
Or join a guild noob
---
unless ofc, you are a warrior that knows how to  queue up your heroic strikes ;)
---
Shouting is for Warriors.
---
You can't pvp in contested zones unless you flag yourself
---
nope, we all use 6% now ;)
---
to leave\*
---
I mean there's a lot of census data showing the worst favored server is like 53/47. Horde favored. There are simply more horde players in the world.  Also people have taken counts of deaths playing an ally and horde 1-60 and horde have much less deaths. Yes they do still die, but it was significantly less. 
---
You are the one generalizing your personal bias and acting like a spastic... if you don't believe me pick any pvp server, level 1-60 on either faction without dungeon grinding. Then delete the toon and do it again on opposite faction as the same class. You are going to be shocked at how much worse it actually is...
---
Yikes.
---
By sitting under the stairs selling cockroaches.
---
Give yourself side goals like levelling professions or grinding some rep.
---
I got friendly with timbermaw killing things in winterspring and that basically got me 70% of a level at 58
---
Thank you. I did not know this. This explains why warrior tanks seem to take so much damage when I'm healing.
---
As a healer, sometimes warriors just seem to take more damage than i think they should. This would explain it.
---
Just curious regarding the tactical mastery part. My question is why? I was arms while tanking RFK now I am fury because I wanted to see how it was while tanking dungeons and my plan is to go fury prot at 60, do I figured why not start now (I'm level 35). What I miss is having charge then switching to defensive stage and starting with rage. Is that what you mean?  
---
I am a tank that sunders though. But I also don't have that problems unless I don't initiate the fight or the mobs are red and my abilities keep missing.
---
God damnit dude
---
You’ll only get 10% of the normal rep gain if you are over leveled though.
---
Was anyone reading this and thinking about Goku transforming into SSJ3?
---
Is there anything I can do to spice up the Warlock leveling experience? I really like their concept and class fantasy but casting Immolate &gt; Corruption &gt; Curse &gt; wand to death while voidwalker tanks gets a little old.
---
For your and her sake I hope you have better lighting than that in the room.
---
This is a great way to strain your eyes.
---
If you forgot to grab water with NO MAGE in your group, yeah that’s an oopsie on you. If YOU HAVE A MAGE then you shouldn’t even need to care about water and as soon as you zone in, ask for some water. If they refuse to give out water I would replace them. Dungeons are a teamwork and if you can’t help the team by buffing or giving them water/healthstones, then you should not be in that dungeon. 
---
As a mage I can easily say the only reason a mage would refuse someone water when in a party is because they are either oom and drinking to make you water after or you are in combat and they should not waste mana in combat for food. The only other reason is because they’re a dick. Get THAT trash out of your group asap to avoid a lot more drama then mage water drama.
---
I’m a little sad when I see 2-5s and blown away when I see 30+. I honestly try to expect nothing because I’m doing it to build skill which is probably more worth it to me than whatever is in that box is to them. But of course, on a deeper level, I do expect something and I think 10-25s is fair. Also more for bigger boxes and less for smaller.
---
best tanking pets are owls or carrion birds due to their screech ability.
---
Watched a level 56 mage win the blade last night. All the other 60 mages were pissed lol
---
to add onto this. There's no real definitive answer for current content. But from AQ onwards you start getting so much raw attack power that you can safely start ignoring the white hit crit cap and just go max crit+str with 6% hit and it will be worth it.
---
Easy when you're the only druid in raid and get everything auto looted
---
having played both sides considerably id disagree.
---
horde is more likely to allow 1v1s in the open world. but more likely to attack you outright.
---
alliance is more likely to quest beside you. but more likely to attack you when they have an advantage or outnumber you.

possible the most safe for work nsfw content ever
---
Everyone gets bored of their rotation at one point, no matter what class they play. It's repetitive for everyone. You just have to duke it out until more spells become learned and changes your rotation slightly up.
---
Oh wow that's really good. I initially played rogue and switched to warlock. Guess I haven't faced a troll priest yet on the lock but I was truly scared of them on the rogue because I would just stun lock myself
---
Tagged a quest mob first, this guy loses his mind.

As long as you know how to sheep and single target the skull you're okay.

---
So typing into a chat box to speak privately to another character doesn't break immersion... But the words inside the chat box just shatters it?
---
Edit: phrasing
---
Thanks for the tips! Gonna just keep doin me. Any further advice on how to make sure my tank has enough aggro before I start AOE? I’ve only done a dungeon run once so far, and I just used single target on the person my tank was focusing, then used AOE when the other mage did... I’ve been asking any people who pass by when I AOE farm if they are cool with me pulling a pack and leaving them the ones on the side, hope that’s a good way to do it.
---
I definitely was a bit angry when I wrote the post because I have been playing for a while (low level due to low skill and time to invest) and tonight was my first time experiencing assholes, and it was a few times in an hour.
---
That's because it's a rip off.
---
Depends on your guild. Can you tank in anything close to a semi-hardcore setting like that? No... Pugs? No.. Semi-Casual guild? Sure.
---
I think it’s hilarious there is a server called blow me
---
Resto/bal for high spirit and nat shapeshifter, plus an innervate, you can keep going indefinitely.
---
My favorite from today was my Uld run, with two mages who ran up and CoCd every group I pulled (making the mobs turn to the clothies who are now in melee), and the Spriest who spammed Mind Blast and ran away from me when he ripped aggro off me.
---
I already stopped tanking for plate dps because there's a tank shortage and they can just put on a damn shield, I'm seriously considering a blanket ban on tanking for cloth dps (except warlocks, because they dont seem to exist).
---
i haven't seen druids in ages
---
but being prot/holy does seem to be paying off, i can get into any dungeon at any time
---
More like Re-Post Malone, amirite?
---
Someone posted a pic of a dwarf with it a week or so ago.
---
Not a great idea, you may want to go defensive during pvp to simply disarm, and swapping weapons also resets ur swing timer (as in you now need to wait the full weapon swing time duration before ur next hit)
---
Once every 5min while requiring enough mops to be close around to pull them all together and forcing you to eat or bandage after. And to unlock it you have to spend a bunch of points in worthless talents in leveling phase. Expertise is only good for lvl 60 and Aggression is garbage.
---
I mean, that's well and good and all, but I'm probably getting invited to at least twice as many groups as you are because I've only got 21 points in resto and 20 in feral, so I'm able to efficiently hold threat and actually tank dungeons. That was the point of my post. The increases you get from going deep resto are actually numerically marginal, so instead of constantly respeccing between tanking and healing, you can just have a hybrid build that does both.
---
I am so happy I’m not on US realms, I bet having to deal with streamers and even worse, they’re cult is very annoying I would assume.
---
Actually I’ve noticed quite a consistent difference. The only time horde attack me or want to fight me are when I’m at half health or less, drinking/eating, fighting 2 or more mobs, 15 levels below said attacking horde player or if it’s a group of 3 or more horde against just me. Or a combination of two or more of the above.
---
It’s working as intended yes.
---
I also read your original post from earlier.   Sorry to hear what happened but there isn't anything you can do besides trying to appeal the ban.
---
Besod that, nothing else you can do but wait really.  But time will pass and before you know it you'll be playing with is again.  :)
---
Hit up some Borderlands 3 while you wait, hang out here in the forums and keep your chin up.
---
Appreciate the info
---
You’re malding
---
Perhaps on your server. There are several people with it in the world. I've seen two people with it on my server (Gehennas EU).
---
I played Vanilla from release until the end of WotLK. I never got a blue BoE until level 66. I still haven't seen a BoE purple. Some people just get excited for it.
---
Can we not publicly ashame these people? Name + realm? Or is it against this subreddit's rules?
---
If you are an orc and want to go dw fury at 60 I would do it. It's about 200g on my server
---
Can you clarify what exactly happened?
---
Quest was bit easy, only had to respec and get some stuff, i used some un'goro grenades and potions.  
---
I farmed eye of shadow for about 5 hours with a friend, he had to go to sleep and used HS, i killed one succubus on my own and it dropped hahahah
---
I saw a Human Mage with it 2 weeks ago on Mograine EU.
---
I went for DD
---
best looking benediction
---
Heartseeker is the complete opposite in my experience unfortunately
---
NeatPlates, while not specifically for rogues, has a very clean combo point display built in. I’d imagine other nameplate addons might have something similar.
---
You don't even need a shadow priest to do that. We have one of our priests go for shadow weaving and then disc/holy.
---
Ya. Not really lol.
---
I got mine last night too off a 97 roll (shadow priest)
---
If you haven't tagged it, it's not your mob.
---
Only for Dreamscythe and Weaver. Morphaz and Hazzas are always there, on the way to Eranikus.
---
Don’t forget the cheese
---
I will have a go on the technicalities:
---
You press the key for «frostbolt».
---
Your computer sends a message to the server, starts the casting animation and cast bar.
---
If you abort the spell just before it's finished the I ASSUME that your computer gets a message from the server saying that the spell is completed. If you cancel it too early then the cancel-message arrives to the server before it sends it's «spell is complete»-message to your computer.
---
It is not abuse but combating lag.
---
You can try this with other things. E.g: start mounting and just before the «casting» is done press forward button. Perhaps not entirely the same thing but close.
---
Fuck this reserve culture that's started.
---
Most times for me lockboxes are 30s value - even at 20% seems low to me. 
---
Maybe i’m generous but 35-50% on boxes seems like a non-issue to me. Unless it drops an epic then i’d just trade them 5G and give a big hug haha.
---
It's. Even like that aloooooog time
---
Wana know how to not be a douchebag mage? Dont charge for water and food that costs you nothing. Let people know if you are AOE farming and there are alot of people around you (seriously takes 2 seconds). And dont try charging absurd amounts of money for ports. Oh and dont ever make an excuse for not giving out buffs to party members (yes it does happen quit abit).  From your post seems like you are one of the few good mages out there keep it up.
---
Since classic I didn‘t see a single hunter ninjas anything. I saw a lot of rogues rolling for leather with int on it against druids and hunters tough
---
I'm glad you can just sit there and grind, I pan the camera around like I'm a gd paranoid schizophrenic when I'm playing.
---
Wow tokens kills classic. Literally instantly.
---
I mean you get less xp since mobs you have to kill are green
---
As An european player i don't indestand the negativity about this. He's actually does wide events on the realms he plays on. Massive PVP brawls/trying to capture opposite faction capital, ...
---
It's all positieve world PVP events on a pvp realm. It's not that he's corpse camping entire zones (which i het he could do with his Massive following). 
---
I for one would roll on a realm which such a huge streamer BASE. 
---
The only negative is maybe an increase of queue
---
Because they are feeling out the class to see if they want to commit to it.
---
No it’s a very low value blue, 1.5g on my server max
---
Join a guild to not get chat channel invites guys. This man is a genius.
---
Oh wise one, thankyou for this assistance.
---
I'd like to see your reasoning
---
Honestly as a mage here I'm not gonna defend those individuals actions but... Just open a trade window to the mage instead of whispering if you're already in the same group.
---
Aw shoot :( I've searched around for any evidence of other players having it before embarrassing myself lmao. How long ago?
---
On my server, you can make money by buying greater magic essence and making greater magic wands to vendor.  The essence auctioned for 13-14s
---
Yup, seems like BRD is the spot.  I've run what seems like countless ZF runs, and it was fun, but i was really hoping there'd be more Mara groups so I wouldn't have to try to grind normal mobs as a tank.  It's basically like, kill one mob, sit, kill one mob, sit, kill one mob, sit.  And I'm supposed to do that for 4 levels...
---
Oh, we were talking about different things. You were talking about people wasting their gold buying stuff on the AH. What I meant is quest rewards and vendor trash alone don't net you anywhere near 100 gold (at least not after you've bought the skills you need to keep going), so you would have to sell stuff on the AH as well to hit 100g by 40. Except only really boes are selling for any decent amount right now.
---
I didnt put his name?
---
Edit: I'm dumb, misunderstood your post. Lol Sorry I play a warrior.
---
I've had pleasant interactions with most of their members I've met, but I've heard they've got some internal strife at the moment.
---
People say ret does low damage, but I always see ret pallies pulling good numbers
---
I guess they scale off when other classes get better gear or something?
---
You can remove the S as well. You should never end up backtracking when you can just turn around.
---
Stunlock them to death. Pretty much your only option
---
Man lots of EU players saying they seen him already.
---
I looked for any posts about it previous to making this video but couldn't find any &gt;.&lt;
---
theyre basically the same, dominos is just faster/easier to use
---
I appreciate the poor man’s award 😘
---
This is the real disadvantage to faction imbalance. If you're outnumbered there's a good chance at least 1 edgelord is gonna jump on you, and that's a green light for the rest of the zone to come clap you for defending yourself
---
VW: Mezzthang
---
Link or you're full of bullshit, theres a direct link to a GM convo on the other thread that says it's permitted.
---
Don't hold your breath snowflake.
---
im actually arms/fury.
---
Its just with the stats on the shield, i actually do more damage with a 1hand then a 2hand
---
Horde = hold my hand mommy.
---
He is clearly collecting his ~~Infinity Stones~~ Ret BiS so he can respec to Ret.
---
 Heard it right. The highly coveted minmaxed perfectly optimized Ret!  
---
That still underperforms the "working" DPS specs. X,D
---
A friend of mine put it best some years ago:  
---
Alliance is the harmonic place of law and order. The typical good guys. Every single parent gamer, casual and carebear will gravitate towards this faction.  
---
Horde is edge and aggression. Tryhards, teenagers, Gankers, Edgelords - those gravitate there.  
---
This was when we were discussing the imbalance of PvP. Both of us agreeeing that Horde side wins BGs way more than alliance, except for Alterac. Sure Humans have the overpowered pvp racial (later, not in Classic right now) but for the sole sake of knowing the Horde is and always will be stronger at PvP I cannot imagine going Alliance with any kind of pvp centered character.
---
I got to use Windfury as an Arms Warrior for the first time the other day. I miss Paladins and the Alliance but I regret nothing..
---
meh if i get ganked i get ganked. Unless my corpse gets camped, it doesnt really bother me
---
As a mage I do buff everyone I can and hand out water, because I create some after every time I drink to full. That mana used on most expensive water just regents while I am moving to next pull. And I have plenty of time to make some more once we wait looking for a tank.
---
Yikes, you ok?
---
I yearn for an Overlord / Warcraft crossover, change my mind:p.
---
Thank you, mate!
---
So I installed a bunch of new addons and not a single one shows up. It looks like I’ve done everything right, the same way I did my previous addons that worked just fine. All addons are extracted into the Classic WoW &gt; interface &gt; addons folder. 
---
I have no idea why they aren’t working. I’ve relaunched the program, restarted my computer, replaced the files. Idk what else to do.
---
&gt; This dismounts, cancels any non-cat form, cast cat form, and then casts prowl from single click.
---
This one won't work from a mount, it dismounts me and then says I'm not in cat form. Any ideas?
---
Thanks for the list, super helpful!
---
"true classic experience"? I used a custom UI back in the days of classic... so what exactly is the "true classic experience"?
---
Just inside my head :P
---
Yep
---
18 gold and a mount? Or...
---
It really is BS, but Classic design is all over the place...
---
and just now I got a quest to DM:E :   Shards of the Felvine
---
You sound like you play an Herbalist Tauren.
---
Yeah, I actually rolled up a tank because of the huge demand, and now it occurs to me I could probably sell my services that way.
---
You always have to grind.
---
To make matters worse, that Paladin will very quickly rack up 100g respec costs just for the ability to grind (and utilise that HoJ.)
---
You don't replace WW with Ravager and Bonebiter is an alliance only weapon. Ravager is only good for AOE dungeon grinding.
---
The only time it ever bothers me is when I trade it water to every caster, and someone just goes “more”. Usually it’s no big issue, but if I just got a new rank of conjure water and  am making 2 at a time, it’s a real bitch
---
Dude just cast the lower rank on randos. They way rather have that than nothing, and you can easily spare the mana.
---
That's some chaos in the deeprun tram right there xD (it is there no?) it looks like the entrance-
---
Also any addon that combines bags into one. I think few things are more confusing for a new player than having to click thru several bags to find some item. Edit: why the downvotes? Try combuctor, the bag still looks pretty but it's so amazing you will seriously never ever be able to not use it.
---
We only use 2 debuff slots though?
---
Obviously we would assume everyone is max level by now.
---
If you look under the addons window in menu, are they listed under there?
---
Nobody is saying either of those things are bad. They're honestly the better parts of Alliance PvP wise, but I'd say that the anti-CC racials tend to win out over mitigation every time, see the countless years of bitching about Every Man for Himself when it was added. Stoneform is kind of niche anyhow, good against rogues, okay for some extra mitigation, but that's about it. 
---
Furthermore, going back to the original post you replied to, you seem to only be considering premade group scenarios, and not world encounters or anything. An alliance warlock is not going to have fear ward when wandering about the world outside unless they have a dwarven priest friend tagging along. Meanwhile, EVERY undead you find has WotF by virtue of being undead. The two aren't really comparable.
---
He is a gamer but I don’t think he played WoW. Post is his last name, he says he put his name into a name generator online and Post Malone is what came out.
---
I am also Alliance on Blaumeux and I am not sure I would agree.  I see horde camping the entrance to BRD almost 24/7.  They seem way more active in wPvP too.
---
again didn't read this but you're still going on defending some streamer lmao
---
Dress riiiiiiiiiiiiight
---
Ya'll cracking me up
---
That as well. Have that for her also.
---
Mobs are everywhere... If you want to pull multiple or accidentally pull multiple you can easily get SnD going off opener, pop evasion, blade flurry and AR and deal with it instead of vanishing and reseting.
---
And expertise is still pretty solid for leveling if you're doing dungeons or fighting mobs higher level then you. 
---
Also not really sure how bandaging is a factor considering it takes like 5 seconds to bandage if you have your FA up to snuff and either way you're gonna have to end up bandaging after a few mobs anyway. It's not like you can talent into self heal/sustain instead. 
---
Leveling isn't about min maxing or going cookie cutter it's about finding what works for you. Personally AR has turned situations to my favor a couple times in PVE and PVP situations and has definitely earned it's place for me. Lots of people don't like riposte either but I find it to be extremely helpful.
---
Run with a druid. They just innervate you back up and zoom zoom.
---
Yea I know. I’m just saying the resemblance is uncanny. I’m a huge posty fan and even from the DFW area
---
Yea we are and it does not feel great hehe. 
---
I can imagine that’s why they changed it as the years went by.
---
Rage is a non issue in retail for example. Meaning you don’t have to think about it cause you are always in rage.
---
I think the rage starve is the reason arms is not considered a warrior raid spec.
---
And that’s the reason I actually try to get aggro when I dps as arms in dungeons;)
---
This video is 3 1/2 weeks old.
---
Half the que time, half the chance to win the BG.
---
Our servers must be so different. I’m a healer and I’ve done Mara so many times that I’m completely sick of it. Good thing I’m 54 and don’t have any reason to ever go back there.
---
It's because you are using the same griffin. He gets more tired the farther he flies, and therefore costs more.
---
RIP Vine. I still miss the funny little laughs it gave us, like this.
---
A user linked to a website in another comment in which you can search for reserved names. Thanatos is on that, so it may not be copyright then idk.
---
It is bis for the druid as well, plus ferals are perfectly viable in raids both as tanks and DPS. I really don't see your complaint.
---
He could also be popping a free action potion?? Maybe just hp and healthstone.
---
Ye warlocks have two instant fears
---
This doesn’t show any loot rules being discussed, for all we know, that item was res for that guy
---
This is a popular place to level lockpicking up to 175 amongst all alliance races. What does it have to do with your racial ability?
---
DW shines when you get lot of +hit late game. However, I would argue that there is a case for dual wield arms between 21 and 30. 
---
The idea is that the only good thing about the spec at that point is improved overpower. How do you get it to proc more often? Hit it with two weapons! Using a slow main hand and a fast off hand and you can often just keep spamming overpower on cd.
---
After lv 30 you get sweeping strikes so a slow 2h will be preferred, especially an axe since orc (but only slightly, +axe skill mostly helps with enemies 2-3lv higher). But don't forget to look at other weapon types, especially staves which often have high damage. The higher the weapon damage (not dps) the better, especially once you get instant attacks such as whirlwind and mortal strike.
---
I don't understand these people
---
If I attack in a group its cause your killing mobs I need, resource war and all. My experience with Alliance has been exactly like you said. They don’t often outnumber us but i’ve found that if I end up around 5 Alliance its best to just kill as many before they turn on you.
---
Zero chances they let me rock on. Sometimes I get cool Allies and we help each other kill shit and stay alive.. even had a Ally Mage polymorph me and punch me in the head at full health to break it - that was an awesome experience as a Warrior.
---
yeah really "lol"
---
The "ignore me again" and he already had was just. too much lol
---
I hate mages more every day
---
I love how he’s raiding
---
Sorry but looting their BiS doesn’t make them an ass.
---
As palatank it cost me around 10g to buy water for a BRD run. I stopped joining groups without a mage.
---
This is why you never join a PUG (especially one started by a guild) and expect loot out of it. Unless they leave it up to normal group looting rules...but that's never going to happen.
---
You only need 3 tanks during this phase maybe.  AQ40 will require 4-5 tanks at times, Naxx will shoot up to 8 for Horsemen.  Legit raid guilds know this, and will be preparing for it long before that content is released.  All these DPS Warriors who think they will only be a DPS in raids will have one hell of a rude awakening someday when they are rocking the bench in favor of another DPS Warrior who actually has tank gear in their bags and knows how to use it.
---
But how would they have kept the game interesting? They do need to add some sort of sense of change and progression to keep things from being stale.
---
Even private servers do have that with everyone waiting for the bugs messing with their class or progression to get fixed. XD
---
Heh. Heh. Aaaall riiiiight.

Damnit u/Anton_O! Stop allowing Asmon to do things!  You're 100% responsible for everything he does!
---
I don't see the purpose of going to Stormwind already at level 1. Just spamming warlocks with begs to get summoned. Lol
---
Thats why you port to tb.
---
Stop posting about me thx
---
While I agree that food/water should be provided to group mates at no cost. However, I'm not going to stop what I'm doing, while I'm in the middle of something, just to make you food and water just because it's free to make. You're going to have to pay up an inconvenience fee. Paying someone for a buff is crazy.
---
Then why offer it up for rolling if it was previously discussed and/or reserved?
---
thx man
---
Uhh that dagger does +healing as well. That's a priest weapon either spec...
---
Higher weapon skill! Idk I just noticed it around then that I don’t miss as much.
---
Thats what I usually yell out too
---
Yeah at 60 they get hurt by scaling. However, they’re still fine and not deadweight at all, they just need to use their support abolities to help out im other ways. It’s sad that the dps fall-off at 60 stigma presents itself during earlier lvling dungeons. People just don’t understand the game enough and jump on the meta bandwagon.
---
Hunters barely have any loot between 20 and 50. It's downright abysmal. 
---
Sensibly rolling in dungeons means you never get any loot what-so-ever, which ultimately means as Hunters progress to higher dungeons even shit loot are massive upgrades for them.
---
My Hunter alt survives on my main's leatherworking. Without it I would be running around in level 13 pants still.
---
Rock and stone brother!!

They stole my name smh

---
Alliance on PvP servers is easy mode. More horde players, so easier to find targets while honor-farming.
---
I remember reading from somewhere that he’d got that name from exactly that but i could remember wrong
---
Considering they'll be replacing it with a dungeon piece in phase 2 and it isn't even much of an upgrade piece for them, yeah it does, especially if they are on horde.
---
This is just not true. You can still clear AQ and Naxx with those specs. Check out any numerous youtube video about it from back in the day.
---
Is that right
---
Sorry, shouting won't help with drops, just rolls.
---
Alliance winning BGs? Lol.
---
I prefer Horde zones tbh. And I wouldn't call any of the WoW player models 'beautiful'.
---
People who don't like Riposte for leveling are objectively wrong and stupid enough to try to justify their dislike by claiming Riposte isn't as good or wouldn't work for their playstyle.  
---
Mobs are everywhere, but collecting 5 of them at once requires a specifc enough situation that you might not get to do that every 5min, but rather every 8min. And with Deepcombat + 11 points Sub to get ghostly strike I can grind chainpull indefinetely without stopping to eat or bandage with mobs 1 lvl lower.  
---
AR is fun, but overrated in regards to effiiciency.
---
if you're also avoiding guards, you could get reported and suspended.
---
If you're just killing him while he's up there and youre on the ground, you're fine
---
Endless BRD runs have killed my motivation in general.  I figure I'll go get gear at 60 when I can just smash through it with friends really quickly.  The worst part for arena runs was doing around 60 runs and only seeing the boss I need one time.
---
Just a note for people who missed this (like myself for too many levels) - Heroic Strike not only costs rage but removes generation from the next auto-attack which is the big issue.
---
You can jump off the lift in Thousand Needles from the town down there and land on one too.
---
Dude pls put class colours on in your raid frames
---
Well, frankly as a horde player I'm often attacked by alliance but never by horde so I'd say you're wrong. Alliance are the bloodthirsty ones. Horde never give me any trouble.
---
definitely a paladin
---
Agreed. I've also leveled toons on both factions and while Horde are more likely to gank, Alliance are far more likely to corpse camp.
---
Horde will jump you and move on, Alliance will jump you and sit on your corpse for an hour.
---
Funny original content? Not a picture of a screen taken with your phone?
---
Our hero ❤️
---
Alliance = wipe my ass and feed me mommy.
---
Meh, gotta help my Horde boys if I see a fight.
---
Plz as on come to atiesh horde and trigger a xfer.. It's so dead
---
Not necessarily. Without Desolace you go direct Theramore-Darn with zero problems. The pathing is just dumb sometimes.
---
I still do that, but this way I can also pickpocket mobs to level lockpicking, more easily avoid mobs I cba fighting, and use cheapshot in dungeons for the 2 free cp
---
You're on the other faction. You get to kill them.
---
Yes, then he did because apparently "being on pvp puts him at a disadvantage" so hes now allowed and hes not backtracking. Every time he stepped out of dungeons he got all his fanboys to swarm the area and even maybe caused a dc at one point doing his warrior quest.
---
Happened to me couple of times
---
Those flight paths are terrible. You pay only to end up taking unnecessary turns when getting to your destination.
---
Try Heartseeker. It’s the only PvP realm totally dominated by alliance. I can prove it too for my realm. I have two accounts and I’ve kept track of the 60s. 74% of the level 60s here are alliance. And I can do a count of ANY zone that is contested and horde will be outnumbered at a 4 to 1 minimum. It’s hell here as horde. 
---
Gorge earlier had 4 horde and 89 alliance. Felwood had 113 alliance and 12 horde. STV was literally hundreds more alliance than horde. I lost track counting. We need more horde here so much. All the alliance on the overpopulated realms like Stalagg transferred here and no horde did really.
---
Yeah, except stoping in Auberdine to then go to Theramore is faster too.
---
And every time you've fought Alliance they've honourably waited until you've eaten/drank back to 100% HP and mana and wait for you to buff before attacking.
---
Right.
---
Exactly. I used to get worried when I saw a hordie. Now I only get nervous if there are 3 of them and they’re my level or higher.
---
Okay but it’s not phase 2, and maybe you can say that for horde because they have that one better trinket but it’s still good for them.
---
You lose rep when they turn green.
---
Fuck if I know, we got half a story here and a lot of QQ going on, just saying.
---
Racheet is a neutral flight master, notably flying from him to Theramore costs a lot more than flying to Rachet from Theramore.
---
Maybe if Alliance didn't run from PvP every time they'd be able to get together and put up a decent fight.
---
this april fools was downright prophetic. “the global cooldown timer has been added to all spells and abilities,” etc.
---
Understandable.

One problem is that people really have no common sense. There are people that spam /trade for ages 'can any mage open a portal to xx for me?'. THEY DON'T EVEN SAY WHAT CITY THEY'RE IN. As a mage I'd literally have to do their job for them and look up where they are, probably run over to them, only for them to find out it takes a rune of portal that costs a bit of money and probably expect I'll give it out for free.
---
The only time I wanted a portal, I looked up what it takes, bought a rune, ran to the next high level mage, whispered them something along the lines of 'hi, can you please open a portal to TB for me? I have the rune and I'm right next to you' and got a portal. No tip because broke, but only 10 seconds inconvenience for the mage.
---
Explain this one OP
---
It's a pain sometimes to make water, especially when you have a new rank and you only get 2 from each cast, but this guy's behavior is a little extreme. If you ask nicely there should be no reason why he shouldn't give you any. There are some people out there who act like assholes who feel entitled to food and water. I've lost count the number of times I've had strangers open up trade without even asking. Think there's an addon out there that allows you to make note of people who act like this, which will allow you to steer clear of them in the future.
---
Wait, which of the two was faster?
---
Stoneform is amazing man. Viper Sting, poisons, blind, bleeds for vanishing, etc. I’d say they’re just as useful as orcs. WotF of course is busted but fear itself is too in classic. Fear Ward isn’t nearly as useful as wotf except for bosses. Makes Ony easier than normal and Nef especially.
---
The true classic experience for most readers here seems to be playing with the default ui with 0 key bind. But that just means they've been bad for 15 years
---
Download atlas loot add on and it’ll tell you every drop and it’s percentage of drop from whichever boss/trash in the dungeon.
---
And I thought all allys play paladin.....
---
Mongoose bite doesn't scale with anything but crit I think

Good thing he didnt pay for a mount
---
Qq more f words
---
I don't understand what I'm supposed to be seeing. Why would OP take the one with multiple stops that costs more? Maybe it's the noob in me, but doesn't it make sense that one long flight would cost less then several shorter ones??
---
Skookum
---
I got bad news for you, rage generation at low levels sucks regardless of dual wield or 2handed.
---
Thank you. :)
---
Like the little bitches that they are!

Had the numbers advantage and still blew it, typical alliance lmao.
---
I cant wait to supplement my honor rank with alliance tears

It wasn't until WoD that I realized male taurens were saying "How may I aid you?" instead of "How may I hate you?".  I started playing in 2005.

Hello Fotm player. Herod was initially the non streamer server. Enjoy your stay and try to make it past level 40.
---
Bigglesworth is insane mode if you are ally
---
[Yep.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/onyxia-lair-attunement-classic)
---
Get Gatorbite from Maraudon next.
---
Yup it sucks. That’s why Warriors get Ravager asap and use it in dungeons till 60. Otherwise you’re just an auto attack andy.
---
I looked at the imgur post. It doesn't discuss any loot rules. How about you read MY post instead of downvoting me and assuming I didn't read yours, lol.
---
I did goblin engineering and mining but on my sever heartseeker mining is incredibly inefficient there are just too many people to find thorium with any consistency. Might drop it and bankroll alchemy. Looking forward to dapper charges and grenade in pvp, the repair bots are great to bring to raids too!
---
You only compete against your own faction for ranks, alliance have to poopsock for r14 while horde can take 15 minute breaks between every wsg pop.
---
Alliance are so salty lmao.
---
youre whining more than your baby lol.  but if you dont think horde has the vastly superior racials youre in complete denial.
---
You can macro charge to put you into battle stance as well in one button. After charging in you should have enough rage after your swing to thunder clap, then switch back to prot stance with another keybind. At this point you should have enough rage to demo and then work on priorities. 
---
Thunderclap is god tier for damage mitigation, but if you don’t have charge rage forget about it. Anytime you range pull demo and focus on priorities instead.
---
Well just like retail, it'll kill the economy.
---
Prices would crash/spike depending on the items (I'm talking about AH)
---
Major advantage for those with disposable income/mummies credit card.
---
This isn't retail, things aren't just givdn to you, everything you have, you earn. Epic mount? Getting that is a big achievement for a lot of people. Now imagine you can just... *click* there we go got it... Nah that's not good at all.
---
Don't be lazy, if you can't understand this then I think retail is the version for you.
---
Nahh its a very nice trust me.
---
Waiting for answer too
---
I'm not sure. I don't really think a "world first" was documented. Maybe if you do a little digging you might be able to find it though.
---
In the the wow diary John Staats also says they made them fly through low pop regions for performance boosts (since flying tended to be very performance heavy in 04)
---
It doesn't take a mastermind to figure out that outrageous garbage is what people click on. I'm not saying his personality and antics are all an act that's obviously not true he has real issues. What I am saying is the stupid ass wow shit that people keep talking about with him is definitely manufactured and the people who fall for it are morons or looking for low tier entertainment.
---
11/10. Thank you.
---
People are forgetting about Uldaman. Do one or two of those runs with all the quests and you'll get lots of exp.
---
The warriors that LF1M tank aren't exactly the best geared or skilled. If they were geared, they would not need gear from 5 man dungeons. If they were undergeared but skilled, they would realize that they would get more dungeons done by tanking, and thus gear up faster. 
---
Now if a group already has a tank and another warrior wants to come dps, then I have no problem.
---
Healing when under geared just feels futile, you spam your most efficient rank 3 heal on the tank for the entire boss and pray that the boss does before you run out of mana. You get a total of like 3 big heals and if that's not enough there's nothing you can do. An extra pack was pulled? Well we're dead. 
---
Healing when over geared? You just couldn't give any less fucks about what people are doing. With a lot of MC gear you can deal with anything. Dps pulls aggro? Just spam lesser heals on everyone and heal 70% of their health in 1.5 sec casts. Get mana whenever it's convenient, you don't really need 100%, let mp5 do the work with 40% mana that's enough for most things, you can always pop a mana pot of things get bad. Tank is too scared to pull? I have a shield, I can pull and spam heal myself until this mob is dead. 
---
An extra pack gets pulled? Whatever. Two extra packs? Why are you making me work so hard? Dps pulls the entire room? Well, I have ankh... 
---
I have full control over if the group lives or dies, whatever mistake dps or tanks makes, I don't care, I can just out heal it.
---
Ally compete in a faction that inhernelty has less pvpers in it though.
---
&gt; Prices would crash/spike depending on the items (I'm talking about AH)
---
I'd need a source and reasoning behind why this would ever be the case since wow tokens do not create gold, it only transfers it between players.
---
&gt; Major advantage for those with disposable income/mummies credit card.
---
I see this reasoning a lot, do you think nobody bought gold before wow tokens?
---
because all the arena guys think PvP is not fun unless it takes 45mins to kill 1 person.
---
You have to take off your gear when you enter town because otherwise you'll get some avoidance from the stats.
---
After more than 80 BRD runs you can't image the reaction that I just had after reading this...
---
Only alliance should go slam spec. 
---
As Horde your rotation is BT&gt;WW&gt;Hamstring for rage dump and WF procs.
---
Real love: Chatting in game when you’re sat next to eachother irl.

Tremor totem says Hi.

level 59 just respeced for the first time because i did MC. You can do all dungeons as shadow spec.
---
60 water for healer, and 1 stack per caster is what I do. More if they need, but I haven't had any complaints yet. I usually take 60 for myself too, but I like to drink after pretty much every pull for a tick or two
---
Ok so I’m still having issues deciding on a main...got a 20 Druid but then switched to a 27 mage and now I’m getting an itch to switch to warrior. Wanted to play warr originally but got turned off by all the people saying how painful it is to level, mage had been a breeze so far. I’m not new to the game but never levelled a warr in classic. 
---
Shall I bite the bullet and reroll? Is warr really as bad/slow for levelling as people say? I already fell behind with my swap to mage so it’s a given now, are all the starting areas empty now?
---
Assuming you're not asking this question to be edgy- Yes - This subreddit is everything related to classic WoW. But you'll find that memes fill the void between the dev updates.
---
Everyone wants a tank, but no one wants to let them tank!
---
Currently leveling arms. When I get to 60 is it better to switch to 1h fury for raids?
---
One csv per item per character per server
---
Right but idk if that really answers my question. Why is it that when I swap defensive gear on, my block and parry chance go up but not my dodge chance. I’m not gonna spend an hour parcing data, I just want to know if it’s a tooltip error or what.
---
That is his job and his life. There's basically no reason he SHOULDN'T do this.
---
Ah yes Warlock. Such a rough class to pvp on, I feel so sorry for you.
---
Cheers, thank you!
---
maybe on your server, i know you are not the 1st not even the 1st to post on reddit
---
You got 99 problems but your wife had none....

;)
---
There’s no huge benefits enchanting gives you. Everything can be bought from another enchanter. The main benefit is the ease of enchanting your own gear.
---
Aside from that enchanting is just a money making profession (by selling mats and enchanting other people).
---
Same
---
Way less people buy gold because its bannable without tokens
---
Against the rules, drastically limiting the amount of people doing it, while also risking bans.
---
Wow tokens are a pathetic excuse for stopping gold selling. They exist to give blizzard that profit.
---
lul that rogue deserved to die like a noob he was :)

Do you think everyone buys gold or something? You are vastly overestimating this.

Sitting in a Magic Stun throughout half of Scarlet Monastery, watching mobs peel from you while the Priest healer is wanding shit...REEEEEEE!!!!!

Make a ticket asking which stage you are on.
---
I think only horde because of WF totem, no? On alliance I think DW edges it.
---
Going to make a macro for it for sure.
---
Btw what is the addon that shows you the level in chat?
---
Oh fuck off
---
Checkmate, alliance scum
---
At the moment.
---
Holy crap thanks for the silvers you guys! This is officially my most successful Reddit post ever lol
---
What I would do is go on wowhead classic, and search for your quest. Look at all the different stages and go to each of the questgivers in the chain. 
---
Failing that, make a ticket like the other guy said.

---
Yeah but to be fair, think of what it's like to be a horde warrior at the end of every boss fight:
---
"This is mine....and this is mine.....and this is also mine" (courtesy of being the only mail(up to 39)/plate wearers in the group)
---
And so would the two handed tanking to speed up dps as well!
---
Yeah what were you thinking!
---
At 45 with the ravager axe I top DPS in dungeons even with 50s, until I get to a solo mob/boss and my dps takes a shit and I fall to the bottom. Arms is great for trash mobs becuase of sweeping strikes and whirlwind with stance dancing. Plus ravager proc makes it much more valuable than its listed dps suggest on group pulls. But miss or get dodged on a solo mob and you’re useless.
---
but you almost died to the deep wounds!! eat him
---
To each their own I say. I personally have always hated the artwork so it's always been hidden for me. And I feel like buttons take up too much space I can use for other things.
---
it's listed on a lot of blogs as being bis, because for alliance they cant get [Rune of the guard captain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain) 
---
So even on horde, where there's better  available to you at the expense of a level 45-50 elite quest, i find hunters still rolling.
---
Really?
---
Damn, I was looking forward to generating more rage when I begun dual wielding at 20. The current state is driving me mad.
---
Loot council is fine, as long as you trust your officers.  If you dont, gtfo
---
Looks like you're about to have a good time with that woman
---
Rage from being hit is pretty minimal compared to auto attacks generating rage. Warriors simply use a lot of auto attacks.
---
I don’t know what your rotation is like, but be sure to put up at least 1 sunder armor if the tank is not a warrior, and stop using heroic strike.
---
And be prepared to be very disappointed in dual wield at that level: it sounds great in theory, but rage generated from 1h hitting is a lot less, and you’ll be missing A LOT with the offhand.
---
Sword is better for mages too. Especially if you're trying to PvP, then you'd rather use the prebis dagger than this staff to make sure you have an offhand that you can use (skull, etc)
---
No. https://youtu.be/NBm8e2__3oQ?t=100
---
IT's a joke.
---
and it was ment to be diluted (if thats the right word, non american here)
---
but the soldiers never did that cause, you know, harder hitting alkohol.
---
on the other hand i think dwarfes probably drink beer with even more alcohol
---
Imagine if everyone that got a blue boe made a reddit post :)
---
He didn't. He linked it. He didn't say roll for it.
---
This. Did not realize how valuable that axe is in dungeons till I got a dps meter. My lawd I’m destroying everyone on group pulls.
---
I'd heard about ravager, unfortunately it's currently a pipe dream for me, I'm only up to level 17 with my tank alt.
---
I think it's Prat, a chat addon.  Mostly got it for being able to click on links and copy paste stuff.
---
Haha, I'll give it a shot!
---
I mean you don't have any kind of evidence for this.
---
god bless you
---
Thank you lol.
---
why anybody will buy it even for 1 gold?o.o
---
Do you think everyone buys wow tokens or something? You are vastly overestimating this.
---
That sounds volatile, much appreciated my friend
---
Yeah. Just rerolled yesterday.
---
Doesn't matter where you're going in the world, you're gonna have a layover in Atlanta.

Horde on that server. More alliance ganked me in hillsbrad than I can count and not my level all skulls for no reason. I tend to leave most ppl alone unless they're taking my mobs. But getting griefers who camp 22's for hours on end in hillsbrad is what a lot of horde dealt with there. I settled on ashenvale to lvl out there was way more peaceful.
---
Didn't work for me. Still  crashes :|
---
The point of the post was to show the venture miner dropping it, which is a 0.01% droprate, which is really really rare
---
No, I just wanted to go to the beach.
---
so you have a better idea on how to put gold sellers out of business? Cause for some reason game companies have been struggling for years until they figured out that making gametime a tradeable commodity almost eliminated gold selling completely.
---
How viable is it to do all three roles while levelling as a druid? I like the idea of being healer, tank or dps depending on what the group needs. Is it as simple as carrying gear with different stats?
---
It's usually faster to split up the flight paths actually. Sometimes you can save quite a lot of time. The downside is you can't afk while flying though.
---

I never remembered it being called vc, and was antichange, but one day I was sitting at the mailbox at Sentinel hill making bandages and looking for a group and "lfg vc" just flowed so naturally, definitely muscle memory from being in the exact situation so long ago. I now accept that it did shift to vc at some point, even though i didn't initially remember it.
---
just report them with screenshots, or even better, a video.
---
did you extract them from the rar file
---
I'm getting tired just looking at this.
---
You gain stacks of reckoning when you get critically hit. You might not notice it in combat because the stack might just be used the next time you auto.
---
Your reckoning stacks should look like the same icon in the talent tree.
---
I think what you are supposed to do is when you get into combat, you sit so you get 100% chance to be critted. You do this 4 times because reckoning stacks up to 4 then you do your normal rotation.
---
This player is a filthy spy pretending to be Alliance when really he is another one of those horrid 5v1 gankers. 
---
Source: Me, an Alliance that gets nonstop ganked in Xv1 fashion on Netherwind, a "somewhat balanced population" server.
---
Too late I logged but plenty of people reported.
---
Is "molton" core a meme now?
---
It's a bit worse for PvE but not so much that it really matters, however in PvP is where you really take a hit. Not having the freedom of starting the fight with an off-hand like skull or others could really make you straight up lose a duel because you're using a staff. This staff is s comparatively bad PvP weapon if you're fighting against players that know what they're doing.
---
It‘s the same with the priest shield. Sometimes I get pushback while it is still active.
---
Why are you drinking as a lock? You should just be life tapping away your whole health bar and waiting to be healed for the rest.
---
 The point of the post was to show the venture miner dropping it, which is a 0.01% droprate, which is really really rare, obviously.
---
yeah, the modifier for rage generation is half when you're dual wielding and dual wielding has an inherently larger chance to miss auto attacks so honestly you might end up generately even LESS rage
---
From what I've seen from guild recruitment channels holy paladins are in pretty high demand. Lucky for me that's what I main so I shouldn't have much trouble finding raid spots and gear.
---
Yyp, just bad camera
---
I mean you can DE what you make as a tailor and enchanting at 300 can be profitable if you have the rare enchants. I'm a Skinner/tailor though since some recipes call for leather and I don't want to buy it. Plus, you can vendor/sell leathers by just skinning.
---
You certainly can, but most guilds who are pushing for kills and or whatever will only want 1 shadow priest per raid for the shadow weaving to buff warlocks :p
---
Otherwise I’ve seen a lot of guilds with people in “meme specs” doing fine. 
---
Though I’m not sure if that will hold up in tier 2 and beyond.

It only procs on melee hits, so for a hunter blackhand's breadth and rune of the guard captain are BiS and those are both quest rewards.
---
Most of the pvp servers just have a population imbalance in favor of horde, so it does tend to be a bit tougher. That being said both factions show up as skulls in low lvl areas probably an equal amount, maybe even more Alli because we are salty about the outnumbering
---
I mean, you’re not wrong
---
Restorative Potion
---
Warlocks can play around it a bit, because it can happen that it removes some curse or other magic effect instead of the fear. It works wonders against mage sheep though.
---
Yes, leveled up with multiple druids in guild and they did that. Lots of bag space tho :/
---
Even on retail you can de stuff you are wearing.
---
So... Time is money... And money is money, which means Money^2? 
---
Sorry, math isn't my strong suit.

During leveling the ss bag isn't worth it. I have 2-4 shards usually, so it happens you run out accidentally sometimes. During instances I keep a few extra for stones etc.

I played on skullshield ally until I rerolled on another server. The 2:1 hord/ally ratio made me always feel hunted.  As lv 32 getting 5 ppl on horseback corps camping you is not even fair.  
---
Both sides got as holes.  
---
Your best bet to avoid gank squads is to find a Server with decent Ratio between factions because once it goes 2 of one side for each of the other it just leads to problems for both sides.   
---
1: The weaker side rerolls, The stronger side gets even stronger.
---
2:The weaker side once bg is added gets instant que
---
The stronger side get hours to join bg ques.  Thus weaker side gets better gear and wins more easily.  
---
3:This leads to bored pvp from the stronger side who never get to que, go out in the world to gank others this leads back to (1).

&gt;Rage is a non issue in retail for example. Meaning you don’t have to think about it cause you are always in rage.
---
This is what is known in the professional circles as "bad game design".
---
You can fix that by pushing them into "having fun" with sub-optimal classes while you secretly tryhard.
---
Bonus points if you get them into support roles... for you of course.
---
Nor in Vanilla it isn't. Argus is technically light years from Azeroth.
---
You need to make sure you’re using a good program to extract. 7Zip wasn’t doing it correctly.
---
Imagine acting superior over slightly shorter q times lol
---
enchanting advantage is that sometimes materials you can get is worth more than the gear itself, other than that it's not too profitable unless you've got some of the rarer recipes like crusader
---
You do get brilliant mana oil when ZG is released which is in pretty high demand for healers but that's a long way off
---
Don't be a knobhead. It could be read two ways.
---
Also, wait until your 60 to go back and get Felhunter - you won't need him while leveling.
---
Are there any necessary talents for it? Best tree? Thanks for the help
---
He isn't talking about the numerical values being displayed, but rather the way in which the floating combat text appears.
---
Yea it’s an axe I probably want but still don’t have as a 35. I can normally find time for 1-3 dungeon runs per week so I might never get it before I outlevel it lol.
---
I do get the blue fast axe from Gnomeregan last night and it’s really good compared to the Darkshire sword I had lol. Archeus or something.
---
i felt this.
---
I think people are taking the asmongold hate circlejerk too far now.
---
I didnt downvote anyone in this thread, I didnt even upvote anyone. It shows the loot being rolled off and given to someone who wasnt highest or lowest roll. Glad you missed the part where I said higher up that it wasnt any +1 rules or anything that gave him the right to the loot over my guildie.
---
I had no idea int gave more weapon skill xp...but I'll buff warriors with it from now on too
---
So me and my friend got a Shadowfang drop at SFK yesterday, agreed to sell it immediately and split it.  So I have around 80g in the back as a level 30 shaman.  Thoughts on what I should do with the gold or should I just keep it for my mount?
---
I had a RL buddy who was like that. He became an officer in his guild and was very charismatic. He was extremely on point and was the sort to do all the research on how to be better and to organize raid runs so they went to their very best. He put in a ton of effort to the point the game was less a game and more a sport.
---
I can't imagine doing anywhere near as well as he did, I just play the game to have fun, not to be the best. Also I don't want to manage interpersonal drama that seems to go on frequently in raiding guilds.
---
Maybe, but the combat itself was pretty fun in retail. Felt fluid and fast. I kinda miss that aspect.
---
And slow down the group because you’re stealing healers mana.
---
Have you seen firsthand what happened? You couldn't sell in trade, look for groups in the LFG channel or world chat. There was spam everywhere.
---
Hours later, and there are still hundreds of them leveling up.
---
This is simply not true. One life tap brings me to 80% hp at my level, and gives about 10-12% mama. I need 20% mama for one rain of fire.
---
Putting corruption on 5 targets and ROF, I won't even make it one pull without life tapping.
---
That said, I don't mind eating drinking after every pull, but it's quicker to tap to equal hp/mama, then eat and drink. The problem with healers is that they heal me up regardless (often big overheals) so I might as well tap all of my hp.
---
I'm okay with a healer leaving me around 70% hp, I can manage the rest on my own.
---
I started Nelf rogue and there was plenty people in there.
---
Kinda weird how 5 people rolled then?
---
I don't understand how that's manipulating climbing. In this situation, the players COULD target him. Range can target him and melee can walk up to him. Just not the npcs.
---
&gt;*costs

Every time a healer has to grind (somewhat capably), it costs them 100g.

Nope. Don't have a better idea on how to put them out of business, only that it is better to have them than to have tokens.

In the end the gold is still being sold, just in larger quantities when done via tokens.

I don't give a shit about blizzard earning more money with tokens, their profit is my lowest priority.

Dwarves are absolutely beautiful, I’d even go as far as perfect.

Every single person I know on retail buys or sells tokens.

Only one of them bought gold from gold sellers.

Anecdotal sure, but the population at large isn't very different.

"AHHH" is exactly the same as "AH", a short noise, no matter how many H you put in there, because H doesn't have continuous sound  
---
so many games get it wrong too
---
He never wins.
---
Good meme sir
---
Can you explain? Asmon moved to herod?
---
Dang it John, when you were lvl 14 and I whispered you “hi John,” I never thought it would end like this. :(
---
Locks killing themselves after abusing Life Tap always makes me laugh.
---
My first WC run in Classic (2019 classic not classic classic) had a Warlock bitch at me for healing the DPS during a drawn out fight even though our tank was fine and nobody died (I prioritized the tank of course) and then later he died from spamming life taps and getting aggro and asked why I didn't heal him. I was almost tempted to not rez him. Almost.
---
...Except my original post was before your +1 rule response. But I'm glad you're glad.
---
Is this the situation where the mage is friendly with Gadgetzan so they won’t attack?
---
Glad to hear they’re finally acting with normal human decency, how novel.
---
Not just the notes, but everyone in a 60-80yard radius shows up. Gives you a massive heads up about who is potentially about to gank you.
---
Had no clue that pattern is bop. Are there any other similar bop patterns
---
In my last video got criticised for runing with 60 so this time full zf gy run with 4 mages and priest. Its not 100% performance run, it can be done faster but it gives general idea how to do it for anyone who has never done it.

Keep it for mount 100%

Well the funny thing is that I just said "known hate-subreddit". But I'm glad that he admitted that it is The_Donald in his response.

Good to know! Thanks

Imagine, just for a second, how amazing it would be if he tried to do this shit and literally no one cared. No one gave him any attention. God that would make my whole scrote tingle.
---
And mine was at +2 and is now at 0. We arent the only people to have seen this thread.
---
You can do it with macro.
---
Lmao
---
well thats just a waste of loot imo, and im raiding as shadow myself
---
If you wanna give something in return, just toss them a couple silver, not too much is usually enough to make them want to give you more water.
---
Usually if people tip me I give em another stack

You're telling me it's quicker to fly from Ashenvale to Felwood via Orgrimmar when the Org-Felwood path goes over the same outpost in Ashenvale?

15-20 talents are preference with some people choosing longer stun, more damage on bite and better shout, or better stealth with more threat. Also you can go omen before furor, but i find it tedious to wait for energy in cat when soloing. Or you can forgo omen for better healing.
---
Guilty confession: I was, I just realized I'm not supposed to. Also yes, I know the tooltip says it generates a high amount of threat, but other than heroic strike I have no other attacks I can reliably use that deal damage (I'm learning more and more that warriors are supposed to be about that auto attack life).
---
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
How do I best look for a group as a newbie to all raids and dungeons? I played up until level 35 in 2006/07 via just quests and am returning, currently level 23 and have played RFC once. 
---
Should I be open and just say "complete newbie LFG for WC" ... etc?
---
The worst part is that in Classic at level 50 you'll hand these in for half a bar of XP each and may not even get a ding.
---
I still dont know which one
---
No, I agree the implication is there, but it was not stated, what the fuck do you expect blizzard to do?
---
Youre purposefully being stupid.
---
Thanks! Much appreciated :)
---
You wanna use something low-rage to generate overpower procs, since ur dps is use ham string. 
---
Spam that and when overpower procs use overpower
---
That is actually a solid idea.
---
Hillsbrad is a higher level Alliance zone, so it may not just be people ganking for the sake of ganking.
---
Imagine being this angry that people clicked a different box when they opened up a video game
---
Any idea why I can't find this on twitch addons? nothing comes up except "extended character stats" and "character owned" count
---
Learn what not to do in certain matchups, if they’re melee, demo and thunderclap em like they’re trash mobs. Assuming they’re not gonna 2 shot you, you’ll throttle their damage significantly. If they do heavy burst like a shaman, forget about it. You gotta race blowing them up before they do you.
---
If you haven’t already, macro your big cooldowns to switch you to their appropriate stances, like charge, shield wall, etc. The last thing you want is to fat finger the wrong ability because you’re in the wrong stance because your panicking (not to mention you’re that much faster).
---
Intimidating shout bandage combo will save you’re life. Just watch for dots on you. (Intimidating shout is also a great option for melee fights if you’ve just finished a 2H auto and they’re about to hit you to min max, but that’s power gaming territory)
---
If you’re fury, try to avoid staying in fury stance when fighting. You can cast Bloodthirst from any stance, just like MS. And only switch into zerker when whirlwind comes off cooldown, or you need to kick. Obviously don’t be in zerker when you’re getting kited, you can use most offensive moves in battle stance. And if you don’t have any rage to begin with, consider prot stance till you get back into melee. 
---
The only exception to the zerker rule is warlocks and priests. The extra damage taken is nothing compared to the get outta jail free card in this match up. Charge in and switch to zerker. And once bezerker rage is on cooldown and you don’t have a million rage, switch back to battle stance.
---
If you don’t have piercing howl, consider getting it. It shuts down druids and hunters nigh single-handedly. Druids especially, because once they shape out of your hamstring and get out of melee, they’re still in howl range. And their 1/3-1/5 mana pool cost to shape shift vs the 10 rage is savory.
---
Mages will always kill you. Treat them like the pope, and just smile and wave. If you have to fight one, bring friends, and do your best to kill all of his.
---
This might be too hardcore idk, but consider investing in weapon swapping macros for certain engagements. I pop defensive stance sword and board when I anticipate a rogue (that’s usually like 27% damage reduction for their stun combo). Duel wield for rogues for free overpower procs (consider a macro to always swap to 2H for your overpowers) and for priests to burn through inner fire. 2H when I’m hitting squishies and sword and board/d stance when I’m getting kited.
---
You do realise that weapon is only BIS because of the on use effect, which has 3 charges......... so for it to be BIS you need to have like 30 of them in your bags lol.
---
Where is WOW mobile?
---
There's nothing pro about this. I've been doing it since 2005 and it really depends on class, as others have pointed out if you need spirit tap or remorselessness you'd be a fool to let the mob get the last hit.
---
Lazyal the time!
---
&gt; why is he a scummy douchebag?
---
[This diatribe sums him up pretty well.](https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman/status/760569532960284672)
---
If you're in a group, you give people water. The others press their buttons for you as well, don't they?
---
Open world is a different story. I politely ask mages to sell water. If they insist on giving it for free it's nice, but it's ok if they don't.
---
Yea like wtf why horde do dis?
---
Yes, unfortunately most people want absurd tips just to make it for you from what ive seen.
---
Blizzard has the whole fucking chat log is the point. Taking 35 different screenshots isnt mandatory to raid. You take whats there.
---
Shouldn't have left mods on.
---
I never refuse to give free food &amp; water, and these guys clearly are idiots before being mages, no argument here.
---
But people also need to understand that depending on lvl, we may craft stacks of 2 or stacks of 4. Making it for the whole party will often take several mana bars and full regens. It's not like we're always carrying 100 of each. We do it because that's teamplay, but spending the 5 first minutes of a dungeon making water sure is no fun. :)
---
EDIT : just logged in IF, 3 ppl asking me food, one of them wanted 200 bread. I'm lvl 52, that's 58500 mana to spend : 14 full mana bars. I just can't do that for a random. I respectfully told him no. The guy just BL me...
---
They didn’t tell me. Did you even read my post? I got a random whisper while questing. You just look dumb now.
---
I guess I should have specified with crits on green to yellow mobs or players (aka what you should be leveling on as a melee). I play a rogue and this is most definitely the case, I had trash dagger main hand for the first 30 or so levels. Ambush and backstab don’t require a super hard hitting dagger, though it certainly helps. Literally a video showing this and the sub daggers build posted here just a couple of days ago.
---
Questie is more for people who already did the quest log thing.  No new user needs it.
---
People in this subreddit really hate him with a burning passion so you won't get a honest answer. The truth is that a few hundred of his followers are absolute idiots and might be annoying but the server he is on also have more large scale community events than every other server combined.
---
But you're trying to prove your point, and argue blizzards stance that there was no loot system previously declared.
---
From all you've posted, they're right.
---
The ravager from Scarlet Monastery Armory. Or pick up Executioners Cleaver up off of the AH at 43
---
Brd arena warden and golemlord. First boss in LBRS. Jed rend runs in UBRS. Get frost damage bracers from ah with 17-21 frost dmg. Strat has bis neck and hat but takes more time. Frost dmg hat is good alternative. For ring you need to do save the princess then you can also buy band of the unicorn for around 20g. Scholomace has ok gloves and bis wand + main hand but takes a lot of time. Spirit of aquaments is best/easiest off hand.
---
I'm on Skeram and have been doing a bit of census work myself on Earthfury and Heartseeker. There seem to be about the same number of Horde 60s on both servers - but Heartseeker is a tier higher pop (e.g. HS at high when EF is medium). Must be hell to deal with.

Not really, it's a different design then rage in Classic.  What is bad design is that it's the same "Build energy bar, spend energy bar" that a good chunk of the classes have on retail, it makes classes feel samey.
---
Or: I was 11 when I first played classic and played without addons until Wrath, and I want to recreate MY classic experience as best as possible. Therefore: no addons.
---
Yeh I rolled a rogue knowing how hard it would be but it’s actually worse than anyone could have expected with this new retarded ‘spellcleave’ Mets. Every group wants 2 or more Mages as dps, it just isn’t sustainable.
---
She is already max level
---
Maybe it's a sign that is getting bored of classic and will go back to retail soon.
---
Still 100% chance of stomping rogues. All the stuns and bleeds in the world won't help.
---
Speaking from just SM, you have to get a feel for the tanks agro (and skill). Mostly you just wait 10-15 seconds before you start DPS.
---
Oh yeah, well Myzrael is the server. Totally forgot about faction. Thanks!
---
Nope it says

What you need is my Stand "The World". What you can find beyond the powers of my Stand is where you need to go in order to find Heaven. What you need is a trustworthy friend. He must be someone capable of controlling his own desires. He must be someone who is not interested in political power, fame, wealth, or sexual desire, and who chooses the will of God before the law of humans. Will I, DIO, be able to meet someone like this one day? What I also need is the lives of more than 36 humans who have sinned, because those who have sinned harbor a strong power within. There are 14 phrases that one must keep in mind: Spiral staircase Rhinoceros beetle Ruins street Fig tart Rhinoceros beetle Via dolorosa Rhinoceros beetle Singularity point Giotto Angel Hydrangea Rhinoceros beetle Singularity point Secret emperor I'll engrave these words onto my Stand so I won't forget them. What it most necessary is "courage"; I must have the courage to destroy my Stand momentarily. As it disintegrates, my Stand will absorb the souls of the 36 sinners and will give birth to something utterly new. Whatever is born will "awaken". It will show interest in the 14 words that my trusted friend will utter... My friend will trust me and I will become his "friend". Lastly, I need an appropriate location. North latitude, 28 degrees, 24 minutes, West longitude 80 degrees, 36 minutes... Go there and wait for the New Moon... That's when Heaven will come.
---
Thanks for posting this. So many people are complaining about the meta but I suspect that it's just a lack of understanding
---
Yeah, we all have phones!
---
That's something a #17 in the DPS charts says.
---
Probably shouldn't publically post screenies of Casino gambling.. what with them being bannable and all..
---
Getting personally defensive and defending an idea are two separate things. He made a comment on tone being pretentious pussyfooting. "Outdated Interest" is a joke considering it's being re-released due to POPULAR DEMAND IN THE FORM OF ILLEGAL SERVERS BEING CREATED REPEATEDLY. you know, TEAM EFFORTS REQUIRING YEARS OF REVERSE ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE AND EFFORT.
---
There's a warlock in my guild that I do everything I can to not group with. Within 2 secs of me entering the dungeon, he's already spamming "int", nothing else. We wipe? "int". I'm also positive that he just deletes the water/food I give him if he's tight on bag space, because he will open trade window every 5th pull, and not say anything and just expect me to hand him water. I know that his bags are full, because the trade cancels if I put more than 2 stacks into the window.
---
I fucking hate people like that. I'm a team player, but chill the fuck out, will ya? I'm pretty sure you can get through the first pull without int buff while I drink up after spending my entire mana bar on buffs for myself and the healer and 3 stacks of water for the healer.
---
you can be technically correct but still an asshole
---
yes
---
Yes there most definitely is
---
100% agree. This game desperately needed the improved itemisation it eventually got, and the reworked paladin- and druid-tanking. I could go for all of this by the time BWL hits, even.
---
Minus the part where you're ignoring my whole point in the title that world chat declaring loot rules was irrelevant. You can change your rules on a whim :)
---
I started with herb/alch, dropped alch for skinning, dropped herb for engi then dropped skinning for mining. You can start over whenever if it isn't working for you.
---
You've had 15 years to look through the game settings too.
---
First few days you could xrealm chat, but they disabled it
---
Why not just level to 60 then?
---
WTF?? That's a pretty significant bug
---
You can't change your rules, establish them in raid chat.
---
I dont understand those people, i am also mage, i craft tons of foods before i start questing and give those stacks anyone i met, they mostly dont ask for food but i give it anywany because i know they need it.
---
I’m a mage I usually ask people if they want food or water and make a bunch for them no charge... this is so stupid play as a team not solo..
---
Pls say sike
---
As for why. 
---
I think the activity itself is enjoyable. 
---
Sometimes things in life are not about g/hr .
---
lmfao the fact he doesn't just use a laptop makes this more funny
---
Well, according to a Mage in my guild, the people asking for water is almost non-stop. Even when he’s not in a raid/dungeon people whisper him or just invite him to a party to pretty much demand water.
---
And if it’s not given, he gets called a dick or an asshole.
---

Just go and do something else and come back later if they camp for too long. A few times I've alt tabbed and come back half an hour later and they're still camping which always makes me laugh because they try to waste my time and end up playing themselves.

I don't think you understand how economics works, tokens don't inject gold into the economy, it transfers it between players.

---
It's not reductionist thinking, it's the way things work.  People attract people who are similar.  You can see this in Youtubers and Twitch streamers.  CohhCarnage, a completely wholesome dude, attracts people who are on average 30+, who are chill, wholesome people.  He's not going to attract toxic 13 year olds, because his content isn't what they like or want to watch.
---
Asmon is toxic, trolly, edgelord meme-y.  It's his personality and how he does his content, and he attracts the same type of people in his fanbase.
---
There's the exception to every rule, but it is a super small minority.  Out of the 50k viewers he has at any given time, 49k are going to be ages 12-25, and toxic, trolly people.  It helps that this viewer range is the majority of the people who watch Twitch as well.
---
I can easily give examples of many many more streamers who's fanbase directly reflects them too, like Day9, Ezekial_III, BurkeBlack, TheNo1Alex, etc.

It does feel like i'm cheating.

Pretty much every pvp server is 60-40 or more in favour of horde, naturally, the racials give an advantage in PvP.
---
Blizzard just published the ratiotable for each server few weeks ago.
---
You can ban him for inciting and encouraging the spamming, if they're HIS followers and came to Herod because he did, he's the instigator and is at fault.
---
I normally don't care, but this caught my eye due to the strange path it took after I accidentally hovered over aubergine first.
---
But that doesn't matter. There's no evidence of that.
---
I know they meant it as a roll. You know that. But there is no proof of it, so what we know is worthless.
---
Yes, and?
---
Ahh my b, that emote can be so many different things these days it's hard to tell.  I just go with the '/s' when it's a joke.
---
That's what he says to trigger players like you. I'm gonna be surprised of he even plays there to any significant degree. He still has his guild on Faerlina, and a pretty well equipped character at that.
---
For me it's pretty simple;  "water" will cost you 5g and "Can I have some water, please?"will be free.
---
The trick is to just case fear twice tbh
---
This guy gets it.
---
OK let's say that's the case, I'm too poor. You on the other hand have money to burn.
---
Because of this, you buy gold/tokens. With this new in game fortune, you can afford nice gear, nice mount etc, none of which had anything to do with dedication or skill.
---
So now you have an instant advantage over me even though I've put more effort in... Fair?
---
Tokens will destroy classic.
---
Wait... there are exceptions... to generalizations and sterotypes? Damn, my mind is blown. Who would have thought that a generalization doesn't apply to 100% of people?!
---
He gave private servers maybe a 10-15% boost tops, Nost was famous because it was Nost, it was the only Private Server to really exist at the time.  If you already liked WoW and knew what WoW was, you knew what Nost was before Soda played on it.

Tfw you meet up with your gaming friends irl and aren't sure whether the line's blurring or you're going down the rabbit hole even further...
---
Tell me what you think the talent does and I'll tell you why you're wrong.
---
No one seems to be pointing out the main issues with rend so I hope you don’t mind an overview.
---
First off rend doesn’t scale. The tooltip at the moment of training is all it will ever do in damage. That being said, yes its damage is awful. The only time you should be using it is in solo fights while leveling to kill mobs faster. 
---
At 36 you get whirlwind, which even if your arms (until MS obviously), should outright replace whatever rage you were using on rend. At which point your only gonna be using it on rogues to prevent restealths.
---
Vanilla rend was never a mainline ability and the fact that we have to take 3 talent points in +35% rend damage to get to some of the meatiest talents we have, is one greatest tragedies we will ever know.
---
Personally, I never even used rend while leveling because I prioritized rage on demo and thunder clap so I didn’t need to eat as often between mobs. And most importantly for that sweet sweet mount gold.
---
I haven't heard anything about an Alcor's Sunrazor dropping yet.

Resto is desired for Windfury AND Mana Tide. Enhance's Improved Windfury is not desired enough to warrant bringing.

what i found was  ally 43% - horde 57%

and i'm sorry but a 60-40 split is not heavily anything.

in any given zone you might encounter 3 more horde than alliance.

I'm on grobb which is rp-pvp which is "apparently" slightly alliance heavy and its not a big deal

Tried to help a lower level kill a mob in ashevenvale. They immiately started trying to kill me which they did because i was low on health and put off eating to help them. So killed them and camped their corpse.
---
Yesterday on boat to ratchet, one random asshole on my side (horde) decides to start shit with the 2 alliance players. 4 of us 2 of them. He kills them. I say why. He just says "it arouses me". Then they tet rezed and now were all involved even though the rest of us just stood by and tried to let them kill the ganker.
---
The alliance priest mind controls me and goes to theow me in the water even though im doing nothing but of course danny dickhead had to start. Luckily we had a priest as well who MCd the priest into the water and saves me.

Nope not there! Was at max level as well.

The 'eux' is the same as 'ö' in German/Swedish. It's close to how the British pronounce the 'u' in 'burn'. The 'au' is just like how you say 'eau' in 'eau de cologne', it's really a closed o. Stress the second syllable.

Saying EMFH is an antiCC racial makes me think you've never PVPd in your life. It shared CD with the PvP trinket. You didn’t get to remove more CCs than other races. It just cleared up a trinket spot allowing you to do more damage/healing.
---
You’re also massively underselling Stoneform, presumably because you’re operating under the assumption that “Horde racial strong, Alliance racial bad”, so you ignore all upsides of being Alliance and only focus on the downsides.
---
Unfortunately not. We just have to ask kindly and hopefully they will come around. :)
---
Straight line with stop in Auberdine,  or straight to Rut'theran?
---
Lol yes but wildly different amounts of rage. Leveling, 2H I pressed a button every 8-10 seconds, dual-wielding I pressed a button every 3-5. Which felt much more rewarding.
---
Edit: I’m actually not sure what you’re confused about. I said more or less the same thing in what you’ve commented on.
---
Stop using TC, if you’re gonna use anything like that, at least make it whirlwind! That doesn’t mitigate terribly irresponsible dps though 😂
---
no thanks so far.
---
Skinning has yielded me a lot of gold. But mainly gold for first mount. I don’t foresee that I will keep skinning after I ding 40 and buy mount. It’s a lot of work to run around skinning. I also tried to disenchant green gear on an alt and in all honesty....it was probably a loss as the mats sell for less that vendor the green item. But we talk relatively low level greens 5 to 20 item level.
---
Most likely something with hidden aura things bugging out, Like you not getting hitrating from all your items, so when you requip some items your items you get yourstats back.
---
Most of them start getting stressed because they do want to hit 60. Its like an addiction. Not even joking. Theres been posts here about how to stop doing it. I think it has to do with leveling slowing down and they get used to making an alt and returning to instant gratification
---
Dude What if you have to go inbetween a bunch of Mountains and shit Making you go in circles.. Thats not faster. Ur statment is wrong

Your "overwhelming number of players" is just not there. You are delusional.
---
Imagine loosing to a clicker
---
I don't know if it helps anyone else at all but I just bound open all bags to B so I just press b and I can see all my shit same too close them

Which body part is your wife's name implying she is endowed with?

It gets better over time as you gear up. 
---
More damage = more rage
---
Critical Hit = more rage
---
Some talents = more rage
---
Hang in there. It’s a hard life in the beginning.
---
Using Concussive Shot to escape is pretty clever, I should actually start trying that on regularmobs as well when Feign Death doesn't work. Thank you :D
---
hes still online in silithus, i just checked.
---
I rerolled a tank from my lvl 26 rogue..yeah took about 3 runs of rfc to realize no one will ever listen. First run we had 2 hunters and a rogue was super smooth until I stopped for healer to get mana then the hunters tried to pull a group of orcs which chain pulled because of a pat and wiped.. all 3 dps blamed me and the 2 hunter bros left.
---
The second run we had a mage that didnt train his food spell (which is fine) and everytime I would to go pull he would shoot a frost bolt before I could charge in so i swap back to prot stance and i cant get agro on anything because no rage. Happened multiple times until we wiped and the healer left blaming me for not keeping agro.
---
Third run i left because we had 2 rogues level 12 that tried to stealth past the mobs and got caught every time and then they would run away from me
---
So yeah tanking isnt for me
---
I have axe, shoulder, helmet and legs. Am I missing any of his gear or can I go wait in the circle to be murdered while I pirouette?
---
I kid you not, I was in this zone today remembering this exact thing.
---
Classic wow is rlly simple and easy to enjoy but it would be better if it had a bit more content like bg(battlegrounds) or a bit more mounts and dungeons etc and modern wow is like when u just woke up from a coma for 30 years and suddenly see flying dildos its a bit overwhelming
---
If you really want to slam, wait til you get a super slow weapon like Asbkandi or something. The slower the weapon, the more value slam has. But for horde side, if you're in a group with WF, just rage dump into hamstring or sunder armor if there are not 5 stacks already.
---
Maybe I should have. He didn't respond well to feedback the first time so I decided to come up with an excuse instead of starting a discussion a second time.
---
What's dot dmg? I assumed Cheetah stunned from everything because even accidentally stepping into a campfire stunned me
---
Would you suggest playing modern wow or classic if I don't have anyone to play with?
---
the straight one?
---
Big thing for me is the challenge is back, questing is a must and you get to explore everything especially since no mount till level 40. I find the community and social aspect is way better too I don’t think I’ve had this much fun in WoW in years!!!
---
In dungeons, dps warriors should always focus the lowest level mob. You'll generate more rage.
---
Could literally write a 500 page book on the differences. The main thing is that most of the QoL stuff that you're used to dont exist. No group finder, no LFR, No summoning at stones (just warlock summons), no mounts until 40 and they cost a lot, abilities need to be learner at your class trainer every 2 levels and are expensive. The list goes on and on.
---
Weakauras and this : https://wago.io/Lp80lrn62
---
Nice, that quest was really satisfying to finish in a guild where your other Hunters already had it. It felt like you were finally one of the gang.
---
Since like level 30 I've been playing at a pace of one level every 5 hours of actual leveling (not traveling, afk or leveling professions). Best advice i was given was to level in green zones, green quests, green mobs. Im leveling as holy priest, but i won't enter a zone and start doing quests until im like 3 levels above the recommended. That way i can complete a zone in one sitting, and after 35 pretty much every zone gives you one full level for completing it. Some zones have a bunch of quests at one level then a bunch of other quests 5 levels higher (STV is a good example). So i complete every quest that is below my level until only quests that are my level or higher are left, then i leave to quest in another area and i come back when all the quests are at a lower level than mine. Then i do dungeons when i have all the quests i could find. But most of the time right after i do a dungeon i find another quest sending me back. On average ive done all 40+ dungeon like 3 times each because of this, and all those runs give a ton of xp. So thats the advice i can give you. I do play a lot but every day i feel like I've progressed quite a bit. I hit 59 today, i will probably hit 60 in like 2 days, taking my time not rushing at all, i think I've had a great classic experience.
---
Report this to Blizzard, not here.
---
Oh I have perdition's, it's core hound next for me, he and I already top charts as combat daggers so I'm thinking about going seal fate because it's viable in both PvE and PvP and I really don't care about DPS dickwaving in classic
---
Though I'll still probably be right up there with him as seal fate
---
Lol, I dont need more than Org to Xroads.
---
I saw two leave...
---
My macro is ready!
---
Yea it definitely works... seems bugged.
---
Being a dickhead to people in an online game is a pretty dickheaded thing to do.
---
u also get adrenaline rush for even more proc chances in a burst
---
Classic wow is a lifestyle more than a game. Retail is a game.
---
Guck this bullshit. 
---
As a priest I just heal people. It’s my job. As a mage you give water to the other players. It’s your job (at least in instances)
---
It's bound to shift+b by default.
---
Needs padding on the shoulders
---
I disagree on that one. I think the rogue should just get the chest. No one is missing out on anything because they couldn't open it anyway. I don't play rogue BTW.
---
RT
---
There are many differences, but the one that matters the most to me is:
---
The lack of bloat. In retail, there are about a billion factions to rep up with, there are daily quests to do, there's an insane amount of mounts to collect because simply GETTING a mount is no longer a challenge. In general, there's never a time when there's nothing for you to do. There's also a fair bit of content that becomes nothing more than filler, for example who's out there hanging around outlands (TBC expansion)? These areas are fairly empty as tons of people have leveled up to 100 (110? 120 now?) and have their time devoted to whatever the heck the lands of those expansion packs have to offer.
---
In classic, the majority of your levels are packed with people because quite literally the journey (to level 60) is part of the fun.
---
There ARE things I miss from retail: Retail had more races (Worgen, goblins, blood elves, Draenei, Pandaren) and more classes (Death knight, Monk, Demon hunters), and even engineering has some really awesome stuff you can craft. Truthfully however? If I could have the races + classes + engineering capabilities, that would be ALL I want. The issue however is also that the world DOES start to look a little silly with all these added races and classes, bringing us back to the bloat issue.
---
Sometimes frankly less is more.
---
Why oh why did he not have the robe keybound..
---
Gz on 60.!!What UI is that? A compilation or something you set up yourself?
---
miras song and  trash blade do work as furry, but you need the hit chance on gear to make it work. did my first MC some weeks ago with that setup and only 6% hit. i could feel this on my dps.
---
How they do that?
---
Why you wanna all that?
---
Warrior main. Alch and herb. Gotta drop herb for engineering. A druid alt is gonna gather the herbs and mine the ore. Easy
---
Its pre-raid BiS for hunters... actually, fury warrior, rogue and hunter share a lot of pre-raid BiS.. for example all wany the swords of Rend cause of the huge AP bonus...
---
I don't. Yes I raided a capitol. Any other questions?
---
Even on a 50:50 server like mograine. It’s still hard mode.
---
Reddit boomers seething
---
Yeah i got gamped last night by Alliance 60s doing MC for a while. Came out of BRD and got camped again. Blaumeux is just ruthless dude. Your 60s start a lot of shit.
---
I mean I feel bad but I get it... at some point I will be eyeing up certain items in dungeons to farm.. I’ll only be reserving one item at a time...that way it allows some people the chance to roll on other gear... but again if you create the party you have full control to do whatever you want... just you know don’t destroy your reputation.
---
Put 20 bucks you only watch his clips and not his actual streams? Most of the clips you see are way out of context esspecially that mentally unstable dude he was talking about the other day. I swear the reason he even trolls like this is cus y'all mald at anything he does
---
But this one is perfectly balanced!
---
Uhh why?
---
How do you layer it over the game? It's not there when I switch to the game
---
Standing out of range of a guard and killing someone is not abusing, its avoiding the guard. Doesnt matter if you are in a neutral city or your own fations city.
---
Same. It's the only logical way of hearing it. I won't hear it any other way. And you can't stop me!
---
Ravager. This name makes me sick, community acts like this is some kind of a holy grail or legendary weapon when in reality it's just an utter trash.
---
I rerolled. Not worth fighting streamkids and metapushers for gear.
---
That’s like...35-45 gold
---
Dam bet there was a lot of salty staff users after that roll
---
I don't have as much time as them to level. Leveling quickly = skill? OR Leveling quickly = HAS TIME TO LEVEL
---
I'm still superior :D
---
Well as long as you're enjoying the play style! If the gloves drop will you go head to head for them?
---
but they both have 1% crit
---
Because it’s a waste of resources and would keep tons of players away artifically.
---
Are the thunder charms not more profitable? They are 15S more valuable on my server for some reason, while fire charms go for about 8S each
---
There are a LOT of ninja looters. I've changed my group/raid rules to "Need all BoE's, Need before Greed on BoP"
---
This is only the beginning, my friend.
---
"That's started" 
---
It's more honest than both ninjaing and plaining making a group and inviting zero competition for items.
---
It was also around during vanilla. If you're putting the effort to run and lead a group, especially if you're a tank or healer. Then you can reserve anything. Doesn't mean people will be forced to join your group.
---
Should I spend my time doing that or quest to level up
---
*no sike*
---
Same with Feralas -&gt; Thunder Bluff, instead of just flying straight up for a minute, they decide to fly all across the Thousand Needles and the Barrens :(
---
Only way that comes to mind without causing too much drama is either a loot counsel addon or list what classes can roll on what on your discord or website. 
---
I would personally prefer either one of the addons or a clear list of who needs what somewhere. That way prio can be made before raid, everyone knows who gets what when it drops and looting takes 1-2 minutes and no one can legitimately whine.
---
It's a quest item that if you never turn it in, you can keep the transformation item, it's kinda awesome
---
The hate on reddit is much worse than ingame, in my experience. I'm sure you will be fine.
---
I'm just here to praise the name Eggy Azelea.
---
What’s with all these mages recently blinking INTO melee range lol
---
Do you actually have a death wish? :p
---
Hell yeah, finish quarter way from crossroads to ratchet
---
True it sounds fun then you got cry baby poopy pants over here talking about asmon ruined the server for an hour and dipped
---
Nothing infuriates me more than when people dont respond in chat. Just endless silence.
---
You're going to struggle to find a loot council that doesn't take "participation and guild progression bullshit" into account. An intelligent loot council isn't going to give an item to John, who turns up 1 day a month to raid (and tops the meters) over David, who turns up every raid and does slightly less DPs.
---
Guild progression is also important. It separates the people willing to go through gruelling shit with the guild to progress, from the people who only begin raiding once the raid is on farm.
---
If you want such a system with things as specific as you've said- It might be an idea to start a guild yourself.
---
I disagree with Asmongold on like a good chunk of what he says, but one thing he got right when describing gearing your raid, is that you have to incentivize people to try harder.
---
Jim, your top frost mage, isn't going to keep turning up if you give all the gear to Mike the frost mage who goes afk for 30 minutes every raid and complains about wipes.
---
One system that my guild is playing with while LC builds an idea of who "deserves" what is a 'decaying roll' system like you described.
---
If you win an item, you get 20 deducted from your next item roll.
---
You have to know what you’re disenchanting will give you. Sometimes an expensive green item will d/e to crap. Other times it could be a pair of bracers that would sell for 80s but d/e into 2g.
---
Its not mages being assholes. Its literally just assholes. Assholes come in every form. 
---
As a mage I make 100 waters every time I join a new group so they are ready to be traded.
---
this wasn't a mage, it was a manchild
---
Definitely 100% not worth it.
---
&gt; it happens you run out accidentally sometimes
---
Not if you spent 1 second looking at your shard count at the start of a dungeon, it ain't hard
---
To be fair though I haven’t met a single Mage that didn’t give me water like OP describes.
---
Say whatever you want mate, you're banned for probably a good reason, and if you are truly innocent then you should have no problems proving your innocence.
---
Reckoning works way different on classic. Here's Reytroy's video about reckoning in classic. Kargoz video is from.pserver where reckoning worked weirdly.
---
https://youtu.be/4YBIivTJEdQ this is about how reckoning works and how to make reck bomb.
---
https://youtu.be/c_MHIkMhSfc this video shows how to abuse spellbatching to get more procs from sitting

---
If you just wait like 5 seconds from when the tank first attacks you're probably safe
---
I bet you're right!
---
Nope 100% truth. I yell every roll and get high rolls. But I also am a multiboxer and run my own dungeons. So I win everything anyways... 
---
Let the downvotes and hate flow!! 
---
PSA: your hate fuels me to add more accounts and piss you off. Hope you all hate the fact that it's more challenging.
---
Karma points? I'm hoping for hate points….
---
Edit. Only 10 downvotes? Come on. You haters can do better than that. Let's get to 100!
---
I've been having the same issues as a healer. Said fuck it and went shadow for a bit. It gets really exhausting dealing with some of these people. They don't want to listen or learn, just pew pew everything as fast as possible.
---
&gt;If you thinking the experience isn’t the exact same on both sides, you’re absolutely delusional.
---
Majority of the Servers are heavily Horde favoured when it comes to populations you absolute fucking retard.
---
Who hurt you?
---
You're missing his post where he mentioned using bot programs for his "work from home". My logic is fine, you just came into the conversation a little late and don't understand whats going on
---
I’m surprised. The caster mobs are easier to kill than the fire ones. Just interrupt them and it’s a free kill
---
Hehe, indeed.
---
&gt;unless your server is heavily imbalanced
---
So pretty much the majority of servers then? Lmao
---
Thanks, I'll give it a go when I get on shortly!
---
In WOD my guild would do gambling nights.  Place the bet on the roll and see who rolled highest.  Like 50k buyins and shit, was good fun.
---
Did my first in 10+ years. Still got salty because of losing rolls! Damn real vanilla experience :)
---
Congrats bro!
---
I am sorry for laughing, but this is amazing. Like you two were enemy soldiers stranded on an island together and one of you thinks that you're telling this jeremiad, and all the other sees is
---
"MCPanda6969 makes strange gestures"  
---
"MCPanda6969 makes strange gestures"
---
We were both camping tidal charm, so just had a little fun.  But yeah, rolling for gold is a fun way to add to monotonous tasks.
---
Obvious Troll post 🙄
---
Prayer of mending. God I miss it. And circle of healing.
---
&gt;I'd say the game itself is horde biased
---
Most know if they don't get in the organized pvp groups they are going to spend a lot of their time at 60 losing. That's why they pretend ganking while everyone is still leveling is PVP.
---
I'd say that the majority (probably 95%+) of players began WoW "with nobody to play with". You make friends along the way.
---
People are what make classic WoW good. It's basically a "friend finder" but with a leveling mini-game.
---
You serious? Cause my post is serious.
---
I'm not saying they don't, but personally I have more fun playing with the camera further away so I can see people around me.
---
If you're not worried for the most optimal specc why dont you just go for it?
---
letting tank drop and using the largest heal(also best HPM with no healing) will let you stay outside the 5sr to regen more mana.
---
Goth’a
---
This is outdated since September 19th
---
Yea I guess so. But that’s why disenchant probably is better at later levels.
---
I think the opposite. Pretty sure that's exactly why most people roll a DPS. I've no clue how someone can fail at wow by doing exactly what their role demands.
---
yes but you nees to get out of combat before food, you can get 1-2 tics of cannibalize in before you get out of combat, can make the difference
---
I saw Sandra Bulock as a warlock yesterday and laughed more than i should
---
Depends really. For him those who hate him could go onto his stream to harass and snipe him. But to him it's all view count and more money for him. Nothing hes doing is really career ending it just generates buzz which gets more people onto his stream. 
---
Best thing to do really is ignore him and report if/when he steps outa line.
---
i mean between the dot ticking
---
Would have upvoted, but downvoted since you asked for it so nicely :)
---
You are so cool btw. Next time I want to be a sad loser, I'll imitate you.
---
You can, but you'll only be able to use one Backstab per mob until you get KS as it'll be Ambush&gt;Gouge&gt;BS. I'd say you'd be better off waiting until you're a bit higher level. 
---
Riposte in the Combat tree does 150% weapon damage just like Backstab, disarms the target, has a mere 10 energy cost and just requires a parry to activate. You also get hit % in that tree too. For early on, you might as well use this.
---
Can someone not roll a night elf and have that kind of name? Didn’t know it was exclusive to undead
---
To add further, for single target you don't need any threat help, for aoe tanking the engineering shield with thorium spikes is the best thing you can get
---
I would never game on a laptop so I can't speak as to what you'd probably prefer, but my view of the situation is that you're going to be on the game for possibly several hours a day (possibly MANY hours a day), the question then becomes: Is a cooling pad (I'm not strictly sure what this is, but I'm guessing it's to help cool the laptop) not a good investment for improving the quality of the thing you'll be doing for several hours a day?
---
For example for myself, I bought a TV and hooked up my PC to it so I could watch movies and play games on a big screen. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows and honestly I'd rather be comfortable while I'm spending hours on my favorite activity.

Specced full Shadow on my Priest at 41. Find it somewhat boring to run instances with it. Is it smart/doable at efficient way to level 50-60 with full Holy spec running only instances as a healer?
---
I find it hard to maintain solid mana pool when healing as Shadow spec (mostly because of 0 prot talent warrior tanks and people rushing content)
---
Am I going to be missing out on huge amount of gold by not doing quests?
---
Taking note. I will give it a llook
---
It’s cause people who roll a 3 after doing this aren’t eager on posting it on Reddit.
---
Yeah fair enough, I dig it
---
Thats just retail players.

Waste of talent points.

I'm 35. If I'm dating girls who live with their parents, I have more serious problems than whether or not I'm currently playing WoW.

So weird that it does that for alliance, when alliance have wetlands as well.
---
If you’re talking about Princess, yes. The entire dungeon tho? No.
---
I'm sorry I'm very much so new to classic I didn't understand your comment other than level 48 should be a good time for fury once  I have thrash blade and I don't understand the rest sorry.
---
Leveling a warrior is horrible, get used to it.
---
I’m referring to the literal 40 threat caused by fiery vs the ~50 threat cause by crusader on two wildly different proc chances. Also how much extra rage would that be? 2 extra a swing, or 1 extra every 3? All this is important information.
---
I'm playing alone as a holy Paladin on a horde dominated server so I'm having fun
---
Why didn’t you grab hemo..?
---
What kind of a priest doesn’t have Inner Fire and also doesn’t use PW:Shield when seeing an enemy warrior ? Or at least fear them, or something
---
I played Horde exclusively on retail for eight years and it was nowhere near as bad.  But I like having the odds against me.
---
I’ve had a lot of issues while tanking, particularly as it relates to DPS wanting to AoE everything and not wanting to CC (for a while there the mages were HORRIFICALLY bad, now they’re just occasionally ignorant/still overdoing the AoE), but I’ve mostly found that people will listen if you take some initiative to lead.  
---
Granted, I’m 60 and have been for a while, so your mileage may vary depending on your level.  Additionally, yeah, I know I’m basically saying “tanking isn’t that bad if you put in two or three times the effort that anyone else is and are confident enough to lead and not get rattled”, which doesn’t entirely refute what you’re saying, hah.  
---
I suppose the point I really want to make is that communicating with your party is important, and establishing that early and often can make your runs a lot smoother.  Getting your party to notice early on that you’re 1) a human being, behind a keyboard, even if it doesn’t look like it at first, and 2) not an idiot, seems to really help.
---
All of that being said, yeah, some people are just dicks.
---
Most Rogues won’t replace the neck till Naxx. 
---
Casters will replace the ring next week. 
---
I think you know the right thing to do. Just state the loot rules beforehand.
---
Also, str gives you additional damage blocked
---
Just make a macro and you'll always PP if you can.

    /cast Cheap Shot
---
And to anyone wondering "Will I not lose the loot if I don't pick it up while pick pocketing?" - No you won't. If pick pocket is cast you get to loot the mob twice, once for the loot and once for the picked pockets. 
---
On the private servers you lost your loot but not here.
---
What is this sorcery
---
Thank you so much for your work! I've got the map open nearly all the time when playing classic.

However, I have noticed two missing flight paths for the Alliance: It's possible to directly fly from Nijel's Point to Stonetalon Peak, and from Stonetalon Peak to Astranaar.

Mage joke
---
How do I respec? Hunter trainer has only one line: "I seek training..."
---
Edit: solved, seems like you can only respec in the capital.
---
I'm levelling with daggers. Slow out in the world but a lot of fun in dungeons. 
---
One problem is there aren't many daggers in the game. I'm just making that part of the journey though, trying to hunt down all the daggers I can find. 
---
Remember you can always respec so give it a go.
---
They are stupidly overpowered. 
---
They constantly get aggro in dungeons, because they don’t watch their threat. Often ending up wiping the group. 
---
They fire blast to steal your mobs while questing and take over a huge area with their stupid OP AOE grinding. 
---
They are hella annoying in dungeons for many different reason
---
Most people look down on them because they are so easy to play. You stand still and press one button (frostbolt) and still do top dps. 
---
It’s a massively overpopulated class. Making it even worse because they are everywhere you go. Most dungeon groups have several of them. 
---
They are literally immortal in many situations. Frost nova, blink, ice block, cold snap and repeat. 
---
When you group up with them and shit hits the fan they frost nova and blink away while you get stuck, dazed and confused, dying alone while they lololol from a distance. 
---
I find myself thinking of mage players as children, or even animals. “Be a good mage and give daddy alpha warrior some food” /pat
---
Playing with a mage is like babysitting a troubled child. You’re running around trying to fix their mistakes while going “Nonono, please don’t do that! Don’t break that, stop!!”
---
Try rolling a tank and tell me you don’t hate mages. I guarantee you, you will.
---
ah
---
 Noone should be allowed to play the game in any way aside from the pure wholesome clean way approved by the good and decent manchildren of /classicwow
---
Herod is 70/30 in favor of Horde.
---
&gt;Man really got me there and proved all my points wrong. Facts are facts but yall just want to be mad. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Threatening someone's wife and going out of there way to find where someone lives is far worse human being.
---
That just further proves my point, the death threat guys are. most likely stream viewers as well, as I said the whole streaming scene is filled with mentally impaired people
---
Yes, 5 to be exact. But again, that’s not at all what I’m asking about.
---
Wildly different amounts of rage indeed - unless you're already stacking mad hit gear while leveling, you're pretty much constantly rage starved while dual wielding in my experience. Your offhand is a slot machine at best and your mainhand generates less than what a 2H would.
---
Maybe wrong version? Works great for me!
---
I can't find this addon on twitch, where do you download it?
---
There's a gambling addon for retail, its a good time
---
Heh I just made a horde alt on that server! I'm usually alliance but a buddy is playing horde so I figured a first time for everything. Maybe I'll run into you one day!
---
Where I can see server population?
---
Normally I would agree with you,  but in this case it's kinda warranted. It's huge differences between Classic (vanilla+) and Retail. Like someone said, you can write a 500 page essay on the differences. There are also several videos, write ups etc about the differences.

Your group will determine what you’re “able” to heal. As shadow spec, you should be fine till BRD LBRS/UBRS. If you are healing the “spellcleave” groups in the 50ish range then holy will be your friend. If not, be clear on your late game spec (shadow dps or heals etc) and make sure groups just know your end game goals. You can heal fine as shadow till about 56 ish regular groups depending on your gear. Just choose a spec past that and roll with it :)

have a sook lol

In my experience it’s hardly that bad, but the ability priority 2H vs dual-wielding changed drastically as well...
---
Edit: I’m sorry I’m really tired and I’m having a hard time focusing. What is the narrative you’re getting at? Are you trying to say that 2H actually generates more rage, or are you trying to strike up a conversation in a reddit thread?

Im gonna assume that the warlocks people come across that refuse to hand out healthstones or SS anyone but themselves are new to the game and do not understand things. I have heard players in my guild say that they have had mages flat out refuse to give them water in five mans. Personally, if i was in a group where the mage refused to give water or warlock refused to SS anyone but themselves, I would politely bow out or ask the group to replace said player, as they are tipping their hand as ti the type of player they are going to be.
---
this so much. im tanking as a ret pally and dps freaks out when they pull aggro after immediately dpsing a mob 0.1 seconds after its been pulled. meanwhile my auto attack hasn't even gone off
---
Reddit is magic.
---
You think so? Genuinely asking
---
Depends on if you're horde or alliance. Like some others said, arms is superior for dungeons. So if you won't raid right when you hit 60, stay arms for the dungeons you will do. 
---
However, you should spec fury (right) before your first raid. Horde should be 2h fury (assuming equal gear--if you can get 2 doombringers while your only 2h is some blue axe, go 1h) and alliance should be 1h/dual wield fury.
---
you are ruining the circle jerk
---
Fuck this sub reddit and their stupid privacy rules. It's hard af to keep track of what's going on. Also why protect assholes?

https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community Is this the majority? No it's not.
---
The scaling hurts a lot since gear doesn't amplify your 2 damage abilities (auto and Seal of Command) as much as other classes, but it's also just the toolkit in general. You go OOM in raids if you spam Consecration (which you need to to stay "competitive"), your damage is incredibly RNG, etc etc.

It's probably people trying to dupe inexperienced players who are trying to play the AH game - list random items that don't appear often at 30-50g for a week that have a trivial deposit cost then suddenly list a couple at 3-5g. Inexperienced players will see the item listed as 10% of its price and go "Oooo what a bargain I can flip that".
---
yeah the straight one.
---
Exactly. If you’re gonna need on a green to vendor it, I’m certainly going to do so as well and tell the whole group to also need, or even better replace the greedy dude/duddet would be a better solution.
---
Unless the group agrees on passing on greens to a enchanter to DE for mats that’s simple ninjaing to vendor for gold.
---
Lol, wait till you're 60 and you are trying to find an UBRS.
---
That’s just how supply and demand works though :) 
---
If you’re the only person on the server that can make it, you better charge an appropriate fee!
---
Also are usually some serious “grass is always greener” issues.  For example, you stop playing a warrior because warrior leveling sucks or because they can’t farm at 60, so then you go play a mage, but you realize that you don’t want to just hit 1 button mindlessly in raids, so you roll a priest to heal raids at 60, but then you realize that holy priests suck at farming too so you go hunter, but then you see that hunters do mediocre dps, etc. etc.  
---
For some people the issues extend to faction/server as well, which is even more terrifying.
---
I think they could find all the spots in a few years.
---
Idk, I think Hunters are still pretty bad.

---
This guy doesnt know what hes talking about. A totem twisting enhance is the best option to put in a melee group. The amount of raid dps the enhance provides far outweighs the amount of damage a pure dps class could provide. 
---
This is assuming you have enough melee to warrant one.

If you were in a group with them then you are a mage trying to spellcleave and are just salty it didn't work, ironically blaming the other mages who you did it with who in turn blamed you.
---
OR
---
You aren't a mage and encountered one of the many idiots trying to spellcleave with randos in a group with less than 4 mages, so it was never going to work.

Spellcleaving isn't dumb, it's popular. Know the difference.

You can try the rp pve. It's more casual. Very much ally sided though. But that's cool for you.

I knew plenty of edgy teens who rolled alliance back in the day (my friends and I lol) so I guess I just see it as there's edge all over.

---
Do you rewrite rule when it fit your need ?
---
"Don't play hybrid classes" in general is good advice for most people. It is a struggle. Not just because of the stigma involved, but just the gameplay in general. You have to try 2 and 3 times as hard as the rogue players who will be topping the damage charts, you'll have to compete with others for gear that's arguably a smaller upgrade on you, and in PvP you'll get creamed by equally skilled players.
---
It's not impossible to find a raid and you're not 100% useless but your enjoyment of the game will be significantly impacted unless you're going in with the mentality that you're the underdog about the overcome challenges and really enjoy the aesthetics of whatever spec it is you're playing.
---
So yes in general that's good advice and the fact that you can clear the easiest raids in the game with those specs isn't really proof of anything. It's a struggle and you're still weaker than everyone else. This is coming from someone who just grabbed the epic plate gloves from MC as a ret paladin.
---
You got that right. I remember trying to get my hands on the cookbook at level (20?) and the experience going like *AAAAAAAAAAA OH MY GOD STOP CHASING ME OH MY GOD STOP SHOOTING LIGHTNING BOLTS OH MY GOD WHY IS THERE A PACK OF THEM OH MY GOD THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!*
---
After about a hundred deaths later and wearing nothing but dust (I didn't think to unequip until AFTER almost everything broke) I got the flight path and the stupid book. You'd think the trolls would've made mint and started selling that stupid thing world wide what with it being a requirement for *every* chef.
---
You gotta start making your bed, it's good practice.  Routine is important.
---
Be honest, I bet you got a store bought bidet hookup that ain't even hooked up to the hot water, huh?  (Or maybe you are just not a yankee)
---
It doesn't really show how you made 20g...care to explain?
---
That’s awesome! Sad to see you rolled the class I hate the most in the game. But pettiness can be put aside in congratulating a player reaching 60 for the first time :) GZ
---
It's not? I never had an issue always carrying the ss bag - always found it super helpful to have a crap ton considering pvp is a thing, you don't always get the option to stop and gather soulstones over long term fights.
---
Skulls are not a thing in my experience tanks don’t bother, even if I ask for it
---
"You need those shoulders or swords hurr?"
---
Uhh frankly, yes.
---
"Sorry bro."
---
Wow, I wish my guild let us roll on good gear. It's all loot council.
---
Another thing to consider is that the healing from crusader, if it causes threat at all, should be aoe threat. However, overhealing does not cause threat. 
---
The rage generation formula is known. You can look at that and know that crusader will give about 14 dps (7str=1dps) and see how much damage you will get from that. Remember that from crusader you will get 1. Increased damage and 2. More rage from that increased damage.note that  1 damage =1 threat before modifiers like dstance. Then calculate threat/rage (sunder armor threat is also known. Battle shout can be a better choice in some situations but we can use sunder as a baseline) and that should be all the information you need to see the value of crusader. On mobile and very late atm so I hope I didnt miss anything.
---
I'm trying to write a super simple addon that equips a bunch of gear based on a command I type. I'm looking through the [API for Classic](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API) and it seems it's not possible to equip item by name, just by ID slot. Has anyone got any experience doing this? I just want to feed it a list of items and have it equip them.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/025300105-32030500205001-05023013
---
I'd do something like this. Start by going Combat all the way to Blade Flurry. Then Assasinstion up to full Lethality. Then Subtlety, if you really want Ambush.
---
Hahaha
---
wPvP yes, but BGs, Alliance have Paladins. That's pretty OP. Horde usually wins organised PvP not because of racials, but because the casual gamers on Alliance probably don't have as much time.
---
But end game PvE is amazing for alliance. More dps, closer raids/instances.
---
this lmao
---
Maybe if you guys didn’t all think that alliance gets owned by default and actually rolled on pvp servers instead of circlejerking on a pve realm it would be balanced.
---
I mean, people say "we're all the same, faction doesn't matter" but on my alliance main server people are generally mature and polite and on my horde alt both world and LFG is a constant stream of people trying to be edgy and spamming every channel in the game with cringy shit.
---
I mean - that’s just bad luck.  No one is kicking rogues for bad dps - which was probably the point of the reddit post you mention.  Paladins get kicked all the time (or just not invited) because they’ll roll on gear the tank wants - it happens to everyone.  But the hybrid also gets kicked because his dps sucks.
---
Palas are by no means bad to have in a raid. Holy palas pretty much always top the charts. But *ret* palas are fairly bad. Sure, not in MC, but maybe in AQ and onwards.
---
Relatable content 10/10

Get a melee cleave grip. Just make sure you have blade flurry.

Theres a video about this on YouTube somewhere. I'm sure if you search "classic subtlety leveling" you'll find it

You must be super high. Uldir normal in BfA was easier than deadmines on classic. In retail dungeons you don’t even have to be awake to finish it.

So rare to see a genuinely good White rapper. This shit slaps!

---
yeah the alliance refugee server
---
Hey, thanks for the in-depth tip!
---
By HS you mean heroic strike, and HmS you mean Hamstring right?
---
My concern is that I'm not supposed to heroic strike due to threat generation, though I'm guessing your tip is for solo leveling?
---
Thank you for the breakdown!
---
It's in a rap song! Plead the fifth!!!
---
I’ve been in loads of ubrs rend runs with multiple rogues.  Seems fine for them to get a group.
---
you need therapy my guy
---
But you can trade them for gold
---
Omg, I did ding for 60 yesterday turning the quest to this exact npc in EPL, what are the chances!
---
You can do MC in full greens. Just chill with pre bis it’s not that important
---
Did “reddit” say that?  I seem to remember shitloads of people saying that was bullshit and of course it would go.
---
He asks about low levels and you say shield slam lol.
---
Mirage have way more horde players than pyrewood. Still slightly alliance favoured
---
I went straight to improved Ambush since that’s my opener move 95% of the time. If that doesn’t crit, then I just slice and dice and rupture the target down. My main combo builder is still sinister Strike as I haven’t put any point elsewhere but I’ve been eyeing the skill trees to change that BUT it’s not needed. I usually kill a target pretty quick with Ambush/backstab and don’t need to worry about combo points. 
---
This also works very well in a group. Just stay in the tanks main target and you don’t have to worry about aggro. Backstab comes in handy in groups as I’ll open with Ambush then follow up with backstab then use slice and dice with those two combo points. Apply rupture as applicable or save the energy for backstab depending on how much health the target has. 
---
If it’s a boss, I’ll open with Ambush then immediately use slice and dice build about 3 or 4 combo points to apply rupture, rebuild a combo point for slice and dice, rinse repeat.
---
Stay arms until you MT a raid
---
Because its done by blizzard and there is no risk of banning. Therefore ALOT more people will do it. How do you not already know this? Come on now...

He's not saying its different than buying from a seller. He's saying neither should be allowed, and buying a seller isn't allowed because it's permaban when you're caught.
---
Been trying to get [Silverlane’s Family Seal] from SFK for one of our guildies, were at run 15ish with no drop just the sceptre.
---
Does Us being mid 30s carrying and them being on level effect the drop rate?
---
Mirage is far from low. Currently it is full, and it is only 12:44
---
You could literally clear ubrs with that group.  It’s just gonna suck.
---
Totally read that as lower health mob, my bad.
---
Same, after switching to horde I feel like horde has it better in nearly every contested zone.
---
Whoever told you you can’t tank was a fucking idiot.
---
Yes, yes and no, can do hs in dungeons. But honestly might aswell tank, no need to spec prot. just smack em with you 2h
---
But... You can't have shamans and pallys in the same group.
---
Dude, I started laughing at crucial points in the story, I jumped at a part where I described bouncing, and I even blinked when describing something disappearing...

---
I've been getting into classic with my friend whose never played wow before and typically avoids mmos. He's been having a really good time as his undead warrior and we've levelled together up to 25. My biggest issue with this though has been his tanking, as I'm a priest and constantly pull agro off of him just with my healing spells. He struggles to hold down more than two mobs at a time and I don't want to be an asshole and show him tanking videos, but yesterday we came incredibly close to a wipe on Arugal and now I kinda want him to switch to dps. He's really loving classic and I think by telling him what to do he'll quickly lose interest, but I don't know what to do because we always get a bit bogged down in dungeons. Any advice?
---
I didn't Say it was optimal but it's good enough to end the leveling with and get used to fury dps.
---
Okay
---
Let’s see if that’s true within 6 months

I rolled a warrior tank from the beginning because I love to tank and I've been there done that with a druid already.
---
At the moment I have to DPS because I'm slightly behind the others in the guild level wise and we have an excellent druid tank.
---
It's nice to know I can get into PUGs easily but I've done my share and holy fuck I'd rather go grind yellow mobs as a warrior than do anymore PUGs, so that advantage is out the window.
---
No.  Enhance brings nothing useful that wouldn’t be better off as a resto.
---
I mean do whatever you want - it’s MC - super easy shit.  But don’t spread misinformation.
---
I would say if you're not in a guild that is trying to get realm first or try hard speed runs, then loot council is bad. It's great at funneling gear to certain players for the best of the raid but it relies on having a knowledgeable council. Mc is easy there is no need to have loot council to progress on the content, to me I would not join a guild with loot council in classic unless I was on it.
---
You can and should stay arms for all content until you raid
---
" If you were in a group with them then you are a mage trying to spellcleave and are just salty it didn't work, ironically blaming the other mages who you did it with who in turn blamed you. "

If the Guy is Happy with his Axe and its what he wanted to achieve, why the fuck would you think that It wasnt worth It? To each their own, not all of us are chasing a list of clear goals of bis gear and obtain the Epic mount as fast as posible some of us just want to play and chill.
---
I'm thinking of trying wow classic out. Have never played it before. Is this mainly a solo game, or at what level do people start teaming up to tackle mobs?
---
With all those people it must have stalagged a lot.
---
Playing Horde on Nethergarde Keep, server seems balanced well (perhaps bit more Alliance than Horde) and community feels friendly, so can consider that. Has been High/Full on population for weeks, but no queues so far.
---
this is video #23945672 about this....
---
It’s about elemental fire they go for 3g on my realm. You don’t farm the charms for profit you farm the elemental fire
---
Is that becoming a thing? I noticed that anytime I enter a dungeon with one mage (or even two) neither of them is buffing Int.
---
I even make sure to ask a few times but all I get is silence.
---
I don't know what this is, but it's s huge fucking bummer.
---
Hahaha that's awesome
---
Truth
---
Price difference: people farm the fire mobs more for the elemental fire because it sells very well. While farming the fire they get a lot of fire charms as well and sell them.
---
It is possible, I checked it myself before posting.
---
First experience of that was when AQ first released and the servers crashed because of all the people. I was there when it happened (I usually miss a lot of these events), it was awesome.
---
The first 5 levels of weapon skill are critically important. Skill past that is much reduced in value such that a human should never use edgemasters.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Yes, after playing with mages. If you know any support groups for victims of retarded mages, let me know.
---
No worries
---
2 water per cast if level appropriate skill learned.
---
Water fills 50% of your bar, make 10 waters, drink 2.  
---
Half the dungeon is over and you're still making water for the group. 
---
Y ppl get irritated
---
I still do it if people ask, otherwise they can have 6000000000000000000 level down a rank waters for what its worth.  
---
It's a pain to cast it 65 times for yourself, 65 times for everyone in the group, there is no reason to act like this sure, but its damned tedious.  People should be willing to pay a small tip, even if it's just a few silver.  Incentivize them and you'll maybe get some not so shitty water, lol.
---
Is there an addon that allows you to move action bars around but still keep the default UI look? I basically want the exact same as default but I want my right bars to be horizontal above my bottom ones stacked up. Dominos/Bartender alters the UI too much.
---
He said he was human. That makes edgemasters trash if he is using swords or maces (and he should be)
---
I make my gold through tailoring. Runecloth and Mooncloth bags make maybe 20-30s profit each if i buy the mats off the AH. Its not amazing money but its something.
---
For grinding, i go to the scourge camp in NE Epl. The mobs are easy to kill and the money is better than nothing.
---
I am also leveling a Hunter alt specifically for farming.
---
For me its shift clicking to inspect an item, so everytime I see a 5/6g green boe weapon drop shift click, easy money.
---
Average lol, people who dont play you mean
---
Who hurt u lmfao
---
There's a blzde rewarded from a quest in a dungeon that has 30 dps and + attack power as a bonus but can't recall it's name.
---
Dual wielding it with Thrash Blade is decent. Not optimal but a good start, I leveled with them from 50 and kept them for 24 hours of ig Time. Thrash Blade is the bis until some level 60 weapon with 4% drop rate
---
imagine clicking the wrong box though LMAO

My favorite is when multiple people have the quest and each person loots the quest item. Like oh hey we looted his head 5 times.

no

Only if you think that ppl that are not playing for 6 hours or more are "not playing"

Just download the classic dB addon and you will see for yourself
---
Seems to be alliance in every server. Actively avoid pvp. See someone getting ganked? Should they help? Fuck no, too busy questing to help fellow players.

(Although this was a fair 1v1, so they shouldn't help there, I'm referring to people getting ganked while questing)

I rerolled from a rogue at 40. Never looking back. Already almost doubled its gold from filling in dungeons. I’m loving Classic as a tank now
---
Honestly do what you feel is right. I have Tailoring on my priest but stayed far away from Enchanting because it just eats your money, and got Skinning instead. 
---
I'd actually suggest keeping Tailoring and just dropping Ench for a gathering profession. Tailoring gives you some really good items, especially Robes of the Archmage (I mean that robe is so good that clothies even feel they're kinda *required* to have Tailoring!). It is bind on pickup but you can drop Tailoring after crafting it for another end-game prof like Engineering. 
---
However, this is just a suggestion, so if you really hate Tailoring you should go with your gut! It's a game, don't afraid to make it more enjoyable to you.
---
You should use a 2h if you want to have any rage at all
---
Problem with this is before kidney shot if your ambush isn't critting 90% of the time your just a sword rogue with daggers. I'm not sure going past imp backstab will net much benefit to make up for losing opportunity, stealth speed and ambush Crit.

single moms play horde since tbc actually, and they all rolled female trolls for classic

This one goes to 11.
---
Is your guild focused on playing the auction house? I think it would be a cool goal to amass as much gold as possible without farming.
---
Fucking allly on noggenfogger...
---
SM, ZF and BRD have all been a struggle. But id like to think that the strife makes people less likely to leave once theyre in because they know getting back will be a chore
---
Most of the videos i found were talking about front stabbing, that's why i came here to hopefully get up to date info. If you know if a decent guide that doesn't use front stabbing I'm all for it.

What’re the clothes?
---
It's been over a month, low level zones and dungeons are ghost towns, guilds are filling up with majority of 60 players doing 40 man raids, people who actually matter for the game is close to or 60.
---
Try to see what specifically he is doing wrong and give him targeted advice. If you just say to git good or switch roles, it'll more than likely just discourage him.
---
Also, wiping on Arugal is pretty common if you're not all high enough. He hits hard, and will target everyone.
---
Nice backpedal :D
---
Try capping the frame rate at  60 you probably run the game at more then 60.
---
On my i7 rtx 2080 It runs at 180 fps uncapped at 1440p

alright, at that point you're just being picky.

did you forget that people honor farm in the open world too?

r14 grind is actually harder for horde since there's more people gunning for it
---
Stupid question I feel like I should already know, but how do I calculate all of my stat ratings, including hit and crit chance? Do I just need to manually go over my gear and add it up myself?

Uh what? I was asking why that guy I responded to didn’t think so.

I don't get this.

For PVE casters should all have better items by now.
---
For warriors it's bis for a very long time.
---
For rogues/hunters it's bis untill nefarian.

If that works out exactly like it sounds this could change the whole meta regarding leveling spec and HS use.

rogues can deadzone warriors and still get destroyed by them*
---
you're nuts if you think rogues have an advantage in bgs

"Because queering doesn't make the world work" Ultimate Warrior.
---
I think I've read people have actually gotten temporary bans for this.
---
I'll try, but my issue is that I've never tanked as a warrior and don't know his abilities that well. I've looked up some guides and given him advice but it doesn't seem to be all that helpful. Like I said he's not a bad tank, but I've played classic with a guardian druid who could sit there and keep 4 mobs glued to him
---
We mainly play the Auction house, but not necessarily focus on it. I try to make it a place to make deals outside of the AH. since everyone here is a bank alt, you can make a deal with other bank alts faster and without the loosing the AH cut. we have around 200 bank alts atm in the guild which is considered the bigger Bank alt guild in Razorgore.
---
Playing on Linux too and to be fair I had a small problem installing the battle.net launcher on Lutris, because the installer had the wrong file name. Easily solved by using a manually downloaded installer, but not exactly click&amp;play (in this case anyway).
---
No they are not ghost towns 
---
Maybe on lower pop  servers but they are still super popular on mograin
---
The new ppl that are starting now probably matter more for the games longevity than the dungeon spamming nerds that are 60 for a few weeks now
---
And yet again just check the average via addon  it's either lvl 1 to 5 because of  bank chars  a big spike around 38 to 45 and another one on 60
---
Downvoted to keep it at 60 upvotes
---
Ya but unlike that shaman, I can pull 4 mobs at level 45 with level 13 pants and not even sweat.
---
I'm one of the most efficient (fuck you mages) solo grinders.  I haven't bought drinks outside of instances ever.
---
Shamans are pretty well equipped to solo stuff but I don't need anything but a decent bow to plow through content.
---
Priest healer here, decided to not bother with First Aid either. Maybe there are situations where it might be useful but I have not encountered any yet. (This is about *healers*, not general advice btw!)
---
says the dude who lives in a mud hut
---
Type to play horde, that’s for sure.
---
When i played on a private server i NEVER got the Main Hand of the Dal'Rend Swords for my rogue..
---
It’s more about portability for me. I hate gaming on the sofa but I like to spend time with my wife. The cooling pad means an extra thing to constantly be moving from room to room and it’s already tedious enough with my bulky laptop power adapter. 
---
I don’t typically game on laptops but my PC is broken and waiting on a RMA from corsair to fix it for me, and in the meantime using my company laptop!
---
This is so dumb, what if the player killed the guard that would normally aggro that spot? You would want them banned?
---
I always considered that part doubtful but awesome in its own way. Image Sally then having to walk through the bloodstained halls and having to ressurect her comrades in arms time and time again.
---
I would personally suggest the opposite, making friends is much easier in classic than in retail.
---
So tired of posts like these because all the comments are people arguing back and forth as if your faction choice says something about you. Alliance players are people, horde players are people. Nothing else. No faction is worse than the other. They're pixels people.
---
There are lots of native Linux games though, and SteamPlay (which is basically Wine+) has reduced the complexity of playing non-native games a lot.
---
ehem...
---
i'm a bad rogue who doesnt know Alliance racials. 
---
i'm sorry. :C
---
Found the PKing rogue
---
Yeah, you should never really game on a laptop. Manufacturers lie to you when they say 'gaming' laptop. Sure it will run the games you want, but what they don't tell you is that all of the heat building up while you are playing will melt the hardware inside.
---
Even with a cooling tray you may need to replace some of the hardware due to failure from heat. But it should last a hell of a lot longer.
---
In other words you can be carried through content
---
There is a Chrome plugin called Picture-in-Picture allowing this for plenty of sites using just Alt-P.
---
If that works out exactly like it sounds this could change the whole meta regarding leveling specs and HS use.
---
No shit, idiot.
---
Zombie?
---
Bank char with clothes? I feel sorry for you
---
Wait for him to do it then, takes all his manna for 4 or 5 people and maybe it was a dumb gogogo group.  If he still won't, ignore.
---
Out of all specs labeled meme, bear tank does not deserve the label. It’s legit for most bosses except like 4 horsemen in Naxxx. I forgot the other exceptions, so enjoy that playable mini boss on haters.
---
Strange scenario. 
---
1. Human warriors should never have edgemasters
---
2. Human + edgies would give +12 weapon skill if using swords. Would that give .04*12=0.48% bonus crit? How do you get 1.28%?
---
It will be just like retail is now. Short queues for Alliance, long queues for Horde. Once in the BG Horde will win most of the time.
---
In this case it's not bug abuses, but game mechanic, so no. The player who chooses to kill the guards and loses rep can do this do have a save spot.
---
Do not dual wield at 20, dw is horrible until you get a lot of hit.
---
I'm healer so yes I'm picky.  I choose friendly and polite people over rude and ignorant ones.  I have limited time to play and getting in groups with second mentioned maximizes the risk of not finishing dung ... or having a good time.  That's one of the reasons I have rerolled priest ... having a chance to pick a group isn't really a perk that rogues have.
---
I dont think itd a 3 by default. I think it chechs your specs and maked the recommended the default. My default was 6-7
---
Lol what are you complaining about? Warlock is one of the easiest PvP classes.
---
Wait seriously? I only saw 10 as the highest, if I can try higher I'm definitely eager to see what the game can do!
---
You must be on a bad server.
---
Perfectly viable though can get mind numbing after a while.
---
Don't be gatekeeping! I'm a few months shy of 30 and I bought my wife a gaming rig full of rgb. Nothing wrong with a bit of color!
---
There's literally a few of us!
---
Sorry if I came around sounding like an asshole, It wasnt my intention, only that It baffled me how somebody posted that he crafted a very iconic weapon back in the day and ppl are like should've bought the mount friend that weapon is rubbish. Well maybe the dude doesnt have time or a decent schedule to farm out a better weapon un dungeons, or maybe he's just nostalgic because he had the AR back in the day. I think his orc looks badass, and arcanite reaper is one of the coolest looking weapons of all time.
---
No ChAnGeS!
---
for lower-level enemies its crap and I'm not sure about same-level enemies
---
Edit: you may still be leveling it seems. In not sure if its crap if you dont have hit gear
---
My guild has 0 druids atm.
---
Hate to go all stackoverflow on you, but what are you trying to accomplish?
---
No.  8 min cd.
---
Can you report people for stuff like this?
---
Did you actually watch the video?
---
He goes into depth about how the limited choices in Classic can actually make it feel more free, and specifically mentions it maintaining the illusion of a "world" better than modern WoW. He also calls out the referential style of Cataclysm specifically.
---
It really seems like you just skipped around for a bit and drew a conclusion.
---
No.  Running over and over looking for a drops is sometimes not the best idea.  I usually give it two runs and then move on leveling.
---
I prefer the red one. The timber and the other grey one look too much like the Frostwolf Howler. 
---
Being tauren it's kinda prestige to have a distinct orc wolf.
---
Hillsbrad? All the Alliance quests are 10 levels higher than Horde quests in the zone.
---
Horde players are people, alliance players are people. There's no difference. Everyone who says differently is biased by their faction choice. That this is a discussion we need to have every single day is beyond me.
---
and where does that gold come from?
---
https://youtu.be/voEgv4Ql2bU
---
Succubus? What? AFAIK only the Hederine Slayer (the fel guards) drop the eye. 
---
I killed like 6 of these guards with a friend to get my eye. Quite lucky.
---
sure but just because it's not allowed doesn't mean it won't happen.
---
Not sure if it works for classic but for retail you had an addon called MoveEverything. You might want to check that out
---
S C A R L E T  M O N A S T E R Y
---
I always just tell the priest don’t worry about healing me between pulls. I just first aid it if I need. Funny thing is most seem to to be more than happy to pop a renew, which is great
---
I've leveled toons on both factions. Horde ganks more, Alliance camps more.
---
A 50% solution is good enough for these knuckledraggers who wallow in mediocrity.
---
Just like you cant expect levelling a warrior to be easy, you cant expect raiding as a boomchicken to be easy.
---
Class identity necessitates different strengths and weaknesses :)
---
I think there is an addon for this!
---
you got any evidence to back up your claim? I'll admit to you this, yes more people will be inclined to buy it from blizzard but how much more?
---
Also wow tokens don't have nearly as much negative impact on the economy because people aren't spending 16 hours a day farming gold and devaluing a regular player's money
---
Pretty silly but, rolling horde shaman, and can’t decide between orc or Tauren. Tauren looks so much cooler in my opinion, but the animations feel slow and I hate the kodo mounts. I prefer the orc animations and running, but prefer the overall look of shaman gear on a Tauren. What do y’all think?
---
Side question: I heard a wolf mount will be coming with Alterac Valley in phase 3 rideable by Tauren? If so I’d almost definitely roll Tauren. Any answers would be appreciated!
---
That’s a good meme you fool. This item is only in classic WoW.
---
I’m on a 2080 TI with ram and processor to match and it started me off at a 3 as well. I was like “What? Are you kidding? Lol, no no no no. Max settings, thank you.”
---
You mean the part where he correctly identifies that Classic has a narrow progression funnel that can stymie players who don't have an interest in rerolling? The thing that's an intentional and objective part of it's design?
---
Alliance just can't handle the bants
---
weird flex but ok
---
You guys remember day 1 when 1 g was like 20 usd? xD
---
I hand out water and open ports for anyone that asks.  No payment is expected.  Cyonara-Stalagg
---
yea it seems that Azeroths finest heroes are just a pack of  sociopath serial killers who loves to chop their victims
---
Yeah your character can only have a certain number of buffs and some have priority over others, this includes enchants and item effects.    So one of them is getting overwritten and causing you to lose some healing.    
---
Blizzard has been working on a fix for it for a couple weeks.
---
You can farm dungeons just fine as any spec
---
It woks, i tried it, thing is, if you are trying to do the /sit way, it’s a bit tricky. It wont give you a stack for getting crit while sitting down. It will give you a stack if you get hit while you are shifting from /sit to /stand. If you get hit between the shifting phases, you will get crit, and you will get a stack. Just need a bit of practice. What i do is /sit macro when he jjst attacked me, than as soon as you finish sitting down, move forward a bit. You will stand up and move forward and will be attacked and crited. And gaina reckoning stack.
---
Looks like a lot of fun. I noticed you had a tricky time targeting the other players, you should try using TAB, each time you press it, it cycles through nearby enemies- tab targeting. It's easier than trying to click on a player who is moving around or even blocked by terrain. Works on NPCs, not just players- just be careful in dungeons because you can sometimes fireball the wrong mob and cause a wipe :D
---
Are you essentially play dice?
---
How about you come say that to my face?!
---
...just let me clean up first this place is a mess...
---
You barely ever get more than 2 orbs
---
When they clear the dungeon to get to the locked chest on their own? They are free to have it all to themselves.
---
nvm, apparently it does work now. Saw it was updated yesterday and  it seems to work with classic now. Thanks!
---
The single continuous flightpath is the longer one, by about a minute.
---
How is it not necessary? You don't find replying to people's greeting necessary?  I suppose you are right, however,  I find it rude so I rather leave to save myself from trouble.
---
That's a dick move, fam. Not something you should really be bragging about.
---
If he is doing tanking the sword and bord way there is not much he can do. In low levels tanking is fucked up. just some random points:
---
- He shall spec Arms till 40, not a single point in prot. 
---
- He shall spec into Anger Management 
---
- He shall not use heroic strike
---
- Most thred is generated by sunder armor, shield bash and revenge.
---
- Taunt is Part of the Rotation.
---
- Do not shield him, he needs rage
---
Because Blizzard thought players would prefer the 1.12 version. Shrug.
---
Very strange. Last couple hours people seem to think rogues are easily beat by warlocks. Maybe at level 42....
---
Oh no! People are having fun and sharing it with us! How can we ever make it stop?! Oh the hue manitee!
---
/s
---
how can you even tank without stance swapping?
---
You might think that, until you polymorph a druid and it wanders around as a sheep for 12 seconds.
---
4 in our raid group and 1 is a feral
---
You can't get stunned by mobs if you backtrack, while if you try to move away with your back turned you can, right? (I'm a spriest so I do a lot of mild backtracking to let them get in mindflay range while first GCD passes, things like that)
---
Dwarf on Stallag... Sometime i wonder if im a mosochist
---
"Guys ive never had a caster get a cast off before. Today I died for first time ever because this warlock figured out how to cast with no cast time. Wtf? Is it worth playing a rogue?"- rogues at level 42
---
Idk. Maybe it imported my setting from retail then
---
Nice. I accidentally vendored mine on my 47 warr.
---
Just googled the brand. Holy moly the prices are crazy!
---
Horde has more quests there and it's easily closer to horde territory. I think it's kind of a wash.
---
Blasted lands is the only alliance favored zone I can think of... But really it sucks anyway, most of the quest there are just an inconvenience anyway.
---
I actually do think 1-29 is better for alliance but 1-30 has a huge advantage for horde.
---
ah yes, TOS break
---
I felt the same way with my pally, fisrt with Verigan's fist and now with the Rock Pulverizer. Both have a great impact in the efectiveness of your build and class fantasy.
---
For both I had help from random people that were in the area and took some time off to help my with my quest.
---
Classic is just the best
---
it's not even a hundred extra attack power over regular ass untalented totem (that a resto shaman can provide), and only for the windfury hits. any warrior offtank can hold the nightfall. please stop spreading misinformation, a competent player on an enhance shaman is a nice way to not waste loot for an open minded guild, but you're joking if you think it's the "best option" ever.
---
HoRdE gEt GaNkEd ToO
---
For most pulls a shield is detrimental since you won't be able to keep threat up.
---
TIL an especially clever play on words = mad.
---
I bet people are happy taking 200g from you, doubt the shame even matters
---
It's the best we got, since everything is taken down, so his is just  pure speculations.
---
Sik, good tattoo idea as well!
---
I'm saying being that overly sensitive to not being greeted may result in missed opportunities for you. It's not like healers are that rare either so you're not exactly sticking it to them.
---
&gt; How is it not necessary? You don't find replying to people's greeting necessary?
---
If someone joins the group, says "hello" and then gets a hello back from one or two other people in the group, I don't see how it's necessarily that important for every single person to say hello, especially if they're busy trying to find another player or something. Imagine if 40-mans worked like that, if everybody had to individually greet every single player that joins? It's ridiculous.
---
Clearly you don't if you claim that it doesn't work. Because it does.
---
probably meant rune cloth
---
It's absolutely not for horde hunters. And just because it's on a bis list doesn't mean it's equally important for each class. A hunter has plenty of alternatives to get stats on his melee slot and is probably better off farming the important pieces instead of rolling against 4 melees in a UBRS raid.
---
Only resto druids can work for the branch manager.
---
Really good idea to post the names here. Rolling for gold is not allowed :D
---
You should have filmed it with Shadowplay.
---
100% this. I say enrage on CD, no rage.  I pull, 1 attacks misses...dps aoe...mobs everywhere. I cant hold threat off of thorns alone. Gotta give me chance to get some rage
---
How to feel better: Go on your main, go to a low level horde zone. Kill everything in sight for about 30 minutes. Go back to your alt with a smile on your face.
---
Then the poor horde victims does the same thing. It’s the perfect cycle of hatred.
---
Really?? how do you do all that? the only way for you to have that much access would be to either be that person, OR be blizzard which I doubt you are either
---
AV wolf is ridable by tauren, so is the PvP raptor.  In classic where mounts that stand out are rare, having a tauren with the frostwolf howler and/or black war raptor makes you a pretty unique standout.
---
I got my entire gear set in 5 runs, tabard still took 25 tries though.
---
I wish horde got something similar :(
---
So true
---
Yeah I love Questie. Never played WoW before, but if I didn’t have Questie I would be really lost
---
Is disenchanting stuff basically gambling? I have an addon which shows the value for disenchanting, but a lot of times I just get dust which is worth 20% of the vendor price?
---
No
---
100 - glancing chance - miss chance
---
No glancing for hunters so I suppose theoretical 99% crit cap. For melee 99 - whatever glancing chance is
---
Druid tanks are super rare but honestly feel better for 5 mans than warriors. Its just that 90%+ of druids are resto.
---
I've seen the elevators at thunderbluff doing the same thing!
---
Going to second this. Loot council basically only works well when 25-30+ people are ok spending 100's of hours raiding on the promise of getting loot someday.
---
Any addon that can help me see finished/unfinished quest in wow classic?
---
What evidence do you want? The fact that more people do something if it's legal? That's just logic my friend... Let's ban alcohol, what happens? Sure there will be those that still do it, but the fact that it is now illegal is a deterrent to the majority. I know that we are comparing different things here but the principal is the same.
---
With regards to devaluing player cash, just look at retail... Like I said before people know there are guys there that but tokens/monet, so that nice purple goes on the AH for 2mill.
---
This is so dirty ... didn't they say they will ban devislaurs mafia collusions ??All the evidence is here
---
enjoy your 30 minute BG queue times
---
Just avoid any servers with known streamers.
---
Grobbulus, an NA RP server has a troll only guild, Mon. 
---
My half orc half troll shaman aspires to join their Glorious guildnone day
---
Ty! I made that decision, because I was maining mage in d2 and d3 as well. So I thought I will be very comfortable with it and I don't regret the choice.   
---
I really find some interesting aspects on druid and hunter, which is why I will definitely play them.
---
Started with the druid already Lvl 10
---
yeah, it makes literally no since why someone would get a tradable item just because they can equip it. by the same logic I should need on everything as a warrior right?
---
So true.

---
I forgot how awful tanking can be in classic. I play a hunter and got in some groups and all the tank were working their asses of to hold thread. People pulled without him, casted before he could even land a single hit and blame them. Its not fun and hard if you not that good. I understand every warri who just wants to do dps from time to time
---
We do it all the time in raids and parties. But we have the gambling addon
---
That's my exact experience with Horde now though, and I say that as someone who has mained Horde since vanilla. 1v1 they leave you alone, until you're low health or in the middle of a dangerous situation. 2+v1 all the sudden they act like gladiators of wPvP., That orc shaman that's been grinding mobs peacefully with you is now ready to fight you with his friends. 
---
Both sides do it, all it takes is a small percentage of players to be that way and it will feel like they all do it. To be completely fair though, Horde out numbers Alliance on almost every server.
---
It's pve who cares lol
---
Does it pay off to fish so long?Seems rare fish are much cheaper then in vanilla
---
Looks like the neck from Nefarian is better for dps.
---
Casters need to be lucky with drops and rolls from full mc clears to replace it.
---
Unless ofc there are better dungeon rings, which is what im asking.
---
I'm still not convinced.
---
There probably aren't any tracked quests when the Questie tracker is disabled at first. Try shift-click in the quest log, which should add a check-mark behind the quest and add it to the Blizzard tracker.
---
You need around 30 seconds or more of dot uptime to maximize your mana efficiency.
---
Any uptime on a dot as the mob dies is wasted.  Destruction is more focused on shadowbolts for damage and will have less wasted mana at the end of a fight.
---
Hi, /u/Kodos-
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/de25uf/1_month_in_and_i_still_cant_decide_on_a_main/). 
---
I’m almost the opposite. I levelled a warrior up to 50 with the intention of being tank/prot in endgame but I’ve just rerolled a warlock.
---
I actually really enjoy tanking and on the whole have enjoyed the tanking journey to 50. What’s caused me to reroll is the realisation that, while tanks for dungeons are in high demand, it will be difficult to find a tanking spot in raids. On top of that, I don’t have much interest in being a dps warrior and fighting against 50% of the population for loot.
---
I might be terribly mistaken but isnt there some quest giver that lets you exchange your mount for another?
---
(from brown to black etc)
---
Heroic Strike threat generation isn't the problem, it's that it causes your next auto to *not generate* rage, on top of spending it.
---
As a mage telling people no when they ask for water is absolutely hilarious. Some instantly lose their shit, other just think you're a prick. Luckily for them after I have seen their reaction I give them as much water as I have :)
---
I posted some random instructions you get for a quest to the AH.  I set the BO at 1000g and the bid at 1c.  Made 51c.
---
Practical Magic, it fits!
---
But isn't this just attacking from outside the aggro range? That's a game mechanic not a bug abuse. In booty Bay guards spawn if you attack someone else. Are gadgetzan guards the same? If not and you need to actually aggro them the same way you'd aggro other mobs, then this isn't an exploit.
---
I will happily pay all fees to the flight master for the priviledge of hitting my bong while I am flown there. 🤓
---
Well tbh I leveled the Mage purely to learn proper AoE farming techniques - DME Lasher Farm, Elementals and ZG Bijou Farming. By the time I was afking in cities I had thousands of gold. I could take it but it felt pointless and more of a principal thing :P
---
Funny, after my experience in Hillsbrad, dying almost during every quest, I don't have much sympathy for alliance being ganked, especially when it's in a protective area like Darkshire. 
---
Yeah, pathing exploits are bad and should be banned.  Report and move on.
---
How do you get your quest interface to show like this? The default interface is awful with modern resolutions!
---
What does BiS mean? I keep seeing it pop up in posts and comments
---
I've heard if you hit the mob with the skull marker on it, your account gets banned.  That said, I've never seen a DPS player hit the marked mob, so who knows.
---
If the player is sufficiently low level the game scales the fort buff to their level and the mana cost.  You can’t drop a 70 stam buff on a level 10 or 20, for example.
---
addon called questlogex
---
so true lol
---
That poor Goldarn rolling 25 and 5... :(
---
Yeah lmao, there hasn't been a single zone where I was killed by Alliance 10 levels higher than me than in Hillsbrad. That's where I started to write down names of people who ganked me so I could hunt their ass down once I was max level.
---
my /played is 5 days at level 50 but keep reaching
---
When did they ever say that?
---
Best (item) in slot
---
Grats bud! :)
---
Neck from Nef is rare and bis forever. Most rogues will never get it.
---
There’s plenty of better rings from dungeons.
---
"lFm mAgE sPellCleaVe"
---
Why don't you open a branch model with your guild. Basically alt is in each region where no nearby vendors or banks are available. You charge a certain fee to store people's item for a while. These people can claim there items again from another location after paying the fees. So people won't have to run back to banks all the time. Also you could get items that people want to vendor and pay them cash on spot lower than the vendor value and later keep the difference as profit. This will mostly work in questing and farming areas.
---
I've heard it's not against the tos anymore, I dont agree with it but it was against the tos in original classic not this version.  People have checked
---
https://i.imgur.com/V3B9leH.jpg
---
Post from a gm stating the same.
---
Warriors need 8 of them for the quest. He has 48 which is divisible by 8. Seems like a decent time to stop.
---
In a guild run i would agree for melee to get priority since its more beneficial for the guild. In a random group, where we all join to get our pre-raid BiS to start raid with our guild yes i would roll, because there is no benefit for me if a non-guild melee get it... its the best item for me to start raiding and thats enough for me to roll.
---
this is why gnome mage = best mage
---
Seriously, getting rid of aux ports is the most dumb 'innovation' ever
---
For Priest/Warlock, yeah, where 90% of your enemies are undead who instantly racial out of your fear.
---
It's about the intention behind neutral towns. In them anyone should be "save". In case someone is hostile to a player of the other faction all guards should be hostile to him for a time and the guards in range should attack this special someone. 
---
Now, if this someone first attacks the guards to have a guards free area he is an outlaw that payed with his reputation for this crime. So he is free to attack players in the guard free zone he created. However if he leaves this zone too early the other guards should still be hostile.
---
Now, if this special someone finds a spot where either the guards don't turn hostile or the hostile guards cannot reach him it is exploiting the game mechanics and therefore banable.
---
This hurts my eyes
---
I dont get the meaning of it, could you explain what it is further?
---
When I was lvl 34, me and my lvl 36 buddy (both mages) were getting corpse camped by a 60 undead mage on our way to SM, and we couldn't get set up properly together because he was immediately killing both of us on spawn. 
---
Finally, my 36 mage buddy managed to at least heal and Mana up before the 60 undead mage found him, and he fought back. He managed to get the 60 to 15% health 1v1 because the mage was so garbage, but unfortunately he got resisted and couldn't finish him off. 
---
After that the 60 ud mage realised he could just run up to us and spam AE and we couldn't do anything about it because of resists/ no interupt potential. Oh well
---
Disenchanting an item usually rolls on a drop table, with something like 3-4 different items. Check out some items in wowhead and click the disenchant tab, you can see each item and the chances of it dropping
---
Yup, you could have lower level members who want to levelup do this for some extra cash, so they can afford a mount. However, enforcement would be an issue. Especially cheaters. You can even advertise this service and leave an alt account in every region. So when people need this service they will contact the guild for service. Some dedicated people could log into these alts and then provide the service. Therefore, you won't need to have people that have to keep alts constantly logged in.
---
You can even start a protection racket lol. Open a guild in opposing faction that hunts people. Have few accounts in your current faction that tells them if they want protection from such issues then they should pay up to quest or farm peacefully. This might be quite doable and fun lol.
---
After corpsemaker i took mograins might from Cath. 
---
Theres a hammer that can drop from the final boss of Uld thats really good.
---
Im currently 54 and using the staff from ZF that can proc stuns. I switch between that and a 2 hander axe that gives +beast slaying. The axe is a quest reward for killing gorillas in Ungoro
---
Yeah, it's just so aesthetically wrong.
---
What addon are you using for getting the market price of an item? Super cool!
---
You usually want to turn and run sideways instead. You move much faster, and you don't usually get dazed if they hit your side, especially if you turn very slightly toward them.
---
This means HS does not suffer off-hand penalty?
---
Yep, I had a great group for BRD just now. The group leader needed HoJ, the hunter wanted that arena chestpiece. Before I was invited I was asked whether I want either of these, but I only wanted Second Wind from Golem and then he invited a mage who wanted the shoes from Golem and some ring from Arena.
---
me too
---
Sometimes I walk backwards into mobs to show dominance.
---
In this situation I'd go with the one that you dislike the least. You might prefer Tauren in shaman gear but you might also end up hating the animations/mount. Also, gear changes but animations do not (consumables aside).
---
To be honest, though, it sounds like you just want to play Tauren to me.
---
Yes I'm regretting rolling alliance on Sulfuras. Every fucking contested zone I go to feels like it's a Horde leveling zone. My Spy addon like like raid frames most of the time, meanwhile it's just me and my wife and maybe one or two other alliance.
---
Phase 2 is going to be unplayable for alliance and I'll likely end up quitting classic because of it.
---
Now you can use Q and E for something more useful.
---
Tanaris is a fun area for 45-50 imo
---
Badlands. Demon area of desolace. I wanna say swamp of sorrows. The area north of tarren mill. Run a few cath groups. You can heal is as shadow.
---
It's still here. I simply put this here in error. However, lay off the attacks.
---
Second this, my naked troll needs an upgrade on his looks.
---
And if you wanna run ZF from time to time you’re already there :)
---
no its not. especially if you run multiple dungeons.
---
you can sit down for a fraction of a second and get the "drink tick" then move on to not lose time
---
Trying to hide gold buying i see nice Alibi
---
Hunter
---
that's the 6 month sub, if you want to refund it just make a ticket
---
Ravager requires level 37, so you got time. I started running Armory at 36 and got the shoulders, helm and axe pretty fast, even with 3 other warriors in the group.
---
most of the time you dont need to buff stamina on all players in a group. 
---
Buff the tank and the melees and its usually fine.
---
Depends on gear. Lvl 20 first deadmine run I was lowest dps but got all warr gear. Equipped all of it and skilled it up. Then, second round. Highest dps by far (while also being the tank). All same level.
---
Is it really worth the repair bill?
---
THIS is the shit that makes me want to learn how to tank. Having a group by the balls, knowing that if things go south you can just bail and find a new group instantly.
---
Just ask yourself this - do you want to be big or huge?
---
Like you, arguing that since the item is marginally better for rogue/warrior, hunters should just cede all roles for it and not worry about their BIS.
---
It’s literally part of the mages job to act as a fridge guy isn’t gonna get many groups if he can’t preform his main function
---
That sounds great. I've been trying out the mainstream MMOs recently and found them to be kinda boring as it's mainly solo leveling
---
Arms is better for leveling. Even for tanking dungeons (you get Tactical mastery 5/5 early and can actually use  stuff like Overpower and Mocking blow mid-fight).  
---
And lvl 37 sounds like perfect time to replace that WW axe with [Bonebiter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter)
---
Should scale with AP.  Not many melee abilities have static damage.
---
It shows how much each month would be of you get 6 months at a time. You still pay the total price stated.
---
Well if that's true i agree with you, and it should be stated that melee and tank have priority on head before starting the raid. But are you really certain they will end up replacing it with a dungeon ring? :P
---
Stuck trying to settle on a main. Mostly interested in BGs when they're released and casualish raiding. Greatly prefer melee or at least physical dps.
---
* Rogue was the obvious choice but it feels like it might be a bad choice for battlegrounds because they're not that great in larger group PvP.
---
* I like the idea of hunters but not all the pet training/management plus it seems really punishing all of the time (kiting responsibility, even basic stuff like pets wiping the party/raid).
---
* Mage is an option but I don't love the fantasy or casters, they're clearly overpopulated and they almost seem a bit too convenient (portals, etc.).
---
I'm honestly at the point where I feel like there might not be a class for me to play which is sad becaused I was looking forward to Classic for a very long time. Any suggestions?
---
You never go afk from your keyboard for longer than expected and sat there wondering how long ago it was that someone whispered you...?
---
Skeram transfers too.
---
You get it back if it does sell, however
---
Yes the lowbies must pay for the sins of their fathers.
---
What is “x block” stat on shields? I found a shield with +1% block chance. Are they related? What is better?
---
If you are exalted with gadgetzan guards will be your buddies so it might be it.
---
Alright that sounds great. Level 10 doesn't sound that high. So hopefully I'll be able to group up with people quickly!
---
Oh. How do I get a refund?
---
It’s not irrational.
---
Looks like auctioneer.
---
You can choose to pay monthly ( which costs more per), every three months or every six months ( which costs the least per month). If you chose the multiple month option then it will draft your account for six months all at once
---
Then you're an idiot because they'll be the same ones not taking you to raid because you don't dps as much as rogue/warrior.  Fuck the class gatekeeping.  I have every right as a hunter to upgrades as any other class.
---
Also, we do more dps than enh shaman, so these same annoying people probably have no problem with you rolling on it.
---
It even says it right on the shop page, its 50£ which corresponds to 8£ per month. It also says it is paid every 6 months. 
---
All written there on the page.
---
57 Warrior here.
---
Spec is important, as others have mentioned Arms is just superior until end game, even for tanking Arms is the best spec for a long time.  Why? Improved Rend is actually nice at low levels.   Improved OVerpower and Deep Wounds gives you a big dps boost.  Best though is Tactical Mastery which is essential for tanking.  Being able to swap stances to use different abilties is a core aspect of Warrior'ing.  At level 30 you get Sweeping strikes which I use on every single pull.  Charge&gt; Get to 30 rage &gt; SS, then defensive stance and Demoralizing Shout.  After Level 36 Ill swap to Berserker and drop a WW for a huge threat boost before Defensive stance.  Mortal Strike at 40 is a powerful hit, and gives a great debuff that halves healing.
---
I struggled with tanking somewhat until the late 30s.  Threat just SUCKS for low level tanks, as you never have enough rage to generate threat. Luckily most elites at these levels don't hit that hard so I never care if a single mob is attacking a mail or leather class, especially if they are the one that pulls threat.   I put all my focus on making sure nothing is attacking the healer.  For everyone else it's their fault they pulled threat.  With a couple heals just about any dps class in this game can easily handle an elite on their own.
---
Weapon Skill is also a really important stat,  make sure his weapon skills are near max, and if he gets a weapon upgrade not to use it on bosses unless that weapons skill is also near max. Mobs/Bosses that are +2 and +3 are also SIGNIFICANTLY harder to tank for warriors. We miss a lot more on them, and do less damage to them and they do a lot more to us. Remember warriors have ZERO +hit.  
---
Get a good weapon swap macro, and use a 2h'er and only swap to a shield on big pulls or hard hitting mobs.  A 2h is also much better against caster mobs.   People love to bitch and moan about 2h tanking but I do so much more damage and threat on packs.  But, I always make sure to have that shield swap macro ready if I go below 50% health.
---
I use this:
---
/equip \[equipped:shield\] 2h Weapon Name
---
/stopmacro \[equipped: shields\]
---
/equipslot 16 Mainhand Weapon
---
/equipslot 17 Offhand or Shield Weapon Name.
---
If threat is a problem, Ill always use a 2h'er, if healer mana is an issue I use a shield.
---
It doesn't matter that's good for mage or not. At the end of the day it all depends on DKP. I just wanna say that don't be too greedy. Warlocks use pretty much the same gears as mages.
---
Now just do it 10 more times and you've got yourself a PvP video to post.
---
Not a fan of joining groups with reserved drops, but then again it's my choice to join or not if a group announces beforehand that those are the rules.
---
I'm on Razorgore, who do I need to /w to get my bank alt in your fine guild?
---
One reason for the 60 imbalance is that heartseeker was a newer server.  And the servers that fed it were some of the originals.  So there is a high chance that people who leveled fast transferred and are sitting at the top while the server chugs along.
---
Sm Cath - solid drops in there too for priests
---

It’s French, pronounced Blow-mheu.

He would always talk about how bad he was, but he would never listen to me when I gave him advice. Run the slow poison, not the one that stuns after 5 hits and DRs you to death, stack more haste, that crit isn't helping because you're energy starved all the time, use garrote or cheap shot more instead of always using ambush...
---
There are DOZENS of us!
---
They're also still levelling. Lots of us don't have the time commitment to hit 60 yet, meanwhile there's plenty of pugs for MC.
---
Calibri, you have to inject it into SharedMedia though
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about as Blizzard is already using 1.12 itemization - they are only progressively updating loot tables, not the itemization. 
---
I think what you actually mean is you want the 1.10 loot table updates in from phase 1 along with DM. You talk about it "hindering the game" but what do you actually mean by that? Making the game less easy? Because the loot from DM and 1.10 update is extremely powerful and would only serve to even further trivialise the early raiding content. The 1.10 loot especially is meant as a **catch-up mechanic** to get people into raiding quicker in the later content patches, similar to ZG and AQ20. Putting this in from the start would be truly idiotic. The game is easy enough already we don't need to go out of our way to make it even easier. It's this kind of thinking that ruined this game the first time around - let's make things easier, more convenient, more accessible, etc. until eventually the game is devoid of any soul. Blizzard are already using the updated 1.12 itemization which makes things easier compared to progressive itemization, it would be seriously detrimental to remove progressive loot tables as well. 
---
It's not all just about difficulty either. A lot of the loot you can get from DM and 1.10 is actually better than what's available in MC. These few months before DM is out should be treasured because MC loot is actually meaningful. Getting good loot is one of the primary motivations to raid for the vast majority of people; removing this would *actually* hinder the game. As a thought experiment, imagine if you could get a full set of better than T3 gear from pre-raid 5 mans. Do you think people would enjoy Naxx as much? Of fucking course not - it would ruin the game. The same principle should be applied to 1.10 loot - it is good as a catch-up mechanic for people starting late in the game, but it should **absolutely not** be added from the start.
---
Right.  Because Duskwood = Hillsbrad on a pvp server.  I lost track of the times I died in Hillsbrad.  My coworker was ganked, maybe twice in Duskwood for the same level range.  Gtfo about your imbalance.
---
Well speaking as someone who played vanilla, tokens would break the economy. Especially since gold sellers would continue. Gold sellers hurt the economy greatly back then. Inflation was bad.
---
The fundamental question here is: do you want to heal in PvE?
---
Yes? Shaman. No? Hunter. Don't mind? Then it comes down to class fantasy and playstyle.
---
I always launch through steam when using my phone.
---
I was thinking that, which dungeon would be the best to run?
---
I also have a pally and a druid tank that I'm leveling and are both much easier for dungeon tanking.
---
Look at this guy getting all the caster rings to drop on every boss in mc
---
Damn. That was my first thought!
---
There is a better axe that drops in scholo with better stats and more weapon dmg that costs 0  :)
---
For 700g you could just use the axe from anger forge and wait until emp drops his or you get one from raiding. Your dps will be carried by those who are on weapon priority. Before you tell me those axes are bad, I know that. But going from one of those axes to an arcanite reaper just isn't justifiable at that price. I'm sorry
---
Okay but come back once you have actually played there, theres a reason no horde player levels i Ungoro on Gehennas and it aint the faction balance. Or google classic devilsaur mafia xD
---
 if i want to go with beaststalker 4 piece instead of the bislist what parts should i wear? boots belt wrist shoulder? 
---
Main question is, is it worth it?
---
why would gold sellers continue when being undercut by blizzard?
---
I've not seen a gold seller in years on retail
---
Classic caps at 20 yards. So there is not any way to get it to be further.

I don't think any of them were supposed to.  Tuesday is the release day.  Mine still shows as processing.

A lot of the alliance from incendius left to heart seeker too.
---
Rolled a mage because that's what I played in Vanilla. I've got no problem doing portals in cities for a few silver to cover the reagent cost or handing out water to my groups. Though I do get a little annoyed about people just opening a trade window out in the world and not saying anything.
---
I kind of regret my class choice now because I'm lumped in with these asshats. I'm also finding that some groups are surprised I can't AoE slow with Blizzard. I'm 31 arcane / 20 frost which is my optimal raid spec yet they act like I'm clueless because I can't do what they saw on twitch.
---
How do I do that? Sorry, I don't really know what to do.
---
Your art is incredible dude
---
Kinda true.  I didn't have like any upgrades hardly from 30-50.  Maraudon has tons of stuff for us though, and that gets us to pretty much raid ready excluding some of the annoying grinds in the BRD/LBRS/UBRS.
---
B&amp;F on Biggles?
---
Not for the current price. He could have bought edgemasters or lionheart with that gold or more importantly for phase 1, his epic mount. Dps in mc isn't exactly important right now. If he wants the item, good for him he should spend it how he wants to. I'm just saying, it's not worth it. Which you just can't argue. Farm emp for a decent 2h and wait for a raid weapon. Spend your gold on items that will last longer than a few weeks.
---
And then there's me that showed up to UBRS yesterday with 500 water already made and nobody needed it.   /sad
---
right click report them, safespotting so the guards cant hit you is bannable
---
Be patient with him. Tanking at low levels is really tough. Really SM Armory is the first instance where tanking becomes more natural and similar to endgame. 
---
You can just guide him in the right direction by making sure he is a proper spec (Arms), is using the correct abilities (sunder armor, shield block), and is geared correctly. Don’t give up on him!
---
Pretty sure that the way retail's economy is handled is because of combating gold sellers. Gold is earned so slowly in classic that there would likely till be gold sellers.
---
Edit to clarify: retail devalued gold by reducing the scarcity. This made gold sellers pointless because everyone had tons of easy to earn gold. 
---
In classic gold is hard to earn and takes time. Gold sellers will shorten this process. So unless the rate of gold earned increases in classic, there will still be gold sellers.
---
This is awesome! I’m on razorgore too.
---
Are you on Alliance or Horde? I’d love to join with my bank alt :D
---
&gt;not even PvP flagged
---
&gt;still casting Blizzard on PvP flagged players and not hitting them
---
Can confirm OP is telling the truth.
---
Who the fuck is "Staysafe"?
---
&gt;I'm such a retard,
---
Not necessarily. There was a time period recently in which one of the links on willit classic for SUF was the retail version and would obviously not work correctly. I had the same issue as you until I found a different source
---
Not sure if anyone has mentioned this in the thread, I've been using a program called OnTopReplica for the last few days. You can use it with any browser too.
---
https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica
---
Its all crap.  People are too obsessed with what guides say, min/maxing everything and what cutting edge guilds do.  The reality is just about every class and spec can raid in classic. Perhaps only a single spot or so but theres no reason to shut out a competent and dedicated player who wants to play a certain spec.
---
My guild in vanilla cleared 10/15 Naxx before TBC came and we had a shadow priest, ret pally, feral druid and pretty sure a boomkin too.  The absolute hardest thing about raiding in classic is maintaining a suitably geared and dedicated group of 40-50 people.  Its a lot of running old content because BIS is across all tiers, loot is sparce and burnout is real.
---
Id gladly take a competant ret pally or cat druid if theyre dedicated and show up consistently.  The top horde guild on our server used a bear druid as MT since the start and they were deep into Naxx too.
---
Came here to say this, I think they have like 500+ members already.
---
I'm french, we don't pronounce "Blau" "Blow" (germans do that, not exactly but kind of).
---
We just pronounce this "Blo"
---
I don't think you play hunter and are just exaggerating off what you've heard, because that's bullshit.  I go oom all the time, if you don't then you're basically just auto-attacking.  
---
Post 40 your pet's ability to tank is severely diminished.  So 4 mobs is going to be super try hard and you're going to need an extended recovery time with probably a bandage for you and your pet, plus drinking. Also our damage falls off a lot in that level range, mostly because there aren't any good bows until Verdant Keeper's Aim.  
---
Yeah, we're still efficient but gear is just as important to us as it is other classes.  If you're trying that 4 mob pull in 13 greens you're gonna get wrecked.
---
do you even read what you just wrote? None of it makes a lick of sense.
---
Wat
---
Undead immune to fear
---
I’m a mage. Have been for 15 years. I open up a trade, unasked, for anyone that joins my party when questing. If I could give them my mana agate, I would.  I can’t imagine having to buy all that water that I consume. Seriously fellow mages, get your act together. Share the wealth.
---
It works, but only sometimes. In reality, it's finicky to use because if you are autoattacking and get crit, it just resets your swing timer instead of hitting multiple times.
---
If you get crit at range and have autoattack on, you lose the swing.
---
I have found that it's just too janky to use in my experience. Maybe I'm wrong and it works perfectly for others, but it sure as hell doesn't for me.
---
Edit: after watching a recent video, it seems that all of the problems come from leaving autoattack on. If it's on and your swing is ready, but you are doing something that doesn't let you swing (like casting or being out of range) you just lose stored swings. It looks like the best way to deal with it is to manually toggle autoattack between each swing.
---
Pretty common, some aliance fucks some lowies while they quest and they login on to their mains and kick his ass.
---
Same reason why Karazhan is often lauded as the best raid in TBC: It had the lowest bar of entry, hence, many more people were able to experience it.
---
Definitely not worth it. AR was definitely not a 1.12 weapon, its heyday was like 1.3.
---
No, fuck entitled people like you.
---
Certain items need to be reserved if you want to have any chance of ever getting them, such as Rend main-hand. Let's say you do a Jed + Rend run and four people compete for Reed while only one competes for the main-hand. Reed has a 30% drop-rate; that's 7.5% chance for each of the four people to get it per run. That's still double the chance of the guy who reserved the main-hand getting his drop per run.
---
There is nothing wrong with reserving CERTAIN items that are impossibly hard to farm without.
---
And you do? 
---
Your just trolling to bait.  You either don't play the class or spent 10g in consumables once and it made you feel like you were good at video games.
---
How is paladin healing compared to the other healers during 15-60 dungeons?
---
If I am attacking it and you clearly see this and my intent then you're in the wrong.  Just because you have an instant cast and I have a cast time doesn't make your behaviour less rude.

no you need plate if your tanking at 60

Except it isnt.

When I heal, I like to pretend I am a ret paladin and autoattack 90% of the time. Idk if it beats watching Netflix on the side though.

Thanks, mate!

again, the people who did that before were the ones buying from gold sellers anyway

Classic! No pun intended lol

I've been using puggle. Its main figure is searching lfg chat for people looking for groups and grouping them together. But in addition it tracks anyone you've grouped with and you can give them a rating and leave a note for yourself
---
You're missing the point my man. This isn't about playtime. Tokens destroy economy. If you want the option to legitimately buy gold and bypass any kind of farm/grind/personal achievement, go play retail. If not, suck it up and earn your stripes.
---
Not any more serious than somebody who engages in world pvp?  I'm sorry but you seem to miss the part where they were the griefing person to begin with.
---
using terrain to avoid guard aggro is definitely bannable.
---
Yeah, no, you literally have no idea what youre talking about. Barrens forces you to jump zones around 20 because you run out of quests and get like 5 total quests from 20-25. If you're sitting in Barrens for 15 levels you're doing a lot of raw mob grinding or spamming WC. By that logic you can just go to Wetlands where Horde never go, and do the same thing there up to level 30, or grind Stockades.

Oh you gotta keep that staff skill up... plus it looks like you're helping!

I kind of had the same feeling when I was playing hunter around that level. Switched to a warlock and haven’t looked back. You have a bright future in lategame, bring some support and you solo level almost as easy as hunters. 
---
I know this is very personal, but I suggest to at least take a look at warlock before making a decision.
---
If you like healing and bringing supportive abilities to the team though, shaman 100%. I’ve also heard shaman lvling speeds up a lot around 32, there are few classes that can keep up with hunter leveling.

I gave em back before i left lmao. I thought it was funny as i had the axe equipped.. dude had no idea why people were trying to "steal his farm". Chill bro, never asked him for charms nor should he assume he can just bribe people to get what he wants..

Also, if you're stopping to drink all the time as a hunter you aren't being efficient.  Hunters Mark/SS and regen instead of drinking, 5 second rule works for hunters too.
---
Today me and 2 friends got a sweet world drop while doing Maraudon, an item called [Cassandra's Grace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13102/cassandras-grace). I was healing as paladin and thought I had just gotten this amazing, top of the line +healing ring. 
---
I equipped it and panicked when I didn't see it in my ring slot. Then I realized I had put it on my head, as it was a headpiece...
---
Why would you use the image of a ring for a headpiece??? WHY?? :(
---
I already made a ticket explaining myself hoping to get it tradeable again. Any chance this will actually happen? I'm not sure what the precedent is for these kinds of issues.
---
Ah I see. I misunderstood then. I've played both and I definitely see benefits to both for different circumstances. But as for demographics, I agree with you.
---
You can heal dungeons in feral spec. If you really want, keep a separate set of gear for healing and equip that when your picked as a healer
---
Just as good, and you don’t need to be Holy spec or anything. Just get some cheap gear with + int on it and you’re good
---
For rogues this is known as pickpocket time.
---
Is that an epic mount?
---
Kill worms/elites sell drops
---
Id play horde regardless of the situation. All of the alliance races are boring and law wise they seem to be the bad guys
---
*pbrook12 rolls 100 (1-100)*
---
Good riddance.
---
Yeah, watch the "Tomb of Sargeras end cinematic". There it shows how he did it.
---
Can horde use the Ony questline necklace that turns you into a Dragonkin for 15 min anywhere?
---
I remember years ago as ally I always had furbolg rod on me so I could be a sneaky furry rogue.
---
I think they can be competitive but they are extremely itemisation dependent since there is no skill whatsoever involved PVE wise and in PVP they are totally dependent on the critical randoms of shatter. If these don't happen the mage is as good as dead even before he steps into the battleground.
---
Exactly irrelevant spikes and then 60s
---
If I was forced to choose one or the other, probably Alliance.
---
You realize you’re repeating the same bullcrap tons of people repeat negatively like it’s wrong to do so.    Its an easy boss to farm and its worth it.  So many min/max haters out there... yikes
---
Do like all the noobs i guess and buy a warden staff and spam taunt because you cant keep aggro ?!  
---
The point of a feral tank is the impossibility to pull threat off of them ... if you can pull it off of them you might as well put a Fury tank on the job.
---
who the fuck reserves every green? more importantly, what morons would join that group?
---
Been busy with some life stuff and I have severe alt-itis in game. Got a few classes to level 20, made a few good friends on my server and think I've found my main. It's been a nice relaxing ride so far.
---
I mean, no offense man, but if you're not capable of at least reading the tooltip, that's kind of on you. 
---
On the bright side, it's actually an amazing, top of the line +healing head, so you might aswell just keep it.
---
Yeah as a druid healer I try to pop a rejuv every time I see a lock do it, and if I've been at pretty high mana thru the dungeon so far and there's not a big pull or boss coming up I throw a regrowth.
---
The only time I've been semi annoyed so far was when one guy was tapping during a moderately big pull and he was #2 on the threat meter, making me feel like I had to immediately throw a heal on him in case he drew aggro because he would have been 1 or 2 shotted.  Other than that, all the really terrible locks have existed only in stories for me, for which I am grateful.
---
Correct. Was introduced in Cata or WotLK.
---
Imagine being this entitled and you don't even have to farm mobs to get people to the dungeon.
---
This post brought to you by Warlock Crew.
---
I’ve been given water a couple times as a Druid, and I’m luckily low level enough to be efficient with it. I definitely don’t even need three stacks, maybe not even too depending how the run goes/how careful we are and if I dip into my own. Mage water lightens the load on the water I bring, it shouldn’t replace it.
---
That's awesome! Thanks for the info
---
Yeah, lol. Hillsbrad is brutal. Can’t really blame them though. Every Alliance player developed PTSD from being outnumbered 1:10 in STVietnam and Tanaris. 
---
I’m leveling an Alliance Warrior alt at the moment, on a full PvP realm. It’s infuriating at times.
---
People argue both ways and frankly either are viable. I’d even argue staging disc maintains a superior ability to heal should you want to dungeon farm for a while.
---
yeah, only trash hunters will roll for it against melee in group. good ones will make groups with melee who already got or do not want hoj, or with no melee at all. really good ones will solo farm it
---
Goblins, what you going to do...
---
English speakers Diphthongize the vowel (break it into two vowels) 
---
So blow from Americans is actually blou, with a very short u sound (perhaps more accurately a w sound) at the end, while in French the vowel represented by eau is just "o", a monophthong, a single vowel.
---
For brits it's more striking because (most) british "ow" is usually pretty far front, so it's like "uh"-"oo" in quick succession. Very unlike French "au".
---
I'm on NGK; it's almost 75% Alliance as of the last census.
---
I have, you're just choosing to ignore it because you don't agree with it.
---
The more gold available, the less value it carries. Tokens make gold alot more accessible and easy to obtain by throwing your wallet at the screen.
---
Let's say tokens have a value of 1000g. Ten people want to sell a token each and these 10 people wouldn't be able to farm or obtain 1000g by normal means, so they buy tokens for real money to sell for in game gold. 
---
A hardcore player comes along, he has the gear, he has the mounts he has the profession recipes and mats he has earned everything he wants/needs and has farmed more gold than he knows what to do with. Why not buy some tokens for free playtime? 10k that he doesn't need can be converted to nearly a years worth of game time so he snaps them up. 
---
Now 10 people have more buying power than they would normally have because they effectively bought 1000g each. So now there's 2 situations... 
---
1. More stuff is being bought on the AH, leading to more demand so more people farm popular stuff, creating more competition on the AH driving prices down. This would probably effect crafting mats and the like. 
---
2. The more rare lucrative elusive stuff will carry a much higher price tag than they would normally because people have cottoned on to the fact that the more fortunate among us have more money to burn and are much more likely to splash the in game cash. 
---
Of course this is just an example but a real outcome nonetheless.
---
I’m considering making an alliance alt on a horde dominated server. It can’t be ALL that bad....right?
---
It’s a BIS list for a reason; it’s the best setup.
---
You can wear what you want however, just realize it’s not BIS. The dungeon gear tends to lack the things you want; hit, crit, attack power. It’s why no one wears any of those pieces.
---
He did a number of things before heroic strike.
---
Hey, thanks! It's definately soloable (as a mage, atleast!) but not easy. I recommend farming it with a friend. It was my seventh kill or so while doing the Onyxia Attunement.
---
You're not, dude has the reading comprehension of a mentally deranged snail
---
A site doesn't exist for this because the most effective way to do it is to advertise in-game.  Sometimes you can advertise effectively on blizzard official realm forums, but in game is best for sure.  Most people are not going to look outside the game to find someone to craft something.  If I need a rare item crafted, lets say force reactive disk, I'm going to watch AH and see who's putting them up for sale.  Then I will send an in-game mail to that person and coordinate a combine.  Or if there are no items on AH, I will ask in trade chat every time I cross through a capitol city asking if anyone has it, or if anyone knows of a player who has it.
---
They are both bis for a handful of level 19 twinks.
---
Saw a Nikolas Mage.
---
Do you tip your healer after dungeons for healing?
---
You spend about 10 seconds drinking
---
When people remove you from the group for not buffing them, don't complain
---
I've had Crimson Felt Hat taken from me by a tank druid who wasn't even 60 so I feel that pain. That being said this guy was a complete spaz.
---
If they have a Succubus out, just don't even try it. One of my favorite past times is killing rogues who try to suprise gank. As a leveling warlock I get regularly ambushed by rogues and I simply: seduce while stunned -&gt; run to max distance -&gt; shadow bolt -&gt; fear -&gt; apply 4 DoTs -&gt; run away while he dies. I always save my death coil if this fails and immediately transition into a second fear and more dots after it falls off. If this fails, I still have a healthstone + healing pot that restores 90% of my HP. If that fails, I'll come back to life with my soulstone and apply even more dots. Maybe ganking warlocks will become more viable at 60 when you get geared up, but it will be hard while leveling.
---
Literally *every* strat group on my server.
---
I've already seen 2 or 3 people with it on Heartseeker.   Also seen two other posts on Reddit with a Tauren and a Dwarf.   There was a WoW forums post about an EU guild that has 3 players with it already as well, they were arguing whether they used exploits to get them.
---
Not to burst your bubble bud.
---
I had a holy paladin back in the day and absolutely loved healing dungeons. You don't have the benefit of HoTs, but single-target healing is next to none.
---
That said, we didn't have all this 'cleave' nonsense back then, so I'm not sure how paladins would fare in low level groups with such players. Only one way to find out though...
---
Its only hard mode because you need to find 4 others ally before attacking a questing horde 5v1.
---
Why do you assume you have more rights on a loot just because you have better gear?
---
thanks for the info
---
Thats why theres melee dps.  Tank + 2 melee can keep it going while you drink or wand.  It’s not the end of the world to have the mage do nothing for one pull.  So many people get triggered because we pulled and they are at half mana.  Just chill and go with the flow. Specially if its a melee heavy group.

Hey guys started leveling a warrior does anyone know any warrior specific addons or QoL macros?
---
&gt; The more gold available, the less value it carries. Tokens make gold alot more accessible and easy to obtain by throwing your wallet at the screen.
---
Tokens do not increase the overall gold present in an economy, you have yet to acknowledge you understand this.
---
&gt; More stuff is being bought on the AH, leading to more demand so more people farm popular stuff, creating more competition on the AH driving prices down. This would probably effect crafting mats and the like.
---
Overall buying power of the market has remained the same due to my above point. Money is just changing hands, not something rare or unusual.
---
&gt; The more rare lucrative elusive stuff will carry a much higher price tag than they would normally because people have cottoned on to the fact that the more fortunate among us have more money to burn and are much more likely to splash the in game cash.
---
Stuff doesn't become more expensive just because these few people suddenly have more gold than they would have. Sure one person may pay out the nose for an epic but that's few and far between and has VERY little effect on the economy since going alllllllll the way back to the original point: no gold is being created by tokens.
---
I mean, shouldn't the lock be using that same time to drink as well while the tank establishes threat?
---
I think a lock spamming life tap down to 10% hp then immediately blasting the next pack of mobs before a tank has established threat creates the exact type of situation we are talking about.
---
You don't know what meta is?
---
Use the wow forums or if your realm has a discord do it there. Those are the two logical places that had the most traffic.
---
Keep in mind it’s probably not going to get much attention unless you have the rarest of recipes such as a lion heart helm and the only one on the server to make it. Most everything but those couple recipes are meh and everyone has them.
---
Using trade chat is probably suitable.
---
Our guild is recruiting atm and we've got a shaman who wants to totem twist in raids and I asked him if he wanted to be a nightfall bot ... and he was really happy that I asked because that's exactly what he wants to do.
---
This is very well put. I think I've been focusing on the leveling aspect and not end game. Hunter will get me there sooner, but I really enjoyed healing back in the day on my paladin.
---
Only kids like color
---
Well if you believe some of the posts, the casual players are all bored of MC and waiting for BWL. Just that they got there more recently than the serious players.
---
I get about 2 hours a day to play what with my toddler and evening job. I have a 20 troll hunter and a 20 human pally.  Still enjoying myself just going at my own pace and doing a dungeon or two on weekends when the wife can keep toddler aggro off me long enough lol.
---
Yes, do damage and give out water.
---
Just wait until Phase 2 when mages get max rank water, then you'll be having a blast!
---
I ain’t no Druid brother
---
Carry a feral set, spec 0/30/21, be capable of both healing and tanking just fine. 
---
If you're not willing to do that, make friends with tanks or get a guild.
---
Not a Druid
---
ITs not good for tanking - If you plan to only tank, then sell. If you are human or orc - Sell. Any other class and wanting to DPS, keep em.
---
I am the collector, i collect pretty rocks
---
He might be the guy you see with a laptop at McDonald's using their wifi
---
I'd suggest this build: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005301-5050021303222151-05
---
It's great for tanking and questing as cat. It's not good as a DD in dungeons, as you don't have improved shred, but it's much easier to find a group as a tank anyway.
---
As noted you can heal in feral spec if you have some healing gear, at least up to BRD.
---
At 60 I reskilled a bit: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005301-5050011323212151-05
---
Feline Swiftness isn't mandatory anymore, you get more rage as a bear in higher level dungeons, so you don't need the second point in Primal Fury. For that you get Improved Shred, allowing you to make reasonable DPS in dungeons.
---
I'm gonna go with a "you don't have any clue what you're talking about" on that one chief

I played a lock cus i have no friends lol. If its fearable it soloable ;) imma check tonight wish me luck!

You sound like a horrible player

No taunt is pretty rough
---
I usually start running a second before i am mounted. I see the bar getting cancelef but I do mount up anyway
---
I healed a brd yesterday, the 2 mages made up for like 65-70% of the damage taken. Idc if you want to aoe, I’m down, but know how to actually do it. I had 1 mage one time single target dpsing and we pulled another big ass pack, he switched to aoe, but he keyed the shit outta them and barely got touched doing it. Just because you can blizzard doesn’t mean there isn’t a little bit of skill and knowledge that goes into it to make it work
---

---
22 ap for a druid is like 11 strenght lol there are better lvl 30 greens
---
Definitely give this game a try. People are grouping up at all levels. Once you hit level 14-15 you can start grouping up for dungeons like Wailing Caverns, Ragingfire Chasm, or Deadmines. Classic is very social so you won't have any problems grouping up with others.
---
Level feral. The build I recommend is the Hotw build, where you spec 0/30/21. For spec as you level, I went feral until I had 2/2 feline swiftness, then went 5/5 furor in the resto tree, then spend the rest in feral until 5/5 HotW. Play around with some talent calculators to decided the details, but most of the points don't specifically matter too much. As long as you have an armor/Stam/agi set, you can solo quest or tank any instance. If you have an int set you can heal. It's amazingly flexible.
---
Yeah but do you ever need to open just one bag?
---
No, its all going to be a joke and hybrid classes will easily clear.
---
They'll take twice as long because hybrid classes as dps are total shit, but they can still clear.
---
Mmmm, shallow and pedantic.
---
just an fyi 22 ap is shit at lvl 50 there are lvl 30 greens that give more
---
1st 2nd?
---
He’s gonna drain the bank once he gets high enough. It’ll be such a famous heist they make a movie of it.
---
I'm 44, keeping the same pace can I expect to hit 60 in a month?
---
Just hit 48 on my lock. Dungeon grinding makes it easier to play in bursts of 2 hours/day.
---
Surprisingly doing very well on gold.. levelled up engi to 260 and sold bombs on the AH that people are buying for some reason. Almost at 300g now.
---
I've played both factions equally and both factions are exactly the same in terms of aggression in world pvp.
---
there are lvl 30 greens that are better than that  for druids
---
Think that's bad?
---
Last few days I've had my LFG Macro set to "LFG UBRS - 16/17 Pre-Raid BiS, ONLY Need Drakk's ring, don't need it reserved."
---
And I've *still* had to wait an hour+ to find most groups, and 2 of the 4 groups in the last day have apparently been Jed/Rend runs that the leader of the group lied to me about (advertised in LFG as full runs, I asked twice since there was only 9 in group... Then 5 people bail after Rend because they were told it's just up to him)
---
Life is hard as a Rogue, but wouldn't trade it for anything yet.
---
(Also saying fuck it to Dal'rend and just grabbing a Krol Blade + Mirah's Song combo for now has helped.)
---
i remember from like 29-32 i leveled super slow.  not much content i could do other than SM GY since i was a little too low for STV and most of SM, but too high/ already finished lower level zones.  once you get more into your mid-upper 30s leveling starts going fast again with SM grind and lots of STV quests.
---
Can only use the necklace inside the cave in Dustwallow Marsh :/
---
My point is that it's a game where more then one class has to do something tedious to do their desired objective (in this case it's dungeon) and that charging people for that would be ridiculous because you are all trying to do the same thing after all. But I cba to argue anymore, it's not like it will change anything.
---
&gt; Rogue. Tanks.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think a lot of people are pretty hung up on the traditional tank, healer, 3 dps party structure that most of us learned on retail. Although it's generally effective, the utility that paladins bring with their various blessings allows unconventional parties to succeed.
---
&gt; I've been healing SM Cath/Arm runs all week as a pally healer. Blessing of Salvation can be used to effectively turn any class into a tank as you mitigate the threat of all others by a whole 30%. Blessing of Light buffs your heals against the newly designated "tank" to increase their healing received and counteract their comparatively low survivability. You could also give Might to a rogue for example to further increase their threat.
---
&gt; I've now healed several groups that either used a rogue (innately good dodge) or good mages (kiting) as tanks. I just wanted to put this out there for you other pally healers. If you're waiting a while on finding a tank but your group is open to ideas, give it a shot.
---
Glad to see more people are starting to realise there are more classes that can tank. As a shaman tank myself who is raid tanking, it's nice to people starting to open up to the idea. If you have any questions about Rogue tanking, warlock tanking, 
---
priest tanking, etc... let me know I've tanked quite a few raids.
---
hell, even a MAGE raid tank is a thing.
---
i prefer DKP with a huge decay for missing raids or not being on ime and prepared, as it rewards the most consistent players, which is the most important quality right now and for a very long time.
---
Is leader of true pack raid wide?
---
ezactly, thank you
---
Found the 15 year old retail player who watched one "what class to play in wow classic" video
---
If you have both his hands, is he a snake now?
---
Well, I understand what you're saying, and you're correct that we aren't generating more gold through tokens.
---
Now what YOU are failing to acknowledge/choosing to ignore is that alot more people have access to the gold that they wouldn't normally have access to.
---
Prices will definitely be affected by this, because people would seize the opportunity to take people's money. Say I want item X, I search on the AH and find that it's gonna be 100g because that is the accepted price on my realm. So im casual and 100g is not measly change for me so I am reluctant and probably don't buy it, I can't justify spending that amount.
---
If however I was able to obtain and sell tokens? 100g is trash ill throw it out and if my gold gets low I'll just buy and sell another token GG.
---
People that play the AH notice that me and others are spending more, and capitalise on it... Because why sell it for 100g when people would easily pay 150+ because gold isn't as much of a problem for the time strapped player anymore, because of outside influences (big fat juicy wallet).
---
Surely you understand this?
---
 Irl- in England the minimum wage goes up, lovely great news! Businesses know that people now have more money so guess what? That can of coke just increased in price because people are more willing to pay it, because they have more cash.

I mean any moonkin guild could clear naxx. It'll just take longer.

Are there any addons that I can put stat weights in and compare gear using?

you right.  make that: " just got level 45 water"
---
Sounds like you don’t lead groups oftenly.  I lead them and have no trouble finding people to fill my groups.   8am or 10 pm , there’s always people that want to join... maybe there’s more to it than what you’re leading on?!  Are you toxic or overly demanding ? If you say “ LFM MARA QUEST RUN 47+”    You might get less luck with finding members than if you’re not picky at all and bring w/e you can find and make it work.  I’ve made great friends that way , people that were slightly too low level but i dragged then along and did the run slightly slower.  They are greatful and im happy my quests are done.

That’s a paddlin

Why doesn't another rival mafia form to counter them? Could be fun, huge cross faction battles over dinosaur corpses

Are you interested in any of the end game professions? You may want to look at the associated factions.

Hunter, rogue, mage, warlock for an alt? Currently playing Paladin without the best farming potential. It isn't bad but all of the above classes have unique or more powerful farming potential. Hunter has a ton of unique farming spots and it will grow even more when Dire Maul comes out. I want to get exalted with ravenholdt and getting other people to farm lockboxes sounds like it would cost an arm and a leg. Mage is obviously strong for farming and you can keep him in a city to sell ports and such. Warlock can farm some elite demons for one of the priest eyes for the benediction questline and can sell portals.
---
Gotta get his feet too
---
&gt; Edit to clarify: retail devalued gold by reducing the scarcity. This made gold sellers pointless because everyone had tons of easy to earn gold.
---
That makes 0 sense, if the gold was less scarce then it's the same for the gold seller as well, all they do is sell you more gold per dollar.
---
Like a sentient fire.  Sorta just sways about, probably knockbacks by using his face now.

Levelled a Mage to 32, realized I was fooling myself and made a priest. I'm level 27 now, looking forward to go to BFD for the wand and Gnomer for the Robe.
---
what server do you play on? i just don't believe you lmao.  no ones gonna join a group that's announcing they are taking every piece of loot
---
Laaaame
---
I'm level 48 and getting distracted by Destiny 2. :D
---
Don't worry, the mages didn't stick together, the mobs are everywhere and the wipe is imminent.
---
Only group iirc so you’ll be out in group with the fury warrs.
---
Just a matter of time till we have a post revealing  YOU CAN CHANGE KEYBINDS IN THE MENU!
---
I hate this add on. It has wasted so much time during raids while trying to get people to buff and get ready between pulls.
---
Depends on whether it's an RPPvP server.
---
People generally don't want to roleplay as hunched over uggos, apparently.
---
Oh man. I still remember getting that back in the day. It was like the only thing I got from those raids. Just loaded up my lock the other day and had a weird moment of nostalgia at seeing it in my bag haha. Great times.
---
I’m currently doing Leatherworking but it seems really unprofitable so I was considering dropping it for something else. Which professions are considered end game professions?
---
Lol y’all find some shitty cleave groups I swear. If the mages all group up from a distance you actually don’t even need a tank anymore. It’s the same mechanics as solo AOEing where the mobs don’t ever actually reach you.
---
Feed ur pet
---
Hey im about to get exalted with argent dawn, is there any juicy rewards for me to get?
---
50 to 60 was way easier, and plus you can start gearing for 60 at this point. Yeah you have to earn that same amount of exp but you acquire it faster. So many dungeons as well. I hit a major lul until I could start running ZF
---
Depends on the server. Something like stalagg might actually be unplayable right now especially after the recent transfer waves lol
---
I'm playing with my wife and this is her first pc game. We've been ganked but when we see a lonely horde she says "if they start attacking we can fight but I don't want to bother someone minding their own business."
---
I was like "*wife*, the only time they start fights is if there's 12 of them with at least a 5 level advantage"
---
Haven't been wrong yet (except one baddy rogue who thought he was gonna make a twitch clip but sprinted away after hitting twice).
---
Btw this is per zone mostly.. like in IF I still definitely have layers, need to invite to pt to trade and stuff. In most high level questing zones it feels like 1 layer. I tried to layer in tenaris to find more mining nodes but can’t
---
I play on Firemaw EU Horde side, most time i see both horde and alliance just run past each other, i do the same.
---
I got ganked and camped a few time by higher level and there was a rouge who picked of me and my group after large murloc pull and we were all low and one was dead. After that we killed him 2-3 times until he ressed at spirit healer for his cowardly ways. Other than that i don't attack alliance or see many horde players attack them.  
---
But i also played on Shazzrah EU on Alliance side and had run into few lvl 60 warrior and hunters that camp and kill low lvl people. So it's bad either side, but right now on Firemaw i think its fine, no that many skirmishes or ganks happen.
---
So what? If it’s an upgrade, you can need. It’s extremely difficult to find weapon upgrades as Druid. I swapped out Smite’s mighty hammer from DM at lvl 48....
---
I’m a Warrior but even when its not my problem - thats when I put my foot down. This run was completely guildies and at the end I pretty much explained that without severe change I won’t be playing with them any time in the near future.
---
Cause I brought the Priest water (IRL buddy + new too the game) I mentioned that its not cool using the healers as an extended mana bar and we don’t buy water so you don’t have to eat. 
---
Its not much of an expectation wanting people to bring food + water to a dungeon, they fly through town on the way every time anyway.
---
Also likely bannable. Blizzard will probably label it blackmailing (which lets face it, it is :p) and issue warning/ban.
---
Good to know. I really like healing and running dungeons with my priest but not really questing. My intention was to level mostly through dungeons and what little questing needs to be done for each.
---
It's defaulted to 3 as that was the classic settings. It even notates it as "3 (Classic)"
---
This the correct answer. Set it to Kargath right before raid.
---
I can answer that.... For money.....
---
The fact that he found an alliance player means he was probably in the wrong zone.  Likely wandered into teldrassil by accident and was set upon by guards.  All 3 alliance players up there had no choice but to cower in shadow form until the threat had passed.
---
That camera flash ruined the shot, take it again
---
Agreed here. Vanilla tanking is pretty easy but also kinda boring. Basically any other expansion it feels much more fun to tank, less of a chore.
---
Back in the days of yore I played both alliance and horde very seriously (TBC I had a Dwarf Warrior and a Tauren Druid Gladiator). Horde was *so* much easier for PvP but I think a lot of it is because people roll horde when they are like young adults that are good at the game and competitive. A good chunk of Alliance are older people or kids who like Alliance because they want to play the traditional fantasy hero.
---
They say there's no bad guys but it's hard to believe that when the distribution of races is like it is. If both sides had some traditionally good and bad races I think it'd be a much easier sell.
---
I also think that's why Blood Elves were such a good idea for the horde so some of the kids that wanted an anime hero were now on the horde side.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
Dude, that’s awesome!
---
Thanks, this made my day =)
---
Yep, every other quest is “that murloc/gnoll/kobold/quilboar/etc. camp is fishing/mining/living in OUR lake/mine/meadow! Go exterminate them.” Like damn can’t we live in harmony? Guess we gotta go commit genocide for the umpteenth time
---
As a lock I often feel so bad when healers heal me mid fight cause i tap. 2 taps can take me near 50-60% of my health and I intend to drain my way back so I don't need it but obviously a healer cant constantly be having to verify whether im gonna drain or im genuinely getting my ass handed to me etc, too much chaos in some fights and they got enough on their plate.
---
Also SS / healthstones are something that any lock should aim to ensure is handed out. But after the first healthstone, we can't see if its used so we need the info to make a new one... Which I happily do cause who doesn't want to feel wanted?!
---
Depends what you mean by larger, i raid sized meat grinder battles? Yes, melee is pretty bad, however, this likely will only be the case during P2 PvP and only if you choose to go for the main group, theres always positions to attack from the flanks.
---
In pre 1.11 AV, it was the same thing, avoid the main fight and peel off to the sides, go for objectives etc. Think. Dont just blindly run into a stack of 20 players and hope for good results. In 1.12 AV, i doubt its even going to be an issue because so few people PvP in 1.12 AV
---
Otherwise, in the more common, smaller group fights, with a good amount of open terrain, theyre still very strong.
---
Guy wants an AR, guy gets an AR, grats 👍
---
The person you're replying to is correct but they are missing part of the equation that you have noticed. Reckoning works, but it isn't intuitive and is bad for reasons most people don't realize- it has nothing to do with generating stacks and is rather an issue of how stacks are consumed.
---
The answer to your dilemma is that if you're autoattacking your target, being crit causes an automatic and instant Reckoning attack on your target, resetting your swing timer in the process. So if you have a 3.6s weapon, and you're crit mid-way though your weapon swing, you will instantly counterattack and then your next autoattack will be 3.6s after that reckoning attack. You never build up charges unless you intentionally stop attacking. If you stand without attacking and get crit, and THEN swing, you will hit with multiple white attacks as you're expecting.
---
The only way to use Reckoning to its fullest potential is to disable autoattack and attack manually every time you want to swing.
---
Esfand gives a good explanation of how it works. [https://youtu.be/bJi4W2RquME?t=3706](https://youtu.be/bJi4W2RquME?t=3706)
---
Mate, it's like the wild west sometimes. They all run in different directions, spamming AoE, for that sweet, sweet dps...
---
God damn reddit clickbait
---
it wasn't dilluted, it had extra hops
---
I get it, I'm not arguing with anyone on this dingus' behalf.  I'm just offering a different point of view that leans to a little less entitlement and more of just getting shit done.  That guy will have to change or forever be blacklisted.
---
You'd think so, but I've been in plenty groups over the past week where being anywhere under what the leader considers "proper" DPS gets you a swift kick.
---
Alliance if its the minority. In case it isnt, i go and roll alliance on another server.
---
I rather go 1v3 instead of having a hard time to see/tag enemies before they die.
---
Dozens of us!
---
The reward is utter garbage for casters so....
---
Yes I've been bored outta my mind with other rpgs where it seems to be all about "rush to Max lvl" before you can do group content. Feels pointless. I usually lose my interest during the leveling process.
---
Because strafing is more useful, so now you can r click to turn instead which is way less frequent.
---
Alao, 'e' is the best keybind ever
---
They're all very different in playstyle. Try to pick a class you'll enjoy and you'll be fine
---
As a main healer for 95+% of my priest's PVE/instance experience, you'd be surprised how many of the warriors that have come through my party don't even carry a shield on them, or have a rehearsed bit about how they simply can't tank with their dps spec.
---
Lol I’m Okrawinfrey &lt;cajun style&gt;
---
Um no, try about 110 seconds drinking to buff the whole party. Not to mention drinking the entire dungeon run. This is wit BiS water btw. all for a mana buff that doesnt even cover the cost of 1 spell.
---
Very, very, very nearly 50
---
This is severely inaccurate, shadowfang is S tier for level 19 twink weapons. It's also the rarest 19 twink weapon.
---
The math checks out
---

---
Ugh wtf that sucks... I would feel the same way man. Hopefully you can get your account back...
---
Where is this?
---
Strafing on A and D should take not so long to get used to, I'd say that 10hours of actual combat will have you used to it. Maybe a bit less.
---
A nostromo or an external device to replace a keyboard I'd say about 2 weeks time, it does require some goodwill
---
Crit roll
---
Google
---
It's pretty dam close, but we get a leather helm as bis. I can't remember the name right now
---
Yeah once maybe twice. After that everybody just alt tabs or go do something else which has the opposite effect.
---
Melee or Hunter only. The only exception is Priest in  WotLK.
---
I maknly play warrior since 15 years (or 18 if you count other games). I would love to play Paladin if we had TBC/Pre 3.0.8 Ret in PvE.
---
Other stuff I always do:
---
* Take the ugliest face + hair combo
---
* Min/max as much as I can
---
* Everything that has value &gt; 10g being need (but only when announced in chat before start)
---
* Same leveling path
---
* Leave a group if someone is being toxic and doesnt want to shut up
---
🙄🤣
---
that's gonna be an unsub for me
---
Finally hit 40 with my Elemental Shaman and I feel like I am doing something wrong. People write everywhere that Ele is a caster first and foremost, but if I only cast to kill enemies, I am OOM after 2 mobs of my level. Most of the time I feel like I am playing Enh, frontloading some spells and then simply wailing with my melee weapons and windfury. 
---
Now if people here weren't that adamant that Ele is better, I would simply respec, but all of this makes me feel like there is something I don't get. Doesn't help that online guides seem to be completely focused on level 60 raiding, with tactics that don't really work when you're alone and have to kill dozens of mobs really quick. 
---
I also kind of feel like I am a bit underpowered. I constantly see other classes pull 3+ mobs of the same level, while for me 2 are enough to get me on low health and out of mana.
---
My bad I think I was drunk but it’s field repair not that’s at him

---
Everyone in the guild benefits from you putting in an effort and should be rewarded thereafter as well, I also have the outrageous opinion that if you're better than your colleague at work you should be compensated more.
---
What UI is that, Esfand?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Is why
---
All of this! Playing pservers was my group's main reason for rolling on a PvE server for Classic. I enjoy WPvP as much as the next gal, but I learned from pservers that I have about zero tolerance for this behavior. 
---
(Last pserver, my friends stopped playing because we literally couldn't progress through HF Pen. Fully geared 70s camped Thrallmar, including a rogue that ganked every 58 outside the gate. For three days. I finally got past him with some higher level helpers, only to find a literal line of 70s stretched across the (only) road into Zang. /ragequit)
---
Really?  How do you un-disenchant?
---
but why NSFW??
---
Engineering is THE endgame profession, at least for PvP. Not sure if there's anything else. That said, with high level leathercrafting you can do some BiS items.
---
As long as you have to warlocks it really doesn't take long to douse everything
---
Youre so wrong. Good riddance if a tank leaves over a 2h drop... they going to leave for some other selfish reason
---
Unless you have 2h fury warriors on the raid, Ashkandi and Zinkroh are hunter dps increase, and rets if you got any without Nightfall for some reason.
---
Have you ever been in an organized guild before...?
---
Congrats !
---
Did you manage to do it in one go or did you try several times ?
---
Yes, people expect healing paladins. Though i specced prot and grinded dungeons all the way to 60 and did just fine
---
Nearly all warriors got the leather shoulders but our rogues still suffering.
---
at 1:09 you get unflagged for pvp just as that paladin comes in to kill you. super lucky XD
---
I’ve logged 100 hours since launch and I’m lv 32

---
What party/raid frames are those?
---
I just farm my way to tokens. Free accounts besides the purchase of expansions...
---
Rogues can do that on private servers and old vanilla, sure. But the leeway is absolutely huge now and often stops a rogue from being able to deadzone kite restealth. Perplexity etc. have shown this. Without that, rogues will get absolutely shit on by warriors 1v1
---
39 on my rogue and 25 on my mage, switched focus back to rogue for P2 announcement
---
How dare youuuuuu! I thought tbc had an excellent mix of quests/grindable stuff/and dungeons. Lots of loot to chase and maybe the best raid ever to dive into upon completing your journey to 70.
---
Don't the teddy bears that live in the cave next to moonglade have an item at exalted that lets you become one?  Or did that come after classic?
---
Edit: Nevermind, I guess I'm thinking of something else.  Looked up the rewards and the best you get is to summon a furlbolg with a trinket.
---
Do servers have to spend time carrying out chicken before they can carry steak, similar to rogue skill up?
---
Percentage of value makes more sense for lockboxes than it does for servers.
---
Its the old wildhammer to ironforge route. The Ironforge pale ale was named for its ability to stay fresh on the gryphon from hinterlands to ironforge. 
---
Legends talk of another such drink. The shadowforge stout. Able to take the heat of the trip through searing gorge from BRD to Ironforge. But ragnaros is more of a whiskey god.
---
I heard some guilds changed to lc since no one wanted to waste dkp. They would have had to destroy the loot otherwise.
---
But LC is better imo. Is also logical that the core of the guildraid gears first.
---
I doubt it
---
I did my first MC in a pug today, healing as a 59 ele shaman.
---
Was 3rd top heals.
---
I am pretty fkn close to bis heal list though.

---
Edit: typos &amp; was Mele buff GRP so mana tide totem is mostly wasted.

You usually pair a dagger with an offhand, right? So that will depend on the offhand.

what about now?
---
In no universe are the alliance the “bad guys”, some of Blizzard’s own developers have often said that the horde were the baddies.
---
“We found in testing that our focus groups played alliance characters, most players wanted to try “the good guys.”
---
Yes, those all count.
---
This is why I don't understand the chat profanity filter.
---
I just committed yet another atrocity for the undead.... for 3 silver.  But I can't say "shit" in chat.
---
Thats wrong. It works in classic (different reason tho) just needs a bit of timing  because of spell batching.
---
Hit 31 this weekend, and had some guildies help me get the Whirlwind axe. Still really enjoying it.
---
I knew it did in later expansions, but so far I’ve only noticed it with blizzard
---
What's the deal with tards like you and award speech edits when you get downvoted?

Gambling in a sense that same piece of gear can drop different items when disenchanted.
---
Playing sub optimally makes you good?
---
Yeah that cloth helm of agility won’t auction for a ton so de it.
---
I know.. I know.. give them love. I did everything with questing
---
Making friends in game will help you progress and understand the mechanics a lot better, thus increasing your self confidence.  Im sure it won't be easy for you at first, but if you don't give in to that anxious voice inside your head you'll learn to really enjoy yourself. There isn't much that is  better than having a laugh and a joke with people you care about in a game. 😁 You can do it!
---
The thing is most bis lists are for pve raid dps, for example warriors wearing leather and nail etc. For pvp it’s a whole different game where you can stack resistances, and warriors always want to be in plate, hunters in mail etc. So take bis lists with a grain of salt, usually tier sets are super balanced in the sense that they have a ton of every stat instead of stacking int, which is super good for pvp
---
Hey guys, I’m having trouble deciding between playing a priest or shaman. I’m mainly interested in duels, wPvP, and BGs. I’m happy to heal in raids and dungeons, but I’d play shadow and ele/resto pvp. Can anyone give me some differences between the two or their recommendations please?
---
My dream mh+oh nice

Use something like gathermate to know where the spawns are.
---
You can do partial runs: 
---
BRD Arena/Anger/Giolem. That cover your pre-bis Belt &amp; Boots in about 20 minutes per run.
---
LBRS Omokk/Shadowhunter/Voone runs will cover your pre-bis legs in about 20 minutes per run.
---
Jed/Rend runs for pre-bis trinkets and a decent ring if you don't want to get freezing band. As well as some decent FR gear at about 30-40 minutes per run.
---
These 3 are very popular farm runs and would be easy to find groups for.
---
A less common would be Magistrate/Unforgiven Strat runs. This would be for (alt) pre-bis head. 
---
Pre-bis chest is crafted whether you are a tailor or not. 
---
You are kind of SOL with Weapon and Wand since Scholo takes usually over an hour. You could get the Inventor's Focal Sword for Mara as a minor downgrade.
---
I mean high levels won’t be rewarded for ganking. And low levels won’t be camping really..
---
Yes. One GCD.
---
I spent two full days farming crusader back in the day. And after an hour of spamming I realised selling it was the most boring thing in the game and never did it again.

It works for some people but.. just a warning.

Well I see myself as filthily casual nowadays with a kid and all, just hit 51 this morning while the baby was sleeping. Meanwhile the guild has been raiding since week 2 or 3. 
---
I'm enjoying it a lot though, I'm finally playing the real game again, instead of some private server where I don't know if I get to keep my char. It's so great knowing that it's my "real" tauren druid, and it makes me want to do it all. I'm taking fishing and cooking for the first time, found some good leveling routes where I get to do what seems to be most quests, etc. 
---
And I know I'll still be able to get my MC loot way before BWL comes out due to being a druid :) so all good in the hood!
---
Inevitably loot council will cause drama and someone will feel butt hurt on a long enough timeline.  Of that you can be sure... it’s as imperfect as the human being making the decisions.  DKP is a free market, stuff costs money, do you have the money or not - and what’s it worth to you versus the player beside you?
---
There is certainly an element of being the misunderstood "bad" guys that appeals to the younger crowd. Its like thinking affliction tees and spikes are awesome when youre younger. Not an insult just that preferences seem to change with age
---
Lol this is how I did it too, I asked to join a group, they days they were full, I just let them clear and I grabbed my egg when they pulled the group circling the egg lol
---
Last I remember, gambling was permitted, you just couldn't advertise in any chat channels other than party and guild, due to constant casino spam in trade.
---
Stupid question - how do you change? Is it just in menus or do you have to /console command?
---
Yeah I looked at the photo and can see you’re not in the right spot. If you stand in the doorway or on the curved steps you get rested. Worked for me.
---

---
Yeah you’re kind of an idiot
---
Mograine is pretty cool, according to last census it had 50/50 alliance and horde ratio
---
Got stuck on heartseeker as alliance, rerolled myself, dont regret my decision whatsoever
---
Not at all especially in a pvp game. Your comments are so cute tbh
---
Fair enough, can't argue with that.
---
I'd imagine there's a lot of guilds that use DKP.
---
I think the skill level of people is high enough where MC is pugged, so you get the rise of Officer loot/Rolling.
---
Yes because your toon would be dead / engaged in wpvp so you would no longer be rested.
---
Edit: wrong your whoops.
---
Horde winning more has nothing to do with overall population numbers. They win more because after 15 years everyone knows that Horde is "The PVP Faction". So if you're at all interested in pvp  you roll Horde. 
---
As for what can be done, nothing can be done. I'm not advocating for a solution. I just think it's stupid when Horde players talk tough shit about how good they are when beating down the underdog.
---
so do i delete my friends from battle.net if they decide to roll alliance?
---
Generally you don't even need to speak really. If you're questing just say "inv" for a quest or invite someone else and it can either be a one and done or you can decide to do other quests in the same zone together.
---
For dungeons no one besides people in "spellcleave" groups are going to care if you're new. Especially if you say "i'm new anything I need to know?"
---
No, these are the rules from right after trade chat got invaded with casino spam, some time after AQ just before TBC
---
It definitely depends on which type of item it is. For some the demand can be so good that you don't even need to have a price that puts you in the lowest 200 of that item and it still sells within an 8 hour window, and for others your 24 hour auction will never sell if you get undercut twice.
---
Specific things that I sell for those cases:
---
Star Belt is a lvl 35 tailoring crafted belt with 4 spirit and 13 dmg/healing. It costs about 1g30s to craft and I sell it for 2g25s. I've so far sold 52, but it doesn't really matter if I put 10 on AH or 2, because I normally sell 1-2 during peak hours and I'm literally the only one crafting them. There I am lucky with supply, being alone, but the demand isn't so high that I could be undercut twice and still sell.
---
Wildvine I buy below 90s-1g each, and I put on AH for either 1g20s each or 1g30s each. Doesn't matter if there are 50 Wildvine below 1g currently, I still put mine up, and they often sell for that price, partially because I put in exact stacks people need (4 and 6).
---
So for some high vendor value items I'd hesitate on making an 8 hour auction, I'd rather make 2-3 2 hour auctions each evening. And for some low/no vendor value items (enchanting mats), I don't care, I'll put them up 200 for twice the current lowest price as a 24 hour auction, if it doesn't sell I lose nothing.
---
Playing for the first time in a decade, rolled a gnome warlock this go-around.  Had a 60 Holy Pally in Vanilla, 70 Gnome Mage and 70 Blood Elf Priest in BC.
---
I’m so glad they re-released OG WoW - 40 man BWL was my favorite.  Can’t wait to get Onyxia and MC attuned...
---
Gehennas. 
---
I only do guild groups because as a DPS I cannot find a single group that is not reserving orbs and greens.
---
I feel like I’ve been playing a decent amount. I only play in the evenings and average 2-3 hours a day max. I’m level 50. It’s been pretty damn fun.
---
Thats tooltip
---
Yeah I can't find the website again, I am probably incorrect about this. Disregard that.  
---
If I manage to find it, I will EDIT this post.
---
Messaging people you have on your ignore list is a mutable offense, report them.
---
WHO is that?
---
Once you hit 38 and have WW Axe you’ll typically always pull aggro on the X if you’re SS &gt; WW. It’s not a big deal. You’re still wearing plate. It’s pretty rough before then.
---
Sweet thanks!
---
Thankfully this guild is Horde, seeing paladins wield this is the worst!
---
Heroic strike is the most rage expensive way to do damage.
---
Yeah I agree with you there. It's what everyone acknowledges though - Horde PvPs while Alliance avoid it most of the time at least until they have the numbers or it's obvious they are going to win.
---
Horde definitely ganks more but I'm leveling toons on both factions and I've still only ever been camped by Alliance.
---
If he's a Beastmaster Hunter with a tanky pet that's perfectly possible even past 40.   
---
The typical strategy for pulling 3-4 at the same time is to Arcane/Aimed, multishot, then go all out on the main target until the 2-3 adds reach you. At which point you FD. By this time the first mob is dead and you've started on a second.   
---
Frost Trap is an obvious choice for this, if you can plan in advance.  
---
Essentially the pet only really has to tank two mobs at a time tops.    
---
If I have a Frost Trap down I'll also use a few GCDs on applying Serpent Sting on all adds, as the strings will be tickling for their full duration.   
---
Another point to be made is this allows for optimal multishot usage as well. 
---
As for damage, perfectly decent bows are available for cheap on the auction house. Though yes it does suck we don't have any BoP blues until Maraudon. 
---
The situation he's talking about does drain mana, but his point was only how such situations can easily be handled by a hunter (compared to the shaman), not that it was "optimal".
---
How to get rid of it?
---
We're going to start using DKP just because it makes it easier to track who has gotten gear.
---
Loot council is good but I would not be surprised if many guilds currently using it switched to a more formal system.
---
I am a tank, and I agreed with them being overpowered, but I don't think they are ruining anything
---
I had trouble with people at dungeons but I don't remember if they were mages, sometimes they are essentials and I wish to have a mage for poly and AOE
---
For pvp they are warrior killers, a gnome 15 leves under mine never missed a poly or the frost thing that make me unable to move, i don't know but seems that warriors can't trade with mages 
---
There are good mages and bad mages, like any other class. You are probably overreacting.
---
Warriors may not be overpower, but they are the real tank class, and everyone is needing one, mages are desirable but at same time disposable and I am fine with that.
---
Classic has strange design. In the leveling dungeons you dont even need a tank, like a priest power word shield on whatever dps pulls heals the whole pull. One thing that does bother me are tanks that want everyone at 100% nana every pull. i can still cast the 2 spells to heal this pull with 90% mana warrior man.
---
It's 'cute' that you think I'm talking about PvP.
---
That's a tiny minority of shitty groups no one joins to begin with. The vast majority of 'x reserved' groups are usually stuff that makes sense.
---
Now the real question, an answer to the forbidden secret. Is, did you Shift Uppercase all the A’s or did you Caps Lock it?
---
Do you play a mage?
---
I'd say 2 mobs is single target, 3 mobs + is aoe for best dps. Would need confirms
---
Do some dungeons and put yourself out there to talk to your group! Me and two friends made a guild and we've recruited almost exclusively through talking to people who are guildless in our dungeon runs and figuring out they're nice people who we'd want in guild.
---
Amazing.
---
Or how to move it?
---

---
I don’t think it ever really is. I just specced shadow and healed my way to 60 in dungeons
---
yeah you aren't power hungry, you are just doing what "91%" of people want.
---
that's why the posts were more upvoted than downvoted.  that's exactly why.  lmao
---
I know there are tooltip addons, I"m not sure which ones work with classic.
---
I use ELVUI which handles it's tooltip stuff if needed. But I have a UI I'm making for myself that uses tiptac. There's even a fix to make tiptac work for Classic. Just look and see what you like out there.
---
They all do. Any slow is a 'chill'
---
Then whys he clicking his robes on use ability? He wouldn't have DE'd if that was the case.
---
Enhance shamans are actually garbage tier for everything. You need to remove that Unbreakable video from your brain, let go of your sulfuras dreams, respec to resto for raiding, and respec to elemental for PvP.
---
Obviously there is only 1 head but each is taking a part. One gets the jaw, one gets the scalp, one gets the brain, one gets the eyes, and one gets the skull. Only logical explanation!

Why do people think that a single person would have an effect on a 10-15k player difference? If you are alliance on a PvP server with more than 58% horde, you are just honor points to them.
---
Most of the time they're just looking to avoid confrontation and are just as afraid of you as you are of them.
---
Doing that will just startle them and cause them to attack out of fear.
---
Qol macros are the stance dance ones. I'm on my phone so I can't cop them. But for example one that casts overpower when in battle stance, and in other stances it swaps to battle stance first. Same for taunt in battle stance etc

I saw the rick roll bot reply but I still clicked. Rick roll meme is rare these days

Do a dungeon at lv 60, you see 3 a dung.
---
So disingenuous. How about try granting him that? Can you still maintain your argument? Trash.
---
I knew I couldn’t be the only one thinking it
---
Right proper louditude
---
It’s true. Any horde saying it’s not like that are just bad at the game.

Its not like people dont pvp while leveling, and they might not camp you but they will for sure go even more out of their way to kill you.

Guild/Friends: Free Snacks / Free Portals anytime
---
Dungeon Groups: Free Snacks / Free Portal at end of dungeon (even 2 different if asked nicely) to any city
---
City/Open world: Portal 1g / Snacks for tips. If you insult me by tipping 20s for 4 stacks water and 4 stacks bread (lvl45), transaction gets cancelled and I move on
---
To buy no. For discount, yes.
---
My guild killed rag with our MT wearing mostly leather gear for high fr resist. But yeah he was crushable
---
I leveled combatdagger and I am combat dagger at level 60. I gouge the mobs at 80-100 energy and walk behind and backstab. Do the dungeons that drop daggers, I got lucky a few times on dagger drops. Oh and be sure not to roll need against a caster on a caster dagger!
---
Your intelligence is a joke.
---
The ui I use is elv ui btw
---
Both classes are very different. Priest is a caster with fairly good CC and Shamans are melee / casters, with that being said, You'd have to get use to your totems can be a little tricky at first but I'm sure you'd have no problem getting the hang of it. Both are very good late game classes so its all up to you, Just be careful with priest I know a lot of people who were priests but ended up respecing because they couldn't find groups at all for dps and didn't wanna heal all the way to 60 anymore. You're call hope this helps somewhat.
---
We do
---
I didnt say it takes 3sec. I said that I ALWAYS spend at least 5 minutes waiting on something before a dungeon, and instead of playing on my phone, I could conjure water, if I were a mage.
---
Left Skeram, glad I did, I checked SW and IF before I made my choice and thought there would have needed to be 4-5 layers for there to be the same number of alliance as on Heartseeker. I knew it was risky to transfer because of how high a pop I assumed Skeram was. Turns out there were only 2 layers, dodged a bullet getting off there.
---
My wife frequently forgets to loot quest items so I’ll say a nice reminder like “Hey, don’t forget to decapitate that guy” and “Here cut this dudes heart out”
---
"Every single parent gamer" like my calm, introverted dad who has played nothing but Horde since beta? Sure.
---
If you aren't having mana issues I don't see why not. Just be careful of the deadzone and you should be good.
---
I doubt aoe is better dps on only 3 mobs than frostbolting them down is.
---
With that being said i never played a mage in my life and very happy not to do so right now with the current 50 mages for every other class meta.
---
Learn to PrintScreen!
---
Yeah. I can’t disagree with you there.

Some people don't enjoy the things we enjoy, doesn't mean they are hurt or damaged.

Which would be attack power
---
What happens when you grant him the point he’s trying to make? The only evidence you can come back with would be anecdotal as well.
---
Yes please
---
Can you copy pasta that macro please?
---
&gt; like a priest power word shield on whatever dps pulls heals the whole pull
---
That would only work if your party is overleveled or if you're only running low level instances. Even if you don't have a tank, PWS is one of the worst things you can do due to how mana inefficient it is and how easily you will OOM without damage mitigation and having to heal clothies.
---
I really hope you don't do this on your priest. Save your shield for emergency situations and even then, it's sometimes better to let DPS die so you'll have the mana to keep your tank up and prevent a wipe.
---
That is called insider trading, have to report you to the authorities.
---
Unless something yellow and shiny would distract me, of course.
---
Last I saw Blaumeux is the closest server to 50/50. Really glad my friends picked it, I love the balance right now.
---
Seriously, there's a whiny alliance thread about something basically every week - even more often on the retail subreddit.
---
Victim Complex - the shared racial of the alliance.
---
Try two at once. I’ve been having my pet tank one as close as possible while still being able to shoot it, while I tank the other. Alternate shooting one and meleeing the other. If they are close enough together they will both get hit by multishot.
---
Except that my server is heavy alliance, so your 1:10 is a lie.  I don't know who said pvp servers are almost exclusively horde, they were 100% misinformed.
---
Thank you for the explanation, so it's just bad :/
---
How does need before greed work exactly?
---
I totally get this. Limited people want that drop and so on.
---
But the people running this purely invariably beg for five mages and don't give a shit what's in it for them, or that they'll compete so heavily on anything they can use.
---
Imagine being gangbanged by horde in every single level 30+ zone. Wanting to play the game without being camped 3 to 1 is being scared?
---
If your GM is a streamer, Get out. Nothing good comes from this. Pay him real money in donos and maybe youll get purples.
---
Because spontaneity is fun. If you think that it's nothing but a gankfest you're sorely mistaken.
---
Tanked WC on my warrior alt last night and it seemed like the only skill this one mage trained was arcane explosion. Eventually I stopped caring if he pulled aggro and decided to let him learn for himself.
---
I thought it was in WOTLK? I'm pretty sure I remember constant yelling in org advertising their casino, until they made that rule.
---
Taunt is pretty simple once you know how threat works. 
---
You have 100 threat, rogue has 60 threat. Rogue moves to 101 threat, but the mob does not look at them. They have to go to 110% or 110  to pull the mob off you(ranged have to go to 130%). 
---
What threat does is give you the maximum amount of threat present on the target AND debuff the mob to attack you.  So if threat looks like...
---
You:100, 
---
Rogue:500, 
---
Mage: 530, 
---
WArlock:510, 
---
healer:80
---
If you taunt you will go to 530 threat and the mob will be forced to attack you. If NO ONE does anything after you've taunted the mob it will stay on you indefinitely as long as no more threat is generated on it. If anyone breaks the 110%/130% threshold again though, that mob is coming for their booty once the forced fixate debuff wears off.
---
So if a rogue has an unhealthy hankering for opening with an ambush that does 1500 damage, that's essentially 1500 threat to you immediately on that mob as soon as you taunt it. This can actaull ybe slightly amusing to do  as the more threat on a mob when you taunt it, the harder it will be for someone to do that last 10% or 30% depending on if they're melee ranged. Certainly a healer will never take it off you. It can give you a slightly mild headstart. Also on topic is the fact they've already blown their big whammy opener, their dps usually will go down a bit and you might even find it easier to keep the mob.
---

---
One by one is probably more efficient. Remember that you can drink while your pet tags the next mob! Only places I did multi tags as a hunter was when I was questing for mob tags agains other players.
---
Do you want a couple counter-examples for this statement?
---
yep, attackpower that is lower on this weapon than on lvl 30-40 greens you can get from quests or for 1-2 gold from auction house, correct.
---
is your pet bar disabled?
---
Didn’t really think anxiety rolled over in to online games as you can be and pretend who you want to be your online persona the superman to your Clarke Kent, just try push your boundaries it’s what’s life’s about your only here once
---
Gratz friend! 
---
What’s the UI addon called?
---
Lots of hybrid classes get ignored in bwl though. Druid tanks for example.
---
Ok, so you do make a few good points. Bears do get more health and armor, and that does help mitigate the crushing and critical blows.
---
But while it is very difficult for even plate tanks to become crit immune through use of defense rating, it is trivial for warriors to become crit immune.
---
Shield Block increases the chance for warriors to block by 75%. This pushes both crushing blows and critical strikes off the table, thus making a warrior immune to both. This is only relevant on a boss, as with multiple mobs the charges will be used up, but trash doesn't hit hard enough to worry about.
---
So yes, crits and crushing blows are still very much part of the equation. In BC, Paladins had to try very hard to get crush immune, and after they did they were nearly as good as warriors to MT. For druids, Blizzard buffed their armor and health even more than it is in classic, and healers had their longevity buffed, and so a druid tank was also very viable. But here in classic, healers mana is not infinite, and druids mitigation advantage is not as large.
---
No not all. I only know of the one for the fire res buff
---
Then that's their mistake?  Not sure what your point is
---
Left the kid to raise himself, and he made it to the NFL. Found out Malone was his dad later in life and now the two are close. Personally I wouldn’t care to build a relationship with my absentee dad who totally could have supported me but chose not to, in addition to being a child rapist, but hey.
---
That child’s name? Albert Einstein. (Actually Demetress Bell)
---
I was in health class in middle school and I had s fairly young male teacher, definitely in his 20s. Reading from a sheet about mouth and digestive anatomy I accidentally said “Vulva” instead of “uvula” and I’ve never seen a grown man blush so hard
---
Many people go on pve servers to avoid the douchebaggery and imbalance of wpvp while questing. There will be a ton of them who still join BGs.
---
Yep and I'm someone who played Horde on Frostmourne in retail. It was, no exaggeration, about 90% Alliance.
---
It seems like warlocks are generally more squishy than mages until BWL and I don't really like the idea of that. If I had to choose between the two, I think I prefer the mage class fantasy anyway.
---
Thanks for the responses.
---
berserker stance&gt;intercept, berserker stance&gt;berserker rage, battle stance&gt;mocking blow if a taunt fails, battle stance&gt;hamstring...you lose a lot of your kit if you choose not to stance dance.  a lot of these tools are really helpful for dealing with situations that arise in incompetent pugs.
---
Doubt you'll see him on the battlefield unless you venture into Org AH :D
---
DNB is the alliance side equivalent, I believe.
---
What is the difference in the rogue going to auction house and buying a level 30-40 green ?
---
Ok sure let's assume what he says is true. How many more people buy tokens compare to gold from gold farmers?
---
You're hilarious. Ammo is cheap as fuck, Thistle Tea is a 5 min CD that costs 40s
---
Damn, a 2% drop rate item collected twice in 7 runs.
---
That is insane.
---
Talking about tusks...being a 30-ish Alliance Warrior in a 70-30 Horde-Alliance PVP server hunting tusks for my Whirlwind axe in StVietnam...
---
FUCK trolls. Fuck the Horde. Fuck RNG. Fuck being a levelling Prot Warrior in Classic. Fuck Azeroth, fuck the Titans, fuck the Universe. Fuck me.
---
I have culled, killed and maimed a hundred Bloodscalp buggers and I have 14 tusks to my name. I have been ganked twice for every tusk I got.
---
If I could transfer my Rage IRL to my Warrior, I could unbind Bloodrage.
---
Goddamn.
---
Derp derp not crot capped can't tank any bosses.  Listen that's so wrong that it isn't even worth having the argument about anymore. It's been had to death
---
Same. And you'd think after they're done bitching that they would you know, switch to the "easier" faction, but then they wouldn't have anything to cry about on reddit I guess. 
---
Some of these comments literally read like satire.
---
I think my brain stopped working for a moment ha ha
---
Healers always do this even if I tell them not to worry about it. I utilize food a lot and when I tap then sit down to eat and my healer gives me a full bar heal it wastes my food 🤨
---
Why would I grant that then? If both our sides are anecodtal then what gives him the point if his is anecdotal?
---
Pretty sure those aren’t just any dwarf homes in the side of the mountain, those would be part of Grim Batol, a major location in the lore for the Second War and its aftermath
---
some are already ghosttowns. Dragonfang Horde here.
---
This.
---
People that quote APES doing something in this game probably aren't even 60 yet. Go try Rag right now with a random pug of people not even 60. It's not a free auto win. 
---
Those players are the Method of retail right now. You aren't them lol.
---
The only luck so far was while trying to kill raptors and avoid some pvp I went and killed basilisks to get places.  I know have three eyeball trinkets. 
---
Not worth a ton sadly.
---
Yes they do,  but how does that help the average player or anyone who isn’t in those guilds. They don’t take average joes and they don’t accept group invites in questing areas. I have sent an invite to multiple members of Grizzly for elite quest boss kills and regular kill quests and they decline every time. 
---
With that said, please explain to me how I get to kill a world boss as alliance in Stalleg.
---
I'm about to hit that milestone myself pretty soon and I'm doing so well in the 34-38 range with next to zero downtime that my biggest worry is Shadowform@40 being too mana-intensive and messing with my flow (especially because my wand will be much weaker for a bit)
---
I wish interfaction PvP was allowed hordeside (seeing how they're uncivilized clans people governed by the rule of the strong), but not for Alliance. That would amuse me.
---
Because Thistle Tea is overpriced as fuck
---
Its fine without gathering. Im engi/tailor and my plan is to get everything in gnome engi and the robes from tailoring then i can throw both away and pick mining and engi again for the goblins. Mage is bit self sufficient on this tho

Thanks! :) And is it that just a huge bag or what?
---
In still can't decide on anything. Class, race, server, nothing.
---
Sigh.
---
Might as well roll dice at this point.
---
They get no gear in tier 2, so that's kind of a problem.
---
god i just wanna pinch ur cheeks

Yeah but that means I would be admitting to watching the dub!

I believe OneBag does as well

Same! Long time WoW player but never played mage although I always played sorc in d2

Lineage II just had a teleport NPC in every town. Starting location teleport was even free IIRC.
---
But paying for riding a mount for 5 minutes from A to B was unique to WoW, yes.
---
They have pummel at that point.
---
Bag, shoulder enchants, free key to Naxxramas.
---
Adding to what's already been said, there's faldir's cove in the southwest of arathi. It's a cute little area where a bunch of pirates stranded near a reef full of naga. It's not great for your exp per hour, quite far away from the flight point, it puts you against elite mobs (relatively easy ones) and you need underwater breathing, so in terms of game design it's very iffy. The flavor is great though and I enjoyed my time there. As a warlock I probably had less issues with the area than other classes due to underwater breathing and being able to solo elites. 
---
If you want that pure exp/hr you probably want to grind sm cath, badlands, stv or desolace
---
Based on your synopsis I'd say roll priest.  Shaman can be fun  in Bg's and Wpvp, and duels - but priest is stronger for sure.  I've never been much into duels, but I've read here recently that shadow priest is the king of dueling.
---
Are you not reading? I told you, the rogue scales from weapon damage. Meaning the lvl 30-40 greens for him is way weaker than it would be on the druid since druids ignore weapon damage and only benefit from the stat.
---
But then he will use up all the time he has left on Earth!!!
---
Teleport was a thing in Lineage II as well. End teleport scrolls instead of hearthstone.
---
In my opinion, the interface should be as useful as possible and not contain superfluous information.
---
So you make your healer drink for an extra 30 seconds each drink because youre lazy? Youre probably taking more time waiting for the double drink than just not being a lazy ass. Imagine thinking people are entitled asking you to use your group utility spells in a group.
---
Taunt. Grab Aggie take hits and do damage
---
Imagine trying this hard to be condescending lol
---
While there's bound to be impatient or rude people in the game, remember that if you're playing, then there's also bound to be more new players figuring things out and looking for a more relaxed social playstyle.
---
As a fellow anxious person, it's important that you don't need to get along with everyone, but keep a look out for like-minded people.
---
Good luck out there :)
---
Check out esfands stream where he has the best of the best, and still is like bottom half of the dps.
---
He could instead be say, a warrior, and likely be #1 by a mile.
---
Now think of the avg blue geared ret paladin, not using full consumables.
---
In sulfuras level 60 hordes form parties and raids to gank on Redridge Mountains and Duskwood
---
Wait so spec feral but then try to tank / heal for pick up groups? Or just spec feral and avoid lfg?
---
Yes and that reason is to support EU connections, not to change their censoring policy to fit every subculture that the game is offered to. It's an MMO yes but still American developed. Blizzard does not want people using the N word in their product.
---
Wat? Why would you want mh without oh?
---
I know my class better than priest but here's what I understand of it:
---
Shadow Pros: 
---
Devastating in pvp due to good damage, good pvp CC, heals, dots. They're a bit of a rare unicorn pvp wise, but every class respects or fears them. 
---
Shadow Cons:
---
Hard to gear due to needing cloth caster gear and being in competition with many top tier PvE specs. Either difficult to get raid spots (1 sp per raid ideally) or requiring weekly respec. Not terribly competitive as a PvE dps, not capable of endgame 5man healing without respec either.
---
Ele/resto Pros:
---
Devastating in pvp due to insane burst damage, burst heals, utility CC cleanse. Gearing is easy due to being able to wear mail caster gear which has no other users on horde. Grab the pieces while healing dungeons/raids. No respec needed, highly demanded raid healer, welcomed in 5v5 content due to utility. PvE damage wise with downranking LB/clearcasting they can be competitive in the relatively short 5 man fights, but their sustain just isn't enough to handle anything other than perfectly optimal raid boss fights.
---
Ele/resto Cons:
---
PvP wise, shamans lack defenses relative to the offensive engage of most melee classes. When targeted in group fights, they rely on their team to protect them. The best they can do is tank up in mail gear so they can take a bit of a drubbing before going down. They are useless in 1vX situations, and need to be the aggressor against melee classes if they want to win. Despite being a highly demanded healer due to utility, they are also the weakest in terms of PvE performance outside their utility.
---
I do not agree. Mats are well known at this point and if you are going for world/server firsts you are gonna have that on lock before you start raiding.  This is a 15 year old game with private servers, so it has been min-maxed to death.
---
Vanilla was a different time where no one knew what the eye of sulfaras was when it dropped or how to make the hammer and MC was “harder”.
---
25 times??? 25?? I cleared it at most 4 times in a row with my buddies and we were over it. 25 is just batshit crazy
---
Aka worse than regular gloves with AP. It's a complete waste of several hundred gold for an orc.
---
Sure. I'm not saying I wouldn't have tagged along when I was 13 but I'm not 13 anymore. I'd be willing to bet that the faction balance of ages 30+ are pretty 50/50 but 10-15 has to be horde biased.
---
It's ElvUI , but be prepared to invest 30min into it to disable stuff and adjust stuff or even make it default.
---
Because you will start with a complete new UI on everything
---
Nice get!!
---
On benediction I think I’ve seen one person with an epic mount(I’m sure there are loads more but I’ve only seen one). I’ve only seen a handful of 60’s. To my knowledge there haven’t been any massive city pvp raids because people just aren’t there yet. The AH economy is still growing, there isn’t an abundance of endgame items up yet. It feels like most people on the server are moving casually toward 60 and endgame (most people from what I can tell, I’m certainly not speaking for everyone), as opposed to some severs where people’s schedules allow for them to play many hours a day/week and have resulted in multiple guilds downing rag and ony. 
---
My guess is that many of the people on Benediction were in the situation I was in. I was originally on Herod and within the first two days of release I just wanted to play, and having only an hour or so at night to play I wasn’t going to waste any time waiting in a queue, so I choose to move to benediction as i think a lot of people did. Knowledgeable people about the game, just not so hardcore that they felt it necessary to stay on Herod (or wherever they came from) as if it were the one true server.
---
Went farming myself lol
---
That doesn't seem very efficient with the AH cut. Why not just trade?
---
I usually pull one at a time and when one mob is about to die, I send the pet to the next mob.  If an additional mob agros I'll multishot and get one to chew on me while I damage my pets mob.  Once my pets target is almost dead I feign death so the mob goes to the pet.
---
Any good ways to kite/deal with a druid as a hunter? Best case scenario is that I feign death into freezing trap and somehow manage to evade them after, but I can’t see any way I would be able to beat them in a fair fight.
---
No making water soldier! If you arent casting blizzard with the other 7 mages youre outta the group.

That's not my point. My point is why is he pitting strafe on a and d when he can use right click with normal a and d to strafe already.
---
It's statistically improbable.

Playing since launch and I’m only 33 lol

Garrote do not silence in classic unfortunately

Blow me X.
---
Best server in the west coast yo
---
This hurts me as I am lvl 34 and barely 53g worth, so I know I won't ride when I ding 40...but specially because your toon is the spitting image of mine, 100% the same, so I just pictured my character on horseback.
---
Aww...
---
Would rather play the underpopulated faction but forced to play horde because of the undead racial. 
---
Played ally lock on pricate servers and i quit because dealing with an entire race having a free trinket and 5 sec immunity to fear is honestly not fun.
---
Playing horde so i dont have to fight undead specifically lol.
---
Seems like a standup fellow. If what he says is true, I believe you should temporarily promote him, see how he handles his new duties, and then officially promote him based on his performance. This "trial period" should last no longer than 2 weeks.
---
If you stay in barrens for 30 levels it's your own fault, there are options (although the fact that horde has the ability to make it to the mid 20s easily without stepping into contested territory is it's own thing... Alliance is lucky to be 12-14 before at least traveling through contested areas).  Ashenvale is shared, as is Hillsbrad, and Stonetalon is basically horde but has a very cool and interesting vibe imo.  Actually I admit I like the alliance zones more overall, certain horde areas are among my favorite such as 1k needles, thunder bluff and Silverpine.
---
Wearing it, so yeah
---
You misspelled heroes
---
You gotta pack water just in case you run across a mage like this. It sucks and they can be rude about it, but the best players come prepared for randos to fail them.
---
I still ask for water even if I have some already to preserve resources, but if they decline, it ain't worth being dramatic about. We got a task at hand.
---
Not really, what you're saying is someone lost a roll. They then posted a video about losing a roll to a class that could use the item, and by saying the druid could have gone to the auction house to buy a level 30-40 you are assuming the rogue can't go buy the item. There isn't a difference. It very well might have been an upgrade for the druid regardless of if he could go buy one he didn't. He rolled need and won, the only people crying about this travesty are OP and you with your skewed logic.
---
So at 60 I shouldn't bother doing quests?
---
I've found the RPPvP servers to be just as filled with trolls and morons as any other server honestly. Grobbulus' world chat is more toxic than Skeram where I originally came from.
---
Just got figure out what the tipping point is. Does personal experience qualify as good enough evidence to you? Neither one of us will be able to provide empirical data. I would say that the average player is 5x more likely (and that’s being generous to your side of the argument, imo (our only evidence)) to buy a wow token then they would be from some shady website where they have to go trade some level 1 character and risk getting banned. In this hypothetical world, I would rather there be gold sellers, as the result would be much less gold transferred through third parties.
---
Actually though.
---
From what I've been told Mograine and Ashbringer are ok.
---
Lvl 40 orc warrior
---
So I always chickened out from tanking until now, I ran runs of SM as a tank, and i have some questions.
---
Usually how i start a pull is charge (or shoot with a bow) into demo shout into deff stance  then start sundering the mobs. But while im building rage, to roll out sunders on the mobs, some dps is already out threating me. I put as much sunders as i can on a mob that is not targeting me, but still it's focused on the dps. Usually here i pray for a revenge to proc, but if it didn't, im left fumbling on my keyboard overwhelmed on what i should do. 
---
What am i doing wrong, and what should i do when there are 2+ mobs not on me?
---
That's a very good point. At some point you start hitting so hard that the primary point behind white hits, rage generation, is no longer an issue. Almost all of your main hand hits are cleaves (heroic strike does too much threat) and you're rage is fed with offhand attacks, and so you almost don't have a crit cap.
---
This is why Blizzard has had to nerf warrior rage generation every expansion, because its very difficult to keep it linked to damage output and yet scale in a sane manner.
---
Anyone know how Zandalar Tribe is holding up? Is the RP and PvP any good? Lots of trolls, or relatively few?
---
Haha, that's so annoying.
---
On Bind on equip items of value, you should roll need unless previously agreed upon rules were stated. For bind on pickup if the item benefits a class/mainspec they get to roll need. Otherwise all in the party should greed roll.
---
I usually only care like 6 on me unless I know I'm about to run a dungeon. So much wasted bag space by using shard bag. At  near max level it makes sense since like 10 man groups/raids really tax how many shards you need though
---
Yea I wouldn't concern yourself with that lol
---
Dual wield at low levels is actually worse than 2handers, sure you have 2 faster weapons for a more steady stream of rage but your chance to miss increases significantly and the offhand weapon deals reduced damage (mitigated by dual wield spec talents), combine that with now needing 2 weapons during a levelling process that provides several easy access high damage 2handers.

Most Warriors whether Arms or Fury are using 2hander because it's the best option while levelling, generally. As 2h Fury you can put those 5 talent points you would have put into DW spec into other talents like Blood Craze, Piercing Howl, Improved Battle Shout etc.. Though really the better option is probably to level as Arms, tactical mastery is a godsend and you won't have it until 45-50 as Fury.
---
Orcs too stronk
---
Ah did not know.  Thanks for the info
---
Aye. It's why I try to limit my inner asshole nature, lol
---
There is lol
---
You will have trouble fearing a warrior in berserker stance.
---
Are you trying to say that you have anecdotal evidence that the same number of players that buy wow tokens would also be buying illegal gold? Please continue.
---
That's because all of the alliance from Herod moved because of the imbalanced. Lol. I'd move there but I'm waiting to see if they allow paid server transfers.
---
Yeah how is that even possible? I mean I understand mathematically it's possible, but any chance theres something fishy going on here? Remember the layering exploit?
---
Well he likely has a main
---
Promote him !
---
Lol no. The only times that "alliance just quest beside me" is when they're WAY lower leveled or weaker than me, and even they'll wait till I get low or while I'm fighting a mob to try and gank me. Usually it's just them trying to flex level advantage or numbers advantage and then sitting down and trying to camp. 
---
Haven't seen so many no lifer gank squads ganking lowbies in Hillsbrad and camping out Hemet Nesingwary in STV probably ever. It's actually kinda pathetic
---
I assume you're just some weird troll...
---
And keep this disabled when you play rofl it's hard to look at
---
The people defending rolling on a shit druid weapon is kind of laughable. There are dozens of better weapons available beforehand. Know your class
---
Or maybe more horde do because... there's more of them?
---
Someone check the check on that maths
---
Everyone is so triggered
---
They def haven't
---
Come to Kurinnaxx my friend!
---
I saw this is Darkshore and actually stopped to admire it. I wondered to myself what lore it connected to with a huge titan sized sword in the ground, impeding the growth of the forest? Or stopping the spread of an evil growth?
---
Thanks for sharing this
---
Don't forget about the +30 sp enchant that you can't put on the staff.
---
This is actually a myth about IPAs. They were popular in India just because that was their preference of beer when brought a number of different styles.
---
Mineral stones!
---
You too man! And are you horde or ally? :D
---
I commented on a comment, not the original post.  So what's your point?
---
Mate, 53g at 34 is very good. I had less at 34 and came 8g short at 40. You'll be fine. Just keep punching every penny.
---
3/10 game is literally unplayable
---
I am a simple man, I see this meme and I upvote. Well done.
---
Lolwut.
---
That's a different scenario. When noone has rings yet then any ring is an upgrade. I would expect nearly the whole group to roll on it since every class can use one of the stats or both
---
The same thing happens in the early 20s with shoulder pieces and in the late 20s with head pieces
---
Does your social anxiety not trigger when posting on a sub where potentially 400k people would see this?
---
Also more potential honor points for you to farm than if you're horde on most servers. And faster BG queues when those drop.
---
Also OP isn't saying 1 guy will swing faction balance.
---
ZF graveyard runs I am guessing
---
Perfect yo kiting
---
What is the plugin that shows all those item details?
---
ah, environmental storytelling in games
---
A more likely explanation is the drop rate is unintentionally higher than it should be.
---
When my friend wants me to get out of the house but I just wanna stay home so I act stupid
---
You can fear beast if they're in any form other than caster. Wyvern sting their mana away.
---
Not really. It's certain situations.
---
Depends which faction dominates it.
---
If it's overpopulated with Ally Hordies have the hardmode experience.
---
I see what you did there
---
There was also one with 2 3-minute mages with MC and ZG burst trinket duoing Scholomance. And people say that all-mage groups are a new thing.
---
That's slot of ppl tbh that place has great loot
---
It can proc on hit effects like flurry. Im not sure about windfury, but other things like chance to send fireball at target on hit, hamstring can proc.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Well, don't leave us hanging... What was he lying about?
---
Watch the YouTube videos of „Rextroy“ he explains the current state of Reckoning and also offers advice on useful macros.
---
You can do stockades. That’s about it
---
It’s kinda hard to want to fight horde when you’re by yourself and you know the 6 other dudes on their side are just gonna come in and stomp you the moment you attack.  It sucks cause then you got a group of horde in your quest area killing you the moment you spawn.
---
How do you not mention mana management under a con for shadow?? An OOM shadow priest is in the worst position out of any caster class imo. Drink, drink, and drink is basically a shadow priest in a BG. Ele shamans also have pretty poor mana management.
---
Frost mage 
---
SL lock
---
Shadow priest 
---
Holy pally 
---
Elemental Shaman 
---
Balance Druid
---
Enhance isn’t that good, unless they out gear you, surprise you, or get REAL lucky
---
There is a site called booty bay gazette. I'm pretty sure its subscription based though. During beta everyone had sub privileges but that was changed (last I check - it's been a couple weeks)
---
I immediately switch to ret aura if not in it. They’re my easiest kill if they don’t sprint/vanish away.
---
Elemental is tough to level, enhance may be better for that.  As far as running oom, your bread and butter spell is going to be just regular lightning bolt, it's your most efficient spell.  Your shocks can run you OOM quick, so play around with your rotation.  As you cast LB and mobs are chewing on you, you're gonna get spellcasting pushback and it sucks - such is life as an elemental shaman.  Basically every damage class with mana has the capability to go OOM in 1 or 2 mobs while in leveling gear - so take that with a grain of salt.  
---
If I was leveling an ele shaman, I would pull with a lightning bolt, flame shock, and then spam lightning until the mob is dead.  If you need to interrupt something, bind rank 1 earth shock  and use that - it wont do much damage but it will interrupt.
---
That sounds pretty rough.  I've yet to have a single group even mention DPS.  It's just been chill groups every time.
---
Can a loot expert explain to me what happens when people tie a roll? I had that happen and didn't get the gear. Guy said it was because he clicked it first but I'm not sure if that's it
---
It is not the ONLY one.    There are are several alliance dominated servers and several horde ones and some that are fairly balanced.
---
I play this game solo 75% of the time, but i do enjoy grouping up for dungeons. Anyone saying this game is better in groups or that it's required is just their opinion. I enjoy the open world and seeing it busy with other people still makes it come alive. Just find what makes you happy. It could be fishing in remote areas, grinding elite or difficult mobs, the storyline, trade/professions, auction/economy, etc
---
Sounds real fun when all the alliance have left...
---
Are those the only 2 addons you use? That's called a tooltip, and this one in particular looks like TipTac.
---
The charms isn’t what I’m really farming, each elemental fire goes for about 1,4g
---
Horde has Shaman.   I feel that's a selling point to me.  :)
---
It still checks out. I checked it. So check that off your checklist
---
World boss competition is not a faction balance issue but a population issue
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Wash yer back?
---
I think the pet bar is disabled by default in elvui. You need it to see the abilities of the mob you mc'd
---
Congrats on the play. I still find it strange that -10 to 30 levels can even hit let alone cast spells against skulls on this game. It’s long been a reference to have hit gear at level 60 pvp but low levels have zero problems chomping down a skull in this phase.
---
Horde orc, cant change my years of tradition 😀
---
It is a racial that removed CC. Thus, an anti-CC racial. How is that hard to understand? Furthermore, since the initial version of it removed any CC (not just stuns as it does now), it allowed humans to use 2 stat trinkets instead of one and a CC trinket. The fact that people give up a trinket slot for anti-CC in and of itself speaks for how powerful CC is, and how powerful CC negation is. 
---
Stoneform is good, yes, but given the choice between that or being able to negate anything that causes you to lose control of your character, the choice is pretty simple.
---
Do any census on skeram? Really feels like most of the alliance abandoned ship.
---
I consider myself casual and just hit level 52 on my main.  Having a blast so far, just wish I had more long play sessions so I could run more dungeons.  I end getting a lot of 30-60 minute sessions which is enough time to go grind or do some questing, but not long enough for dungeon runs...
---
They are easy to kite, go oom quickly, and only win when windfury procs. I'm not sure I'd even call enhancement an above average pvp class/spec.
---
If you are having trouble with them or are one then I'm assuming you are not 60 yet. They are much more powerful while leveling. At 60 their damage really nosedives and other classes finally get their full kit.
---
You know you don’t have to name your macros when it’s super obvious what it does.  Like instead of naming your cleave macro “cleave”. You can just put a space where the name goes. Then your UI will look cleaner
---
Ick
---
Yeah, I don't enjoy that either.
---
But I fucking love to spam dungeons , especally Stratholme UD which drops a shit-ton of items, and any you happen to get you can disenchant for large glimmering shards or greater eternal (more likely in Strat as the green items are usually 56+). You can also loot all the weapon crates in there to vendor those item for some extra G's.
---
and if you do get one of the rare enchants, you don't even have advertise yourself, people will whisper you instead as the word goes around that you have one of the rare enchants.
---
And when ZG comes out, you get the wizard oil recipe which is basically like selling an alch flask, everyone will need them 24/7 for the rest of vanilla. Except that you don't have to go fish or run after herbs, you can just do dungeons and use your own mats to sell them.
---
So "blow me" with accent. XD
---
I checked the check on the maths, I think it checks out,  but can someone check my works?
---
you sound mad
---
And they're extra easy because only the bad ones fled their original server
---
I consider healing to be fun, but you can get groups that make you want to quit the game lol. The best thing about healing when you get geared and know the dungeons is you can literally carry the dungeon and prevent sooooo many wipes by being a good healer. Healing take in my opinion more knowledge and skill than all the other classes. Downranking, mana management, casting the correct spell at the right time, knowing when to shield, heal or flash heal. I enjoy it a lot especially in MC and Ony. Questing isnt even that bad for me. I normally team up now more though over going solo. Gear will fall into your lap as holy priest I promise you.
---
All this drama and here I am on a PvE server where world PvP can't interfere with whatever I'm doing.
---
That's crazy luck right there
---
Ha, I did a double-take when I saw it. Not because it’s a great name but because I remember they ganked me in Felwood a couple days ago...
---
&gt; But LC is better imo. Is also logical that the core of the guildraid gears first.
---
I have never seen loot council work long-term.
---
Also, your 'logic' doesn't tend to match reality.
---
What actually occurs is that you gear up the privileged few - and then they stop raiding because they no longer need anything (although this is rarely the explicit reason given - it's just that without any incentive to raid further they find other concerns more pressing). Which resets you back to the beginning with your under-geared remaining raiders.
---
In theory, Loot Council works for professional gamers because they have an incentive - money - to continue raiding. But for most players? I'd call Loot Council a 'dealbreaker' when you're looking for a guild.
---
Every single Mage I've grouped with has been some mix of bad, lazy, arrogant, and stuck up. Not one I've grouped with was an even remotely pleasant experience
---
One guild on my server does
---
Fishing!!! It's much more profitable than people think. Once you get to 300 go farm essence of water and winter squid in ashara. Is like 40-100g post hour.
---
imagine judging people off their behavior in a video. You got some irl issues BUDDY
---
Boohoo, poor mages.
---
I think there will be a big decline in active players between some phases but people will come back for pvp and new raids. I think less time before phases is smart
---
That's what I would have thought, except this issue also happens without any buffs on. I wonder if there just is a missing re-application of the talent in question.
---
Made me lol
---
Read my math above. If you were to do Rend runs with one person needing the sword and four mages needing Reed, the mages would still have double the chances of getting their item (7.5% vs ~3.7%). Even if you were to do that run with nine people who need the trinket, they would have the same chance of each getting the trinket as the guy getting the main-hand.
---
Either way, ideally you want to do that run with a group of 6-7, that way by the time one main-hand drops, everyone else will have also gotten their items along the way with some spares to account for replacements.
---
30s per stack of burning pitch
---
About 8s per charm
---
And about 1.4g per elemental fire
---
Melee abilities can be used between swings and can cause the proc
---
Okay but what value can he bring as a branch manager?
---
People want the fastest clear possible and that means sticking to the meta. Even if that means also sticking it to every single hybrid out there. It doesn't matter that it's still possible, that isn't good enough anymore. The meta is all.
---
They love me in that tunnel.
---
I hate post Malone for taking all of Karl’s mail puns.
---
grasp for those straws for dear life!
---
Plus ultra
---
While I agree that 24 hour auctions give you a better chance to sell, I do not agree that it is (always) better.
---
Let's say you have an item that vendors for 2g and you want to sell it for 10g. AH deposit is 2.5% of vendor price per hour, so a 2 hour auction will cost 10s deposit, 8 hour auction will have 40s deposit and 24 hour auction will be 1.2g deposit.
---
Let's also say that if you post one during or before peak time, you have a 40% chance of selling it with an 8 hour auction before you are undercut, or possibly your undercutter gets sold and yours also gets sold. Let's also say that you have a 60% chance of selling it if you post a 24 hour auction, because your undercutter might only take an 8 hour auction, and some times someone wants it the morning after. You only post once per day.
---
With 8 hour auction you are more likely to not sell it and to then lose your deposit, but you lose only 40s each time. If we go by expected value, 40% means two sales per 5 auctions, which gives 1.2g loss from the 3 failed auctions = 0.6g per sold auction.
---
With 24 hours auction you expect 3 sales every 5 auctions. Your two failed auctions cost you 2.4g, which gives 0.8g loss per sold auction. If you go from 40% to 75% sell rate by doing 24 hour instead of 8 hour, you lose 1.2g per 3 sold auctions so 0.4g each sale, if you go from 50% to 75% then both are 0.4g average per sale.
---
It entirely depends on the specific item, its deposit cost, and how often you can log back in and make another auction. For some items I would never go with 24 hour auctions, for others I would always go with 24 hour auctions, and it doesn't depend completely on deposit cost. 
---
For example there can definitely be cases where someone makes 4 2 hour auctions during the evening and lose track of how much they undercut, and while it might sell they've already lost 3 2 hour deposits and the 1.5g they undercut. While the guy that went with a 24 hour auction sells it just fine 16 hours in at his original price and loses nothing.
---
Id only be contributing to the problem of my server being 75/25 Horde, but yeah honestly... I would.. I get camped for hours some nights. BRD has been absolute hell. Never seen a PvP server this bad
---
Did exactly the same thing lol
---
Wasted on a warrior!
---
Not on Deviate Delight. Horde can’t pvp for shit there and I love it.
---
The crit proc, I like sword my and dagger oh as well
---
Some people just suck. As a fellow Warlock, I do my part to contribute with demon utility and asking "need Healthstones?" after every pull that was iffy
---
I like the UI I am currently using, and It is pretty straightforward to customize things, I guess I am really just asking what that display window is called and if there is a way to alter it in Shadow Unit frames or bartender. I would try a different UI handler if I need to, but I have to figure out the name of that window either way. Maybe I could test Elvui on a different character to see, it is possible some UI Addons just change this window by default
---
Wtf are those alliance players doing? Fight for your allies you weak minded alliance scum.
---
There are no dishonorable kills when it comes to defending your allies.
---
Unless I'm missing something it just drops randomly from mons in that level range, the monster that dropped it doesn't make it more interesting.
---
The real luck is not having those other party members in range to roll on loot.
---
I still can't believe Arthas wanted to blow up a bomb during the Lordaeron 5K.
---
I forgot about this one
---
Yeah it is subscription, get a few days free.
---
Just try elemwntal shaman they can be the real killer if you play it right but remember its a support class
---
What’s the addln that shows chat that way.... can’t seem to find it
---
Love heartseeker. Came from Stalagg as a Horde in the last wave specifically because of the imbalance. Now I get to kill as many alliance players as I want! Definitely the server to be on if you're horde and actually like pvp.
---
I have a rogue main and a druid alt for this reason. Stealth and escape tools.
---
The addon name is Prat.
---
Calling it IPA deserves 30000 downvotes, but we can always start with the one.
---
Why would you fight a shammy, they are horde brothers and sisters lol Zug zug
---
Man... and here I am 34 runs since I last saw the mainhand and lost it on a tie roll
---
for me big thing they carried over from retail is modern frames both party/raid and player/target frame that can be moved.
---
Nope zandalar tribe - EU
---
If you tie a greed/need roll the game does and internal hidden roll between the affected
---
No. Defense skill does not give you dodge rating. Defense skill shifts the combat table, based on the enemy's combat skill.
---
In effect, defense skill raises your dodge via the combat formula, but it does not raise your character sheet dodge% because your character sheet does not account for all the levels of mobs.
---
"I am the one who rocks"
---
Try SM Lib. Friend of mine is MS warrior and gets 30G/h
---
And it's in enemy territory and the rogue doesn't have PvP enabled.
---
damn, it's shocking, the amount of people here that really have no clue
---
This is not on my server! So the UI is completly unconfigured.
---
Holy shit this is one of the best things ever. I didn't even notice the name I was supposed to be watching until the last part, but that makes it 10/10 rewatching it from the top.
---
I was thinking of this build. But still unsure on what talents in sub are necessary to pick up. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/02-30235501005001002-050051132030101
---
When? I thought they were low dps and never played.
---
How do you know it's a lamp?
---
Grats mate
---
sorry for the off topic question but what ui is that?
---
Rofl cant wait to camp pussies like you with my entire guild from the menethil rooftop.
---
This is what phase 2 is gunna be about. Shouldnt have rolled pvp server.
---
Inb4 bootlickers "b-but blizzard TOS!!" Rofl stfu u fucking clown, supporting rules made by the same company that ruined the game in the 1st place. C ya phase 2 bitch
---
Good point. I'd just add that the Tauren are the "good guys" on the Horde.
---
It’s certainly worth knowing. That’s one of the main reasons why I personally avoided shadow priest despite maining one in TBC and WOTLK where mana management became a breeze. I’d recommend that OP plays around with a hybrid disc spec, which works off shadows weaknesses and still allows you to do really solid damage.
---
As a healer, if a mage doesn't give me water, he doesn't get heals. He can use his food.
---
&gt;Pre BRD it literally is.
---
Shit this changes everything, I always thought UBRS was after BRD. Thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson my friend!
---
He could technically be a boa, as some groups [still have vestigial hindlegs](https://images.app.goo.gl/GxtaqVnj3bSF5hMi6).
---
We've talked about it a few times in guild, as there are a few other guilds on Arugal who have an Eye now too.  We've been making the joke of legion legendary bad luck protection being in, but it's too early to tell for sure if it's just incredible luck on the eyes or if something else is going on with loot drops.
---
Yes, 100% a hunter weapon.
---
Stay in berserker stance with ravager and spam whirlwind and mortal strike.  You don’t need to shield tank until BRD
---
Swim north of dark shore along the moon glade coast and then drown when you enter the moon glade chat
---
I hit 60 today too. 
---
Why did so many retail players tell me that at points you have to grind because there are not enough quests in the game? I never had to do that. I also never grinded dungeons either. Just once for the quests.
---
Whatever makes you feel powerful I guess, when I'm on my Mage alt I just give 2-3 stacks to the healer without saying anything, because they'll never "not need it". 
---
No fuss, no drama, just click that button and make some water while I'm **waiting anyway**. 
---
Guess some people just feel the need to make a 'thing' out of it.
---
Yeah no he doesn’t, quit yer bullshit without screenshots.
---
Do you know how much a Fort buff costs my guy? 
---
It’s 750 mana in case you didn’t. 
---
2-3 water casts are nothing when your priest has to sit and drink to full after buffs anyway.
---
Oh you naive soul
---
Or just search the name of the mount even on this sub brings up 4-5 posts
---
Instead of sticking the path (Winterspring), bank a right for moonglade about mid way thru the tunn, if you see a named a blue furbolg you are on the right track, ppl don't generally kill um due to rep loss
---
Just got our second one this week!
---
I also did this but by corpse hopping as a mage. I ressed right behind the pedestal the quest item is on right after five horde pulled the patrol. I'm not sure if they could see me but it was very tense until I got the item.
---
Currently level 36, but I did get my cooking to 300 and my fishing is a bit over 250. Looking at about 40g overall.
---
Overall I’m having a good time. I don’t get a lot of time to play, but when I do it’s usually on my phone through steam link. This is why I work on fishing and cooking, much easier! 
---
I try to quest when I can, but it’s hard to play on a pvp server while on the phone, as soon as I get attacked it’s pretty much game over. 
---
Still having a blast though!
---
If you're 50+, it's time to look at endgame gear.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true#
---
Devilsaur is potentially your endgame outside raiding gear. This list also gives a craftable helm that looks great for catform ferals.
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/6iCeSL6DcLJqEPH2A4oGPf
---
This is a list created by their point valuing system for "BoE, craftable, quest drops" for feral damage. I do not know if their point scheme is ideal for you or not, BUT you can make your own point scheme and see what items exist in the game that fit your desired model. Imo ignore any purple BoE and find a replacement in their list.
---
Time to stop looking at upgrades and to start saving sheckles for the endgame.
---
Give that man a promo! 🎉
---
That’s the thing! I am arms spect and switched to D stance after charge! Or just had it up when pulling with bow.
---
Oomkin represent!
---
Some zones you should set your alarm for 5 or 6am and knock out the quests.
---
Badlands rock dudes was the worst during peak hours.
---
And if you think you see some teardrops falling down my cheeks then please, please don't tell my mates
---
Sure, here's what mine look like right now.  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVRhsGVoZf0tZx
---
I started with 5 in spirit tap, then went pretty deep into discipline until I didn't really like anything there anymore then started pouring points into holy to be able to better heal these tough dungeons coming up.  
---
I'm definitely no expert here and just kind of flying by the seat of my pants and doing what feels right, but my heals are on point and questing is going just fine so I'm pretty happy with it.
---
Razorchads 😎
---
Well when you present it as only a gankfest that's disingenuous. I was answering your first question.
---
You don't have to roll on a pvp server, just don't complain about imbalance if you're actively causing the problem.
---
Warriors are best suited for farming high level solo mobs such as ogres in deadwind pass.
---
At least in somewhat experienced opinion.  Lots of cloth, greys, health/mana pots, etc.  This all adds up to consistent gold gains.
---
iam12andstreamersmakegamesfun
---
I just find the meta boring. 
---
As a feral druid i have no AOE, so dungeon runs become very boring watching mages aoe everything
---
You forgot to hide character name in TradeSkillMaster info
---
It blows your mind a PvP realm with 70% horde and 30% alliance would have people complaining about outnumbered ganks? You must not have thought through that much
---
Welcome to loot council have some refreshment while we give best gear to friends and grillz
---
I wish you good luck.
---
I originally wanted to play a night elf druid, but since that's what I always play i wanted to do something different for once. Two months later and seems like the good ol' druid is the best choice after all. 
---
Problem now is RP-PvP vs RP-PvE, which means I can chose between two servers. Do I go for Zandalar, which is more popular and will be more immersive, at the cost of ganking, slower leveling times and hindrance when RPing in PvP zones? Do I go for Hydraxian, which is more casual and lets me go at my own pace, at the cost of a medium-populated server and lack of world pvp?
---
I can't decide man.
---
Alliance already camped the shit out of him and killed all the flightpaths he got near... Horde dont want him either so it seems to work itself out
---
Which one
---
Tank and healer here. 
---
If you behave this way in my group, you'll have to find another group. You'll keep looking while in 5 minutes I have another Mage who will use their abilities and stop being an obnoxious drama queen.
---
Engis can open locked chests too though
---
Nice! Welcome to the horde! Have fun!
---
We're going to have cross realm BGs so the faster BG queue point is moot.
---
Alliance on this server. I’ve been camped by 60’s throughout the last 2 weeks in duskwood at the cemeteries. Just killing level 25’s and killing the quest givers for hours. There’s one rogue in particular that has literally been there all week. I went and made alts so I could play without being ganged for a while. 
---
I only get 30-40 minutes at a time to level usually with my schedule right now so it’s been pretty frustrating.
---
Hi, /u/Mythrellas

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/de45vd/is_the_mongoose_boots_pattern_in_phase_1/).

This Is may be a shock, possibly even a frost shock. But we have lots of tools but all have been half assed. Our tremor lets warlocks kill and fear us for a while. Our zero stun policy lets mages kite the fuck out of us. Our mail armor is chewed through by wars. Rogues, we can probably kill, huntards just kite us. Druids just stay alive forever and you get bored fighting them.

Best counter is mage i believe.

Not to balance out the ratios. But I have tried making an Alliance multiple times. Being a short-arse with a beard n growing my hair out, I connected with the Dorfs on a real level.

Just being an Alliance seems more of a pain to me, after all these years as Horde. I didn't know where anything was or the like; I mean, if that unknowing injected magic back into the game for me, that would be great. But it didn't, so it isn't. 
---
I'm still jumping about due to being an altaholic, so we'll see what happens!
---
Probably SM but the gph is not going to be very good.
---
Not really because in my personal experience I don't know anyone who buys tokens.
---
This is a 2 night Mythic raiding guild also, people you would probably expect to want to get gold easily as they dont have spare time.
---
&gt;  I would rather there be gold sellers, as the result would be much less gold transferred through third parties.
---
this doesn't make sense
---
Survivorship bias indeed
---
This guy mains mage.
---
Haha me too! Same server. I had a couple good fights with equal leveled people, but they made it clear it was fight time - let me kill my mob and heal up before starting anything. The uppers would just drop off their mount, kill me, and leave :(
---
Pro tip:  put pummel on your action bar as action button 9 or something that you barely ever use. Then change the key binding for 9 to whatever button you want your pummel to be. 
---
That way when you change to defensive stance you can have shield bash on 9 and no macro needed. 
---
The only stance  that requires a macro is battle stance and that one is easy “/cast berserk stance /cast pummel”  it only works if you have at least 2 points in tactical mastery.
---
Paladin question:
---
How do reckoning stacks store? Can I heal with 1h+shield and then swap to 2h without losing stacks? If not, and I swap then swap back, will I get my stacks back?
---
I saw a rogue farming brd pick pocketing video and he pick pockets the spectators in the arena. Don’t they eventually become friendly if you do arena enough?
---
Hey, sorry missed the comment. I whispered them and they immediately logged off in unison.  It was a bot imo but if Blizzard determined otherwise then ok.
---
Imagine they would need on it too
---
Same, man. Luckily Blaumeux has the closest 50/50 split out of all the pvp servers (according to one census chart, but who knows how reliable those are). There's a healthy amount of PvP on both sides, at least in the high 40s  from my experience, but very balanced. Horde tend to gank in groups of 2-3 more often (again, just from what I've seen), but I can't say I've ever had a problem finding a few people in general chat to help get them back, so it evens out.
---
As if Dwarves would drink a craft IPA... They'd drink something much manlier.
---
I've heard a lot of people talk about the lowest /played, but does that usually account for rested? I would think the best time would be only playing with rested, which would slow you down overall but have a big impact on /played.
---
Good old Kurinaxx! Gratz Ligmah -
---
I’ve seen you around :)
---
The first thing I do in every game is tweak the video options. Do people really not even look at the settings?
---
When MC became soloable in WOTLK, I cleared it once a week for 9 months before I got the eye or rag to drop.  Here's a guild who got 2 in 5 weeks.  There's gonna be a world first TF very soon I'm sure.
---
Edit: TF is not possible until BWL releases,  but I predict there will be TFs that first week after release.
---
Something I never understood, you cannot fly to Ratchet from Auberdine or Astrannar, but you can fly to Theramore from these two locations...
---
I think you really nailed the ages. Back in the days when I was like 14 I was a Horde player. I also had my Emo phase and loved occult shit lmao. I remember even then though that Alliance was the more mature one. Even as a Horde player I had that weird feel that I will probably find more adults on the other side. Well rolling now after about 10 years I seriously couldn't have brought myself to roll Horde because I no longer wish to be a corpse or shrek lol + I kinda know there have to be people like my 14 years old self and I sure as hell want to avoid that. Now I'm by no means saying Horde is kids only. Plenty of my friends are Horde. But I think you're onto something atleast. If anyone has an opposite impression I'd love to hear that this seems like a pretty interesting topic tbh.
---
Be careful with wanding and tab. You can accidentally shoot a random mob and that’s a big bad in a dungeon. 
---
Wand doesn’t stop between tabbing.
---
Its a dire maul pattern. It has a chance to be in knot thimblejacks box when you free him.
---
I died over 20x in duskwood (incendius) because level 60s would roam the graves for hours until an alliance 60 would come. On 3 different occasions (22, 26, 29) Horde sat on top of buildings in darkshire killing everyone who landed or tried to talk to a quest giver. They would even jump down and wipe out the inside of buildings before resetting via the roof. I’ve played horde in vanilla, TBC, wotlk, cata, and legion and I’ve never had a leveling experience as full of griefing by 60s. I’ve also been attacked on sight more often by similar level players but I’m a shadow priest so it’s basically a suicide mission for the horde player(s). I observed the hillsbrad advantage and definitely slapped around horde on the road as I ran to alterac but only because I was so tilted by the horde 60s that I needed to balance the scales.
---
The twitch app should have a lot of tooltip addons for you to use. Most of them should give you the option to move your tooltip anchor. I know Tiptac is a really popular one for retail but I’m not sure if it is available for classic.
---
There should also be an option in your settings to have the tooltip anchored to your mouse so that when you hover over things, the tooltip is right on your mouse. If that sounds nice you could try that but i personally don’t like that.
---
Try not to get discouraged too much. There are a lot of shitty people out there but the good thing about games is that once you know they're shitty you won't ever have to deal with them again.
---
When you do groups, just tell them that you're new and still figuring things out. Most people will be patient and some may even want to help teach you things. Some will be dickheads, but try not to let them get to you.
---
And if it ever gets too overwhelming, just go out and quest or grind by yourself for a while. There's a ton to do in the game by yourself.
---
I think he meant MS
---
Iirc they're posted at 1k gold on noggenfogger-eu. Smaller guilds can fund so much with that amount of gold
---
This is news to me. I hope not though, as I think I'll feel more comfortable with DKP.
---
with all these legendaries popping up and bindings dropping already i would not be surprised at all if the legion legendary forgiveness for not getting one in 8 weeks made its way into classic some how.
---
I've been exposed.
---
This is just stupid. In a few weeks everyone in the guild that can wield it will have it.
---
Ok.
---
Whenever I try to tell a video game badass moment to my wife I realize how goofy it sounds and feel bad for talking about it. There was no reason for me to be half as excited about that as I was. But I thought that rogue in 2nd place was gonna do the winning so the warrior was an unexpected surprise.

When Moonglade is the only quest point for Silithus...

&gt; My favorite is when multiple people have the quest and each person loots the quest item. Like oh hey we looted his head 5 times.
---
*Flashbacks to goddamn EQ where that was very much not the case*
---
I keep telling mages that are stingy with water that fort (the lower fort) cost 750 mana pet cast, but they’re too concerned about the 3 sec cast to make water.
---
Lmao, I'm level 37 and have 12g.
---
I've been considering Alchemy as well, but how important is it to have Herbalism to be able to profit/fully enjoy Alchemy? Not sure if I want to drop skinning, as farming Devilsaur leather might be lucrative.
---
... Ok you clearly just ready the top comment and regurgitated their thought. I guess we found what's more sad than a recklessness clip.
---
This kinda creates a paradox because if someone really was good he would be picking Alliance to kill the "good" Hordies. I mean competitive people love challenge so they should be rolling the underdog.
---
I find myself camping more as alliance only because it’s fights that I didn’t start. If 2 people gank me and lose I’m going to camp them for a half hour to teach them a lesson.
---
he doesn’t know...
---
Why didn’t y’all round robin the stones like righteous orbs?
---
Some of us aren’t morons I promise!  I show up to dungeons with 2 stacks of water per person extra ready to go. I buff myself at the same time that I buff everyone else so that I know when to rebuff everyone. 
---
We get a bad rap because there are a lot of assholes rolling mage. Some of us just like the class though. I’ve been trying to do some community outreach so I stand in org offering free water and portals at cost (18s for me) and say no tips. I figure that if people see a nice mage they may not hate all of us.
---
If you were healing the instance then you should keep it. It’s a great healing head and it doesn’t matter that you are a pala and it’s cloth, it’s a healing item and you as the healer can equip it, so it should go to you.
---
I'd say ds/ruin since it includes improved healthstone.
---
This^ SO much this. 
---
Especially if your group can actually wait 3 seconds for them to get aggro and swipe a few times.
---
Bear tanks are dungeon masters! 
---
I’ve lived through some things we definitely should’ve wiped on by having druids innervate me.
---
You can also shift-click a name in chat to see level and class.
---
Holy nova costs quite a bit of mana and doesn't do good damage so it's not very effective.
---
The scaling is really bad.
---
Not my proudest fap... but this will do
---
Thanks. İ will go with holy priest.
---
Druids get to Teleport there at level 10, I always thought it would be a nice bit of fluff if Druids at a higher level could open a portal to Moonglade.  As has been noted in this thread, there isn’t much there outside of a Mara quest and the moon festival if/when seasonal events appear in classic.   I just think it could be cool and in character.
---
Complaints of imbalance by oceanic Horde are valid, too. It’s the same problem
---
Fucking hated the legendaries in legion being random drops instead of somehow tied to the class hall or something. BIS gear piece drops off a random crab... uh ok.
---
I wouldn’t trust him he sounds fishy.
---
How do I get better at targeting, especially in dungeons? I tab target at the moment but, as a rogue, sometimes when the group kills a mob, then I tab target the next mob, I’ll stand there like an idiot waiting to attack cause I won’t start autoing right away with tab and I’m out of energy for SS. I also try to just right click the next mob but if there in a cluster of dead mobs I’ll loot or something.
---
Rng is real. On Sulfuras my guild got an Eye and a Binding in the same run.
---
Sometimes I think there's a sub culture of a competitive casual oxymoron with this game. People competing on how flakey they can be in a game. I'm pretty casual myself, but if you're dropping a monthly sub for 10 minutes of gameplay a week, that's just getting into weird territory.
---
Idk why you whinny ally people think it's hard mode on alliance, when I wasted an hour of my life thanks to 2 of your buds trolling/ganking people just wanting to do BFD.
---
PVP is hard mode in general, doesn't matter what side you are on.
---
The rogue wouldn't have gotten to the chest without the party.
---
&gt; I'm not saying you shouldnt make water. I always make water for the group. But 60 water per caster? Thats a bigger time investment than you realise.
---
Do you know how much Arcane Intellect buff costs? 945 mana for the level-equivalent to your 750 mana fort buff.
---
Do you know how much Conjure Water costs? 420 mana per 6 water, not 6 stacks, 6 water, at the same level you can cast your 750 mana fort buff. 
---
To give you 60 water at the same level youre casting a 750 int for buff would cost 4200 mana, or ~1-1.5 mana bars if youre well geared. For just the priest, not every caster. And thats only level 35 water, so it only restores ~2000 mana if you drink for the whole 30 seconds.
---
I think all the Alliance guilds on thalnos use loot council.
---
Inner focus + fort has become more common than using it to cast a heal!
---
I hate snowflakes who shit talk you then ignore.
---
The faction that has Will of the Forsaken has been the majority in almost every single PvP server for 15 years fam, that's just how it is.
---
Mine wasnt at 3. I am 100% sure of that. Other people commented that theirs were at 7 too. I thought it was odd too when i first launched classic. My guess is that it imported my retail settings.
---
The problem is retail more than anything. Everyone coming over with guilds and groups are not switching factions.
---
Oh there's the Akshully. 
---
You'll get it when it no longer matters, is that better for you?

I'm sorry mate. Blizzard said no, reddit said no. Its the end of the line
---
Get a vulture pet to tank, ya bum
---
If you ever find yourself on Mograine as an alliance character hit me up. I enjoy the game slow and we've all been new to the game at one point. You gotta start somewhere and I'm sure reddit has lots of people who will be patient and understanding of your situation.
---
I choose to believe that when a mob doesn't drop an item that they should have (bat wing, prowler claw, etc.) it's because the player destroyed it during battle and it's no longer salvageable.
---
This man is a millionaire for being bad at video games and yelling stupid things at people he's never met. What a time to be alive.
---
I am 100% convinced that the drop rate for legendaries has been increased. 
---
I have no way to prove it, but it’s just incredible unlikely how many guilds are getting these so early.
---
Video settings in the menu if I recall correctly. Easy to find.
---
In my experience the only people who cause drama are the loot whores.
---
Note as well that Holy Nova does not generate any threat.
---
It really is only useful for forcing a rogue out of stealth :)
---
"geez why are you playing a PvE server thats so boring"
---
this is exactly why i didnt want a pvp server
---
I always keep People hydrated, it is a part of My role, same with giving a portal for free in the end. Though, i do also expect People to start clearing trash, while i make it for them.
---
Laughs in stoneskin
---
I think he's on to something!
---
How are you buffing the opposite faction?
---
damn so many legendarys dropping everyone will run around with them, I guess its just another item now. Every server has TFs dropped and a couple of rag hammers. Boooring it aint legendary items no more, scuffed loot table deluxe.
---
This is pure gold. If I could, I'd award you

for blizz it is?  wat about frostbolt?  thx

Make an auto attack macro.

No shit sherlock, this game came out 15 years ago when he was 10
---
You're doing classic completely wrong if you're not talking and engaging with people (and that's a negative for you). You can make entire gaming and out of game friendships in classic with ease. Just talk with people, do dungeons, play the game.
---
Im sorry you didnt get main/2nd tank spot man.

That trinket tho... once the first part of hell is complete, the rest was pretty easy to get with no competition.

---
Oh I know, I've been playing Druid lately. I was excited to go their the first time! That quickly soured once I learned I had to take like a 5-8 minute FP back to TB or Hearth to leave that place. Would rather Org just have a Druid trainer tbh.

No need to be a prick my dude. It’s a call for help.

How is that being a prick I’m asking a legitimate question so fuck off.
---
As I recall, the spectators become neutral after completing the arena event in that copy of the instance.  There is no way to make them neutral long term.
---
how do trolls eat or talk with those things?? I mean they are clearly coming out of the side of the mouth so it makes closing the lips impossible, I wonder how much they prevent them from even chewing??
---
No wonder they are so skinny.
---
Do they plan on adding character changes or stuff like realm changes in the future
---
It’s not 2004 now, people have had 15 years to learn exactly what needs to b done.  They get everything in place and then have been extremely lucky with the drops.
---
i find it so hard to keep aggro when fury specced playing tank
---
Good to know
---
Level 38 ATM.
---
NGL compared to first couple of weeks of every wake minute spent thinking about the game, fatigue is starting to kick in, which is probably not too bad since I was neglecting RL a bit.
---
Overall things are mostly good. Questing the Desolace atm (I know, lagging behind 5 levels or so, but I find it more comfortable compared to questing near\above my level). Only have about 20g in my purse though, but even if I won't get the mount at 40 that's not a biggie, I actually enjoy walking most of the times.
---
Pickpocketing is fun. Having stealth and lots of disengage is awesome, I can puff out of most sticky situations I end up getting into.
---
Poisons are fun. They let me fine-tune my kit according to the types of mobs I hunt, a bit. Lots of casters? Mind-numbing. Runners? Crippling. Etc.
---
Had been neglecting my fishing and cooking so it's a bit of a problem now... Can't catch shit at my leveling zones, can't cook the meat that's dropping from the mobs i kill...
---
Not a fun of dungeons, though. Having company is cool, but it's basically running around an unfamiliar place and mindlessly DPSing waves and waves of mobs. RFK and RFD are bearable, but SM is just mind-numbingly monotone. I swear if I hear "RELUISE THE HOUNDS" one more time... I basically go to dungeons now only to complete my quests.

No one gives a shit if little timmy raider gets upset he didn't get his mainhand. It starts affecting your game when the people in charge of distributing loot aren't actually unbiased.
---
This, ESPECIALLY an Orc warrior who benefit far more from axes. Here's the priority:
---
* Retribution Paladins
---
* Non-Orc Enhancement Shamans
---
* Non-Orc Warriors who will use it by going Arms spec for raiding (providing Mortal Strike on bosses like Ebonroc, very important). You only want one of these in your raid.
---
* Orc Enhancement Shamans
---
* Other Warriors who will use it for PvP
---
In a random sample of 7 runs, getting 2 Sulfuras is something like 0.02^2 x 0.98^5 x 21 (there are 6+5+4+3+2+1=21 sequences in which 7 runs can yield 2 drops) ~= 0.76%. And the probability of at least 2 drops is actually higher, but that's gonna be fairly negligibly so. You'd only need about 85 guilds to have done 7 runs since launch to get a 50% likelihood of this occurring.
---
It’s also my first time playing but I’ve been progressing quickly and learning a lot with a lot of thanks to my guild mates in &lt;BEEF&gt;. You have a spot on our roster for some no pressure gaming fun if you ever decide you want to play on Thunderfury. :)

Mine is currently out for delivery.

I'm an Elemental Shaman. Should I be wearing armor with +Nature Damage or Int/Spirit? I have some issues with mana, but would prefer to dish out more damage than reduce downtime so I was thinking prioratize +Nature Damage &gt; Spirit &gt; Int &gt; Stam. Also, what is the equivalence between points in +Nature Damage vs. Int. I saw on another thread related to Warlocks that it is something like 1 +Dmg = +10 or 12 Int. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
---
Just a helpful tip, they can't sacrifice the voidwalker if it is CCed, I don't know if the voidboi can be specifically blinded though.
---
Ok that would be pretty awesome, not sure how I hadn't heard of ironfoe before
---
Audio source https://youtu.be/hyNu5i_6lKA

Haha that’s awesome! How many members do you have? I run a bank alt guild with 275 members!
---
Never join a pug that you'd be pissed off with any of the attendees winning something over you. In World of Warcraft, it's going to happen, the 56 that was doing 13 dps is going to win.
---
I mean you can turn that off in settings
---
Find mail armor with str/stam.
---
So thats the only shoulders enchant in vanilla? Do u happen to know the cost of the one u get from exalted?
---
You'd think so, but the truth is what competitive people love more than challenge is winning.
---
Having an opinion on something isn't 'Gatekeeping'
---
*Laughs while totem twisting*
---
Having a blast. I get about 2-4 hours in the evenings with lots of distractions. My favorite time is waking up at 5am to get 2-2 1/2 peaceful hours of full immersion.
---
I’m not too interested in hardcore raiding. My goal is to gear up in dungeons and occasionally get a raid on a weekend night. I think with this being an old game, with a classic rule set that is not going anywhere m, even Casuals can beat this game. I think 1% of content may be elusive. (Scarab lord quest or whatever,thunderfury, beating nax?)
---
I swear I saw an add on that makes you into an automated store. Perhaps that could be useful.
---
So wish I would have jumped on this. What’s your favorite item?
---
There was a mage offering to carry people through SM on my server as long as you gave them the greens (high level mage so it might have made it worth it).. then he went on to talk about 3g per run as well
---
He got lit up in chat about it, and I can’t even imagine someone taking him up on that offer
---
Ok thx
---
\&gt; Obviously I should never grab aggro, but I ended up hardly being able to use my abilities
---
I understand why you would have that idea, but it's very wrong. If you're a dps warrior, there's nothing wrong with you having aggro on trash. Mobs in dungeons generally do not hit hard, and you pulling aggro means more rage and mobs die faster. The damage gained far outweighs the small amount of extra mana the healer spends on you. If your group really wants to be methodical about it then sure, avoid aggro. Overall tho, it's not necessary.
---
I am currently healing UBRS runs with 3 fury warriors wearing leather and no real tank and we've had zero deaths in 4 runs. Shields are overrated. From the time warriors get cleave until 60, dps tanking is perfectly viable and you shouldn't worry too much about pulling aggro.
---
You shall not take Merlin’s beard’s name in vain.
---
I would try to get at least 30 . Pretty sure you are underestimating it.
---
I keep seeing people say this but it’s 100% not true at all, stop spreading this false information.
---
Holy shit, some people are braindead.
---
Yeah imagine humans every actually being unbiased lmao.
---
The main purpose of LC is that you can direct loot so it's most efficient: guess what, the content is a complete fucking joke and this is 100% unnecessary. People don't need their 8 set before anyone else gets gear.
---
Hm, maybe you're right - i'll have to look into it. 
---
edit: Oh shit, is the 3 second internal CD not in classic??
---
I will join Mograine thx.
---
This is what I did as well.  Shadow questing up until 57 then was able to heal any dungeon for xp
---
I’m not usually a fan on being mean but this is the right comment at the right time.
---
My friends and I are all on biggles, but only lvl 30 or so.
---
I thought the population is about 55h/45a. Is that not true? What makes ally insane mode?
---
Literally impossible, the level 60s don’t aggro the guard in that spot but if you’re actually level appropriate for the zone, aka mid 40s the guards will still aggro you so it’s impossible to defend yourself.
---
I think the drop tables are consistent with vanilla, some people/guilds have tons of luck and that's all there is to it.  There are going to be guilds who cleared MC weekly for a year who dont have 1 single TF or hand of rag.  There will be other guilds who have a couple TF's in 6 months.  Why would blizzard alter the loot tables after we cried so much about no changes?
---
Ehh the whole beauty of fury tanking is how easy it is to hold agro. You must be doing something wrong.
---
what the hell is this. this is a pvp weapon. that's it
---
If you don’t want to give people water in dungeons then don’t become a mage, it’s that simple. This is like a holy priest refusing to heal and telling people they should bring pots and bandages.
---
As a tank paladin the stats you want are strength and stamina. There are other things to worry about but at your level those are the 2 big ones. Also yes mail gear is best because of the armor bonus
---
I think the AQ quest line spends a lot of time there (I think i did that on my pally).
---
it's not false information. 2 mages on my server are exalted and they can kill ppl next to guards.
---
I think this was recently used in retail wasn’t it? A dead old god Lieutenant that they resurrected for the Darkshore warfront or something.
---
Humans try to find patterns in things that are random, we're so prone to do it we've even named a fallacy after it
---
The first and only time I've seen shadowfang mentioned as best is on the classicwow twink guide. In its defense, it says assassins blade is equally as good but I can't quiete understand the logic that it beats out assassins blade.
---
Between the damage multipliers of of ambush and backstab I just don't see it winning.
---
I could meet half way and say the "best" twink should have 2 assassins blades and swap to a shadowfang when going head to head with someone and not stealthed, but that becomes situational at best.
---
Well, I now have three level 20+ and three level 10+, fml. If I could just focus on one toon I'd be much less poor and much closer to 60 lol. 
---
I'm also still looking for an Alliance guild on Bloodsail Buccaneers that doesn't in-guild dungeon runs and could use a ~~shitty~~ priest! I will pay for repair if we wipe and it was my fault, hit me me up! PUGs scare me lmao.
---
Go to the auction house and buy an Ornate spyglass. Run into the top left corner before the first mobs, use the spyglass and after it zoomed in do /tar jed
---
The spyglass increases the tracking range and the range for /tar aswell. No need to wait for 3 minutes this way.
---
DK teleported to 3rd place out of nowhere.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a different route because you are leaving on a Griffin and arriving on a hippogriff.
---
That’s your opinion. My guild is prepping for server firsts for bwl. We aim to be the best regardless of the content. Why should I give little timmy eye of divinity over a priest who was at every raid and is significantly better at healing than he is? This same priest who regularly helps out guild mates and donates to the guild? But no you’re right lets give the loot to the new guy who is getting carried.
---
We don't like your kiiiiind around here.
---
You can put 30sp on 2 handers, its a common misconception that you cant.
---
Oh yeah PvP is super fun, if your server is full you may have a free transfer option hopefully you could choose a pvp server.
---
They can kill people next to guards because the aggro radius is so broken it’s ridiculous. it has nothing to do with rep, that would be the dumbest shit in the world if you can get exalted with guards and just wreak havoc on low levels in neutral zones while nobody else is even able to touch you. Stop trying to spread misinformation.
---
Omg didn’t know that hahah that blows
---
Don’t use heroic strike or cleave if you are doing so
---
Just make an alt on a pvp server. You can play multiple characters.
---
Druids have issues with a good portion of the bosses not working correctly with their class. Teh drakes all have thrash which can really ruin a druids day since they don't reach uncrittable/uncrushable with a single button press and can get deleted out of existence by pure RNG even in the best of gear. They can't tank Nef because he straight up can put them into cat form if he so desires and they still can't deal with fear of course. They're pretty much garbage at doing razorgore compared to the stupidity you can do with warriors tha tallow you to kite every single melee add forever.
---
BWL is pretty much the reason druids aren't tanks in raids. Because there's some RNGesus bullshit and stuff designed specifically to make them incapable of doing it.
---
Hey dude, I do BRD pickpocket runs and I make between 20-50 gold per hour usually. If you don't die too much/get resisted and you get lucky with drops it's pretty lucrative economy proof gold. I just made a video because I saw your post -- it's a bit long and I'm going to cut it down and edit fast fowards into parts but I wanted to give you the option to check it out pretty much raw footage since you seem to be clamoring for an "updated reliable" video.
---
Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFnLtZh2Y&amp;feature=youtu.be) I hope you and/or others find it helpful. In this run I make ~25g in 45 minutes and that's with a death because of a resist when my vanish was down. If you include the mooncloth bag pattern I get it's 75g in 45m.
---
You need Elementium Ingots from Blackwing Lair to get Thunderfury.
---
You need elementium from BWL trash to make TF so that won't be happening for a while.
---
I’m pretty sure this is all of us here now
---
Not enough intellect.
---
I skipped my catnin my 30's and got a vulture instead. Very happy with the change as it is way tanker with very little dps drop.
---
To your question: Armour is usually better against  physical mobs since it reduces damage taken. You don't see tanks just stack stamina, they stack defensive stuff like Armour. With that said a combination is usually preferred if you don't know where toy are going, since some mobs might be casters aswell as all talents costs more towards the end, but gives less. So I run rank 8 arm and rank -6-7 stamina or something.
---
For aoe farming you should focus on intellect only.
---
It isn’t facts. Your argument is solely to counter ninjaing- nothing else. Which has merit, but don’t try to make your position something it’s not because it just undermines your point.
---
It's called tooltip. At least in elvui
---
You realize humans have sword AND mace spec as racial right?
---
And in the end, as the other guy said, whether it's a mace or not, it's mainly a PvP weapon.
---
&gt;That’s your opinion. My guild is prepping for server firsts for bwl.
---
I mean, grats to you. Spend your months on end prepping for 2 hours worth of content.
---
&gt;Why should I give little timmy
---
If you actually care about such meaningless achievements as that above, you don't raid with little timmy, you aren't part of this discussion. If you do raid with little timmy, you aren't getting server firsts.
---
This is just my personal opinion, but I dont categorize rested xp differently at all. You get.. what, 5% rested xp per 8 hours? With a maximum amount of 150% reset xp, this comes out to 150/5 * 8, for a total of 240 offline hours (10 days offline) to get max rested xp (someone please correct me if I'm mistaken on this). So.. if someone hits max level my accumulating rested xp by stopping for 10 days at a time to use it up, then continue 10 days later, good on them, but they would take many months just to hit that max. In the end, they may have less /played than anyone else, but I wouldn't categorize them any different than someone who plays for nearly 4 days straight to hit that maximum. Their strategy would take a LOT of committment and planning to efficiently utilize, and they deserve to be ranked alongside everyone else who had the same strategy at their disposal.
---
You're most welcome, hopefully more to come.
---
Oh you sweet summer child...
---
Yeah if you judge every class by how good they are at being a mage then why aren't you a mage?
---
Low effort. Was probably in loot window then you waited to loot after this.
---
This is beyond luck... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA x2  [https://imgur.com/a/4xZlyak](https://imgur.com/a/4xZlyak)
---
"market price 13g", twink gear is trash for another 6months.
---
38 with 2g here. :D
---
No it isn’t, if the mage is tailoring and needs it for bis.
---
BIS has +27 spellpower if you dont account for int and \~+21 if you do.
---
\+20/14 with the quest offhand.
---
Thats a shitton of difference :P
---
Can’t wait for this day
---
Apes is not a pve guild though
---
I'm curious to know this as well. Jokerd got like 3days and a couple hours if I recall correctly, I wonder what it would be if he only played on a rested account? Ignoring the obvious fact that he could no longer get an equivalent time, because he had to be ahead of the pack to farm in the places he did.
---
Don’t join the group. Make your own groups and watch everyone else get the loot you need.
---
you want to make getting UBRS much easier? Just get a key.
---
Because they made so many other changes and don't care about what you cried for?
---
Been 7/10 on that quest for a month now.
---
But how do you get good when every player you encounter is friendly?
---
Just what I was thinking. Nice files, yo!
---
I still have quests that I can do. EPL and Silithus are basically untouched. Scholo/Ubrs/Lbrs/Strat (If they have any) and all the Lvl 60 quests (At least questie showed me that there are quite a bit). I completed everything else if I'm not mistaken
---
I feel you bro. I'm rolling a warrior for the first time with my priest friend. We fully expected to heal and tank for all our dungeons. I'm always leader for inviting DPS and marking in dungeons. I will kick DPS for not doing their job, it is just too easy to replace them. 
---
On the AoE thing I've never had that issue but I'm still below LV 30. They're just trying to rush through because they spent 30 minutes or more looking for a tank or they're straight from retail where that's normal as far as I know. 
---
Tanking is rough but it's also the most interesting part of WoW (personal opinion)
---
Yes I corrected that. Keep in mind though that Human Warriors benefit far greater from BRE both in PvP and PvE.
---
As Sebastianthorson stated, you can kill Morphaz and Hazzas but you need to kill Jammal for the two others. I dont know how my friend found the youtube video for it, but basically just run up or kill your way to one of the mini bosses on the balconys and jump down in the middle. 
---
Here is a clip of one doing it!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9oikPJ\_qtI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9oikPJ_qtI)
---
i dont have a problem with tanking or being asked to tank but if they advertise for a dps then after I travel all the way to the instance I get the "Can you tank" it is a bit bullshit. And as I say its not that tanking is bad its that dps dont give you any time to get aggro or just open up on every different mob
---
It is intended to quest to level in WoW.  Always has.  This is in contrast to other MMOs at the time where you did grind (Lineage II, Ragnarok Online, Everquest, etc.)
---
Ye, Rogues are hardcountered by a Warrior if they cannot do the deadzone kiting. Can you link me the proof to that though? My mate said he can still do it.
---
Free transfers. Go to a pve server.
---
Grak'nak is my voidwalker's name.  I call him Greg... I figure grak'nak is Greg in demonic tounge.
---
It's called Bagnon, it's a handy all in one bag add-on that has several nifty features, like an auto sorter and the ability to view what's in your bank from anywhere
---
This is like the demo version of windfury weapon
---
They are correct with elvui. You need to enable all the pet bar items. If this doesn’t work, you can just make a make a /cast macro with name of the spell.
---
Wrong. It is intended to grind to level in WoW. The quests help you earn gold and explore the realm. They also show you where to find mobs around your level.  The grinding is how you level. 
---
Ever wonder why over half the quests are grinding quests?
---
If a quest mobs are camped every hour of the day, how in the fuck do you think you sitting around not killing mobs is optimal to killing random mobs while you wait? You can wait to do your quest if you want, but you are expected to grind mobs in the meantime.
---
Mages in classic seem to be what hunters were in vanilla.
---
I believe in you
---
Full during peak
---
Even for a mage that's stretching it.   
---
Assuming you have a job and need sleep. Which honestly we should.
---
Nearly every level past 30 has been taking me 6 to 8 hours. I've just been doing a ton of shit. I pvp a lot in the world, I go afk so I don't get logged out, all my professions(herb, skinning, and all 3 secondary) are above 250 now. I've been doing some pvp events with my guild. I fly around the world to do stupid one off quests because I want to "complete" some zones. Plus, I haven't even stepped into a dungeon since 40 and I'm 47 now. I have about 7 days played and I'll probably be close to 10 when I hit 60.
---
You're focused too much on getting levels than just having fun playing the game.
---
I fucking hate waiting for stone elemental spawns
---
So my pet bar is on what mobs can I test to make sure it’s working with
---
Now this makes sense to me, and I can certainly accept that it may have happened accidentally.
---
What’s it called?

Maybe this should serve as a reason to stop using dumbfuck generalizations.
---
Bye
---
Hm, maybe I can try being a lock that kills himself due to life tap spam. That sounds like a fun role.
---
Sucks to be so naive.
---
Now we're on the same page.
---
Yeah well the problem is they start spamming arcane explosion instead of blizzard so their burst is just retarded.
---
And if you don't have the rep, which you probably won't after finishing Mara, all the Timbermaws will try to kill you.
---
No way. I've been flying back to Ruth'eran since release..
---
Yes they have abilities. They appear on the pet bar. You can make them heal you, launch fireballs, give buffs etc.
---
What are you smokin?  A 2h Fury Warrior with Imp Slam would easily top the DPS charts with this weapon.
---
Good point, then spamming mind flay or downranked MB on Cooldown or something.
---
No, they do have down time if they’re playing their class correctly. Might want to learn to play lock a bit.
---
Yea I guess I can try. But running it as alliance is not as straightforward as it is for horde
---
Lmao everyone here drilling you but I think this is fucking hilarious.
---
It’s crazy I’ve ran it like, 10 times, seen each piece twice.
---
Alliance premades dominate, which is a lot of alliance bg groups, if my time in vanilla and some private servers has any credence, happened each time. 
---
Your premades go against mainly horde pugs and it becomes a FarmVille simulator. Horde premades could beat you but I was unlikely, being a great paladin is a lot easier than being a great shaman.
---
Horde got most of their honor from wpvp due to their queue times always being worse(horde likes to pvp more). They would farm ally in the world until their queue popped, also made it a LOT harder for horde to premake groups due to organizing 10+ people into the same battle group.
---
Whereas ally had no queue and could easily get everyone into the same bg.
---
With pugs I believe it goes wsg/av alliance win more and horde win ab more generally with water walking.
---
Hey you’re that guy that streamed Artifact
---
FYI healers aren't going to constantly waste their mana to heal you up after every pull
---
Holy nova prob stops being boost help around SM. At that point you will be drinking after every pull. It is mostly used in grps to clear out normal trash like rats in Strat, so caster dps doesn’t waste mana
---
That's the real question.
---
Kick and replace them then? It’s not really worth bringing a shadow priest because you have a healer with a bad attitude...
---
Read the text about the forsaken at the character creation screen. It’s been hinted at for a long time. But I don’t think this human could have known back then. Sylvanas started this path after the found out that she doesn’t want to truly die. So when she jumped off icecrown after Arthas' death. So imo they have just been hinted at being kind of evil and just use the horde for their advantage. There is still loyalty among some of the forsaken, as seen in the latest cinematic.
---
the bombs are really strong for pvp overall and will be really really useful when phase 2 is coming out. A dedicated pvp player will be also engi just to build those for his and his homies, so you've choosen the right profession
---
There's a regular FP as well you can use, however you need to have some of the adjacent FP's in order to use it.
---
We did it in 3,5 and half our raid was almost fresh 60
---
&gt;fury warrior
---
&gt;useless
---
Pick one
---
It skips a little bit of the front part of the dungeon, and you don't have to go  through the same long cave system before you get to the side entrance, its not really worth it IMO
---
And you have them both to orc females....
---
It's Prat
---
Searching for the quest is part of the game and discovering the world.
---
Now there are two of them!
---
Horde fp is just the the left when you come through the tunnel
---
A lot of people don't know about tricks like this. In some places, you can get considered in a different region just by being in the ocean. 
---
I was swimming half-way around Arathi from Menethil and was then considered in Hillsbrad, so I just drowned and spirit res'd at Southshore. 
---
You can also do this to swim from Menethil to Dun Morogh, and I also did it to swim from Theramore to Gadgetzan.
---
You skip the troggs at the beginning, the vikings, and Ironaya.
---
5 days right now. So hope so :D
---
Ye, I just plan to play on my Main Server for the next years probably.
---
You know you can turn off that GSYNC indication, right?
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
I wildly disagree. If you want to switch because it's fun and interesting then by all means, do that. But if your goal is to switch when it's a stronger spec,  I would wait until you have at least 6-9% +hit. 
---
2h arms sweeping strikes will STILL do more damage in dungeons all the way up to UBRS if played correctly though. 
---
At the end of the day, dual wield fury is a better single target spec and is best utilized in 20-40 man raid content.
---
Hm, why wouldn't you respec if you've been doing it 2+ days?
---
Do we have one of these bank alt guilds on Golemagg?
---
Mountain top
---
I love tanking, but hate dps pulling mobs, let me play my role, I decide the pace 😀
---
Lol... if only you knew. Now is the time to train new raiders. My guild just started its second raid team. We’re splitting the main raid team in half to help teach the second team. We’re all about setting new players up for success.
---
It’s so clever when people write that.  You must be a real creative guy.  Congrats!
---
I can read just fine.
---
I did it off and on over the last 2 days while doing dungeons/raids. Wasn't about to do dungeons/raids in pvp spec or respec multiple times a day. Id be at 50 gold rspecs, lol.
---
Do you really get BoA for free when hitting lvl 60?
---
&gt;In a classic disingenuous move, he compares Mythic Azshara to freakin Ragefire Chasm to conclude that "Classic isn't hard". By that, he hisses the point by a mile
---
There is a world of difference between showing footage related to a subject and making a direct comparison using visual cues, distinguishing between the two is something you should have had a solid grasp on before you made it to high school.
---
Considering your claimed distaste for big words I'll be optimistic and just assume you misunderstood the video rather than considering you pulling a classic disingenuous move.
---
&gt;Does mean disliking quest markers and quest compasses in Elder Scrolls that you are a traditionalist nostalgist? No, it means that you want to play an immersive RPG instead of a railroaded, hand-holding FPS experience.
---
The bulk of the conclusion talks postively on behalf of the unguided experience, did you watch to the end of the video? And why are you badmouthing FPS games for literally no reason?
---
Never thought to use him there that’s clever!
---
I just always used succ for the cc in sm, or imp if we were aoeing
---
Nah, just a warlock a mage and rogue alts in every Inn. Almost how transportation service guild operates. You can summon any bank alt to any Inn, then they can hearthstone to Orgri or Ironforge.
---
It only goes to Felwood and Winterspring, right? Kinda useless before you can accesse these particular zones.
---
Is she doing backflips?
---
&gt;what other option do I have?
---
Look at the picture that started this thread.
---
Those are people I would avoid like hell come phase 2.
---
I've encountered many warriors who didn't use Berserker Rage
---
“But he’s charging the dungeon group for water”
---
“Close the gate!”
---
You have some issues.  Enjoy your time out from the game that you will invariably receive.
---
I love the versatility of a shaman. I can heal/dps in dungeons. I also have totems that can cleanse people or take aggro. I usually have an answer to many situations. 
---
I do enjoy the utility over a straight DPS style of a hunter.
---
Official blizzard responses:
---
Q: Will PAID transfers also be a thing should a server drop heavily in population and a player wishes to move to find more activity or reconvene with friends on another server.
---
A: We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We'll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm. We believe realm identity is an important aspect of Classic so any guidelines around transfers should support this belief.
---
Q:Will there be paid services for Classic?
---
A: We aren't considering other services beyond character transfer at this time.
---
And I’m sure that this happens, this bigger problem is the market manipulation side that effects people who don’t go and camp there
---
"Regards, Fishstack". Lmao
---
No, a new raid isn’t releasing in P2 from what I remember. Just the honor system
---
A friend is NicholasRage a warrior.
---
thank you, I haven't tried farming it yet, and wanted to get some clarification beforehand
---
This is adorable and I fully endorse this.
---
So is a slam based 2h fury build not viable at all?
---
Is it not quite good as a rage dump?
---
Why are you using player created channels that can be taken over when there's a perfectly fine channel called LookingForGroup built in to the game?
---
you are wrong from the get go\^\^ , Ambush opener? you deserve to die !
---
There is only one way, stun lock the warlock,  he should never get out of stun, use blind if you miss once and gouge, kick every thing, do duels, learn or reroll
---
my 2 cents :)
---
I'm curious about this too, i feel like tribal is the 'best' option for me as a rogue, but then it also feels like the option that every other rogue chooses. Wondering what options elemental LW provides to sway me before i make my decision!
---
Well I'm a stealth class, but can confirm. Everytime I try to do quests some mage or a group of horde buddies show up to fk me up..
---
I manage to escape a lot in travel, but still, cant get much quests done so I just dungeon-mode it more often than not.
---
Yo same
---
I don't have enough time right now for multi hour instances which can be the case with some of these later dungeons :(
---
Absolutely, but you'd be surprised at how many druids don't even know about the FP and take the direct flights to TB/Darnassus. For horde it's extremely worthwhile to corpserun to boodvenom post early on, lots of time can be saved by teleporting to moonglade and flying to wherever you want.
---
For non-druids it's not really worthwhile until the later levels, but it should save some time you'd otherwise spend on a wonky route.
---
Tell him you’ve noticed the profit margin increases and the overall net gain of his performance, but that times are tight right now and there’s no money for advancement. 
---
But you should throw a guild party for how well the guild has done!
---
There are several quests where the forsaken do evil/shady things, I find it pretty interesting to play through as a non-undead and be like: "Should the Warchief know about that?"
---
Also there is a quest in Thunderbluff that is not available for Undead that tells you to grab a book from Scarlet Monastery about the origin of the undead and how they can be unmade.
---
So there has always been tension between the Forsaken und the rest of the Horde.
---
You start fights with more rage, and you have access to more of your abilities on demand. One part of arms tanking in mid levels is charge&gt;sweeping strikes&gt;zerk+weaponswap to 2h&gt;whirlwind&gt;defensive stance+weaponswap to sword and board. 
---
There are a ton of stance dance combos that you need Tac Mastery for.
---
There is no channel named “world” it was created by someone. The most recent person to have moderator of the channel, if they dc then it is passed to someone else so that the channel can be moderated while those people aren’t online. Notice that “world” isn’t capitalized? It’s a created channel.
---
Completely normal, and had nothing to do with your friends/group members dc. 
---
If you want to make a chat channel you can easily do so just type /join “channel name” (no quotes needed there) and it will add you to that channel, if it doesn’t exist, it will be created and then you will be added to it.
---
You must be new here. Those were all over this subreddit literally every day. The front page. Im not quite sure where you see me whining(or basing anything on “wrong info” given all these things did in fact happen), I’m merely pointing out that people have been wrong quite a bit so far. Also not arguing about what is or isn’t “optimal.” Many kicked and screamed to the moon that if you didn’t play something optimal, you were literally wasting your time and wouldn’t be able to raid. Which has been totally untrue up to this point.
---
As others said aoe farming is kind of just about having lots of int. Blizzard scales only a tiny bit from spell power, so it's better to just be able to cast lore of them. 6k mana or more you'd want. Every extra bit of mana is one more blizzard, or one more frost Nova and cone of cold combo, or squeezing out that last arcane explosion etc... 
---
For a bit of spell power you can get stuff like the spell power vs undead trinket from the Strat quest chain, where you collect zombie meat then right click stuff in the ziggies.
---
Have the aoe spec that includes having ice shards and shatter, for the crit and bonus crit damage so you can use frost Nova and cone of cold as a finisher while still having 5 pts in clear casting. Just don't get frostbite obv.
---
It was rolled for. I was in a group of four friends. They either passed or rolled greed, and I needed it.
---
Blizzard won't do shit. Streamers have special privileges, and they know it
---
That escalated quickly
---
You can farm the giants and reset instance without killing bosses.  They have a super low chance at sulfuron ingots.
---
Front flips. They do it for hemo and evis for rogues as well. Looks like sunder for warriors. It's very satisfying to play
---
90/10 more so lol nah but I would figure a good 65-35
---
Just got to 20 on my hunter and currently dual wielding daggers, but mainly just use how. I basically just have them for the agility bonuses. I’ve heard people talk about slow 2h being better but most of them I see have prices based on doing melee damage or it has worse bonus stats than my current daggers. Is the bonuses what I should be going for since I use bow mainly while pet tanks?
---
I don't remember heirloom items costing so much.
---
I would gladly pay 4s to not have to click on the flightmaster and choose the next target.
---
Figured that's why, was just curious :)
---
Another factoid, factoid originally meant a piece of trivia that sounds correct but is false. Lots of pedants try to "correct" people using like you have, but the truth is language is mutable and the definition has just shifted to become basically a small piece of trivia.
---
I'm trying to grasp the context of someone cosplaying a  LotR elf with an AR and it's kind of boggling my mind.
---
Noep, you forgot one.
---
I assumed it was other programmers saying Blame UX.
---
Not worth it, 5% crit with axes in arms would be better
---
We definitely had a few beverages as well! Now we are having an “Officer Meeting” at a nearby Coney Island
---
those posts all suck lol
---
Reddit had a damn near heart attack over it, daily. Plenty of people certainly said it was bullshit, but it existed quite a bit.
---
There's also a place in the barrens that will take you to Westfall
---
Well, yes. Did anyone argue that point? You've pivoted to a completely different statement. Your aim is to maximise your DPS whilst engaging in the boss mechanics. But that wasn't your original point, where you said DPS shouldn't care about more DPS. You made no mention of DPS ignoring mechanics to do so. You're strawmanning.
---
I value agility and strength almost equally as a druid, but if I have the choice agility is probably a hare better overall
---
Yeah I've done this a fair bit but only when pulling multiple mobs by accident. Thanks
---
Correct
---
That is not possible unfortunately. Blizzard provides a default bar, form bars and additional action bars. Only the default bar and form bars will ever switch when you switch forms. That is the standard regardless of using ElvUI or the standard Blizzard UI. All other action bars will remain the same and never switch when your form changes.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Cool. Don't join those groups then. Problem solved.
---
Noone can ever type my name, you could!
---
Sorry what do you mean by the dead zone? The area where I'm too close to shoot?
---
We have two eyes in our guild now too. But we won’t build it because it’s useless for raids. Congratulations on ur wepon but I have the feeling the drops are scuffed. We already have 2x the first binding too?
---
You're better off asking this question in r/WowUI is probably the best.
---
However, I don't think Shadowed Unit Frames or Bartender directly affect the tooltips other then manipulating frames of where a mouseover tooltip would be.
---
This is why you should look into a separate tooltip addon.
---
you right, its all about being lazy.
---
its not that it actually takes 5+ minutes of straight casting and drinking to make the water lul
---
lets say your a fresh level 40 mage; rank 5 conjure water costs 420 mana per cast. at lvl 40 (when you get the spell) it only gives 2 water per cast with a cast time of 3 seconds per. 
---
meaning to give someone a single stack it costs 4200 mana and take 30 seconds of cast time. most mages at that level have between 3300 and 4400 mana. so they MIGHT be able to make a single stack but then they have to drink, which adds another 50~ seconds (that water in particular only regens 1992 mana per 30 seconds)
---
so for 1 stack of water the level for mage has taken about 80 seconds. now imagine, he has to make it for himself, the priest then another caster.
---
even if he only has to worry about the priest, it would take 8 minutes to give himself and the priest 3 stacks of water each. (which is the standard amount most will say you are supposed to give out at a minimum)
---
now ask yourself, would you like too wait 8minutes at the start of a dungeon or would you rather he just give the priest the cheap shit and move on
---
edit: and to add on top of that, generally speaking most of us are using the earlier water too at lvl 30/40/50 because we dont want to slow the group down too much. that shit adds up
---
No, if it had been looted, the chat prompt would say "You received loot: [Pattern]."
---
This is showing the pre-roll prompt, announcing what the party is about to roll for, such as in this screenshot 
---
https://i.redd.it/4140k0ri0xq31.jpg
---
As you can see, on top of the chat window, it says Loot [staff of jordan] just like the pattern of OP, this is pre-loot, when he opened the mobs loot window.
---
I play a boomy actually in classic (right now on lvl 58) - and i'm competing with mages often in the dps meter, also on my level - but people act really suprised when they see me in a dungeon group or while leveling :D its nice that people are celebrating that I'm playing Boomy :p
---
Level 21 mage here. What items am I looking for in the deadmines? I just ran my first one yesterday and had a lot of fun. Should I run it a bunch more times?
---
You sound like very nice, people will surely accept your ideas if you are nice as you are to them. /s
---
Reported and blocked, be civil, it’s a sub rule.
---
Seriously tho. I *need* to know this.  Did you guys coordinate the plad or was this just coincidence?
---
Silithus basically has nothing right now anyway. I think just one or two quests. Most of it gets revamped later on to prep for AQ, so maybe we see some of that in phase 4 at the earliest.
---
My pally is Hearthledger!
---
This was the fastest reply I’ve ever seen. Haha. I literally pressed post and got a notification that I had a comment before the page even transitioned back after posting. Lol.
---
You wasnt paying attention, I better have an honest talk with You.
---
I did that death run 15 years ago and even once more a few weeks ago just for old time's sake. I've done it before and don't need to do it again, but I respect your commitment.
---
My questie is also bugging me with "hey you got a quest here" and I show up, nope, not in this phase.
---
This reminds me of flying Delta, except backwards. 
---
Want to fly from IND to MSP? $616

Want to fly from IND to DEN thru MSP? $427

That's when I turn 360 degrees and walk away
---
What type of character changes were in Vanilla?
---
Shieeet that's the name of my old guild on EU Bloodscalp during vanilla.
---
This depends entirely on your race.  If you're a human or an orc, then no, you won't need them.  If you're a different race, then Edgemaster's are your best in slot gloves for generating threat until you get The Hungering Cold off Kel'Thuzad.
---
Weapon skill is pretty enormous for warriors: the first 5 points of weapons kill reduce your hit cap from 9% down to 6% against level 63 mobs (such as all raid bosses) and increase your total damage done by ~10% by lowering both the chance and penalties of glancing blows.  This means that the first 5 points of weapon skill equate to 3% hit and +10% overall damage.  Simply put, if you're having threat issues (and every raid tank has threat issues), 5 points of weapon skill are your most valuable stats in the game.
---
Now, Edgemaster's are a pretty bad pair of gloves for defense, so any time you're tanking a boss that you'll be tanking off to the side alone for a while (like Sulfuron Harbinger, Luciferon, or Gehennas), you'd rather have defensive gloves equipped because you'll have time to build a strong threat foundation on your target before the dps move to it and start blowing it up.
---
The plaid was coordinated! We had a “Hoedown” themed party
---
Yes, if you want to try a PvP server you should. You still have time to get to 60 before phase 3 so you aren’t really missing out on anything by rerolling
---
Slower weapon speed is better in WOW when you have another ability that is based on weapon damage. Eg warriors have an instant attack called Mortal Strike and it’s damage is calculated from base weapon damage. If you have two 50 DPS axes, and one is 50 damage with 1.0 second speed the special attack Mortal Strike will deal less damage than the axe with 100 damage with 2.0 second speed. 
---
Slower speed could also be better in certain pvp situations if you are “jousting”. You are able to hop in and out of melee range for another melee class so they can’t hit you with some of their attacks, but you can still make powerful damaging attacks at slower speed. This was a big tactic in EQ pvp. A lot of WOW pvp favors hugging your melee opponent closely since there’s a number of other abilities you want to fire off.
---
Faster weapon speed can be better for a couple reasons too! When attacking something that’s casting a spell you can delay the cast by hitting it more times. Or you have certain talents like a warriors in Fury tree where you get an extra rage point every time your weapon hits.
---
Apart from skills that depend on weapon speed, it doesn’t particularly matter, what matters most is damage per second. 
---
I’ll leave the “what the notation convention” should be up to the philosophers :)

Actually it's a good way to determine his ability to interact with people. 
---
Not all people display anxiety and social issues the same as another. 
---
If he has no problem posting on Reddit maybe he can try to make connections with people through forums and discord etc etc before he plays with them to relieve the anxiety.
---
Understanding your triggers is a important piece of dealing with anxiety and learning to work with it.
---
Yeah but... this goes to 11.
---
Cool, is this a copypasta now?
---
Probably ganking Alliance lowies...
---
What people are saying is that if you ONLY do quests there's not enough xp to get to 60. You probably mixed in some dungeons even if you didn't "farm" them
---
I’m about to hit 40- what dungeons have you been grinding latent?
---
Yeah, about 2 expansions longer.
---
It's classic, you chose to play the only class that can tank at endgame...
---
Till omen comes to town.

Then it's a free for all

You get rested XP as a ghost
---
There is honestly not much to master in relation to other games.  You don't need to be friend with everyone and if you ask things try the general chat the patient ones will whisper you. 
---
Good luck overcoming your already identified weakness that's a good goal.  
---
May be consider choosing a character easily underestimated.  Gnomes or trolls preferably females (sad here but it still imprinted in too many).  That way people won't expect you to be fast or skilled unless you show it. 
---
From my experience beeing just kind is a key to make friends. Some will be in a rush let them go others take things easy and don't hurry stick with them. 
---
All the best!
---
I use ElvUI but maybe your UI has something similar. I also wanted to change the location of the tooltip. In ElvUI’s settings/options box, there’s a button called “toggle anchors” which turns your screen into a grid with boxes. I found the box labeled tooltip and permanently moved it’s location that way. I hope this helps

I mean at some companies that translate to COO which is pretty nice.
---
I kill via hypothermia. I do not accept this argument.
---
I think it’s bugged. We know multiple guilds with both bindings. Our guild got two eyes (we won’t build it) and two times first binding. Something is wrong
---
How and where do I learn PVP? I’m getting my butt kicked and I would love to change that.
---
What server ?!   I’d love to join!
---
Wow... 70g is dirt cheap. I just Paid 200g on whitemane and it was a great deal in our economy. I would personally do it if you're orc but probably wouldn't use it until late 50s or 60
---
Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals
---
Exactly, if you want to you can easy find people to group up with even at level 1. But at higher levels you kind of are forced to if you wanna complete some quests/ dungeons for example! Give the game a try, dont think you will regret it, especially since you seem like a social driven person!
---
What's the difference between horde and alliance regarding 1h/2h? I've seen this before, even the 2h Fury spec guide says alliance and horde put points differently.
---
Cause otherwise some special snowflakes reply #NotAll to me as if that would be an actual argument?
---
That quest gives a great pvp trinket, I think it's a 40% movement speed boost on use.
---
Edit: 40% not 30%
---
The rag model is fire
---
Jesus your comment history, lmao.  Racism and salt all day every day - a shining beacon of the Alliance.
---
Also given how often you throw around virgin I'm guessing that's some serious projection going on hahaha.
---

---
Yea it’s very weird. So many legeendaries already
---
You. I like you.
---
Truth. I grinded tigresses in the Badlands from 37-41 never touched an elemental lol
---
That’s a bit unfair to the Tauren.  InFlight pegs the free Moonglade—&gt; Thunderbluff at 9:03 flight time.
---
Once 2nd phase releases and the rank 14 system with it the only way to increase your PvP rank will be through open-world PvP so it will make normal leveling a fuck ton harder. That's why if you are thinking about leveling another character you should do it as soon as possible and you can always lvl up the PvE guy later... Of course, do whatever you want.
---
Yes, it was like this in vanilla as well, I used to farm it.
---
Yep manually. I’ve got two accounts I’m doing checks all the time because it concerned me when I realized every single time I go to BRM there’s 30 alliance and never one single horde. So I just manually count lol
---
Please check my comment. I clearly stated "levelling lock". Nice word waste though
---
Ah. Ty for clarifying. Was gonna say.... what were the cosmic chances.... ehehhe
---
I imagine cutting it into wedges like a watermelon
---
It's more that there are far, far more people per server raiding MC.
---
Let them die a few times and they will figure it out.  As you get to higher level stuff the time it takes for them to kill a dps that pulled aggro is less and less.  So that sort of thing should be happening less as well.
---
They expect it to be like retail where you apparently quest and use LFG and never leave cities.
---
The hypocrisy in this comment deserves a gold medal.
---
Turn off channel invites in settings, case closed.

Who invites you channels ever besides gold farmers? No one, stop complaining.

Uhh Theramore Pale Ale?
---
To be more accurate the Horde as a whole is divided between Sylvanas Loyalists and those opposed to her. Although a majority of her Loyalists are Forsaken, there is more then a few forsaken starting to question whether or not to follow Sylvanas. 
---
This was highlighted very well in Before the Storm  but re-introduced in the latest cinematic. After all the person who represented the Horde losing faith in Sylvanas after she said very publicly that the Horde was nothing was a Forsaken. 
---
As for what the human was talking about... it was the plague. The starting zones for Forsaken revolve around them developing the Plague in secret from the rest of the Horde. That plotline wraps up in WotLk.
---
Should be called backup arrived
---
i feel bad saying it but the hammer isn't BiS in PvE or farming content and is more niche in PvP to do that WF fireball mega death attack. so the hammer ends up being pure status so a smart guild will infact sell the ingots as gearing wise we have the time to gear the entire raid without getting hammers for BWL.
---
PM me your secrets senpai
---
&gt;I also find that the Horde are much more likely to let you finish a quest turn in before they kill you.
---
Anecdotal, but yesterday I was doing the Kodo turn-in quest in Desolace when a mage about 3 levels below me just started polying me and another guy that was doing the quest. Couldn't do much about it until he failed a poly on me and I killed him. I go on my way doing the quest and he shows up again and tried to poly me again, so I cast silence on him and killed him again. Then he got 4-5 people from his guild to corpse camp me and the other guy doing the quest until finally some high level alliance came and killed them all.
---
Got my boots though, so it's fine.
---
Well hello there my fellow incendius bois
---
There are no encounters where your pet can't dps. On baron geddon you have to send your pet out with the rest of the melee doing the aoe of course, but that's about it.
---
And yes you are correct, claw+bite and the extra dps is why cats are superior. It more than makes up for wind serpents range attacks and the wolf party buff.
---
The "of the Tiger" stuff is really all you can do. IMO go bear to get BIS items as you dont lose that much dmg being tank spec. That's what I did. I need 2 items now to be BIS
---
What levels should tank/DPS/heals be for BRD lava/emperor only runs?
---
Brd pick pocketing is like 40+ gp/h especially if you can kill loregrain/plugger this is meh??
---
who the fuck cares about weapon skill on this weapon?
---
oh reeeeeally. 
---
I would like to know more.
---
I've spent a ton of time in BRD this last week, if I defined the entrance I would say it's contested.  I've helped control it, been routed, cleared horde back out, it's great and the balance feels spot on.
---
At what level should I start aoe leveling with mage and where (gnome mage)
---
I’m not sure if we should believe this person. This sounds like a piece of trivia that sounds correct but is false. Hmm...
---
To me there is enough PVP in BGs and Arena when that stuff opens up.  Most world PvP I found to be pointless.
---
U can. My wife play night elf and I have undead warlock and troll mage westfall server same account.
---
Nope, but you could run it again to get the Staff of Westfall if you haven't. You also get a good frost staff in wetlands tho. 
---
Low instances as a mage do it only for quest experience since your class is not gear dependent
---
I was so mad when I found that out. Like why!!
---
In hopes that someone will know the answer I leave this comment.
---

---
Stop censoring their names.
---
I think it's also a lot faster to take the boat to theramore and jump off than swim all the way to dun morogh coast, since the boat passes right by it anyway.
---
Wetlands is lower lvl compare to hillsbrad
---
What interface add-ons are you using? That looks amazing
---
It is possible using the action paging. 
---
 I do this on Bar 5, my NAGA bar.  For me, the following worked, modified from bar 1 settings
---
[Bonusbar:1] 3; [bonusbar:2] 9;
---
If you play it perfectly it's probably on par or even slightly better than Hamstring spam but in practice the gameplay is too clunky because it's a melee attack with a cast time and the mob can easily move out of range for a variety of reasons. It also suffers from cast time pushback due to damage received and the fact that you need to watch the swing timer very carefully as well doesn't help.
---

Doing this in combat spec brings me 35-40 an hour because of longer vanish cooldowns from when resisted.

Bruh its been answered, that quest gives the nifty stopwatch trinket- it has nothing to do with a retail mindset.

We have run that dungeon over 100 times and still haven't seen that dagger.

Still can ignore them too but SMM is pretty annoying lol.

Yep. We got two complete sets of Warglaives from BT within ~4 months (I think), but we never saw a Bulwark *ever*. And we cleared that place every week until the next expansion.

Mocking costs 10 rage. If you swap stances without Tactical mastery, you won't be able to use it imediately.
---
Funny thing, I’m listening to Kungen’s stream while leveling. Probably the most famous tank of all time. Even he hates mages. He said “ban all mages” and that they always fuck with his aggro, frost nova ruins his tanking. Deal with it, mages. You are the scum of WoW.
---
You go to main menu (escape), system, graphics
---
Searing gorge and burning steppes flight points ruin auto pathing for you as alli. 15s to the cost of everything instead of 50c going through SW. Also all flights out of burning steppes are at least 7s except redridge which is 2s and therefore better to stop in every time.
---
My point has nothing to do with ninjaing. 
---
BoE's have equal value to every player there is no reason to give anyone priority over them. Hell if you think long about it, you will realize that the person who can use the BoE as an upgrade, is ironically the person who gets the LEAST value from that item. But I won't spoil why.
---
1 mob per day is perhaps a bit too extreme
---
I believe quests were added in as patches were rolled out, and on top of that, not everyone knew where all the quests were back then. There weren't addons immediately available out of the gate.
---
You're trying to look like the smart one here, but you're not succeeding. 2H Fury refers to a Fury build that revolves around swinging a single 2 Hander.
---
The mage was about to kill the VW anyway, once I did it though he ran off 🤷‍♂️
---
The urukhai would have been royally screwed lol

That’s makes sense, I think I’ll make the switch soon (level 55 atm).

Ambush blind. Wait to go out of combat or vanish. Ambush again

I just looted [Badhguuder](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13204) in LBRS, and one group member said it's the BIS weapon and their MT is trying to get it for weeks. How does the armor shred compares to other stats like stamina and strength and is it better than Mirah's Song? Because that's the BIS weapon on every BIS list.
---
Edit: LBRS not UBRS
---
Chances are most of the resources came from layer exploits so no biggie, I’m sure they have plenty
---
ye hilarious. we can print money
---
but also 5+ people spam us per few minutes asking for shit, im not a fast food resturant D:

[Laughs in Wailing Caverns]
---
Lol 2H fury is a DPS spec in classic, does not dual wield. Just a single 2 hander.
---
&gt; Are you forgetting that there are classes that use 2Handers in PvE?
---
Nah, he's remembering all the other weapons these classes would rather use.
---
the barrens is also the easiest level 10-20 zone for any faction to get to, if it was contested, alliance would never stop griefing there. The reason Loch, westfall and darkshore are all contested is because there is no reason for horde to go there unless A. Traveling or B. killing low levels
---
[Live to Win plays]
---
The way it works is blizzard tooltip says it does x damage over 10 seconds or whatever. So 12 spell damage only adds to the total damage not the per tick. So it only ends up being a couple damage per person tick.
---
No idea if they were there before diremaul came out, but it's no big deal.

Like other person said, there is an entirely separate ground clutter slider. I have half settings below max and 10 ground clutter

Wowhead recently released a [pet talent calculator](https://classic.wowhead.com/hunter-pet-training) that might help you figure out what you'd like to do points wise.
---
Personally, I like armor before stam as it *should* be more survivable than just adding straight health, though there's probably an optimal setup that maximizes survivability per point spent.
---
Resistances should be set to whatever you're fighting, though I just do a moderate amount of each of the more common damage types for my non raid pet.
---
Things like claw are usually a trap and an excellent way to ensure your pet never has enough focus for other more important abilities, though still has its uses. Just don't leave it on all the time.
---
Not really many good spellpower pieces at lower levels. Imo go for stam+int. Try to get Hypnotic Blade from SM lib, it will last to 60. And always use a Shield.
---
Wait you don’t like it here as alliance? Have you been here since the last transfers opened? Trust me it isn’t the same realm it was two weeks ago. Two weeks ago it was a dead server with a population of about 3000 keeping us low. Now we’re swamped. I hate it here as horde and I’m paying to leave once they open the transfers up. Blizz could have prevented this stuff by only allowing free transfers for the faction that wasn’t overly dominate
---
It’s only this bad on this subreddit. Or at least it isn’t this bad on Pagle. I have had exactly zero terrible runs as of 57, almost 58.

Wait. I just reread your post. 
---
Well, I stand by what I said. It’s only this bad on the subreddit. I’m glad you’re here.
---
*cries in Stalaag*

This example is downright untrue. It is a fact that the devs spent roughly double the amount of time working on the 1-30 Alliance zones, and much of kalimdor is rushed/unfinished.
---
They probably drop bits into their mouth
---
Gnolls almost destroyed the kingdom of stormwind my dude. They are at war with the alliance.
---
Murlocs are hostile raiders that attack everyone on sight and end up worshiping Naga/demons half the time.

Quilboar also attack everyone on sight and are at war with Tauren and orcs.

I use auctioneer as well but its wayyyyyy off. Says I'll get 6s and I get 2 powders worth 99c each. It's confusing me and seems I'm losing money not gaining. If it says it's worth 6s do I have to be like max level ench or no matter if I'm lvl 5 or lvl 200 I have the same chance to get 6s worth?
---
thats fairly bad, but still not as bad as being damn near begged for portals and food/water.
---
you have the 1 thing people ask you for. mages have 3 AND we are far more likely to be msgd. they msg you if they cant find a mage too portal em to sw/If. were the first asshats they msg.

Yep it was fun for awhile. we had a pop equal to a real vanilla realm. Now it’s fucking hell. I feel so bad for my guildies trying to level in STV and such. It’s just impossible for them.
---
I’ve noticed that the Europeans are so much more into roleplaying their characters and putting out quality content. Wish I can say the same for Americans.
---
Are there automated auction sniper tools out there? Last night I accidentally posted an auction for a green item for less than vendor cost and half a second after I posted it was sold. It's possible somebody happened to see it right when I posted but I swear it was pretty much instantaneous.
---
From what I know, morgraine has the best balance between high pop and faction balance.
---
If you want super high pop and less balance(about 40-60 horde favored), gehennas is by far the best pvp server.
---
Pvp realms are a little bit better: half the competition when your side is winning
---
I just got my epic mount and so my main goal is to get Benediction. I was worried about the quest because I heard about a 2hour respawn timer if you fail.
---
Did you just use holy nova or the grenades to take care of the adds that spawn? Also grats! Such a sick staff. I’m not jealous at all.
---
Don't hold off for too long! Many players are absolutely willing to take a few extra minutes on a quest or in a dungeon group to explain an encounter! I play as a tank (often seen as the defacto leader of dungeon groups), and I regularly take a minute to check with in with other group members if I don't know an encounter. It saves us all time...this isn't Fortnite, more often than not people are willing to give you tips! Maybe start by asking to group up with another player clearly doing the same quest as you...it is way more common in classic for folks to join up. Check your quest log to see if there is a number next to the quest to know if your party member shares any other quests and it can lead to an hour or two of questing together!
---
It's called Twitter.

What quest is this called!?
---
I saw a LanaDelPray priest yesterday lol
---
Exactly the opposite. Would have mained a Warrior, but knew the environment would make me give up on tanking so I didn't bother.
---
I've been playing a mage since Vanilla and here's my take on it: If you need food and water say something, or just open trade and I'll happily give you as much as you want. That's how it's always been since vanilla with pretty much every mage I've ever met. When I enter a dungeon (or when I'm on the way there) I usually start conjuring enough water and food for every single member of the party, but I don't randomly start trading people shit that they may not even want or need. And you know what? Nobody's ever had any problem with that whatsoever. Not a single person in 15 years (give or take) of playing a Mage. If you're really that fucking entitled that you honestly think it's a mage's responsibility to shove food and water up your arsehole without you indicating in any way, shape or form that you want or need some, then I don't know what to tell you man.  
---
What's next, am I supposed to have an excel spreadsheet open during dungeons so I can keep track of how much water you have left, so you don't have to communicate with me at all when you're about to run out?  
---
You know what I do when I want a Health Stone? I tell the WL that I'd like one. Done. Takes about 5 seconds to type it out. Never once in my wow career did I think "That WL sucks because he can't even read my mind to figure out I'd like an HS." But then again I'm not an imbecile.  
---
I know it's in style to shit on mages now but this is getting ridiculous guys.
---
I actually think this is how it used to be and I haven't found an option to change it yet.
---
i'm the gm of the guild &lt;Dungeon Dynamite&gt; andonce a guy got a mental breakdown in guildchat, ever since people keep leaving the guild without a reason whatsoever and I get no mail. (the mental dude is long gone tho) Idk just... I just envy you I guess  ^^

That’s how everyone should do it.  Then if you want to give it away just trade it.  All of these people who don’t understand why it has to be this way have not played long enough apparently

Mage - "Hey can I get Fort?"
---
me - "sure" *give fort and spirit buff"
---
mage - “... "
---
me -" can I get int pls"
---
mage "costs too much mana" 
---
me "lmao I gave you 2 buffs and you make free water"
---
mage "my inventory is full so I can't make water" 
---
me "notice how I buffed you and my mana bar is already back full? strange huh?" 
---
mage "I'll fubar your ass if you don't shut up" 
---
he then proceeded to try and steal a quest mob tag from me for 5 mins
---
What race are you? That’s one of the most coveted items to find. If you’re wanting to tank though always sell. They’re useless for tanking. But if you’re hoping to DPS and you’re not orc or human then save them. Orc and human never use them though. They’re also worth a crap load of gold so congrats.

I had a ton of fun the other night. I went on my 25 hunter to ashenvale and mowed down horde all night. Probably killed about 20 toons and only had to stop when ?? levels started showing up to kill me.
---
Whether you agree or not, the reason was having to manually look for groups was because it promoted community and and having to actually care about your reputation, both things LFG tools/addons helped to kill.
---
Not for Rag.
---
I feel like a smart guild would do more things like this(this thread) to attract more Hardcore players to join. They will make the gold without selling ingots and they’re getting publicity this way, which helps guilds like this more than a couple thousand gold.
---
I'm about to hit level 60, but I haven't even begun to do any of the Western/Eastern Plaguelands quests yet. Should I do them when I hit max level for the gold and quest rewards?
---
\*Zug Zug noises\*
---
What frames are those for party members?
---
Yeah the Alliance on Whitemane are huge assholes.
---
Remember in classic people will only believe you if you take a picture of it!
---
Hey, this almost worked but it doesn't do one thing.
---
It doesn't equip shield and 1h when I go from berserker stance to defensive
---
Consider myself as a casual (sub 20h/week) and will ding 40 today. Also all my profession are 225+ and have just enough g for my mount
---
I am not the one that claims random bullshit and then moves the goal post.
---
I mean it was a full guild run and I play warrior. It didn't actually matter to me lol
---
I forgot random respecs because you wanna try out something different.
---
The two things that bother me the most are the fact that horde-side you get an easy quest for that nice +25 fishing skillNat Pagle fishing pole (alliance has no similar quest) and they get a teleporter to Gnomeregan (alliance has to trek right past UC to get to SM). I can deal with the trek to SM but that fishing pole quest is bullshit. Oh, and bonus, since alliance doesn't have that easy fishing pole quest the next best pole we can get is a ~0.1% drop from shellfish traps underwater **right outside a horde base**. Why does Blizzard hate alliance fishermen?
---
So for a (dwarf) hunter, slow speed is better than fast right? I got both the gun from mara and the bow from the quest. Same dps but the bow is slower with about 40 more top end damage. Which one should I be using?
---
I hit level 27 yesterday, and completed the DeadMines dungeon! Got my first blue piece of gear, hit 10g (before spending it on training) too
---
How do you turn using your mouse?
---
Try to watch PVP videos (Vikturus, Swifty, Laintime) and try to analize what they're doing and why ! 
---
You can also spend hours dueling people outside OG/IF ;)
---
because it's not extra effort. for many people it is easier. why do you care so much? it's a picture of loot. better quality wouldn't add anything
---
Not from the target frame
---
realm?
---
Yeah I was up at 7 am the other day thinking I could have it to myself, nope, four other people.
---
For every cool world pvp story I see, I hear several more about being corpse camped, griefed, cheese ganked etc
---

---
&gt; There's a reason tanks are hard to come by, why so many people are constantly spamming 'LF Tank last spot'
---
Yes, its because there's only 1 tank class and 75% of them are too big primadonnas to actually tank.
---
What can’t you draw :o this is beautiful (please no more crying peons. I’ve cried enough)
---
I believe you should be finding gear that gives straight up +% to crit and hit chance.
---
I read that there’s a set of leather gloves that gives +6 stam and +1% to crit chance, which are supposed to be BIS prior to Devilsaur. Also there is The Rockpounder from Uldaman which gives +6 str and +2% to crit chance. 
---
Those are the items I am currently grinding for on my druid. Most of my other gear is also STR/AGIL.
---
I should be sitting at about 25% crit chance when I get The Rockpounder and LoTP 3% buff, at around level 45.
---
How long does it usually take to find a group at higher levels?
---
Make sure you got time to adjust the UI after installing it, because you might not like everything that is going to be changed. You will get a complete new layout as a base for the start
---
Because it dropped.
---
Agreed, but it's always a question of availablility and most of us aren't going competitive. So there will be a spot for everyone I believe in most non optimized scenarios.
---
I’m undead, thank for the help
---
Its about as good as the mage clips with a poly and then frost nova arcane etc blowing all spells.
---
Oh shit those things are like 40 levels apart, you're totally right
---
I get about 6 of these an hour, sometimes more on a good night. All different characters sending them too.
---
the vast majority of players aren't even aware of the 5 second rule let alone water walking
---
&gt; Why should I give little timmy eye of divinity over a priest who was at every raid and is significantly better at healing than he is?
---
You just answered yourself 
---
&gt;We’re all about setting new players up for success.
---
Communists take money froM everyone.
---
Time to pick up a sport or gym membership
---
Posting single herbs on the auction house and taking a picture of your screen?
---
Jesus Christ man, you have a lot of stuff to figure out.
---
I love tanking. Im the captain now.
---
It's kind of weird. Especially since a couple of really popular streamers got drops really early on. I feel like it'd be too enticing for Blizz to not tamper with. Builds hype.
---
Those better be stacks of at least 10.
---
Make sure you get Wolfshead helm. It's very useful for speeding up questing a bit. I typically wear it then switch to my tank helm for dungeons
---
It works on feral as well.   I have had no issues collecting pieces of it.  I am a tank, so I can get a group anytime I want.  Shadowcraft was just an example anyways.
---
I rerolled off tank char because people cant play.
---
Even if you complete the dungeon its annoying as hell having every single pull just be a cluster fuck of mobs running everywhere because people cant stop themselves from pressing a button every 2 seconds instead of letting the tank hit something first
---

Probably made from that rare  *Tel'Abim Banana*
---
Almost level 28. There is so much detail in this game that I constantly feel overwhelmed. I feel like I need to take a course to play this game. I can't ever just play for an hour. It takes so much time and commitment. Also I have no idea what happens when you hit level 60...i get that you can raid, but what is the goal? How much time does a raid take? How can i find a guild, and how do i know if I'll like that guild or if they'll want me?
---
With enough population imbalance, that becomes PvE as well and suddenly you wish you could slaughter your own faction... 
---
-alli in Heartseeker
---
&gt; Maybe your DPS will be 1% better, but the tradeoff is very not worth it, unless you live for jerking off DPS charts.
---
This was your original point. That a small DPS boost isn't worth it. Nowhere did you claim that DPS that takes such an item is also not paying attention to raid mechanics. This whole discussion was about DPS - you suddenly made it about DPS failing at basic raid mechanics. It's the definition of a pivot.
---
If you have to go afk for 10 minutes then it's perfect. Just a budget mage port
---
It sure is, and despite having the numbers they still insist on waiting for you to pull first
---
Which is that addon that showed you the overpower target on the nameplate?
---
world bosses too
---
I guess on the server I'm on that's just the honeymoon period being over, either that or I just end up with all the min/maxers out there where 5 dps under some imaginary cutoff means I obviously suck at the game. 
---
Or something... I dunno. It annoyed me enough that I've gone back to retail, still doing classic every so often  but it's rough.
---
What mouse do use?
---
I ran an instance with a hunter named bowtsandhoes
---
Only time you'd want to use edgemasters as a human is if you're using axes or daggers. If you're running swords/maces it's really not worth it.
---
Dkp is annoying to track and has some major problems when people ignore upgrades to horde dkp.
---
You're not better for judging him so much either, just saying
---
You could have downvoted the post and moved on.
---
I stealth on my druid so they don't attack me and they think I'm stealthing to attack them. So they start to either AoE or just turn around and run away.
---
There isn’t an easy answer for that.  Are you in an active guild, are you playing a class that gets groups easier, is it 2AM or 5PM, are you wanting to run a more popular instance, are you making item reservation demands, it all factors in.
---
Made it to lvl 39 with my holy paladin on Golemagg, mostly repeating instances lately.. 
---
Having terrible FOMO though..
---
(Also LF reasonable pve guild)
---
I cannot check it out for you, but I think I had this as well in Vanilla for the simple reason of having only realm with characters. My (maybe wrong) theory is that if you have chars on multiple realms, it will show the realm selection list.
---
Posting single items on the AH isn't something you should be proud of. At all.
---
surprise egym
---
Speed is normalized in classic last I checked so that's irrelevant
---
If you’re an orc then yes that’s an absurd price. I see them go for 500g on my realm.
---
*[(slow clap)](https://i.imgur.com/dDvgKHd.gif)*
---
The real reason is that any proper lvl 60 tank will have been picked up by a guild that raids (or is going to raid) MC. Zero point in doing instances with randoms you might not know when you can just run the stuff you like with guildies you know the gear/skill level of..
---
I'm almost 60 and I've done mostly questing and very little grinding. This is my first WoW character and I've been impressed with how effective the game is at tying the level grind to questing. I'm always doing -something- for a quest, never feels like a slog.
---
Agreed. It’s disappointing the reputation some of my fellow mages are developing.
---
With the ability to teleport, I am often the first to arrive at dungeon entrances. I spend that extra 5 mins making an entire bag of water &amp; food. 
---
“Open trade for water and state how many stacks”
---
Remember... Knowbody loves you!
---
Just go for whatever has more stats on it.  A 2h weapon is better for when you do have to melee stuff because you pulled agro off your pet or whatever - but it's not really a consideration on which item is better.  There are lots of 2 handers out there - look for items that say "of agility" or "of the monkey,"  or "of power".  those are the items you want.
---
You can totally throw that on a resume
---
56.
---
Well I played a hunter in 2004, but I’ve seen so many hunters having a really hard time controlling their pets. I don’t remember ever having that problem.
---
So I guess maybe it was hard to control pets and I just knew to use passive to prevent it from causing problems?
---
Wrong !!!!! Bro I have them as an Orc Warrior lol . The difference is huge when I take them off this is coming from someone that DW Tanks lol. I’ve been able to tank even UBRS with edge master hand guards so much misinformation my god.  The game has been solved a long time ago please go to private server forums read old comments etc.
---
Im glad someone got him, even if it was preemptive :P
---
say that again after getting ganked at 50% hp
---
I wonder what ret gets
---
Sorry, I should have been more specific. I've seen comments where people claim it takes up to an hour sometimes, and I know that even with cross-realm LFG queues in retail I've waited up to half an hour for a group before. Is this rare at 60 in classic?  I figured it would be easier to post once and have a searchable list rather than spamming and monitoring a chat. Plus extra info about reserved loot, type of run expected, etc.
---
But where do you store the gold and silver coins?
---
Not the at all. I've tanked two or tree dungeons at 60, and I've run 20+ as fury DPS. The only times I'll tank is if a guildmate is begging!
---
Maybe. I've done a couple dungeons while leveling and currently 45.75.
---
So I've been thinking about how many zones I have to do yet to get my last 14.25 levels.
---
I haven't touched:
---
Winterspring    
---
Felwood    
---
Feralas (just a couple quests done)    
---
Tanaris (2 quests done)    
---
Un'goro    
---
Silithus    
---
EPL    
---
WPL    
---
Searing Gorge    
---
Burning Steppes    
---
Blasted Lands    
---
That's a whole lotta zones with quests and mobs to be done yet even with doing a handful of dungeons for the quests inside them.
---
MC resets every tuesday, Onyxia is on a rolling 5 day reset (But not based on when you clear it). You can check on the raid tab -&gt; raid info if you are saved, but idk if there is an easy way to check if you are not currently saved to it.
---
As far as dispelling, we will usually dispel reflexively, regardless of what the debuf is. This can lead to hilarity in the few cases a debuf is either beneficial, or does something really bad on dispel. There are times when we just don't have the GCDs to dispel, typically on fights where debuffs are really being spammed. In those cases, its a question of whether dispelling the debuf or healing is more critical in the moment.
---
That setup is sick, love the natural light
---
You actually just explained how it is manipulating game mechanics, the NPC guards cannot reach you...
---
It's not any more my area.  If they are intentionally tagging mobs I am currently casting on then there is a clear difference.
---
BFA?  no.  There was a rumor that you would get a character boost to 110 if you level to 60 in classic, but that apparently was just a rumor.
---
Thanks! AFAIK they were sold out 15 minutes after the pre-orders began...
---
You're free to do what you want but why would you deliberately hinder yourself?  If someone offers you a job at mcdonalds paying $8 an hour, or a job at another restaurant doing the same work for $15 an hour why would you go to mcdonalds and do the same work for half the pay?
---
Holy shit what a amazing idea!
---
The probably should not be there before DM is out, but no big deal
---
Another good game for women to try is Archeage me and my wife played that for years! It's got lots of sandbox elements but just don't let her touch the gambling side of things xD
---
Ally on Grobbulus are always ganking. Doesn’t matter how low leveled you are, if they see you you better be ready to bend over
---
the difference between the 30 40 and 50 water is 1000 mana each
---
990 vs 1990 vs 2990 (roughly) so at 40, getting lvl 30 water vs 40 water is noticeable but its not that much better. 
---
to say theyre going to drink x10 more, is stupid. yes they'll have to sit longer, but its like if they were sitting for 30 seconds it would be 45 seconds. its better they sit that extra 15 seconds then the mage spends almost 10minutes just casting water. you forget that theres more in the group then just the mage and priest (and that says nothing of if the group has more non mage casters then just the priest)
---
the tank probably doesnt want to sit there for 10 minutes.
---
my example is to show how entitled people are. from 31-39 this priest was happy to take the lvl 25 water, then the priest hits 40 and plays with a 40 mage and all of a sudden that 25 water is for peasants and they REFUSE to take it. demanding you spend 8 minutes crafting them the "good' water.
---
all the water sucks equally.
---
now at 31/41/51 this is far less crazy, you create 4 at a time, thats 5 casts per stack way better then the 10. and it improves as they lvl
---
once your at that point giving a stack of the 'good' water to the healer is sensible, its about 30 seconds for 2 stacks so every 80 seconds the mage makes 40 water and drinks thats 4minutes for 6 total stacks. thats fine
---
and it keeps improving every level, til eventually they make em 20 at a time at the 39/49/59 marks.
---
but the people who DEMAND they get the 'good' water when the mage just got it, those people are entitled. theyre entitled because they dont think about how the rest of the group feels. the healer is going to have to sit anyway, a lil extra sit time is less annoying then 10minutes of straight waiting. a few seconds here and a few seconds there is easier too digest and ignore.
---
Look at you all good at budgeting and shit.
---
Assuming you have Tactical Mastery (which if you don't I'd respec tbh) instead of using demo try switching to Berserker stance on pull, whirl and use berserker rage then switch to def stance and start tab sundering. If you're being hit BR will fill your rage bar quick letting you spam more sunders and work in heroic strikes if you're really overflowing
---
You can definitely tank as a paladin.  I am currently tanking ZF and Uldaman.  If you plan to tank in raids, the switch makes sense, however if your goal is to tank level 60 dungeons, paladins can do that.
---
Deathstriker, my vanilla dreams. Took 2 weeks off leveling and another rogue took place as top rogue in guild. He ended up in a guild run and it dropped. Could have been me, I told myself haha
---
Saw a binding drop on my 3rd MC run ever. it does seem like something's up.
---
Let him do whatever he wants man
---
None. You pay for a server transfer or you reroll.
---
It's still a long swim from what I remember, and as I said the boat follows the shoreline so it seems reasonable to just let it carry you most of the way instead of swimming on your own.
---
Ah yes, the first time I watched wrathgate I was drunk af and in complete jaw dropping awe so much so that I ticketed a gm telling them to congratulate everyone at blizz 😂
---
Why do people downvote this? The mage should support the group, but the group should also be polite about it. That means complete sentences, and expressions such as "may I" and "please".
---
YOU LIKE THAT!?
---
Clearly, I needs to get a zipper pocket for this! :)
---
B I G  G U Y.
---
The classic world drop items don't have your class design locked behind them.
---
This is not the right attitude to take in any at least semi-serious guild. If you can't put in the effort to get your prebis, why do you deserve to get raid loot over someone who has? Raiding in Classic is very much about preparation. You should come to raids fully prepared with all consumables, world buffs (where available), prebis gear and enchants. Yes the content might be easy, but it can always be done quicker and smoother. Every member of the raid should always strive to do the best that they can do and if you don't you can always be replaced by someone who does.
---
So I'm lvl 30 and am starting to seriously try to earn gold to save up for mount.
---
I got a drop of Savory Deviate Delight recipe yesterday. It's currently selling for 12g at AH. Should I sell recipe now, hold on to it and sell later if price goes up, or learn recipe and farm deviate fish and AH the dish?
---
I like using sword main hand and dagger oh
---
Well if there are marked mobs with Skull and X, focus on that obviously. But on trash that isn't marked, you should build your rage on the lowest level targets. You get less misses so more rage. Then you can dump that rage on the higher level mobs.
---
Yes, that has been the long standing blizzard rule is that loot rules must be established in the raid for it to be anything they will police.  They advise you to leave if you aren't satisfied with what is said or not said about loot in the raid chat.
---
You can, on eBay, for triple the price. Most of these were sniped by scalpers in 10 minutes.
---
Iirc no
---
When I transitioned from enh to elem at 40 I tried to stack up as much +spellpower as possible. I'm doing quite fine at lvl 48 right now.
---
I bought the dreamweave set out of the auction house (about 4-5g each piece), got the southsea mojo boots (simple quest reward from tanaris) and got the +sp shoulders and hypnotic blade from SM. 
---
Also I'm still using the SM cath shield as well.
---
These are all +spell power as I was not able to find any +nature damage gear out of the AH (I always find some super low level shit, which gives like +5 nature spell power)
---
U can literally buy a pot worth 70 s ( superior defense )  the threat generation from the Handguards  is way more valuable than 200 defense more .
---
I rolled with another guild's pug and second team group this week as a lowly level 58 mage that couldn't dven equip the epics and when I won the roll on the mage belt off MC trash they gave it to me and i had people from the guild hosting it crying about a level 58 getting it in their guild chat and another one whispering me to buy it... some guild pug groups are alright
---
I think you are confusing with Blood of the Mountain
---
Wasting resources on Hand of Ragnaros is something which hardcore player would avoid, not something he would be attracted to.
---
You can see the fingerprints of D&amp;D all over WoW. In D&amp;D rangers are half-casters.
---
 Go look up the guides. The math is out there why using them as orc or human is bad. Devilsaur set is better. It just is. For damage anyways. For tanking these non raids gear doesn’t matter at all.
---
I agree. But not with Mc
---
I'm new to wow (just got lvl 30) and I don't understand this at all. "Play the auction house"? Like find good deals?
---
Just hit 33 on my hunter, loving it. Havent played in 4 days because of work but im looking forward to my next weekend in November
---
There are auction sniper tools
---
I dont remember it being this way in vanilla.
---
The number of times as tauren you warstomp a group of mobs only to get 3 autos go through anyway and knock back your heal.
---
Or having mobs run through 3/4 of a blizzard before the slow kicks in.
---
I'm fairly certain it wasnt like this
---
Beautiful, thank you!
---
Oo is this some awesome leveling weak aura I've never heard of?
---
Cheers
---
Doubt.jpeg
---
Lol did you not bother to read?
---
Wow those charms were going for 1-5g each when I was lvl 40
---
ah, so 15 minutes a week
---
Nope. Its s long flight back to TB, but it's better than having to wait for zepps and ships. Port, hop on flight path, go make snack and drink. Ready to roll.
---
Well stacks of 5, getting close to level 40 and this was very satisfying for me.
---

---
You should try it out haha, took around 2 hours 30 in the end
---
Does it look like Diablo lmao..............................
---
Quests, dungeons and mob grinding. Some of those things require other people at times(quests) or are mandatory(dungeons).
---
You can mob grind by yourself or with other people but whether the class you play can efficiently mob grind is another thing in and of it's self.
---
For the horde the first dungoen is available for you around lvl12. 
---
Also look at server pop when choosing as that will impact some things like economy and finding people.
---
Are you unfamiliar with the MMORPG genre of yore?
---
Moonglade is pretty bare.  It feels as though they never finished the zone. Missing NPC's and what not.  
---
So, you will greet my Holy Righteous backside with a wide smile and a warm welcome, thank-you.
---
It’s a silly bot :/
---
Thats ELSE hes such an awsome tank on our server!!
---
Why do people act like getting your mount at 40 is an emergency? You don’t need to go out of your way to pickpocket for gold at lvl 40 just continue lvling. Questing and killing mobs will get you there
---
I like having moonglade for that quick and easy Kalimdor teleport and for the ability to quickly tele to moonglade, train a couple new spells, and hearth back to wherever i was questing
---
I remember that throw lmao Dak
---
No you cannot. We just tried last night. Some think there is a 6hr cd but I can't confirm that.
---
I'd say they do. My first ever toon was a night elf rogue. They have a good vibes starting zone and they're tall n good lookin, what more could you ask!
---
Holy shit they aren’t even that rare
---
If you wanna make a character, and you’re not min maxing, just pick what you like.
---
That being said if you’re looking to PVP or PVE or something then you might wanna consider other races.
---
Dwarf Rogues are formidable in PvP due to their ability to drop bleeds, and Humans are great due to their improved sword/mace skills.
---
i dont use shift 12345 either because its awkward for my hands, so instead i got Q E R T F V C and a shift version of each and ctrl + E R T F V C,  got a 4 button mouse so i use the side ones and shift for 4 extra hotkeys there also.  no idea HOW the FUCK people can ctrl /shift  1 2 3 4 5
---
Go night elf, it’s way better than human.
---
Am also on incendius

Don't give them ideas!

That's too much mana also
---
No I’m not. You’re using fucking strath tanking as fury to say I’m wrong. There’s a shit load of math out there about this. You’re the only guy here who says to use them as an orc or human.
---
The filter is a safeguard against profanity. That it can be turned off sure but if you swear in chat you're at risk of being reported and acted against. The profanity filter makes people feel like they're safe to swear because people can turn it off but its actually against the ToS and people get action taken against them.
---
That said you're right. Before watching Carnival Row I saw a bunch of 1 star reviews of people offended by the language. Witchcraft, murder, dismemberment, attempted rape, racism, homophobia. War, decapitation, executions. All fine. But it was the language that did it for these people.
---
I had a guild mate who is hesitant to watch it because of the language making her uncomfortable. How you can this position I do not understand and I feel strongly that it is a bizarre position to hold. None the less here we are. Swear in chat and get silenced. Literally murder the other player and that is fine. Its PvP.
---
Your right it is out there.
---
This blurb from the WOW Wiki - Calculations and Formulas.  http://www.wowwiki.com/
---
Each point of weapon skill you have over your opponent's increases your chances to crit and hit by 0.04%, and reduces your opponent's chance to block, parry, and dodge by 0.04%. Effectively you can consider it to be the inverse of the defense skill.
---
In addition, against mobs that are two or more levels above you, you will have a chance to land a glancing blow instead of a normal hit. A glancing blow may not crit and has a damage reduction proportional to the weapon skill to defense difference. Weapon skill reduces the severity of the damage reduction, not your chance to land a glancing blow.
---
For example, against mobs three levels above your own, with 300 weapon skill approximately 40% of your swings will be glancing blows, and the damage for those will on average be reduced by 30%. With +5 weapon skill, you will see the same amount of glancing blows (40%), but only 15% damage reduction. With +10 weapon skill, the damage reduction becomes negligible.
---
I'm also leveling elemental (since lvl 30, now 44). What I can tell you is that your rotation is very bursty. Sometimes you get lucky and your two lightning bolts crit, letting you finish off a mob with an Earth shock as it gets to you, and sometimes, the two lbs bring them only to 3/4 hp, at which point you flame shock and auto like you did while enhance. 
---
You should pick up a shield and a dagger (or any caster main hand), enchant with flame weapon, and have lightning shield up before all pulls for if an enemy gets to you. Elemental is more about conserving Mana as much as possible (abuse that 5 second rule), and ideally, only drinking after 5 or so mobs. At least that's been my experience with it.
---
Yeah, have to log in at a weird time to get that first batch of elementals, but I found very little competition at the next two spots. So worth it. The indurium that drops from the Troggs was also pure hell.
---
um yeah... that sounds awful. org would be much nicer.
---
also horde dont use ships for anything.
---
I can't even count the amount of times that somebody has been in my group and was afk(or at least not helping) or running past me while I kill something and they roll need on shit that drops.   Am I crazy for passing in this situation or is that just having common courtesy?
---
Shhh you are scaring all the nightfins away
---
You do know that some of the game happens outside of raids right?
---
We’ll look at this another way and why a website like this would be completely pointless.
---
Example 1:  You’re a level 60 Holy Priest LFG, any dungeon, you’re not picky.  You’re not going to have problem finding a group.
---
Example 2:  You’re a level 55 Hunter LF Molten Core.  If I was leading an MC run do you think I would have any problem getting a 55 Hunter in chat?  Why would I have to go to a website?
---
No one is going to tab out to a website to find someone to find something I could find in game in 2 seconds in the game, and if you’re a class that gets groups easy, you wouldn’t have to use a site anyway.  If you’re having problems finding a group in game for whatever reason, trust me, the site wouldn’t be helpful anyway.
---
I have never encountered this in game, as of 57 (plus various alts in their teens and a 25). I realize experience varies, but honestly I think it’s partly just that it’s a meme on this subreddit, so people are more likely to post bad interactions on here if it involves a mage for the extra karma, resulting in confirmation bias.
---
Yep on Herod
---
Doesn’t help that a lot of Horde players’ first experiences in World PvP happen in Hillsbrad where the Alliance have a massive level advantage. So that probably helps fuel the Horde bloodthirst when they finally see someone that they’re actually able to kill.
---
That literally is the dumbest point I think I've read in this whole thread, that's not even the point of the whole entire post it baffles me how you came to that conclusion.
---
I never get treated poorly as a tank. People love tanks. And people playing classic understand that tanks have limited tools in their kits.
---
Why do the same thing over and over again when I can spice it up and still make 40+ gold a hour?  Sorry I like to change it up :)
---
Suddenly my medium/high pop server seems like heaven
---
Anyone got a list of the addons he suggests? On my phone atm.
---
Not me.
---
I just watched the Dark Knight last night.  This makes me sad.
---
&gt;There are many types of databases, so again not sure why it's criminal for me to say SQL first
---
Exactly, there are many. Why do you say Blizzard used an SQL Database when you don't know?
---
They used *A* database. That's all we know. You're spreading misinformation, and now for some fucked up reason you can't just say "whoops my bad" but argue a point you are CLEARLY in the wrong on?
---
Why did I jump in here? Because you didn't just spread misinformation, you are now expend energy fighting with people for CORRECTLY pointing out you were staying ERRONEOUS information.
---
Jesus fuck grow up, you don't have to "win" everything.
---
Edit: I see you at least deleted your initial comment. Well done.
---
Yes. Basically making casters walk up to me so I can grab aggro on everything easier.

Are they hi-explosive by any chance? Those are for a quest in eastern plaguelands if im not mistaken

I'm at 30. Found myself having more fun trying to make money off the auction house. Think I have about 8 hours played on my bank alt!

No you're right. I realized after that part was a dumb statement. Edited.

She too made a NE female hunter

This is why I corse camp all NE hunters now

Lol you just trying to send people to their deaths, arent ya

Nice

Being a low level is the magic of grouping IMO. There are quite a few regular quests that are just insanely hard to solo for certain classes. Just ask in General Chat (`/1`) "Anyone able to help me with *quest name*?" If you see someone in the area doing the same quest, target them and type `/i` to invite them to your party and knock it out together. "Thanks for the group" "Need help with anything else?" Or "Hope I see you around" are all fine ways to end the party when you're done.
---
Don't be "you" in the game, be your character. When I started in 2005 I was a shy kid but in the game I was a guild leader, an agile Hunter and born to lead the destruction of the Horde. I was there to help my allies succeed, even if it meant running across the zone to help someone gather mushrooms.
---
I wouldn't have been able to do that as the 90 lb nerd that let people throw shit at him in school. To be fair, I deserved it for wearing corduroy pants, but Lithurge the hunter wouldn't wear corduroy pants.
---
That's how mages feel when they see non-mages talking to Tabitha in Dustwallow Marsh.

Was swimming at the left sea of Desolace today, died from Fatigue and my spirit was teleported to Westfall.

... thank you for telling me what weapon skill does? Jesus Christ that’s not what I’m talking about. Please go look at the readings about why edgemasters on orc or humans is bad. Or I’ll post it when I get off work and on my computer.
---
If you were in our guild you wouldn’t have prio.
---
The real reason is that end game content calls for a 1:39 ratio of tanks to others while the leveling content calls for a 1:4 ratio.
---
There is a free character migration option if you want to use it. Just saying. If you play on a highly populated server you have to expect login queues.
---
how can u even afford that much thistle tea? swiftthistle is likie 6000g per stack on my server I have a hard time making myself buy it for raids, let alone random dungeons/pvp
---
There’s a staff from the West fall quest chain that finishes when you finish DM. Also the last boss in DM drops a really great staff that I’m still using at level 28. Also the Murloc boss at the end drops a nice wand.
---
You're lying if you tell me you don't spin your camera backwards for a few seconds after passing the opposing faction.
---
FYI this is straight up prohibited and if you keep doing it you will get a temp ban at least.
---
Blizzard doesn't play games when it comes to gambling regardless of how innocent and they're cracking down on this of late. 
---
Just a heads up to stop while you're ahead.
---
Ahhhh the tunnel of death.

And then not realizing theres a damn horde FP literally right next to the entrance... god damn.

I’m replying with this twice since you replied to me twice with the exact same thing.
---
Idealy IIRC for best results in raid DPS for dual wielding you need +15 to weaponskill or so and no more then 19% crit + 1% for every +1% to hit on your gear
---
to an extent, theres also some signs of a soft crit cap due to glancing blows being uncrittable hence the desire for + weapon skill as it seems only weaponskill actually reduces the frequency of glancing blows
---
Edit: Soft cap is at 310 ignore above.
---
Yes! Makes more sense now haha
---
You have to pack water in case your group doesn’t have a Mage. If it does, we are obligated to make you some. However, especially if we just got a new rank of conjure water, everyone in the group has mana, and this isn’t our first dungeon of the night, you might have to wait a while as we make some more.
---
Nah, they're not. They're perfectly acceptable considering the quality of photo provided, as with this, is usually shit.
---
Their tusks originate [from the upper jaw](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/5/5c/TrollSkullMaleTusks.png), so they don't really get in the way. Plus their mouth is much wider. Tusks likely don't bother them as much as we think.
---
I think that's the joke
---
/wave.... *stealth noises*
---
So as the player base starts to dwindle and less are online the servers can still present "high" or even "full" population on the login screen.
---
Yup, roll greed as no one knows it's content. Offer your services thereafter.  
---
Also if you come across a locked chest, unlock it but do not loot until the roll has been done. If you accidentally auto-loot, apologise and offer to not roll for the loot and give the loot to the winner.  
---
Edit: Seeing the replies, maybe I'm too nice =P
---
Would they be doing this to gain more underlings? People who aren’t the upper echelon but will still contribute in some way?
---
They are useless for sword/maces.  But if you go axes which is not uncommon for alliance warriors(those pesky rogues am i right?) then it's quite good.
---
Who'd you decide on for your main?

Eh, which one are you thinking about?

None have better weapon damage or stats.
---
Yes, this has been highly entertaining.
---
As a fellow mage i feel your pain. Iv noticed as the  hardcores are hitting 60 I'm seeing less of the ae spam in LFG. I think its just the raiders who don't care for leveling and just want the quickest road to end game content
---
I got really close to it at one point but to be honest I feel bad doing that. I'm at level 49 now and up to this point we have only ever had to straight up kick one other person so it's not something I like to do if i dont absolutely have to. Hindsight says I should have though.
---
Spelling and grammar.
---
Wow did more for me than high-school ever did.
---
Insider trading in this sense would be if someone posted in guild chat that they were about to flood the market in, say, linen cloth and warned everyone to sell their linen cloth now at the higher prices.
---
Go to mograine :)
---
Honestly, no one should take that shit. I'd leave immediately even if I was in the middle of the dungeon. Regroup with the rest.
---
Yes, 44 is the halfway point
---
Shadowfang is BiS for both Rogue MH and Warrior Twink 19. Assassin's Blade isn't even the OH BiS (Cruel Barb is).

Because some locks tap to 14hp giving healers heart attacks I prefere slow tapping and a hit on me.
---
To be honest it sometimes feels a bit unnecessary, but it's not as gigantic as having 2 vertical monitors. I use this one to permanently open up joanas leveling guide, or stuff like Spotify and discord. 
---
I also got this one for cheap from Craigslist, so it didn't hurt at all and does it's job.
---
Depends...  If I am Alliance I would change it fast ... If I Horde I won't. ;-) but it's server independent.
---
Yes Luca runs are if you want to skip or smelt dark iron.
---
PvP for some is waiting until you pull too many mobs and then finishing you off at the worst possible time.  I don’t understand the appeal.
---
Picking up your phone, unlocking it, opening the camera app, taking a picture, navigating to the image upload app, uploading it, then going to reddit and sharing it... is somehow easier than simply pressing PrntScrn and then Ctrl+V to paste?
---
Wish I felt the same
---
Look at that cablemess under the desk, horrible!
---
&gt;Are you forgetting that there are classes that use 2Handers in PvE?
---
Apologies, I was refering to warriors using 2h in particular. But of course for paladins and shaman it's a must have in PvE.
---
I would expect it's easier/faster to get BRE/nightfall/phase3+ weapons for most paladins and shamans though.
---

I’ve been in countless raids where 39 people are asking what dropped, so the rl links all the loot, but that doesn’t mean everyone roll on it.
---
Listen, you are upset, you lost out on some thing you wanted pretty badly - I get it. This is the way of classic wow, keep at it and when you do get it, it will be all that more awesome.
---
The one little quest chain thats out there right now sends you there with some book and then it just sort of ends.
---
I wasn't mad at all. Fucking bugs...
---
I have a 14 Undead Rogue that I'm playing kinda immersive style. I'm not looking up guides or anything, just roaming and exploring. Reading all the quest text. Working on my crafting skills and sometimes just hunting for herbs in lower level areas. I am glad the map isn't constantly telling me exactly where to go.
---
I played WoW at release but didn't get very far. I'm familiar with the first 20 levels or so from that and my short stints on private Vanilla servers. As soon as I heard about WoW Classic, I stopped playing on those so I could play the official server fresh.
---
So far so good. I only get an hour or so to play a few nights per week. If I'm lucky I'll get a couple hours.
---
I suggested this approach to epic boes and was laughed at - "why play an mmo if you can't trust people????"
---
That poor dude will learn fast I'm sure.
---
In BWL, AQ, and Naxx, this is accurate, MC and Ony don't need this sort of preparation to down the bosses.
---
Half the reason I'm struggling as an alchemist right now is because people don't care about consumables in these raids, at least on my server.

You can literally do the raid with 20 competent people so there isn't much point wasting the money

It’s like the most egregiously disconnected from reality circlejerk I’ve ever seen on a gaming subreddit. I have literally encountered zero Mages like this with over a hundred levels spread across a 57 and a few alts.
---
Sell the recipe.

You could do those other things, however, fishing consumes time. You’re only 30, level up. Take the gold and run.

The correct answer is dwarf

It is, they just want to feel like they are severely outnumbered.

I farmed a bit my self.

I’ve got skinning right now. Super easy to level and I’m lvl 53 rn mage and been soloing devilsaur leather since 52. Super fun and great gold

Being afk kicks you to character select screen I think.
---
Oh damn, i mean there is a reason I have another angle for regular pictures of my Station. You got me on this one.
---
Tanks get treated like shit because 9/10 refuse to tank or say “I’m a dps warrior”
---
Taking a picture with your phone and uploading it on apollo is easier AND more authentic.
---
Lmfao the downvotes. People really get triggered over the phone pictures here.
---
I suggest you do the same took me 3 seconds to find private server forum posts old comments . Don’t do the same mistake people did in vanilla guys.
---
Idealy IIRC for best results in raid DPS for dual wielding you need +15 to weaponskill or so and no more then 19% crit + 1% for every +1% to hit on your gear.  You won’t get anywhere near that unless your Orc or Human hence why they are the best gloves in the game for warriors.
---
Make sure you are killing mobs below level then. I am specced prot now and I was killing dinos in Un Goro that were 1 level above me at 54. No issues really. Just gotta regen after like 3 pulls or so

---
NA is not the only region.
---
Came in here with this exact phrase in mind lmao
---
Regarding to resetting dungeons for farming, after inviting my alt in to the party and promoting leader to it, is it possible for me to reset it all by myself by logging onto my alt?
---
Or do I need someone active (friend/guildie/stranger) in the party in order to reset properly?
---
Die and spirit Rez at that point
---
I told her dwarfen can be hunters too. Took one quick look accompanied by "eew no" until switching back to nightelf :D
---
Not really. I hadn't played wow in eight years and rolled an alliance tank because it's the complete opposite of what I'm drawn to (I have a special place in my heart for mages) and I wanted a challenge.
---
Yes, but i prefer to know when its not working (which is fairly often).
---
You get it. I consider myself "casual" by this definition. I hit 60 a week ago. I also had 14 days /played. I consider myself casual because I don't spend my time in game as efficiently as possible, I just play for fun. But if I try and explain that to somebody, they start gatekeeping that I couldnt possibly be a casual player because I'm already 60. I took 9 days vacation for launch, but beyond that I work 60 hours a week. In my mind, casual players don't care about efficiency per hour, whereas more hardcore players do. People constantly tell me I cant be a casual player simply because I have no responsibilities outside of my insane work hours, and my play time reflects that.
---
Edit: Sorry guys, it appears I am no longer able to use definitions of words as what they mean, so my entire ability to communicate with all of you has been removed. I will speak to all of you in recorded grunts I upload to sound cloud from here on out. I've simply been enlightened to the fact the words I've used my whole life possess no bearing, and you big brain motherfuckers should be able to deduce my thinking from the discerned connotations and inflections of my grunts.
---
hey, furbolgs in our guild! I feel like I know a celebrity
---
Do you communicate them to them kill your faction members and scout for them so you no one else can farm devilsiar? Nah. 
---
It's not ToS I suppose but I think it's pretty shitty and against the core values of the game. Horde want leather? Ally attacks. Ally wants leather? Horde attacks. There shouldn't be this sanctioned guilds bullshit, cross faction deals and scout out other to kill who get a spawn.
---
No you don’t want 15 weapon skill. That’s just so wrong. There’s math out there I’ll post it when I’m off work if it isn’t posted already. It shows the exact reasons why you don’t use them as an orc or human. I’ll comeback this afternoon and reply again plus edit because you’re at least going through the effort to show you work so I’ll do thit same.
---
Why is the shadowfang sword will be needed when phase 3 comes out?
---
He doesn't need to advertise that stuff is reserved in the channel, especially since he appears to only be inviting players which won't compete for his gear.   I think he was polite, and I'd recommend you stop spam whispering people with "inv dps" as a warrior when you aren't what they are asking for.
---
Click on the flair. Just figured that out lol
---
Goblin ships
---
This is exactly what I expected out of this community with the release of classic.
---
Alliance-side, using that flight path costs what seems like a LOT of money at low levels, and saves you little time on many routes.  If money is an issue then I'm not going to start using it until around the time I'm adventuring in Felwood.
---
I want to play Rogue. I enjoy playing Rogue the most. However, I'm afraid that because of the overpopulation and competition, I won't be able to get a guild / raid spot / etc.
---
I have a Warlock the same level (both are 40), but I enjoy it less. 
---
Do I play the class I enjoy the most and risk getting shut out of raid groups and minimize my chances at finding a good guild? Or do I play the class I like less in the hopes that I'll have a better time finding a guild and group? 
---

"No, he's too valuable where he is. Give the promotion to someone who doesn't perform so well but HR won't let you fire."

I know you're upset but to explain layers..
---
Think of the server as a apartment building and a layer as a floor within that apartment building.
---
Each floor(layer) has a certain amount of apartments(players) within that building(server).
---
It wouldn't effect the queue.
---
But if you dont have attachments to that server or can convince your friends, you should have a free server move available :)

Oh so your pet doesnt attack at all?

You know beast mastery is the best dps spec til BWL right?
---
And all your damage resides in your pet.
---
Let's not even start about pvp
---
Hope this is your spare PC, if not wave goodbye to your PC.
---
You definitely should have recorded it!
---
Only Bgs are coming not arena. Arena released in tbc.
---
Wonder how much of the "difficulty" stems from just being terrible?  Like, I killed a mage nine levels above me who attacked unprovoked yesterday because he was too stupid to counterspell Fear and followed me all the way to the Orc farm in Arathi.
---
I spent the majority of my teenage years thinking this. But people called little known information factoids and I just assumed I was wrong. Never really thought to look.
---
Then you can be trolling me and I can actually be wrong. But I am too lazy to check so I'll just go with my bias. Hey. At least I'm honest about it.

I’m okay with that.

So they have a 66% drop rate on eyes? o.O Hasn't it only been 3 raiding lockouts?

As a dwarf priest who had to turn in a quest there and as a long time druid main- trust me, I did not feel like I was where I was supposed to be
---
Agree. In BC i had the worst roll luck and despite being healing class captain who attended every raid, others who rarely came were way more geared than I. Sometimes it makes sense to take away the chance factor.
---
I know the whirlwind axe is the best but how much does taking the hammer gimp you by comparison? I like the look of the hammer more and I don't care about min maxing, just wondering...
---
52 is where I go to Un'goro.  Plenty of quests to get about a full level from it.  Grab a Mythril Casing before you go for the A-Me quest.
---
Main ones are Shadowed Unit Frames, Dominos for bars, Details for damage meters, KUI Nameplates, Leatrix Map &amp; Sexymap for minimap, Chatter for chat and a few scripts to make it nicer, OneBag3, Auctioneer, Atlast Loot &amp; Maps, Questie, Leatrix Plus and a lot more quality of life minor ones. :D
---
I'm lvl 37 on yojamba oceanic pvp
---
What spec are you farming as?
---
Another theory than the one of the other repliers to your question is that roll numbers are not integers. Therefore there could be decimal digits that are not displayed on the roll. Hence if 2 players have a roll tie, let's say 90 and 90, then it could be for example 90.53 and 90.24, which would mean the first one wins.
---
Disclaimer: I only have a bachelor's degree in loot expertise. Sorry in advance.
---
Definitely a lot. Alot is not a word
---
That solo leveling warrior or a priest is still way more fun than any other class.
---
Seriously if you're not playing a warrior or a priest and find yourself bored or falling asleep
---
You're secretly a warrior/priest main.
---
You just put it on passive when it starts running off and pulling all kinds of random shit. I see so many people’s pets pull half a dungeon somehow and I have no idea how or why because you get easy explicit control of everything your pet does.
---
How about think before you say shit dude. Jesus this community wtf...
---
Could you be more of an idiot
---

---
Buying vendor stuff in stacks like water/food is incredibly aids on Classic compared to pservers. Click to buy 100 water, wait 5 seconds to see how much actually appears in your bags, legit feels like seconds worth of lag, no idea why is that a thing.
---
Sounds like mid sententeced attacked and then rage quit :D
---
It's not like we're pushing the debuff slots.. so it pushes of or gets pushed off by a corruption? The weapon damage more than makes up for it
---
True.
---
So, down ranking is to improve your sustain, but its a bit of a catch22, the better your gear, the less you need to downrank, but the more benefit you get from it. I've run the numbers on my current gear (Mostly pre-bis, or near-bis), assuming Blessing of Light, which should be on everyone in raid: 
---
* FoL6 - 6.2 Heal/Mana, 499 heal/s
---
* FoL4 -7.35 Heal/Mana, 380 heal/s
---
* FoL1 - 13.1 Heal/Mana, 263 heal/s
---
* HL4 - 7.0 Heal/Mana, 460 heal/s
---
So, you can see that you can get very high efficiency downranking FoL, but you loose throughput. With Holy Light rank 4, you get efficiency, without loosing much throughput. (Can't go below rank 4 HL, as spells below level 20 don't act the same)
---
From a purely numbers standpoint, Holy Light rank 4 is a great heal to use. There is a really big caveat though, there are 8-15 other healers in your raid, and unless you aggressively stop-cast spells, you will end up with a lot more overheal on the rank 4 holy light, due to the longer cast time.
---
Personally, I find full strength FoL is the way to go. We kill MC bosses quickly enough that only Major Domo, and Rag live long enough that mana starts to become a problem. Liberal use of Major Mana pots and other raid consumables, and even those fights you can spam all day.
---
Exactly.
---
you know our BIS robe needs 10x essance of water. maybe he is farming them. maybe you all should just get better at tagging mobs.
---
I’ve got that quest since 3-4 lvl bcuz I don’t know how to get there lol
---
Those should come in handy.
---
Do I wait 2 mins while logged out or while on my alt?
---
I didn't know the leader will pass automatically.
---
Yea, but the entire moonglade is friendly units only, so no need for combat stats. If you're there for the mara quest turn in and flight path, half your rez sickness will be spent traveling anyway.
---
I was in a similar situation until recently. It’s also maybe obvious from my clearly-lurking reddit account. It was very intimidating to go into a completely new game where you feel like everyone’s been playing for years and will be impatient with you.
---
To get started with my “player interactions”, I finally got the courage to join a dungeon at the highest possible recommended level (joined a level 13-19 dungeon at level 19). Not sure if it was the most efficient thing to do, but it meant I definitely felt useful even if my game knowledge was practically zero and I had no clue what dungeons were.
---
I’d recommend you to do something similar, and just ask people who seem like they’re doing the same quests as you if they’d like to join you (this makes questing nicer for both players a lot of the time). **Let people know you’re new to the game**, especially if it makes you feel more comfortable! People will be more understanding and in a lot of situations will offer advice and help.
---
Also feel free to message me for game help even though I‘m a noob.
---
It sucks, I love tanking (been tanking for more than 10 years) but I'm also a WPvP'er and impatient guy that likes to level fast so I can't play a Warrior.
---
Then again, considering 90% of players I've seen so far have zero respect for tanks... It's not as satisfying with this community.
---
Well I certainly don't feel like I'm pressing a lot more abilities when playing my retail lock than Affli in classic. I don't have siphon life as a castable spell and Coil is speccable talent vs circle. Warriors don't have that many abilities in retail compared to classic either.
---

---
&gt;Reply
---
That's funny because 9/10 DPS will invite a warrior as DPS and then ask them to tank.
---
Yup, learned to type from wow and runescape.
---
there are reasons beyond gold to farm essence of water friend.
---
I prefer to be called a murderous vending machine.
---
I've played retail with my wife quite alot, but she'd get frustrated if she died or didn't know what to do. So I think classic wouldn't be for her. But reading that alot of you guys wives enjoy classic makes me wonder if mine actually would.

30/0/21. Ele with some resto. The go to PvP spec and more than good enough to heal.
---
I wouldn't promote him. He's telling you all the things he's done. But what will he do to make the guild better in the future?
---
Or a rogue.  Rogues need to die because there's about a 110% chance they'll stealth nearby and wait for you to overcommit to a pull before popping out and stunlocking while allowing the mobs to get the last hit for durability damage.
---
Gnome rogues?  Get the fucking Apache helicopter.
---
I understand why they're gatekeeping, because you're acting like a casual without being one.
---
See, you may just play for fun and fluff around without efficiently spending your time, but there's one thing that sets you apart from a casual: You took 9 days vacation for launch.
---
That's not casual. A casual doesn't take time off for the game, they just play it whenever they have the time.
---
Sure, there are lots of definitions for casuals, but I can assure you that no actual casual would take time off for playing the game at launch. 
---
Now, personally I don't give a hoot about what people call themselves (casual/hardcore etc), but I can definitely see why some people would begin gatekeeping when you say you're casual yet spend actual vacation days on the game.
---
I think that's just warriors in general during the leveling process
---
It's def gonna drop on the next run.
---
I just hit lvl 35 and are loving Stranglethorn Vale all over again, not just the Pvp, but the quests are plentiful and the zone is so well build. No rush here, just taking my time.
---
My night elf rogue is my "super relaxed character." Since I'm not grinding like a mad man on him, it's nice to just stealth past mobs, pick some pockets, and never, ever be seen. (Occasionally stared at, but I'll still pick their pockets while they're doing it.)
---
It's a much more relaxed - albeit slow - leveling experience.
---
Detect magic, sheep them for 20s and then kill them. Free honor, that's how you rank up.
---
Get ready to see every boomer in the world cry on this sub. Also watch me get ranks in menethil harbor.
---
It's likely a teenager who isn't used to formulating professional emails who has English as his second language. With those assumptions considered I think he did a good job.
---
It was definitely amazing. Both the Wrathgate and the fact you ticketed them to praise them for it lol.
---
If the only mobs you ever killed were directly for your quest you wouldn't have hit 60 questing. You had filler mobs that helped you bridge the gap.
---
100% going to try this now.
---
&gt; whoever had the highest greed roll
---
Game wont roll greeds if there was a need BTW, you have to ask the whole group to /roll
---
DNB sucks. Doesn't even sound like anything to do with a bank unless you're from a specfic country with the bank 'DNB'
---
DNB to me is drum and bass lol
---
I want a real bank guild on alliance razoregore pls
---
I'd suggest doing the opposite. Start grouping early when the game is more forgiving and less is expected of you. If you wait until later you'll just be intimidated by what people expect of you at that level. 
---
Or don't, nobody knows you better than yourself.
---
Find good deals is one, yes. Do shuffles (for example you buy components for a crafting recipe, craft the item and sell it for more than the cost of the components), control certain markets by resetting them (want to sell all your X for Y gold? buy all of the X listed under Y gold, put them all back up at your price ; requires a lot of base investment and can be just impossible for certain very common items).
---
Also my face when I realize the FP is druids only and now I have to run my ass back to winterspring.
---
Layers don’t fix this lol.
---
I just love this. The whole pic/comments situation should be posted in r/dundermifflin
---
The majority of servers are in the 60:40 range.  Not ideal, but definitely not "heavily imbalanced" either.
---
Hey I found more math for you .
---
https://i.imgur.com/SQCxAHS_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium
---
Maybe, just maybe... wow classic isn't for you. It takes like 6 days of /played to get to 60, if you can't get to 60 in like 3 months then play bfa?
---
Or just play on a pve realm, you won't get camped.
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
No the average dmg of windfurry output really isn't very good. What is good is when it randomly bursts, but that will win you like 1/10 encounters.
---
Ok but people with an IQ over 80 realize that you can buy things on the AH, and if you make more gold/hour farming something else than you do farming your own essences, that's the best route.  I'm not saying he can't farm them, in fact I very plainly said the exact opposite.   I just wonder why people opt to use their time so inefficiently when it also directly negatively impacts other people.
---
Actually it does. Queues went up when they said they reduced layers.
---
305 weapon skill you have 30% chance at glancing blow. At 312 it’s only 16% chance. There you go. I will be waiting for your math tho.
---
You can do that from wowhead too.. Go to item, click Links, paste in game
---
That quest where you have to kill the Lesser Rock Elementals is absolute hell for Alliance on PvP servers. The drop rate on the stone shards is abysmal and for some reason the only place those particular elementals spawn is perpetually swarming with Horde.
---
The Orcs willingly decided to drink Mannoroth's blood. Then they invaded.
---
Then Humans did NOT cull them when they were in the Camps.
---
Then Varimathras, then Putress, then Garrosh, then Sylvanas.
---
Man, fuck the "Horde". They've always messed things up, all the time.
---
Everyone is leveling their alt because they're done farming their prebis and MC only takes like 2 hours to clear.
---
I wasn't aware Paladins and Shamans are considered "classes that use 2Handers in PvE"
---
I mean sure, if you're going to raid as Ret or Enhancement, go nuts with Sulfuras if your raid lead is willing to sacrifice a debuff slot for you and your meme spec, but the second phase 3 hits, you're going to stash away that shiny orange Hammer and bust out the old trusty Nightfall.
---
I mean if you want ess of water for your class robes or an enchant, than you either have to farm for it, or it’s going to cost you gold. So ya, farming anything is always about making or saving gold.
---
Frostbolt scales very well.
---
Yup, still. Multishot does the same thing.
---
It's still much better data than butthurt peoples' gut feelings about the "heavy imbalances."
---
If you keep a set of Int gear in your bank you can pull those out for healing. Just keep any good quest rewards and any decent green drops you get, you don't need to put too much effort into collecting it.
---
You can tank/dps with your standard questing feral gear.
---
Up to level 40 or so your spec isn't going to matter too much.
---
True, no way he was only gone 10 minutes to get to this point.
---
Someone trying to twist my words and imply an untrue nature to i my comment can fuck off for sure. That’s as toxic as it comes.
---
As a hunter, I really wish I could be a dwarf as I enjoy the fantasy of being a dwarven hunter using big guns to kill big animals. The aesthetic fits really well. 
---
Mechanically though I can't shake the desire to be a night elf and Shadowmeld + Prowl with a cat to set up ambushes on unsuspecting Horde, as well as using engineering to my advantage. 
---
I kind of got over it though when the idea of a "dark elf gunslinger" came to my mind as sort of a colonial-era Drizzt Do'Urden running around with pistols.
---
It's the best twink weapon for lvl 19, bg's and such come out in phase 3 in which you can pvp with ur twink and thus need the sword.
---
And the racials. This time around -everyone- knows how strong horde racials are for pvp. Back in vanilla most people went with what they thought looked coolest and stuck to it.
---
I play a 'casual' 2/3 hours almost every night. And I've hit just 48 last night. I didn't have my gold at 40, was 40g short, but one of my warlock guildies lent me some. Just enjoy the ride.
---
You kept calling someone a boomer, what’s that mean?
---
did you ever find an answer?
---
I wonder how well it'll hold up to wear n tear...
---
You do know that census didn't work for a long while right? Since Blizzard capped the /who function so census can't be done anymore since middle september.
---
Or did some people find a way around it and tweaked it so that they can do it again?
---
In all honesty its not just mages. I had to switch from Enhancement to Resto shaman because I was tired of waiting around an hour to find a dungeon group...
---
I’m not on Razorgore but I was wondering, what is your guys’ stance on regular characters? Is it exclusively for bank alts or can you have one or two characters that are regular toons?
---
My bank/auction alt used to be BillyMays, human. When he died I made an undead bank alt with the same name and retired the first one.
---
Me and our guild core are always on that shit like mosquitoes if we see a guildless dude in our group.. We start to sweet talk him immediately and finally ask if he wants to join our guild by the end of it (provided the person is a cool dude ofc)
---
You don’t want underlings in a hardcore guild. They meme in your guild chat to the point that it’s unusable for communicating important information. They also bring down the “status” of your guild—ie other hardcore guilds will see you as the carebear guild because they grouped with someone who had your guild tag who was awful.
---
It will still be better than any other weapon you get save for ww axe. The reason axe is good are two fold. 1) attack power (i.e. battle shout) scales with weapon speed. A slightly slower weapon gets more bonus from strength buffs per swing. Because warrior has access to instant attacks that ignore weapon speed, like overpower, having a slower weapon means more damage. 2) arms specialization has access to axe specialization, which is just better for pve (pvp you could argue for mace). Technically mace is worse for white damage than sword (which is what you may want if you are 2H fury leveling). However, at the end up the day go with whatever you want, i see level 40s running around with worse weapons than both axe and mace so you will be fine.
---
Most of those zones only give you about 1 level of xp from their quests. So rough estimate is you are still gonna be 2-3 levels short from 60 if you don't run dungeons, wich you probably will. 
---
In reality the only class that will really grind those couple outs from mobs are mages
---
My pally is Healonmusk -.-
---
Disco talent to reduce the mana cost of instant casts counts towards pws
---
this is why we use /s
---
Play what you enjoy, the gear will come with time. Find a guild you enjoy and secure a raid spot
---
Because the stakes are literally 0.
---
Well fuck, guess I'm walking back to Moonglade. At least this time I'm unfriendly with the Timbermaw so they won't bash my skull in as I run through their tunnels.
---
I remember watching the boss with the same skin in SSC do this. I'm sure someone here knows the name of the boss I'm referencing. Listening to the RL give us a rundown of the fight while we stand in front of the boss and he just starts popping his fart bubbles.
---
It's more efficient for you maybe. Sometimes I want to turn camera with keyboard. Sometimes I want to move horizontally.
---
Upgrades!
---
As a lock I've been able to juggle a mob  ack and forth between me and my pet not easy or high dps out put but can help on those mob that hit just a bit too hard
---
Probably just showed up at a convention where at any given moment you've got elves, orcs, Kratos, Master Chief, and 30 different Deadpools running around and figured it'd be a funny picture.
---
That FP sucks though, at least for Horde. It only takes you to TB, but it takes the *scenic route* that's, like, 15 minutes.
---
There are actual Horde and Alliance FPs on Moonglade, but they're outside of Nighthaven.
---
&gt;i hate fucking everything about the orcs. from that insufferable “HOO” every time they take a swing, to that god damn laugh i can only describe as “wet”, the one that the low levels will span because they know if you kill them, you get no honor. god i hate them so much. this entire server must be purged.
---
Pro tip:  find better things to do than ganking low level orcs and you'll hear that sound a lot less
---
Five times in an hour, I believe.
---
doesn't matter if you disagree when what I've stated is verifiable fact. You have many more damage sources on retail like [this](https://i.imgur.com/9EMSlsm.png) whereas in classic your warlock has like 3 damage sources, corruption agony and shadow bolt. I guess also your pet.
---
You will get a guild i promise, maybe not a hard core min max group, but 95% of players simply won't care
---

---
well that's pretty cool, just tried it out.  I'd still love to have the addon, but this was helpful.  Thanks!
---
Soulshard farming takes SO MUCH longer than water, too.
---
*Regional manager*
---
There are nondruid ones.
---
But how does it count?
---
Do I have to do exactly 5 runs and THEN the 1 hour counter starts  ticking? Or can I do 4, wait 1 hour, and then do 5 without issue?
---
Ew. I wouldn't tip that mindset, even with the back of a hand.
---
I made the mistake of starting on a PvE realm because my friends were there and rerolled to a PvP server. Absolutely worth it. PvE ruleset sucks the life out of the game for me and I haven't had any trouble accomplishing content with the later start on the PvP character.
---
haha boomer
---
You realise there is a regular flight path just south of the lake, right?
---
You can literally take the picture and upload it all from within the Reddit app.  Takes less time than screenshotting it, going to reddit, then browsing for your screenshot and uploading it.
---
You can reset it five times per hour.
---
Mine didn't start at 3. It's just saying 3 was normal classic mode, not that you have to or should use it.
---
Can anyone explain why with 5/5 Thundering Strikes my crit is as follows.
---
12% - 2H
---
7% - 1H
---
9% Unarmed
---
Im so fucking confused
---
I should note that with my 1H, my shield gives Agi and my 2H does not increase crit in any way
---
Its a lvl 19 twink weapon, meaning rogues et al will want it to farm honor in battlrgrounds
---
Not a problem.  I rambled a bit so here’s a quick version of why this type of website would be pointless.
---
I think we can all agree that the main determining factor in how long it takes to find a group is class.  Classes like tank and heals will always find groups fastest.  So those classes would have no need for the site.  Classes that have a harder time, like DPS, is because their are so many of them that it’s hard to get picked a lot of the time.  So no one looking for DPS is going to need the site, either, because if they ask for DPS in game they’ll get 10 whispers immediately.  Why bother with a site?
---
did you even read the post? lol
---
You don't understand my question, nevermind
---
You should take your own advice.
---
Like your comment is jumbo of mess that doesnt make any sense.
---
It starts out as advice and then mid sentence turns into a compliant and ends in a bad attempt of insult.
---
And analyzing all that would suggest you're barely a teenager, if that.
---
And the response to my comment that I was hoping for, is
---
 "Keep your pet on passive and have pet attack and pet follow macros and keybinds" 
---
See I talk in ways that challenges and test people.
---
Most simple minded people just get angry...kind of like you.
---
And to answer your question to how a pet pulls half a dungeon.
---
The target the pet is attacking starts to run away in fear...and usually the target runs towards other mobs.
---
And if there are multiple mobs the hunter most likely doesnt have their attention on what mob their pet is attacking. It's something hunters learn to be mindful of.
---
Each ID has its own seperate 1 hour timer, and you can maximum have 5 IDs
---
So if you did 4 mara runs in say 30 mins, and waited inside an instance for 30 mins, then that should total 5 ID's but the first mara run should run out, meaning if you play at the same pace, you can do 4 runs and then enter the 5th dungeon after 30 mins like you did previously.
---
Quick note about this build while leveling.. put that last point in elemental mastery when you ding 40! You can respec at 60 to natures swiftness, but lvling 40-60 with just 1 point not in elemental mastery is silly.
---
You can still apply wizard oil, you still have access to Drainlife / DC for instaburst and shadowburn. The rest is just minor traits from Azerite, which I'll admit I did not account for.
---
Many People will eventually flee when they're the slightest in the minority, and I can't blame them with the lowbie gankings or 5v1 ganks that goes on in PvP servers.
---
Blizzard should've made it so you can only make a toon of the faction with the lowest percentage of people, denying you to make let's say a Horde toon if there's X % more Horde than Alliance.
---
It's debatable that many people will be pissed because their friend is on their favorite faction or they want to play a Shaman at all costs, but hey it's for the greater good imho.
---
No way dude, 25-40 takes a long ass time running everywhere on foot
---
It's a PUG so whatever. 
---
**Realistically though, the helm should ALWAYS go to tanks for the necklace. Lots of tanks will get baited into getting the trinket and they are idiots. The necklace is absolutely disgustingly BiS for tanks. If there are no tanks or warriors in need, then it can go to your guild leatherworker and then melee/hunter DPS as a last resort. No caster/healer should ever want the Onyxia head.**
---
Energy cost. Spending 2 talents to lower the cost by 5 (45 to 43/40)but still cost 5 more than hemo makes it inferior. They’re both going to do low damage with daggers but the debuff hemo gives and the 35 energy builds combo points faster
---
I'd stick with the rogue if you enjoy it more. There are many rogues on my server, but not nearly as many as mages and maybe even warriors. 
---
With warlock you're still gonna be competing with mages for gear.
---
You also have plenty of fallback gear options as a rogue. You compete with warriors and other rogues for the best swords, but you are the only one getting daggers and dagger specs can compete with swords especially in later tiers. 
---
Guilds that need dps will take you because rogues are close to the front of the pack numbers wise, and lock picking is useful in a lot of cases too.
---
Also rogues are fun in pvp. Cand if you're having fun, stick with it!
---
(Disclaimer, I play a rogue)
---
You think you’re joking but this is legitimately how fights started while leveling
---
I see someone coming down the road, I stealth to avoid them, they freak out and start aoeing, they get dangerously close so I have to attack and kill them, now I’ve got someone out looking for me
---
&gt;Companies are run by people too
---
No they're not, they're run by inhuman ceo's/execs who couldn't care less about stuff like this and are too busy living unsustainably luxurious lifestyles counting money.
---
&gt;doesn't mean that there isn't human behind the product
---
Workers are humans behind the product, the spoiled rich corporate execs running the show who pay dirt wages to the support team workers who are the ones handling these situations, don't qualify as human.
---
I give respect and props to workers who handle these situations with care, they are humans and good people deserving of respect, high level corporate parasites (execs/ceo/etc) that couldn't care less about the people in these situations don't get to qualify as being called "human" so don't even try it.
---
&gt;And yes, companies want to make money so their business decisions can seem very inhuman from time to time, but without the money, there's no company / online game in the first place.
---
Pick one, either you admit they're inhuman and fanatically obsessed with the profit interest, or people should be put first.
---
&gt;without the money, there's no company / online game in the first place.
---
Since "money" didn't make the game, a widespread number of workers did, citing that isn't doing anything to change the criticism of corporate behavior, and a "company" doesn't serve any purpose other than to accumulate money while pushing it's own workers lives into crisis situations like what may be going on with the person in this situation
---
How are you taking census data?
---
One of my guildies bought a few greens [of Intellect] to help with their mana pull for clearing. Over 6k mana should work swimmingly in my opinion.
---
Or just get classiccastbar and classicauraduration. That's literally all you need without cluttering the original UI up with all kind of fancy graphics
---
You don’t understand my answer. 
---
Every 60 minutes, you can reset five times. After that 60 minutes, you can reset another five times. Five times per hour. If I started a dungeon at 1:21, and for the next hour ran it five times, then my counter resets at 2:21 and I can do it another five times.
---
Nope.
---
In passive mode, you just use the attack command when you want it to hit something.  Are you thinking of trying out hunter?
---
Filthy companies and their money.
---
As a poor mage can you enlighten me or point in the direction of the video?
---
That weapon is shit on a warrior, I'd avoid the guild lmao.
---
Promote him, pay him 10s a day!
---
Take note futher mucker
---
But isn't it likely that most players will be lvl 60 by then and can find other lvl 60 items that have better stats? I'm not really sure what you mean by twink.
---
I’ve been leveling a hunter in Southshore and I’ve definitely been the aggressive one for the most part
---
Tank is just a dumbass. That's not even the chest he should be farming.
---
Oh I get what you mean, now.  5 times an hour.
---
Same here. Was killing gnolls in wetlands earlier and a mage asked me to move because this is his spot.... Get lost I'm just trying to quest
---
I absolutely admire, and am a bit envious of this photo.   The setup, the photogenic view, all of it is on another level of awesomeness!!!
---
Just simply port to moonglad before you use your hearth.
---
Gladly. This concept carries over to pretty much all classes that actively use their weapons in combat, except for Warrior Tanks who prefer a really fast Mainhand for rage building and threat purposes.
---
* It's a reference to the movie [This is Spinal Tap.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE)
---
Lol, thanks for the link here
---
HAHAHAHHAHA YOU DELETED THE REPLIES FROM YOUR ALT ACCOUNT
---
I would like to clarify that &lt;Union of Bankers&gt; on Razorgore Horde is the larger bank alt guild in this instance as we are approaching 300 bankers and growing, thus I would need to point out that your claim here is incorrect. Thank you.
---
Pathetiiiiiiiic
---
Why does the rogue in the back on the left look so surprised? ^^
---
You can put shield equip into the macro for def/battle,
---
Sucks to be a rogue as well.  Other than GY, SM is largely a big nothing for me.  At least I can do RFD now.
---
What resources? Queues don't use any resources.
---
There were (and still are in some servers at peak times) long queues, except they didn't distinguish between factions. The only difference would be that the less populated faction would have a shorter queue. So no one would have been kept away.
---
Now on servers where there are no queues, players would be kept away  - but only on that specific server and faction. They would still have the choice to play somewhere else that isn't as imbalanced.
---
That's a downside, but still preferable to having imbalanced servers. The only people who disagree are those who want an unfair PVP experience in their favour, which is pathetic.
---
I don’t attack pallies one on one just because it’s too much of a nuisance trying to kill them.
---
Minimal graphics are way better than the default look imo, lowering the alpha on the whole UI to see everything behind works great for being on move.
---
All the QoL features, priceless, they’ve only added on to them in each update.
---
Can’t convince me otherwise after using it back in Wrath and now again in classic.
---
Edit: you can also disable the minimal skins no prob and still keep all the other features, it’s fully customizable.
---
I unironically agree.
---
Fuck companies. Fuck the profit first mentality. Fuck capitalism.
---
No competent guild takes a shadow priest. You have a shadow weaving disc healer provide offensive dispels and the debuff.
---
Those addons offer some nice improvements without changing the default experience too much like a full overhaul addon as ElvUI. Customizable unit frames are useful, same for onebag addons or seeing vendor prices for items in your bags or having a custom map that give more information and doesn't cover the entire screen or damage meters and so on. :)
---
Brilliant. Bloody brilliant.
---
Haha phew!
---
I choose depending on my current class. Melees go for brown and casters for chestnut, except for rogue and warlock for which I pick black.
---
Also, use the WoWHead dressing room tool to previsualize them ;)
---
Should we tell him?
---
yea opening with ambush is very bad advice unless you're an undead rogue with perdition's blade
---
It's not a question.
---
Gnome is the master race.
---
The global cool down animation where the whole action bar goes slightly darker for 1.5 seconds? No, not without an add-on and I do not know if it exists.
---
Except this is wrong. Alliance zones were designed first, so if anything the game was Alliance biased. Horde zones were put together extremely quickly.
---
Also the Horde have barrens because the alliance have 3 level 10+ zones while the horde has 2. Silverpine and barrens.
---
IT seems imbalanced to you but it's completely fair.
---
I’ve heard it’s not bannable
---
The funny thing is that AoE power leveling/farming with mages WAS in fact a meta back when WoW launched. It's a thing mages do just to get to end game faster. It does not mean you have to though. I, personally, love speed running AoE Farm SM Cath with 4 mages and a Priest or 3 Mages a Lock and a Priest over and over and over again. The more you run it the faster your group gets and it becomes a competition to see if you can clear the instance 5 times to then get the, "You have done too many instances", message. It's a badge of honor. Full Ice Block inside Cath pull is beautiful when coordinated correctly and a lot of fun IMO.
---
This is not to say it's for everyone. We all play the game differently and while it might be a, "Meta", even though it was done back in 2006. That does not mean you have to do it. You're a mage. People are just happy to have your water and food and AI buff. When you look for a group and don't want an AoE run just state in LFG, "Mage X Level, Looking for normal NAME OF INSTANCE run". You will still get plenty of invites.
---
This is coming from personal experience.
---
That's not how statistics work.
---
There's probably been more ragnaros kills in 1 month in classic now than the entire first year and a half of vanilla.
---
Of course there's going to be more legendary drops. So many guilds are even splitting and doing 3+ molten core raids per week.
---
However you want to describe it, playing a warrior solo in PvP is not a smart idea for most people.
---
The real unsung heroes of Azeroth.
---
But I thought you lose access to your spells when you mc someone?
---
You should. Because he wasnt implying ditching felstriker. He was implying why rend MH should be used when you have Felstriker.
---
Promote this man
---
They love you in that tunnel
---
Why would you put so much stress on your healers
---
Hell yah!
---
No I’m talking about the individual spell timer. Same animation just it’s a timer for the soelm cooldown
---
YES
---
There is a huge shortage of tanks for 5 mans and you won't compete for weapons with fury warrior and rogues. People will be happy to see you tank bro.
---
yea a good warlock will just recast corruption to cover their fear.  it's not random, it removes the most recently applied effect, so they just fear -&gt; corruption and you just wasted a 2g consumable and still died.
---
Warlocks pretty much a 100% hard counter to rogues until PVP trinket in phase 2
---
I don't remember any of this AoE run business from vanilla, not sure why everyone is doing it now, other than trying to hit 60 early.
---
+1 can you share your build?
---
It’s true?
---
There's a cool down and you cannot get the buff if the head is currently up.
---
Edit: Just deleting my comment because I don't care enough at this point.
---
Last played realm in the 1.12.1 client was saved in the realmlist.wtf file and would cause you to automatically log into that realm upon launch, can’t check now because I’m at work but I can see when I get home if you can put that same line from the old client into the new one to get it to load 
---
EDIT 5:43 PM EST:
---
The variable “realmName” previously saved in the realmlist.wtf file is no longer used, and even when putting the line into config.wtf as the following;
---
SET realmName “Kirtonos”
---
The game still asks me to choose my realm when I log in. 
---
I don’t know how it is stored in the BFA client so if anyone knows that much it should read the same if we move it to the classic client, gl to anyone who can figure it out
---
You can even tank outside prot as a warrior so I don't know why all these warrirors cry about not getting tanks and people asking them to do what their class is made to. They literally rolled the tank class
---
I was questing with a mage out in EPL the other day. I asked for some water..I am a priest. Holy for raids/groups and shadow for leveling (level 58). This mage told me its 1g for 120 or I can go buy some from a vendor. I asked s couple more times and he traded me then canceled as a tease until I paid him. So he pulled, I must have not been paying attention Bc I forgot to heal him somehow, and I finished off the mobs. When he demanded a Rez, I said it would cost 1g per Rez. 
---
Needless to say that piece of work got triggered and left the group. Saw him getting camped by horde about 20 minutes later lol.
---
Try to stack up on +spell power (dreamweave set, hypnotic blade, southsea mojo boots in tanaris), +nature spell damage (anything of nature's wrath) and int. It gets better.
---
I'm level 48 now and depending on the mobs level I can kill about 4-7 before I run out of mana. However, by the time I kill those  4-7 an enhancement has killed maybe 2-3 (without lucky WF crit procs). 
---
So it balances it out and in the long run it turns out to be faster than enh, even with all the mana breaks. The only thing is that you will have to group up with mages and ask them for water right away, because it can get a bit expensive to buy drinks from vendors all the time.
---
I also got a little bit frustrated when I first transitioned, but it got better. Mobs are harder to kill once you go past lvl 40 for almost everybody with poor gear.
---
BTW, dont be afraid to use cloth gear. Try to have a nice shield and you should be fine. I dont think I'm using a single mail piece since I just can't find any with +spell power or even int.
---
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
He could be the salefish
---
On Whitemane I rarely see Alliance initiating altercations, it’s almost always Horde. Doesn’t matter if I’m alone or around other allies.
---
A lot of the Horde melee that come after me when I’m alone are shockingly bad, too. Like I end up killing them even though they have a 10+ level advantage bad. No idea what’s up with that, I guess they think rolling an orc gives them a win button in PvP or something.
---
what?!?!! FML
---
That's just a baloney justification people toss around to snake shit they don't need. "EvEryONe NeEds GoLD" is complete baloney. Loot rules has always applied to loot, not gold.
---
They’re a bit worse on druids tbh
---
Having made a number of leather goods, I am absolutely certain it will hold up a long time.  Saddle stitching and high quality vegetable tan leather will hold up for a long time.  
---
The only issue I will have is the leather being dented a bit, which is common, but I don't put my wallet in my keys pocket so this shouldn't be an issue.
---
Warlock, just to salt the wound.
---
Dominos action bars add-on should be able to do this.
---
I also do this. I see that you are a man of culture.
---
Ahahhaha

---
This is the correct glancing table for classic, and why you can see edgemasters is rather useless for orc/human. The cap for glancing is 308 skill.
---
Highest is 27 I’m not really playing much. Then 25, 25.
---
Leveling my hunter for future tranq in MC and farming capability.
---
But I do have 60G so that part is good!
---
You guys look like a chill group of friends :D loved it!
---
Moral of the story, dont be afk
---
I would much prefer succubus to voidwalker(as a rogue).  just blind the warlock once succubus starts casting then kick/vanish her seduce and kill her, then you fight the warlock 1v1 without a voidwalker shield and things are MUCH easier(altho u still will lose if the lock gets out of stun for .5 seconds)
---
Cute
---
Are there any resources you would recommend that have mostly correct information?
---
I'm talking about the buff downtime, you definitely should have some time because everyone is drinking at the beginning anyway.
---
Most don't need any more than one stack too. I use the mage water to supplement the stack of water that I already have, so one stack is usually fine.
---
750 x5 (the party buffed) = 3,750 mana. The point I'm making is that the mage and priest are both OOM at the beginning anyway, and if you have more than one mage it shouldn't be an issue to make a couple stacks of water for the party. (couple stacks, not 3 each. I've never used 60 water in a dungeon other than ZF)
---
Thanks, you too!  I went with Deviate Delight (rppvp) since I'm East coast.  Race was another detractor for me since I have no problem rping gnomes or dwarves...I don't particularly like night elves but druid versatility is trumping that I think.
---
BGs have level brackets: 10-19, 20-29, etc. A twink is a character intentionally kept in a lower bracket and geared optimally to wreck face in that bracket. A level 19 twink would not be able to use level 60 items
---
There is an Addon auctionator/auctioneer you can scan your AH and have all the prices and past prices listed on the item description.
---
hope that helped
---
In what world is hand of rag shit on warrior?  Lol Paladin propaganda
---
Level 28 on my undead warrior. Have like 45 gold from playing the auction house, so I should be able to afford a mount at 40 if what people are saying about gold gain at level ~35 is true.
---
...
---
The hammer is alright especially if you are human. Not better, but good enough. Any of them will fucking destroy until lv45+
---
Is that Ninjato in the left screen??
---
Shaman dps is a meme in pve it's a niche PvP spec only.
---
That’s true, but it will trigger the GCD when you change weapons. This really aggravates trying to interrupt.
---
In my old server back in 2006 on Onixya it was common place to do AoE runs. Does not mean everyone was broadcasting it back then in LFG though. Typically AoE runs back then were done with guild m8s and was used to power level alts/twinks. None the less AoE farming was a thing back then. It just did not get broadcasted in LFG and General as much. That also means you don't HAVE to do it as a mage. You don't. People are happy to have a mage in the group for Water, Food, AI Buff and DPS none the less. You just gotta specify in LFG now that you're looking for a normal run over a AoE farm run on X Instance. You'll still get invites. :)
---
If they don't read your LFG broadcast saying you're looking for a normal run not an AoE run then that's the party leaders falt. I love AoE Speedruns so when I get invited I always verify before starting the Instance that it's for AoE Farm. You can do the same and verify once invited that it's a normal run and not an AoE Farm run. You can also tell by the other party memebers if it's an AoE Farm run or normal run. Got 3 mages a lock and a priest or 4 mages and a priest? They are doing an AoE run. If you have a nice mixture of all classes then you're doing a normal run.
---
What's the point of a guild for bank alts?
---
"Regards, Fishstack" makes this. Haha.
---
She’s been waiting for me all these years, she’s never taken another lover. I don’t care.
---
Is worth using Slam with slow 2H, instead of Heroic Strike, while leveling (arms, 35 lv)?
---
Can we all just agree to upvote this post? OP is a mage who hands out their magewater for free and is actually wanting to run dungeons the way you're supposed to. Ie. Not rush in and spellcleave everything.
---
We need more mages like this. 
---
Note: Before any mages get on my case about the whole charging for magewater thing all I gotta say is as a Warlock I am EXPECTED to grind soul shards and create health stones for everyone. Not to mention soulstones for the healers and summoning rituals yet I never charge  anyone. All magewater costs is mana... which you can get back from drinking your own water that you make. It literally costs you nothing to make other then the time you would be standing around outside a dungeon.
---
That's the table for nostalrius, not classic.  
---
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26495604/58601852-90e81900-8282-11e9-9684-b0ffcf5f9434.png is the correct table
---
Easier if you mean that you can swap to DPS and people won't bitch at you for not tanking. Sure. But tanking wise, warrior is best.
---
My first toon was a priest and I loved it. This time around I'm a shaman and when I tried a priest alt, I just couldn't get back into it. I'm might try again, but the same magic just wasn't there after 11 years.
---
It totally makes sense now. thanks a lot!
---
Facts
---
Just hit 40 on my main 5 minutes ago. 37g to my name. Happy to get my level 40 talent but I'll be walking for a while yet!
---
A shuffle as you call it still has a time cost, and more importantly often a locked profession cost as well. One could easily see the price difference between raw and completed materials being that. Though also sometimes raw materials are more expensive for easy leveling recipes.
---
thats why u blind the warlock and KILL the pet
---
I can confirm that there is a 2 hour wait until another head can be placed. You can also turn in the head in a different layer if it doesn't have one up already. Good luck min/maxing my friend.
---
Are paladins who use sword and shield viable for everything? PvP, dungeons, raids?
---
This macro will check if you have a shield equipped. If you have a shield equipped in defensive or battle stance we can just cast shield bash, so no need to change to berserker stance. If you don't have a shield equipped in defensive or battle stance, it will also change to berserker stance in order to pummel.
---

Is there a lot of locks horde side? Trying to decide between lock and rogue and lock seems appealing if the population of them is low
---
Do you expect to be tipped when giving your dungeon healer water? Then tip the healer for every heal they throw on you. I can understand being spammed by requests in city or from random but this topic is about conjuring water to your dungeon group and I sincerely hope you realize you're supposed to conjure water for the other mana users without expecting any tips, especially the healer.
---
I beg to differ.
---
That sentence makes you rationally angry, as is your (our) good right.
---
At times, I get embarrassed for having rolled a mage based on all the hate were getting on Reddit. Then I read messages like this and can't believe there's mages out there that won't supply their groups with water. Like ffs when I run mc I don't show up without at least 600 water in my bags and in dungeons I'm happy to supply any consumables needed and one if not more portals free of charge.
---
I guess this is why I don't have my epic mount though haha. I don't think mages realize how much they can impact someone's day by just offering randoms food and water. Some of my best experiences so far have been stopping to give a random player food and water. To my fellow mages if you haven't experienced the joy of a solo warrior leveling after you've given him food and intellect (so he can train his weapon skills faster) you haven't lived at all.
---
print key on keyboard. Default wow screenshot button
---
I was the huntard that needed on all 2h weapons with on hit procs like ravager. Never wore leather gear after I unlocked mail even if it was better.  Never trained my pet well. Still somehow got Blackstone ring.
---
He’s farming for an item, drop it already
---
Twink is a character specifically made for low lvl pvp. You feed the character a ton of gold and items so they are as good as possible for their bracket(lvl19-29-39 etc). So with phase 3 the best gear for lv 19's gets really expensive including shadow fang.
---
For some reason my succubus has never been blinded in world PvP. I don't think many of the rogues leveling understand the seduce mechanics.
---
Cisco Finesse
---
Yeah but more layers increase total population cap, blizz even confirmed it in the blue post.
---
I could clear the stockade myself at level 38?
---
You newbs are so cute. 
---
&gt;Who the fuck cares about min/maxing in pve
---
The fact you imply I was talking about pve is adorable.
---
I think you might be on to something!
---
I think it’s more likely you and OP have attitude or some other issue that is leading to the problem.
---
I don’t see what the problem is, he’s literally choosing not to bring you cause you will roll on his drops. 
---
Don’t see what the big deal is here, except that you’re being a baby about it.
---
RIP your livers.
---
Trolls joined the horde because the horde rescued them from a bunch of murlocs when they first went to Kalimdor.
---
Similarly, Tauren joined because the horde rescued a young Baine from centaurs.
---
got mine first run at lvl 57, is u mad?
---
Are you trolling? Why would you use The Untamed Blade in a phase where Ashkandi and BRE exists?
---
So the timer to reset 5 dungeons starts after the 5th reset?
---
You can clear MC in greens and blues.

Posting a screenshot on reddit takes literally 3 seconds and you don't even need to pull out your phone.

---
you can clear all this shit without being so try hard about racials you know?

I assume since you dont show pages on screenshots you either mixed em up or are trolling cuz thats now how it works right?
---
no it’s been like 7?

&gt;Every set of tier gear was designed to take months to get. You can't get your entire tier 1 or tier 2 in 1 or 2 weeks, for instance. T0 is the same. Classic was always about the journey, not destination. Take your time and enjoy the game. You will get your t0 and pre-raid BiS eventually by doing enough Scholo, UBRS, LBRS, Strat, BRD, Mara, Dire Maul etc.
---
Everything you just said was just plain wrong. We have a druid in our guild who had full T1 gear our second week of doing MC. I had my full T0 gear 2 days after hitting 60. You can absolutely take your time and enjoy the game but that doesn't mean you can't also gear up insanely quickly if that is how you enjoy playing.
---
&gt; Shaman dps is a meme in pve it's a niche PvP spec only.
---
https://i.imgur.com/j2qoOFJ.png
---
Every spec brings utility to the raid. Meme specs is a term people use when they don't understand game mechanics.
---
Makes sense
---
I see this and can't help be a little grumpy considering we never saw a single eye drop in over a year of running MC.
---
I’m not saying you have to call the police or an ambulance. But tell a friend who is closer. Tell their parents you are worried. Tell a teacher you’re concerned.
---
I assumed because I didn't think anyone was dumb enough to believe hand of rag is a bad warrior pvp weapon.
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should spend 1000g on *movespeed* when it literally doesnt even help you in battle, at all
---
What others have said and also, time it well and you can vanish dodge the deathcoil. After that kick gouge stun everything
---
dude weapon skill is soooo fucking good, have you ever played a rogue or fury warrior at any point in WoW?
---
Level 49 is next
---
Try to get in a sm cath aoe spamming group. Did that from 36 to 40 made like 50-60g. Crazy good xp too.
---
That's why you have officer chat
---
this isnt discord mate.
---
Great :) I understand now
---
It’s true though. Whenever I see a mage/warlock/hunter farming or mining in the open world I get mad. You have the best most Op way of making gold and instead you are fighting people for scraps, it’s really fucking stupid
---
5 an hour and the hour starts the moment you walk inside the first instance ID. Literally the moment you walk in. The hour does not start when you reset the first instance, like everyone else is telling you.
---
Criminally underrated comment
---
It doesn’t work
---
I think what the other person and a lot of people  here is saying, but struggling to get across well is;
---
You can farm really well against certain types of mobs that drop a lot of greens and cloth.  You could probably farm these much smoother than water mobs, and get your gear a lot faster by buying the items off the ah after a bit of farming elsewhere
---
Got to level 22 last night on my rogue.  Hit 16 in the first day then wasn’t able to play again till Friday.   Probably won’t get another chance till Thursday Friday this week.   Wishing I had more time cause I’m addicted again.
---
The fact you think I was talking about PvE goes to show how clueless you are lmao.
---
frankly I did this back in vanilla :) but uh check with your raid leader/guild. as long as you complete boss mechanics you should be fine, forget if there are any hard dps checks until bwl
---
on the p server I had that frost wand from azuregos, that was so fucking legit but now I don't see myself winning any loot at all much less something truly epic.
---
You may reset 4 times.
---
You must be your raid's Winter's Chill ma.... oh.
---
Insider trading is something else.   It's when someone knows that a company planning to do something that will significantly change that company's value, and buys and sells stock in that company before that action is publicly announced.  For example if Nistel92 was going to sell guild leadership to someone else, and you knew this fact and bought stock so you would get a larger cut.
---
Yeah look at the xp you're getting from quests. A lot of the time it's just 2-3k and some money. You could easily just grind a dozen mobs and have the same xp gain.
---
Thralls resolve is best for mitigation, Nagelring for AoE (also best mitigation for ally) and Blackstone is decent for threat.
---
It’s literally an instance you can farm you stupid mage
---
That is a duck.
---
Not in my guild, maybe when you do MC / ony in p2 or close to it, sure. I personally wouldnt wanna raid with a bad spec but hey. Nice way to do it is to raid teuesdays and wednesdays, gives loads of time for off-specs and pvp
---
Cringy af
---
Higher level depending on bombs!
---
who would even know how many guilds were getting tfury in vanilla? you would just play on your server and have no idea what goes on on most other servers unless they had something special there like death and taxes
---
Holy shit... Ive never had it happen to me- i guess im lucky
---
I got pretty burnt out at 50 - literally just sat at 50 for maybe 10 days not wanting to play since my mates gave up way before that and i didn't have anyone to play with.
---
What changed my mind (i'm 59 atm, a week after deciding to play again) - find a guild! Find people to do stuff with, the game becomes way more fun when you're chilling with friends in dungeons etc.
---
That looks amazing.
---
Finally a unambiguous reply :p thanks
---
woah this guy's thinking in 4d. Most people assume shit quality = authentic vanilla but this guy outsmarted em.
---
druids are loving this
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should spend 1000g on items when it literally doesn't even help in the world, at all
---
In case you're going for that though, be sure to have a lot of free bag space as these spam groups are usually doing quite a lot of runs
---
Bank alt battle royale, I can  get behind that idea.
---
Okay let's take a step back here.
---
This is similar to why people think they can win the Lotto.
---
Here's the analogy that helped put it into perspective for me.
---
Let's say there are a bunch of trees in a valley. And a thunderstorm ahead. What are the chances that if you chose one tree, it would be hit twice in a row?
---
It seems statistically improbable for sure.
---
Now, let's say you don't have to pick a tree. What are the chances that one of the trees in the pack gets hit twice? It's a hell of a lot higher.
---
tldr: There's a TON of guilds doing end-game content by now. Some of these guilds even have alt-runs going already. It's not insane for ONE of the guilds to have two rare drops. If there were a bunch of them getting hands of rag all over the place THEN I'd be suspicious.
---
I think you're mistaken. I'm not looking for something like diablo. If anything, I don't want anything like diablo as ... it's just clearing waves and waves of mobs in hope of better loot. Solo. I want something that has party mechanics. Warriors pulling mobs. Mages casting AOEs and trying not to draw too much aggro. Healers trying to keep the party alive. That sorta thing.
---
Idk, most MMORPGs seems to be solo solo solo. Maybe at max level there will be group based content like.. idk. dungeons and raids and pvp. But often I'm unwilling to go through that grind alone (its a waste of time IMO when I have access to so many other great games.) I grew up playing games like tibia where there was open-world PVP. And partied in 12 man parties in Ragnarok Online and played their version of guild wars every weekend. After which I moved on to MOBAs and when I came back to MMORPGs, I couldn't find any game that gave me those kind of experiences anymore.
---
But they do by allowing more poeple at once on a server.
---
So the hardest hitting weapon in the game is not good for arms warriors?
---
And ur gonna get your pee pee smacked going through the tunnel
---
Gnome is better for pvp. Getting rooted reeeeally sucks.
---
as a mt in TBC this makes my balls cringe. I think my story is even worse though, my guild couldn't make it past mother for some reason... even though we cleared hyjal lmao. so I just kind of quit raiding because I didn't want to wake up at 8pm or whatever time raids started
---
Insider trading would require these bank alts to know some price-impacting info the rest of the market doesn't, and profit from it. Privatly negotiated transactions like these are more akin to dark pools since they don't go through the AH.
---
If I was group lead, I’d like to kick someone for that.
---
Ah ok, I play Alliance, didn't realise it was different.
---
What are these "daisies" and where did you get them?  By using the word bouquet they sound like a kind of vegetation non native to azeroth.  This will need to be quarantined and studied.  In the meantime I'd suggest a bouquet of peacebloom.  
---
As you know,  We at the Azeroth Center Decease Control (ACDC for short) are known to help protect the world from a variety of biological threats by our expert team of undead musicians.
---
I find Elvui to be clunky, I always get LUA errors, and I'm constantly having to /reload ui because things get stuck on the UI and won't go away (I'm looking at you, tangy clam meat). 
---
I'm currently looking to replace it.
---
That's not really true.  Most raid instances require at least 2 OT, if not more depending on the encounter (especially when you get to AQ/Naxx).
---
Tis but a flesh wound!
---
Do you have a guild on your shaman maybe you can get some dps runs in with them if they got heals? I would be annoyed to feel the need to change play style just for content, but I have no hybrid classes atm so my time may come for that when I roll druid lol
---
Challenging yourself with time trial like runs of dungeons does sound like a fun thing to do with a group of non rage friends :p
---
When I played vanilla the highest I got was level 29 on a troll rogue so I really didn't have end game exp to know what kinds of sneaky tricks people had.
---
Making food/water stacks and announcing my location on /1 is the first thing I do when I log on usually haha it's fun to be helpful, I even save horde sometimes, but occasionally it gets me killed cause they think me sheeping them whwn they are on 5% hp so they regen fast js a gank attempt and call their friends XD
---
This is the first thing posted on reddit so I think 10 upvotes is plenty :p also Idk how to reply to actual comments so this addresses all that I saw
---
These water mobs aren't immune to frost like others. They are very easy to kill. Look I don't know why people are getting so upset. If I wanna farm something I'm gonna farm it, I don't care about max speed or anything like that. I'm just playing the game yo. People thinking I should be segregated because I'm a mage is beyond me TBH.
---
That says more about your own intelligence than that of anyone else.
---
My bank alt named Voodoobank approves.

Hey so like we need you to go into this super dangerous ziggurat and kill a lich. Ohh btw thatll be 100g to do that for us.
---
Yes your right about not hitting glancing blows  but actually I believe the soft cap is at 310 . Not 305. I’ve used them in MC and UBRS. I don’t know man cause I have them in game and have tested them and the difference is huge it’s very noticeable.
---
I am going to stick with my guns and still say they are the best in slot for warriors any race and class on mobs  60+.
---
There's Stockades as well as Blackfathom deeps and Shadowfang keep - the latter two are a bit out of the way though and might be tricky to find a group for.
---
Start running Stormwind Stockade, you’re at the right level now and it’s usually pretty easy to find a group there.

The Motorola Razr came out in July 2004. More than likely you would take pictures and show them to your friends in real life, not through social media.
---
Imo leveling on a pvp realm MUST be done in a pvp spec. Raiding tho... Well, depends, people can certainly carry you if they will to.
---
not everyone knew where all the quests were back then.
---
This 100%. If I have half a bar to 55 I can look on the map and find a nice little hub of quests.
---
I'm now realizing that I'm finding hubs of quests I never explored back in the day.
---
Skookum as frig
---
I’m not sure if you’re trolling or actually mental wtf
---
I don't think the default ui will do it.  Might be an addon that'll add it to the nameplate
---
Ok, I understand better now. It's this weird thing where I totally understand I play way more than the average player, but a substantial portion of my time was spent carrying friends who didn't take vacation through dungeons and whatnot. I don't even necessarily care that they consider me a hardcore player. The problem is that the people who do that are also the same people who would have been posting in this sub that I'm such a great part of the community because I gaved out probably 50+ bags (anywehere from (6-12 slots) to random players in the first few zones, while on reddit implying I'm the type of player that is ruining the game because I'm so "hardcore". It was fun to give shit away, and I've received tons of whispers from players who I gave bags to, because I told them they should not sell their bags and pass them on to other players, like I did. I bought wands for low level casters. All sorts of shit. I don't necessarily have a point, I just despise those judgemental people.
---
I’ve been looking EVERYWHERE for a vertical monitor like that an a 2 monitor arm. Would you mind sharing what monitor that is? Thanks!
---
Yeah you fit the profile of mage players perfectly. “Fuck other people, got mine”
---
&gt; The point is that farming is something that is just not fun.
---
For you. Don't try to dictate what is and is not fun for other people until it threatens to ruin the experience for someone else.
---
You are a smart man everyone else is the fool. I hate getting Whispers from people telling me I'm playing the game wrong fuck off and let me do what I want to do I don't care if there's a better way maybe I like this way
---
“This video was filmed last minute” you literally have all the time in the world to film it there’s no time constraint whatsoever
---
I’m still struggling to find a class to level, I’ve tried mage, warlock, priest, paladin and shaman. May give rogue a go tonight, or maybe hunter. Not really rushing at all though I’ll get there eventually.
---
Nice assumption lol
---
Don’t use heroic strike. Spam sunders. Heroic strike eats rage, the heroic strike attack doesn’t generate rage and it replaces your auto. Sunder will trigger more overpowers and the stacking armor reduction will outweigh the bonus damage from heroic strike.
---
Then it would better  to use the gloves and use swords as an Orc. Since there are better sword we’ll this changes everything guess I can use axe of the deep wounds as a MH and a way better off hand than serathil. Looking at these most of the testers weren’t even 60

And yes they where run in beta they put that note there for a reason man. How many of the testers had edgemaster handguards available to them  how many of them where human or orcs there is way to many variables.

He’s not asking if it was in vanilla, he’s asking if they should be in this phase of vanilla
---
Why is his name green for his rolls?
---
Yeah, the sweet spot is 30 seconds. If things are dying faster, you're wasting mana, but if battles take 30+ seconds you top the dps tracker by a long shot
---
I don't know where you are getting that in getting upset over this post :) I'm perfectly fine just bought my epic mount off selling those sweet essence of water and got some nice warrior tears along the way!
---
What a ridiculous, polar extreme way to interpret an offhand comment.
---
,
---
This! It's not even that I'm worried for their health. I know a mage can solo an elite melee mob by kiting. The issue is that without enemies hitting the tank, the tank just sits and auto attacks.
---
DPS please let us be hit so we can play the game too.
---
Kinda same with illidan getting his eyes burned out in war of the ancients.. described very vividly
---
Before 36, spam sunder
---
At 36 use whirlwind
---
At 40 use mortal strike and whirlwind
---
Slam gets pushed back like casting a spell and you should rarely have the obscene amounts of excess rage to make heroic strike worth it
---
I was just thinking the other day that if the game had some mechanics to enforce loans/debt, it wouldn't be too long before everyone was a slave to some mega-bank.
---
Either auto deducts from your gold stack or bounties to loot what you owe.
---
I don't even have a blue. Then again I'm level 30 and haven't done any raids. People seem really eager to reach the end but it's not a race everyone is trying to win
---
And that's why I said MOST of those zones give about one level of xp. He listed 11 zones, he has a bit over 14 levels to go and I rounded it to 12 levels of xp wich brings him to about 2 levels off without dungeons.
---
My point was just that what people say about not having enough xp from quests alone to get to 60 is proven and accurate. But everyone I know mixes in dungeons and they usually end up running them more than once for an item so majority of players will hit 60 and still have quests to do
---
Gyzmoduck?
---
Not waste 10k of guild resources, especially on something they are going to replace LMAO.
---
I levelled in vanilla as prot up to about 45, and it was brutal. I tanked many dungeons without stance dancing.
---
I'm levelling my classic warrior as arms, but still tanking a lot. I have macros set up so I can use every ability in every stance, it switches for me automatically. My opening pull is berserker rage (berserker stance), charge (battle stance), whirlwind with a 2 hander (berserker stance), switch to sword and shield, defensive stance, demo shout, and then a normal rotation from there.
---
I'm using ALL the tools now.
---
This will be very helpful, thank you!
---
I had the same thing happen! Only reason I made it was because I was mounted.
---
Closer to the enchanting trainer.
---
First time in WoW and absolutely love it. Lvl 32 Priest following a levelling guide from Icy-Vein’s, but I created an Alt for LW and Enchanting on the advice of some early in game, now I’ve been hit with the ‘Level 20’ to learn expert LW for my Shaman. 
---
Any tips on what I need to help level a Shaman. Have all these totems and stuff and feel lost.
---
Since there is no guild banks in vanilla, you would have to manually keep track of all items and donations with spreadsheets or other notes to keep track of everything. It is a very time consuming and usually thankless. But it has been done.
---
&gt;I think you're maybe getting a little worked up.  
---
Lol you realize that if someone was actually getting worked up this would be the dead wrong thing to say right?

You could offer a character item transfer service. Where someone can approach your members and for 1g, give them some items to hold while they log into an alt to get it. So this is a global service, but also a member benefit.
---
Read title again :P
---
100% justified. Enjoy your ban! :)
---
Copied for relevance:
---
I try to explain to DPS to let me round up a pack or 2 around a corner, once they're in a pile give me 2 gcds to swipe or whatever and bam. 5 seconds into a pull, all the mobs are neatly stacked in one spot ready to die. Some people don't listen, but after I explain my intention as above quickly, most people get it.
---
Yeah I'm level 45 and have about 3 gold
---
no changes :)
---
This is along the lines of what I was looking to hear. Thank you
---
He was a warrior I'm not talking about you.
---
Nice little breakdown, thanks! :D
---
There is when you don't live in the same area as your friends and you're visiting them for a weekend
---
And here I am prot pally tanking dungeons just fine.
---
I don't know if I truly count as casual, due to the amount of time I spend online. But I really couldn't care less about effective levelling and am just as likely to be found in a capital city trying to level professions or browsing the AH for fun stuff.
---
I have two characters at level 30 and a handful between 10 and 20. I still don't know which one I would consider my "main." Still having a blast, though!
---
Oh, no, sorry. I mean sell all your greens on the ah/vendor until you start getting level 40+ equipment drops, meaing your character is past level 40. 
---
If you're impatient and want to start enchanting before that point, buy your ench materials from the ah.
---
Im doing it as a resto shaman. Gotta grind mats for tribal leatherworking. Yeah it takes forever.
---
The horde has the advantage, but since alliance has 2 fp there it evens it out a bit.  Not by much since the second fp is of marginal utility, but a bit.
---
I started enchanting and tailoring as mage. Dropped enchanting after lvl 75 cause I was sinking gold in it. Got skinning and maxed it out fairly quickly. Now I’m farming devilsaur leather as a lvl 53 mage. Sold 4 for 30g the other day and another 2 for 14g
---
Targeted harassment.
---
Shooting bolts of frost are going to make some things crack and shatter.
---
I would avoid using either, there is actually a larger benefit using Sunder Armor. It not only reduces the armor of your target to increase dmg of autoattacks but counts as a seperate attack so it can proc overpower which is super strong and cheap. Also when using HS you lose the ability to gain rage off those seperate autoattacks. Slam will be only beneficial if you are using a weapon with a slower attack speed then 3.00, and that is only in comparison to HS. I recently switched over to Sunder myself at lvl 37 and see a huge difference wish i started sooner.
---
fortunately (?) there's no guild bank or any sort of other material assets associated with guild ownership in classic so the worst thing someone could really do by infiltrating a guild to officer rank is kick a bunch of people.
---
Now back to you, Ollie. IM AT THE WRONG AIRPORT!
---
If you're getting that upset about it just play mage. Then you can feel free to aoe farm all the dungeons you want!
---
Usually a lot more to all these posts.
---
I just tanked 8/10 Mc as a druid, Mt for about half I'd say due to plans or a warrior death. Zero issues. Maul is way more threat than a warrior can do in blues, and I have 13k armor with inspiration in half prebis half leveling blues.
---
It doesn't disconnect you unless you are afk for 30 minutes.
---
Gold ramps up from questing after 40. The item rewards and gold given gets much higher. 
---
I had to wait until 42 to get my mount, but then I made it all back pretty quickly.
---
Spamming instances can do it, even though Silk isn't as valuable as it was. Between slik, Grey drops, and blue drops from dungeons, you could just farm dungeons.
---
Yep, you deserve it.
---
I was prob just going to make some easy gear from tailoring and ench it.
---
see i like to do things fast but your reply @laspyra is exactly why i say what i say. this game isnt just for one group of people its an amazing world with plenty of different types of people fast, slow, pvp, pve, RP. there will never be a time where everyone plays world of warcraft the same way. if they did it probably wouldnt be fun anymore.
---
Isn't it pvp? Can someone explain to me why he was banned?
---
Oh noes, a frostard put me on ignoooore!
---
Doing us all a favor by ignoring half the server, kid.
---
Yes, except in Hillsbrad the horde again has the advantage of a good, centrally located town near major roads.  Alliance are higher level but questing there is way easier for horde.
---
You sound like you get upset easily. Its just a game lol
---
Only people that should ever be pulling that aren't the tank are in some situations where you need to pull with CC, where you want a hunter to pull to kite a mob to a trap easier, or some other select situations that require a quicker pull (i.e. hunter rank 1 arcane shots as they are instant).
---
Unless you know everyone, the pace they can handle, and have cleared this qith the group ahead of time, DPS shouldn't be setting any sort of a pace. If they are altering the pace dictated by the tank and/or healer then find DPS with a few brain cells.
---
Only time I, as a hunter, have pulled ahead of a tank is when I know ahead of time that this is how we want to progress and handle things as a group (i.e. picking up single patrolling mobs at opportune times in UD strat when we have one or two mobs left to whittle down). If I did that crap whilly-nilly I sure as shit deserve to not be invited back to any groups.
---
It's also profoundly important for DPS to remember that, in most situations, DPS spam is not as important as maintaining control and keeping things steady. Speed is the name of the game in Retail, but very rarely what wins fights in Classic outside of some PvP encounters. Hunters have a problem accepting that they need to not multi-shot in many situations to make sure they don't break CC. Granted, a skilled hunter often can and should find a safe LOS they can use Multi from without hitting the CC'd mob, but in the event they cannot, they should just resort to weaving Aimed Shot and Auto Attacks. Your DPS is not worth releasing a sheeped mob who will then charge your healer, silence them, and punt them into a pack of mobs that were skipped over, causing a wipe.
---
Not to mention nearly every leveling instance favors horde.
---
I’m not weepin ‘cause you won’t be here to hold my hand. For your information there’s an inflammation in my tear gland
---
DPS is an end result of playing good. You play the game to excel at it.
---
You do not play the game to jerk off DPS. You can jerk of playing like a beast - which puts you on dps #1
---
Thottbot and other tracking addons were available that early so we have SOME data, although far from comprehensive. Although all I’ve found so far list it at 3% dr
---
You can only have one weapon enhancement active at a time per weapon.  This goes for totems, selfbuffs, poisons and other one use items.
---
Your totem will buff you if u as a shaman dont have a selfbuff active atm. But your selfbuffs are stronger then the totem  effects

Usually, but it seems like I got a random dc. Was getting a drink and having a piss.... Took at most 10 minutes. I was hoping that I can right log back in like when you reconnect right after a dc, but it seemed like it was too long for this...
---
Gratz!
---
That's absolutely stunningly beautifull, though would be better without that guy talking
---
I think I know what you mean, but what's a tryhard?
---
I'm not as passionate about this as parent comment, but here's my attempt since no one else has tried to give you a decent answer and instead just downvoted you for asking a question.
---
* It removes parts of the default UI (such as the large faceplates for self and focus in the upper left).
---
* It adds parts to the UI that are superflous to a new player, such as the damage meter ("Damage Taken") in the bottom right.
---
* It adds a swing timer, which is used for min-maxing and is just a distraction to a new player.
---
* It makes the chat background invisible, placing text on the world. The default makes the chat stand out from the world and easier to read.
---
* The action bar is minimalist. The default makes it obvious for a new player that buttons go at the bottom, and has a grid with dividers between each button, this makes it easier to avoid misclicking on an ability that is butted up directly against another ability.
---
* The XP bar was moved from the bottom to the top and the colors were changed and the obvious dividers were removed and replaced with a gradient. The addon provides value by giving an estimate of how long it will take to level, something irrelevant to a new player (especially one who is not a gamer).
---
So most of these addons are fine if you choose them for yourself, but for a new player (non gamer) they don't help as much as they would for a seasoned player, and many of them detract from the experience.
---
It got five points! Also I checked before posting if it had been posted already but clearly did not check hard enough.
---
Keep smilin, sister! :D
---
If you look at videos instead of playing them, you won't know how they FEEL as a class. It's probably better to try them out and see if you like them. This will require investment, no one can tell you what you'll like.
---
peroid
---
Yeah I noticed lol. It was not what I expected. Can you kill bosses at lvl 40 in rfd?
---
I have no doubt they drink stout.
---
Some people need to drink or hit the restrooms.... I am not Cartman
---
Let's also not forget that they have zeps that go between undercity, orgrimmar, and gromgol base camp. Alliance has to fly to wetlands, wait forever for a boat, ride to theramore, then fly to where they were actually going when we cross continents. I thought it fucking sucked to have to bind to kargath when I played horde in vanilla but MAN does getting around as alliance suck ass sometimes in classic.
---
Ohh ok I didnt know this.
---
You can tank 5 mans easily with any spec
---
I think you're the one getting worked up here. Why are you so concerned with how someone else wants to play the game?
---
I'm the opposite: played alliance as a child and switched to horde when I got older. Alliance appealed to me more because they have prettier races and cities. As I got older the horde lore and stories were more appealing.
---
A lot of times as soon as you stop focusing the one mob, you lose aggro on it.  Oh man and then the other one you were trying hold aggro on loses threat and runs to the hunter 30 yards away, who runs further away, while you've got a slow debuff on you and no rage cus nothings attacking you and oh god everyone's yelling and running around.
---
Maybe I faked it :O
---
Pay to win
---
Ah, so the weapon based totems still count as weapon enhancements then? So if I did lay down a windfury and had rockbiter on, nothing would happen then?
---
You just admitted to using a known bug to avoid guards. Fucking lol. There’s literally been dozens of posts about this. Just don’t do it. Get banned kid.
---
You should roll need on all BoEs anyways. But ye kickin ninjas is the way to go
---
Yeah, usually you don’t want your entire screen(s) captured. I don’t at least. Unless it’s for a boss kill, or like a cinematic type thing.
---
I see mages all the time as DPS in a normal group
---
Pretty simple to understand. Gadget has a bunch of terrain exploits so griefing players in that area is a no no. Instead you just look like a total noob killing people in Gadget, even if this isn't 100% a terrain exploit. Enjoy your ban, hope they change this shit and make the guards more aggressive
---
Err, 30% vs 60% is "hardly faster"? Good luck surviving in classic if you think you don't need a mount because u can just dungeon only. That'll work while u level, but not at 60.
---
It should do that on the second press of the button. On the first press it puts you in Defensive Stance, then on the second press you are indeed in Defensive Stance and so the /equip parts work. 
---
You can remove the [stance:2] parts in the /equip lines to have it work with a single press. But if you do that, it will also try to equip your 1H and Shield when you go into Battle Stance.
---
Guild standing comes from raid progression kills and pvp ranks, nothing else.  Hand of Rag is a meme.
---
In router log wasn't a dc and I got a wired connection. Seems strange to me.
---
Lol, I like how you think people with jobs are the losers.  Enjoy your basement.
---
The math is known. Anyone who suggests ideal is 315 weapon skill has no credibility in this conversation. Stop contributing misinformation
---
Everything in this game will be replaced. And what are you saving resources for? The extremely difficult progression in BWL?
---
I’m not sure what game I’m thinking of but, I’ve heard of developers having to artificially “randomize” things because players were thinking the actual random selection wasn’t random enough.
---
Rofl the dude killing low levels via something close to a terrain exploit is talking shit?! We all know the reason you grief in Gadget is you get walked all over in real PvP
---
Totally new to me this is nice thank you

Happy wife happy life is something that counts for girlfriends too.

Mind sharing the name of the addon you are using for your ui? Looks amazing! Ty
---
Actually all my friends from back then are here. So no, server transfer is not an option for a couple of 100 people.
---
I get a combination. People are grateful but refuse to let me captain the ship. Wand and throw pulls left and right, not a chance of holding threat on more than one to two before everything is scattered to the winds...
---
...aah, it's good to be back.
---
i have heard that 1 defense =0.04% block parry dodge miss each and has 0.04 less chance to get critted by mobs.
---
but when i look on to my 50lvl character with 250 defense dodge parry rates are no near to10% it is even around 5%
---
is that formula wrong? or how should i calculate
---
What is your goal with the game? Do you plan on raiding as feral? Do you just want to PvP? Or do you just want to "grind mobs" forever? The Devilsaur set is very good for you if you plan on DPS'ing in raids as feral. Also, if you're trying to find dungeon groups as feral, you really should just tank. Not many people want a feral DPS in dungeons. Are you not comfortable tanking, or just don't feel like it? Sorry if I sound like a dick, I just find your post kind of confusing.
---
To actually answer your question, the most important items for a feral DPS druid are Wolfshead Helm (from AH) and Manual Crowd Pummeler (Gnomeregan). Outside of that, either buy "of the Tiger" or Shadowcraft gear from the AH or start tanking dungeons.
---
Not 315 . I don’t even know how you hit 315. Talking 312 racial + handguards. Soft cap is at 310.
---
*subjective
---
I beg your pardon, I always ask first and I always tip (although not in dungeons obviously). I also consider it rude as fuck to just open trade and not say anything.
---
I never have trouble getting water because I always ask politely, but I would consider it extremely odd if I didn’t receive any (in a dungeon. In a city is a different story.)
---
That what I noticed, too. Most German servers were free to join on Thursday, but now all but one were full.
---
Mother was the single worst fight in the whole expansion. We literally called it a 'dice roll' every time, because the tank could just get parry gibbed out of nowhere. And this is with a guild in absolutely full endgame gear clearing it just for more Glaives/Shield/Trinket from Illidan.
---
We ended up with a Rogue in 100% dodge gear (with the 1% flat dodge chance you couldn't remove taken care of by Cheat Death.. hopefully) tanking it towards the end of the expansion and everyone fucking off the Shadow Resist just to kill it ASAP.
---
You are acting like DKP is drama free, when I have heard countless stories of DKP manipulation and other shady stuff
---
Loot council is just far superior
---
He was bug abusing to avoid guards. Blizz has been very clear about handing out bans for this.
---
A 60 hunter on my server (Incendius) was banned for using aimed shot to insta-kill people from the top of the arena cage in the middle of Gadgetzan last week. Just because this dude says he’s not on buildings doesn’t mean he’s not like walking on top of a bucket or terrain or something to bug out guards. He claims to be just line of sighting them. Always more to the story.
---
I thought it was minecraft bow sounds
---
You can tank anything except raids as any of the warrior specs tbh. I would suggest sticking with 2H weapons until end game though, DW is going to be difficult to get your full DPS potential until late game where as 2H you will be tanking and outputting the most damage in your dungeon groups for a while between levels 35-50ish which is a good feeling. :P
---
That being said, the importance of picking up your protection abilities for tanking in dungeons is very important! You should try and be in defensive stance the majority of the time for the increase threat generation and your taunt for those "oh shit" moments when you lose threat on something that is now hacking at your healer or intimidating shout. Switch to berserker stance for Berserker Rage to increase rage generation and battle stance for Cleave combos to empty your rage bar when needed. If you have difficulty holding threat putting a few stacks of sunder armor on each mob will keep them in check or switching to battle stance for a few thunder claps helps as well.
---
There are guild standings, go look at Warcraft logs.  Guild progression, speed, execution, dps, etc is all ranked.  I don't know about you, but I like to be in the guilds that actually clear MC in an hour or less right now, not 3-4 hours.
---
I used agility gear on my LV 30 warlock to do more right click DMG. Life was hard.

My computer also crashed when loot windows opened.

The census addon has not worked since 9/19 so that website is pointless. Even when it did work it only counted players with the addon and many didnt have it (my alliance guild of well over 100 active members only had a handful of players with the addon).

Only Blizzard knows the actual population numbers and they will never release them.

Here’s an ez macro:

Some people just cannot move. All those old school peeps from back then went on the German Pvp server when there was just one option and reserved their name here. Even with guaranteed name keeping most wouldn't want to move.
---
Maybe the fake goes even deeper, it could be a mannequin to cover up that I'm single.
---
Usually. But this time I got a full dc.
---
This is why I loved maiming a gnome rogue in vanilla. Throw in some Noggenfogger, and just wait inside that carcass they made for their next pull.
---
Most guilds in current wow and private servers use loot council. You are just one of the old boomers that still thinks DKP is a good system (spoiler alert:it’s not)
---
God tier until normalization.
---
What does that accomplish? Lol just delays the inevitable.
---
Eh, I totally get where OP is coming from. I'm leveling as shadow priest and have healed most of my dungeons and it's usually a 50/50 between a good group that meshes really well or a bad group with giant pulls and threat going all over the place. And usually it's a "tank" with ravager making me drink after every pull because they can't be arsed to put on a shield and a mage pulling too many, too early, and too often in failed attempts to AoE kite. 
---
Also like OP I've even gotten in the last spot as a DPS only for the group to kick the guy who joined as a healer followed by a "you can heal, right?" with full expectation that I'd just heal it for them.
---
Was that bacardi 151? How are you alive?

I thought customise and race change were, and maybe faction change? Could be totally wrong

And tiptoeing through a dungeon at half the speed you could be going isn't fun.  
---
Sitting in one spot and pressing one button isn't fun.  
---
Don't call it emergent gameplay, but based on the amount of people doing it in game and the amount of complaints from the, "I wish everyone were as bad as me," crowd on this subreddit, I'd say a lot of people feel the exact same as I do.
---
To me this seems like a difference between people that have been playing the game for over 10 years and those that are new.  It's just so annoying coming here every day and seeing people complain about how everyone else is playing the game, rather than doing any sort of introspection into how they can improve themselves.
---
I’d say it’s more for comedic timing but you do you.
---
Well, if it was a single player game this is a valid option. But with having hundreds of people from my server back then here and most of them had their old school name reserved transfer is not an option.
---
Currently it's mostly 2-3 LBs, depending on when the mob is in range, then one earth shock since at 39 the last flame shock tier was pretty weak. And then usually this to the end.
---
When the enemies are higher, I would also drop stoneskin, healing stream and or searing totem. 
---
With 3LBs without any crits, I would usually get an enemy down to 50%, but after that the fight drags on and 3 already take a chunk out of my mana supply.
---
Nightfin snapper into soup is decent money there are better ways to make money for your time. I would recommend farming Ferelas from 12am to 6am as that's when sunscale stop spawning and gives you higher chance for nightfin only. Just double check what the soup and rawfish are selling for. Sometimes the raw fish are selling more than the soup. I was buying red wolf meat, making wolf ribs and just vendoring them for profit. Any red wolf meat &lt;2s.60c will make you profit.

Start your own groups. 
---
And I've found that just taking time to explain helps people a lot. Maybe I'm lucky or maybe it's the server I'm on (EU RP) but I've tanked every instance I've done so far and have had only one problem case. In that case, it was a mage who insisted on casting blizzard and then running into melee to spam arcane explosion as soon as I pressed charge, on every single group, despite being the only one with any AOE. Asked him three times to stop, he said no three times, so I kicked him and found a replacement in an instant. When you're the tank you have that power - don't let yourself be walked over.
---
oh and MARK EVERY PULL. You might think it's unnecessary but make an easy keybind for the skull icon and get in the habit of using it on any pull with 3+ elites. It really helps
---
People are crazy, you should DW fury both sides if you want maximum dps.  Go with a 2h on horse if you’re afraid of pulling aggro I guess.
---
Good advice. I think the feel is unique for each class and really does make certain classes feel better or worse, regardless of what is penned on websites. I love the way the lock plays and that’s why I chose it.

I have 5.4k mana and about 280 spell power, my blizzard deals 170dmg per bolt, get your your mana up, also buy scroll of protection III for about 20s at the AH helps a lot. Make sure you have Mana Ruby everytime you pull. If the pull goes back de-aggro the mobs and try again, better than a death.
---
Hunters still do this :P
---
Thanks! Didn't understand all but will come back to this answer when I start playing my warrior
---
No, barrens is ridiculously good for questing and easily worth 3 alliance zones by itself.  I'm ok with that and I really feel horde questing is easier and more efficient, but I enjoy alliance quests more.  I actually think it's great that the sides are so different, but there is absolutely no contest.
---
Next to Saurfang, between the main entrance and the bank
---
Bro I’m 65 runs in on BRD
---
She does have a ring on her ring finger, so that would be alot of effort to go through. ;-)
---
I think the other continent would have been more exciting. Start out as undead.
---
Helpppp
---
I cant for the life of me find an add on which will give me a visual on screen cue when my arcane meditation clearcasting procs. I have bad hearing and cant hear the audio. Thanks!
---
alcoholism isn't something to be proud of.
---
Just don’t play with mages most other classes without aoe will be cool to play with
---
Could you perhaps put more effort in the formatting of your texts?
---
You are not prepared
---
I mean I think TUF came out before that but yeah
---
Tanking early just sucks.  Theres a very low ceiling to hit, your rage generation.  Itll be like, 3 or 4 auto attacks before you generate enough rage for a sunder.  Ideally you want to be getting hit to get rage, but you cant get early aggro cus dps goes ham, you dont have the rage to get the aggro off the dps because nothing's hitting you, heals are pumping out crazy threat trying to keep dps alive, and everything just snowballs off the pull.  
---
Warrior can only generate so much threat early game.  If you pull threat, generate less threat.  Wait a bit before you heal him on the pull, dps can wait, not use all their stuff.  Also if you pull threat, take it to the tank, taunt is like less than melee range and they're often slowed or dazed, and chasing mobs is less time generating rage and threat.
---
Probably just mental hunter
---
*Especially* a quiver.
---
**PAFF!** Come on then! **PAFF!**
---
How the fuck is it an exploit there's just no guards there lmao
---
Chill dude
---
I don't know squat about pallies, except that they're alliance scum! :P
---
Yeah this is really annoying to see. You can go full DPS spec and still tank anything pre 60. Preferably you hold a shield but even without you can still do it fine. It’s not like you aren’t doing any damage you’re just taking it as you deal it. I don’t understand warriors at all. 
---
As a Druid main I prefer to heal when possible but I’ll flex into any role because I know I can do it no matter the spec.
---
My main in retail was a warrior tank, always tanked up until I stopped playing during Warlords. Playing classic now I wanted to try my hand at Vanilla Paladin.
---
Of course I'm specced Retribution but I'll tank when I need to do some quests in a dungeon, no problem. For the most part I've been lucky and had great runs with people.
---
Earlier today I did a Stockade run, I'm only 29. I tanked for a rogue, mage, lock and priest. I immediately told them I dont have consecrate and its going to be very likely single target. Thankfully they were ok with that. I would sometimes pull 2, maybe 3 and since im an engineer I would pop a grenade and mark who does first and so on.
---
One of the best runs I had and there were a couple of times someone pulled aggro but it wasnt devastating.
---
Not everyone out there are impatient dicks. There are some good, patient players out there and I always make sure they know how much I appreciate them.
---
Promote him immediately. :)
---
You're looking for an RPPVP server

Never understood the appeal of overpriced plastic and CEs.

By holding rightclick like everyone else, but that's the kicker.
---
Strafing has its used without turning direction, while keyboardturning as its called is rendered useless imho.
---
Turning should always be done with the mouse!
---
I see someone has played Eve: Online
---
I remember doing MC so many times and still never managed to get this. DKP always fucked me over.
---
Yeah, clearing the mobs that spawn where the quest mobs do. Don't think that really counts as grinding
---
Join another guild. Loot council is never fair. There’s always bias.
---
Yeah, "Ahhhhh" means "that drink was good" or "I see". "Aaaaaaaah" can either mean "I get it!" or "I'm falling!".
---
Lol, as is the Forsaken didn’t have a hard enough time already trying to find a home and allies. Now Sylvanas gotta make it even harder.
---
I tend to agree with you, but some servers do have a population imbalance that is pretty extreme. A few servers are 70%+ Alliance and vice versa. I happen to be on one of those servers and am the minority. It can be pretty rough at times.
---
&gt;I was just recently involuntarily put into a psyche ward a few weeks ago and I'm sure that makes me very biased.
---
That doesn't make you "biased", that means you have experienced the situation first hand.  I got lucky by being able to talk my way out of a situation where police showed up at the door and basically interrogated/threatened me with potential involuntary detainment almost 10 years ago in a situation related to depression after confiding in a guildie.
---
Being first in line for BRE would probably put you ahead of the warriors 10th in line behind other warriors and rogues for 1hs, but will behind the optimally geared dual wield fury warriors.
---
Healer here. No, you're not an asshole! Do what you want to do. A good group is going to understand that you should play what you like to play. If you're stealing some aggro from the tank as you're in the leveling phase, oh well. You do you.
---
“It’s just a game” is probably the dumbest statement anyone has ever said
---
Who?
---
I play a tank. Dps are mental 95% of the time. It’s rare I’m not just running around chasing agro and watching dps run away from me... I don’t mind it, makes the game more fun for me but holy.... sometimes I just let the dps get hit a few times
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Need it if its good for you, theres a lot of rainbow stated items, but generally, if it has more or equal agility as strength, then its probably still good for you.
---
Generally prioritize crit&gt;agi&gt;ap. You get 2 AP per agi, but roughly half the crit other classes get from Agi.
---
Dont be afraid of rolling on an item just because theres a few points of strength in it, sometimes useless stats just get caught in the crossfire.
---
use the "shoot" ability it will turn on auto attacks with your  equipped wand.
---
And you can either wait a couple seconds and throttle your DPS to let void keep agro, or you can switch to another pet and "drain tank" or "fear kite" (look up videos on how to do that properly)
---
You're just an asshole for being so rude towards others.
---
Your class is the best tank in the game so people would like you to tank. You don't have to but don't expect people to be happy with your decision because only one class is the best tank but there are multiple classes doing great DPS.
---
People would take mages as tanks if they could but they can't meanwhile you're standing there in leather gear wanting to DPS instead of using your class's skillset to the max.
---
Nah sorry I like having a brain
---
I fucking hate this argument, it's so dumb.
---
If OP wants to force people to bring him as a DPS warrior, he should pay their sub.
---
I'm leveling a rogue doing this after doing a mage to 30. Oh boy its chill
---
Thanks, luckily I did most them without know. Just got the watch
---
Hunter here.
---
I get really annoyed by the constant pushing for pulling more mobs, AoE, and skipping as many packs as possible. Let's have a chill run for everyone, tank definitely included.
---
If you're so fucking impatient with the dungeon runs, the fastest thing for you is to not go at all.
---
The tank will be able to hold aggro provided the group cooperates. Everyone has responsibility for threat management, not just the tank.
---
Yeah, me too.
---
People are getting upset at you because you have a way to make more money that you are opting away from in favor of inhibiting the farming of other people that do not have access to the superior method.
---
You are not only being inefficient, you are causing other people to be less efficient as a result of your choices.
---
You're free to do this, but others are also free to get frustrated with you for doing it.
---
Pretty sure my bank alt is in your guild
---
Hope you all have many great adventures together!

Thanks but it's not really big plays, more like  a strong warrior cd and plenty of luck. Really badass when it happens, though.
---
Just ran into a "Judaspriest"
---
wait i thought you had to suck cock?.. those fuckers fooled me again
---
So it depends. What is your main hand? Deathbringer is for sure superior to Mirahs Song, even though it is slower.
---
You are correct that a fast offhand is ideal, while main hand should be slow unless you are constantly rage capped (shouldn't be possible at phase 1 gear level). That being said, the raw damage increase from Deathbringer would make it superior to Mirah's Song.
---
Without knowing what your main hand weapon is, I'd put Deathbringer in your main hand, as it's slow speed makes it great for instant attacks, which is likely only whirlwind, but its still helpful.
---
How cool would it be to actually have an Iron Bank of Braavos or something sort ran by players. Large amounts of resources gathered and collected over a series of characters in a guild that loans out gold or resources to players on an expected ROI. If they don't pay back the Iron Bank doesn't give them any support, blacklists them, and their name becomes infamous. 
---
I know it wouldn't actually work, but it would be quite cool.
---
It’s ok. I’m not going away from home for a few hours atleast.
---
Paladins are the best healers for the cleave dungeons. Ret aura to help the tank keep aggro, salv on the casters. Bop every 3-5 mins for if a caster gets aggro.
---
This is only viable if you are the only one on your layer doing it, which on my server is never the case
---
You split MC with alts, not with 20 people, that is Ony.
---
What did I miss? Looked to me he was happy he got an Arcanite Reaper crafted instead of a mount.
---
His name was Geralt of Rivia. He was a Witcher. A professional monster slayer.
---
Single target frost is a lot better for questing and PVPing (due to frostbite). Up to you though, 5g when saving for a mount is significant.
---
Had a three way tie for Briarwood reed in UBRS the other day that I lost have never seen that happen
---
Lol, he deleted his posts.  The only thing worse than an expoliter and a liar is a coward.
---
in your spell book under the general tab there is a "shoot" button. use that to auto-attack with the wand. put up dots then wand
---
Wowhead has good guides, don’t know if it’s exactly what you are looking for?
---
Pretty much any caster mob should have spells you can use while MCing
---
I haven’t had those issues besides a couple LUA errors a few updates ago, might be an addon conflict?
---
Alliance dont own heartseeker any more. It's probably 60:40 now and moving towards 50:50. It was really bad at first when they first xferred, but now the horde are following since they realize being alone on a server with no alliance is lame. Heartseeker will be a great 50:50 server for phase 2.
---
What's ar?
---
Why not try shadow in that case?
---
&gt;and in PvP you'll get creamed by equally skilled players.
---
What are you smoking?
---
Every decent horde premade will have ele shamans for the utility and that insane burst. Nothing in the game can destroy kill tragets like a ele shamy.
---
Feral/restro hybrid spec is on of the most anoying and hard to kill opponents you can face in pvp. They do good damage too. Its almost as busted as SL locks.
---
Alliance will bring heal palas to premades because nothing in the game can keep someone alive like a paladin. Best single target healer in the game. 
---
Ret paladins are actually good in pvp, you should not lose to an equal geard and skilled rogue as a ret in patch 1.12.
---
Druids are the best flag carriers in the game.
---
I would say the elite alliance guilds would be more incentived to form alliances with casual alliance guilds to contest the world bosses. 
---
On the dominant faction, you aren't going to be seeing world bosses unless you are part of the elite guild cartel.
---
Don't roll on shit you don't need
---
What if OP joins on a "LF DPS for X Run then GTG" joins and then they say "your tank cuz you're a Warrior" No that wasn't what OP agreed to. Yes that makes them (the group) enititled.
---
Because it's me.
---
nope! cheers
---
A lot of horde are xferring to heartseeker. They're following the alliance, itll be 5050 soon.
---
And excelling means doing the most DPS you can. That agrees with my original point?
---
&gt; You do not play the game to jerk off DPS.
---
Most DPS do. That's the point of rolling a DPS.
---
&gt; You can jerk of playing like a beast
---
Which you can do whilst maximising your DPS. These aren't mutually exclusive premises.
---
Lvl 36 warrior, my main was a warlock throughout vanilla/tbc and this is MUCH different, thought it was all memes but it was all truth.
---
Do you need some friends?
---
On certain RP servers like Deviate Delight they are very serious about it and you will experience role players organically just playing the game. On some other ones like Grobbulus you have to go out of your way to find it
---
There are no guild standings in classic, that's why every APES video is plastered all over the WoW and reddit forums.
---
Anyone telling someone how to play the game is wrong I'm sorry.
---
Same, honestly P5/P6 is the part I'm most looking forward to.
---
My guild back in vanilla only got to 7/14 naxx since our geared tanks and healers kept getting poached by the two guilds farther in content than us. We were unable to beat patchwerk or the 4H because of it.  We never got farther than 5/9 AQ40 either.  I really want to experience C'thun, 4H, Sapp, and Kel Thuzad.
---
Ok, now I understand what you're saying. Yes, people shouldn't lump druids in with paladins. Druids are viable tanks. They're not as good as warriors, true, but they are FAR more viable than paladins. Here are some key differences:
---
Neither druids nor paladins can become uncrushable, but druids have far better mitigation to help compensate for that, even though paladins can block. This makes Paladins take spikier damage, the healer's nightmare.
---
Druids can taunt, paladins can't.
---
Druids have far better threat. Hell, as you said, Druids' threat exceeds warriors until late game gear, and even then it takes things like thunderfury and dps gear for warriors to exceed druids.
---
So yeah dude, druid tanks should be taken seriously. Just need to make sure your healers know what to expect, and your dps may thank you.
---
No, I think the barber shop was the first and that wasn't released until Wrath.
---
He said nothing about forcing them to take him as dps, but if people are telling him he should only tank that's not right
---
46 Orc, I want to MT raids but have heard that competition will be higher to make the raid/roll on loot. Should I give up and start looking at dps or is there a reasonable chance I can find a guild to tank for? Edit: once I'm 60
---
Wrong. Paid transfer can go anywhere in retail. My main started on tichondrious followed a friend to wyrmrest and is now on bonechewer
---
Just download on top replica, you can pnp any window.
---
Keep it up. Rogues are already a dime a dozen, those like you get left behind bc of your shittty attitude and unwillingness to stick to the group mantra. Server rep becomes a real thing 3 months from now when all the plebs (hopefully you too) quit.
---
You wouldnt unlock the chest either if the group didnt clear the instance to it.
---
Oh hey I'm there! I'm bear #2
---
Exactly and alliance is far from the dominant faction hence why I said they have zero chance.
---
Guild standing comes from stuff like giving your  bankchar scarab lord.
---
Ultimate e-peen moves count into being famous/infamous.
---
No, OP is the entitled one insisting he has the right to join other people's groups and not abide by their rules.
---
Didn't even have to shout
---
I don’t think enough horde will come but I hope it becomes a 50/50
---
Damn son you got real upset. Did a big bad rogue steal your chest?
---
No, the entire point of classes is to fulfill a certain role.  If such a class existed no one would be interested in grouping with them.  “Jack of all trades, master of none” is a quote for a reason.
---
Early on I saw enemy rogues questing so I'd throw a hunter's mark to keep tabs on them while I'm grinding mobs. Without fail, they would finish their mob and b-line to attack me lol
---
Not on your server but it's probably fine. There's times my server seems quiet and then this weekend it was more populated than I've ever seen.
---
You realize refusing to tank is the same thing as forcing them to bring him as dps right?
---
got to level 80. was one hell of a grind
---

&gt;Probability of getting exactly 2 Eye of Sulfuras in 7 tries will follow the binomial distribution with p=0.03 (from wowhead classic) where Y=2 and n=7. Y="getting exactly 2 success", n=trials  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Y\~bin(p)  
---
&gt;P(Y=2)=0.01623 or (rounded) 1.6% probability.
---
So he behaved like 90% of the Classic playerbase and confirmed exactly what the classic naysayers had been saying would happen for years
---
Color me surprised... not
---
See ya'll back on retail in 5 months, probably less for most of you
---
Waiting your turn at the DMV like...
---
Jack of TWO trades:
---
Warrior: Dominating the Tanking scene. Best class period for tanking. While also being one of the 3 Top DPS classes in the game.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Half-assed Jack of all trades:
---
Paladin: Paladin can wear plate and use shields and hold his ground tanking end game dungeons. But that's as far as his tanking can go.
---
And for DPS, humm, lets just say paladin have a DPS spec but it's so bad.
---
And for Healing, Paladin is the most overpowered healer in the game.
---
Even more Half-assed Jack of all trades:
---
Druid: Druid Tank is not popular but is quite good.
---
Druid DPS is bad.
---
Druid Healer is bad.
---
Looks like you've been grinding hard on the pre-raid BIS so well deserved!
---
&gt;classiccastbar 
---
I can't figure out how to configure my character's cast bar. ClassicCastbar has provided a targe't cast bar that I can position and customize, but my own characters cast bar is still the default and it covers my actionbars. I can't figure out how to customize it.
---
That’s fucking stupid it should totally be allowed
---
Did you know that MoM is in fact a mace and still the best available weapon in the game.
---
Anything with an absurdly high top end damage will be picked by a warrior. Sulfuras blows BRE straight out of the water.
---
There is one problem with gearing up one person totally first.
---
If you all start all on equal level gear and dps-wise and base your upgrades on gear or dps then you start to have dps gap. Kind of like the economy. The rich get richer. So you give gear to one person, they are now more geared and do more dps, so you give them more gear because of their gear and dps, which makes them more powerful. Meanwhile, those that started off on equal levels are falling behind becuase gear is being funneled to one person. That and better hope they don't miss a raid and then a noticeable dps decrease because the only geared person of class isn't there. XD
---
Also, until you are hit capped, decent amount of crit &amp; +AP/SP damage done is kind of random. One person might crit x3 in a row jumping them on dps meters while another equally geared person gets x2 resists and a normal hit. 
---
The only time you should funnel gear is to your MT so they can stay alive for encounters.
---
This isn't how you improve your guild's reputation, by the way. Take the high ground and be a bit less condescending.
---
Is there a resource that explains how to get from one zone to another, and if and when you should go (based on level and horde/alliance)? I keep doing quests in the same zones but would like to explore the map and not miss any leveling zones since this is my first time playing.
---
Also, is there an addon that shows XP received from quests? I seem to be doing a lot of low xp quests even though they are in and above my level range. Basically going back and forth and giving characters items.
---
Level 26 is very far down the level curve. The population at that level isn't indicative of server activity. You'd want to look at level 40 zones for that.
---
Looks like somebody just stepped foot into sfk and has discovered that tank druids can hold aoe threat with 1 button.
---
Good on ya
---
Yup thats why im never joining a pug again. Trash guild was getting carried by us pugs and their 56s were winning equips and then just trading it to their 60s/ not wearing em.
---
The reason for the high amount of horde is because they have a base with flight right beside the spawn.
---
I don't even know what went wrong, people just kept dying. it wasn't me dying either and I was the tank so maybe people just couldnt handle running away in time or something? I really have no idea
---
Can you piss off? You've gone on many of my posts just to insult me.
---
I think we have 2 Benediction's now.
---
Very much agree. The redeeming quality of UDs is the coolness story and attitude wise. Taurens do indeed look HUGE with pauldrons of valor for example.
---
You’re wrong, you said NEVER when at one point you could change from PVE to PVP and vise versa with a paid transfer 
---
Now you’re saying “for vanilla” when you came out the gates with such a bold a stupid statement that wasn’t true.
---
Nothing is more badass than a fragile and weak looking undead that beats everyone's ass
---
Sure, I suppose that is likely as well.
---
Doing the math (if I did it correctly) puts it at roughly 1 in 4000 chance of getting 2 eyes over 7 attempts at a 2% chance for an eye to drop.
---
Not nearly impossible, but still warrants investigation.  Bugs happen, things get changed.  We saw this with the raid xp bug.
---

To accentuate the horde win ratio? People in pve realm are not as practiced in PvP which will make alliance lose even more if you share battlegroup between server type

PULL REQUEST: Fix typo in previous release's documentation.

PRIORITY: Low

Its drop rate is up there. My guild has had 3 drop so far.
---
It's a lot more than just a UI overhaul.  It includes so many additional features that are normally handled by a single addon (omnicc, classic castbars, etc) that it's almost like an all in one package for stuff you never knew you were missing.  And then all the little things that are almost impossible to find anywhere else like a chat highlighter for keywords such as dungeons you want to run is just icing on the cake.
---
Ele doesn’t start to really outshine enhan in leveling until mid-late 40s. Now that you’re 40 mail pieces with intellect will really help you out. Equipping mail will allow you to stop using healing and stone skin most of the time, if not always. Use searing on almost every mob, if it’s a higher tier mob or you can stay in the same area for a while throw down a mana totem as well. If you know you’re going against a caster throw down a grounding totem beforehand. 
---
For ~3 mob pulls, I Place an earthbound totem in the middle of my max range and the mob group. Then I start off with a CL and throw a fire nova by the earthbound. Then throw a magma totem by EB, kite, and CL when off CD.
---
Play what you want, fuck what entitled idiots on the internet think.
---
I went there at 5am, it was a wasteland, so I go about happily destroying mobs only to be ripped apart out of nowhere by a named elite lvl 55 rare vulture that ate my body afterwards.

I’m not talking about any other expansion other than what is relevant.
---
That's fine, they had absolutely no complaints and enjoyed themselves.
---
More power to you brother. You go out there and keep being elite!
---
Heres the crux of it man. Dont give a flying fuck what others think and do your thing. Own it, love it and people will love you for it.
---
You just Mind control them, then cast the buff (they will already be targeted). Casting the buff will automatically end the MC too. You then /pat and continue on your way with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Or MC them again and walk them straight off that boat/cliff/lift/zepplin :)
---
That is how leveling fishing works. You can go to a high level zone, but it won't be any faster. You will catch some more valuable fish while leveling though.
---
Forced to because the run to badlands is easier from arathi than steppes/gorge. But they only step into wetlands once and as long as you arent on that main road, youre extremely safe. You can almost count wetlands as a non pvp zone due to this. Horde have zero quests there.
---
You use auctionator and move on.
---
Love it. Going to do this right now.
---
Speed is not entirely irrelevant. The normalization only refers to the attack power gained for instant attacks.
---
I mean the dude who whispered you was an ass but the point is still valid. 
---
You have the ability to access way higher gp/hour farms that other classes can't do (the ZF zombie farm is over 50g/hr), but things like the elementals are all some classes can effectively do. 
---
So you're being less efficient for yourself while also limiting the capabilities of others.
---
Just like Classic. love it. 
---
Probably don't want Hunters to be forced to use melee weapons in melee range either.
---
Ok. Then you got DC'd. Regardless there was something else at play. You didn't AFK out and now have to wait in a queue.
---
The server could have bounced.
---
Your internet connection could have flaked out.
---
Stop creating fake outage and snowflake bullshit drama when you don't have all the facts.
---
Rofl id be shit faced around barrens. Bravo.
---
Sure, BRE is a lot better for PvP. Whats your point?
---
Group finder is a good idea. Let people select their role(s) and dungeon(s) and autogroup them, but then let everyone hoof it to the dungeon and for the love of GOD never ever cross server. But as an alternative to spamming /LFG I'm all for it.
---
Now just find Painkiller and have JudasPriest MC him
---
That's the root of the problem.
---
And here I thought people wanted the challenges.
---
Really? That's a shame. I've always loved jack of all trade classes, (like bard in DnD) because I always love all the classes and playstyles and I believe they have their own role in things. I'll probably try all the classes or just find another game to play (I've been looking for a new game to play) since I probably don't have time to play everything.
---
Ah thank you! I think this is what I am looking for, just gotta figure out how it works
---
&gt; They know most of all the ins and outs of the gameplay. There aren't surprises anymore and people can handle harder situations because they know their classes.
---
Wow isn't a difficult game and it wasn't hard to figure out back then. This whole "everyone's better now, no one knew what they were doing back then" shit I keep hearing is very wrong, lots of people know the ins and out of the game just as well back then. There are a lot of reasons why there are a larger number of better players at 60 right now but wait until the casual zerg start hitting and start doing dungeons. I read a post the other day about midlevel mages using strictly their aoe spells on single target mobs for example.
---
And yes even back in Vanilla you had very fast dungeon groups, the better players didn't sit there in one spot killing one mob at a time. Dungeon speed is taking the optimizing the shortest amount of time to kill mobs combined with your casters having the least amount of downtime drinking. If you don't have to wait on your healer to drink because you cc a mob or two that's speeding up the clear time of your dungeon overall.
---
Correct, but it was around mid 30s when I started dabbling. But that isn't the point. The point is "a true classic experience" doesnt mean no addons. Everyone had addons. Especially decursive and omen.
---
Neither, Warlocks don't get that ability.
---
Hunters are dope for PvP. Shaman might be a good alt if thats what youre looking for since a hunter can be your cash cow
---
Why do you need it to be 40 yards?  Why don't you play the game as it was intended?
---
Ashenvale is usually kinda dead for Horde. It isn't a very popular questing area.
---
Head over to Hillsbrad, if that place is dead then you might have a problem.
---
I'm dealing with a hardcore guild poaching my members... it's like what's the rush...
---
Or it could’ve never dropped! Praise RNGesus
---
No one does MC with 20 people.  And no, that is actually not our goal.  Loot is secondary to speed and execution.
---
1 trinket mage? Looks like they have 2 trinkets in pic. I also, technically have 1 dps trinket since getting Briarwood Reed has been a RNG nightmare for me. Have run UBRS with Jed being up over 20x and seen Reed x5 and lost roll each time since I usually have 6+ competition.
---
That group is doing it wrong
---
gross
---
You made fun of me for having anxiety.
---
I was handing out wool bags in Goldshire, cuz I made a bajillion (sent tons of wool from my main). I gave them all out to some very grateful players, and then a 60 warlock whispered me. He appreciated what I was doing and traded me 4 runecloth bags. It was awesome!
---
Yes it is extremely dependent on your competition, the pools have a very long respawn timer.
---
The ending was the best part
---
The cute dancing female night elf your hitting on is a 43 year old bald man.
---
It doesnt add too much i think thats why its being added so soon.
---
The farming there is pretty good money tbh, im not sure why, but vendors will buy those rocks for surprisingly high prices!
---
&gt;Sulfuras blows BRE straight out of the water.
---
Nope lol
---
No. Anything is viable.
---
The only issue is you are going to be constantly pressured into tanking as that is always the hardest thing to find as a group. If you are willing to wait an extra 20-30 minutes when forming groups so you can melee DPS instead of tanking, that is on you.
---
Do you have a weapon spec talent that gives crit?
---
Nice staff! But at least for Mages that a backup BiS to the Mageblade+OH combo. Are there any classes where that is their BiS?
---
Wotf only lasts 5 seconds
---
Tallgeese, it’s perfect.
---
I am at a point where I have to ask Mages for the Int buff... WHILE we are in the same group inside of a dungeon.
---
One of those mages that refused to buff me actually had the audacity to ask me for a new stamina buff (it ran out and no, I did not give him a new one) 
---
What the hell is wrong with most of them? I never had to ask for one of those back on Private Servers, why is it becoming a thing?
---
Oh shit, Rhon is me.
---
I had a feeling this would go on reddit.
---
Too bad you tried that after we rolled for the chest.
---
this is what playing a warrior feels like
---
How?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Hitting 58 today on my warlock. Finished my MC attunement quest / friendly with Argent Dawn but finishing the remainder of Eastern Plaguelands today so I can start doing Scholomancel UD and Stratholme dungeon quests.
---
I'd point out that if anyone's the 'bad guys' on Azeroth, it's the Humans.
---
I loved my warlock in vanilla.  Questing was great, DPS in dungeons was great, utility was great, having a little demon pet was great. 
---
I played shaman to about 45 too and it was fun too, but not as fun. I was running out of mana all the time which made me never want to use totems, which is the best part of the class!
---
And you just repeated my point. Everybody's classic experience was different. So what does "true classic experience" mean?
---
Question: why is the healers mana pool considered yours? 
---
Follow up: do you feel that they should be spending 30 seconds drinking but you don’t?
---
Wow, thanks! I hadn't thought of that, doctor!
---
You are welcome.
---
Also, Arthas did what he did after fusing his mind with an Orcish warlock. Not a single WOW evil deed is done without Orcish/Forsaken intervention. Kthxbye.
---
I tank UBRS full arms and am top dps unless there’s a geared mage. If you can’t do that, you or your healer are gearing or playing incorrectly.
---
At least he had a good attitude about it.  Lol
---
The 30-40 bracket is painful but, in my case, it was more a matter of class rather than anything else. I'm a priest at heart.
---
Jesus what a dick. Why do people gotta be like that.
---
BRE might be better for premades when you have a dispel bot. Thing is battlegrounds aren't going to be out for 6 months. For now I'd rather have Rag.
---
... now with free frogurt!
---
I'm gonna keep him forever
---
Lack of AÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Smart guy
---
Out of curiosity, how much do those go for on your server?
---
I just went to buy some for my rogue only to see them sitting at 70s per. Looks like I’m not gonna he making any tea for a while lol
---
Tauren are awesome and their mingling with Forsake  n makes no sense lorewise.
---
Lmao you are delusional mate hahahahah
---
Just because I play a mage doesn't mean I have to be confined to ZF zombie farming. I made over 50g that hour I was there 84g to be exact and was able to buy my epic mount. So you could say less efficient I say otherwise.
---
I'll bite, testing this and sharing the results.
---
LF TANK be like...
---
Surely this is a SWIFT mechano chicken?
---
Mages are new hunters goddamn lol
---
For levelling your only thing to pay attention to is stats (+agi + str are your damage stats)
---
Chance on hit effects don't work, manual crowd pummeler from Gnomeragen will give you the buff but other than that you only ever care about the stats.
---
You could also get a bank alt with enchanting and send shitty BOEs to them
---
Okay, so what was the point of this post?
---
To get people to stop offering you a spot in their group as tank?
---
Healing is damn fun as a priest. And people love you as a priest :D
---
You have 2 mins to get back in from a dc.
---
Not worth on warrior. You got already a fear breaking ability. More melee range and 100% disarm with aoe stun vs rogues  is better imo
---
Female night elf hunter, fits the stereotype. That’s awesome tho!
---
I do like Shadow, I suppose I didn't really consider it since it isn't a particularly good DPS in Classic and you're always starved for mana,  but I have nothing to lose at this point. Maybe I'll see if I can even get into groups as it. Thanks.
---
Weapon damage does not matter at all. All that matters is your attack power rating, which is derived from the strength and agility (in cat form) on all your gear.
---
Wait you didn't start doing that at about 54?
---
Its actually about forcing me to tank not me forcing someone to invite me as dps but youre a hunter I can understand that you have some problems with reading and such
---
3rd or 4th time in this thread.
---
I do not care one bit how you play the game.  Stop pushing that I am telling you how to.
---
You don't even need that. The arcanite might cost you 2k gold. Everything else your guild should already have by simply raiding. It's just a question of selling it or giving it to a guildie. IMO the choice is obvious.
---
I’ve seen him on Heartseeker, too. Said he’s trying to raise gold for his mount
---
Whatever works, I guess
---
It never shows the correct amounts for me. I've stopped using the tooltops it as it does nothing helpful.  Its great for the actual AH window though.
---
That's player made not the default lfg everyone uses
---
&gt; but how the fuck you going to explain this Mountain Lion literally not having blood?
---
Your character gets so angry, it drinks the blood all "PEH, NOT EVEN WORTH HANDING INTO THAT ONE GUY/GAL WEAK FIEND"
---
You only solo the Goblin and Princess in these runs as a Hunter. Get a pet with nature and I believe fire resist for an easier time.
---
LookingForGroup.
---
Roll Prot, Charge 20g a instance. and profit
---
Ranged too
---
Shaman. More fun
---
Do what you enjoy man. If you prefer those mobs then farm those mobs. You are playing the game to enjoy it, not to be as efficient as possible. 
---
Blows my mind how these people are so caught up on efficiency when we all spend our time playing wow, which is an extremely inefficient use of real world time, no matter how much you min max it
---
Lvl 30 on my undead priest. 
---
Somehow I am slowly loosing interest in the game. All my friends are 45+ and it is kinda boring alone.
---
I agree with this, as a shaman. If we didn't have a rogue in the group, who would even open it in the first place. It would go to waste. We gonna start asking the rogue for his pickpocket loot too? Gimme a break. Locked chests are for the rogue only
---
Youre seriously delusional mate
---
My guild had issues with it because bolvar was missing from the keep and prestor kept phasing in and out.
---
I love the atmosphere of the forsaken zones and duskwood too.. after an aborted attempt playing night elf it was those areas that made me get addicted..
---
You're a legend. Cannot thank you enough for this!
---
true story, every fucking zone is like 10 hordes to 2 allys
---
Blacksmiths can make keys to open locked chests but I only yoink the locked ones on PUGs.
---
Well, there was this funny saying going around the last few days that went like: Everyone should play whatever they enjoy, except if you are a warrior than you better tank for my group.
---
Honestly, you hit the nail on the head with the last sentence. If they want a tank so badly they should roll one themselves.
---
My favourite dumb argument regarding this whole thing is just strap a sword and shield onto yourself and go tank. If you don't enjoy it, don't do it. I don't know why it's so hard for people to understand that different people enjoy different things and tanking is deffinetly a different thing than playing dps or healer. Well duh.
---
If you get asked to tank just calmly explain to them that you absolutely don't enjoy the role at all and that's it. Nobody, not even reddit, should force you to play something you don't want to.
---
And btw. this comes from a Warrior Tank main. I personally love tanking and wouldn't want to play a different class is my main but I have absolutely no problem with people enjoying different things.
---
Nope... just time to start collecting alts
---
Yeah that guy had no idea what he’s talking about. Druids are king of dungeon tanking
---
I am fishing for Winter squid in Azshara, I have 425 fishing skill and i catch in best time of the day 50-60 units per hour.. (three stacks per hour) and it's like 10 gold... Not even 40 or 100...so you are a liar.
---
My paladin got the "dual reinforced leggings" from a gnomer quest with double armor and +5 defense. Meanwhile her thighs could get chopped off from the gap, and she basically could have a lip slip at any moment 😂
---
Patience goes a long way. I passed on certain gear I knew the tank needed, even if it might be an upgrade for me, and in return they passed on ravager for me. I love interactions like that in the community.
---
R/cringe
---
Stupid ogres.  This cookbook sucks.  What if I want 4 man?  How hard do I hit? How big a fire do I need?  Does it matter what color man I can find?

[Bank Heist](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/acaxis/key-and-peele-the-heist)

I can't help in any way but I have a question:
---
What add-on is that for your Mana bar?
---
They loaned him the money
---
Well, ingots can be plentiful or you might've gotten none at all. They only have a 30% dropchance.
---
I imagine this guild just shopped around and had everybody from the core raidroster chip in an afternoon of busy strat:live grinding.
---
Your uptime on flurry is going to depend more on your crit percentage than on the speed of the weapon. Yes, a faster weapon will use up the stacks more often, but it will also crit more often, as it has more chances to crit.
---
You want a fast offhand to provide fluid rage generation. It's not a hard and fast requirement, as rage generation is normalized for weapon speed, but typically getting smaller amounts of rage more often is better because it allows you to activate abilities as soon as you have the rage/as soon as they come off cooldown, rather than waiting and then have an abundance of rage. Get it?
---
Edit: That said, your weapon stats matter more than the speed. The crit gained by your weapon combo is excellent, so I wouldn't worry about the slower speed of assassination blade.
---
Aww
---
Can you confirm that it was actually from the scarlet archmages tho? And not the sorcess in the other spot
---
You missed the most important part of P2, 55 mage water
---
I wouldn't be in your guild.
---
So you can get twice as much loot but you don't want to do it, why?
---
Well said.
---
But in battleground groups they'll be against evenly ungeared peeple so it doesn't matter
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO\_castsequence](https://wow.gamepedia.com/MACRO_castsequence)  could this work?
---
Asmongold.
---
Wow. You lucky sob. I am very jealous. I refer to that as the Hammer of Neverdrop.
---
Anyways, in that case, keep Ironfoe in your main hand, because it's a great weapon and you can't move it to offhand. I would still say put Deathbringer into your offhand. Yes, its slower, but the huge damage increase over Mirah's Song more than makes up for the slower speed. Rage generation is based on damage done, after all.
---
Hahah this is great. Surprised you only got to level 2.
---
Get a flight timer.
---
Pretty important until you hit the hit % cap (which i can’t recall off the too of my head.)
---
I kinda gave up - feral Druid got the only one I saw drop
---
Agreed, this person is a little crazy.
---
Thank you for understanding what so many people fail to see. : )
---
Late 30s were a bit of a slog but as soon as I hit mail I ground out Scarlet Monastery armory until I was the image of Herod himself.
---
Hey, you ever want to fly from Ratchet to Theramore before going back north? Of course you do!
---
I also hate the statement “it’s just a game” . I play the game to have fun and that means winning and being serious about winning to me. Whenever someone says “it’s just a game” to me because they think I’m too serious I want to punch that fucker in the face, but I don’t because it’s illegal. I’ll still think about punching that fucker for hours though.
---
Also there's often significant level gaps between quests where you've finished all the green and yellow quests but all the remaining quests are orange or red.
---
TBH when I think about it I never dealt with drama because I was 8 years old and just enjoyed playing. People could have ninjaed epics or been rude and I may have missed it.
---
The other side is when I play these games I focus on sticking with a good crew of people and while I may get involved with PUGs occasionally - every guild i’ve been with in 14 or so years has been a good experience.
---
This time around it feels like i’m doing it right, im 22 so I get to come back and hang in my old playground. I’ve found a guild like the aforementioned and plan on sticking with these guys as long as the guild is kickin. I’ve also got 3 IRL friends playing and a few guildies who have become part of a solid 5-10 man group and so if I need gold I can farm anything from Devilsaur to Strat Live with healers and DPS I trust while I run MT / OT roles.
---
If any of these players joined our groups they’d be laughed out of the guild before anyone had a real problem. Its cool because in BFA and most other expansions past Cata hasn’t really rewarded people for playing in tighter groups anyway.
---
Welcome to the guild

I’ve died three times so far protecting him.

Can make a cast sequence macro. so you hit the same button 4 times.
---
    /castsequence Conjure Water, Conjure Food, Arcane intellect, Ice Armor;
---
Press this 4 times and it's a macro. Don't press it 4 times and it's botting.
---
1 button press -&gt; 4 in-game actions, against the ToS.  
---
4 button presses -&gt; 4 in-game actions, OK and can be done easier with /castsequence.
---
kill a big red kitty? not likely
---
You wanna use castsequence. Icy veins has examples of a ton of useful mage macros like this. 
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-guide-to-mages-best-addons-and-macros
---
You probably won't want to use that thing in raids though, given the debuff limit
---
/castsequence reset=10 Spell1, Spell2, Spell3, Spell4
---
When you press the macro, it will cast Spell1, when you press it again within 10 seconds it will cast Spell2, press again within 10 secs to cast Spell3, etc...
---
If you dont press the macro for 10 secs it will reset to Spell1.
---
Replace Spell1, Spell2... buy your spells names.
---
Warlock is dps with a bunch of utility.
---
Shaman in raids are almost always healers, but they are fun healers due to totem rotations. Not just about spamming heals over and over. It's the only class I've played where I really enjoy healing in dungeons.
---
Just like the fact that apparently 99 out of a 100 Zhevras have no hooves.
---
You slightly confuse "I want to earn twitch money so I compete in how deep can I shove my content in community throat" with "I want to earn sponsorship money so I compete in killing this boss before other guilds do". Again, MC/Ony mattered more because of the impressive leveling speed they have shown, be it due to layering abuse or not. I am sure the impact from Nef/C'Thun/Kel is going to be way less. Maybe people will pay attention to war effort though but it was said people can stock it up in advance so likely futile again.
---
If you want to use the popularity and views as a factor, I am pretty much sure APES lose to that streamer whose officer ninja'd boe epic: if anything was plastered all over this subreddit, it's this drama. Something I am not happy with.

What does ‘rested’ actually do? I know you become rested while you’re in a major city or an Inn, but what other benefits of any does it give you?

You can enable target of target. Helps show the tanks focus

Something like Questie might help with not knowing what to do.  I use it to find available quests, but you can also use it to show objectives on the map, such as where to find quest mobs or items.
---
I thought it and was surprised how far down I had to scroll to upvote
---
Always 😂
---
Theres a reason warrior leaders of the top private server guilds are reserving BREs but dont give a shit who gets the hand of rag lol
---
I’ve been doing this for years (minus the drinking). It’s a ton of fun. Another thing I do is walk around the perimeter of the continents. You find some potentially interesting stuff that way.
---
i gave up leveling there
---
Shadow for wands?
---
I love mages that do this. Good stuff
---
You'll see a little line on your experience bar. When you are "rested" you slowly build free xp, and it lets you get double xp from killing mobs until the free xp is used up. Make sure you always log off in a city or an inn, you'll usually get like 2-3 free bars by the next time you log on.
---
Shadowmelded Moonkins. Thanks, now I know that’s a piece of shit guild ;)
---
Try a Druid! While their dps spec isnt magnificent, it gets the job done, and you'll be able to tank dungeons just fine. If you're wanting to heal too, just keep an extra set of high intellect gear for when you need it.
---
Great "immersion": dropping gold and getting more add damage on an attack.
---
It is, it must work differently when browsing on mobile.
---
It is Auctioneer. I got it from Twitch. :)
---
I haven’t even logged in to play once. Matter of fact, I’ve forgotten my log in info and need to download the game.
---
It’s been a rough month. I’m getting to it.
---
yep yet you're getting downvoted and idk why, hense your username.  i wholly agree and upvoted you.
---
Full demo itself is very good too, run the master demonolgist succubus, or master demonologist imp if the threat is an issue, and master demonologist imp also gives your tanks stamina.Demonolgy is really a great spec all around, used in tons of hybrids, and able to stand up on its own.
---
Also shouldnt fire be neutral then? as its useless in raiding and dungeons for the first two teirs, and only really useful in the last 2 raid tiers. so no of course not poop, but i wouldnt put it in "Good tier"  
---
Also "One of the frost builds goes very deep into arcane"  
---
1. isnt that an arcane build then  
---
2. so why does that make it good, but when every build takes atleast a few points, and some go entirely demo, is it still "poop"
---
I simply like doing quests and i get a little OCD about it. It’s not racing to 60 that is the most important thing to me.

Sell them devilsaur is better for humans . Source: the goat of classic wow moo_UK

I agree in a sense that defensive abilities are often in a different gcd than offensive ones, but having a instant dispel that doesn't make a gcd for other spells would be really op
---
I'm loving it, paladin was actually my first choice but my buddies wanted to roll horde so I decided on druid (I like tanking, otherwise I'd have rolled a shaman). The class plays in with how I like to pay role playing games, where I keep my buffs up, swing away, and reactively heal people. I call it casual but in reality it's probably more laziness. Also the lack of mount money anxiety is excellent.
---
You and I have all the reasons to celebrate!
---
I play all roles regularly and honestly tanking is the role I am treated best in by far.
---
You’re not wrong about dps sometimes being crazy on AOE but in my experience they rarely bitch me out but instead apologize for pulling aggro.
---
Username checks out.
---
No shit.  So would I.
---
You have my pity.
---
The game was originally designed to grind mobs, quests were added to make a more interesting layer to the grind. They've said so in a number of interviews.
---
Because in the early patches of WoW, you definitely had to, unless you maybe always "abused" rested XP for 1-2 levels. That would take A LOT of IRL time, but very little in-game time, obviously.
---
Small Edit: more quests were added in later patches.
---
I literally won the roll the first time it dropped. Getting lucky.
---
I agree.  It kind of looks like a shit gold skin in smite.  If it looked cooler, maybe I'd be interested, but certainly not like that.
---
Auctioneer.
---
Put your pc in the microwave oven
---
But you likely dont use every single one of your spells so it's a waste of gold
---
Only in retail is that an option.

(Yes CEO could steal everything, logistics officer (me) a few extra 100b the rest was just what we had liquid at the moment ~120b )

Maybe you’re alliance....
---
lol jk
---
Yeah I noticed that too. The day they came out, they were sold out and on Ebay for $500+. 
---
So disappointed Blizzard didn't put a "limit per customer" on these.
---
Oh, I assumed you disagreed. Sorry. But yeah. Reddit is odd.
---
Okay, so your issue is people being nice and offering to allow you to join their group, which they wouldn't otherwise have done, on the condition you tank.
---
And you call others brain damaged and entitled? rofl.
---
Wut? Orcish warlock? How about medivh? Garithos? Admiral Proudmoore? Queen Azshara?  Emperor Thaurissian? You don’t even need to read the books to know these guys just actually play the game.
---
If your only arguement is stereotyping it has no teeth. Come back when you think of anything creative
---
I use my luck up on pets. Managed to get the hyacin parrot while leveling so i can't complain
---
Yeah its fine he can play dps. And people don't need to invite him to their groups. Since he could tank and chooses not to, subjecting the group to waiting another 30-60+ minutes for tank, and they dont like doing that.
---
In fact, it would be best to get rid of the dps warrior in favor of a mage or something. When a tank pops up, you want him to join your group, not one of the other 5 groups also looking. You dont wanna be the one with the non tank warrior
---
Click the tank and press F. It'll target what he's targeting
---
Technically, alliance 2H fury is viable, it's just so tedious to play with weaving Slam in with auto-attacks that nobody does it. 2H fury is better than dual wield fury if you're low on hit/crit, but because of the aforementioned tedium/difficulty nobody in their right mind would do it.
---
Personally, I'm sticking with arms until my first raid, where I have to ditch it due to the MS debuff, and then I'll do the best I can with dual-wield fury.
---
Yeah, wand specialization
---
If you have to ask, you're a boomer.
---
Its this collective thinking that just because IM a warrior and THEY need a tank Im a dick for not tanking. Like get a grip people Im playing this game to enjoy my free time not to help you gear up faster.
---
I am fifteen. Why would I lie about that? In the posts that I've said I was 15 it was about me needing help, I'm not lying about my age. Why is it so unbelievable that I'm fifteen?
---
Well, you're a warrior who refuses to tank, so, as I said, your ability to apply critical thinking skills and understand implications is severely hindered by something.
---
I switched out a bunch of my spell power gear for just flat int items, helped a ton, even greens can be enough
---
This guy has it. Yes, it's viable. It's also horrible to try and play. Just stick with dual-wield fury (unless you're horde).
---
Hardcore players have nothing else to do with their resources.
---
Its intermediate players who would sell for gold.
---
This makes me wonder more about whether there are more undead who don’t end up following Sylvanas, such as the warlock at Ratchet.
---
Question: can a rouge roll need on both weapons?

Cool story bro.

There's already a sulfuras btw

I would have to test. I know for certain you can’t equip a shield and use Shield Bash with a single button press. It will take at least two.

The main reason warriors go BS is for Lion helm. It takes a lot of effort to get and and you replace it after BWL as far as I know. Mostly not worth it except for leveling. I went skinning and mining as a warrior. Tried enchanting but my skinning was 225 when my enchanting was 30. (Helps that my priest friend went enchanting)
---
Should be able to find plenty of people who'll take you, there are enough folks about who aren't too concerned about having the best lineup possible at the moment. Plus having one shadow priest is apparently fairly accepted. Good at pvp too!
---
That wasn’t my case, and in my understanding that’s not everyone else’s case either. Once I had access to blue weapons of similar item level for 2H and dual wielding, the difference was palpable. Outside of that, you use wildly different abilities. At early levels you barely afford to use anything besides MS OR whirlwind off their cooldowns if you’re 2H. Dual wielding, you need to be spamming heroic strike as it has special hit properties and ignores the 25% chance to miss. Your off hand will always hit like a wet noodle and is strictly for rage generation, ie you want the fastest offhand possible. 
---
Another big thing is don’t fight mobs your level. You should try to exclusively fight mobs around 3 levels under you, dual wielding or not. Because the increased chance to hit is insane making them much easier to kill for negligible or next to no exp lost.
---
And if you still don’t believe that dual wielding builds more rage, look up dual wield tanking. The entire narrative is about how much extra rage you’re getting.
---
Yeah but guilds also need much more than 39 nontanks in reality. My ratio was on the high end but at no point do you need 1:4 or even close in a guild.
---
Stackable gray items, fill your bags and profit
---
Apple had to do this. The shuffle music button was random (as random as you can program anything), but people started to complain that it didn't "feel" random, so they had to change it to be less random.
---
Except they may have had an iffy tank.
---
Or more likely, didnt realize he was warrior before inviting and figuted theyd offer him tank role rather than kicking him.
---
Group leader/majority decides who runs and what roles they may run in. It doesnt matter what conditions anyone agrees to beforehand. This isnt a contract. Its a group with no tank in a game full of dps warriors
---
They can ask but the entire premise that I first replied to you with was that the group only needed 1 DPS, in other words they already had a Tank. Don't expect OP to tank in that situation.
---
I've been having issues for the last 2 weeks.  Today a tech came and checked everything out, this did not resolve the issue.  I contacted their retention dept and now a Customer Advocate Supervisor will be coming out next weekend to do everything the tech did.  The issue is that I'm dropping 33-66% of my packets inside their network starting at their first hop.  The customer service people you call are exactly that, they are not technical support, they don't know anything and the contract techs they send out can't escalate to their network engineering dept.  If they can't get their routers fixed by next weekend I'm going to have to switch to Xfinity or AT&amp;T.
---
Am I alone in thinking it’s condescending to call women adorable for enjoying games?
---
&gt;  If anything, guild accomplishments in gathering legendary items are measured in number of MC raids they can run which depends on nothing but an amount of people in such a guild.
---
It will also matter how few players they can do MC with.
---
If you can 20 man MC, then you can double your drops.
---
And here I spend 1-2 hours a day giving out free water, food, and buffs to anyone at the org bank lol. Wtf some people are beyond toxic.
---
Youre seriously dont know how to read do you?
---
Im saying for like I dont even know what time if you invite me into your group as a DPS (as a fucking dps you mentally retarded twat) but then later on expect me to tank for whatever fucking reason youre an entitled bitch.
---
Im gonna stop answering to you after this because there seriously is no point you either dont understand english very well or just have trouble reading. Or both.
---
I never get bitched out probably because they see me running like a psycho but if they would give me 3 secs after I body pulled 2 packs. Just to group them up. The healers would save mana and the runs would be smoother.  But by all means running around is a lot more engaging then standing in a stack and sundering each target. No argument there. I love it. But the dps are crazy.
---
Dwarf is the best rogue race for sure. For pvp at least. Human is bis for pve
---
Had 2 hours for a WC run that we were all kind of overleveled for, thinking it would be a breeze. Nope. Even tho we all knew the path and were somewhat competent at our roles, I still had to leave without waking the sleeper. Felt like an ass for it too, even tho I told everyone beforehand I had a hard 120 minute limit.
---
God I hate that dungeon.
---
Elemental earths retail for 25s a piece as well on my server, they drop tons.
---
That's classic for you.
---
We cleared it with 31 iirc but we are far from hardcore, a laidback guild of people too old to truly invest our time in this game.
---
What mobs were you farming? I got my essences in EPL and didn't really have an issue other than the limited spawns.
---
What was the route you took?
---
Thanks for the YouTube one. Is there a way doing it with twitch streams?
---
Probably, but I like my options open. Leveled up my professions too, so for me it was a solid investment.
---
Well yeah that *is* that is the meta, but I asked you to define it, not to give an example.
---
a big steamer and his also streamer friends went horde and has a subs guild.  id go there too tbh but I'm only 24 on my main toon on another server and dont wsnt to start over.
---
err i have a friend in thunderfury and a few other toons 12-20 range i could move to the other server i think you get one free one
---
Pretty much every class in the game lol
---
🤣
---
Not a clicker, my system is clunky but works - keeping four fingers on 2, 3, 4, and 5 covers most of what I need, and I swap out banish/fear on the hotbar depending on whether I'm pveing or pvping.
---
In a few months maybe. Right now people are still gearing mains.
---
There are always guilds in need of dependable warrior tanks. You might not be able to find a spot in the biggest guilds on server but it would be easy enough to find a spot in a newer guild
---
Any recommendations what kind of build for jack of all trades?
---
Rogues will delete enh shamans. Just pop evasion
---
I can't stand how artless EvlUI is.
---
/gdisband
---
Charge, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, berserker stance, berserker rage, whirlwind, mortal strike.
---
Rinse and repeat that. Sweeping Strikes plus whirlwind means you dominate on trash.
---
On bosses, just mortal strike and only whirlwind if you will still have enough rage for mortal strike when it comes off cooldown. You won't have rage for anything else.
---
And us warriors are highly weapon dependent. Keep going for weapon upgrades in dungeons.
---
disgusting UI xd
---
You can do it with fewer tanks.
---
I actually went mostly Prot on my paladin for dungeons instead of healing. Pally just has the most tools to deal with this AoE craze we're experiencing lately. I can give every mage -30% threat, Conc for AoE threat and BoP a Mage in an emergency.
---
I'm honestly having such a good time. I never thought I would get into tanking. (No I don't expect to tank at 60, I always main heal and wanted to try Pally instead of Priest, but this leveling experience is such a breath of fresh air.)
---
I dont think anyone thinks that. How can they force you to tank? You can just leave party. Problem solved. That way they can fill your spot with a mage or something. Or someone who does want to tank
---
What stereotype
---
I guess what I meant is on the context of loot rolling, sometimes people will roll for gear that they don’t need for BIS, but will help them out in some other way, like in my previous comment.
---
Its the largest bank in Norway lol
---
Does it move your keybinds over to this UI? I have some things bound to weird keys, but I'm used to playing with them at this point. Im afraid if I change it now I'll forget exactly what was bound to what.
---
Inside those dungeons what happens when you are clearing mobs? Is it not GRINDING dungeon trash to clear the quest mobs and bosses?
---
If you had a collect quest from mobs how did you collect the items if not by grinding? A low drop rate means a lot of grinding. 
---
If you had a kill quest, how many times did you find other mobs around them that were not related? Killing those is grinding. You are also doing quests. But the main exp comes from grinding. 
---
The quest turn ins are a little boost compared to, wait for it, grinding mobs.
---
Aparently if you scream at your monitor it works same as /yell AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
The reason Arms is not considered a warrior raid spec is because of the mortal strike debuff taking a debuff slot. It's too high priority to fall off, and it's a garbage debuff for raids. Otherwise, arms dps is superior to fury until fury gets enough hit and crit. So before I do raids, while I'm farming pre-raid BiS, I'm going to be arms. Sweeping Strikes is awesome too.
---
Yeah i have it, looked it through but really have no idea what that "box" is called. You got any ideas?
---
You can, but you miss out on items and reputations.
---
Calm down.
---
After you calm down, I'd like to know which company you buy your Horse feed from.
---
Ya know, the feed you give to your High Horse after riding around on it all day.
---
Thanks. I thought it was funny.
---
What else can a lvl 23 do when a lvl 60 has nothing better to do than literally just sit in Redridge killing people.
---
When aid from Stormwind is lacking you take matters into your own hands. 
---
and make a really shitty video lol.
---
Hi-explosive :)
---
&gt;Dps war gets upset at "Can you tank?" 
---
Because if you won't equip your shield the dungeon isn't happening
---
lol dude on the right taking shots, dude on the left takes a sip of beer...
---
Blizzard hasn't said, so no, nobody knows. I'd guess no sooner than phase 2, when layers are removed.
---
ha. was just  trying to hide my friend’s battletag
---
Toxic horrors northern felwood
---
It should be called something like „tooltip“
---
Yikes... alright ty
---
This dude Gundams
---
No one can make the dps warrior tank. He is free to leave. It isnt his group it is their group
---
In fact, I am pretty much sure the term "hardcore" means different in current classic and retail (at least 4 years ago). In classic hardcore means "able to grind a lot", in retail it's "smart, fast reaction, able to raid and progress 7 days a week for at least 7 hours a day". So yes, you are pretty much correct if you use the same term/definition.
---
I just reached 44 and have about 7 quests for ZF. How was it healing shadow? I haven't had any trouble yet but definitely notice I'm taking more Mana breaks than I might if I was holy/disc
---
52 balance boomkin Druid here. The biggest benefits I found leveling balance was the fact that resto/balance gear leveling up is basically the same. A lot of intel/spirit and +spell damage here and there where you can get it. This way you don’t have to have a separate resto set if you get called on to heal instead of tanking, and you’ll probably have to switch to healing late game anyway. I’ve also found balance to be pretty reliable in pvp due to our mana bar being big enough to make use of all of our forms and healing. I’ve got a pretty good strategy fighting most classes in wpvp, and I rarely die or camped in wpvp because druids so hard to lockdown.
---
I’d say as balance having fishing and cooking leveled up is super helpful. You’re gonna need water in a generous supply to keep your leveling pace up. I found fishing for Greater Sagefish and making Sagefish Delights in STV a quick and easy fix to the water problem not to mention the random drops that come with fishing a lot. Also find a mage as often as possible to make a couple stacks of water for you when you begin questing.
---
In general I found as balance speccing into starfire and spamming it to be pretty fast killing mobs. Often I found I’d kill mobs faster than a feral Druid, but obviously they don’t have to drink and I do so they still quest faster. My rotation for quest mobs is starfire/moonfire/starfire/starfire. Try to set a cap on how many spells you’re going to cast per mob to Increase your questing speed by using less mana. Currently as 52 questing as balance I try to limit my casting to 3 spells for 1 mob and then finish off with melee, and thorns aura to save up some mana for the next one. I with this strategy I find being able to kill 5-6 mobs in a row fairly quickly, and when you get innervate I you can mana up to full within 10 sec while drinking so you’re back to killing 5-6 mobs round 2.
---
Last thing you might like questing as balance is the crits. My crits are pretty high on starfire and it’s very satisfying watching a mobs health bar drop by nearly half. Currently I average between 1100-1200 crit and my mage friend at 56 only averages about a 100 or 200 more with his Frostbolt so I feel pretty good about my spellcasting damage most of the time, but that’s just me.
---
Hope this helped! Been playing balance since 2005 launch and never really liked feral. If you got any specific questions about balance Druid gameplay I’d be happy to give them a shot at answering them!
---
Grobbulus is a perfect 50/50 split.
---
A little?
---
I'm not too familiar with Druids (my Druid alt is only 43), but I've just been following Wowhead's build for a Feral Druid Hybrid and I've had no problems healing dungeons or completing quests. The most important part while levelling is keeping intellect gear in your bags (even if its cloth) for when you need to heal, in addition to your regular Str/Agi set. Unfortunately I can't help you too much with higher level Druid stuff.
---
Check out an addon called ItemRack, it allows you to define gear sets and then easily switch between them in a single click.
---
I'm thinking the Classic community is just a bit too.. old.. to appreciate this level of autism. I'll keep that in mind. Looks like I'll have to make a "just caught the boat" video.
---
What I find hilarious is that this is doing better on r/wow. The demographics are real lmao.
---
He is literally sitting here saying they should let him run dps in their groups
---
Pvp wise it is probably better than feral, but you will blow your mana pool casting every other mob. It's actually more efficient to level using cat form as balance spec than to try to level as a spell caster.
---
I used to only attack after getting ganked but after the countless horde ganks on me in searing gorge by max level horde players, every red name I see is death.
---
I'm not expecting OP to tank in that situation, I'm expecting OP to not get pissed that he will have to tank if he wants to join the group.
---
Split runs are just to gear mains faster.  Just need to get enough alts to 60 to start making them happen.  Most people are doing Ony splits already.
---
Okay, so if you're just gonna be like this, which is a ridiculous way to be mind you,
---
I will volunteer to meet your ridiculous behavior with some of my own:
---
1) Fuck you, no soul stones. I'll use it on myself, and when you start dying, I'll just /say "Haha, you're in danger"
---
2) No health stones. Same /say
---
I am a warlock. You are but a tool to further my power.
---
People who bitch about warlocks life tapping are the same people who bitch about buffing their group.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
I'm pretty sure you're assuming that I'm just going to tap to 10% health and stare at you since you referenced the threads below.
---
How about you don't make dumb assumptions about people's play and approach things in good faith.
---
I have many methods of getting my mana back, and if we're in totally reset because of a near wipe, of course I'm going to drink.
---
But you can bare to toss me a ranked down renew mid pull when I tap from 30% mana to 70%, and spend 40% health to get there. God damn.
---
I will die on the hill that I owe nobody anything unless they are in my group. Why is there so much entitlement over this?
---
I remember that being a fairly good spot. hmm.
---
yes, warriors are best when they have at least full t1 set with an epic shield. But when everyone is undergeared - druid is king. And to catch up with druid\`s threat generation - warrior needs Thunderfury.
---
I think account sharing/trading is against TOS
---
Thanks a lot! You've been a huge help!
---
Can you even fly to Darkshore from Moonglade? Or is it because I'm a druid that I only get the free ride to Ruth'Theran and nothing else?
---
Lukewarm take: if you're constantly getting shit on by anyone as any role it's because you're a bad player and not because people don't respect people who play your role.
---
in an EU server the largest bank in norway doesn't mean shit btw
---
what % of players with bank alts are norwegian I wonder
---
I mean yes, I didn't account for the loss of dodge and parry, but even 1/4th of increased damage is merely one heal more, is it not?
---
Just the bad ones. You've been unlucky, it's not about hunters in general though.
---
Hi !
---
I was wondering it it worth the trip to go to Darkshore from Westfall as a lvl 16 human warrior ? I have finished all the quests of the area and I am eager to discover this new part of Azeroth (and maybe get closer to the horde players to engage sweet pvp ? ) :)
---
What are your advices ? ;)
---
(I deleted a post with the same question. I think asking here is a better place)
---
These bad boys are how I could afford my mount.
---
lmao dude, that argument is garbage
---
Is the felicity jones or am I stupid?
---
It is, it's also camped as hell (at least on my server) due to mages wanting to farm their own materials for crafting.
---
Imo go farm silithis for air/earth essence. Lot less competition because it's so out of the way.
---
Ofcourse they cant but I cannot explain to you how many times in the last couple of days (got in lvl range for preraid content) I had to fucking defend my decision to play a fury warrior because entitled little shits need a tank in their group. Imagine it like this.
---
Youre a Frost Mage and someone invites you into their group knowing youre a Frost Mage. Then in a couple of minutes tells you that THEY need a Fire Mage and that you should go and respec otherwise youre a dick. Entitled pricks mate they are everywhere
---
Yea i see that. I remember feeling cool with it in vanilla.
---
Sylvanas had no reservations about her place. She used the forsaken as a tool to take her revenge on Arthas, and had only taken the side of the horde because it was beneficial to her cause.
---
She acted entirely and solely for the ends of vengeance and every ally was simply a tool for that means.
---
She gets a bit more two dimensional after WotLK, but in our story so far she's pretty much just a carbon copy of The Bride from Kill Bill. Only more heartless and willing to exploit anything and everything to get her way.
---
Well it's a good thing for you that every dungeon that matters from 20-40 is in horde territory.
---
Okay, let me explain it to you for the "I dont even know what time", no one is expecting you to tank, they're telling you that you have to leave if you don't want to, is that difference so hard to understand for you?
---
How can someone force you to tank without you being in their group?
---
If youre in their group and insisting on dps, that is you trying to force them to take you as dps.
---
It goes both ways. The hunter is right for once
---
I am playing a tank, never got treated poorly by anyone
---
found the retailer
---
I have a mage alt and tried to run wc with a group. The druid in the group volunteered to tank. What followed was a shitshow. The priest didn't know how to properly heal and the hunters were constantly breaking the cc. I get why you wouldn't want to tank, a lot of inexperienced people climbing on the classic bandwagon.
---
What chat addon is that? It displays the class in chat.
---
He really doesnt seem to grasp that there is even the slightest bit of double standard there
---
Yes, that's the point I have mentioned in this thread couple of times. People insist it doesn't matter since to them speed matters: they rather run one 1hr MC run with 40 ppl then forget about it for a week giving up their drops.
---
Elvui has target of target frames and target of target of target frames.
---
I might be an asshole here but I’m kinda amused by your responses. A bit snarky, sure, but reputation ruining, nah.
---
I have not played retail for 10 years.
---
nice binds
---
Oooo sneeaakkkyyybbooiii
---
Do you grind tradeskills then drop them to grind other tradeskills?
---
Seems inefficient
---
i dont even ask. I'm a priest, I open trade, you give me water.
---
such a thing as casual WOW really exist??  like being a casual heroine addict
---
What’s the addon for displaying the class in chat?
---
No charge. What a man!
---
In the initial cluster fuck of launch my group accidently ended up on a west coast server. Sucks
---
True but if they want a specific DPS then ask for that specific DPS don't just say DPS.
---
I got 10 airs in 236 kills, 10 earths in ~350 kills. They respawn so fast it doesn't even matter if there are a few other people around.
---
Only if you forbid yourself to use the AH for whatever reason.
---
AOE spec is a lot faster (in theory).  Honestly wish I stuck with pvp spec though.  Had a lot more fun and wasn't getting burnt out like I have been with AOE.  That spec isn't ideal though, piercing ice isnt as good as frost channeling with 1 point in precision.
---
First off, I don’t give a rats ass about your stones - if I die, you’re already dead and I’ve never used a healthstone in 50 levels. Stone yourself and enjoy looking for a new group too.
---
My bitch was you expecting heals after tapping, reading comprehension ftw.
---
Your selfish attitude is why you suck period, tap away lil guy, just bandage up after and cry some more.
---
🥰
---
There are almost no druids and even fewer have the gear to tank than warriors.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
Yeah, sorry dude. I don't play classic wow so I can min/max anymore in a 15 year old instance. Lionheart Helm looks like shit, Edgemasters look like shit, so whats the point? So you can be top of the DPS meters in Molten Core or Onyxia? What a joke, I wanted an Arcanite Reaper because frankly, it's an Arcanite Reaper, nothing more needs to be said.
---
Derp nugget.. simply making a point that HoR for a Warrior is replaced by the first two handed sword that drops in BWL which drops from the first boss. Good job on that reading comprehension.
---
Warrior is also the highest DPS in the game.
---
Checkmate, Atheists.
---
Darkshore is a cool zone and there are a ton of quests there. I recommend going there
---
Just make sure you take the threat reduction talents or you will for sure die every boss fight.
---
?!?!?!?! Why do you still only want to argue based on this one point? You are still ignoring everything else I said.
---
&gt;I have had three BOEs drop since this conversation started and everyone rolled greed
---
Meaningless anecdotes. Also a bandwagon since this goal of this is to claim more people agree with you.
---
&gt;It's not a "bandwagon fallacy.
---
Saying, "that is how it currently operates" is claiming that everyone agrees with you essentially (also based only on anecdotes), and is thus a bandwagon fallacy.
---
&gt;At some point, Blizzard realized the community couldn't uphold the standard they had intended from the beginning
---
You have no proof that is how blizzard intended it should have been from the beginning! What game designer designs a game that has no mechanism to enforce the rules they intended (people who loot this way aren't even bannable unless they lied about agreeing to other loot rules), and then when there rules clearly don't working as allegedly intended they only change it after 5 years of people complaining? Some people felt back then BoE's should be treated the same as BoP's ignoring arguments to the contrary, and Blizzard decided that appeasing one party would silence the issue once and for all, that doesn't mean the other party was wrong.
---
&gt;The only reason people argue for needing on BOEs is because they argue that ninja looters should not have any opportunity of looting it
---
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS VERY THREAD ARGUING ABOUT THIS FOR OTHER REASONS INCLUDING MYSELF! HOW CAN YOU MAKE SUCH A PREPOSTEROUS STATEMENT?!?!?!!? Are you saying everyone who is promoting my point of view are not sincere or do not exist?
---
You didn't even respond to my statement saying you were ignoring my other points, you just kept talking about the same one point!
---
There are clearly situations where everyone can benefit from a BoE item equally regardless of whether that drop is intended for their class! There are also situations where items that benefit one class can benefit that same class more by being sold! A person needing to equip may be ignorantly wasting resources. I have stated these reasons and you repeatedly ignore them and instead make arguments about how you are right because it is obvious (while ignoring my points on why it is obvious valuable BoE loot should be needed by everyone), the most popular way (bandwagon),  denied the existence of my point of view, that blizzard always intended it to be that way(without citing anything), and are pretending I didn't make other arguments for why everyone should always roll for BoE loot!
---
Ignore him. He’s wrong. Druid heart of the wild build can literally do all three roles and will often find itself doing such.
---
If a piece of gear is an upgrade, of course you'll roll for it regardless if it's BiS or not, otherwise you might never upgrade that piece. Some items of gear might help with certain encounters, but ultimately you're getting that upgrade to help you fulfil your role.
---
That's not to say every single person that plays a DPS cares about doing the most DPS they can - there's always exceptions - but I'd wager the majority of them do.
---
They seriously need to implement something to discourage servers from getting so imbalanced.  They're just not fun.
---
Ok yeah I kinda took that one for granted, should've known.
---
It gets better later on, when you can pull with Hurricane or grab aggro with Tranquillity.
---
im on sulfuras and definently dont have the problem been questing, ashenvale seems like an unpopular zone but when u get to thousands needles theres alot more at least in sulfuras
---
Haha right. Im alliance, but heres the diff in my view, BOTH SIDES kill, when they outnumber their foe-or have an advantage. Its human nature.  Its either 2 (or more) vs 1, 1 vs You as you fighting a mob, you vs someone?? To you. 
---
Each side does it, and are lore likely to do it when they wont have too many  reprocessions because they have the dominant numbers at the moment.
---
I can tell you in every fight ive fought, won or lost, none of them was a straight 1 vs 1 with someone my level or similar.
---
Have you played alliance on stalagg its mythic mode!
---
Yeah. Well right now im split. I got concussion blow and have been spending the rest of my points in arms. Rn im at tactical mastery 2/5.
---
And i just got the WW axe :(
---
Looks like you did a poor job reloading that mortar
---
Are you playing HSBC bank branch simulator?
---
"Able to grind a lot" definitely matters in hardcore retail too. You had to do a ton of grinding to get your BiS benthic gear. 
---
Plus, keeping a bunch of alts fully geared up so they can trade gear to mains in split runs takes a lot of time.
---
Thanks! Will look more into that!
---
Again.. failed reading comprehension. Simply pointing out that HoJ is replaced by the first two handed weapon in BWL that drops from the first boss. i.e. meaning it has a short PvE shelf life.
---
Look at you all butthurt. The fact that you can even tank as fury says how broken warriors are in classic and as such you aren't utilizing your skill set.
---
You can dps all you like but don't act like a special child hating people because they want you to tank and tell you to get bent when you refuse.
---
Seconded
---
Farming for mats is very not worth if the value of those mats is less than the value of gold you could farm at the best gold farming spot in the same time.
---
And if it wasn't less then that mat farm would just be the best gold farming spot, so you're back to square one of just farm the best gold farm spot and buy anything you need.
---
Mate, im clearly talking pre 60
---
Druids are great offtanks in raids too, and on some raidbosses they outperform warriors.
---
I’ve a question though, does pre-hotting help for aggro? I always guessed it would, but never tested it
---
Ello ello ;-)
---
From what I’ve seen of the RP scene on EU, it feels almost like an excuse to practice their English more than anything  :)
---
if ya really wanna go back to it  the orcs were living happy lives on drenor living happily till space goats lead the burning legion to them
---
I dug out my laptop from 2011 and it struggles but it's playable. I shrank the window down to half the screen size and turned off as much of the graphics as possible. Gets me to around 60fps steady.
---
Just have to sit really close to the screen xD.
---
Just don't use nameplates if you don't like them.
---
As a rogue, if I saw a Felstriker drop, and lost the need roll to a warrior, I'd be mad. I know that they have use for it just like rogues do, but I feel like rogues should get auto priority for daggers.
---
I know it's not correct. But it's how I feel.
---
You can take the mask of the unforgiven, you can take iron foe, but leave the Felstriker for us!!
---
Yeah Tiller's looks like the answer. Updating my post.
---
There's something about farming your own mats over buying them that makes crafting it more satisfying.
---
Zandalar Tribe :D
---
Default I think
---
Heart o
---
I think casual is somewhat to do with skill level, and how much you invest into progressing/improving at a game. I would say I play wow casually. I play whenever I have nothing else to do, I don't try to min-max my efficiency in game, I don't  research the game unless its something specific like a quest or how to get an item etc. Casual is a mindset IMO.
---
Tbh, I was never really sure about this one, some caster daggers can be a huge upgrade, maybe even more than the casters need for the better stats. Wouldn't it be priority
---
Absolutely TRASH on druids.
---
Enhance shamans aren't that popular in raids, so yeah arms warriors or nothing.
---
When 40% of the enemy faction has a racial fear-break  it’s a lot harder than you might think
---
Hot bar rank 1 fort just like in vanilla for those people

He’s got a point you can just Zf farm and buy 3 or 4 essence per hr with how much gold you make. Probably much quicker than waiting on respawns.
---
Nah you gotta set your standards when you 1st join lol... Stop letting them pull. If they do drop group lol? Groups always go by the tank and healers pace not the other way around...
---
Oh okay, I haven't been playing for a while.
---
Who else would you give it to? There’s literally no one else who can use it in a good raid
---
Oi nice to see drunken flamelash players here! 🤪
---
Kobolds just want to mine peacefully and protect their candles :(
---
Look you dumb fuck if you invite me into your group AS A FUCKING DAMAGE DEALER but then later on expect me to tank for whatever fucking reason and then start talking shit after I dont want to youre a big piece of entitled steamy shit. That is the point of my post. No one can force me to tank because obviously I can leave I dont know why both you and the retarded hunter are stuck on that part but the fact that people invite warriors as dps into their groups and then actually expect them to tank just because they told them to is so fucking entitled. And its happening to pretty much every dps warrior out there.
---
Yeah only do what other people before have done a million times over, seems fun right?
---
Aren't u r Russian that lives in NY ? I guess I seen u in chatroulet.. probly I'm wrong
---
Exactly brother
---
I've rolled a 3 without yelling so....confirmed
---
I only camp twats, people who camp lowbies or kill quest NPCs or whatever.
---
Not really. BWL will be considerably harder than t1 raids, and in AQ40/Naxx shit will get real.
---
Just hit 34 on my WL yesterday. I am enjoying classic a lot more than 15 years ago. Back then I played a warrior and was raiding four nights a week. I was one of the best equiped fury warrios on arthas eu. Got sulfuras and tf, but didnt enjoy the game as much as I do now. 
---
But simetimes think about raiding again, but then I remember the massiv amount of time it consumed and that I am married now and have a job (was single and in school back in rhe old days)
---
So basically taking it slow, reading all the quests and having fun
---
Can you share how to do this? I just started a warrior.
---
Plain bullshit over here. For min maxing you won't give a raidslot to neither an enhancer nor a ret. And even if you do a 2h slam fury warrior will out dps both of them with Sulfuras. And as a warrior you need a shit ton of luck to get bis 1h weapons over your competition. For raiding you will get the most out of it by giving it to a warrior.
---
edit: even an Orc would keep it until AQ40
---
I always think it says erotic cookbook
---
Tanking for PUGs is annoying, lately when someone asks me to tank I ask for an arbitrary amount of gold (mostly 20-50g, depending on mood and dungeon) and people are paying up surprisingly often.
---
Hey team,
---
Does anyone know if refer a friend is active or coming back? Would like to join a pal but waiting till this is a thing again...
---
I am actually interested in hearing of the probability of this NOT happening to one guild . With all the runs occurring,  I bet it is very low.
---
If you frost aoe it yes, otherwise you’ll need to take it kinda slow
---
Yeah it only lasts 5 seconds, and he used to to kill the priest. After he came at me i hit him with a 5 second stun too
---
How can you zoom so much out? Do you use an Addon?
---
If they start going a little too hardcore on aoe i pull out some dps gear and dual wield tank.  Better to take a little bit more damage and hold most the mobs than have headless chickens running all over the place.
---
Male night elves can't use bows. True story.
---
Better than when the questgiver tells me to go kill 15 ogres in that camp to the east. When there's 10 ogres in total.
---
what time zone are you in, that will matter some. I am on blaumeux, dont think there are streamers on there least none that I know of.
---
They are absolutely steaming by the end 😂 cracking video!
---
So you mean zones like duskwood that’ll easily get you to the 20s? I see what you mean
---
.6. Profit???
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
DUSKWOOD
---
Him joining the group with that initial LF DPS condition is equivalent to signing a name to the contract with terms already specified.
---
In the metaphor I am trying to give you here the moment he joins the contract IS in effect. This is called an Active Contract and you cannot change the parameters without agreement of BOTH parties.
---
Come to Fairbanks, it's a great community
---
It took you so long to kill it that all the blood spilled out.
---
That is one of the biggest factors yes.
---
People not understanding that I cant do massive amounts of damage on 4 different mobs in like first 2 seconds of the fight or one of my favourites when you have 3 dps that all attack a different target. Just wonderful. But also I just dont enjoy tanking. Never have and probably never will.
---
What class won the Felstriker?
---
DUSKWOOD EXISTS HELLO
---
The skipping of mobs is so stupid.
---
Had a tank today who asked the group to pass on Scourgestones so he could get to friendly for the buff food for his raid in the evening. He proceeded to carefully maneuver around as many mobs as possible. And since it was Strat UD you can imagine how well that went.
---
Should have just killed them all, collect 5 rep per mob for everyone and very likely be just as fast since our dps was pretty good in that run.
---
IMO it's only a lot harder if the faction split on your server is greater than 40/60 in Horde's favour. My server seems to be be around 50/50 regarding faction balance and I only experience more ganks when hanging around in Horde-dominant zones. Otherwise counterganks are pretty frequent. Making the effort to find a group to quest together also makes the skirmishes less unfair.
---
I farmed 8 essence in a hour at the mobs
---
It tells me a lot that you haven't used a health stone given to you. Like, a lot.
---
Like that you waste your mana when you could click the stone and save yourself and your group. I wonder how many wipes you could have prevented by eating that health stone.
---
You should probably learn to play better and not assume that every warlock is the kind that willy nilly life taps themselves to 10% health mid pull and won't even blink at their Drain Life button.
---
Also if I have the soul stone, I just stand back up and laugh again. And the group wonders why you didn't click the health stone I gave you that could have put you back at 100% health and saved the wipe.
---
Boars without livers, though?
---
You can try playing full screen, but turn down render resolution.
---
Would be blurry, but at least bigger window.
---
listen, you're acting like a littl crybaby because someone uses the same farming method as you :( 
---
How can they not use the best min-maxed way to make gold? Can you imagine what an asshole you'd be to not try hard as hard as you can?
---
I'm from Brazil, one hour ahead of eastern time
---
Excellently put, complete agree.
---
I see lots of people saying it sucks for warrior but no one saying who it would be better for
---
Friend and I have a bs and alchemist betweeen us. Made the required items. Bought the eng one and farmed these elementals in about an hour for the first part. 30 minutes for the rest of the chain. But now we are proud owners of a stopwatch each. That and the carrot will probably be all I have till I start farming my BiS next week.
---
I remember doing this and the name plates wouldn't work on NPCs at the time so I had to click each npc to see their health.
---
and I can only assume that a 60 year old woman who is not part of the instant gratification generation might actually enjoy playing the game as it was originally intended to be played.
---
Are you saying you'd rather not bother with that talent and just have a resto shaman instead? Or are you saying you'd rather have a shaman take that talent, and just wear resto gear?
---
It’s not an add on you just have to type in a console command. 
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" -- turn on class colours
---
How big is your server there’s always like 10 ppl there and pvp going on when I drive by .
---
We do like them. We want them to be viewable from a distance greater than 20 yards.
---
/2 because this is how change starts. Give in to the bitches who cant even cope with one thing. I hope blizzard turns their cheek to the babies. 
---
Learn to fucking target.
---
Whats the market price addon?
---
lol same, 27
---
I paid my 1st mount on vanilla farming all that shit. It was the best I knew at the time.
---
Incendius so high-pop, late night early mornings it's not that bad.
---
There is difference between a challenge and just fighting the ui for no reason.
---
Look at you thinking that I have a problem not being a part of a group that doesnt want a dps warrior.
---
But if you dont see anything wrong with inviting me as a dps then expecting me to tank youre a big steamy pile of entitled shit and you can go go go fuck yourself
---
Just tank dungeons as 2h arms and rage issues disappear.
---
I dream of BC-style itemisation and talent trees but with classic worldbuilding approach.
---
In vanilla i was in the top horde guild on my server, we never saw even a single eye or binding drop. Meanwhile we had a more casual guild on the server that only raided MC that had 5 hand of rag's and one TF at the end of vanilla.
---
Some guilds are lucky, others not so much.
---
Too bad you’re wrong and Horde/alliance is almost exactly 50/50 in retail 
---
https://realmpop.com/eu.html
---
THE MOTHER
---
Intercept, 2 bleeds and most of all execute or overpower if they think dodge is going to help them. I have played fury since launch and rogues almost always die. Their best hope is for backup to arrive.
---
Yes, and those terms are "accept the group leaders calls or gtfo of the group".
---
You have to pretend to be retarded to understand reddit posts.  He means the one that is a straight line, so get off in auberdine and then click through again.
---
WW axe is best on Horde, but Alliance can skip it by going from Corpsemaker (RFK drop blue axe) straight into Bonebiter.
---
I’m a tank and 99% of the time I run my own groups and set the pace. I prefer to pull at a quick pace with little downtime and skip what trash we can. There are better ways to get Exp and gold just by playing the game solo than killing a few extra trash packs during instances. Am I really that wrong for wanting to spend 40 mins in a run instead of an hour? I don’t even complain when 90% of the groups attack on charge instead of after I get 1-2 seconds of threat built. I just wanna get the run done quick, efficiently and get everyone home. I get there are newer players that want to experience the instance, well.. sorry but I’ve been there and done that many times. If I notice a group is newer I’ll take it easier. I can’t remember getting more than 2 complaints leveling to 60 tanking like this. Almost never marked until ST and up either
---
Thanks all for the answer, I don’t know what to do haha
---
If i can sell them 700g i think I would it’s crazy money
---
Horde are some ugly mafs
---
One of the reasons I play undead is to be less noticed in PvP, while I then go around killing everyone.
---
a lot of shit was doable in vanilla.
---
He made that character with a plan!
---
It doesn’t exist.
---
Heart of the wild spec, 30/21 feral/resto will suit you for solid tanking/healing experience at 60 and your cat form performance with it is not completely terrible either for solo farming.
---
The true asshole thing is to take mobs/nodes in the open world from classes that can't farm dungeons effectively just because you want to "play the game your way"
---
It is selfish, like most mages are
---
I'm too far invested in stalaag to jump ship now but the horde are brutal. I get chopped up in stv just running into bb
---
I learnt recently that negative numbers can happen, wtf?
---
EDIT: I assume I'm getting down voted due to disbelief, but I swear to god. Unless it was a hack.
---
More of this please
---
For sure. Easy 5 levels.
---
Balance druid aren't viable. Poor moon Chickens. Luckily they got real good in TBC! But in classic, by far the worst spec.
---
Every other spec is viable though.
---
Doesn't matter if the tank is Iffy, they are still a Tank OP isn't. Sure they can kick him but on what grounds "A dps specced Warrior without the proper gear or talents won't tank for us..." pretty entitled.
---
As for it not being a contract... that was a metaphor lol in order to get the logic across. Oh btw, since you are replying in this comment thread I originally proposed in my initial reply a what if scenario that OP joined a "LF 1 DPS and GTG" group so the group in question have a tank.
---
I have 2 characters level 30, a priest and paladin. I got one mid 20s, a mage and a level 19, a hunter. Current plan is to have 1 of each class level 30 before I push to 60 on one character. I'm leaning toward going to 60 on a mage because I never played one in vanilla and I'm having a blast trying the aoe leveling method. Haven't done any aoe dungeon grinding yet, may attempt it later.
---
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time, let's not get too judgemental. I think they were harmless in WoD.
---
It adds up. Berserker stance is 20% more damage when compared to defensive, deathwish is another 10%, Ravager proc means no dodge/parry and full dps gear (no stamina and half of it being leather) just seals the deal.
---
Congrats! Thats a great first run drop.
---
Mm, yes, the point of this game/universe DOES fly right over most people's stupid small heads.
---
If you time it right both gouge and deathcoil can go off, giving time for deathcoil to wear off before they can cast fear.  Now you can kick their fear to prevent it.
---
Is that really so? I've been struggling to get into dungeon groups as a priest because there's always 2-3 other priests also looking for the same dungeon
---
I wish they had only allowed transfers for alliance players from Stalagg. Instead, we have a terrible faction balance
---
I'm not the slightest bit wrong. Overall population is 50/50, you're correct.
---
However, that's because PvE/RP realms are Alliance dominated and PvP realms are Horde dominated. It events out to 50/50 overall but if you play on a PvP realm (which is what we're talking about in this thread), Alliance is the underdog.
---
The reason RealmPop doesn't divide by PvP realms anymore is because of Warmode, a feature introduced in BfA. It essentially removes the idea of pve and pvp realms - you now toggle at will whether you want to play PvE or PvP. 
---
And for the record, Alliance participation in Warmode (ie PvP realms) was so incredibly low that Blizzard had to introduce special incentives for Alliance to turn it on, including 30% experience boost and heroic raid gear. And even with those incentives, Horde STILL outnumber Alliance in Warmode in BfA.
---
Idk. I also like how they charge 1g for a portal but got no issues taking lock summons for free all the time
---
I mean it shows that they are able to pool some very large amounts of gold which shows dedication to farming
---
Main tank can be easily geared first with any loot system.
---
this is the border I'm talking about:
---

I clicked hide border but it removed a different border.
---
Female undead have primo animations
---
Tauren are big fuckers, large and in charge. They can ford most rivers without even dismounting!
---
60% of the time, it works every time.
---
Come to Thunderfury. It's like 35-40/60-65 alliance to Horde which isn't too bad. Only STV is really bad.
---
Meanwhile I mass murdered nerds, solo camped region pipes with smart bombing alts, stole billions of isk from WH corps I joined ECT ECT. Every Corp I applied to loved me and wanted me to run some ops and have access to srp ships. I even handled the AT funds and ships for one group I was with. Crazy bastards.
---
I guess it was because I streamed and people knew who I was, or maybe the fact that I wasn't hiding anything? Just shows we all have different experiences.
---
Commenting to find this post later
---
Or if you're an undead rogue, or a blacksmith with the trinket.
---
Well thats a tough one. Guess complaining will have to suffice! Poor guy :(((((
---
Look at you.
---
Not only do you want someone to tank you also want to choose which class it is.
---
Maybe even make him respec because you dont approve of some talents of his?
---
Exactly. Expecting tips from randos in the city’s or around the world who go out of there way to supply you is perfectly reasonable. But charging your group for water is similar to a paladin charging for blessings(which cost money at endgame), fortitude(same), etc. it’s just not kosher.
---
Nah man on this sub poor QoL = a gameplay “challenge”
---
Different issue, but to piggyback off this, Warriors are the best DPS as well as the best tanks for this phase. More than half of us roll Warrior specifically to DPS and we do not enjoy tanking, mostly because of the reasons you mentioned. 
---
As a DPS-only Warrior, it's extremely annoying to get hounded by random messaged asking me to tank. It's one thing if I am inside SM and you see me shouting and wonder if I'd be willing to tank, that's perfectly reasonable. Messaging me in Orgrimmar when I am already in a group asking me to come tank SM infuriates the shit out of me though. If a tank wants to tank and do your dungeon, he will either shout "Tank LFG X" or start his on group. Don't bother us randomly, the shit is annoying.
---
As OP said, if DPS didn't instantly start AoE while we are still LoSing mage mobs, and the healer didn't throw a hot and big overheal on us at 90% health, maybe I wouldn't mind tanking, but I did that shit from 12-25 and it made me want to blow my brains out. Watching the other DPS do the same shit 25+ has shown me I made the right call. I don't want to tank for the people that play this game. It's not fun, and no one wants to do right.
---
16 minutes video to show me the most popular addons in Curseforge.
---
I don’t think people have fully adjusted to Classic in terms of tanking.  It’s so much more difficult than I remember it being.  I started in Burning Crusade, and played through mists and always had a knack for tanking and usually got a lot of praise for doing a great job, but in Classic it’s so much more difficult.  It also feels like I never have enough rage, and then when you don’t have enough rage you don’t generate enough rage to generate more rage.  (Druid Tank.). You can ask DPS to just wait like 3 seconds every pull but usually they’re unloading before I even get to the mobs.  It is pretty frustrating, but luckily so far up through 45 I haven’t run into many dungeons were this was a huge issue.
---
When you get to level 50 and leveling normally will take you fucking ages per level, you'll be practically begging for AOE runs :)
---
My logical brain wants to believe you, but why do I see everytime there's majority Alliance on Booty Bay boat, the Horde guys get left alone, while the reverse never happens.
---
Isn't it better to not move from the battlemaster so you can requeue instantly?
---
Has anyone thought that perhaps our guild has not had a single warrior weapon drop from 8 Onyxia and 7 Ragnaros kills (in either raid team).
---
Not trying to attack you, but its funny to me that we put effort into getting some of our pvpers a good weapon when Rag loves to drop his Pure Essence trinket and Onyxia loves to drop Grimoires.
---
100% Hx and Qoth would be rocking Spinal Reapers or BRE's if they had dropped, and at this rate, theres about 10 other warriors in guild that just shot up in priority to get them
---
Whenever I tank for a group I try my best to do my job in keeping threat and peeling for my team mates.
---
But mosty I just cba tell every hunter to turn off growl or every mage to wait with aoe until I secured threat. Same with people ignoring kill orders etc. You get the point.
---
My rule of thumb is, as long as the party doesn't die and the healer can keep up, everything is good and no need to start correcting people or be all insensitive about it and start pointing fingers. 
---
As long as we make it through the instance, I'm fine
---
thanks will have a look =)
---
you need a decent amount of gear to farm zf. people get tired of doing gear runs at 60... sometimes groups arent forming or taking forever to fill. sometimes people are retarded and dont know how to aoe farm at all. why do so many players tell others how to play like the game would be any fun if we all did the exact same things all day.
---
What’s the pr in chat? Is that like dkp? And what addon is he using to distribute the loot.
---
If you think frost counters enhance you're an idiot.
---
Shamans straight up destroy mages.
---
Hahahaha, nobody cares to justify how good a purchase something is. Maybe you should chill out on the game and stop being a goofy little stat-chaser in a 15 year old game. Looking at your post history, seems like you've already burnt yourself out because you wanted to be the very best and optimally geared warrior you could be, now you've ran out of content to do while you sit around and twiddle your thumbs until phase 2.
---
It's a video game, and you're supposed to do the things you want. Have fun running around with your Dreadforge Retaliator like every other warrior. I got my Arcanite Reaper lmao.
---
Which means they have taxed their guild members actually. This is why I raised the question why would any hardcore (farming w/e) player join them if he knows they are going milk him for an exposure.
---
I think the issue is that everyone started at the same time; and most players are all around the same level range.  My server is still full, with layers; and any zone under level 40 is a ghost town.  The average player is 45-60 by this point.  We have many guilds that have been clearing MC and Ony for weeks, and seeing level 60’s on their epic mounts is becoming “normal”.  
---
I’m a middle aged married man with a lot less time to play than in the past(filthy casual); and I’m at 57 with over 100 level 60’s in my guild.
---
A smart guild with 2.. I doubt they have any trouble getting people to join. Means they have it on clear and have people willing to spend some real time farming to benefit the guild
---
The person who took the pic won both. (It’s not me but my guildie.)
---
What tip?
---
There's a huge difference between randomly grouping with someone and asking for 6 stacks of water and expecting them as part of a dungeon run. 
---
If a mage in my dungeon group is trying to sell water to the healer/casters, I give him a chance to change his mind or I replace him. 
---
In the open world however, it's totally fair game to charge, just because I accepted an invite from you doesn't mean I should also spend the next 5+ minutes spawning water for you. You're a stranger, he doesn't owe you anything.
---
FYI, 120 vendor water would have cost you about 2g40s. More than twice as much as this guy asked you for. He wasn't the asshole here.
---
PS: And pls don't respec for dungeons, it's a huge waste of gold. I only respecced 21/30/0 when I started healing MC. All dungeons are healable as Shadow. In fact I'm not surprised you're being stingy about 1g if you literally respec for every dungeon.
---
I remember I created an undead after Cataclysm and in the starting zone you have a quest to eliminate the undead that chose to oppose the Dark Lady. So much for free will, that was always a facade and the Forsaken have been like a totalitarian regime in that regard. 
---
Dark lady watch over you.
---
Combat attack proc is very good especially on horde with windfury. About as good as arms warriors. Don't forget to vanish to reset threat
---
Well it actually mostly depends on your dps and their threat management and 99% of dps couldnt give a flying fuck about that
---
hit 22 on my druid this weekend, i’m feeling pretty good about it!
---
There's a reason I only pug tank for gold. I don't really see any of those things as issues though. Once the mage, or who over pulled, dies you have nearly full rage and an ae taunt. Hit that bad boy and toss out those sunders and you shouldn't wipe.
---
IMO a huge part of a prot warriors job in a dungeon group is debuffs, far more than holding agro. Sure try and tank but thunderclap and demo shout will go much further in speeding up a run than actually tanking will. Alter your mindset away from "must have aggro at all times" and to "must keep as many debuffs up as possible" and you will have smother and more enjoyable runs.
---
Yo I love your setup!
---
Berserker stance is a non-issue since both our wars use that. You don't spec fury when 2h tanking, because the reason you 2h tank is for Sweeping Strikes, else your tank is ehhmmm yeah..
---
Don't know what 'ps gear' is? But I recon agi+str? This is where the most difference comes from: DW and leather :D
---
While mine uses plate and SS, less meta, but way easier for the healer. I wouldn't want to swap tanks to heal haha
---
Female UD have good movement, casting, and attack animations
---
The armor is so small, such weak pauldrons :(
---
I bring stacks of water when I tank PUGs because healers running out of drinks is everyone's problem.  I'd love to get 100 from you anytime.
---
I mean if they've been recruiting I think a position in HR is for them.  Maybe "HR specialist II"?
---
Why assume it's singles?  Cld just have easily been full stacks tho.
---
I do get carried away sometimes, but honestly just out of patience when it comes to the Confess Boots of Avoidance thing.
---
Confess has been a great guildie, the entire raid team can confirm. The guy is not evil. Could the situation in ZF been handled better? Sure. But he's a good dude, and I'm willing to die on that hill.
---
Shhhh, the plot wills it.
---
Usually see a lot of priest starting AOE spam groups because healers can be hard to find. But i've always found a dungeon in like 10 minutes when i start to look. Been shadow a few times too do.
---
It’s stupid. Why would you take out your phone and snap a low quality picture when you can just press PrintScrn / Win+Shift+S / other key combinations (like Microsoft game bar). Not to mention that you have to focus in with your phone, overall it takes 5 times as much time and effort for worse results.

exactly imagine how much fun this game would be if everyone just did the exact same thing as everyone else lol id quit tomorrow. nothing interesting would ever be happening
---
I like to pretend the party all brings it to the quest giver together
---
Just go down the list of realms and you’ll see that you’re wrong, this whole thread is confirmation bias to the max
---
If the DPS have Ravager or use Blizzard, tanking with Ravager is the only way they can keep threat. They can put on a shield and hit one mob as the rest run over and hit you and the dps, but the mobs won't stay on them long enough to generate the Rage they need to keep threat. Some big 2H crits generate good rage and/or a Ravager proc will help them hold threat. 
---
The 37-45 bracket may be rough for healers, but it's not like the warriors have any other choice if you want them to keep threat. This is why I don't want to tank on my warrior. It's not fun and we have limited options if we want to even keep threat on half the mobs. If you get reasonable people who will wait 10 seconds before they AoE, that's amazing and your way is great. Normally, it won't work though.
---
So many tinfoil hats regarding legendaries and streamers, this guild doesnt have any big streamers and they have two hand of rags.

Didnt bought shamans purge till late game... And i was on PvP all day. What a noob!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Ill take the black roses.

One of the best DPS in phases 1-2-3. Please do note it's still DPS, so better if you have tank friend available.

Keanufreeze
---
Ah but you see if the force him to Tank or leave when they also had an open DPS slot he joined for, then they are still making him unhappy. Going by the logic in the comment I replied to making someone unhappy = your an asshole.
---
So your point is?
---
No laws
---
On my overpopulated realm? Good luck ;)

The robe is BoP once you make it lolol he cants makes shit off the robe he's make more off selling the mats and never getting the pattern please learn the game before you trash people
---
I don’t know from experience, but I’ve seen people on here say that Kromcrush is pretty balanced.
---
I tanked SM lib a while ago and had a blast with an AOE mage, 2 dps shamans and a priest. After noticing that the mage will AOE spam and pull aggro from many mobs.
---
**I adapted:**
---
- told the shamans to setup/move their camp and that I would be bringing mobs to their camp
---
- told the priest to keep an eye on the mage as I will loose aggro on some mobs
---
- made sure that I used demoralising roar on all mobs
---
- used feral charge on mobs that were getting close to the mage
---
- never told a thing to the mage as he was playing perfectly in his own style and doing good DPS  
---
**The end result... everyone got to play their class like they wanted:**
---
- shamans got to enjoy their totems without having to constantly spend mana for moving them
---
- priest had a bit more to do than to just stare at a single HP bar
---
- the mage was AOE spamming and kiting the juice out of the mobs, that had to run back and forth around the totem camp while being slowed or immobilized or stunned
---
- I was busy pulling, debuffing, stunning, taunting and making sure that the priest had always mana for the next encounter 
---
Tanking is more than ‘just holding aggro’. It’s about 
---
mitigating the damage that the enemy does and maximising the damage your team does. You don’t always get to pick your team mates so improvise, adapt and overcome!
---
There is not a coincidence that they added Blood Elves to horde. Statistics probably told them they needed a pretty race to diversify the player base. Alliance later got Worgen.
---
I don't get this. I'm having a blast. Mindcontrol is such an incredibly fun and versatile ability, and my trusty bubble and wand makes me wreck mobs with literally zero downtime. I never drink and I haven't died in 5 levels. I've read comments like yours several times so I was pretty scared of the leveling but I'm having so much fun and I'm level 34.
---
Test
---
If it works it works
---
CNN fake news was right, we need a final solution for the neckbeards lest they ruin TBC too.
---
I had to read this comment to them go back and understand what was going on
---
my friend i can link you a picture too:

---
come on, man.
---
I'd advise you to use the Spy addon. It tracks both deaths and kills of certain player. You can also add people to a KoS list (kill on sight), which notifies you when the player is in area you are. The addon also tracks every person in the opposing faction in your area and announces enemies that go stealth, kinda cheap but its helpful to label enemies that had wronged you.
---
Pro tip; I already manage my anger by not giving into baser instincts.
---
It’s literally just a comment. Save your salt for yourself.
---
Well that's a bummer. Maybe pickpocketing brd would be better gold per hour in your specific case.
---
r is autorun first thing i did
---
Do you know anyone who might already have the game installed? It’s possible to throw the WoW file into a drive and transfer onto your computer. You can then direct the game client to where the game is located.
---
Yeah, I mean it's probably closer to 1:10 or 1:11 ratio.  But you also forget that for 5 man content in classic it's perfectly easy to throw on a shield and tank as fury as well.
---
I haven't created the character yet. I'm trying to decide between warrior or paladin, using sword and shield, that's best for pvp dungeons raids etc.
---
I am selling fish, and i am happy. 35 level and almost 400 gold i have now.
---
I remember seeing Thebulk (Tauren warrior?) back in TBC. World is tiny!
---
Horde can't attack you if you're also horde.
---
I can't get the first excersize to work somehow... Nothing happens when i log in with my character and typing /run Sandbox.lua gives the same result
---
Last Night I got chased by a horde warrior for like over 10 mins while turning in a quest so eh not always true
---
That is not even close to worth it lmao
---
5~ days or so is the 'average' for some of the more experienced players. If you're super dedicated you can probably do it in two or three days. 
---
Obviously there is no real answer, because it all depends on how much fun you are having leveling up, whether you're bothering with professions/dungeons and a bunch of other factors.
---
makes a difference what server you are on.  i recently started over on a different server and prices are very different.  for example on the server i left rumsey rum black label was 4 silver and it is over 40 silver on the new server.  i just buy all my abilities now and have money left over.  so if i were to have not been on the first server id be telling you to do this or that which would not apply to your server
---
sounds like you are on a server that isnt inflated yet.  before i moved i just picked a quest to work on that involved mobs that dropped items i could vendor.  gold started flowing in alot easier after 40 it felt like.
---
just keep leveling and saving.  the higher the mobs you kill the more the value of their loot, and the rate of gold increases.
---
come over 'eeer and I'll bite'cha
---
&gt;And people playing classic understand that tanks have limited tools in their kits.
---
Thats mighty generous of you
---
It is not possible to tie an infinite amount of times due to how computer random number generators work. Providing a different seed to each roll will guarantee a different sequence of numbers.
---
You seem a little salty over the fact that you wasted a lot of gold, man. It’s gonna be okay!
---
Ah, here I am getting the one that resets rogue abilities. I would go for premeditation, but a guide I saw goes into combat after I'm going sub rogue
---
Oh! Or you could try getting stonescale eels at feathermoon stronghold. If you have alchemy either make stonescale oil or better yet flask of the titans! If that's too rich for ya even the 2000 armor elixir might sell pretty good
---
Sad, pitiful little man.
---
You know... nothing much, just suffering as usual
---
Yup, you’re right, my bad, long night, it’s spirit tap I have points in.
---
Loves Nirvana, that lad.
---
Well it depends on what you want to achieve, if you want to be a tank in PvP, which is viable I’d say roll paladin because of the utility with bubble and heals. In dungeons and raids I’d say warrior
---
Thanks dude. I may as well grind on priest and just every few days jump on the Alt for a few hours. I’ll just bank the farmed mat’s as you said.
---
Winter Squid is more expensive now than Stonescale eel ;)
---
I've got a 47 rogue and a 32 warlock so far. The rogue is my main and the lock my alt, although I'm more interested in pvp on the rogue and pve on the lock, so it should probably have been the other way around since BGs will be a while yet. I fret about that a little bit every day, but other than that, I'm having a good time.
---
I appreciate it!
---
^ dudes not even 60 it’s October 6 lol
---
Well you can go skinn beats for thick leather..you should be able to farm lvl 50 pretty well. Other than that you can make use of lw
---
Creatures with small brains tend to have thicker skulls. ;)
---
I'm alliance on Grob and I pass many horde on the roads in Ashenvale that are heading toward certain death at the hands of 5+ alliance. I don't know how to warn them, so I just wave at them and shake my head in real life.
---
Nice video and gameplay style. I'm going to play balance / hybrid as well and I would like to see your talents because right now Im going to 30/0/21, but wow yours looks pretty good too
---
The fuck does your comment even mean
---
/Reload :)
---
tbh mouse steering can get painful if its around the tight stairways of the big tower in orgg and the zepplin towers. that's why i won't bind. q and e are very convenient keys don't get me wrong but shift and 1-5 and f serve me well enough for now. i will click for things like summoning minions or food water bandages on the right side action bar.
---
How about re evaluating your life to not be such a dick going around ganking ppl, at least till you actually get something out of it other than trying to screw someone over.
---
Thought it was a good Idea to respec for aoe farming, forgot ICE Barrier. Had to respec again this time with ICE Barrier. Aoe farmed for 10 minutes before i got bored with it. Respecced again for single target.
---
And that ladies and gents is how i wasted 30 Gold.
---
For a warrior I’d pick Tauren but for everything else I’d go undead.
---
RIP Lailokong’s 15
---
What do you mean mages are the new hunters? This is my first wow experience and I'm on a 19 mage.
---
Thanks for some clarification, but it still sounds like slower weapon speed isn’t actually better in those cases - higher weapon damage is. Seems like there’s not situation where two weapons with equal damage favor the one with a “higher” (aka slower) speed.
---
Totally makes sense to go for higher damage weapons for the ability procs, though.
---
that's a dogshit comparison and you know it. how about instead of a damageless chicken adding 3% crit to 4 warlocks, we literally just bring a whole nother warlock also spamming shadow bolts that can crit??? do you honestly think oomkin plus 4 warlocks will out dps 5 warlocks
---
what's up with this subreddit full of armchair theorycrafters that evidently never played the game
---
Atharv here, stumbled upon this at work. Glad to see the hoedown went well!
---
Solidarity from a fellow altoholic. Good character names.
---
They haven’t sold 161 in years. Stopped making it. College kids everywhere shed a tear.
---
Head in a bag. That’s the message.
---
A majority of people were still using a and d to turn their characters back then. Not only was the content unknown but just the mechanics of the game were still getting figured out.
---
Nope on the chests. I’m not unlocking it if I can’t have the contents. I didn’t see them swimming circles in swamp of sorrows or going in brd to pick doors with me to get the required skill. I’ll lie and say I can’t and come back later. They aren’t gonna share their mines or herbs with me so why do they get to roll on my professions?
---
Yeah maybe if you shoot and then stand still, but you're suppose to kite the add till it's picked up
---
Reminds me of the death knight from Nixxiom's machinima videos.
---
Or theyre not retarded and target the mob that has a stack of sunder...
---
Deathbringer is so unbelievably above and beyond Mirah's I can't tell if this a troll post of not
---
If they were both 40 dps, Mirah's would be marginally better, like absolutely minimally better
---
Instead it's much, much worse because DB has such a ludicrous dps advantage over it
---
Also, why not MH deathbringer for massive WW chunks?
---
Firstly, play how you want to play and don't let what other people think change that. Especially if it only about a mount.
---
Also, don't stress about the gold. I'm level 42 and I'm still 15g short. It is getting quicker and quicker each level to earn gold. You'll get there.
---
It’s like a 1% DPS increase, but yes it’s a DPS incrase for a rogue.
---
tbh like its not a huge deal if you want to do an instance just fly there and walk of you need to quest same thing
---
its a bigger deal when you need to go different places all the time
---
just dont buy anything till you have the gold just gear from quests
---
Those are weird looking ret paladins.
---
Make a second panel of them going back the other direction.
---
shut up Meg
---
I unsubbed re subbed and then unsubbed again just to show them how upset I am
---
Holy shit ya boi UberDanger is back
---
You’ve posted this already
---
"Or something" leaves it open for interpretation.
---
Get creative OP.
---
It is, but mages can do much better, so any mage in that spot is:
---
a) limiting himself
---
b) taking a good farming spot another class might need
---
Not an excuse to be an ass like the guy in the screenshot, but he isn't wrong, either.
---
If you’re good with math, just flipping on the auction house
---
Nothing really. You will always pull most likely. I found that if you open with hunters mark I auto shot in between attack roughly 2-3 times
---
What guilds are doing 3+ mc splits a week already?
---
Wow. Calling TotalBiscuit an "outrage merchant" and putting him in the same category as fucking Asmongold? That's the level we're at? Cool. He makes a few good points but they drown in a sea of his own thinly veiled superiority complex. This guy doesn't seem to get classic at all, I feel like he just wasted 40 minutes of my life.
---
Shouldn't weapon speed normalization counteract that?
---
&gt; just dont buy anything till you have the gold just gear from quests
---
That's' what all the YouTube videos on the subject seem to say, yes.  That it's more about saving than anything else.
---
That sounds really awesome! But I'm 4 hours ahead, probably will not catch you guys online
---
There's an off-hand that damages you in exchange for a speed boost, you could weapon swap into that then back out afterward.
---
Fishing was the way I did it.  It was more enjoyable instead of killing mobs for hours on end
---
What are your professions? I loved the turtles in Hinterland: good amount of greys, cookable meat, you can skin them.
---
I don't think Slam is any more tedious than HS queue/cancel which is the reason 2H fury isn't competitive.
---
but today, 6 weeks after launch, me and my other half finally dinged level 60 together and it was such a great moment! We both played WoW hardcore back in the days before we met, and now we got to experience it all together. Love it!
---
 why the downvotes? a bunch of gatekeepers telling someone to play in a way while theyve played before so they're allowed to use questie.  what baloney
---
Short answer? Yes.
---
How you only have 15g at level 36 is beyond me. Spending g on gear before level 40 is unnecessary if you complete the right quests and dungeons. Do you use your professions to make money? or sell items on AH? Don't buy a horse because you're worried about what other people think, get it because it makes questing and everything else so much easier and faster. Quality of life is very important.
---
Think he will post until it blows up
---
ill be looking these up when i get home...
---
Druid tanks are strictly superior to warriors up until bosses start
---
1.  getting enrage mechanics as such bosses will chew through anyone without the ability to block or use defensive CDs
---
2.  being "boss" leveled as it treats them as being three levels higher than you and +def leather is too scarce to avoid to resulting crits and only shield block is capable of nullifying crushing blows.
---
After that though bears become the best offtank due to their incredibly high threat gen and the fact they don't steal tank gear, rogue leathers, or healer leathers.
---
Paladin here. I blessed hunters with Might through all of vanilla and BC. Just checked the tooltip. I’m an idiot, and so are the hundreds or thousands of hunters through the years that never asked me what the fuck I was doing.
---
Savoury Deviate Delight seems to be a big seller; but I assume you're also talking about sagefish and the other buff foods as well, yes?
---
If the drop rate was 3-5% then most guilds would have them. This makes no sense
---
First you have to catch us on our epic mounts. See you in 1000g bud
---
Why did he whisper you?
---
Can you set the guild name too instead of just player name?
---
Badlands has one purpose and that’s to get broken tooth if you’re a hunter.
---
Wow this is incredible. I’m waiting for the next volume in the series! Lmao
---
Dude I asked two, very simple questions and you blew a fuckin gasket. Go ahead, read all my Reddit shit, that confronts me none. I give a flying fuck about you, which is why I *didnt* look at your profile.
---
Believe what you want or don’t, it’s no hair off my sack either way. 
---
You’re a douche canoe, point blank. 
---
And I don’t need any help, thanks for playing online psychiatrist though, better luck next time.
---
Almost my entire income is from fishing, roughly 20-30g a day, combined with some alchemy. It's not trash money, it's lots of little transactions so it's not the same as farming big money items like black lotus, it's more about consistency.
---
Edit: 30g a day from that alone, not counting other loot.
---
Multiboxer
---
Ehancement Shaman (Horde), Retribution Paladin (Alliance). One of the reasons is that the weapon proc is affected by spellpower.
---
Yeah you have a resto shaman go deep enhance to pick that up, please dont talk about things which you have little understanding. its the worse dps spec in the game in pve.
---
Weakauras
---
Oh so you need to rely on complete luck, gotcha.
---
I started at 5600 mana and usually get on OK, have to use mana gem most times and clear casts help
---
The current content was never *that* tough during original vanilla though
---
Why ? They are the class that benefit most from this weapon.
---
&gt; Do you use your professions to make money?
---
I was going to do mining, but the price of most metals is in the toilet on our server, to the point where it hardly seems worth it.  Copper bars are barely 1s each.
---
13:24 PST 10 September 2019. Still no thanks.
---
Horde doesn’t go their beyond running to badlands lol there’s literally 0 content
---
Besides, blizzard made ally zones first and then the horde after as an afterthought lmao
---
You absolutely do not need the best gear to tank. You don’t even need to be spending gold on any gear upgrades till end game.
---
I killed him once in stv, we were same lvl
---
Baron’s deathcharger reins are pretty much out of the realm of realistic chance. 0.02% in classic is it? Really low odds.
---
Except you aren't answering the question. Why is BRE better?
---
So he has more than one account and switched to it to whisper you? Lol!
---
Ouch. What a waste.
---
ill upvote that because yea a good mage should do exactly what i just said, your an idiot.
---
Maybe its time for you to delete reddit as well?
---
I personally live on Central Time, but the guild is more active later at night. I tend to play at odd hours compared to most.
---
He choose to play the class he wanted despite its flaws and I chose mine(despite its flaws) as it may be annoying i should not be limited to what I can do in the game because the fact I play a good aoe class.
---
Already funded my mount, but easy to obtain, I’ll start hoarding more.
---
3% drop rate; 7 trials.
---
* 81% chance to find 0 eye
---
* 17% chance to find 1 eye
---
* 2% chance to find 2 eye
---
7 clears is a lot if you're a tight-nit guild with less than 50 level 60s. It's really not that much if you have enough players to run 2-3 groups weekly.
---
Let's extrapolate to a year at 2 runs / week. 3% drop rate; 104 trials.
---
* 4% chance to find 0 eye
---
* 13% chance to find 1 eye
---
* 22% chance to find 2 eyes
---
* 23% chance to find 3 eyes
---
* 18% chance to find 4 eyes
---
* 11% chance to find 5 eyes
---
* 6% chance to find 6 eyes
---
A guild that runs MC only once a week will make 1-2 hammers / year.
---
Is your tank a blacksmith so you can keep yourself fairly well equipped? If so I managed to make almost all my gold in a few days just selling leveling BS gear on the AH, and excess ores/bars from mining.
---
I was getting about 5-15G/day the last couple days and bought my mount 1 bar into 36.
---
You can also try selling faction exclusive pets on the cross faction AH, but don't expect them to sell for more than 2, maybe 3 for popular ones. And def don't go hard on them, I wouldn't put up more than 2/day if they're selling. You kill your profit real fast listing them.
---
He can farm wherever the fuck he wants. The salt from people in this thread crying about efficiency is lol. He's paying money to play this game however he wants, not how you want him to.
---
ITT Envious people, and defensive Warriors.
---
Yeah, or logged his friend account
---
I sometimes just like strafe+backpeddle the tower, or I do hard turns instead of smooth one's, those towers will always be a pain, I've come to terms with them over the years, but it's also the reason I believe they got removed in Cata
---
I believe if you use a /cast SPELL without a (rank x) it casts the highest
---
RemindMe! 20 hours
---
I saw hoj drop last week
---
No war and no rog in group
---
Now our feral druid has one lol
---
Dude bring anyone 55+. Any dps is better than no dps. I even had a few sub 55 players the first week. They cleared through brd to zone in through the portal. No attunement required that way. Just clear everything. Don’t try to skip any trash.
---
Played since launch in short spurts almost every day and im lvl 44, would suck to be bored of the game already :P
---
Hey :)
---
I tend to have the same reaction as this guy when I see some Lvl 60 completely annihilate my exp grind spot, just so he can get 15g/hr like an absolut fucking donkey. Only that I do not whisper them and keep that thought to myself.
---
Skinning LW. I just came from there and it was decent to farm, just didn't know if they were giving good exp.
---
Why the hell did the community think that keeping a mechanic meant for equalizing people playing on 200 ping and 20 FPS is worth keeping when in 2019 people have on average 40 ping and anywhere from 60 to over 200 FPS just for niche PvP cases that is really just abuse of this system.
---
Awesome, me and my s/o are doing the same, currently level 50, I played hardcore in vanilla-wrath, she never touched a mmo until classic, hoping to be doing the same in the next week.
---
lots of grinds combined.
---
Lost 3 dalrends so far, 3 blackcrows and done 15+ runs of lbrs for the quartermaster belt without it dropping. Tons of hoj runs ofc too, at this point I'm just gonna wait out and get raid gear replacements and eventually grind out hoj as 2 rogues.
---
Maybe I can make it work then!
---
Is their any addon that Shows enemy Buffs below the Target Window like in Retail  ? 
---
Or any addon at all for enemy buffs ?
---
Sorry I offended you
---
&gt; I was getting about 5-15G/day the last couple days and bought my mount 1 bar into 36.
---
I didn't think you could buy it before 40?
---
You are a spec that specializes in your dmg output. Your pet can barely hold threat over you to begin with. If you haven't got your pets skills upgraded it will make it even harder. Try spacing out your actions.
---
He pays to play however he wants get off your high horse just because he doesn't play the way you want.
---
It is.
---
Yeah, you understand what I was trying to say. The problem is we are actually using the definition of the word. People just think "casual" means something different when applied to this game. People will get upset and argue if you tell them to go learn what the word means. People get insulted when you insinuate they don't know something. I honestly don't know how to explain the word has a definition and they are adding their own connotation to it.
---
if you're a warrior like your flair, don't buy more thank rank 1 of all the skills you don't need meaningless flat damage for
---
155FR and as much HP as you can get. +defense does nothing.
---
When are we going to get BGs?
---
Fuckin story of my lite
---
TIL I shouldn't be levelling mining as a hunter
---
i learned that i was unimaginably lucky to get executioner's cleaver, blackstone ring, HOJ, and blackhand's breadth without farming for them. i mean i knew they were good, but i didn't know how good, or how coveted they all were.
---
Reminds me when i was like 5 or 6 years old, was really turbotarted and me with friends of same age were collecting rocks (some of which were pretty cool) and then playing something like bakugan/pokemon type of game with a rock like a bunch of retards. WE LEGIT MADE UP A LORE, ROCK TYPES/RARITIES, AND COMBOS OUT OF FUCKING ROCKS. Looking back at that time there were even incidents where there was trading/selling function which allowed to trade your “fumot type rock” (yes there different types of rocks, probably like 7 or more) for a “kimur type rock”. I don’t know how in any known literature fuck is this related to WoW, and neither what you should do with this information.
---
Shoot, you're right. What server are you on? I'll make a character and do all the market research and price analysis of all the different fish and get back to you. Or maybe just dont be snide and contrarian to people on the internet who are trying to help.
---
Still a great read though
---
He won’t hear the end of this as a gm lol. Scrutiny points upwards after all.
---
that's something bro.
---
Dont do drugs kids
---
I get your point but I’d rather just farm the trade mats I need rather than buy them off of AH. Feels more rewarding. And ”the best g/h farming spot” is not any given place, prices especially at this point of the game fluctuate a lot
---
My guild is starting up our 5th group this week.
---
This hurts.
---
A mage in my guild got two back to back. Second one went on a greed roll. :'(
---
Sigh.... this entire chain of comments is underneath a reply I sent to you. That reply was a What If scenario. ALL comments underneath my What If scenario are thus going to be set in that scenario until someone else proposes different what if scenario. That means that is the exact scenario your expecting the OP to tank in.
---
Try to debate when you actually know how.
---
&gt;This is Going to be Hard
---
Spoiler: it's not hard at all. It's not even an elite.
---
Level 39 here, about on 250 with Tailoring and 300 with cooking, just started with fishing.
---
Having a great time.
---
Sitting only on 10g, but that mount will come sooner or maybe later..
---
Animated chain necklace. 40 runs in and have yet to see it drop.
---
Does he want $15 an hour?!?!
---
&gt; Right now you’re probably better off just vendoring most matts
---
This has been my experience, yes.

What's the drop %?
---
That's for retail, not classic.
---
You described my opener right there. Hell, I often have a 2H equipped during this to increase the burst from the whirlwind. It's more threat than the thunderclap opener described above, with or without a 2H, but it does spike your damage intake right on the pull. Honestly hasn't been a big concern as long as the healers watch for it.
---
Rank never mattered.  It was just fun to have area wide kill zones - that shit was fun.

Had it stuck in my head for so long now haha

It sounds so sad and typecast, but it is ultimately true, Classic is bringing back the feel and community that there was before. 
---
Every time I see a post like this I’m that much closer to signing up and starting again!!
---
Interesting, what server and guild?
---
Think of those staff of dominance bop combos!! What a way to clap somebody!!
---
No, you can't see enemy buffs in classic without the mage using 'detect magic'
---
I call it skill based drinking
---
I'm just not even willing to go through that. Maybe that means I won't be raiding, so be it.
---
Says the millennial who is literally nothing of substance.
---
Is it normal that I hate STV for how crowded it is?
---
Literally every mob is constantly being killed the second it respawns.  Every time I take a quest there I cringe a little. Or is it not a usual state of Stragnlethorn?
---
hey maybe don't use slurs please
---
I have, and I have played Dota 2 also
---
i do this but i just used browser netflix and DeskPins. but this is wayyyyy better hahah. im over here using stone tools and youre zeep zappin in the future. TY foir the info!
---
The rage is real. Can almost imagine his keyboard covered in his own anger spit!
---
What do you mean? It was possible in vanilla.
---
There are a few hidden emotes in the game that you cant find details about on any of the official wow websites. these include /golfclap where your character slow claps, /doom where your character dooms everyone around to death. 
---
Just a silly thing but amusing none the less.
---
Wrong. Don’t unlock chest unless you get what’s inside. The group wouldn’t have access to the loot without someone to open it.
---
/y AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
/ROLL
---
I don't think refer a friend was in the game until wotllk?
---
He won't get away!
---
laughs in hunter!
---
is what i would say if i played one, but im a warrior...
---
You can't parry or block an attack from behind, and you need a shield equipped to block in the first place. Also, weapon skill has virtually no bearing in pvp as far as I'm aware, since I don't believe glancing blows are a thing against players. 
---
Both these combine to make pvp a much different beast than pve.
---
It's a controversial subject, so take my macros with a grain of salt.

This does the same thing, but instead of a mouse modifier it detects if you are or aren't in combat. The reason I prefer the former is that I have it keybound to mouse scroll up, and if I use the latter it switches me to berserker stance when I don't want it to.

Right now it's getting the [Mature Blue Dragon Sinew](https://www.classicdb.ch/?item=18704) as the last part of my Rhok Delar quest. It has a drop rate under 1%, so I've been stuck here in Winterspring for 3 days waiting for it to drop. I just want to do anything else ingame at this point.
---
Awesome!
---
Printscreen works too :p
---
Oh hell yeah combat beats out sub for DPS, but I just find it more fun personally dagger and sword with a macro to switch. My only issue is whether knowing rupture with the 30% boost from the talent and garrote or if ambush and eviscerate are faster for kills with remorseless to guarentee a crit
---
but, what worms are we talking about? Grubthor?
---
I just spelled it out for you moron
---
So... you could say... it rocks?
---
Yeah, that'll work exactly as they want it to.
---
Worked for me well today, managed to roll 95 on Vis'kag the Bloodletter and win the roll against like 8 other rogues
---
Tauren. In addition to being the OG tank from the strategy games, they are big, strong walls of muscle and they even have mechanics that reinforce the awesome tanking 
---
Your big. You can hit things from further away than others - they think they're out of range but NOPE! Big Bull arms can still catch them.
---
Losing aggro or being threatened by a bunch of fools casting close to you. STOMP! They're not going anywhere or doing anything
---
Also, they look good whether their armor is big and bulky, or straps that show off those massive muscles.
---
I corpse camp all undead characters because I like to pick on virgins
---
Idk what but I keep hearing it drops from 3 diff bosses. Got hoj off of general, but my atlas said it was from emp. It also said force of will is off general. I updated my atlas and it switched to emp for force of will and general for hoj...
---
In so confused!
---
Hey Right back at you. You don’t care about a rogue lockpicking skill until it benefits you. 
---
Nice attitude you got there.
---
You have to stop using 20 sided dice.
---
100% true. Last couple of levels becomes so hard, then upgrade and you can’t steal aggro off him, let alone lose it with normal rotations!
---
People get so upset about reserving drops but it’s so necessary with the time investment and drop rates of these items
---
Oof. Maybe I’ll stick with my priest then. Thanks for the reply!
---
Watch out dude. They will be IP tracking you as we speak and deploying a squad of navy seals trained in gorilla warfare to teach to take WoW seriously.
---
Keep feeding her crack!!!!
---
Are you the mother fuckers with "bankruptcy" as a member? Bc I hate that cloth selling bastard.
---
Edit: after rereading, I realized you said, "razorgore". I'm on rattlegore. My bad
---
The “post to reddit” ruins it imo.
---
I was because my atlas said it was from him until I updated it... then i got HOJ from him and my atlas currently said force of will is from emp. Help!!!’ Lol
---
They do it to piss you off, not to perform.
---
Semi-roleplay/head canon a truly good forsaken (like the argent dawn ones) and you will feel like your character is a goddamn saint everytime you have a priest healer (due to forsaken feeling excruciating pain if Holy/light spells are used on them).
---
Class* 
---
But as a hunter- Ay fuck you!
---
obviously you would not take mining for copper bars, but for iron, mithril and later on thorium..  Oh and arcane crystals are 30g on most servers...  a nice long term prospective
---
Ok champ
---
Because they are filthy alliance obviously.
---
He has the right to "play the way he wants" and I have the right to call him selfish for it
---
Any good pvp eastern servers with a more or less good balance between Alliance/Horde?
---
Very true, but I never look at reddit from my computer so I’d never have posted it using print screen.
---
Stockades is the easiest opportunity, but has bad loot.
---
SFK, difficult to reach for alliance, but great loot table
---
BFD, decent loot table, but also less of a hassle to reach
---
Fury spec has much better rage generation than arms in situations where you have no aggro.
---
that's crazy to me. that's like a 20 year old now without a cell phone. i grew up the poorest of the poor and still had ready access to a number of households with game consoles. they were kindof a big deal.
---
you're\*
---
The whole, "Tank or Leave" thing is the very definition of expecting someone to Tank. Your contradicting yourself so hard.
---
Yup
---
Just never touch the AH for gear and skip out on detect lesser demons rank 7 and you should be fine
---
That is true with the right team you can do any of the content but I don't think that's what meant. 
---
Later on guilds are going to be alot more selective about specs because the raids get alot harder. If you think it's bad now it's going to get way worse.
---
Exactly.  You've been spoiled by games showing you the way.  Instant gratification generation.  
---
Back when wow came out, this was not a thing.  It was designed for us to read and explore, even at a snail's pace.  It gave us time to learn and fall in love with the game.  If you take a new player who is not only new to WoW, but new to games in general.. and force an addon like Questie on them.. you are essentially robbing them of that experience, and chances are they will never learn to love the game as much as they would had they been given the chance (and time) to build those memories.
---
Pretty much anyone can join a pug on the weekend and clear most of MC in a few hours. Onyxia is normally done with 20-25 people, even in pugs.
---
Back then it was much much harder to even see the inside of those raid dungeons, let alone down Ragnoros after months of wiping through MC.
---
Raiding is much much more accessible.
---
BWL will be pugged too (although to a lesser degree). Only after that the raids will become less accessible.
---
no server is dying, your 26...the bulk of people are 40-60 by now.
---
perhaps join a more active guild
---
Wrong af. Pots are magic buff and dispellable (eaten by felhunter etc).
---
I used to be very good at that, if you gave me 20g starting cash, I would have 100 a week later.  but these days everybody and their mom seems to be using advanced AH addons that pick up anything that is undervalued  and I find it very hard to spot good deals, compared to a few years ago
---
What joke?
---
How do you get extra action bars? 
---
I know there is the 5 standard. But this guy has like 8
---
Loot rules should be decided upon forming the group. Most people just deem it acceptable BoE blue or epic is everyone need.
---
Its the safest way to ensure nobody gets fucked over.
---
Yeah, that is waaayyyyyy different levels. He should have a bottle for every shot they do and it still wouldn't be equal!
---
wow ^^
---
it got cut off but after that he actually said "i was just kidding about the reddit thing but i wouldnt mind if you do"
---
Alt +print for only your active window..
---
Ya taking an alliance guild to a horde Zerg server as horde...
---
They used expert goldminer's helmet and rogue spec to test +weaponskill. The only thing that matters is level difference for glancing.
---
Youre like druids who dont get water form until 60
---
Youre not a real warlock.
---
&gt; PvP - no
---
That entirely depends. Are you doing it to kill people? Then, yeah, no.
---
But if you're pvp healing, you want sword and board, no question about it. Shields have obnoxiously high armor for the slot, and so you become effectively immune to all physical damage as a healadin with sword'n'board.
---
laughs in shaaman
---
is what i would say if i played one, but im a priest
---
MOBA’s piss you off for one match. WoW can ruin your day.
---
I hope I see you in game soon. You seem like you’re 1 or 2 ganks away from quitting. Not that I want you to (I’d prefer you just realize it’s an intentional part of the game by the developers and learn to like it or love it), but I’d like to be the one that finally makes you rage quit. 
---
There’s more honor in that than an HK.
---
I also feel like everyone should need on all boe’s in a pug. Ninja problem solved
---
YOU GOT MALOWNED
---
Unless stated otherwise in the beginning of the run, everyone can loot as they see fit. 
---
So basically, sucks to suck
---
Don't get it
---
Savage gladiator chain.
---
I always did the run with 1 mage and 1 priest and now all the mages and priests on my server got their loot and i gotta wait for new ones to get 60 to get them their gear
---
It will proc for your Druid buddy though. So not a complete waste.
---
&gt; we never saw a Bulwark
---
Is that that spikey barn door? God that thing looked badass.
---
Nah
---
This was true in 2004-2005
---
We run like 2 rogues in a 35-40 man raid on PVP server
---
Everyone knows better now and they all went warrior or mage instead this time around
---
Lets be honest, if the dude is taking pictures of his screen do you REALLY think he had 7 stacks of Swifthistle? No.
---
This guy will be posting ‘how to farm mount gold?’ in a month and we both know it.
---
I need to go lie down after that one.
---
You can do that too, just keep in mind it's probably a net loss in gold.
---
Yeah, you're right, I wasn't disagreeing. I just see that fact thrown around a lot and it tends to discourage people leveling for the first time. 45-60 is so much fun!
---
Way to make sure you won't be taken seriously around here anymore
---
Friend bought his from the AH for 175g
---
Thanks!  
---
It's actually in the YouTube comment section but here you go:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/41005030024-5032001-05501310231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/41005030024-5032001-05501310231)

U mad? poor lil alliance baby didn't get any rest so he's cranky
---
&gt;If your only arguement is stereotyping it has no teeth. Come back when you think of anything creative
---
Your comeback was such a failure I dont even need to think of a new response
---
and here my guild can't even clear BRD D:
---
For dps or tanking brother ?
---
fuck off
---
Yeah, Atlas was off due to phasing itemization. Later down the line, phase 5 I believe? It'll be swapped, HoJ will drop from Emp and FoW from Angerforge, but for right now, it's the other way around.
---
Herbs bro
---
Herbs or mining
---
Or
---
Herbs *and* mining
---
Or fishing
---
You picked a gold sink and a terrible goldmaking gathering profession. DPS classes can get away with this but you shouldn't, hence your dilemma
---
Yes. It's absurd that mages don't charge considering you save people so much money on food/water. And it's shitty to not tip a little bit when you've just been saved 2-5g
---
+16
---
Assistant to the Regional Manager
---
Yep, though I’ve been having trouble giving water away lately!  I try to buff everyone I see while out questing and ask if they’d like some food/water.  It just makes me feel good knowing I’m making their grind a bit easier.  And, yes unfortunately, I think I’m also trying to counteract the new rep our class has acquired.
---
1 or 8. No in-between.
---
Hardly.
---
By your logic, Hunters and Warlocks also shouldn't ever be out in the open world farming because they should be selling Princess runs for gold because that's faster than farming it out in the open world.
---
Is there a good guild or particular wow classic server I could join? I haven't played since mists of pandaria and wanted to get back into vanilla wow.
---
i've actually had the opposite experience, most mages i've pugged with were fine with handing out water, even food when i asked politely.
---
there's only been a handful of asshats who refuse to make water. but i just boot em out of the group and move on.
---
They do that's the point.
---
I thought it was cool, people on this sub will bitch about literally anything
---
Literally unplayable dog shit ass game
---
[part 2](https://imgur.com/a/JQZvKcT)
---
Then that guy is talking out of his arse.
---
wat
---
Just started doing Badlands quests earlier today, and it's damn near impossible to even tag mobs during peak hours.
---
Slam warriors don't top any meters, and the same warrior would just do better with bonereavers edge, and be more useful to the raid with nightfall. Coming from a warrior who would love this wep, there's just no way to justify fairly giving this weapon to a warrior
---
Then you leave if theyre being a dick for the sake of being one
---
&gt;I have no idea how to make 85 gold in four days. 
---
Well, you will make more from 36-40 than from 20 to 35...  so that is one. You should be getting quest rewards worth 70s-1g10..   grey and green items that vendor for 50s, 1g if its a 2 handed weapon....  everything gets better (except training fees , those also go towards &gt;1g)  But just SKIP all training that you don't need for tanking or leveling .
---
And as a last resort you can always spend 1-2 levels grinding the best cash mobs.   at your lvl it would take about 400 kills for 60g.  (les if you get a lucky rare or epic)
---
I laughed out load for a long time. Where is this from?!

---
Prolly doesn't dismiss his pet in gnomer too
---
Your choices are pretty much dependent on how you want to play the game, will you be okay with taking time off to fish or would you prefer to just keep your nose to the grindstone?
---
If you're okay with taking the time off to fish, then learn the recipe and sell the dish. While the food will probably sell for less on the Horde AHs than on the Alliance ones, you should still be able to net far more gold over time through making and selling the food than through selling the recipe. 
---
Make sure to check the neutral AH and try to sell there, as well, because Alliance has a much harder time getting the food, and lots of people like using it.
---
If you'd rather just keep leveling, though, and don't want to spend time gathering for money, then sell the recipe and take what you can get for it.
---
Lol crazy how that happens. Hopin for an eye this week. The leaf can’t drop 5 times in a row right? Right!?
---
made it to 40 today, still only 48g .. i assume mount at 45-50 somewhere. still having fun, but friends stopped playing
---
[part 3](https://imgur.com/a/iSbFB6y)
---
Basically, I need to stop Ambushing and work on my StunLock (get it??). Makes sense!
---
So here’s my take on it. You should play whatever the hell you want. However, just like you, people are entitled to their own opinion. DPS are a dime a dozen, it’s so easy to dodge a warrior DPS and pick up a mage or warlock who will put out much more than you will. 
---
IMO, you should just tank. Instant groups, you call all the shots and no one will kick you for needing on DPS gear. Because let’s face it, no one kicks a tank. If I could
---
Tank as the class I was playing just in my
---
Normal DPS spec, I would definitely do it. Tanking in vanilla isn’t some crazy complicated thing. Just my 2 cents.
---
i'll tell you a secret from a guy who tanked every expansion
---
Most of hates comes from people who never play/try tanking..
---
 Holding aggro in vanilla is a team work dps should wait few sec never go full in and take threats don't aoe mobs like an idiot and such,if dps does that and instead they throw the blame on you kick this douchbag or leave the group and watch them struggle and waste an hour looking for a replacement
---
if you actually on the wrong than take it and learn from it..
---
Every tank faced the same thing one point in their lifes a guy under me called feltire ignore that douchbag he never tanked before,a rogue dps who get carried by others..
---
So good luck man and with your tanking ignore douchbags and enjoy wow !
---
I noticed this when half the people in the guild im in are warrior's.
---
Shut up pussy
---
They go for 6s on my server right now and the elementals are *still* farmed to hell and back.
---
Well at least 10h are proba my walking/flying around.
---
I'm actually curious if something like an actual functioning bank ever formed in wow. Would be cool to take loans for your mounts and pay them back later, and if you cant pay the interest, get your ass ganked by loan sharks.
---
I’ve got a 32 hunter, 22 priest, 20 Druid, 19 warrior, 14 rogue and 6 pally. I’m trying to get them spaced out by like 5 levels/ but instance range.
---
I didn't even know about this item until I did that quest and thought, hey this is cool, what if I just keep the item instead of doing the quest? Turns out it's a pretty well known thing.
---
Though I had someone ask me how I got exalted with timbermaw so fast. At level 40.
---
Yup I want crazy about herbalism and alchemy. Idek how many hours have been just running in ghost wolf to gather herbs.
---
Taking a BiS for something you will absolutely throw away makes you a wanker and a shitty gamer
---
[Instead of being useless, maybe contribute instead of just bitching?](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294595/classic-wow-raid-reset-days-and-schedule)
---
You're right, it resets on Wednesdays in EU. But your passive-aggressive comment does nothing to help anyone.
---
that's the one time I'd give them a pass for demanding to be paid because the mage portal requires a mat but the lock portal just uses up a soul stone, but its funny how they all want me to burn mana and a stone to summon them but then some of them bitch when being asked to burn their own mana for buffs and drinks
---
Yeah. I see absolutely nothing wrong with reserving drops. Like you said, losing dozens, maybe more hours of work on a shitty roll is just not an option.
---
I'm debating even keeping the combo. Seems like I'll be losing out on gold and not really gaining it. Maybe with tailoring I'll get to make bags and gear but ench just seems like a money sink.

---
Yeah wait until these people hit 60 lol. After being 60 for a bit I'm pretty bored, and I'm not inclined to level up another character.
---
It's still fun, and I'm going to come back for every phase, but for the foreseeable future I'm raid logging. I will admit that I miss the mechanical complexity of endgame content on retail.
---
One guild getting two isn't fishy. Every guild getting two would be fishy.
---
I almost went war but assumed every guild and server would be ludicrously stacked
---
So I went mage instead lol
---
I figure if I go with a super OP class I might as well be free to port and peddle conjured water between losing gear rolls to the other 15 men in dresses
---
I usually play Troll but I’m a female undead priest. I feel like male undead are worse though.
---
not always practical on PVP servers, but great tip
---
Oh hi 😂 I was just bewildered about the /yell from that point on
---
we call it the casual olympics
---
It only lists 'World of Warcraft' as an only option. No classic anywhere. =/
---
I mean. It's an 18s reagent. They charge 5x the price of the reagent lol
---
but it has to take at least 3 full episodes or you'll miss your kamehameha
---
I feel ya. It's so frustrating to find groups sometimes. Especially when the mage gets his belt from Ogre within a few runs and just leaves after that.
---
I'm curious, how many kills do you have on Gorosh? I have 6 but I've had no luck yet.
---
I saw the image originally on the pew pew channel FB page. I added the meme mustard and purple haze.
---
You should always tip mages at least a gold for a portal, unless your a super new player. The reagent cost 18s, 1g barely makes it worth their time IMO.
---
There's no verification process though, we all know you're a mage in disguise.
---
You need loot rules to be stated BEFORE you start the run. If you don’t, well... it’s every man for themselves.
---
I dont converse with rapists and Nazis.
---
Dont you see how dumb it sounds to jump to absurd conclusions
---
I just got my lvl 40 mount and I consider myself pretty casual
---
Love this idea, great stuff!! Need everyone to track deaths, time and bathroom visits to compare!!
---
yeah i'm 0/5/46 as well lol. its so bad for anything outside dungeons haha
---
Was thinking of 21/0/30 but I feel like it will hinder the heals to much. 
---
I feel your pain boo
---
Don't really care what you do. That doesn't make it the normal. I would straight up kick any schmuck who did this in game.
---
&gt; “Jack of all trades, master of none” is a quote for a reason. 
---
That is the shortened version.  The origianl was "Jack of all trades, Master of none.  Oftentimes better than a master of one."
---
Been searching for about 30min now without any success. Its strange that no one has done an addon like this, since almost every UI package has it somehow.
---
Right now I use stoneslayer, 51 orc. What weapon should I try to get next as my solo leveling is not the smoothest?
---
So theoretically if i hit hit cap i dont need them? 
---
Im looking at a build that excludes them if possible
---
Have you seen the movie Bright? It's a modern spin on magic world. There are super rich elves with machine guns.
---
One way to know for sure would be if the World, global, and LookingForGroup chat channels are silent. If you haven’t done so, I would /join those channels.
---
Thanks! I have it too... but I dont have that :( Maybe its some specific config? Or is the default?
---
That's not dumb at all
---
That you do.
---
And here I was thinking I was original

Are there 12 paladins/warlocks in the raid or mages are just too cheap to craft archmage?
---
Yep, it's why I rolled a warrior. Spent too many hours waiting for a group back in the day, didn't want to deal with it again.
---
My friend: "I can send food to your warrior."  
---
Me: "I don't eat food as a warrior. You know why? Because I die every 5 minutes."
---
At least for me I despise any instanced farming for gold/resources to the point I wish the game would not allow you to be in an instance alone. I’d much rather go farm something in the open world where there are opportunities for wpvp. I play this game mainly for pvp and if I can farm something while also getting to enjoy pvp I’ll do it.
---
If you're just going for 20 don't worry about the fire totem mission honestly, it'll take a while and you'll be better off just questing in the barrens
---
Not as lame as gatekeeping.
---
Yes you're an asshole for rolling a tank and thinking you're a DPS.
---
Idea was to be DPS :P and the LW was to help the friends out. 
---
sadly our priest decided to stay shadow, so I stepped up to go resto. 
---
I might consider dropping LW for Herb but who knows. 
---
Got a mage to 17 haha. gonna farm for me
---
Ironman btw
---
Mob info
---
25 here. I’m enjoying running around as a priest and just helping people. 
---
I’ve saved plenty of people about to die from a group of mobs. They are probably thinking *oh great here comes a graveyard run* and suddenly a Flash Heal saves them. 
---
That is a good feeling to just help out. 
---
I give everyone I can extra stamina before mana runs out. 
---
Classic is great.
---
If I see one dude yelling before rolls I'll either leave my group or kick that person. This is nonsense. And I'm afraid some people actually starting to think this might be legit. 2 month from now you see people just spamming A for no reason at all. The shortest jokes are always the best...yes like my penis, thank you.
---
Download it from the website I linked and drag both folders from inside the zip file to your addon folder inside  WoW classic installation location.
---
This one is only downloadable from their website, they provide an update notification in game when one is available.
---
There is a reason why Hand of Ragnaros was given quite regularly to shamans and palas ... both which do not have a build that makes use of it in PvE.
---
Or they’re just trying to get the essences for enchants and stuff you fucking donkey?
---
There is literally not a single person on earth whom this is easier for, than taking a screenshot. One touch of a button on a keyboard you already have your hand(s) on.
---
Shockadin is a poor pvp build.  Ret pally deals 30% less dps than other classes.  You have to try harder for less.  If that sounds good, then try it out.  And please dont go shockadin.  Its only use is healing or a small burst of dmg when moving.  Not worth that many holy pts for a situational skill.
---
One match of WoW? No such thing unless you are doing BG’s which aren’t in classic. So no you cannot.
---
Your Opinion is the minority, this thread has popped up 100's of times of the last month I'm just giving the generic response. Only got to look at the recent epic boe drop streamer drama to realise this is how it should be.
---
Just use the search tool "schmuck"
---
Warhammer references in my classicwow? Yes please
---
And as a fan of both, btw, Orktober is non stop
---
I'm a level 32 Horde priest and I was hating life at level 30 because all the quests seemed to be either level 26 or level 33, but then I realized I was in the level range for Scarlet Monastery and then I got two levels in a day :)
---
COO... 7
---
I quested as a Druid as balance and I’m mid 50s now so I didn’t need multiple sets because balance and resto are nearly the same. It requires a little bit more preparedness in water and food but it’s not impossible to go relatively quickly.
---
Your best bet is definitely priest though from your post. I’d probably rank it like Priest&gt;Paladin&gt;Shaman&gt;Druid. This is me assuming you’d be enhance as shaman from 10-35 until you decide to switch Ele/resto whenever that is. Paladins quest fairly competently with holy shock and Righteous Seal. Druid would require multiple sets if you wanted to min/max leveling in feral and then respeccing later in the game to resto.

Setting loot rules helps prevent ninja looting and if someone does ninja you can report them and they'll get the item removed and a temp ban for breaking the agreed rules

Welcome to Shadowrun

Grats:). Getting mine soon too
---
Nothing good has ever come out of Silithus.
---
well what gives you the right to use addons? you played the game before? fuck you buddy don't reply to me.
---
I understand why, but I play the game for fun. I don't care if someone else is making slightly less money than they could be. They can play a mage too or they can go somewhere else
---
RemindMe! 10 hours
---
I never joined a Corp there but was so lucky long time ago I found a dip worth many millions and bought an abaddon (such a cool ship)
---
Curious why you have a couple of the same classes? Not trying to hate, just trying different races?
---
Oh, I didn't even think about that.  I just started with arms and then when to fury once I got the 20 points into it like the guide showed.  Thanks for opening my eyes up on my mistake!
---
Decimation, indeed!
---
I always thought most Bank Alts want their own Guild to stash stuff no ?
---
All this "new meta" is doing is taking the little difficulty there was in DPSing, multiplying it, and moving it onto the tank and the healer.

Thought i would start in classic to get a sense of what everyone else got to try in 2005. I honestly didn't think it would be this much fun, i doubted i would go more than 2 weeks. And yet here i am with an epic mount, and still have not lost the thirst for classic. Can't wait for the next phases! 
---
P.S. (Semi repost since old post got deleted since i forgot to put a flair)
---
I’ve added killing those 2 patrolling fireguards into my route, elemental fire is about 3g on my server so it may be worth the extra time
---
Pretty impressive you made a strawman argument but the strawman argument was also retarded
---
Just curious, why would mages have to grind? Or is it because grinding is easier for them so they choose to do it instead of questing?
---
Imagine playing WoW classic over Artifact SMH and start streaming again you loser.
---
Those encrypted texts are a great way to farm gold.
---
 and I'm not robbed because my irl friend who introduced me to the game would be dragging me around nevertheless.  this game is too large to get everything out of it,  i don't have my whole life to play. get off of your high horse.
---
I don’t think there is one. I have played wow on and off since release and have always bounced around with never truly having a main. 
---
Currently in classic I have 40 Mage, 33 Hunter, 32 Hunter, 30 Mage (changes servers) 15 warlock and looking at a Druid to start. 
---
Ive come the realisation it does not really matter if I don’t. Eventually I’ll get to 60 maybe. Just enjoy the now and who cares about later ?
---
We just wanna fish bro
---
You sound like a good player then. I play a priest and it is tiring how every lock and melee forgets that food exist when they party up.
---
It's going well but I quickly get "you have entered too many instances recently". Is it only a few per hour I can do this?
---
"hidden"
---
Guys, I'm a level 31 rogue (Alliance) on the Sulfuras server. I was wondering if there was a guild out there who are active on discord and are accepting new players. I'm on everyday and want to join an active guild.
---
Especially since mages can make in the realms of 50g/h inside a dungeon, which means they don't need to deal with PvP or loot competition, but instead they take a 20g/h spot from other classes who would have absolutely no chance in the dungeon.
---
Earthfurry
---
I’ve been playing this game since vanilla and recently did darkshore instead of westfall for the first time... holy shit it’s faster leveling for sure
---
If it’s a valuable drop worth more than 2-300g everyone should roll need on it
---
Flairs mean nothing, that's mage mentality
---
Make a rank called Stack Manager. Then he would be Fishstack the Stack Manager of the State Bank of Azeroth.
---
You can't get riding training before 40, but you can buy the mounts themselves.
---
It's 2019, you can't be using that derogatory term.
---
Stop.
---
Why would you want to turn the camera with the keyboard? What benefit does that give?
---
But what's your opinion on Warlords (especially Battlecry)?
---
I farmed my truefaith mats in vanilla. I spent hours swimming around opening clams for pearls worth a couple gold each.
---
I got 10 with in 2 hours of farming them, ymmv
---
I just killed some satyrs while waiting on respawns.
---
In my experience, water &amp; air have a high drop rate relative to earth &amp; fire.
---
I bet when you tried to reply you were already ignored! I meet players like this all the time.
---
It wasn’t me. My friend from my guild send me this on snapchat!
---
no, if it was that good you would have bought it yourself.
---
Every person I've run into thinks otherwise. Reddit is a minority, and the vast majority don't give two shits what happens to streamers.
---
[Kkthnx](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25333-KkthnxUI_Classic.html) is pretty nice, been using it in Legion and there's version for Classic now.
---
Paladin is worse than Druid. You need strength gear for solo/questing &amp; intellect for dungeons/raids. With intellect mail &amp; plate being scarce you end up wearing cloth &amp; leather for your intellect set.
---
So it begins, and it’s glorious!
---
SL locks unite
---
Needing BoE blues is definitely the norm. More valuable to sell for mount money than to actually use for a limited time just to replace in 5 or 10 levels. Most of the time I tell my group all need, but I usually wait until everyone has chosen their selected roll before i commit to need or greed ensuring I don’t get fucked by some trickster.
---
The mages are bad circle jerk in the sub is getting worse every day.
---
You can do this with Weak Auras pretty easily.  Wago.io likely has a string that you can import to do it, but this one is very easy to create yourself.
---
Come to Earthfury. Its a balanced server with no streamers:)
---
I mean I've played this game for like 15 years and I could probably count the number of times randoms have shit on me for no reason on one hand. I barely see anyone else get shit on either. If you're getting shit on in every group you join it's you.
---
Greed = sell. It's that simple.
---
I was ignored way before this point, he just kept messaging me while I was on ignore. This was the last thing he said.
---
If it’s BiS it’s 100% more important than gold, not sure how you don’t understand that.
---
thats the one I am using that sometimes leaves me in caster form
---
Question- Has anyone (hunter) tried stacking +healing gear yet? Does it work on mend-pet at the moment? Was going to mess around and make a mend-pet farming build for lulz.
---
You can do 5 runs and it starts the moment you enter your first one. If you want you can try the chests in SM Lib too, but they’re higher lv mobs obv. Be sure to check the courtyard spawns and there might be a rare boss spawn. I kinda took my time, watched tv and stuff being distracted lol, and never got locked out. I’d say each run took me like 10 minutes at least.
---
How did they not get alcohol poisoning? Seriously
---
Bruh you posted on a public forum, obviously people are going to discuss whatever you posted
---
Unless you see the pattern on the AH after some one needs your a cuck if you drag there name around
---
UBRS Jed/Rend runs to get the mainhand dal Rends.
---
I saw 2 in my first 20 or so runs when I started and lost both rolls, once to a tie to rub salt in the wound. Since then I’ve been organizing Jed/Rend 5-6 man groups every time I log on. In the past week I’ve done 40 runs and haven’t seen a single mainhand drop. 
---
It’s one thing to lose a roll, but it’s another to not even see the damn thing. I am so sick of ubrs but it’s the last piece I need while I wait for the rest of my guild to be ready to start raiding.
---
Mage main to level 35. Level 36 training is going to suck, but even without AHing things, I'm sitting around 8g. Alts are just about topped up on rested XP, so next week I'll probably play them all up to level 12 or 13.
---
The AH for lowbie trade mats on Mankrik is trash. I'm actually going to be able to afford to buy mats to level my crafting alts. I should probably also start buying and stockpiling cloth for when I powerlevel Tailoring to 300 at 60.
---
Meanwhile, I’m on week 3, and still zero prophecy, transcendence, nor eye of divinity drops.
---
It's very much normal in every group and server I have ever played on.
---
Damage over time effects on you may break your stealth!
---
Kirtonos is balanced, much more than the polls I've seen. It's competitive
---
People like you are why retail is so garbage
---
Respec to BM. Use a cat or an owl while leveling. Your rotation is hunters mark, send in pet, auto shot, SS, auto shot, multi shot.
---
yes. some places you need 300+ to fish, Bay of Storms you need good rod + 100 fishing bobber and you will still miss some fish
---
The greed icon is literally a coin. That is done to convey meaning. I don't understand why people think it means anything else by default.
---
It depends on the group and the player whether healer has enough mana. Some Warlocks will life tap all the way to low health, then proceed to play badly and pull lots of aggro, so they are life tapping aggressively \*and\* taking lots of damage, so you constantly have to heal them.
---
"You have more than enough mana to heal" is not an excuse for playing badly as a DPS, and as a tip: when the group is playing well, the healer wastes less mana, and you can move through the dungeon faster because there's less downtime.
---
That’s just ridiculous. Hand of rag proves access to end game content, period.  That’s what hardcore players are looking for: Any guild organized enough to farm endgame content early on, gear everyone up fast with minimal drama and solid results. 
---
Any other variation of that and you’re talking about such a crazy small niche group of ultra-optimizers in the 0.001% that its not even worth a conversation because it’s out of the realm of normal hardcore.
---
But it's BUYABLE. You can BUY that BIS. The pattern itself is literally just a gold drop.
---
Are you serious?
---
How fucking entitled do you have to be to expect that every group you ever apply to much oblige to the wishes of being dps and not even have the option of saying no to that.
---
You are delusional man, thanks for perfectly fitting the stereotype of the asshole mage that I have seen countless times in classic
---
Ayy fellow guildies! I love the concept that everyone can ginvite, so everytime I see another banker, I can let hin join out pack. Kind regard Nootbank
---
As someone who also needs the mainhand, I am not looking forward to this grind.
---
Not everyone is a PvE tailoring tard homie
---
Literally just do your dps rotation and you will be fine.  You know that your DPS can tank trash right?  It’s okay if not all the mobs are attacking you, if it’s an AOE pull or something.  Even clothies don’t die that fast.  As long as you charge in and get the first few hits on you to build up rage, WW Sweeping Strikes and normal dps rotation will hold aggro on trash no problem.  You only need to out-TPS the healer, the dps have tons of options to not die.
---
Seems like you need to do more damage for the additional threat. Look into getting some TPS weapons.
---
In old original classic, I played Survival.  I did it for the same reason I did in Dark Age of Camelot.  When someone sees you shooting arrows at them, what's the first ting they do?  They close to melee range.
---
Normally, hunters are very squishy against pure melee classes.  But being able to go toe-to-toe in melee range for even a few seconds made huge difference.
---
I always used a 2h pole arm because I wanted the biggest single hit dmg possible.  My gear was all blue with STA, AGI, +Dodge, +Crit.  I would start with a normal ranged rotation. Then, when they closed in for the kill, I would: wing clip, raptor strike, mongoose bite, counterattack  (all on a spam macro button), run through them, jump spin, start shooting again. By this time, most would be at half health or less, or dead if crits went off.  Rinse repeat. All the time, my Death Flayer (rare scorpid with ridiculous attack speed and poison) was ignored and steadily chewing them up.  1 to 2 melee passes later, they were dead.
---
This worked even when they got the jump on me.  Being able to Survive was the key.  It means you don't have to constantly run and shoot to keep out of melee range.  In fact, you want to stand still, use your strongest shots and lure them into melee range.
---
Bonus: Survival hunter will kill any other hunter on the field in PvP.  You can't out-DPS them, but you can outlast them.  Survivalist and Surefooted FTW.
---
In PvE, just act like a normal hunter. Shoot things, lay freezing trap, take a nap, etc...
---
Feeling entitled to a gold drop just because it can be used by your class is greedy. If you feel entitled to any other BOE purple, that's greedy too.
---
cool fantasy universe you got there.
---
Because this isn't a second job and we aren't co-workers. I'm not obligated to make other peoples time more efficient and our buy-in to the world is the same so we don't have authority over each other.  People are not entitled to perfect farming and their expectation that everyone should kowtow to some efficiency matrix is juvenile and naive. Our different approaches are what makes this environment unique and the people following a g/h guide are all subscribing to the same approach. That's fine but I don't need to be a part of your g/h religion, thanks.
---
So only certain areas require a bobber?
---
Well they never asked me if I want the 3-4 gold that my water costs  without a mage for the heals, did they? But if they ask politely, I can shove my mana tide up their ass sideways.
---
The real winners of classic currently are really warlocks and druids, hunters too which is most suprising.
---
Removing layers would make it seem more populated than previously though...
---
Phase 2 is adding Dungeons and the PvP system, but nothing else. PvE and gearing wise the focus won’t change much
---
I'm playing with walk toggled always on, to really smell the roses.  
---
But I'm a bit stuck because I keep getting kicked from dungeon groups.
---
Can pitbull track energy ticks?  If not, what is a good addon for doing this?
---
Yes, and in that what if scenario OP is entitled as fuck if he refuses to tank while at the same time refuses to leave the group.
---
What’s the PvP like, can you burst people down fast?
---
She had no idea where she was in space. She'd get turned around and lost very easily. Like, leave town, go kill this. Once the town was behind her, she'd struggle to rotate and turn the character/camera to find it again.

Keep defending your brainlet ways of playing a 15 year old game
---
Yes, there is a guild blacklist
---
2v1 sounds about right.
---
Tanking is piss easy. Some idiots just get tanksiety and think it's harder than it is. You just need to be able to handle aggro from braindead party members as well as mobs.
---
You absolutely do not have to stack Str and play Seal of Command in the wild.
---
Going down Holy (or going Prot at level 40) is fully doable while leveling.
---
Mmm, I can smell the acidity from here.
---
Troll for threat, Tauren for tankiness.
---
(Pick what you like visually though, imo).
---
holy shit that was fucking intense! up until you died anyway!
---
Someone who tries really hard, so taking the game serious
---
It's kinda in the word.
---
How do you get your loot items to show in the middle of the screen like that? Mine are always stuck to the left of the screen and I can't work out how to move them.
---
Just chiming in as a long time Alliance player who got persuaded into playing Horde for Classic. I ended up rolling a tauren because they seemed like the most "pleasant" race to me... Psychology is funny sometimes!
---
easy: one tank, one heal, one dps
---
its foolproof
---
Awesome.
---
Or if the mats aren’t on the AH, I’m on a high pop pvp server and other than like fire and water, there’s like 5 max of the other essences on the AH at once.
---
Cool thing is, Atleast death coil crits
---
dude I'm sick of the Crossroads already
---
yea i fully thought it was gonna be the priest because of the unit frame at the start and creeping into second place.
---
Then... it happened. fucking POG
---
I would think as long as the sunder stack timer is reset, the threat is still generated.
---
It was when i xfered there. Now however its just keep growing. I didn't regret 1 bit transfering here with my guild
---
It’s not greedy if it’s used by your class only and is BiS, that’s an incredibly stupid way to view things and is really only a way to verify your own greedy view for a gold drop. Plain and simple. It’s fucking BiS for one class, how stupid can you be to not think that’s a need for that class only. Everyone else can greed roll for the gold they would get from the mage that has to buy it from the AH because it doesn’t drop for them or they’re stuck with a bunch of greedy assholes rolling need on an item they will literally only make gold off of and not use for anything much less their best in slot item. Sorry, but if you’re too ignorant to make that distinction then I’m done talking to a wall.
---
as orc :|
---
True! 
---
As many say in discussions, murlocs just wanna protect what's theirs, which I respect. Therefore I love this particular quest about finding the two missing guards because you (an unknowing outsider) gets to see the direct consequences of intruding on murloc grounds before doing the exact same thing yourself when searching for the second guard :p
---
What would you like to see posted here?
---
Its normal in every group and server I have played on to do it differently then you. Repeating yourself doesn't change that neither of our personal experiences matter
---
ofc not. felstriker bis off hand tank weapon.
---
I got 2x rog/warr lvl 60 and my Druid is lvl 44... Can't settle on a main. Druid is most fun tho.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
What is brc
---
A google search for “wow classic does mend pet scale” 
---
First link: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mend_Pet
---
Many times do a search with wow classic preface many of the sites will have the information for future references specific to spell mechanics to this.
---
Answer is no. Other useful info there too.
---
I'm not convinced any duration is better in every situation.
---
You *can* get undercut and still sell your item though.
---
Why the fuck would you exit game without checking vendor buyback?
---
Timbermaw, just got time investment
---
there are better MH if you are not using the set bonus.
---
Yeah so I’ve just started speccing Into resto. At 52 my spec is 38/0/5 right now I think. Early levels I went with omen of clarity spec so usually I’d cast to quest until I got to 20% mana then I’d bandage up and switch to cat form. With omen of clarity spec your damage in cat form is still pretty good with free casts and 10% physical damage, but that is at like low levels like 35 and below. Near 40 I respecced into full boomkin spec and I mainly cast now. 
---
No extra gear in bags none of that shit just prioritize intel/spirit/spell damage. Resto spec is not required to heal in dungeons until the more serious ones like BRD Strat Scholo. The biggest thing you need to heal dungeons while leveling is just the stats. You’re gonna need that intel for your mana pool and spirit to regen efficiently after the 5 seconds rule.
---
After I respecced full boomkin the name of the game in questing is mana management. Try to give yourself a spell cap on each mob. Currently I try to limit my spells to 3 or 4 spells per mob to save on drinking time. my rotation is starfire/moonfire/starfire/starfire. After you hit your spell cap on the mob just finish it off with melee and thorns aura. This way you’ll get a little bit of mana back while finishing off a mob and use less to finish him. You should be able to kill 4-6 mobs efficiently, and when you get innervate you can use it and drink up to full mana in about 10 seconds and start round 2 of mob killing.
---
How can you be over level 50 with such a tiny bank!? I bought the 25g slot at level 45 and filled all slots with 14 slot bags.
---
Also, what addon adds the different loading screen.
---
edit: Why is this getting downvoted? I'll never understand the people on this website. What "elitist" would admit to spending somewhere around 50% of their gold on bank space and bags. You're all projecting something onto me that I didn't say.
---
edit 2: Nah I’m doubling down, you’re all morons if you read this as me acting like an elitist. I can’t provide context of how much money I had to spend just to store my leather and shit? This guy is literally a fucking leatherworker.
---
Fuck off kids with shit reading comprehension who project the worst intentions on others harmless comments. Give me more downvotes you sensitive babies.
---

I agree with this. Tanked a ZF run today and one mage in particular was very impatient. Always asking me to pull more and then at some point started to pull himself. When we had to wait for our healer (since he died in the stairs event when the mage just pullt a bunch at the end), he just talked to the freed alliance npcs and started the fight. No healer, we of course wiped. I called him egotistical and asked him why and he replied saying he didn't want to wait any longer. Then he left. Feels like retail brought the most impatient and efficiency driven players into classic and it made me stop tanking for groups with more than 1 mage in it, since they always want to " aoe bomb everything!".
---
It's on the Twitch App and on their website https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files version 2.15.2-classic.
---
Fuck off
---
I mean, that was true in 2005 too
---
Most druids with a pulse were walking around with 8/8 stormrage shortly after bwl released. There just weren't very many of them so as long as you logged on and weren't afk during the bidding process you were destined to get decked out
---
 Ditto for warlocks and their sets since they were so unbelievably weak until they got some serious buffs to bring them up to par
---
Hunters are another case of knowing better. They just scale terribly and this wasn't known back then but is ominously acknowledged today, so not as many people will roll them
---
48 and only killing mobs related to quests with the occasional aggro stack along the way. Haven't run a single dungeon yet. 
---
Requires some heavy travel between zones but definitely not impossible to never sit and grind for no other reason but to do it. Plenty of quests have horrid drops rates anyway.
---
Healing a level 82 dungeon? In classic? At level 12? Hmmmmm. You sure its BRC
---
I don't see the issue with skipping trash. It's my 25th run of LBRS to get the damn crossbow, I'm sick of these packs by now!
---
But before level 60... yeah, maybe not
---
Because it needed a button and a name. Priority 1/2/3 just doesnt have the same ring to it.
---
So if a BOE purple axe drops, you would let a melee dps just have it? As long as they promise to equip it?  If yes, then you are extremely generous, but that isn't the norm or the expectation. When gold drops, such as a BOE, everyone values that gold equally.
---
What server is this btw?
---
I’ve been leveling as holy &amp; did so in BC. There isn’t enough int mail &amp; plate to only have 1 set of gear. Even at 60 paladins wear mostly cloth &amp; leather so I don’t see how they can fit OP’s concerns.
---
He means RFC, and to answer the op's question no not really. You should not face much of a challenge as long as you aren't spamming spells til oom.
---
Expecting to be able to join groups as DPS isn't entitled at all you little shit.
---
It's how the other 7 out of 8 classes play the fucking game.
---
If you mean RFC, then nothing extra is needed other than a +int set. Just try not to overheal and you'll be fine.
---
It's not really luck. The window is quite forgiving and you know full well they are spamming death coil button, waiting for stun to run out.
---
The birds are worse. There's always at least one group hanging out at the only place where more than one at a time spawns.
---
Been making a lot of these sets and for some reason I always vendor the gauntlets when cleaning my bags.  Luckily I always noticed in time to buyback but has happened like three or four times.  Something about the icon screams vendor me.
---
going into the lowbie zones and finding and watching the actual new players, slowly keyboard turning, take forever to eat/drink/loot/etc is actually adorable  
---
its even more adorable when they finally notice the ?? mounted nearby targetting them, and you can see the moment they target you, visibly panic, and start running
---
Yes it still generates threat so it's definitely not wasted. Make sure you keep shield slam on cooldown as this is your best ability by far to generate threat in terms of threat gained per rage point spent. But it sounds like you already used revenge and shield slam. If the you lose aggro on a boss, after a taunt it's usually best to immediately follow up with a shield slam which should give you a substantial lead in threat that you can follow up by more sunder armor/revenges. 
---
Other than that I'm not really sure what to tell you, since you seem to be doing everything right. Make sure the dps give you enough time to start getting threat at the beginning. If they immediately go all in then it's not your fault.
---
&lt;cries in enhance shaman&gt;
---
Really level 12 is such a short portion of your playtime. You are overthinking this far too much. Worry about that stuff later. RFC is not MC.
---
Yes, switching is important. Nottevolo has an incredible write-up, but he missed something important. Disarm is a 1 minute cooldown and completely shuts down any melee class for its duration.
---
If you have Tactical Mastery - and if you don't, spend 1g to get it and Anger Management - then as soon as you get 20 rage and are against a Warrior, Rogue, or Enhancement Shaman, pop into Defensive and hit Disarm. 
---
It helps against Hunters, too, because it takes away their Wing Clip and will give you an easier time sticking to them as a result. Just be aware that it won't remove ranged weapons.
---
Yeah, I stumbled upon this around when he started the 1-60 series, and I love it.
---
There are more DPS we can make happy than a prima donna by recruiting them over tolerating a prima donna warrior that doesn't know its role. Including the Shaman, Paladin, Druid, or Huntard trying to make due currently in the party.
---
Didnt say kind regards so kick him out of the guild you don't need that kind of disrespect....
---
Pay for one month of sub time and try it and you don’t like it you only lost 15 bucks which is the equivalent to like 2 chicken burritos at chipotle
---
That was probably me

---
Haven't you gotten any guild invites?
---
Are there no guilds on your server advertising on trade chat that they welcome social/leveling players? I don't think that's possible.
---
&gt;what is the goal?
---
To get better gear, so that you can beat harder bosses, so that you can get better gear, so that you can beat harder bosses... etc, ad infinitum
---
Here is a quick easy website for ya. 
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing\_skill\_requirements\_by\_zone](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing_skill_requirements_by_zone)
---
It sure does, but you'll want revenge, shield slam, and other generators after 5/5 sunder
---
Don't stop sundering, but don't forget you have other high threat abilities
---
Yay, I have a bunch of those! They'll message as soon as I login and I can't do anything else except dungeons since I want to help them all out lol. I love them though.
---
Only got mine to level 36 atm but can usually kill 3 maybe 4 mobs my level without dying. Not trying to be rude and tell people they suck or anything just saying Warriors don’t suck they just require more technique
---
The only thing you missed was the usefulness of Disarm. Against other Warriors and Enhance Shamans, you can see the disconnect as they realize what happened. With Weapon Chains relatively rare and expensive even still, it's a strong option against anyone with a melee weapon. 
---
Hunters can't Wing Clip, Rogues can't do anything from what I'm aware, and Warriors will almost always swap into Defensive Stance themselves before realizing they can't Disarm you without a weapon. It's a very powerful anti-melee tool.
---
I still think it is apples to oranges. In WoW people have all the time in the world to talk shit, whereas in mobas your gameplay will be affected a lot worse by typing, and it is always the same generic crap that is said, you become immune to it quickly. There is progression in both games, most people will never make it to top league in league, but most people don’t expect to. In WoW you could do everything right and never get the drop you wanted. You could spend all day trying to take a pet and have your own faction ruin it for you if you aren’t getting corpse camped by other faction. Meanwhile you have people writing you a novel about how terrible you are. Totally different. It isn’t my fault you lack imagination. You didn’t really think that through now did you? League is more ephemeral, your game palette consistently cleansed from match to match. Not so in WoW. Bad matches can accumulate, but it is easier to step away from league than it is WoW from Match to match. Instances last longer and can be much more of a slog than your average league match. I haven’t played league in a very long time, so maybe I can’t speak on it as well, but if it is anything like Dota 2, the rage is much more fleeting than in WoW.

Expecting to join a group as a dps *without* being *ever* declined, yea, that's entitled as fuck.
---
First time wow player here started about a month ago played as undead mage found out mid 20s that it isnt my class so i went with rogue love it community is helpful towards new players you definitely should play classic find yourself a good guild play a few classes and decide which one you like the most and max it out
---
The stacks wont go up any further, but you still apply treath with it (and every other attack)
---
Depends how many you’re gonna make. If you’re just making 1 potion then no it won’t be profitable. If you keep farming herbs and making pots then yes, it will always be profitable.
---
You mean the double standard of DPS classes demanding someone not be allowed to DPS so that they can sit comfortablely with their DPS class?
---
If only quests would actually have such understandable reasoning.
---
Instead basically every innocent level 6 human wanders into the goldshire inn and is greeted by a psychopath named William Pestle who tells you that he needs some candles to deliver to Stormwind. No big deal until he tells you that you can get them by killing kobolds. Like, I get that humans and kobolds aren't exactly the best of friends but that's just wrong.
---
You have a couple options. Most obvious are gathering professions, like herbalism and mining, and fishing. You can also make a ton of money with some crafting professions, like buying herbs low for alchemy and selling pots on common raid days. Tailoring to make bags usually works pretty well too, and you might already be a tailor for your robes. 
---
The other option you have is when dm drops, you can farm lasher's in DM:E. Basically you just need gear with enough int to put you 5700+ Mana, and the holy damage/healing from the holy treee. You aggro the pack, shield, and mash that spell until they're all dead. 
---
For ease of playing, I recommend herbalism and fishing.
---
Enjoy! Hunters got years of this so my terrible self is reveling it in.
---
Thoughts or feelings about the whirlwind sword? From a non-minmax perspective, is it really that much worse than the axe? Will it be easier to maintain an axe in weapon slot and avoid respecing from sword spec?
---
Why am I crying in the club rn
---
Awesome, thank you!!
---
VanasKos ( I think that's the name) does this, as well as let's you take notes on players and add them to nice/hate/Kos lists
---
Yeah. Most locks I run with aren't an issue at all. It's just a certain type of player who constantly life taps and stands inside melee range of the mobs so you really can not tell what is happening to them.
---
Yea, races mainly. My favourite races have always been Trolls and Blood Elves.
---
Now, for warlock I started a female orc at first for the stun racial mostly but I just can't play her, so rerolled undead male which I like a lot more (animations, emotes/voice, general feel). For hunter started with male orc because pet damage, but same thing here - don't like animations and the race in general so rerolled troll male. My mains on retail are hunter (troll) and druid (zTroll), and I realized I like those two the most on Classic as well.
---
And for classes, sometimes I get a sudden urge to try something else and all their cool shit come to mind (like all the totems with shaman, the forms with druid, I really like pet classes so hunter and warlock).
---
I go back and forth between hunter and lock the most - I feel like warlock would be better for wPvP but I just like hunter so much.
---
I also really like healing and don't mind the hybrid tax *too much*, I'd be very happy to main a healer druid/shaman for raids but I'm afraid of wPvP with those :(
---
Classic is a little different i think. Progress kills don't matter as much because the content all the way through Classic is considered extremely easy. Hard core players will care more about the status symbols like HoR a TF.
---
Lets not forget World First Rag was killed on week one and the raid was comprised of mostly sub level 60s in green gear.
---
At that level greens become what whites were at level 15, you're best to just vendor them. It's rare you'll find a green that is an upgrade, and even if it is, no one wants to pay any real amount of gold  when they'll just get something from Mara or BRD eventually.
---
yuurrrr
---
whenever I use /castsequence reset=....    nothing happens and i hear a click. Am i missing something?
---
Wait, are shamans supposed to have an easier time vs higher level enemies than priests? Can not confirm.
---
Why not just make 10 louder?
---
Go for tab mauls over swipe. Holds aggro much better.
---
İ am planning to both farm herbs and buy cheap on AH if i see a great deal. İ wont make couple of potions. İ will make hundreds, maybe thousands in time and will try to keep competetive in my server.
---
100% confirmation bias. And people seem to think they are rarer than they are. A 2.5% drop chance is going to yield many weapons with this many people playing
---
Yea good idea. Also props the best way for someone to justify is by comparing to food lol, I'm about it lol
---
As a person who always rolls tank. I main a druid and a warrior.
---
I always prefer a good mage over a good warlock. The mage brings a lot to a dungeon. Free water for the casters and food for me. Polymorph is just amazing. Good damage.
---
And no fucking pet. I can't tell you how many times a lock or hunter doesnt understand how to use their pet.
---
This is why I said a good mage vs a good warlock.
---
I've also had many dumbass mages. And a few good warlocks that shine. Gave me a headstone and soulstone the healer incase of wipe. Waits a second to get IMP to attack. Ranged dps doesnt pull aggro as easy. And because most dot they dont pull aggro like a mage can. Though usually that's if the mage is aoe aka a bad mage. (If you're aoeing without that being communicated before hand by the WHOLE GROUP then yes a bad mage).
---
Really I like them both as long as they play well. So far my last favourite 2 dps to bring are a hunter and a rogue. So if you're a lock or a mage I'm likely to invite you.
---
those two better have another pair of friends named redshock blueshock
---
 funny i didn't say that mf. little salty seeing you downvote me because i am disagreeing.
---
&gt;without being ever declined
---
And where the fuck are you pulling this from?  Straight out of your ass?
---
OP has literally NEVER said anything about expecting to get in groups as a DPS.  Literally the ONLY thing they said was if they answer a call for a DPS, they want to DPS not be suddenly asked to tank instead.
---
How can you be this dumb?
---
And William fucking Pestle continually sends adventurers to kill them for their candles because apperently humanity doesn't know about beekeeping yet.
---
typical horde players
---
Badlands earth elementals.
---
It's phase 3, not 2 as the other guy said. Phase 2 is just adding honor, which will make WPvP kinda crazy.
---
Definitely priest based on your restriction but it’s an unnecessary restriction. It’s very very easy to build a healing set that you leave in the bank while questing. Green +healing or +int drops all the time.
---
I leveled by paladin starting with 30 posts in ret then filling out the holy tree. Healed every dungeon along the way and never had a hard time getting gear. You can often do dungeons earlier than most classes. I healed BRD at lvl 50 and started building my raid healing set fast.
---
I also wouldnt recommend taking improved heroic strike until 60. You wont be using it often while leveling and the extra % to parry will help decrease hits from enemy mobs. It's better than missing and still being hit.
---
&gt;pvp ranks  
---
&gt; More of an individual achievement than a guild one. You just account share or pvp for 12+ hours a day.
---
If you want to reach high PvP ranks, you need to run with a premade. The best premades are organized by hardcore guilds.
---
There's a reason why APES managed to gear up a good chunk of their players with rank 14 gear on every single private server that they played on.
---
Are you trolling mate?
---
Bet this guy is drowning in punani
---
WHY one or  eight?
---
yeah pvp.Guilds cared about pvp as well.Shaman windfury and Hand is just awesome
---
DNB stands for 'Den Norske Bank' which is 'The Norwegian Bank' in English.
---
MOBA’s can ruin your entire day
---
Warlocks are worse if they are bad. They have much worse survival tools and tend to just pop.
---
you're on a high horse because you're acting superior to the "instant gratification generation"
---
gr8 dEBaTe SlkillZ
---
I RP most of the times I go to IF.
---
What? You're going to pay 82S for 10 Seconds of cast time?
---
&gt; And people playing classic understand that tanks have limited tools in their kits.
---
Ye that's just a lie or you've ended up with real luck to get good players, The majority of dps playing really don't know or don't give a fuck about tanks work in classic.
---
Shhh, stop telling people about the turtles. I'm always happy to get to a new zone and find a nice quiet spot of turtles to murder.
---
What spamming general chat? lol most people know mages offer this, they are just doing it to make money.
---
What do people use now?
---
Asking for a friend
---
Definitely agree that specialized blues that are mail/plate with intel stats are few and far between, but it wouldn’t be impossible to get a lot of mail with Of The Gorilla on it for Str and Intel. Paladins can also benefit from a bit of spell damage on their seal, consecration, and holy shock so putting down mobs by yourself without too much trouble is definitely possible. Holy with gorilla gear is also great for staying alive with the intel against  multiple mobs since you’ll probably have concentration aura on as you heal yourself letting your consecration do the work.
---
Personally I'd spam seduction while stunned
---
+64
---
I had that quest for like 7 levels before it turned yellow.
---
Felcloth. The drop rate is abysmal and everyone and their mother is farming it.
---
Can, but still much harder for them to in my experience. Much much harder. Never ruined my day and played for years. WoW on the other hand probably has ruined a few. I am just going off of my experience. Haven’t played MOBAs for years the way I used to, last time was around Dota 2 international, lost plenty of matches, but wasn’t that invested, so maybe it is just because WoW is more fresh on the mind.
---
Just keep playing your way mate - an astounding amount of information on YouTube or wowhead is incorrect or a waste of time. Like the mara runs - I get the feeling this is advertised so hard because it brings more gold into the server economy therefore making other grinds more valuable. Often the little known locations are the most lucrative.
---
If you pull 3 mobs of equal level as a warrior you actually just dont have enough aoe to handle them all, as far as i can tell from 1-24 so far 3+ mobs has meant death
---
Tip for anyone: If you do this and it doesn't work... paste it into a chat then DELETE the quotation marks and RE-ENTER the quotation marks. Some regions change the quote character to one that WoW doesn't like.
---
Yes, thats pretty much it.
---
One guildie sourced 2 ignots for 600g, bargain.
---
Yeah they just do it cause it's easier. Go in WPL and every field has at least 1 mage aoe grinding the mobs there, no other class can aoe farm as efficiently as them
---
There is actually a guild called Union of Bankers  
---
TBH I think they have no chance to face our Bank :D
---
It depends on your class, did you make a new character?  
---
My buddy kept asking this question, and he is a druid. I am a rogue and all my skills auto update. It comes down to certain classes benefitting from using a level 3 spell even though they have level 5 available. So mages, priests, druids, and probably more classes have many abilities that won't auto update.
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
Is it bad that I thought you said five silver
---
If that item is a BiS this yes I would not roll on it.
---
They should also fix the evade bug that allows you to even do this farm....
---
We currently have more than 200 Bankers! and still trying to snach other bankers from other guilds too :p
---
I don't know if it's still a setting but I would always set my tab to target players and shift tab to target mobs.. might help!
---
It doesn't matter what people say, lol I've been 60 for a week and have my epic mount now so I'm obviously not doing to bad for myself :)
---
&gt; And where the fuck are you pulling this from? Straight out of your ass?
---
That's literally what he's pissed about, he's pissed that people tell him "no, you can't dps in our group" but then add a "however, if you want you can tank".
---
Yeah. I get that vibe about Malfurion too. Defo Balance.
---
I mean losing one game doesn’t make me that upset. Losing another right after makes me annoyed. Losing anything after about 3-4 just ruins it. And by lose, I don’t mean like super intense and nail biting. I mean like me going 2-13, jg going 0-15, support rolling an adc and no support item, and mid just bitching the entire game. Because that happens
---
I don't use an addon. Just wrote this in chat:
---
 /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Promoted :D
---
Hence why my farmer will be either a hunter or warlock maraudon farmer.
---
now win both.
---
Who hurt you?  Because it's obvious that you aren't even reading what people are saying and are just assuming shit about OP to get pissed off about.
---
This is not what everyone sees, you've got something funky going on.  There should be a little yellow triangle in one of the categories, showing which one and which direction it is sorted by.
---
Yours is missing- you've got an addon making things worse.
---
Laughs in warlock
---
5 days on /played is WAY too much for level 40. Thats 120 hours, or 3 hours per level.
---
Maybe he meant it’s easier to run past mobs? Earthbound totem, wolf form, earthclaw totem, frost shock, etc.
---
I had kind of been hoping for the whole horde/alliance affair being broken open at some point resulting in 3 factions and new alliances. Not sure who should be together though.
---
ITT: people flaming for being casual noobs and not giving to enhance shaman, forgetting good guilds dont have enhance shamans
---
Yah horde 58-42 our advantage
---
It's literally not.
---
He says he'll DPS.  He gets invited.
---
Then the group asks him to tank instead.
---
He doesn't mind not joining the group.  He minds people flip flopping immediately like that.
---
Read the fucking conversation you twit.
---
&gt;But if you dont see anything wrong with **inviting me as a dps** then **expecting me to tank**
---
Badlands
---
Give it a try sometime honestly. Outside of top end content tanking just means taking hits to get rage and then spending that rage on damaging abilities. Keep the 2H out and have fun, unlimited rage is kind of a beautiful thing. On AOE pulls, you only need enough AOE TPS to stop the healer from pulling aggro, dps all have ways to tank trash mobs (eg Frost Nova, Drain Life, etc). Charge, whirlwind, sweeping strikes, let loose with damage.
---
Today a guy started fishing next to me. Told him to get out of my swamp. He traded me bleach. 10/10
---
You can manually search the zones in classic db
---
I’m not sure what your confusion is. Some people enjoy acquiring the mats themselves to give a sense of accomplishment. Why is that such a difficult concept for some people to understand? I play wow to enjoy what i’m doing, and mindless gold grind followed by ah shopping ain’t that.
---
Dwarfs and Gnomes are considered the best choices for PvP Rogues. Stoneform can drop poisons and bleeds so you can stone vanish a Rogue or a Warrior. You can also remove a blind as it’s considered a poison in classic. Gnome escape artist is great for removing a snare every minute. Some say that Dwarf is the best choice for 1v1 and Gnome best for group PvP.
---
Humans are best for PvE damage because the extra 1% hit works out as a substantial dps gain with swords.
---
I went Dwarf because they look cool swinging swords and I believe stoneform to be best for my uses.
---
İ am in casual guild and all people are broke :) Even if they has it they wouldnt just give me 200-300g+ recipes for free.
---
I just fail to see why BIS vs non BIS matters whatsoever in this discussion lol. If it's BOE, it's buyable. That's LESS important an item than a BOP item.
---
I now very much understand why this game has such rabid fanboys for the last 15+ years. My experience as a new to WoW casual has been amazing. This game has so many great gameplay concepts I still don't see any modern game implementing correctly to this day.
---
Reached 37 on a Horde Warlock yesterday, I have zero interest in doing end game content from what I've heard about how brutal it is (and dealing with guild drama) but my goal is to get 60 and the final lv60 mount before I hang out the game.
---
I've never played a game that makes it so easy to organically meet random players, team up and tackle content together or help each other out without a matchmaking menu.
---
Currently trying to rush to lv 41 so I can finish the last 20 lvs of alchemy I need to learn transmute arcanite and make the big boy cash.
---
Just boot his ass
---
Alternatively, roll need on every single item he could possibly want for any reason, even if it's BOP
---
After all, you need gold for a mount, right?
---
If you die, you did it wrong.
---
Blizzard got it more right than wrong with personal loot in retail. It’s not perfect but it’s far superior to classic.
---
Are you asking about buying materials or buying recipes? You said recipes but now I’m honestly unsure.
---
If you buy recipes you’ll make your money back and then some. If you buy materials you might make some money but you’ll make more farming materials.
---
Either way I’d say buy the recipes you want asap because they will go up in price when more people are 60.
---
I personally play on incendius and find it relatively balanced. I've heard good things about kromkrush and sulfuras though.
---
Netherwind is pretty good for balance I’ve noticed
---
Sulfaras is like 54/46 Horde  last I saw. Not too bad
---
as someone who hasn't played retail before, how easier/harder it is to find people for dungeons ? I like most aspects about classic from an outsider, but farming some prebis items from dungeons takes a long time, and most of it is waiting on tanks/healers or people 15mins away from the instance. I'm almost lvl 60, and this is the most gruesome part so far, because leveling has been smooth sailing
---
And dont listen to this guy
---
How did you get the plans?
---
This is sick dude
---
Have you even listened to the OP? They are fine if they say the group doesn't want them. What they are saying is stop getting angry at them for being a DPS when he joined an Open DPS slot. Ie. Be respectable about it.
---
Also, as the OP stated originally if they are soooo upset about their not being enough Tanks that the refuse to take a Warrior DPS, why don't they make a Tank then? If they think it is so easy tank yourself. You will quickly see that it isn't that there is a shortage of Tanks... its that the Tanks are avoiding PUG's because of the DPS who don't understand aggro management is different between Classic and Retail. The same DPS who think the Cleave meta is the only way to play and try to force all groups (even ones they joined so it isn't their group as you like to put it) to do that method. This leads to the DPS pulling aggro off of the Tanks and causing wipes but is somehow the Tanks fault.
---
The OP doesn't want to Tank such groups because they are entitled and they definitely are.
---
Eastern kingdom, undead run to booty bay
---
 /cast !cat form
---
That is called going out of your way to get upset. Maybe I did not experience that because When I play mobas I play with friends most of the time, and I change up heroes and roles when things aren’t working out, instead of stubbornly setting myself up for continued failure.
---
If you mean RFC... I've healed it on a Druid &amp; Priest. The key thing is to respect the 5-second rule; if you haven't finished a cast within 5 seconds, you begin to regain mana. Now I don't know if this holds true for high levels, but I generally try to avoid casting until actually needed, then dropping off a few casts on the tank and party members if required. 
---
I didn't find downranking too useful at this point, maybe just to top up a DPS after you've healed the tank. I also found it easiest to use the most mana-efficient almost exclusively. Your PW:S should only be used in emergencies really, as it slows Rage generation for your bear/warrior tank. 
---
You may have a hard time, it honestly depends on your tank &amp; DPS. I often had issues when the DPS would be attacking random mobs within a pull, resulting in 2-3 people getting hit instead of just the tank.
---
If you pull anything other than the skull i agree
---
He's just angry you're stealing all the mobs he's been farming... oh wait...
---
I haven't played wow since late BC. So I've never played with personal loot. But the idea sounds good tbh.
---
İ meant recipes for learning to make them. Mats are not so much problem. İ can farm them myself. Thanks, i will try to get them as soon as possible.
---
Gear-wise, can I excel at PvP if I don’t participate in any PvE?
---
Feralas?
---
WHERE ARE THEY?
---
Nice, I just got the staff because of your comment and commenter before you. Going for the wand now! Thanks for the reply.
---
I was really sad to find out that there were no hallucinogens for the last shaman quest.
---
Wow. One of my dream items.
---
Where did the recipe drop?
---
Do you have such a pathetic existence that you can only take pride in how your subreddit is superior to the more mainstream version? Because I can't think of another reason to act like this and it's pitiful
---
Wasted on warriors , poor shamans..
---
At level 36 you have cleave, sweeping strikes, thunderclap, demoralizing shout, whirlwind, and retaliation to deal with larger pulls. You also can hamstring kite and fear things.
---
The fact that OP is a Warrior makes those statements the same thing. BTW you meant "taking a Warrior" not "Talking"
---
APES don't do this shit for views, they've been poopsocking their way through almost every big private server in the past several years simply because their collective autism compels them to dedicate all their free time to a fifteen years old mmo.
---
The thing that will make them even more notorious in the future won't be raid clears, it will be phase 2 world PvP.
---
You are very willfully ignorant.
---
Only if the dps cooperate and manage their threat. Which they don't.
---
As a mage should I use the Illusory rod or the hypnotic dagger with the orb offhand?
---
I would have expected a Dwarf named Wallbang to carry a gun. I guess it does mean something different here.
---
If enough people try this, some of them will die.
---
There is a function that auto-forms groups and teleports you to the dungeon. As a tank or healer, dungeon queues are almost always instant. As a dps, usually around 5-10 minutes, though sometimes around half an hour.  
---
Edit: hire a tank or healer. I'd rather farm than tank something I don't need gear from. Throw 10g at me and I'm in.
---
The flat damage reduced is rather small, yes. Every little bit helps, though. Also, shields have an obscene armor value for the slot, and are currently worth an extra 16% damage reduction on my character. Since you can't block without a shield, I think it's fair to consider that damage reduction gain as part of it.
---
There are other benefits to a block, too. A blocked hit can't be a crushing blow, although I'm not sure if a block overwrites a crit.
---
Weird how they won't add arathi basin until later. I swore that wsg and arathi were released at the same time
---
My only rule with tanking is that I set the pace, not the DPS. The only person who can override that is the healer.
---
This means the first few pulls I'm going to be a little cautious while I gauge the group, so if you want to be pulling more then don't be shit, don't pull aggro from me, and just let me handle it. You do that, I promise I'll up the size of the packs accordingly. You act like retards and keep almost getting us killed and they'll get smaller.
---
Easily my biggest annoyance are the DPS who won't wait **literally** the 3 seconds it takes for me to go get the mobs. I'm not even asking for much guys, I just want the initial threat and rage generation of everything attacking me. It makes tanking easier and it makes it more fun. What isn't fun is running all over the place every single pull because you just want to spam two buttons and waiting that ever couple seconds to do it is too hard.
---
Maybe I'm just a bad tank, and it is a secondary role for me as my main is a rogue, but I love smashing in to a big group and watching my rage soar and all my abilities light up. It's fun! I *don't* like having every pull be me fighting for rage because you want to win the metres and you're worried that extra couple seconds is going to hurt your numbers. Do not ruin my entire dungeon experience to be a selfish prick.
---
That said, most groups are really great about it and I just let the idiots die then kick them. DPS are easy to find more of and I've no time for their bullshit.
---
And whiny children like you is why I don't believe in democracy. I'll make a mage and single target farm and mine all day in front of you just to enjoy seeing you climbing up walls.
---
Tanks are so rare man I would never disrespect and risk spamming lfg for another half hour
---
How am i acting superior?  By stating facts?  Enlighten me.  I'm downvoting you because you're acting like a child and not contributing to the discussion, which is btw, what the downvote button was actually designed for.  Also I find it funny you have to reply twice to everything I say.  You say you don't have the rest of your life, but I disagree... you seem to have your entire life ahead of you, since you can't possibly be a day over 16 with the way you are acting.
---
I think he was joking lol
---
No warrior that will actually tank wants to compete with you for gear. So they leave you tankless as they get yet another group looking for a tank.
---
Kinda why I mentioned 'average', I know players that easily spend 6+ hours on a level because they get sidetracked with things other than leveling.
---
Some classes level up faster, some slower, same thing with players.
---
You can get to 60 in like 4 /played days, but I imagine most players take around 10~.
---
i explained myself. i told you don't have time for it. i told you i have a friend to keep up with.  I'm not debating because for one theres nothing to debate about.  tho you didnt need to explain yourself because i get it.  if you want to fully experience what it was like in the day this is it. what blizzard gave us and sorry but looks like everyone wants to pvp and do end game raids so things like questie are quality of life.  you and so many people here are mad that mamma isnt playing how i think she should be playing.  and that's fucking ridiculous.
---
Despite your name, this level of  triteness is just sad
---
What’s your talents like? Any min gear or weapon you recommend for taking out the boss?
---
Why would time spent making it correlate with how difficult it is to quest? The extra time in alliance zones mostly seems to have been spent on writing a ton of quest text and having the player walk around for ages for small xp rewards.
---
Lol the mindset of a scumbag
---
what discussion? what facts?
---
Sure, then imagine good guilds spending multiple thousands of gold on these maces that could have been used for consumables.
---
Also, you can mute other players and still win. I have never set someone to ignore in WoW, but if I did so in the middle of an instance, not sure how that would play out.
---
Im a druid and I think I can fly to Darkshore.
---
No better time than the present. The game is very alive right now.
---
It takes months to gear a full raid group yes because it's 40 people but that's not at all what you originally said.
---
&gt;Classic is supposed to last 2 years after all. If everyone gears up in 2 weeks, with every tier, that means classic essentially lasts only about 3 months for that 2 years
---
Second there is more the game then aquiring raid gear. Just because people can and will get geared up in a few weeks doesn't mean the lifespan of the game is going to drop to 3 months. Especially since the game and raid instances are being released in phases specifically to make what your talking about impossible. You can get fully geared from mc in a few weeks with some luck, but you can't get full T2 till it's actually released in the next phase, you can't get T2.5 until many months after that when that phase is released etc...
---
Good shit man. Hope one day u can share the bond of the game u love with her. Does she ever see u play it or ask questions about it?
---
And if OP wasn't an entitled brat wanting to never get declined he'd just say no thanks and if they wont agree to that then leave and that would be it, but no, he has to make an entire thread crying about it on reddit, so that leaves the single option that he's mad that some groups don't want him.
---
I’ve done as far as Mara so far with no issues and 0 points in holy. I’ll try sunken temple to,row but I can’t see it being a problem as long as we have a good tank. The only set back is that I have to drink after most pulls.
---
Worst doctor and worst assistant right there
---
Pretty much. My main is a rogue and the tank I run with knows that if I have aggro on something it's because I took it on purpose.. generally to pull it from a caster and bring it to him, or just because it's a low health healing mob and I'm gonna fuck it up. I can always lose aggro if I need, or he can take it away if he has a moment but it's fine.
---
Of course he's also far too good as a tank so he just pulls them off me anyway, but eh.
---
It's great for a pvp set.
---
Not everyone is the bis or garbage crowd.  You need stamina and int in pvp.
---
Volatile power is better once you go fire
---
Definitely harder. Priest actually has hit talents before 54 lol
---
&gt;If they want a tank so badly they should roll one themselves
---
Please tell me - How do I build the Shaman or Mage I want to play into a tank?
---
Wow what are the odds?
---
That is not true. Abiltiies such as sinister strike scales directly of weapon DAMAGE, not DPS. 
---
The normalization you are thinking about, is one that happened in vanilla because abilities such as sinister strike scaled off weapon damage + attack power, and the attack power part scaled again on how slow it was. So you basically got double bonus for having slow weapons. In classic or 1.12 you only get the fact that slow weapons hit harder as your bonus, it doesn't give extra ap scaling.

I'm not saying it's a good insult but IQ does go both ways, at the very least it works 50%. If your IQ is unlimited you are not limited in negative IQ either.

As a caster, be sure to wand a the totems as soon as they pop. Any kind of slow/snare/stun most cc really is generally lethal. A good enhancement shaman will have nature swiftness, but most are bad and only have stormstrike (24% mana and an extra swing, that’s probably not a crit and 20% nature damage). Those are far easier to kill.

---
Fuck you have weapons grade autism don't you.
---
Everyone sharing their protection rotations has done so under the assumption that you will be able to open with a charge. This is not helpful at all guys. The rage generation from charge allows you to easily unload a lot of solid threat on the mobs rather quickly.
---
The harsh reality is that you will not be able to open with charge quite often. If you want to be helpful, then share with other warriors rotations that begin from zero rage with just AA's or a ranged attack pull.
---
No, what's obvious is that I'm the only one who actually thinks about what people write and their possible motivation for doing so.

Oh man I finally got the one twink item I never got on vanilla. Wranglers wristbands of +5 stamina for my level 19 druid flag carrier. 
---
Sure it's no shadowfang, but I wanted that last 1stam forever back in the day and I just found it for 30s on the ah earlier. What a rush.
---
Bath salts specifically.
---
meme legendary lol..one you will never have. damn u mad
---
No, they won't, lol.  The hardcore players are in the hardcore guilds, those guilds don't give a shit about loot.  They care about being first at everything, and later being the fastest at everything.  World First Rag was APES, no one in APES cares about Hand of Rag, and everyone knows APES is the best guild in classic no matter what loot they have.
---
The problem is most healers aren't smart enough to let pulling dps die. They waste their mana healing them and then are OOM when the tank needs heals. I know because it happens all the time when I try to let bad dps kill themselves.
---
Vael? It also gives you unlimited mana so you could argue that hybrids with 1.12 talents will easily do the required damage.
---
get out of town, thats amazing
---
i see what you're saying, but in my opinion you aren't a "casual".  just because you don't min/max doesn't mean you're a casual, it just means you aren't hardcore.  a casual is more like someone who plays sometimes, but will often opt to do something else.  no casual spends all their free time playing.  
---
it's like a person who plays basketball (like not on a team) in their free time.  If they play basketball everyday for multiple hours you wouldn't say they are a casual player just because they aren't on a team. a casual would be someone who plays pickup every now and then or shoots in the driveway
---
I’m enchanter and the Greater intellect formula for bracers was 200g on AH and there was only one. Me and my friend decided to farm Vilebranch Shadowcasters for it instead. Got it in 3 hours farming time in 2 days. Get a guildie to help you out and grind out that recipe my dude! I was so fucking happy when my formula dropped since it dropped off of the last mob of the night for our farming session.

I give them 1s per water, but I usually only want 2 stacks. They give me 5 or 6 and demand a gold for the whole thing

Why even comment? Dude is telling a legitimate joke, and your response is just trying to cheese a few lame upvotes.
---
Now make a forsaken and run him down to booty bay
---
1. Post pic of guy needing leaving group putting on AH
---
2. Guy wins pattern on need role 
---
How do you not see the difference
---
I cannot. There isn't even a map coming up, it just says "I need a ride to Rut'Theran Village" or something like that, and you immediately pop onto a hippogryph.
---
You mean assume and project.
---
Wrong. Their Damage might shine after Blackrock but since they CAN do damage they are not exclusively Tanks saying they are is a form of entitlement.
---
Every class can be DPS and absolutely at no point is there a class that cannot be DPS.
---
I do agree he should find like minded people to play with though.
---
You could probably set tank as focus and make a jank macro to target the target of your focus
---
As someone else mentioned, having pet attack / follow on scroll wheel up / down feels incredibly natural. Outside of that and necrosis (which I highly recommend) I use an all-in-one pet macro that changes depending on what pet I have active (voidwalker sacrifice vs. succubus seduce, etc.).
---
Why would I ever want to acquire the mats for a virtually useless item outside of pvp meme specs for shaman or paladin?
---
Hence why I no longer tank. I no longer have the patience for bad dps.
---
Finally, an actual response.  I'm not saying questie is bad, and I agree it is quality of life for those of us who want to race to the end and raid and PVP.  However, just as you think *I* should not be dictating how mom should play, neither should *you*.   All I'm stating is that if you're going to introduce someone to the game, don't force *your* addons on them.  Let *them* choose.  Launch the game without addons and let them play.  If they then start complaining about a certain element, then say "you can change that with this addon".  Don't simply assume that *they* should instantly be shoehorned into playing how *you* want to.
---
I don’t believe RP servers have the same experiences
---
i try to embrace it. sometimes, like today, i obviously get triggered, but i wouldn't change a server to pve even in the heat of a moment. world pvp is part of the game for me.
---
Ohh okay, so I should just put my points mainly in balance tree but when in dungeon I can just be the healer then, right?
---
And when I hit 60 just respec to restoration then or what? And if respecced to resto, will soloing some quests still be doable?
---
Also, when you're leveling, do you just camp moonkin form most of the time when casting your spells?
---
And another question, if I would just use the gear with stats suitable for resto/balance, will casting untill you have just enough mana left for cat shift and  keep attacking in kitty form until mana is back up and repeat be a faster way to kill mobs?
---
Or would this method be slower/more dangerous since the gear I'm wearing isn't suitable for melee combat or would I just simply be wasting mana for shifting while I on't hit that much more than staff auto attack?
---
Thanks for your input so far, secretly I've been leaning towards druids but I was scared off because  I heard they should have many sets to be viable and that being a caster when leveling is the worse there is. I like the caster archetype way more than melee, but I can justify using cat form after mana is low if I have the choice between that or using auto attacks with staff lol.
---
Because every class brings something different to the table. Farming and dungeons are very comfortable for us, so why not go through just a little bit of hassle for our priest friends who chose a class that has it a lot less easy and one we all desperatly need so that they don't have to spend a fortune on water every session? I don't owe anyone anything but i recognize that this is what my class does, so I do it...
---
I really didn't think I had to...
---
Good for you. You were very lucky. İ will farm it for 15-20 hours, if i dont see one single recipe, i will most likely buy it from AH.
---
I tanked SM lib the other day on my warrior. I was blamed for 3 wipes, none of which were my issue.
---
- The healer was great
---
- The hunter, decided to pull a bunch of mobs wedidnt need. Repeatedly. 
---
- The warlock blamed me for not keeping aggro.
---
Kids who play retail WoW don't seem to get that warriors in classic require rage to keep aggro. If you have no rage, your tanking ability is limited.
---
Here are some tips:
---
Let the tank get a sunder or two on the mobs
---
Pay attention to the skull for what to kill
---
Focus DPS, if you're all hitting different mobs you're dumb
---
If you get aggro, run to the tank, not away from him, he isn't going to save you if he has to chase you miles and can't catch you. He may also die because out of healing range
---
If you bitch at your tanking being shit, they're probably just going to leave and immediately find a new group. They are after all, much more in demand than idiot hunters and whiney warlocks.
---
Tanking is not an easy job, don't make it harder, after 3 wipes and blaming the tank wrongly they're gonna not care about leaving you hanging unable to complete your dungeon.
---

A couple of high level friends are offering to give some enchantments for free.
---
For a thrash blade + flurry axe, fury warrior what should I ask for? 2x lifesteal for less downtime OR 2x crusader?
---
On my server it's comparably the same price actually around 60g each.
---
Personally, I'd try to avoid bringing little details into it else you will just complicate the decision. Tauren if you can tolerate the animations/kodos (or be bothered with rep farming), orc if you can't.
---
I would have puked in achenvale already.
---
"just because I rolled a hunter doesn't mean I rolled a DPS". That's how dumb this argument sounds.
---
The three roles in WoW are Tank, Healer, and Freeloader.
---
There is no dungeon finder in classic
---
You are absolutely right on all counts. Unfortunately if you wait even a second the DPS goes "you're ready, PULL!" and shoots/charges in/whatever. Then expects you to grab everything even though you don't have any rage.
---
If the full group attacks me, I'm golden. I'll have rage for days and enough threat that you can go nuts on the group without issue. 
---
What really irks me is that tanking when you have that few seconds to get rage and threat is significantly more fun than needing to run around and only just barely getting control as everything dies. But because you didn't wipe "lol its fine" and they do it again.
---
I join a group to tank and I straight up say: "Only rule: I pull the mobs, nobody else". People who don't agree can leave or I will.. I'm not making my run less fun and more stressful because you can't wait.
---
Because it’s best in slot it’s the biggest upgrade you can get? Why is that hard for you to see? Whether or not it’s buyable, it’s literally prioritizing your gold gain over someone’s best item they can equip in the entire game. That is greed. They need it to be the best player of their class they can be. You need it because....gold?  That’s asinine. If you can’t see that, then again, there’s no use in having this discussion.
---
Tells you how clueless people posting here are.
---
So did Tech N9ne
---
Bay of Storms in Azshara requires 425 fishing I believe for fish to have no chance of escaping. So you need to be maxed out with Nat Pagles Limited Edition fishing pole, and then equip aqua dynamic bobber or whatever which is +100. It’s got all the best fish in the game at Bay of Storms.
---
We're gonna get a lot of these posts, aren't we?

And he got what he paid for, too

Altarac/WSG was added v1.5.0, Arathi was 1.7.0.

I remember Alatarc was introduced and it was MASSIVELY different, I spent hours farming RTV's and using Mind Control on Korrak to annihilate Alliance players.
---
Good times.
---
Got so sad seeing this I’m a 56 rogue and I’m really new to wow I didn’t know it would be this bad everything you described happened to me on the journey should I reroll or finish to 60 idk I’m kinda not feeling it anymore I really want to play warlock or mage :(
---
its classic. there is server rep. guilds are known on each server, players are known on server. there is community. no one fucking uses shit like wowprogress in classic. we didnt need it. we know both faction players and what theyve done by heart. wowprogress is some retail zoomer shit for people who cant even remember the name of the person they group findered with 10 secs ago
---
equip : need, anything else : greed
---
You'll be outclassed by anyone in raiding gear, it's just better in almost all cases. You can get a few comparable pieces from BG reputations, and the honor vendor if you have enough rank, but not a full set unless you make it to the top ranks in pvp.
---
Warrior or rogue, both are melee DPS but something about Fury seems more interesting to me, i like the rogue archetype and i mainly pve and solo PvP, both have to respec to pve/pvp so in that sense they are the same. I don't mind tanking but I'd rather avoid it if i can.
---
 Completely at a loss of which to play. Honestly Fury is the only DPS i didn't play at max level in vanilla but i like seeing big fast crits and big dps while also being able to PvP without a babysitter
---
r/DunderMifflin
---
Yeah, using any spell instantly breaks MC, but if you target the MC'd player with fort then the cast still goes off as the MC breaks.
---
yeah, before you get bloodthirst or MS youll want to slam when whirlwind is down with a slow 2h for sure
---
using heroic strike costs way more than 15 rage. It costs 15 rage + whatever you would get from your next auto. 
---
ideally use slam immediately after you swing. It resets your timer so if you use it late it can hurt your dps a lot. This right here is the only reason to use a weapn swing timer, as classic is too laggy and has too much melee tolerance to kite and swing. You can do it well without a swing timer too - basically as soon as your guys starts to swing, cast slam. You'll hit your auto as the cast starts and then boom. Another thing is save up enough rage for 2 slams and then cast both back to back right after a normal swing.
---
also for any  fight that lasts longer than 20ish seconds definitely consider to cast sunder armor and forget slam until the enemy is closer to 20% hp, then execute
---
He asked about retail. Can you read?
---
Mara is great yes, i get about 40g/hr with no herb or mining. I would only mine if you have spare time cause of lockout. Mithril is only like 10s each on my server, but mushroom is 1g.
---
A nice moneymaker is selling blackstone ring runs to rogue / warriors. Usually 20g on drop, you will prob have to port them in tho
---
And if it is a 5 man dungeon and they need  a DPS as well they should give him a chance. He will probably be better than most mages that just AOE spam and pull aggro off of the Tank resulting in a wipe.
---
You're paying 82s for avoiding 10-15 *minutes* of travel time.
---
I didnt have DBM for the longest time on classic so I cant see.
---
Its way above 6 though, but the droprate should be between 11-14%
---
damn u jelly. im sure you already know this, but in vanilla/classic people are measured by their rep. the entire server knows who has legendary weapons by name. its a status thing. the pinnacle of vanilla is you/your guild being known by every player. i still remember guild names/player names from vanilla. in retail? i dont know my own guild leaders name. u mad you can never have that lol
---
Hey, I'm on Hydraxion Waterlords too. And I totally understand your social anxiety. I'll spare you the details of my problems, but I too get anxious a lot, in real life and in games. And some days I simply cannot interact with people, at all. And some days I can. 
---
You picked a good server anyway. The majority of folks I've met are nice, patient and helpful. Not everyone obviously. I have met a few twats, but overall it's a nice server.
---
I'm not gonna try and tell you to pull yourself together and just get on with it as I know from experience that's the worst thing anyone can say. It's right there in my list of pet hates when trying to explain MY social anxiety and depression with people. But I will tell you that you've got this. Maybe not right this minute, and maybe not every time you need to be strong. But you can do it my friend. Take small steps. Take your time. 
---
And if you ever need a little assistance, my Night Elf hunter Aerika can help some time. Just drop me a mail and we'll meet up ingame if you are on the alliance side. I don't have any horde characters as yet, but if you're already on the horde side I don't mind starting one to help you out. 😉
---
that would definitely eliminate the hassle, because waiting for 30 mins is tedious, the 2 mins of chit chat is nice and all, but the waiting is a killer.
---
I wish I could bribe a tank, tell me where to find :)
---
Noone does that, though.
---
I'm leveling as Sub as well but with some points in combat for imp backstab and precision. Would you mind sharing your talent tree?
---
Shaman are generally healers everywhere, except the first 40\~ levels or in PvP. You can go down a non-heal route, but just realise you'd be making your life harder for group content. Not as much for dungeons, but definitely raids. 
---
However, Shamans are great healers, with a pretty unique kit for a Healer, what with their Chain Heal and totems. If you don't mind respeccing (which gets expensive) you can definitely rock Elemental in PvP. However Enhancement doesn't work as well there either; you can definitely delete someone if the stars align, but definitely harder than Elemental. 
---
Warlocks on the flipside, are purely DPS (except maybe tanking 1 boss in 1 raid). However they're probably the toughest caster to kill, due to their kit. I don't know much about Warlocks. 
---
However your best bet is to try them both; one may be perfect on paper, but in practice something could be a dealbreaker for you; like you don't actually like having a pet, maybe.
---
Ya'll need to watch Twilight Zone!
---
Thank you! Finally able to get this connected after watching your video and a few trial and error attempts.
---
Ragnaros, you've yee'd your last haw
---
You either price the item to move(just above vendor + deposit) or you know it’s a valuable item and list it at peak server times only. That or stick it in your bank til you know it will be more in demand.
---
Mine is set to I :D
---
Yep and it's just a great idea regardless for a big pull. I don't need my mana so regrowth and rejuv go on, bear form for 10 rage and then usually I'll enrage as well. That plus me getting the initial aggro and thorns means I'm not losing aggro.
---
If you like GW1 you will like classic imo. Grouping while leveling was the best part of that game when it was popping. GW1 was my first mmo, played pretty much all of it, "raiding" PvP.. then switched to WoW. 
---
40 people in a raid killed my fps but it was INSANE to me at the time and still kind of is. 
---
Like you start off 1-10 just kinda grouping with 1 person a few times... Then hit like 15 and can start doing dungeons with 5 people. 10 people at like 56? And 40 at 58
---
Alexa
---
Yeah thought about that, but it's not an instant healthloss unfortunately. The health loss is not that significant and to top it of its a random healthloss. Great item nonetheless
---
Thing is, there aren't a lot of daggers for rogues leveling. I've personally seen a buddy get ignored by a group for needing on hypnotic blade in SM lib.
---
Hope you told him to have fun making friends with that shitty personality.

Levelling a feral druid with a holy priest has made me cocky when it comes to mobs, but STV has other dangers.
---
Sorry.
---
+9 defense on a lvl 40 shoulder?
---
No, he's complaining about people people inviting him after he asks to dps, then tells him he wont get to dps.
---
Mark mobs.
---
1. Mark a caster for your dps to focus on and then spend your time building aggro on everything else.
---
2.  Mark a melee and maul it once, swipe. Once you lose aggro, taunt it and maul again. Just keep switching targets as you go.
---
He had me on ignore already, lol.
---
Yup don’t go rogue tho
---
I don't get why it's so hard to understand that waiting the 3 seconds for the tank to pull and get the initial aggro makes life easier for everybody.
---
spec 5 points into spirit tap on the shadow tree then go full disc until 40 and you have no downtime and unlimited survivability. most dps classes will be able to kill mobs 2x as fast as you but they have tons of downtime low survivability and spend tons on food and drink
---
at least this has been my xp. in 05 i leveled a priest 0-40 all into shadow and had a much harder time than this time where i go all disc.
---
it didn't make sense to me but that is what all the big wigs said to do so i did and its been a blast...PLUS your a spellcleaves wet dream cause you can bubble all day and mages love bubbles lol
---
I can sadly admit I've done this a few times too :(
---
It's one of the most embarrassing things, especially when you've finished a dungeon.
---
I would guess it's also less stressful then ZF farming and who knows the AH situation on his Server. Maybe only a few overpriced Essences.
---
Yea, I did mean taking, my bad.
---
But no, it's not the same thing, notice how the first one is talking about warriors in general and the other is talking about OP in particular?
---
with potions, gems, evocate, mage armor the frozen are surely better than omni as those mana regenerating abilities diminish the effect of int and have a soft synergy with SP, I noticed the same thing but went with Omni just to aboid paying the premium.
---
MC is indeed in BRD, but you cannot get the quest until 55.  Ony attunement will take you all over the world including multiple brs runs.  Easier to just google a guide than to try and explain Ony.
---
That server is super low pop and it’s hilarious that the people of that server who made the mistake to transfer there go out of their way to try to get people there. Heartseeker players sit in the trade channel of stalag all day trying to get people to transfer. Meanwhile, the alliance and grizzly still takes over BRD 3 nights a week while the alliance still cries its a dead server lol.
---
Interesting you say this when you want to relegate at least one third of the game's clases to strictly dungeon farming rather than out in the open world.
---
tbh i do not like the frozen gear as it is all damage and 0 stats. i prefer to use blues with stats and a little less damage but have more life/mana.
---
Grats!
---
Legend
---
lol of course. Gotta love people who shit talk you then put you on ignore because their ego is too fragile to see what you have to say back.
---
I hit lvl 20 with my mate. We are suffering in WC because every time some dumass pulls too many mobs
---
Under your argument why not just need everything? Everything can be converted to gold at a vendor?’so at what gold amount does that distinction take place? And if it is a set gold amount, is that not innately just because you’re more greedy when it involves more gold? Why upgrade at all then? Since you can buy upgrades, why even have a need or greed system at all, just let everyone auto roll every drop and everyone either gets to equip or sell if they win. Take your argument to a different level and you’ll see how stupid it is.
---
Casual is not at all time related.
---
When my girlfriend played WoW she averaged nearly 7 hours a day but she filled that time entirely with pet battles and collecting transmogs to make her gnomes look sillier and her pandas look cuter---Turn in that quest? Nope, there's a cute critter over there that needs to be captured. Do that dungeon? Only if it drops a pet. She never once stepped into a heroic 5 man after nearly a thousand hours in just 3 months, let alone a single mythic+ or raid.
---
Would you say she was anything other than casual?
---
Yes for leveling 1000% it makes it so you can switch between life tap, life drain, dark pact and bandage between mobs and you pretty much never have to stop for downtime.
---
Nifty Stopwatch. Trinket that does the same as sprint on a 30min cd.

Lordaeron under Sylvanas is a military dictatorship from the start. Vanilla/Classic start zone is mostly about eliminating mindless zombies, dangerous wildlife, and Scarlet Crusade. The quests about killing defectors I can remember is the one in Hillsbrad that ask you to kill four well-mannered Lordaeron undead who took dangerous artifacts away from Sylvanas and gave them to Dalaran wizards.
---
ive been killing rag as a tank, and i use bashguuder
---
it's better than mirah's for sure

debuff is great for raid and stacks w/ sunder
---
I feel like 90% of tanks are drama queens or entitled assholes.
---
I was doing Strat UD with a druid tank the other day, and once we're inside they announce "I haven't done this dungeon before" (which is completely fine btw). Once we got the first boss (Baroness) we tell the tank *just tank her where she stands*. The tank ignores chat and tries to LoS her (she didn't know what LoS was, so she just tried to run away).. the baroness runs into a pack of mobs, they get pulled, and we die. No big deal,  just tell her again to "tank her where she stands".
---
She does the exact same thing again, and after wiping a second time we tell them to *please read the chat*. They decide to leave because "we can just find a better tank" even though it's in the middle of the night. Prior to this they said "I don't mind wiping as long as I am learning"
---
The colour only indicates how difficult it will be at your current level, not how much xp it gives. If it gives 5k xp when it’s red it will give 5k xp when it’s green. Grey quests give no xp.
---
&gt; Guy 1 needs on "expensive" sellable item and wins while everyone greeds

&gt; Guy 2 needs on "expensive" sellable item and wins while everyone greeds
---
Yea, you're right, it's really strange how I can't tell the difference between the 2.
---
Find a good spot with humanoid mobs and farm cloth and green items for the next level or two.
---
For leveling i would recommend it since it fastens up your solo mobgrinding 
---
Go with succubus and put the abilities off autocast
---
Ruin is nice but while alone you don‘t use shadowbolt too much anyway
---
You just said no, and then completely agreed with me.
---
People ask for another DPS.  He whispers them and asks to DPS.  They say sure and invite him to DPS.  They see he's a warrior and now all of the sudden they want him to tank instead.
---
It's rude and a complete waste of everybody's time.
---
Warriors are better when they're better equipped.

Rogues are more fun because of stealth antics, especially in WPvP.

That's only after refusing to accept paternity, refusing to pay $125/week in child support, continued to deny publicly that Dememtress was not his child for almost two decades, and then finally meeting with his son shortly after graduation but only to tell him it was too late to have a father-son relationship.
---
Haha nope, a mage, I hit 40 bought and equipped the mount, decided I'm never going to play my mage again and haven't logged in on him since
---
Literally every set of greens in existence has 'of the Eagle' as a suffix. You get ahold of those while leveling.
---
In the 50s Holy Pally and [Caster] Shaman dedicated gear exists and works perfectly fine when you're soloing mobs.
---
So yeah, you can run around in one armor set as a Holy Paladin and do both things without issues, which completely fits OP's concerns.

My wife and I are early 30's, playing since launch. We are loving it. She is digging tailoring and enchanting and I'm leather working and skinning. We just make stuff all day for her to disenchant. She is playing the market and having fun not spending my real life money. ;p She is a priest and I'm a pally, Tank and Spank then two healers for end game. :) If we ever get there
---
You did the yell wrong. Ahem.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH
---
I mean, if thinking any class should be able to single target farm specific mobs for specific items out in the open world makes me a delusional asshole, then I guess you got me there.
---
But hey, whatever fits the narrative of "mages bad!", I guess.

It's statistically improbable that one can ever win the lottery, yet there are lottery winners on the regular.  A low chance of something happening does not mean it won't/can't happen.

roll a mage or rogue
---
primarily mage
---
thier dmg and tool kit is substantially better than a warrior's
---
vanilla is great but it **is not in any way a balanced pvp game**. Some classes have it way easier. 
---
Warriors dont even become viable until you have 2 pocket healers and late-game epics for pvp, and even the, those 2 heals would be better off baby sitting a rogue or mage. 
---
You want 1 warrior for mortal strike and that's it. IIRC back in 2006 there was some tournament and it was all rogues and caster cleave. There was one team in last place w/ a warrior, and the warrior renamed itself to sits in roots after the event.

yep I'm the oppressor. I'm telling her how to play.  listen op  forgot. and when it comes to who has the right to tell her how to play,  its op. they know her as a person and they probably know that if she didn't know the difference,  she wouldn't care.  she's (probably) not going to complain either way so  whats it matter so much to you that her experience is genuine to vanilla? because as i said she's not going to choose addons either way for what she barely understands of the game. if i got my roommate into wow, the first thing id need to do is show him questie and tell him don't even worry about macros, because i know who he is and what would be best for him. don't subject your ideals to me because i know he'd quite out of a too complicated game like this. he doesn't like ds because to him its complicated knowing stats. op knows his mother,  and knows simplicity will get her to appreciate and share something he loves. but i don't have time to tell you this,  in at work. so thanks but that's what the "lack of an adult response" was for

whoooooooosh learn to humor

MCing those friggin wizards in Cathedral and then Arcane Exploding melee packs is best thing ever. Who said priests can't AoE?

You had a good imagination.. don't be ashamed of it!  This is actually pretty awesome :D

i dont think playing 14 hours a day with multiple pocket healers applies to most players

just reroll a mage or rogue and faceroll most classes

She gave birth when she was 13. She may have been 12 when he impregnated her. Who knows how old she was when he first began molesting her.

I'm really sad that there is no glaive throwing weapon (the star things the elves throw in the RTS). Really makes me sad seeing all the sentinels walking around with them :(
---
they get wrecked lol

most of the good players are all mages and rogues because most other classes are obsolete by comparison
---
Ok, this is where I have the issue with googling wow classic info. Cause that is what I did and saw people talking about having stacked in back in Vanilla. That link says no, but it also is to a later version of mend pet. I had to wait to get to a place to test it myself. But in the end- Mend pet is effected by +healing and Arcane shot is also effected by + spell power. Which mean I may actually be able to go build some Cheesy specs for shits and giggles.
---
Well calling all DPS's freeloaders is the dumbest thing on this entire post. But that is another topic.
---
Let me explain this simply... are you ready? Just because someone CAN do something doesn't mean they HAVE TO when they DO HAVE something else to contribute.
---
Your whole attempt at mockery with the Hunter thing is stupid as well because unlike Warriors, Hunters can only perform one role not multiple.
---
Ah yes, caster rdps, I thought it was the melee caster for a second

I got an email about mine on 10/3 I believe.

Is plaid still hipster? Cause classic wow would be the total hipster game haha
---
also all of what you said was opinion. saying you wouldn't subject someone to your game style isnt a fact. many might agrre but that's an opinion. there nothing in quantitative measures you could... measure. ergo opinions

Scarlet Monastery Armory and Cathedral. Good XP, good loot, and time flies by. Still my favorite instances in WoW.
---
9% according to Wowhead. Not too bad. If only I could actually get him to spawn.
---
Same music as Punkrat. Got me so confused. Good video tho, thanks!
---
Hunters not getting the option to throw weapons is bullshit I wish they'd rectified. Troll hunters should be throwing axes/spears, not shooting bows.
---
This happens with alliance all the time. I never get attacked unless they vastly out level me or out number me. Alliance are wimps when it comes to wpvp.
---
Yeah for alliance it’s usually 5 v 1
---
depends what youre trying to kill
---
if your taking on targets in the open world 1 or more lvls above you or that the miss chance makes challenging, youre already playing warrior wrong
---
when that mage is AOE farming 10+ mobs 2 lvls above you, you should be single killing mobs 1 or more lvls below you
---
Bro I’m the same way. 25 warrior. 54 hunter. 35 priest. Now I’m on a 15 mage and I hope this is it D:
---
Your fear and retaliation are on, I think, half hour CDs (fear may be 10 but it’s very long)? So is Shield Wall I think. So this is misleading a bit. You can handle an accidental pull of 4-5 mobs but you can’t do that pull after pull like a mage if the mobs are the same level. And it’s also heavily dependent on the mobs. Trapper mobs that perms trap you? Mobs with disarms? Lots of magic mobs that heal each other or freeze you? You’re fucked. No self cleanse for you mother fucker. Plus your in battle heals are very limited. You can pot once. Healthstone if you have one but that isn’t solo. And then you can bandage maybe. But since your fear doesn’t work on your primary target that then requires stringing, kiting and bandaging somehow. Which won’t happen. I guess you can cancel all your targets first? But it’s not surprising most players won’t get that perfect to bandage. 
---
How and what you can kill like that as a warrior is very situational. Plus you rage generation can be unreliable. It definitely does get better as you level, but you still aren’t comparable to other classes for straight leveling. And to even get close requires lots of additional buffs you can’t actually do on yourself. Saw a level 40 warrior today  running into 4 dark dwarves in Badlands... first instinct was to go assist but knew something was up. Turns out he was buffed to the gills. Even had HP regen going. Which is cool but not actually solo. No matter how much reddit just wants to say git gud. All that and we are ignoring the fact that doing all this requires a) stance dancing and b) swapping gear for maximum efficiency because half this shit requires a shield and your dps without a two-hander is bullshit.
---
Now granted a lot of warriors don’t do the basics, like learning bows or throw for pulling. Using hamstring. But no warrior is out there solo juggling large pulls of equal level mobs pull after pull. You have oh shit buttons to do it if you have to, and that is not the same. Life is still tough out there in classic solo leveling and it’s 100% true that they’re the hardest in the current state of the game, IMO.
---
Is there an addon that is made to specifically show your distance from an enemy, for "Deadzones" and being in-range to shoot?
---
What? I never had room for anything so I had to keep upgrading. How does me stating I did something that anyone at level 50 can do sound elitist?
---
Wtf? It’s a very simple and light hearted question... Having bag space issues, and asking someone how they haven’t had to deal with that is elitist?
---
And who ends a sentence with !? If they’re genuinely being an ass? Or asks a genuine follow up question? Craziness I tell ya.

I'm always out of food lol

Those Elwynn quests were what I had in mind. While the threats definitely needed to be addressed, a lot of the justifications felt a lot like thin excuses to exterminate a whole clan of a “lower” race

Guess that’s just a side effect of mmo gameplay

Two sets of gear. Endurance set and high spell power glass cannon set. Set both in item rack. Now you can acquire both pieces and use them in different situations.

Killing a skull level player is always satisfying.
---
100g now yeah, in the long run so so much more. My mates going to use it though, very rare, and very good weapon for 19 twinks. 
---
First one I’ve had the pleasure of seeing drop.
---
Well for comparison, we've done 4 weeks worth of MC so far. So, it's pretty casual to be reaching MC now... You can do it fresh off at 60. Obviously there are different degrees of "casual", but you're definitely not hardcore if it took you over a month for 60.
---
No, but there is a complex modifier macro for applying various poisons to mh/oh based on the modifiers being pressed.
---
Dark Pact is probably the single best capstone leveling talent in the game. Unlimited mana. Never ever run out.
---
Do you even still have fun playing this game? Or are you just constantly pissed off at every little thing that isn't min/maxed?
---
Sounds more gatekeepy than sincerely inquisitive is my guess
---
Are you insane, just don't play with bad mages, a mage who knows his shit will make dungeons a cake walk, best cc, best aoe, free foodnwater, high damage, sheep and a free org tp when you're done with the run.
---
Do what you enjoy. Feral is a better way to level but if you’re having more fun messing around with specs, trailblazing your own path to 60 or just really enjoy what you’re doing than that is what Classic is all about.

Next time I'll do it right!

I don’t think that’s allowed in the API, someone correct me if I’m wrong, but maybe you could make a WeakAura that shows your range in yards from your target that turns yellow near your deadzone and red inside of it?
---
&gt; so at what gold amount does that distinction take place?
---
Basically any BOE Blue/Purple in a Pug? That's kind of the standard. You can't buy every upgrade. Most BiS is BOP. If a warrior gets BiS BoP plate gear, that is worth WAY more to a warrior than to a mage who could get 3g vendoring it. You have to be willfully ignorant to not see that distinction between BoE and BoP. But BOE's are worth the exact same to everyone. The exact same, the value of that BOE on the AH.
---
Mostly because it’s handy.
---
This makes me ashamed of being swedish, fucking hell
---
Imagine being this entitled. World nodes aren't yours lol
---
warriors are bad at everything that isnt end-game boss dps as fury or PVE raid tanking
---
if you arent a hardcore play that plans on tanking high end raid bosses or being a less interesting rogue w/ slightly more dps, just go with the mage
---
mage is easy as pie to play by comparison as has way more built-in innate power. If youre anywhere below a hardcore player, and want to do dungeons, some lower lvl raids like MC even BWL w/ low responsibility, and have a massive upper hand over all enemy players in the open world, roll mage. There is a reason most streamers/competitive players roll mage or rogue. Far more powerful and forgiving to play a mage.
---
hay man you work 60 hours a week holding a job down and play wow for fun, fuck the rest, enjoy the game and enjoy posting on reddit and ruining real no lifers day LOL get em #triggeredmuhfukas

imagine not being arsed to craft a 200g robe from tailoring and rather roll for a downgrade away from warlocks and paladins

When your the vast minority in a debate good there is a very high chance your wrong....

Yep when you get that level it becomes easy mode
---
and the most delicious one.
---
DPS are freeloaders, though, because tanks and healers DPS as well. But shitty game design means most classes have to pretend to be useful for doing something anyone can do while doing something actually meaningful as well. And, they actually have to NOT do the one thing they're supposedly able to do because they can't tank or heal when they pull aggro.
---
 And, Warriors stop being Obligatory Tanks at Blackrock because that's when the high-damage builds no longer have the durability and threat management to tank, not because their damage is good. It's also when priests stop being Obligatory healers.

I dont follow, are you not familiar how bad this weapon is for pve?
---
i was Half joking. Same bith sides
---
But seriously can people stop attacking like that? I have no idea what kicks rhey get from it. Honor system isnt even active yey
---
The reason you want the axe is because there are a lot of axes that you can get when leveling compared to swords or other weapons. Plus the 5% crit is very solid. After whirlwind axe, the next axe will be Ravenger or Bonebiter. Then more axe options after that.
---
Also every class can pick Herbalism/Mining and/or fishing.

The amount of gold you earn starts to pick up dramatically in the mid 30s.

Actually a typical beer has the equivalent alcohol to a shot, so its equal. But you are right he would need to finish the bottle for every shot

Yes. Is it on this subreddit or a different one? You may be shadowbanned on a specific subreddit
---
&gt; it’s literally prioritizing your gold gain over someone’s best item they can equip in the entire game
---
If a BOE axe drops, and a mage wins the roll, they can buy THEIR BIS gear too! That's how cash works. You exchange it for other goods. A BOE is literally just a pile of gold.  Imagine a canadian, an American, and a Brit are walking together outside and find a pile of American dollars on the ground. Should that money immediately all go to the American, just because it will be most convenient for him to use it, as he won't have to go to a currency exchange? Obviously not, they should split it (or at least have an equal shot at it). 
---
The only reason the Mage in this situation 'needs' the pattern is to save them gold. They'll get the pattern eventually, either by buying it or buy winning a roll for it.

Atleast not in my server which has huge horde majority

Hoping to hit 20 tonight on my Druid and start the Cat form quest.  I work late hours, so my play time is basically like, "How long can I play before sleep takes over?", so I don't tend to make a ton of progress when I play.  Still, though, I'm loving the experience!  I named my character after my first ever WoW main from back in Vanilla, so I've really been diving head first into the nostalgia.

200g robe? On what server? Cost well over 300 if not 400 on incendius. For the mage robe at least.

Horde on Benediction are a different breed. Idk how they even level up, it’s always a higher level skulking in lower level zones ganking people. I rarely see anything but hunters, shaman, and rogues and they quit questing (or whatever the f@!k they do) after 7 pm to roam in packs and screw with low level quest areas.

The point is many casuals aren't at 60 yet.

elementals are great for farming ,which is why so many ppl are doing them in first place.I got lucky i was able to tag at decent rate also got some nice nice gold .Elemental earth sells great ,solid stone sells solid ,and grays you just vendor for good money (oh and if you are miner ,mines respawn around them pretty well)

I mean I played it as a new player 15 years ago and it was good then

Name one? Outside of Ony and MC there is no better.

I’m so with you on the orc stuff. It’s weird because Orc was my favorite race to play in WC3 but I just don’t like their animations and sounds in WoW, I thought I was gonna do Orc Warlock but I went UD for aesthetics.

This. Otherwise, you're a bit of a shit person.
---
Fuckin lightweights
---
there reason people suggest the trinket is bwl has more necks on par w/ the onyxia neck, but you never have good tanking options for a very very long time if ever for trinkets
---
so it's not that the trinket is great, it's that nothing better is there, whereas for necks there are a bunch of options soon after phase 1/2
---
The thing that I am used to is mages opening portals at the end of runs, and instantly dropping group before anyone can use it.
---
&gt;you 2h tank is for Sweeping Strikes
---
i wish an average pug "tank" knew that. They just run around in berserk, pop Deathwish on CD and spin2win full duration every Ravager proc.
---
The OP knows their role... it is DPS they chose that role. Insisting they  are a Tank when they don't want to be makes you entitled. You don't have to take the OP doesn't change the fact you would be entitled (and going by the logic established in this comment thread specifically) asshole.
---
Probably about the same honestly. Almost all of our gear is shared by either rogue or warrior or both. HoJ is hard to get unless you free roll for it since it’s objectively better on warrior/rogue than us (even though it’s still one of our BiS)
---
Seriously hahaha, I can't bring myself to sell any of them
---
Doesnt it level like other skills at 5 points per level, which would make 60
---
Bruh that setup is so clean

Sergra Darkthorn is on a mission to make every beast species in the Barrens endangered, except for giraffes. Stupid long neck horses.

But, they are. I still see people who are reaching 60 now or don't have most pre-bis items as casuals. If you're 40 now sure you're a "filthy" casual, the biggest degree of casual, I guess.

You wouldn’t get experience from the kill

Hahahahahahahaha your making stuff up now? Cause the one your talking about all you see is one guy pass hahahahaha delusional igh pce man your unfixable

That’s about where I was. Try to avoid buying any spell upgrades that aren’t things you actively use. I was getting 5-6g(guessing here) every couple hours of questing, if I’m looting and vendoring everything.  Had my mount at 43.

I 100% agree with you, by the way. I find it way waayyy easier to take a screenshot and crop the shit I don't want out of it in one go. Rather than having to launch a whole other program, alt tab out of WoW, edit and re-save. Or try to remember to do it later. Definitely prefer WinShiftS to print screen. 
---
Also because my 60% keyboard uses sublayers, it's the same amount of buttons pressed for prnscrn and WinShiftS for me.
---
Mage AoE grinding is seriously difficult at low levels, I’d try again at 40 with Ice Barrier and a mount.
---
Ugh. The context makes me dislike it more
---
As a healer, I’ve wanded too many random things in dungeons to count, so I just set Tab to target whatever the tank is targeting and it’s worked wonders.

He did at 12 seconds though he has TSM on which gives an absolutely horrid looking vendor ui

From the night elf starting zone to un goro, each time you die you have a shot or finish a beer. Take it in turns each death :D

Lmao look at this guy with a downtime of at least 5 minutes between each mob.  Pre 40 I will bet money you can't take on 3 mobs at once without retaliation up. Unless you are full twinked out. Also have fun using fear on cooldown, I'm sure you'll never end up just pulling more mobs.

DAE kinda feel like sometimes it would be fun to make a character that is definitively the bad guy? Like, I kinda would have preferred to be a death knight that served the lich King. Kinda like a D&amp;D evil campaign.

Exactly, the guy who sold it to my guild got it from an eternium lockbox.

&gt; What do you think my next dungeon if I were to do a dungeon should be.?

Scholomance for Witchblade. Then do Linken\`s quest chain for offhand.
---
Well not every monitor can flip. Older LCDs usually didn't have that option.
---
Well we actually organized a counter offensive over at dragons call(3:1Horde favored) last night around this time. We got a raid of 12 players together and camped the horde in gadgetzan for an hour. It was glorious. We killed the flight master too only to realize that dude respawns immediately.
---
Did we feel bad about killing lowies. Not really at level 44-50 they have participated or not stopped their homes from camping instance portals atleast once before. So no mercy.
---
I'm an undead, I'm not really good with lungs

what is this classic db thing?

Pretty sure setting focus target is not in classic.

So true. I'm level 43 and getting Mortal Strike with a good weapon &amp; plate has made my life so much better. I WRECK things one on one now. It's like I finally understand why warriors are the tits.  1-40 was brutal without a group though.
---
Honestly, you are right. With the abundance of dungeon runs over this month of Classic, my gear was always up to par, so leveling a Warrior wasn't nearly as inconvenient as I expected. Still harder than most classes, but if someone really has to eat/bandage after every mob, they are definitely doing something wrong.
---
How's it bannable? I don't think corpse camping is against ToS and I don't think there's anything against having separate accounts on each faction. There used to be all kinds of guild drama back in the day with guilds having spies that infiltrated rival horde/alliance guilds
---
don't care why they suggest it.. they are wrong :'D Even Mark of Cthun is worse than ony neck for TPS mate...

please give this guy a Christmas bonus too! to match his new title!

Gonna use the character as an actual alt haha

I love how shit this is its so good
---
depends on what your talent choice is. swipe can generate a lot of rage on crits, often allowing continues swipe spam. Maul can‘t compete with that due to limitations of attack speed.

And if you prep for Aoe, maul threat bonus is overkill anyway

HoJ will be replaced in phase 2 by Dire Maul trinket.

I’m charging for enchanting and some people are pissed. 
---
Kay so the deal is I either disenchant my greens/blues (which means I have a lot less money) or buy all the mats (which are in short supply on my server) AND I have to carry like a dozen different stacks on me depending the ask. Yes I have an enchanting bag, yes it is overflowing into my regular bag space. With stacks of 20 and some recipes calling for *7*, that stack doesn’t last long.
---
I have to EXPLAIN the mats price breakdown sometimes because they think I’m “robbing them”.
---
So, no it’s a lot of work and cash to level enchanting. Fuck off with your “I’ll let you do it for free”.
---
BYO mats doesn’t seem to gather much attention, and tips are infrequent at best.

If you want to finish the quest chain and keep the item, you can destroy the item first, speak with the NPC in Astraanar (the one with 2 pets, forgot the name), she will give you another item, turn the quest in, then go to blizzard site and do item recovery. Did the quest chain and kept the toy :D

Yeah, my Newegg preorder was canceled by them a few days ago. They said they didn’t have enough to fulfill the order.
---
🙄
---
I don’t understand your point? Almost all of your gear is going to be replaced in phase 2
---
That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me
---
Wow thanks alot for the detaild info!
---
So for healing right now you won't respec because resto tree doesn't have anything worth using then or didn't I understand that correctly?
---
But is it worth considering resto tree @60 or you think balance still overshadows the resto tree at higher levels/content for healing?
---
As for leveling, I understand that basically using boomie and feral for a single mob would be inefficient.
---
But this mae me wondering though if leveling goes smoother if I just stay boomie, and when I kill a mob and mana is low I should just go kitty and kill mobs till mana is back again and then switch back to boomie.
---
I was wondering if the above method would be more efficient than just sitting and drinking. 
---
So it would be when low on mana start killing mobs in kitty form and let it regen naturally VS killing nothing but get your mana back faster with drinking water so you can cast as boomie again.
---
Infinite sadness
---
Yeah I think I might need to . I was just told to go get her heating pad for her . Don’t know wether to be happy or not lol
---
Alliance Appendix of Engagement states in 23.f paragraph C: Tauren Fishermen are always Horde spies. When you turn around they will kill you, surprise! Thus they all have to die.
---
So meta, I love it
---
The real question is, would it be quicker to try the tram or not as an undead
---
I'm saying that that talent makes really no difference at all.
---
Giving WF totem to your melees is the biggest dps improvement, having improved weapon totem isn't really necessary.
---
Which blade do you use as main hand?
---
I'd be tired too if I kept replaying the first 20 levels
---
38-40
---
Took me around 3-4 days. Tried to do badlands there were a dozen people camping all the quest spawns. Then got fed-up and left went to STV... that was even worse. There were alot more mobs but there were at least 30 people camping them, and the alliance kept bringing over 60 to wipe us all our while their people killed the mobs for the same quests.  Once I got to 40 and left STV things went aright again.
---
But I lost a good 20 hours /played trying to get from 38-40.
---
The secret is to taunt it first. If that doesn’t work, try sundering the diapers off. All else fails? Just charge it. Try to resist the baby’s incessant psychic screaming. It’s basically the only offensive ability they have besides Spit Poison and Noxious Gas Cloud. Keep your wits about you, and don’t cast Berserker’s Rage no matter what you do. We were all noobs once.
---
With the PvP system, kills that are more than 9 levels under you (grey) aren’t counted as either honourable kills or dishonourable kills, right ? They’re simply just a.. kill ? Couldn’t seem to find any info clarifying this when i searched around. Thanks
---
&gt; Guy 1 needs on "expensive" sellable item and wins while everyone no one else does
---
&gt;Guy 2 needs on "expensive" sellable item and wins while everyone no one else does
---
Doesn't change a thing, but are you happy now?
---
Well you would owe me money then. You don’t need retaliation up to pull multiple mobs just need it for oh shit situations. 3 mobs is doable without dying even without retaliation.
---
And this is why i love wow 🤣🤣
---
Earth elementals have alot of high price vendor trash along with the occasional essence of earth and chunk of ore/stone used in crafting.
---
Roaming deathballs of players will likely be the 'ganking' norm in P2
---
Never knew about that until the other week. Crazy shit I've leveled there is many times must of just avoided it
---
I was supposed to say shot haha, it'll be a fresh character so you won't have it :D try it mate
---
Well now I want to reroll.
---
I think that it completely depends on how you are playing. If you are throwing all 4 dots onto every target then yeah it's probably worth it, if you're just casting 2 dots on everything then I think your points would be better elsewhere.
---
what are these posts?  legit cant tell if you guys are trolling or what.
---
Been doing alright. Got to level 36 in the first two weeks and got completely burnt out. Been playing off and on again for a few hours at a time, focusing more on playing the auction house rather than levelling.
---
Rogue isn’t hard even without a main/gear, you’ve got stealth to skip mobs, and vanish is a relatively low cooldown get out of jail free card.
---
I am assuming it's not possible to adjust this with an Addon, or else it would almost be compulsory.
---
Hunters don't need dungeons for gear. There\`s like 1 bow for lvl 19 in WC, quest reward pants from Gnomeregan and then almost nothing until Maraudon.
---
Incendius has a great population and balance.
---
You're missing the part where they never agreed to him dpsing.
---
Just choose one of the five endgame ones and you should be okay, they all have good loot for mages.  
---
Scholo - Freezing robes/gloves (till you get better), belt from Kirintos is good if you haven't got the ogre one from BRD, Bonecreeper Stylus wand/Meteor dagger from Gandling  
---
Stratholme Live - Star of Mysteria from final boss and Hearthsinger drops Magister's boots (Kinda meh)  
---
Stratholme Dead - Crimson Felt Hat, Seal of Rivendare is decent  
---
LBRS - Trindlehaven staff is good if you don't have dagger+offhand, Skyshroud pants also drop from one of the early bosses, you also get the Eye of the Beast quest by looting the final boss from here    
---
UBRS - Briarwood Reed from Jed is BiS till P4, few other decent drops too.  
---
&gt; I was also thinking about farming for my archrobe not really sure where to start farming earth essence water air?
---
The rumblers in Silithis are great for Earth since you gain Hydraxx reputation with them and can be easily AoE farmed.
---
Water is a bit trickier if you're frost, but the ones in Felwood are commonly farmed.
---
As for Air, there are some elementals in Silithis that also give Hydraxx rep, but they're a bit harder to kill since they're ranged.
---
Yeah, I an going to take a page out of OP's book and stop replying to this Huntard who like to contradict themself and not read what OP is saying.
---
NE starting area is brutal for new players. That giant tree frustrated the crap out of my daughter because she couldn't find vendor or trainers... As opposed to say the Tauren starting area where it's a row of huts.
---
A fellow razorgore patron I see, how are you finding the server?
---
cuz the first 5 gives 1% and the last 7 gives 0.28%
---
Whatever you find the most entertaining :)
---
Yeah I let her pick the character and she chose NE so I just bit my tongue. Hoped she would’ve went with a human .
---
Already got inventors focal sword, and the offhand your talking about
---
I played forsaken from vanilla all through WotLK and I was totally down with all the forsaken quests. Testing posions, plagues and all kinds of nasty evil stuff, only to culminate in the Wrathgate even in Wrath. Loved it. I "lived and breahted" for Sylvanas and her Apothecaries. I am not 100% up to date on all the new lore regarding Sylvanas, but I am sad that she's become the main villain. If I were playing retail I'd totally want to be on her side as a forsaken. Screw the horde. Give us a third playable faction xD
---
yepp
---
Why would you use those gloves with daggers when Aged-core Leather Gloves exist?
---
Humans will only use those gloves with axes.
---
That’s great to hear. I went with a human if only for the mace/sword racial.
---
Depends if belly big full or small full, Big full many man small full 1man. Ogre not so dumb now huh?
---
Dude thanks so much this comment helped and basically answered my question
---
and they are very close for mitigation as well.
---
Razorgore represent :D
---
Good work! What was your path to gold farm?
---
I usually play casters in RPG's, so this time for classic I decided to try something completely different and rolled a warrior. It has been a miserable experience so far and much of it is due to the toxicity of the classic WoW community (Hear me out),
---
I never got to play WoW classic, so all of this end game content is new to me. I was in one of the first batches of players to hit 60, and start tanking end game instances. Right out of the gate, many of these decade long veterans that ran these instances 10,0000 times had absolutely no patience for my noobness.
---
One time a person got testy with me for pulling a pack of mobs we didn't necessarily have to pull. I was not kind to this person.
---
But the one I hate the most is when DPS do not like your pace and so they take it upon themselves to go pull for you in an effort to speed up the instance clear. This leads to no initial charge rage, and no mobs hitting me to build additional rage. Now I'm trying to build threat/rage with just AA's while there is nothing but sheer chaos in our camp. I've gotten to the point where when this happens I just pretend I'm AFK and let them die.
---
Also, I can't tell you how many times I pleaded with the group to give me a few seconds to build threat before they AoE or unload their combos. Quite often they will listen to you, but by the 2nd or 3rd pull after mentioning it, they have already reverted back to their old ways. I pull the group with a bow, then look over to my left, and there's that warrior next to me already spamming his whirlwind when all I have for threat is a few AA's due to not being able to use charge unlike the DPS warriors who can charge because they aren't pulling.
---
Ok, sorry, rant over. I rolled a hunter and mage and I'm enjoying those two classes.
---
An actual good tank can completely negate the penalties caused by bad dps.
---
Just picked up a back piece called tigerstrike mantle and was wondering the same thing! Haha same for a shield called redbeard crest. Is there a good website for that info?
---
just go 30/0/21. you can heal everything very well, destroy every alliance you face right now and still grind somewhat efficiently, devilsaur is no problem at all. resto spec is only really needed for aq onward, maybe also in the first weeks of bwl for progression depending on how good your guild is.
---
This is the one change I wish would happen. I feel so useless in tight spaces, sfk was rough.
---
Unless you go herbalism.  I finally gave up and turned clutter down around lvl 45.
---
No, pretty sure that's the part you're missing.
---
I don't know, Windsor sort of had this badass stride to him, not to mention that I recall him being able to sort of hold his own in combat.  The background story he had was pretty cool too.
---
Yea, the trolls in eastern arathi highlands were a really good spot. High cloth drop rate, mostly silk, a little wool and even a chance at some mageweave. But greens seemed to drop all of the time. I killed them for 4 levels. At 40 they should still give you some xp as well.
---
Edit meant to reply to you're reply but I guess I hit the wrong spot on my screen
---
Wadding through the pile of bodies was fun. Hip deep in chunked horde.
---
It’s worth pointing out that if it takes someone 9 days /played to reach 60, those hitting 60 just now have been playing for 5 1/2 hours a day.  Even at 6 days played (99% of casuals aren’t doing this), it’s a little under 4 hours a day.  
---
I mean ultimately you’re free to define casual in your head however you’d like, just pointing out that the players you’d consider “casual” would be judged by the general public as playing the game for a (perhaps borderline, maybe,) unhealthy amount of time.
---
Edit: and I’ve been 60 for weeks, I’ve got no investment in this personally.
---
Is that a dead ferret on her arm?
---
Rammage? Like Kevin Ramage from American Dad?
---
https://youtu.be/aAnQS1PvL5A
---
Lol if not have a laugh at this anyways!
---
Fun idea. Good job.
---
Is it really? 1% spell crit
---
Correct. They are the same as all kills currently are. No reward or punishment in game.
---
You gonna replace t1 set with DM blues?
---
I think that guy just killed you...
---
Wowhead says the droprate for eye is indeed around 3%. I thought I remembered it being less than 1% but I guess I was looking at something else.
---
Ah, night elf, she is gonna love that music for life.
---
The name calling makes you sound extremely biased.
---
A scrunchie . Apparently they’re making a comeback.
---
okay but that's a sea turtle.  they're not slow :(
---
Another option is the SM grind. It's what I did 31 to 41 or so
---
Target any mob and you can press f-f to target the tank and then the tanks target.
---
Oh God... the rage that game induced...
---
It’s really not. His guildie sent it, he might not even be a redditor.
---
What’s easier, opening snap chat and taking a pic and easily sharing or as a non redditor, taking a print screen, pasting it into paint, cropping it, uploading it to some website and then sharing it.
---
It's like goblin mail on Runescape.
---
Oh look, drunkards. 
---
Next.

Parishealton

Where do you get average ping 40ms? I play on fiber internet and its always at 90ms no matter the time of the day.
---
She’s currently level 3 , about 1/2 the way in . Unwillingly killing boars and nighsabers for a quest .
---
L2English mutherfucker.
---
they do the most banging sausage rolls
---
Are you one of those people under some delusion that because you didnt play retail you are somehow better or more intelligent that those who have or still do?
---
News flash:   you're not.
---
Pretty cool, but probably better off finding a Warlock that needs the SW ones and duo it
---
I've always thought that bounties would be an awesome same PvP system (same as well as opposing faction) to have in classic WoW. But rather than expand on world PvP in expansions, they moved further and further from it
---
They are upset because they want me to play the game in a way so it can benefit them?
---
Weird as hell
---
It’s not, it’s a perfectly acceptable alternative to witchblade
---
Maul is much less rage efficient since you dont gen rage for the maul swing.
---
It is but that's not what he's trying to do
---
Wrong. It dropped for us in upper spire from a level 62 elite
---
Hmm I'm not sure what the Orc kick crit animation is, I checked on the WoWhead dressing room but didn't see an option for "Kick crits" just "kick" I've never seen an Orc do a backflip so my gut instinct says they don't, but if you find a gif or video of the animations shoot it over it'd be cool to see what they do -- I love the gnome backflip kick haha
---
Marking every enemy is a great tip. It gives the group direction, and there is a paper trail if anyone ignores your commands and your group fucks up. 
---
The blame is immediately shifted from you, to the hunter using multi-shot and gaining aggro on one add and un-sheeping another.
---
you need an item to reach executus on mc, when phase 2 arrives if you are revered with hydraxx you get an item that doesn't depletes when you use it (you have to run for like 30 minutes every time you run mc just to get the item that only has 1 charge)
---
Just a little fun RP with the guild :D
---
Pot trying to call the kettle black there eh dumbass?
---
The homer effects and the “sorting out with your mate” was fucking hillarious
---
Thought it was a 30m cd
---
Do you play 10 minutes a week? Damn the ratio of money spent / minutes played with that monthly sub must be through the roof.
---
Kill some boars in EPL
---
Intimidating shout - bandage yourself - kill rogue? Also, rogues are just good at bursting down someone wearing greens if they pop their cooldowns.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Ohhh I was thinking that if you couldn't drink anymore you'd have to take a shit lmao. Trying this next weekend possibly.
---
Alright so I have a 60 arms warrior with epic mount, 8/8 valor and lots of BiS stuff. I 2h tank with dreadforge retaliator and crusader enchant on it. I have solo tanked UBRS with a 9 man group. I top dps meters while holding agro. And it feels great.
---
But now I have a 47 frost mage and I'm seeing things from the other side. I can confidently say that as a frost mage, I can solo many of same level packs or at least single target mobs. You don't have to hold agro on every single mob. Let us kite and kill while you tank the rest. Less damage on you, less mana wasted for the healer and faster pulls. It's really not a hard game especially if we're talking about 5 man content, so don't sweat it if a ranged wants to solo kite a mob. Do your thing and don't sweat it.
---
Father! Is it over?
---
Was it, or was it not, the default range.
---
You should have Enchantrix installed with it. I believe this one gives that information.
---
yes i did, is making shit up for humor not allowed mister cut and paste, you taking something literally is a sign of mental illness, and no i didn't make that up.
---
Oh I see, mail agi for the hunter. I thought LW has their own system that makes mail made more towards ago for shamans and hunters. I've never done classic LW or BS so I'm no expert sorry! I'd checkout LW mail patterns on wowhead classic to find LV 50-60 gear. Once you get into MC you'll be replacing a bunch of stuff anyways I think. Devilsaur stuff is top notch as far as I know.
---
I would suggest red ridge mountains. Then the moment you feel comfortable start questing in duskwood. I’m a level 44 lock now and duskwood was the most fun I’ve had questing in classic by far.
---
Nothing wrong with that! I think the highest number of runs I did of a single dungeon before my 50’s was two. I did the same as you, collecting all my quests and then doing them all in one go and finishing the rest of my levels by questing elsewhere. Much more fun IMO than the constant dungeon grinding.
---
I would try it but I would end up dying irl lmao
---
I'm a 42 year old bald man so I feel like that just means we have something in common. Now I'm even more interested.
---
Note: This is for the hybrid Ele/Resto build I use. If you're full resto tree the math is slightly different because your free resto talent point can go into another tree.
---
Using their default Resto points system you get this
---
https://i.imgur.com/qCvnzzG.png
---
For future note: R4 Healing wave heals ~660hp/150mp(4.4hp/mp), R1 chain 1575hp/260mp (6.0hp/mp).
---
Using their point system, the most reasonable "downgrades" to get the set effect are this:
---
3 Set: https://i.imgur.com/CcAmBhR.png
---
The three piece set has only a very minor benefit (1 resto tree talent point), but also comes at the lowest cost. You lose 70 healing power, and gain 4mp5 + some int. By their cost system, that's roughly the equivalent of a net loss of 30 spell power. Most likely you'll be grabbing -1% manacost for healing. Since we're so mana limited, I feel it's fair to simply translate that to +1% total healing done during a long encounter.
---
Even in an optimal scenario of min rank casting spells to abuse spellpower, that takes us from 600&gt;606 "effective healing per spell" which would only cost us 7 healing power to achieve. A net loss of 23 according to their point system after we account for MP5/int gains. 
---
5 Set: https://i.imgur.com/34IxbCe.png
---
This set has the most potential it would seem, but comes at a hefty price. We're now down 116 points, and the impact of our 1% manacost reduction is even smaller due to less total healing power. The mana savings from this one sum up to 9.75% if we include the extra.
---
We get 565 healed on R4 wave turned into an effective 620 healed. A pretty big gain, but still falling short of our 660 benchmark.
---
8 Set: https://i.imgur.com/wW3uIT7.png
---
I think, even if you question their point valuing a bit, we can agree that the 8 piece set gives up far too much healing power considering it only gives a benefit to our single target heals. It also doesn't make them stronger, but turns them into mini chain heals. So we've weakened what our single target heals are supposed to do, to turn them into a mini chain heal.
---
The additional heals are 20% and 4% for an effective increase of 24% effective healing. Our heals are much smaller though, starting at 493 and being multiplied by our extra 24% stronger heals and 9.75% better mana bumps us up to 670 effective healing. But we lose single target focus. 
---
This forces us to start making comparisons to chain heal instead of healing wave. And that's when this set blows the chunks. Going from 660&gt;670 effective healing only pushes the hp/mp up to 4.46. No where near the chain heal mana efficiency of 6.0hp/mp. We also lose a chunk of MP5.
---
~~~
---
Conclusion is that the set effects are never worthwhile. In all but the 8 piece they lose to the reference point of R4 healing wave. In set 8 the multi target nature forces a comparison to chain heal which is notorious for its mana efficiency and makes it immediately lose out.
---
Caveat of course, this is simplistic math. I discarded the concept of crit and overhealing. I only used a single reference point and didn't check the rank 7 single target which empowers the 9.75% mana cost reduction *somewhat*.
---
But yeah, other than the helmet the T1 shammy set blows.
---
Of course. I always provide people with Mage services in my GROUP.
---
Maybe not a native English speaker
---
Ye usually do this for other things, such as addon bugging or so, but in this case I didn't think straight. Thanks though :)
---
that's the charm of wpvp. sometimes you get dicked, but once in a while you get to dick someone back, and it makes it all worth it.
---
I don't think the guy losing his mind is Swedish, he is calling the the other guy Swedish as am insult my guess he is Danish or an Arab.
---
It rocks
---
So I just need to get good then.
---
I can work with that, thanks.
---
Forgot to leave a comment.
---
He took an hour and helped 4 of us lvl 36s with arathi badges and all the elite quests. Hes a lvl 60  rogue and a god amongst men
---
I ran into a mage farming there. He was nice and let me group to get my quest items. Took 3 kills and I was in my way.
---
Okay cool thanks im a noob so im going to ask a couple dumb questions here. How exactly does lockout work? How can I properly reset instance? And when selling runs would I have them tag along with me till it drops? Or start looking for people when the ring has dropped.
---
Dragons controlling world economy, more like.
---
K I’m new to wow and playing a lock. I think I’m doing ok but what are characteristics of a “bad” warlock so I can know if I’m doing something wrong?
---
Where are this unicorns ? Because all I ever get is ungrateful childish solo player minded mages
---
Oh, is westfall quicker than from darkshore?
---
Hadn't considered that route...
---
Complete lists are on every website that offer tutorials, walkthroughs, or guides for WoW.
---
Did this yesterday trying to get my guildie to UC from ORG. Whoops.
---
err I meant push, not click
---
Alternatively: standard action bars, raid frames of choice, and mouseover macros.
---
Coupled with elvui, which the newest update has healcomms, works perfect. But I've personally never enjoyed the click to heal addons.
---
You might be right and makes more sense. I’ll change it.
---
You just snip it with Win+Shift+S and then paste it, that’s it. At least try it out man before saying it takes more time. You don’t need paint, or to upload it somewhere since like 2015
---
I'm really happy to see people doing this and just letting their partner explore. Really think that's the best way for someone to get into games
---
+8192
---
No but I can imagine “the gold it sells for is a hell of a lot more useful than putting it on”.
---
So, just basically an average hunter then.
---
Tank classes have taunt

---
I remember in vanilla I won chromatic carapace like this from another Hunter who I also remember distinctly being an asshole. Such a sweet moment.
---
I haven't checked in a few weeks but kromcrush was like 55 45 or something. Hordes favor
---
Yeah I would help people with their quest if they needed.
---
N O   C H A N G E S
---
That makes zero sense because I never called anyone names so you are only furthering your display of ignorance
---
1 devilsaur leather, 15g haha.
---
Ally camp in Un'Goro lol
---
I agree.
---
However WHAT I'M SAYING is the windfury damage bonus to four warriors combined with your own damage is equivalent to what a fury warrior would do that would replace you.
---
Nope, people just don’t like assholes, which you obviously are.
---
Jeez 100 runs? I've already seen a couple hunters in 8/8T1 or 6/8T1 2/8T2 in my server and it's one of the newer ones. Is it even worth the trouble for pre raid bis? I figured people were just skipping it in favour of the raids.
---
Usually most guilds 'sponsor' whoever gets it. In other words they need to be involved in the guild community.
---
No its the mindset of the rules blizzard put out on ninja looting
---
Paste it to what? If i’m sharing it with a bunch of friends, snap is way easier.
---
I mean I use gyazo for screenshots and it’s easy as shit. But Snapchat is even easier.
---
Would I rather upload it and share a link or directly send it on snap to a bunch of friends or a group chat? It’s way easier with snap.
---
I've never once used it but I'm on a PvE server. Does anyone know if it's useful against any mobs? I'm already at lvl 52 and haven't found a mob it's useful on.
---
Once again, it depends who you ask. Old people think 5 hours/day is a lot (even if they spend that much time or more watching TV) but in the gaming world 5 hours/day would generally be considered normal/casual, especially for an MMORPG.
---
Who said I didnt play retail. All im saying is 99% of redditors are idiots and that includes you.
---
My most recent arena/anger run, we get a replacement dps after the last guy left, but I figure why not start clearing. Cleared to anger, and backtracked to complete arena before he made it in.  At least he had the one chance at the trinket, but kinda felt bad all that work for one mob kill.  Woulda been okay had not everyone felt like breaking after that one.
---
But also uhhhh, dont die like 5 times on the way in if you can help it.
---
I lost the Mageblade 6 times now. Once to a 58 Mage and today to a  fucking Warlock with a Level34 Belt + Seal of Wrynn (~lvl25) ...what the fuck? I'm 60 for more than a fucking month already!
---
Truth.
---
&gt; how bad this weapon is for pve?
---
Please link a better phase 1 upgrade. Keep in mind BRE automatically goes to warriors, so that's out of the question for Paladins. Shamans can't use swords as well. If you're about to link Nightfall then I've already debunked that in a previous reply. No spammable abilities = poor uptime on the debuff.
---
If only you understood why this post was made. - It's because many of them aren't doing their basic functions.
---
18 days pure time in game and im still lvl 56 :D i think im super casual =/
---
RemindMe! 5 days
---
That is totally ninja looting. While agreements beforehand are nice, the need/greed system is built in by default. If someone is needing on everything they're just stealing from the party. I give people one warning right up front if a need looks suspicious, and if they do it again they get booted. They also get booted if they give me attitude about the warning, because that's just evidence they've had this argument once before.
---
Should only use rank 1 Frost Nova.... Ever....
---
This guy gets it
---
I mean... Just look around at the Undercity... we've decorated it with skulls..
---
I have to agree... the rule is need when you need, greed when it’s not an immediate upgrade. Sometimes I’ll ask the group if the item is better than what I have and for the most part people who are inclined to answer are pretty honest. Any other ideas should be discussed before the player in question rolls, not before the entire instance begins. Also, if it’s an upgrade for one class but a BiS for another, then I yield it to that class. That’s my own personal rule (and I think a lot of others would do the same) - ymmv with that though. 
---
Example: the gem for LBRS dropped, I asked if I could need. Everyone said nope, so I greeded. Pretty simple. 
---
Another example: boots drop and I’m a priest. They’re better than what I have but BiS for a mage. I would yield the item to the mage if they needed.
---
That is a sacrifice I'm willing to make!
---
Point is, it will be an upgrade for some people.  So why should they be prevented from rolling if the leader says for anyone interested to /roll?
---
If the rules were laid out upfront, no one has the right to complain.
---
I don't think its dead, i think its a normal server. I was really looking for a slower pace compared to skeram tbh.
---
Oh bless your heart.

I started a guild on a regular pvp server and the 20 dudes I've recruited have been RPing it pretty hard and its been a great time, everytime I log in I have to spend like 15 minutes replying to letters they have written me about their travels and initiates theyve found for us and it's been an absolute blast, I'm not sure if they're just RP dudes or the guild name brings it out but I've been getting into it too and its cool
---
WinShiftS is literally part of your OS.
---
Isnt the only resemblance the hair color and bangs?
---
thought it was spelled “sense”
---
You're not missing out it's not good
---
Correct again. I’ll change that as well.
---
I think those are the only two exceptions, but it’s just for one race/class combo.
---
I personally like classicdb better because it only has classic wow (except for the comments which it pulls from wowhead which can be 2.0+
---
The golden rule of questing in vanilla:
---
**Just because a quest is available to you doesn’t mean you should do it yet.**
---
Lmfao I'm sorry, since when is taking something literally a sign of mental illness? Why did you take that so seriously?
---
Grow some thicker skin you big whiny baby.
---
1. Balance is a meme spec. Respec to feral, prioritizing cat DPS talents, it will be 10x better. Stranglethorn Vale is a good place to level for a lvl 30 druid, since many quests there reward you with good leather gear. And if you\`re on PvP server - PvP is better when you have stealth and can choose your fights.
---
2. There is a goblin at the shore in Tanaris who sells high level fish recipes.
---
3. Try your server\`s discord, maybe?
---
4. If you don't like it - why roll on PvP server?
---
Fishstack is a honest worker and deserves a promotion!
---
And then 2 seconds after this screenshot was taken, Mor'Ladim ran up and smacked you dead.
---
As a priest running around, I'll stop healing injured characters unless they tip me.
---
I hope you meant Duskwood
---
Human character are just so meh:)
---
LOL underrated comment.
---
I've been playing 3 characters and managed to get them all above 20.
---
FriendsInfo is a great addon and one I use frequently. It allows you to people notes in the tool tips of anything - alliance, horde, mobs, etc.
---
looks like elvui
---
It has to be some casters with shields and buffs, if you hit them and you get frozen or something like that, try It.
---
Rogues own warriors until level 50ish iirc.  I leveled a rogue in vanilla and I stopped trying to kill warriors somewhere around 50+.
---
This brings a smile to my face and warms my heart. Good for you guys.
---
I thought it was BIS for pallys and Shamans until Naxx
---
Sounds nice. :)
---
If I'm looking for a specific kind of guild (casual, willing to help each other out for dungeons/quests/etc.) where should I go? I'm alliance on Thunderfury
---
You're right, I should have said "insult to nature".
---
What addon is that, that makes your character portraits and everything have a black outline? Also class colors in the name background?
---
Hit lvl33 and got kinda bored with uni starting and less time for games. It's gonna have to wait until winter break for me to get to 40. I don't mind. Playing Classic brought back a lot of memories and made me appreciate what we had then and made me appreciate what we have now in the way of MMOs. Wow Classic isn't easy or fun a lot of times, but that's why I decided to give it a try.
---
I did 4 dungeons all in all. I understand it's fun to have to plan and try and make groups and so on, but I'm a bit older now and 1-2 hours isn't doable unless it's Saturday. Finding a good guild is much harder too. In the end...I grew up to enjoy the games we have now and I thank Blizz for making it possible to experience what we had then.
---
You’re right, and mages shouldn’t give anyone water, and locks shouldn’t soulstone.
---
I don’t see those stupid healers farming soul shards!
---
Crusader easily
---
Why would we need a review of a town?
---
For the 20somethings that I know that play video games (myself included), 5 hours a day, on average, would be considered a lot.  Definitely not unheard of, at all, but people would assume that you were neglecting other aspects of your life to get that play time in.
---
A lock should never be at 100% hp especially because demon armor makes you regenerate hp in combat. By being at 100% hp you don’t get any advantage of that regeneration and siphon life if used.
---
It doesn't work very well at all in vanilla; devs didn't really think players would use it as much as they ended up using it.
---
Like others said, get Auctionator / Auctioneer, that's how you make sorting work.
---
Separate horde/alliance queue times maybe
---
The group wouldn’t have access to a soulstone without a lock to make it, that doesn’t mean he still shouldn’t put it on the healer.
---
Never go full retard
---
How the fuck is that possible... And I am sitting here doing strat ud for the 20th time to get a damn crossbow...
---
I work 6AM - 4:30PM Monday through Friday and Just hit 48 this morning. The end of leveling is finally in sight for me. I’ve gotten to the point where I can start trying to collect some pre-bis items, and I purchased deepfury bracers off the auction house even though I’m two levels away from equipping it. I want to get the devilsaur set, but on my server the set is now 450g total, and devilsaur leather costs 20g a pop, so i’m going to be saving quite a while for this stuff and might just not get them at all and hope for the best. 
---
I remember loving Searing Gorge when I played in vanilla, so I made the trek through redrige, burning steppes and blackrock mountain to get there... only to be killed within 2 minutes of entering Searing Gorge by a level 60. And then killed about once every 2 minutes by level 60’s until I got to the flight path and left. It was awesome. Didn’t even pick up any of the quests and will probably never go back. Getting fucked on by horde 12 levels higher than me for an hour makes me want to sit in Stonetalon Mountains and kill every lowbie horde I lay eyes on, but that would only perpetuate the issue of people only engaging in PVP to be assholes.
---
That is a ninja, but a big chunk of the community has pushed around a broken argument that any good player sells BoEs and bad players don't deserve them.
---
Weapon skill doesn't matter in pvp
---
I play about 2-4 hours a night and I am level 50. That includes taking around 8 24 hour breaks from the game since launch.
---
I\`d go with Crusader - dead enemies don\`t deal damage.
---
The lock didn’t have to go hours out of his way to level up a skill no one expects him to have. 
---
You’re fine if a rogue cant open it. You’d kick a lock if theybsaid they can’t summon.
---
I had my worst experience of this yesterday in Uldaman. A Fury spec was one of our DPS and kept grabbing aggro off of the Sword and Board tank. They kept claiming all they were doing was auto-attack but I'm pretty sure they were getting greedy and using other abilities that generate threat. Our healer was a Paladin and couldn't sustain heals on both Warriors. They really should have just let the Fury spec die.
---
Movement with one hand...
---
Can confirm. Bright was terrible.
---
You can reset 5 times pr hour so you need to learn to do rotgrip, tinkerer and princess in 12 mins for most gold / hr for best efficiency
---
Resetting with a friend: he has pt leader, you log off inside instance. He presses reset instances. You log back in and will start where using the scepter teleport puts you. Solo you need help to get a bank alt into a pt with Main char. After a run you switch to alt and pt leader will autoassign to you after 2mins
---
Yeah, i would practice some hours first since princess/rotgrip will probably kill you :D If they are 60 warrior or 48 stealthed rogue they can pass all mobs and Just chill in the princess area, then when it drops they trade you 20g and you master loot the ring to them.
---
I seriously gave up on the earth elementals and just farmed the Coyotes and mountain lions. Then moved in to the dragon welps.
---
Was making about 10g/hr from vendor Greys and skinning to make nightscape tunics to vendor. 
---
Earlier in the day I was killing maybe 3 elementals every 10 minutes because of other people farming
---
Fuck all that noise
---
Guessing here but I’d say the less downtime from lifesteal would be more efficient questing. Not gonna do the math here but I’d guess the extra attack power wouldn’t reduce kill time enough to make it more efficient. Seems like a better enchant for raids than questing.
---
It is literally still grinding dude. Whatever
---
He's Trolling you Mate, He can't prove that claim because he's making it up.
---
there are generally multiple spots to level. if you are ever stuck you can do /who 20 (or whatever level you are) see what zones people are questing in. other option is just google.
---
Hmm, greedy (((dragons))) owning all the banks. Wonder what they meant by this?
---
Hell, I'm a shaman and I'm seriously considering filling out a tanking gear set because I'm tired of waiting for tanks. I have a shield and Rockbiter Weapon, come at me mobs. :P
---
Fishstack makes a good point
---
r/tooktoomuch
---
Gonna have to agree with you. My warrior is decently geared, not quite twink level but close but 3-4 mobs would be death most of the time even with hamstring kiting and such(which tbh is not even worth doing most of the time because of the leeway mechanics). I can nearly one shot them all, but you cant do the damage fast enough because of how heroic strike/cleave works and no real way to do damage outside of that and overpower procs
---
The problem is that most Warriors are idiots and don't want to tank because they haven't fucking read up on what do do. I often times have to fucking tell Warriors how to tank. They often don't use Shouts or even tab-target. They just charge a Mob and cast sunder-armor on it and ignore the rest.
---
If you meant Duskwood, there is a chance you will meet Stiches while autorun
---
Would your answer change in the context of PvP or PvE?
---
There would have to be some serious herb dumps for the market to not be flooded
---
Again, I'm calling those quests with horrible drop rates grinding. You are literally grinding for a drop. A quest drop.
---
Please, Horde people! Give enemy Priests a chance! When they approach you and ask for “wait, hug, pat” - maybe they want just mindControl you for a buff! Dont be scaried :( I mean, u dont loose slot even if its agro, so why loose nice social opportunity to interact :O   
---
PS yes, i like to buff Horde cows alot :C the are cute and every player deserve a help on their journey.    
---
PPS u can kill me after, if u are super agro. But let be buff before =/
---
Got 2 earth essences after 150 kills, cmon.
---
Dudes got bants. I'm fucking proud of him.
---
Imagine thinking archmage robes only cost 200g lmao... Nice dead server you play.
---
Yeah he wielded Ironfoe before Thaurissan stole it from him.
---
I have a lvl 24 and a lvl 19 and now a new char lvl 9. i literally started when the servers went live
---
Warlocks pull insane ammounts of aggro. If you play warlock on horde you are kind of screwed since you cant get blessing of salvation. The art of playing a decent warlock is to know when you pull aggro and wait for the tank to safely secure aggro before you start dropping hellfire.
---
The shittier the gear, the higher you roll. Duh
---
I doubt anyone is going to drop 1k on a pet this early in the game. I had mine for 2 weeks on a high pop server before it ended up selling for 150g.
---
What about name plates?
---
didn't go to silithus. 0/10
---
Just shy of 40 and I've been bingeing on the weekends and after work way more than I should with adult responsibilities. I do spend a lot of time on WPVP and really inefficient questing though. If you asked my wife/friends, they would definitely say I play too much. Casual is sorta like saying your middle class - people have very different interpretations of it depending on the people around them.
---
Try getting as far as you can on your onyxia access as you will have to complete multiple dungeon quests in it.
---
Same lol
---
definitely. ive been able to make 10g/hr minimum from fishing since lvl 20. pm me if you have any other questions on fishing in classic and ill be glad to help
---
Every mage I know ports my group out and gives everyone food/water, including me and I don't ever need either.
---
Play with cooler players.
---
Un'goro? Not the gates of AQ?
---
I had this happen with an item from a lockbox.
---
You need to put more spell power into it.
---
Well think about it. Every body who played this same game as “vanilla” were new players to world of Warcraft too. So take it as a new adventure and just have fun with it. Learning the game will come in time just as it did with everybody else in 2004. Find yourself a good helpful guild that will help you out. Don’t be afraid to ask “nooby” questions. You have to learn somehow. Also, as another comment mentioned you may have to try out a few classes before you find what you like because none of these classes will play nearly the same as they do in BfA
---
Ship the greens to an alt and disenchant them. Enchanting materials will pretty much always be in demand
---
It's also important to gauge how adept your group is-- if the mage/aoe can kite and not die, go ham on pulls and use yourself to pull/group mobs and taunt save when needed. If they are not as good, mark/cc real tank.
---
I dont care to be honest, I always go with the flow. I always mark the mobs and if dps is taking aggro of me I dont mind, I just focus to have my healer clear and do the best I can. If shit get out of hand I will talk and if they dont understand I walk, pretty simple so dont sweat over it.
---
Nice, i had an AR in classic and took a lot of my resources too. I think this time round I'll just wait for spinal reaper since i'm with a solid raiding guild. Same art
---
I hate casual players I think they should be embarassed
---
&gt; This. Otherwise, you're a ~~bit of a~~ shit person.
---
https://youtu.be/XIRh31AQQNo
---
Dont tell anyone. It's a secret.
---
If you like variety, play druid! You can heal, tank, and dps all in one character without having to respec while leveling.
---
This reminds of when I rolled a 1 on Fel Heart Shoulders and the other 3 Locks didn't roll because it wasn't BiS. 
---
Well When I go out to WPvP and farm for Felcloth, These shoulder's really helpful in fights against the horde.
---
This has happened to me several times. I honestly do not understand why they don't buff.
---
Turn off furious howl auto cast so he uses growl and bite more
---
33 is not the same as 27 btw, one of them is higher by 8
---
because a guild is consistent and eventually everyone will be geared. every week theres slightly less competition for drops.
---
We’ve thrown crusader on this one!
---
Kek
---
With this logic you should pay for healing unless you want to corpse run for 3 minutes.
---
Yes it’s 18g for the training and 72g for the mount at honored rep.
---
Mages can teleport themselves or create a portal to Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus (Alliance) or Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Undercity (Horde).
---
Teleport just takes the Mage to the place, Portal can be used by anyone in the Mage's party. OP wanted a portal to Ironforge, but the Mage teleported instead.
---
Auctionator classic
---
You can rotate by just holding right click
---
You should cross out engineering right fucking now and learn the iron grenade hussle!
---
Dearhbringers mainhand with edgemasters is going to be significantly better than ironfoe.
---
What?
---
It's to cast falling fridge ice &amp; tasty snow cone on trash and snowball on bosses.
---
it says toxic horrors have 9 % drop chance while EPL has 3 %? I can see why hes farming them and earning so much /per hour
---
gtfo with this shit
---
You have my sub.
---
Oh yeah, my bad.  I tend to call both those zones darkshore.  Cuz they're dark.
---
I played horde for like 10 years, alright?  lol
---
One thing I picked up on pretty quick was that the zone level thing just means that a quest can be picked up by someone of that level. Whether that means they can complete that quest is another story. So much of the game is designed around group content that often those level numbers are arbitrary, so I tend to play 5 levels ahead just to feel as if I'm achieving things instead of corpse running.
---
Player name: Mustardtiger
---
Straight to the top with you
---
Nearly all specs are viable in some cases, it just so happens you’ve picked the weakest spec out of all classes.
---
In regards to cooking recipes, you probably won’t bump into them until you reach higher level zones.
---
I understand the sentiment to level quickly and I won’t ever tell someone they’re playing the game wrong, but leveling is half the experience and sometimes you need to slow down and enjoy the little things.
---
ITT: people who don't actually play Horde. Yikes.
---
you got the whole addon pack uploaded on my discord: [https://discord.gg/amvfA7j](https://discord.gg/amvfA7j)
---
So, i just completed 36 runs without sight of any of the swords, truestrike, scale or other good items. I cant say that I had the usual run. For starters when truestrike shoulders didnt drop, both rogues and hunter left the group instantly. Second we killed Jed and two mages and warlock left without seeing the reed.  
---
At this point I was pretty damn pissed already, but I just had rend left so I wanted to continue, after finding new people, waiting 30min for them to get there and getting ganked by alliance.. we finally got to rend.  
---
You can imagine my surprise when both of the swords dropped at same time.
---
One in a hundred?
---
If only.  The problem is that fighting turns into each side just rezzing while picking the other off.  It slows everyone down in busy zones like this.  So usually horde gets one side and alliance the other.  
---
If anyone picks a fight, they alone get killed and camped for the rest of the night.   Otherwise, it spirals out of control and nobody gets anything done for an hour
---
Because the point of the game isn't to be the most efficient. Some people, like me, don't give a single flying fuck if it's not 100%. It's not that we are creating more work, we are choosing to spend our time how we want to enjoy playing the game. Sometimes just chilling and farming mats is fun since it's relaxing.
---
*"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."*
---
That Is what ops talking about. Hes complaining as if this shit is a common occurrence. It isnt.
---
free-fishing is easy to do alongside something else, i just turn up the splash sound so i can click+recast in the game with barely any thought. fishing up schools can be comfy but nowhere near as afk
---
You know how fun it is shitting all over someone in one or two hits? Real fun
---
Edgemasters are currently best in slot even for humans, with Deathbringer and flurry axe.
---
nice
---
Luckily there are other mages who aren’t as stingy when it comes to just pressing a button
---
Yes, and it's hilarious watching him slaughter the oblivious
---
Dropped today, didn't roll (bid) on it as a Warlock because you can't have an off-hand like the skull with it.
---
thats exactly what i do
---
The best advice you could have given her was to roll Horde! 😉 Glad to see she's enjoying WoW.
---
balance has very poor mana efficiancy and its dps isnt to great either honestly.  and no classic is not well balanced. at all.  feral levels really well and is one of the most efficiant leveling specs.  your much better off doing feral for leveling and pvp and switching to resto for raids at cap, balance in classic is a meme spec
---
[Some guy](https://youtu.be/baax2zfrdFg) has even measured the ramp's usefulness for speedrunning.
---
When AoE is being used I use Aoe. In the case with the tank, it was 2 mobs. 2 regular old, nothing special mobs. I dont just sit there spamming frost bolt when there are 20mobs on a big pull. When its necessary I use it.
---
There are a few cold immunes you will experience in this game so just be aware of that. I don't recommend it at all, but at least get scorch or something you can use when you do need to fight an immune. You also need it for later phases in the game, you're really not even saving much gold for the possible trade off.
---
Being a huntard and telling someone how to play their character, you go pew pew thats it, you have no options in that department
---
You're so retarded it's painful to read,  take a break lmbo
---
Where are you farming the essence?
---
This reddit is mostly tanks and healers whining about not getting the respect they want. The reality is that a decent group should definitly pull fast and skip when appropriate. If i see my healer has enough mana i will pull another group when the current one is about to die, if i run with alot of mages and warlocks i will double or triplepull. If the casters are almost out of mana i will kill the current pack and wait for out of combat, but once everyone sits down and starts drinking i will get to the next pull since they can continue drinking until i positioned the mobs. Sometimes you get groups where the dps or healers want to pause and drink after almost every pull and complain if you pull while they are drinking and almost full. Its incredibly frustrating to just stand around and wait for no reason and good groups should have minimal downtime.
---
I didnt say he was lying. I said hes vastly overstating the problem, which he is. And I dont know why u people all think I havent been in any pvp, i said i havebt been in any massive hundreds on hundreds but i have been in big battles with no issues. I didnt count them but I'd say it was prob like 100 total or so. And yes I'm sure the servers will just be inundated with 500 on 500 battles all the time.
---
Imagine being butthurt about an MMORPG **intended** behavior.
---
Never tell me the odds
---
LISTEN FUCKING SHIIT
---
You had me in the first half!
---
Did you report it in game or on the forums?
---
Yes, you can? It's not hard, it's just a 200 hour time sink.
---
Same as in we’ve both been playing since launch
---
Did you not read his post?
---
Don’t let them get away from your blades whatever you do. Ignore their pet.
---
Gotta love that retail attitude.  Yea, nothing left for me this run, I’m out.  Seriously that shits worse than dealing with a loot ninja.
---
Sleep 7 hours, play 5 hours, what are you neglecting exactly with the other 12 hours? lol
---
In the case with the tank that was mad I didnt AoE, it was 2 regular mobs, nothing special. and he wanted me to aoe, lot of mana just for 2 mobs lol. And I never said it makes me good, my play style is different than others. IM mediocre at best. But I do my job, as a mage. If the tank and heals want big dick AoE, I give it to them, if they want normal dungeon run, I give it to them.
---
&gt;Why is it a meme spec? I’d need some elaboration in regards to that. Surely all specs are sort of viable in some form or another.
---
No, unfortunately some specs are just bad. The game was new back then and design team made some mistakes. Balance druid spec is, probably, the worst offender. Only in Burning Crusade they made Balance viable. In Classic, Balance is just a bad version of frostmage - less damage, less mobility and constantly out of mana.   
---
&gt; Tanaris I haven’t been there yet but I don’t think it’s an easy place to get to. 
---
Both your leveling and cooking are high for lvl 31, so if you want to keep progressing - you need to look for recipes in higher-lvl zones.
---
&gt; but sometimes it’s just like why do it 
---
because they can.
---
For the people that leave when their desired loot doesn’t drop they should really be put on a blacklist just for being a douche
---
WoW became so popular because vanilla WoW was very good for new players.
---
Isn't this just a screenshot of STV?
---
Forsaken have always been evil and doing horrible shit. Thrall kept them on a loose leash, and then Wrathgate happens, and Sylvanas plays dumb
---
So not only did both drop, but you got both. Well played friend
---
This comment makes me laugh at people who argued that orc rogues are better than undead for pvp.
---
Yeah but if you're ganked i don't see you getting close at all and of course i ignore their pets.
---
Because most groups don't have a bear tank. The bad locks will lifetap and then just stand there.. after the healer just drank expensive water to get to full mana. Not eating, not bandaging, nothing. And then they don't use drain life. They expect the healer to burn mana on healing them.
---
I farmed sm gy solo
---
Great job I loved this
---
Sub’s armor ignore is worse against warriors than it is against any other class besides Druid.
---
that was sorta my line of thinking but i dont really like that every spec still has a melee component to it.
---
Really though, there are a ton of potential tanks for leveling. A competent group should be fine as long as it’s not all clothies (unless it’s 4mage 1priest, the best dungeon comp)
---
I’m not talking about the default range. I’m talking about the ability to have them set to 40 yards.
---
You're IQ is beyondé limited.
---
Ayyyy What server You On? What Faction? Witchhunting might be against sub rules, but Corpse-Camping Aint, Cupcake :3
---
It was an insane amount of mobs. We would pull 4-5, which was planned and doable. Then 2-3 would die, and the Rogue would pull 2-3 more. We, at points, would have 8 mobs on us when I was oom. He would continue to do this even when I was out of mana. To give you a better idea, the Rogue pulled adds with the Cath boss, and the Warlock that was with us basically Life Tapped himself to death. But that's my fault, apparently. I only stayed because the Paladin and the Warrior (who kept pulling aggro, bless his soul) were cool people. The Rogue and Warlock were being assholes.
---
Fury warrior is one of the best dps in the game lmao
---
One in a hundred
---
Exactly, 1 hour to get there, and another to run it
---
Ele shaman rocks though, who needs enhance.
---
Big spender I see
---
You may be right, but do you have to be such a dick about it?
---
That's why I sighed relief before I killed the mage and the escort barely survived with a really low amount of health. I couldn't fear, I already put rend on the guy so idk if it would fall off like it does with NPCs
---
Badlands.
---
Feralas doesn't make much sense, either. Apparently I need to eradicate that ogre tribe that's giving us trouble, so I need to kill 10 ogre shamans.. but the place is filled with warlocks and battle lords or whatever they are, which don't need to be killed.
---
There has been plenty of those on the "LookingforGroup" channel.

I have had much better groups from trade or general chat in Orgrimmar.

Max box requires 225, so you only need level 45.

I'm not sure what you even mean by get rid of it, if you mean not have it on your skill bar that's just up to you. All I'm saying is you need to have a way to deal fire or arcane damage. Especially if you ever get into pvp and the mage counter-spells you and prevents you from even using frost spells, then you will be really screwed if you don't have anything on your bar to deal damage since you'll be silenced from frost for awhile.

Hello, me again! 😋
---
I'm what you would call an MMO veteran. I've played a LOT of them over the years, some really seriously (raiding, crafting, house building etc), but not WoW.
---
I first played WoW a few months before the 3rd expansion Cataclysm was released. I was fortunate to have a friend show me the sights of Azeroth. He guided me through "vanilla" and expansions 1 and 2, happy to relive his time again, and we had a brilliant time! 
---
By then the game was already overwhelming and it was incredibly daunting, but he made it palatable for me. It was a lot to take in. The game had been improved a lot by then with quality of life stuff like a group finder and cross-server play. It was very different to the original vanilla experience so I was told.
---
Then the Cataclysm happened. The entire game was changed. The whole world! Zones were ripped asunder! Floods &amp; earthquakes all caused by a bloody great dragon tearing everything apart!
---
I felt robbed. This world that players had been in for 6 years I had barely experienced at all, and now virtually everything was changed. I didn't stay long. I went scurrying back to an older MMO that I knew better.
---
I did try WoW again a few years later, but it was even more daunting than before. I found it just too much to take in. It's not uncommon in MMOs. Expansions come out, the older ones get forgotten about. It's even possible to skip that grind to endgame and make a character at a higher level. 
---
Anyway I'm waffling, sorry 🤪
---
Classic is where it all began. It's not perfect. Sometimes you run out of quests in a zone and have to grind up for a bit. The quests aren't all handed to you as you enter a new area. Some in fact are hard to locate or complete. Nothing is handed to you, you work for it. Its challenging and rewarding. Gold is hard to earn, but satisfying when you finally do. Saving 90 gold to get your first mount at level 40 is a real challenge! 
---
So yeah. Classic is harder, but in my opinion much more rewarding to play. It sure is for me anyway.
---
Which trinket from the hinterlands?
---
Will of the Forsaken is stupidly broken for PvP.
---
Oh well, I guess you could manually type in the tanks name lol
---
You can do what you want obviously, just saying I see where he's coming from.
---
*honk*
---
It equates to about 1% hit.
---
Nope just don't take BiS for a temporary upgrade. Anyone who raids or isn't a garbage newb would agree.
---
And the face and eyes she just looks like felicity jones
---
Vanish is such bullshit in PvP. Especially now without CC trinket (yet).
---
If you have the same luck as me it’s worth 5g
---
Why stop at Un Goro?  Surely you would want to take it all the way to the AQ Gates.
---
Both. Warriors are great all around, I would say tank is probably going to be more gear dependent though
---
Can't wait for portal to Stonard trolling. And then v2.0, portal to Dalaran (old).
---
Why you gotta do Dazzling Longsword like that?
---
Huh. That’s a pretty nice leveling helm. Weird that it wouldn’t sell.
---
Break the cycle.
---
Well then they will just have to accept queues
---
I'll probably level my engineering and make grenades to counter there slows on me and then pop sprint to close the gap.
---
My HOTW and Rebirth costs reagents so I'm definitely going to be charging for that now.
---
Women are people, dude, not another species.
---
find a semi-casual guild and see what\`s needed. Maybe you can secure an offtank position.
---
Pattern alone is 300-400g on Mankirk

---
i.e.  
---
If you have a problem with a group while tanking, that could have just been a crappy party.  If you have problems with every group you tank for, you are the problem.
---
Keybinds stay the same. It does have a much easier way to set your keybinds though, when active hovering over the spot you can hit a ley and that makes it the hotkey for that slot. And the binds are stored on battle.net so you won’t have to re-set them even if you play on multiple computers or change addons.
---
in raids you only need 2 (maybe 3) tanks. need a lot of dps though. tip would be to find a guild and discuss with them what is needed.
---
I just /wave. 
---
I move on after a gank cause i don’t have time to pvp since my younger brother is beating me in leveling. 
---
It’s just sad too cause it’s usually a skull level alliance. I’m not saying you’re all wimps but your gankers are.
---
Get any mob, then hit f twice it switches to the targeted player (tank) than the one he's actually attacking. That's how I make sure I'm assisting instead of aggro pulling
---
I farmed my gold as a priest from 38 to 40 skinning beasts in Swamp of Sorrow. AH only Heavy Leathers, everything else to vendor. Spam some SM cath, vendor everthing and 40+ quest zones should make you enough gold. Also sell in AH bolts of silk cloth if you are tailorer.
---
I dunno... It was definitely watchable. Most cinema films coming out now are a solid 5/6 outta 10 and bright definitely fits into that category.
---
So basically, if you like any recent film, you'll like bright.
---
Battlegrounds will be filled via your battlegroup, not just your single server, so no, there is no BG queue benefit to being outnumbered 3-1 on your server.
---
Lmao I needed this. Thanks buddy.
---
&gt; prices especially at this point of the game fluctuate a lot
---
vendor prices dont..............
---
I'm on Grobbulus and it's alliance who are doing it here :/
---
Can I dual wield a Dagger and 1 handed axe as a level 26 shaman?
---
And this is to go even further beyond!
---
I tried WoW a few times over the years because I always wanted that “real” WoW experience. But I never had other friends who played and it didn’t seem right, so the furthest I ever got was maybe level 30 around MoP. So I really didn’t know what to expect going into classic, and was probably in a similar position. With all that being said, my answer is this:
---
Do it. Just go for it. It’s crazy fun, and when it gets hard, that’s just a chance for it to get more fun. Or not! You can always stick with green quests and mobs for a smoother time. The game has lots to offer however you want to play. You can just jump in and have fun.
---
Wot? How long ago was this? Distinctly remember having a personal sized bottle circa 2014
---
That's ninja shit. Fuck that dude.
---
A desire to make gold is literally what GREED is.
