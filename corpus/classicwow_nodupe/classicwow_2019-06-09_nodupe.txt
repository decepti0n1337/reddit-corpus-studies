I am going to try to keep my professions relavent to my level, although maybe levels to where I am making the appropriate level gear. I sort of rushed the first go round, I think I will just play the game this time. If I feel like working on a prof ill work on it at whatever level I am at that time.
---
It is stupidly strong on arms PvE (slow hits, very high damage), but arms is not the optimal spec to begin with, and most serious guilds likely wont allow it anyway.
---
Some of this may not be accurate as it is based on private servers (sit Crit thing it talks about), but good info here.

keep in mind using charge won't guarantee a mob is yours, damage is the only thing that makes a mob yours. charge only stuns and does no damage. Intercept will give you a mob tag though as it does minimal damage.
---
 I can't help you with macros unfortunately.

Don't forget food delivery apps.  Grubhub, Doordash, Uber Eats, etc.  You'll have to sacrifice a minute or two to answer the door, grab the food and get it back to your desk, but well worth it.
---
&gt;intentionally overbuffed everything to be harder for more of a challenge.
---
And yet everytime some crazy record is made on a pserver people say pservers are easy and classic will be harder ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You are assuming private server proc rates are 100% correct on BRE despite proc rates being one of the important things pserver devs never had true access to.  
---
If BRE ends up having very low proc chances, then it might not even be BiS pre BWL.
---
I'm not sure if you're exaggerating or if you actually think they're 100% identical. While they do all fall under the phenethylamine class, there are certainly chemical differences.
---
I've mained only DPS characters (mage, hunter) so I plan on going healer. Rolling dwarf priest this time around.
---
I mean, are we arguing effectiveness here?  Because warriors can do some very high damage with it and prot warriors will be the MTs.
---
20 hours a day of not knowing Vanilla leveling and questing well vs. people who know if like the back of their hand is completely different. 0 chance they take world 1st MC, or even close to it.
---
Meh you're entitled to you're own opinion I guess but from my experience on a certain Private server I can definitely say that all of the awesome community aspects that we remember fondly were all in tact even with the ridiculous 10k+ server population. 
---
I see no reason as to why classic would be any different especially when the amount of players on each server will be at least half meaning that you all stick out as individuals that little bit more.
---
I think most people will be picking three names on a single server. I could be wrong though.
---
    /#showtooltip Charge
---
    /targetenemy [noharm]
---
    /cast Charge
---
    /startattack
---
That will target the nearest enemy and do the rest. If you already have an enemy targeted, it won't switch targets.
---
Next level advanced species use [this](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/192843905854-0-1/s-l1000.jpg).
---
I think he's doing his job. Hyping up release and providing classic content for the masses. Also organising big raids for PvP probably provides plenty of testing data for the devs.
---
Very nice.
---
You can it‚Äôs just not very good because the good talents like MS and SS work best with a slow 2 hander.
---
You need a shit load of hit rating which makes it better to just use a 2h.
---
You can see invis from same raid group, but not in vanill
---
/r/imverysmart ?
---
More assumptions that the BRE proc chance on private servers is accurate, despite knowing that is one of the many things they never had access to.  
---
If BRE ends up not being BiS till naxx40 like they are on all pservers, then sulfuras is going to be BiS until cthun.  
---
Keep in mind that BRE also had a very low drop chance.  I saw one drop in 8 months of clearing MC, and the guy replaced it in BWL (who knows if it was the right thing to do or not).
---
You're in luck! Warriors just so happen to be the best tanks AND the best melee dps ;)
---
I also don't believe that everyone will be reserving names on August 12th. It's an extra $7 just to do it and some people just don't care.
---
sure sure.... \*puts in 3 weeks leave\*

---
Basically this. With so much time invested in forming the group people are sorta forced to be more patient/polite so all that time isn't completely wasted. I think LFR/LFD is an actual case of you think you do but you don't because they look so good on paper.
---
Night elf models are player models therefore WAY more detailed than npc models, like the high elves, and back then there werent custom models for important characters
---
He is on the latest EU time zone, and he makes it clear he is more of a semi casual player at most.
---
How would he have the time to form and lead a raid?
---
Your mortal strike hits for a bit less. You have to work around not putting points in 2h spec (not much of a problem). 
---
It‚Äôs pretty reasonable in your 20s and 30s, especially if you want to keep your 1h skill current for ad-hoc tanking. If you think you won‚Äôt have help getting Cyclonian down, it‚Äôs viable. 
---
Still, you might be better off adding points to Fury after 17-18 in Arms, if you‚Äôre studiously avoiding 2h weapons.

Being honored gives you 10% reduction and being rank3 pvp gives you another 10%. Exalted doesn't give you 20%.
---
well, hamstring kiting doesn't really work with dual wielding. Your rage generation will be lower because you don't hit nearly as much without hit gear. The overpower procs you get on hamstring dodges will be much weaker. You will be more likely to proc an overpower while overpower is already on cooldown, wasting it. Sweeping strikes, when you get it, will wear off quicker and be less impactful. Similarly, cleave will cost more and do less.  Mortal strike will be weaker but on the same cooldown and same rage cost. two handed weapon specialization will not be useful for you. When you proc deep wounds off non autoattack damage (hamstring crits) it will be less impactful.
---
but I think heroic strike is slightly more powerful?
---
Agreed, but having some of these analytics will be better than having none. Otherwise its just a shot in the dark.

That's actually good to hear, less macros. But what about mouseover petattack so at least we can ez pop some totems?
---
I third this
---
If you remember, do you know exactly how much experience you had left to gain before 60, because this would be amazing for a group of horde to all walk in ding and then raid the city!
---
I was in the same boat. I started in Vanilla not knowing anything, and still didn't know shit for another year into BC. I was slotting mp5 gems on my hunter so I could grind more mobs to skin.
---
And that God damn Cenarion Emissary Blackhoof that keeps asking me to box
---
Congratulations, you managed to string together 168 words into an incoherent mess that could have more easily been said in less than 10:
---
*Classic should replicate Vanilla as much as possible*.
---
And then we'd just be laughing at you for saying the sky is blue instead of laughing at you for trying to sound smart.
---
&gt; Dual wield fury maybe
---
Maybe? DW fury is one of the best specs in the game.
---
You said it was normally used for node and mob farming. That's what I was commenting on.   Leveling as a multiboxer is actually going to be a fair bit slower on classic. Only kill quests will have an advantage but there are plenty of collection quests that will slow it down. But aside from that, plenty will still be doing it quite well.
---
It's very possible that each region will only have one realm for every type of server. And then you won't have any choosing to do anyway.
---
It‚Äôs not dumb, on a very populated server launch it‚Äôs nice to find something else to do.
---
Why not both? Just play druid.
---
I like the cut of this guy's jib.
---
Since it's a holy damage how can it be resisted? Thought there is no holy resist in game. Are you talking about 1% unavoidable chance to be resisted?
---
in 45 minutes you should be level 5 so no very effective
---
I mean for vanilla it‚Äôs not that bad
---
No way man. There's 130k people subbed to this subreddit alone. There will be dozens of servers at launch for each region.
---
Red Bull‚Äôs  and pretzels
---
Is this for Cata though? I looked at the troll starting zone but it‚Äôs not the same as in Vanilla
---
I don't want to deal with the possibility of people not wanting to deal with druid tanks.  I'd rather play a warrior to tank.
---
I do. I needed 5 xp to level Stormwind exploration gave 8 xp
---
Warlocks weren't that popular back in vanilla, and that was before anyone considered possible counters.   Highly doubt people are keeping that in mind in mass.
---

Nothing could go wrong literally. I could change password via e-mail which he has no acces to. Mobile authenticator etc.
---
Sadly retail AV is usually a 20 min BG just like the rest of them. :(
---
There's alot of stuff like that in vanilla. Some classes' specs just sucked.
---
Well, except for Paladins, those bastards are like a boss out of Sekiro, you have to kill them 3 times over before they stay dead lol.
---
Druids are easier to tank with than warriors, they aren‚Äôt nearly as gear dependent. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre talking about a prot Paladin here, Druids are actually viable.
---
With the exception of Hunter the numbers match what we've come to expect from private servers. I think Hunter numbers will be similarly high if not higher when classic launches, as it has always been popular among casual players. Other than that I expect the ratio to be the same, but perhaps with more Night Elves.
---
One of the interesting trends from retail vanilla to private servers and now WoW classic is the huge decline in the number of Night Elves. In vanilla they were neck and neck with Humans as the most played race in the game (together they comprised about 46% of all created characters from 10-60, including Horde and Alliance), but their numbers have dropped off massively in the private server scene and the numbers look worse when you consider that they're the only Alliance race which has access to Druids. I expect those numbers to rebound by quite a bit when the casual playerbase gets access to Classic. Well that's what I hope at least. Dwarf females were once an incredible rarity but they've become the hipster's choice right now, and Gnomes have become much more popular (because of their respective racials of course). Classic will lose a little bit of charm if the Alliance is inundated with shorties.
---
And thats pretty easy to do when the starting zone isnt flooded and dynamic spawns are happening, so how would that be accomplished if the #nochanges crowd has their way and dynamic spawns arent a thing on launch?
---
This made me chuckle.
---
What‚Äôs your time zone? I will be leading a ‚Äúone‚Äù-raid-a-week guild with official raids on Tuesdays, and optional Saturday night raids. Guild will ultimately decide times, but like 8-9 PM Central start is most likely. Lmk!
---
First Aid, as melee it's important. 
---
Also, there's basically two main quest paths (orc/troll/tauren or undead) through the game. If you're struggling with quests getting too hard following the path you started with you can travel to the equivalent zone for the other path and quest a bit there to catch up. You might find yourself doing the majority of both quest lines, allowing you to skip the tougher/group quests.
---
What a journey. Thanks for sharing.
---
I honestly forgot photobucket existed. Holy cow.
---
That's why it doesn't make sense to be hyped for beta, let alone resub just for a _chance_ to get in. Your progress won't carry over, so it's essentially the same as playing on a limited private server with slightly different numbers. The skeptic in me suspects there's some Blizzard astrosurfing going on this sub in an effort to drive up current subscription numbers, surely people can't be this stupid...
---
/2 LF warrior tank
---
I used to make my poor younger brother wake up 3 times a night to farm this fucking thing and get the server first. It ended up being so awful but the experience getting it was so fun.
---
We are both 30 years old now and he still bitches about it lol
---
The slow weapon is a concept I never quite understood.
---
Faster hits less but more often. Doesn't comes at the same thing in the end?
---
You can't front shred in classic haha. That's a shitty private server meme
---
Second most upvoted post of all time in this sub! Well deserved. This is both very creative but must also have been so incredibly difficult to pull off. This is amazing! These obsurd things is what Classic will be all about. &lt;3
---
You've got the right mindset, OP. I got in, and honestly, you get a deep feeling of impermanence, but I've done bits of everything to help ensure things aren't broken, and I've rolled 6 characters on both Alliance and Horde, levelled most of them to 10, a couple to 13/14... and really, I don't want to level further, because I know there's no point. I've logged more than a few bugs though (don't worry, minor stuff, most probably known anyway).  
---
On the plus side, everything is as good as I remember from Vanilla. Things are on the right path.
---
Dynamic spawns were a thing across the entire world in vanilla
---
&gt; People will just be glad to have a tank.
---
Thats fair.  As I has no interest or experience with druid tanking until midway through BC, what kind of gear is available to druids for tanking for 5 mans/preraid?
---
Does hit rating not apply the same way to 1handers? Sorry I'm just trying to understand.
---
Same problem,
---
Tank:
---
Leader of dungeons
---
Always have decent gear from dungeons
---
Movement can be tricky and fun
---
......
---
Have to be more "on" while playing
---
Have to deal with stupid pulls
---
Stinks when you are the lowest level in the group, extra squishy
---
Healer:
---
Sit back and Netflix while casting heals in a good group
---
Downranking is tricky and fun
---
More spots in a raid available
---
Useful in AV
---
Have to compete with mages, warlocks, shamen, priests, druids for cloth intellect gear
---
Kind of boring in tank and spank fights
---
Have to drink a lot
---
do the starter zone quests with random people. they dont require looting an item. it's just get kills. once you're done with those you should hit about level 3 and then just move on find level 3 mobs and grind a little. early levels grinding doesnt take very long.
---
u right
---
My ex still laughs about those legs every time.
---
Honestly don't mind pruning but what they are doing now is gutting to force players to spend more time doing the exact same thing over and over. It's not difficult or interesting just bland and boring I'd rather do kill quests than end game BFA.
---
This is very true. The staff from the WC quests is a huge dps upgrade from what you'll have and imo worth taking over the 1h sword.
---
Very insightful thank you.
---
Don't be afraid to use Staves, and don't be afraid to put I spirit gear. Spirit makes hp Regen faster too, not just mana. So if you find any of the Stat+Star greens and it's got spirit on it, don't fee like it's no good for you. Every bit adds up and cuts down on time spent eating or bandaging.
---
I'm beyond humbled to be the 2nd most up voted post on here. I'm so excited for classic with you all. FOR THE HORDE
---
No... they werent.  They had a very different calculation than the approach pservers took.
---
One could easily write a book on the influence of player behavior and trends on WoW's design. Gear catch up honestly isnt the issue - vanilla WoW had gear catch up mechanics. Expanding the pool of players to draw from for content completion benefits everyone. 
---
The erosion of social cooperation and roleplay elements, power scaling and homogenization of gear, homogenizing class abilities and the current talent table, the neutering of professions, vertical expansion philosophy (could write a doctorate thesis on this alone), and sharding all rank higher and should be redesigned by Blizzard. At this point we should be looking at WoW 2.
---
Is that 340 from gear?
---
Well there's plenty of evidence for OP's conclusion. Take a look at this subreddit, private servers, or twitch chats for starters.
---
Based on /r/wow subscribers and actual BFA subscription speculation, there's not much evidence to support this subreddit is only a fraction of the population that will play WoW Classic, but let's assume you're correct and that WoW Classic will have 1 million players on launch.
---
There are currently 48 region and server-type combinations in Retail WoW, so we need at least 48 servers for you to have more than one to choose from. Except most of the extra server/region combinations are in China, so unless you live in China, that number is much less. 
---
There are at least 3.5k to 5k players per layer and at least 2 layers per continent.
---
@ 2 layers per continent, that's 17k players per server or ~59 servers.
---
@ 3 layers per continent, that's 25.5k players per server or ~39 servers.
---
@ 4 layers per continent, that's 34k players per server or just ~29 servers.
---
Blizzard plans to use layering to reduce the need for additional servers in anticipation of the population leveling out after launch.
---
It is more likely that you will have one server to choose from than it is that you will have too many to care about.
---
This isn't 2007 where Blizzard needed 500 realms.
---
They ought to offer it to people. Whether you can't control yourself shouldn't have to be our problem :/
---
&gt; Call customer support or a support ticket on their website.
---
I can't, it won't let me contact customer support without uploading ID, when i upload ID from a completely different region they are just going to lock me out
---
No, because instant attacks are like a free swing. The slower your weapon the more you benefit from the free swings.
---
That's true of white damage, but special attacks such as mortal strike scale off weapon damage rather than damage per second. Since these special attacks are usually restricted by a cooldown a faster weapon won't help you there.
---
\&gt;read the title
---
I see no problem here
---
Unfortunately, I don't remember. I did a quick look on Curse and I can't find anything similar.
---
I bought sword traing during the stress test at level 6 or 7.
---
They definitely were, both mark keen and Kevin Jordan have commented on it on stream
---
You don't make flasks with silverbloom and earthroot.
---
Not really. I don't know why people make this "No Warlocks on Alliance becuz WotF" argument. Publically available level 60 class distribution on private servers has something like a ~1% discrepancy between Horde and Alliance Warlock populations, just as with several other classes.
---
When you get your Copper Battleaxe, you want to replace that at level 14 when you turn in the Ragefire quest from Thrall, to get your Axe of Orgrimmar. Which will last you for a bit longer, until you can get a dungeon drop or the Staff reward from the WC quest if you're not picking up the sword for tanking.
---
It's about those talents being an instant cast that does a certain % of weapon damage.
---
 In six seconds if you swing a 2sec 4damage weapon you do three attacks for 12 damage plus one instant cast for 100% of wep damage. Your total would be 16 damage.
---
If you swing a 3 sec 6 damage weapon, you'd do 12 damage in 6 seconds. Add in the instant cast spell and your total is 18 damage.
---
I'm actually still enjoying BFA. I'm super excited for Classic, but not having beta hasn't been a huge disappointment for me because I still have a lot of shit I want to do on live.
---
You just fucked my mind ü§Ø
---
Lok'Tar Ogar!
---
Good question. I kill most bosses by stabbing their ankles/tail. But he has no ankles or tail. HOW. Nothing in gaming has prepared me for this.
---
That fog though. Fog made everything feel so much larger.
---
My first reaction was that this is not a good idea, but a number of reasons.  However, there might be a redeeming feature depending on how mace spec is calculated.  I don't know whether it is ppm or has a fixed proc rate.
---
If Mace spec has a fixed proc rate then you might be able to do something in pvp with a dw arms spec.  You wont do nearly as much damage as a more traditional warrior, but the extra control could at least be fun.
---
Im having the same urge to as well, but I've decided to wait until Classic comes out to renew my subscription. Trying to join as many people as possible in sending the message to Blizzard that Classic is why i'm reaching for my wallet. Not retail.
---
I've never understood the appeal of watching a person play a game. Now we watch people's webcams and their gameplay and it all seems very weird to me.

Hi, /u/pahbert
---
Fair point. That particular thing just really rubbed me the wrong way. Like, you can't be all about the "classic experience", but then find an exploit and purposely not report it so you can abuse it. I get that he's streaming, so it got seen and was probably reported, but it just came off supremely scummy.
---
Have you tried this with either VNC or TeamViewer? I usually find them better.
---
Starting zones do require looting if you're doing the quests. Pretty sure all of them do, but I know for a fact Orc/troll/UD do, for example. If you're just grinding the xp will split anyway, the only advantage is mob tags. If you are a class that can tag it'll be a loss to group up.
---
Makes sence, Ty.
---
I'm just saying, that will be the only required profession, and it is so good in pvp, if you had to say one prof is "need" level quality, it's engineering in Vanilla.
---
haha it was mainly a joke about not eating junk food and tweaking on red bull
---
48 regions server type combos? Let's be real the only that matter are US and EU, and only servers that matter are PVP and PVE. So the vast majority of players will be playing in these regions on a PVP server. Do you really think there is only going to be a single US EAST PVP server?

I come from osrs and started playing bfa 3 weeks ago. Game is super fun especially if you do dungeons in between questing
---
Meant 440. I think you need 140 from gear
---
Can someone show me what a good 0/30/21 build would look like?
---
Yep, I'm just saying, if there is one profession that is a "need" in vanilla, it's engineering, since hardcore raiding guilds will require it, and it is so damn awesome in pvp.
---
I hope the go the everquest route and maybe restart lol
---
I'm definitely going Horde, as I played Alliance almost exclusively before and I'll be looking to experience the other side. 
---
I'm currently levelling a Druid, Warlock, Shaman and Rogue (and probably a Mage and Priest too) on a free account to get a feel for them and see if there's one I'd prefer to play over Druid. Honestly the modern versions bear very little resemblance to their Vanilla versions though, so I might just be wasting my time.
---
Leatherworking and not buying unnecessary skills will go a long way. You can always ask a loan from a pala/warlock friend.
---
Honestly sounds exactly like your average mega spam invite guild on retail saying they do all this shit and in reality kill 2 normal bosses a week.
---
owo what's this
---
Dang! Thanks anyways
---
My expectation is that Iron and other Chromium forks will not follow Google's lead on this.
---
What ?
---
In a world infested with ignorance, it's the ones with ideas and thoughts that are burned at the stake.  *shrugs*
---
Can't be helped.
---
warlocks are still very fast levelers and they can also farm gold quite effectively at 60. I really think you should just disregard the hunter and level your warlock first with mining/herb or mining/eng. Just my opinion, obviously do whatever you want.
---
This is cute.  The druid is the real MVP.
---
No, because you get a specific penalty to hit for dual wielding. your "miss" chance would normally be 5% for a 2 hander, or a single 1 handed weapon. Dual wielding bumps your miss chance up to 24%, and you have to compensate for that. (this is JUST for white hits, your special attacks have a different hit table).
---
the only ones that require looting in the starting area for orcs is sting of the scopid, cactus apples and sarkoth.
---
sarkoth is on a very short respawning timer, the cactus apples are literally everywhere and the scorpio takes maybe the only ones that give you real trouble.
---
trust me is doable.
---
Tauren starting area has more and I havent had issues with 50 people or more in the zone.
---
Lol you don‚Äôt need to be an ‚Äúentitled cry baby p server player‚Äù to not want the entirety of zone general chats to be a spam of ‚ÄúINV TO GOOD LAYER PLS‚Äù.
---
Okay, let's give you even more benefit of the doubt. The only regions that "matter" (even though more people play WoW in China and the rest of Asia than anywhere else in the world) are:
---
Oceania, US Pacific, US Mountain, US Central, US East, and the six European regions.
---
That's 22 servers.
---
With layering and the successful populations we've seen on the stress tests, they could service 1.1 million people with just one server type per each of these regions.
---
You're delusional if you think there's going to be a long list of servers to choose from for your region. It's possible that the biggest markets will have 2 or 3, but that's it.
---
Cheer up OP, you can beat some ass as ret in pvp!
---
You get no gold this way
---
Good mental image for sure but isn‚Äôt it caliber, as in maximum caliber?
---
Back in Vanilla, I started on both factions in release. Alliance, H Lock (Blackrock) and Horde T Hunter (Dethroc). I really wanted to experience both sides and the whole world. The Lock only made it to 48 before I started a NE Rogue. Both the Rogue and the Hunter made it through Cataclysm, along with a variety of alts on both sides.
---
I guess which ever faction I choose, I will be starting with the same faction ; ) Maybe I‚Äôll just start one of each again.
---
&gt;it isn‚Äôt a good thing to break up over a video game - regardless of how good the game is.
---
I actually don't agree with that.  If your 'girlfriend' shames you for enjoying your hobby (waste of time, don't want you doing it, jealous of time spent with others, etc.) then you've got a serious problem.
---
Let's say my girlfriend likes to do scrapbooking.  She uses it as an outlet for stress, time to think, and enjoyment of reflecting on memories.  If I refused to let her scrapbook and berated her about every time saying she's wasting her time and why don't you do something productive.  I'd fully expect her to blow up on me, and think she should be with someone that respects her hobbies and/or shares common interests.
---
Seems like a pretty shit thing for me to do, and quite frankly abusive.  I can easily see an unhealthy relationship ending, and could see it being the best outcome for everyone.
---
I better get going before my girlfriend finds out I'm spending too much time on reddit, cheers.

Orc Hunter or Undead Priest. I'm like 90% sure I'll end up going with the hunter, but having the ability to easily get into groups is certainly making me consider priest. That being said, I have at least 1 friend playing healer and 1 playing tank so finding a group shouldn't be too difficult especially since I plan on being one of the first 60s on the server. 
---
Also, I really want a rogue but I don't really enjoy their playstyle at 60. Stealth is just too awesome and I can avoid other rogues. Dealing with rogues is also a very high reason on my list as to why I prefer an orc hunter over a priest, since an orc hunter can deal with them very well. A squishy priest? not so much
---
I'm still using their addon all these years later!  They're not the best guides anymore, especially the TBC zones, but as an alt guy I use them all the time.  Jame's guides were as good as Joana's and he had guides for Alliance as well, all for free on the website.  [www.wow-pro.com](https://www.wow-pro.com) if you're interested.
---
Lol, no.
---
8-9 PM is the **start** time. I‚Äôll clarify, thanks.
---
Very interesting. Where do you learn all this stuff?
---
Give me a holler if you want any help. I‚Äôm a software test engineer and just recently over the last 4 months taught myself JavaScript, more specifically typescript. Also been developing some front end components in react in an away environment. It‚Äôs really igniting a passion for programming and now I‚Äôm hungry to learn and practice!
---
STOPPP you're making my choice harder because I want all 4 of these!
---
See below :)

Which one of the bugs? They did fix the fact they could be infinitely kited (basically taking them out of the fight), they also fixed the summoners being infinitely kitable thank gosh. I haven't had issues with em recently, but the summoning process is outdated and difficult for new people to do as it FEELS like it isn't working but it is
---
this is a very solid argument. Also, like someone else said, skeletal mounts and benediction is also a huge plus
---
The one thing that stood out most to me was that the prices were always higher on the Alliance auction house.

Find a group
---
That‚Äôs the staff of jordan
---
It's a 4% base chance to resist all spells in PVP against a same level target and there are several talents and abilities that can reduce this further, not to mention the talents and abilities that reduce spell damage taken.
---
you pretty much have to group for it and wait a couple of levels like 22-24 to do it.
---
You need 315. +10 from either weapon and +5 from the enchant, or +20 from both weapons gets you there. Higher skill level has never affected the drop rate of a node.
---
Cactus apples alone are one person loot, there will be hundreds waiting constantly. That's assuming you can kill enough boars to get to it. Then there's peons. That's annoying enough when you're alone on a server..
---
I'm not in beta but I've heard that they're still removed.
---
It‚Äôll be more pronounced. You‚Äôll have 60s in MC and Ony gear camping TM and STV 2 wks in being near unkillable unless another hardcore guild shows up
---
Majordomo didn't have loot until patch 1.4(or 5?) so he shouldn't have before phase 2.
---
Tank you require some gear so might take you longer to grind depending if your going ally or horde I‚Äôd say paladin is pretty casual for healing the random dungeon in ret at least when i played one on a p server had no bother and if you wanna tank dungeons at a later stage or dps the option is always there
---
This is why vanilla wow is best wow, no one had the same gear
---
This really brought me back, I definitely threw my Alliance one out years ago.
---
Orgrimmar, home. At least it was before blizzard fucked everything up.
---
I mean Wintergrasp is a battleground you can queue into now. Definitely not the same thing. But as someone who did Wintergrasp back in Wrath, I LOVE the new battleground. It got adapted to the format perfectly
---
I request t3 warrior and t2 shaman, my fav sets
---
I've found that an insta 60 server is great for testing out any classes you've been thinking of playing, while also not burning you out since all you really do is duel people or battlegrounds. Everything else will still feel fresh once classic comes out, and by the time BGs come out in classic, your burnout will be gone
---
I made this face at that tip so many times
---
leveling to 60 in the beta when your character is gonna get wiped in two months is some aggressively NPC shit to do. just relax and play something else for two months.
---
shows how much you know you loot them off trees and the boars are neutral. for the boars you just need to kill them which at worse can be done in a group. same for peons. also dynamic spawns do exist. and with that many people at the start with everything dying you're gonna run into problems where enemy mobs will spawn on top of you and killing you.
---
Regarding the 2 dalarans paradox thingy you mentioned.. northrend dalaran is technically not there anymore as far as lore is concerned. Its only there in game for gameplat reasons as it is required for going through wrath content.
---
I thought it was just a 0% chance at 299 and rising with every point after that but I didn't play a skinner in vanilla so my memory is almost definitely wrong, thanks for the clarification.
---
I feel like you weren't grinding for the sake of grinding, you were just still waiting for a GODDAMN PRISTINE YETI HORN TO DROP FFS
---
Arcane Missiles üò¨
---
I think most reasonably people agree that raid design in general has always been one of WoW's strong suites.
---
Sure there have been some crappy raids here and there, but over all it's one of the things that hasn't  turned to total shit.,
---
Sure, but instant poison is applied many many times per fight, kick is a niche ability that you only use on Spellcasters and has a cooldown.
---
NPCs in AV all drop loot, most using drop tables that have a small chance of gear. AV also has nodes for e.g. mining. 
---
It‚Äôs glorious haha
---
Here ya go! :D

I've been looking into paladin a lot. Lots of people say you can heal most of the content with only 20 or 21 points into holy. As long as you have okay gear , going into holy and prot can allow for you to tank dungeons, solo content, and then heal in pretty much any situation, albeit a little worse than a full healer. You can also take the reckoning talent for some burst in PvP. 
---
That's my plan, tank earlier content, see if I can do early raids as holy. If you can get t2 a ret/holy or shockadin build is actually pretty good too.
---
Wow this is awesome. Any chance there is a similar warlock like guide that you know of?
---
The beta release has got me playing on a Pserver. I know I will abandon that character forever when classic releases so I wish I was able to put this time towards the beta instead.
---
This is also for sale on my dead server, crushridge.
---
I‚Äôll definitely enjoy the game more not having beta because I hate leveling. But I still have a WoW crave some I‚Äôm playing on an instant level 60 server and practicing different classes and getting used to tanking.
---
You don't need to kill the elite, just pickpocket the key from the patrols, get to the top of the tower, sap the elite, and loot the chest.
---
&gt; \#1 BG rated Gladiator in TBC for 2s/3s/5s here.
---
Fuck druids in arena running around poles for 15 minutes.
---
So wrong engi requires alot of money so doinng while lvling your main would only slow you down
---
classicdb.ch is a great lightweight and adfree alternative to wowhead, but it's also an outdated pserver database. Good website to quickly look up an item and see who drops/sells it, but there are lots of small details that are wrong, especially regarding itemization.
---
You play retail? I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.
---
By mage best leveller do you mean best leveller between the 2 classes? Because hunter is hands down the best leveller on launch weeks you won't find packs of mobs to aoe.
---
Because alliance is for babies!
---
 They consider it griefing, and they do.
---
I'm already going Boomkin. Don't care what the high end guilds or guides tell me. I'm not trying to be a top 1% player. I'm playing to enjoy Vanilla all over again and part of that is playing what you want to play not what the hardcore players tell you to play.
---
Yes, what part of what I said implies you loot cactus apples off anything other than the cactus around the area..? Each of them is still only loot able to the first to click it until it respawns.
---
Boars being neutral has zero impact on them being spawn farmed. They are dynamic spawns, they aren't going to be spawning THAT fast though. Private servers might have tainted your view though.
---
Sharding also splits servers to populations equivalent to vanilla server populations, as in about 3k. Far from 50.
---
"shows how much you know" though, eh?
---
In wish I could afford a Herman Miller chair as pictured
---
I'll be playing Horde, so Paladin isn't an option.  If I was somehow convinced to play Alliance, I'd definitely be rolling a pally.
---
Yea sorry I should have clarified that I felt it was the best leveller between the two, I agree with hunter being best generally though
---
I never came across anything similar but you can find a lot of different spreadsheets on the warlock discord (pre raid bis, raid bis, spell theorycrafting etc): https://discord.gg/CvupGGV
---
You could clear MC, ony BWL in under an hour
---
It would be really cool if they had a server for people that only wanted to play 8 hours a day max, and they limited your play time. I mean it would be a terrible idea in practice probably but it's nice to think about being on a more level playing field.
---
The irony
---
It was a joke ,sir.
---
There is something called Dual Wield Hit Penalty; For equal level targets you normally have 5% chance to miss with auto attacks (2h or 1h+shield), but when dual wielding you suffer a penalty and you need 24% hit to never miss with auto attacks. Special attacks (Mortal Strike, Overpower etc.) also only need 5% hit to never miss as the dual wield penalty doesn't affect them. Also off-hand weapons only deal 50% of the damage (Fury has talent to increase off-hand damage).
---
Not true lol yikes
---
I still think it‚Äôs bullshit they removed first aid
---
Standing on that exact hill, LOS behind the totem, and taking pot shots on my hunter are some of my favorite WOW memories.
---
I figured I would replace something from those quests, just wasn't sure what :) thanks for the info!
---
Nice!  While my guild got into Nax, we didn't do a whole lot.  Love the organisation of the raid recap.
---
A lot of googling, to be honest. Mostly, I hear stuff like this on forums or on podcasts while playing, and then I google it myself to find a wiki to confirm it.
---
Rofl that is hilarious. I remember "tanking" as a warrior and I didn't even go into defensive stance because it "has less abilities". We wiped a lot but I was too young and clueless to realize it was my fault.
---
Lol yeah, real yikes next to 3 frost mages
---
Is that from the Linken quest line?
---
How can I pickpocket his head?
---
To the best of my knowledge, the only thing that progressively improved as you got a higher skill level was the odds of successfully harvesting a node. 
---
At 1/75 mining, you have some odds of failing to loot a copper node. Once you have more, you won't fail anymore. You might be confusing this with the loot table.
---
I'm curious about things like this. I like to know if scholo strat will be in there nerfed state that came in with tier 0.5 at release
---
Flip a coin
---
Gotcha. Basically the same situation for me with shaman.
---
Gotta start thinking like someone who knows what he's talking about man... you actually have to loot the head of the elite.
---
A lot of them are toxic....but Sonii, Venruki, and Kala are the fucking best.
---
Fk the thesaurus...I need therapy.

Interesting, thanks for linking it.
---
There‚Äôs a strategy my older brother taught me when I was young, choose each thing for heads or tails, flip the coin, if you get a choice and you feel disappointed at all then always just pick the other one anyways, it‚Äôs usually worked for me in most things that I‚Äôm indecisive for
---
Ambush is supposed to bring him to 50% hp if the server is not trash. Read the quest and/or the little manuscript they gave you they give you tips about how to clear the quest as a lvl 20.
---
there are no dynamic spawns on private servers because  not everything is always looted and or dead. there will be dynamic spawns on the classic version of the game. obviously it's not gonna be bfa, people are aware of this and no one cares. of you know how to be proficient and loot when you can loot, kill a quest mob when you see one and do a little bit of everything at the same time you'll be fine. yes you will have to grind at times. That's how the game was. but it's not like getting your first 5 levels will take 5 hours either. if they do your doing something very wrong. if you cant get your first 5 levels in 45 minutes you get it in an hour or so it's still fine.its just the first area after that everyone goes diffrent ways and routes.

I have a shirt that was gifted to me, it‚Äôs a 1994 Grateful Dead shirt. With a fear and loathing style print with the bears and skeletons.

It has two huge holes. It‚Äôs quite Unwearable but t will never be trashed.

Soon I will make a copy of it some how and have it forever

Probably because it didn't feel like a game of soccer and more like a battle
---
Illidan shoots a big laser at Icecrown in an attempt kill the Lich King during Warcraft 3 and it weakens him pretty badly, causing him to lose control over part of his army.  Those he lost control over become the playable undead.
---
On private servers its 10 for everything/20 for pole arms.  Is this different from how classic will be?
---
This person is known, yet saying stupid shit?
---
yep after 3 months of grinding then to have it taken and having to start over, i think most people would start a quick grind and just peter out. not everyone is a hardcore sperg like we used to be. the streamers have been interesting and diverse to watch, regardless of all the frantic complaining about them.
---
I think I have some ammo and old starting armor on some character somewhere.
---
Something that you wont find in any boomkin guides that will help you is that starfire needs 2 consecutive crits to benefit from natures grace under normal circumstances. So you need a macro that stops your starfire cast if you get a crit and starts a new one. With normal ms. Its only a 0.2s time save on the cast. Even if you arent playing an optimal spec you should still play the spec optimally. Best of luck!! Im cheering for you to play what makes you happy.
---
It is! Probably should have screen captured the actual pic.
---
Can a boomkin weave in melee attacks between back to back spell casts? Maybe with a macro?
---
Do you have any experience leading a large guild for 2 years or longer?
---
you were crafty with the UI back then. I was on all base settings lol
---
I didn't see the Horde part of your question and updated my post.
---
All things related to class mechanics like talents abilities stats etc. is all going to be the 1.12 version.
---
I never played vanilla; I played on the big name private servers but didn‚Äôt get to far into progression past 60; before classic was ever announced. the leveling for the first time was the best in my entire experience with vanilla servers. Since classic was announced I haven‚Äôt touched it again and I plan to enjoy the leveling process on release. I see why people want to rush to 60 and why others don‚Äôt; it‚Äôs all how you want to enjoy the game. Can‚Äôt wait for aug; bad part is that I‚Äôm taking the entire month of July off from work and beginning of August( I‚Äôm moving between cities) I wish this break came during the classic release; what am I going to do with myself. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get in the beta though; cause the I would rush and miss out on a lot of things like farming gear from dungeons before moving on and awesome quest chains like the ZF mallet.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve created and led raiding guilds every xpack since Wrath (minus Panda, which I skipped entirely).
---
When I leveled as Boomkin it was actually faster to go cat form with horribly inappropriate gear than to nuke things. I can't see any point to it. I think that playing a unique spec in raids can be fun for the utility, but I don't see the joy of leveling more slowly but with colorful lights.
---
I guess having access to nature's swiftness is pretty nice, if you spec into resto while killing with casting?
---
I love that you triggered twitch nerds with this, have my upvote
---
I get your point of view. But I disagree. Level 39 Warrior on the Beta with mount money in my bags. Can‚Äôt wait to do it all again when launch hits.
---
Shield had defense too IIRC
---
Hi, /u/Safroon710
---
That's good to hear! He was one of the top players back in the days.
---
Do you have a source for that? Not being a smart ass, I would genuinely like to read up on that.
---
What's a Salsasnack
---
This is a good point; I have been thinking about it; and won‚Äôt touch my ui till I get past the first major city and out of the starter zone. But if I had beta I can have it ready...
---
Not the playable ones.  Pretty much all of the evil nelfs are either naga or satyrs now.  The Forsaken are almost definitely the most morally dubious playable faction.  You could say that pre-BFA they're just trying to exist in a world that hates them and remain free, but the devil is in the details.  So many of the quests you do on behalf of the Forsaken are morally fucked.
---
Just seeing Quel'serrar is proof enough that this screenshot is legit ( since the quest-line was removed somewhere at the end of tbc i think), although it might have been taken somewhere near tbc launch or pre-patch I think, though still relevant so don't listen to the naysayers!
---
‚ÄúI definitely won't farm Dungeons like a Retard, so that I can't see SM anymore in August.‚Äù
---
You had me at the first half!
---
Personally I think mage is just amazing.  They can do everything and are great for solo or group play. You really can‚Äôt go wrong playing one.   Warrior is fun but requires a lot more work and hardship but has awesome payoff once you get rolling, way more inconveniences though.   I played warrior in vanilla, going mage this time around.  If I change my mind I can use my mage to fund a warrior...lion heart helm and some other goodies
---
Mage, portals, free water and food, repair cost less.
---
A very tasty treat!

---
People claimed damage was way lower than it should be because pserver damage was much higher. Blizzard said no, the lower damage is correct. If you play on a pserver and then compare to beta, generic mob damage too is lower
---
Afaik, Blizzard is fully on board with the NoChanges movement, as horrible as it is in some regards. There are certain things they HAD to change, like friends list and loot-all to make it work with the new client, but they have no intention of rebalancing or changing classes and stuff from what I remember them saying. 
---
They could always change their mind, but I think they would have already done that if they wanted to. A big part of the charm to a lot of people that they liked about Classic was exactly how imbalanced all the classes were, so changing that would kill a lot of the flavor. At best, you might see some UI changes, or low-key quality of life fixes that have zero effect on gameplay.
---
Hi, /u/howmanyusersnames
---
Because "LF2M DM" in trade chat shouldn't require you shift-clicking someone's name to check their level to make sure they were talking about the dungeon you were running. It was never a dyslexic typo, it was obviously the acronym for the dungeon's last boss. Dyslexia wouldn't make someone ever type VC over DM and the letters aren't even close on the keyboard.

Unless you're trolling in which case 10/10 gg

I‚Äôd love an app that functioned as a mix between discord and LFG.

You log in, pick what realm you‚Äôre on, and then you get placed in a chat server with everyone else from your realm using the app.

---
Hi, /u/sambone6699
---
I think I had one once. It was in the back room of this place in Tijuana.
---
Is mage as boring as people say they are though? I hear a lot of jokes about ‚Äúfrostbolt frostbolt frostbolt‚Äù and thats just something I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy end game, I like to have the options and rotation, the appealing tbing with mage is just it‚Äôs so convenient, easy money, easy levelling, portals, food and drinks, I could tell I wouldn‚Äôt get bored while levelling but I fear more for end game
---
That's a very strange way to look at it. It's one of the few good damage dealing abilities for a ret pally, and is great for leveling. So in the end, it does matter. Saying it doesn't matter because ret pallys dont do great DPS is stupid. 
---
I'm trying to understand my spells so that when I DO end up having to do damage on occasion instead of healing, I can bring as much as I can to the table.
---
Yes that is the staff Jordan has equipped.  
---
üòè
---
Spell power gear for mages is way better for leveling than you are making it out to be. It's incredibly easy to build up a bunch of +damage gear as a mage.
---
Lets go into the gear for a frost mage:
---
At around 20 you can get the Icicle Rod which gives +10 frost damage
---
At 23 you can equip the Azure Silk Pants which give +10 frost damage
---
At 24 you can equip the Azure Silk Gloves which give +10 frost damage
---
At 25 you can grab the Azure Silk Vest which gives +7 frost damage.
---
At level 30 you can equip the Azure Silk Cloak which gives +10 frost damage
---
In the low 30s you can do an SM Library run to get a wand that gives +9 frost damage
---
At 33 you can equip the Azure Shoulders for +13 frost damage
---
At 35 you can equip the Star Belt for +13 spell damage
---
If you're a tailor you can switch the Azure Silk Vest for a Robe of Power in the mid 30s really easily. This gives an additional +6 effective spell power.
---
This is all without any frozen wrath greens, and none of these items are even very hard to make. I'm playing on the beta and the AH is completely flooded with Azure Silk gear. This is on the PvE server as well, which has a far lower population. Once you get into the high 30s black/red mageweave gear starts to become easy to come by which gives you even more spell power. If you take a level 30 mage their frostbolt does 126 to 139 damage. Frostbolt gets 85.7% of the spell power damage applied to it and so a level 30 mage with green frost damage gear does 166 to 189 damage with their frost bolt. So with green items you've increased your DPS by 30% and your damage per mana by 30%. The next rank of frostbolt only does 174 to 191 damage, so you've effectively turned your rank 6 frostbolt into a more mana efficient Rank 7 one.
---
Spell power essentially gives you a rank advantage on your spells and not only helps you kill faster but increases how much damage you do per point of mana expended. Intellect only gives a very small amount of critical chance so does almost nothing for your damage per mana. So you can cast 3-4 more frost bolts but they do far less damage.
---
Hey thanks for that link man!
---
Damage/healing and no honor ranks. Definitely TBC
---
As a wrathbaby, I consider Naxxramas "home". I am considering pushing hard in Classic just so I can raid it again (and raid the original version).
---
Classic may as well be the start of WoW 2. If they decide on a 1.13 patch if people are begging for more content then isn't that basically what it is? Or if they decide the make TBC more in line with vanilla.
---
I still have my ravencrests legacy sword from the aq40 scepter questline. I finished the questline well after the first gong ringer so i am not a scarab lord but i kept the misc items along the way. Probably a few other things too but im too lazy to check.
---
Autobots Roll out!!
---
There's a lot he could be talking about tbh.  Azshara and the Highborne sold out to the Legion before it was cool and basically blew up the world in the process, and even the innocent nelfs are just kind of dicks.
---
I still don't think it's true in the least, because even by the logic of counting everything any member of a race has done, the orcs are just as bad if not worse.
---
Mulgore has the best starting zone music so you've got that going for you, which is nice.
---
Nice edit/explanation tho :)
---
Haunted momento!
---
Did you inject the Devil's Lettuce, my dude?
---
Watching Horde fan boys defend the Hitler metaphor that is Garrosh and his storm troopers is always hilarious.
---
if mostly solo playing then go mage, if you gunna be grouping a lot go warrior.
---
I still have my moist towelette.
---
It's been confirmed that they were, but we have no idea what kind of algorithm was used to determine spawn time. All that "dynamic" means in this context is that spawn times were affected by player actions, but it doesn't tell us how much could they be reduced, or what actions reduced spawn time.
---
It could be that a hours of unending spawn-camping a mob might bring the respawn time down to 80% of normal, and that would still count as dynamic respawns. I suspect that the original dynamic respawn system was closer to this than to the spawn rates seen on some p-servers.
---
Nerfed version. Resto for PvE, Ele for PvP.
---
I only kept my tier gear on my rogue to look cool in shattrah during TBC.
---
Ya it's a double edged sword.
---
Well frost bolt spam is a thing, but only in raids. Warriors, rogues, warlocks...they all have boring rotations as well in raids.  But there‚Äôs definitely more than just frostbolt. Yes it‚Äôs pretty much your only damage spell. But you still use mana gems aggressively to manage your mana, decurse, have blink or ice block to avoid damage or mechanics, evocate... etc etc and that‚Äôs only until aq when you can go fire.   But outside of raids, in dungeons and world content and pvp(probably 95% of your playtime) you have way more spells at your hand than warrior.   Playing a mage in the open world is 1000000% more fun than a warrior.   Also I HATE buffing battle shout every 2 minutes.     :p
---
Damn dude. Ain‚Äôt that the fucking truth. 
---
Gotta keep above the bullshit and not let those outside forces confuse ya. I‚Äôm personally horrible at it.
---
And it's beautiful. Nice way to start the Vanilla experience again.
---
PvE is boring, but PvP there's more high IQ things you can do
---
Same here. I played in vanilla, and I know if I had access I'd play the hell out it.. And burn myself out early. I'm glad I get to wait and just go at it  normally with everyone else. It's not like I was even planning to raid or anything.
---
Ur also missing stoneform (great to get away from the million UD rogues crippling and cleaning viper Sting) and two good priest speld.
---
If I‚Äôm not running Smoking Heart, which is preferred? Force of Will or Mark the Chosen?
---
You will be expected to tank in every dungeon run you join, otherwise they need to get another warrior who will tank and you two will need the same loot. Unless you have a feral druid who really wants to tank you should be ready and willing to tank, it's not that difficult especially in early game dungeons.
---
I have a group I won‚Äôt really be levelling much with till like 20+ they are:
---
Friend 1:
---
assasination rogue
---
Friend 2:
---
Holy priest or restro shaman
---
Friend 3:
---
Destro warlock
---
Friend 4:
---
Fury Warrior 
---
And we have two more who only will be doing dps but can join raids and etc if we need them
---
Friend 5:
---
Assassination Rogue
---
Friend 6:
---
Shadow priest (won‚Äôt do healing)
---
You'll want to kite and skip packs anyway, so more dps is most useful.
---
I'm in the beta played a class and faction I isually wouldn't. I enjoyed the lvl 30 meta so much it was different than any pvp before. Looking forward to doing the same at 40. Prob will stop at 50 but I love this.
---
Maybe not to the Forsaken but feel free to try and defend his treatment of the elves...
---
You can farm an eye of shadow in Winterspring off the elites in Darkwhisper
---
Vanilla Radar. A v. H statistics of a server that shall remain nameless because AutoMod.
---
They almost recreated that with that one zone in WOTLK. It was almost better because it wasn't just a BG
---
Boomkin bros over here.
---
I‚Äôm just saying it doesn‚Äôt matter how the spell functions. It‚Äôs still your only option when it comes to dps so you‚Äôre going to use it regardless of how it works.

But ye if you use mana you're drinking anyway and tailoring gear gives a decent advantage.
---
I‚Äôve played both in Vanilla raids. Tanks are more active with controlling the flow and positioning, and healers just dodge ground effects and play a UI mini game.  I prefer to be more active when I raid so I prefer tanking.  It boils down to what your goals are. If you want to be a part of a raiding guild without talking much and relaxing healer it is. Tank positions will be more limited and depending on the quality of DPS the spamming of threat will bring you closer to carpal tunnel.
---
You want to prioritize getting ahead early on, not getting future goals out of the way, so the whole flightpath stuff isn't that smart. As for the 1¬Ω levels, this very slow leveling compared to other explore strats, and even those are really shit.
---
Depending on what class you play duo leveling can be an option.  
---
For example if you play a warlock or a warrior having a healer class with you can be very beneficial or if your a mage, doing double mage AoE farming can be really good too or with even more mages you can AoE grind dungeons.  
---
I'm gonna be playing a warlock and I'll try to get a priest/paladin/druid as a partner to level, it's way more fun, I can lifetap and do huge pulls with multidotting, be much safer if some horde scum attack us.  
---
Obviously the healer class with you would run on a dps spec going full healer is pointless for early levels, if someone wants to meme and go balance druid for leveling that can work well too or as a feral the druid can tank and dps aswell, for paladin you'd obviosuly go prot nothing else makes any sense for leveling and shadow for the priest.  
---
As you've said you want to roll a warrior or a mage those are both excelent for duo leveling just get a healer class if you're a warrior same as the lock or do the double mage AoE grinding stuff.
---
I consider the holy trinity when picking my class: Leveling, Endgame, and goofing off. For leveling, you decide on the difficulty you want while leveling, Warriors are difficult, both requiring consumables to level at a decent pace while being gear dependent for good damage, whereas hunters and warlocks can level naked with relative ease, due to pets being able to bear the brunt of enemy assaults. Endgame is deciding what you want to do when you get there, do you want to heal? 5 mans and raids will never be a problem to get into, and there are a lot of cool tricks to learn to manage your mana to become 'that healer' that everyone in your guild waits to log on so they can run dungeons with. Do you want to tank? 5 mans are similarly easy to get groups, but raids will require a lot of commitment, and if you aren't playing a warrior people will give you shit. DPS is great at endgame for raids, but 5 mans will be loaded with them, everyone will want your stuff. Farming and running around while occasionally doing some of the higher content will be the best way to play in this role. Finally, most importantly, goofing off. Your going to spend a lot of time doing nothing of significance in this game, you can be the sweatiest try hard on your server and still you will find yourself waiting for groups, logging on and realizing all the farm zones are occupied, or just hanging out and chatting with guildies, what do you want to fill that time with? Ganking in stranglethorn or another zone is a great time killer, ranged dps excel at this, but a special note to rogues and hunters. Classes that can buff can hang out in lowbie zones helping people out (mages are great at this, giving out food and water to others), Having good AoE means running low level dungeons for your friends can be a snap, Mages can portal and warlocks can summon. You can explore the world with farsight on a shaman without ever leaving the dungeon entrance (while waiting for a group) and levitate and water walk means you can fish in the less crowded spots. Hide and seek can be fun, especially if your class has a lot of mobility to get into areas people aren't normally, or maybe you just want to use it to parkour around town. 
---
Hopefully this will serve as a guide to help you figure out what class you want to play as we get closer to the release date.
---
They didn‚Äôt kill shaman at the end of BC. If I remember correctly shaman got stronger toward the end of BC.
---
You know there's a LOT of vanilla fans in the late teens and early twenties right?
---
Friends messaged me about playing horde in classic after I've been on KT-Ally for years. That's about it. I'm going to be troll resto shaman, now.
---
BY FIRE BE PURGED!
---
They should bring back screenshot of the day. Or even have it here on this sub stickied at the top.
---
I'm still torn on this, I haven't decided if I want to do a profession or just gather while leveling.
---
Are you aware that the youngest boomers are 55 years old?
---
I leveled as Boomkin once, and I still was in Cat Form most of the time because you just couldn't nuke things remotely fast enough for it to be worth it. The downtime was...atrocious.
---
I think what they could do for pvp servers, since you're either alliance or horde have a separate population limit.  
---
So for example instead of 3k server cap, have a 1.5k alliance cap and 1.5k horde cap on pvp servers.
---
Happy to clarify and explain further if you would post a response and explain why you disagree and not just "LOL NO UR WRONG".
---
I was 2300/2400+ in 2s, 3s, and 5s. The 2s meta wass broken, sure, but you could not pillar hump for 15+ minutes in 5v5s or 3v3s. [When I left WoW, I had the highest combined Arena rating in the world.](https://imgur.com/H2rjvqN) Surely, I must know something. Otherwise, how could I beat the other druids?
---
Starting new with a Night elf druid. I played horde for years and hated on alliance. made the switch in Wrath to get into a raiding guild that was somewhat serious, and realized both sides are more or less the same. Now I want to get all those awesome vanilla quests with a fresh pair of eyes. Druid because they were underrepresented in vanilla, and they have a lot of utility and mobility for the world, while also being a really mana efficient healer.
---
Thanks, I never really did the downranking thing so this will help a lot.
---
There was surely racism involved but it was also a completely understandable trust thing.  When your sister kingdom gets wiped out overnight as a direct result of a shocking betrayal and a ravenous horde of mind-controlled zombies, you're not going to believe the previously mind-controlled zombies when they say "Hey it's us, your friends!  We're not mind-controlled anymore and won't instantly betray you!  Honest!"
---
To the rest of the Alliance it was basically the [Hey Its Me Ur Brother](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hey-its-me-ur-brother) meme.
---
Mage will be easier to pull off with your goals.
---
I know they've said this but there is still time to convince them.
---
Shamans and paladins can, so presumably so can moonkins.
---
What does that have to do with it being the best profession in vanilla?  No one says you have to do it while leveling, no one says you have to have it at all, but it still the clearly best prof from a gameplay standpoint.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go orc hunter, I‚Äôm more of a pvp fan. Also vanilla hunters sooooooo much fun to play and the skill curb between a good and bad hunter is tremendous
---
Yep. I don't understand all these people talking about min/maxing and how they want to do X but Y will be better for endgame raids. Guys, the game is almost old enough to vote. 99.9 (repeating of course) percent of you aren't going to be making money off of it, just sit back and enjoy playing the game like you're 14 again except now you can appreciate everything a little more. Go get ganked/corpse camped, play a ret paladin, wipe in the deadmines and politely teach that newb warrior how to use taunt so he can be better and you get a reliable friend to run dungeons with in the future.
---
Half the posts on here all I can think of as a reply is: https://i.imgur.com/VTkkbJw.gif
---
Yeah... But other profs need to exist and not everyone wants to play multiple characters.
---
Doubt but you can think what you want
---
Alchemy is a good money making profession?
---
Baby boomers were 41 to 59 when Vanilla released.
---
You're a millennial, just like the mid-20's gamers you can't seem to relate to.
---
It's too bad so much of the community is hyper focused on level cap asap. Arguably the best and most complete part of classic wow is the 1-60 journey. Even if you've done it 100 times on retail and on private realms, each new 1-60 is another adventure to make memories and meet new people, friends and enemies. Yet so many wish to rush to 60, I guess to get pre-raid BIS lists quicker so they can find top guilds quicker by flexing their low /played to level cap?
---
Maybe I'm naive about guild recruiting, but I figure I can slowly adventure to 60 and there will still be plenty of decent raid guilds forming and recruiting a month after release.
---
Not telling others how to play, I just don't really understand the rush. Must be a lot of players who really hate leveling and want it over with so they can get to what they consider the "true game"? Running MC until BWL phase?
---
Read up on rogue dual wielding. Works the same.
---
I'll never forget the first game my brother and I played on our twinks. We made identical Troll rogues one was named Owned and the other was named Pwned.
---
The first game we both went like 72-0 and basically just camped alliance graveyard the entire game. It was a blast playing on those guys we were unkillable.
---
When my guild was coming close to downing Rag his appearance and fight were only encounters we had heard about. Not many videos had been published and I hadn‚Äôt seen any.  It is quite an interesting thing to hear about Rag in terms of lore and word of mouth, to then see his grand appearance with no real understanding to all the descriptions you had heard. It was definitely the best boss entrance and epic feel to Vanilla.
---
Ya, I think this is accurate. Usually happens between Vael and Chromag.
---
I'm here for this. Haven't played on a pserver, but this subreddit doesn't exact have the most well adjusted individuals and a fucking nazi guild was already kicked from the Guild Recruitment Discord. You're can bet your sweet ass I'll be reporting any people broadcasting such drivel.
---
Nope.  I stopped playing private servers as soon as Blizz announced Classic.  No desire to pay the beta, and zero interest in watching streamers.
---
I know people want to say "this doesnt matter, cry more" but like this is important to the FEEL of the class. This doesnt FEEL right, they need to fix it back to the ice skating

I see why it was removed but obviously wasn‚Äôt a shit show
---
What?? Every mage in naxx will be fire.
---
As far as we've understood from Blizzard, there won't be any planned patches. All the content will be installed launch, but some of it will be locked behind simple server flags. The servers will reverse these flags over maintenance and the new phase will start.
---
Every item, quest, talent, and ability will be using it's 1.12 form.
---
Aliteral Valley brings back vivid memories. Some up, some down.
---
Beta you can train all but polearms at lvl 1
---
The issue with this is that by trying to avoid streamers and their spergs you get on a server with pserver spergs.
---
That's exactly why I never play betas of any games.  Losing all your progress just blows.
---
Does it automatically bubble hearth?
---
Nice.

BARREN'S ROAAAADS, TAKE ME HOME
---
@mouseover exists.  Just wonder how the totems will work.  Currently I can multishot a furbolg and it will hit his totem automatically.  Not sure for pvp.
---
From my personal experience regardless of game, generally their fanbase goes with them wherever they go. Some do stay yes, but say Chance (Soda) happens to switch server or not play for whatever reason, I expect the people there for him will go.
---
Yeah tbf I‚Äôm not a min maxer. I work full time and go to school. I honestly think it will take me 3-5 months to get to 60. The leveling is such a huge part of Vanilla. When it comes to playing for long periods of time, I‚Äôm taking off a week of work and school so I have to get as much done in that time lol
---
Sorry it's a popular meme that most people commonly accept 23ish+ = bald guy mowing his lawn boomer
---
Based on the first 3 fights I watched, he doesn't kill anyone. He just pokes them until a bigger Alliance comes along.
---
Same here, actually, and for the same reasons.  I don't plan on playing him serious, but I've played alliance exclusively, would like to see the other side.
---
That's just the reality of classic. Reputation is everything. If you stream snipe streamers, they will hate you. If they hate you, almost everyone else will too. Welcome to vanilla, the highly flawed game that everyone has been asking for
---
21/30 Resto/Feral is the spec I went with for the great majority of vanilla.  You definitely miss out on some dps, but survivabilty is through the roof and it's great for soloing just about anything in the game.
---
Kajsdiesad Valley was the best
---
I shall always call the rolling plains of mulgore my home
---
I've always been horde. I do plan on playing a Paladin at some point as an alt though.
---
Either a Troll or Undead Male Priest. I like the Troll racials and Priest racial skills over Undead, but not as big of a fan of Troll animations and no shoes haha.
---
who gives a shit though
---
I'm talking from a speed leveling perspective, if you are playing casually then yes you can use SP gear just fine.   
---
The problem is that you need a high amount of spellpower to reach enough damage bonus that allows you to cast (at least) one less frostbolt during a fight, as long as you don't reach this threshold the SP you get did close to no difference. It's only beneficial because you shaved maybe some wand shots, so you can overkill a target and don't benefit of a couple mana ticks before pulling the next mob.
---
Now here is the other problem: while it is easy to get SP gear you will still not use any of those items because:   
---
1) If you're playing on a fresh server you'll need to get the recipes and get your tailoring skill to a certain level, doing this instead of grinding mobs/quests is a huge waste of time for what you get.  
---
2) If you're buying those items off the AH odds are you're playing on an established server in which you're better off AoE grinding because as opposed to fresh servers you can get the spots your yourself and especially at night because we will finally be able to play on regional servers.   
---
 That being said if you're AoE grinding you should prioritize stacking intellect and stamina so you don't get OOM/killed, Blizzards spell coefficient is way too low so stacking SP gear is a waste of stats for it.   
---
3) The Icicle Rod alone doesn't give you any boost that is strong enough to do anything, I'm sure you meant that you're stacking this item with all the other ones but I just figured I'd point it out.  
---
4) The Icefury Wand quest at 30 is a massive waste of time, from memory I believe you have to run to the very middle of Dustwallow Marsh a couple time and run SM Lib, this is gonna kill your xp/h big time especially because there are no dungeon quest do give you any extra XP besides the wand one.   
---
Anyway the best mage leveling method (besides the aoe grind) I could find is to get as much spirit as possible and keep grinding while picking up easy quests which doesn't you too far away and ideally is a grinding quest so you kill two birds with one stone.   
---
To this day I haven't seen a better "dps rotation" than the one I showed in one of my video, which I believe is called "Half an hour of single target farming" it's been a while I'm not too sure.
---
Is anyone actually naive enough to not think a company is going to take advantage of free marketing?
---
Made a comment on a different post regarding that. Even if I wanted to hardcore grind the game and be a top player I'd need to quit my job to do that and that ain't happening. On weekdays I'll have 5 hours a day to play assuming I don't take any overtime. I'm playing just to enjoy myself and enjoy a great game. I don't have anything against the people that want to go hardcore but they try so hard to dictate how others play and It's very annoying.
---
I resubbed with the faintest hope of getting beta access, and I did. I am glad, but I can understand your mindset. I'm not leveling seriously, but using my access to test addons and figure out which vanilla class calls to me the most. So far, it's a dead heat between priest, hunter, mage, warlock, and shaman.
---
Yeahh. First world problems...
---
1/29/21, also called Heart of the Wild is mainly a PvP spec. It's unlike any other version of feral that you've ever seen though.
---
Your gear? Mostly stam -&gt; int -&gt; spell power until you've ranked up.  
---
How does it play? Cat opener into moonfire + insect swarm, then turtle in bear form.
---
It happens to work well in small scale PvE because you take the most essential healing and feral talents. If there is such a thing as a true hybrid in classic it's HotW druid.
---
Paladin, as well. A nice 2-hander will change your life.
---
Yes. I played alliance up until mid TBC. Only class I didn't have was a paladin and since they're available to the horde I decided to reroll pally and see how things were horde side. Since then, until I quit in BFA I was a horde paladin. I intend to play alliance again in classic if nothing for the nostalgia, however I may give horde a try as a casual alt to see how vanilla was for the horde.
---
Shaman or Paladin for sure. Better give BRE or Ashkandi to the Warriors.
---
Elwyn forest
---
There's a difference between talking to someone on the other side because you're friendly with him and organizing server wide griefing.  
---
I used to chill out and fish in AB with an Orc warrior or throw snowballs at each other instead of playing the BG, that is not something Blizz would ban anyone for.  
---
Getting all the Devilsaur leather with Alliance and Horde working together 100% bannable.  
---
This what they are suggesting 200% bananble.
---
Esfand and Asmon dont say that. They've said streamers get invited as promotion.
---
They've said that the population of ETA is probably less than 1% streamers. Which is true, if you count up the streamers on twitch streaming beta, it's less than 100, and there are thousands of beta accounts
---
What a retarded comment
---
Not everyone is worried about an optimal leveling pace. Some people are just looking to find ways to play the game that they enjoy.
---
&gt; If they went into druid tanking thinking it‚Äôll be like retail then you have a point. But most people asking about it mention that they read taladril‚Äôs guide, which does point all of this out.
---
There's also plenty of people that haven't read the guide. There's also people that may not trust the guide, hence why they are asking questions here for a second opinion. You assume too much. 
---
&gt; Our druid tank transitioned to tanking from healing with some MC and ZG gear but mostly dungeon stuff.
---
So he already had some tanking gear from raids because he was healing previously.
---
&gt; Anyone who goes into vanilla thinking their item progression will be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is mistaken. This is not an argument that should dissuade from playing tank druid if they want to.
---
The point I was making was that most classes are going to at least try to get a couple of piece of tier gear. Whereas a tanking druid isn't going to use it at all. You have to remember that your answer for these questions has to come from the assumption that the poster doesn't know anything about what to expect. 
---
&gt; Lastly, farming pummelers sounds daunting but it‚Äôs not nearly that bad. Especially as alliance druid you can go do it instead of waiting around in IF. You basically sneak to the boss, kill him, then reset. There‚Äôs a video by skarmtank where he does it as footage for the Q&amp;A.
---
Great but you're missing the point entirely. It's not really a selling point when you have to do something like that to be "at your best". It means that you're forced to plug a gap in game design. That should be noted for the poster that is asking.
---
Nah, I think a lot of people are just like you. Much as I'd love to be in the beta, I'm kind of glad I'm not. Don't want to get burnt out on a game that isn't even out yet.
---
Like what?
---
As someone that was in the beta, and leveled to 35... I can say that I had a very similar outcome.
---
I played a bit too much, tried to keep up with the streamers..and burnt out a little. It also sucks playing without your RL friends. I was pouring hours into a game where my progress was guaranteed to be deleted in a matter of weeks.
---
Yes. I will tank for you as a bear.
---
look boys, got a karma farmer here
---
It depends on your goals in game. If you want to : achieve rank 12 and up PvP, become scarab lord, wield Thunderfury, Atiesh, and probably Hand of Ragnaros, have BiS gear in every phase, or lead a guild, then a LOT of your time will be spent in game. 
---
If you have more modest goals, you can be as casual as you want. Classic offers a lot of goals that feel fulfilling when reached.
---
You can play on a server with people that have no track record of abusing a server and can at maximum influence ~120 guildmates, assuming they're all online.
---
Or you can play on a server with streamers that DO have a track record of abusing a server and can influence tens of thousands of players at once.
---
Up to you.
---
Normal sized dwarf, sitting on a stool I'm pretty sure.
---
Thats a yikes from me dawg.
---
Which one was that?
---
Tbh if you think rogue is B tier, you're doing it wrong. 1v1 you'll probably get beat by good hunters, but that's about it. 
---
They're also pretty great flag carriers with sprint, evasion, trinket and possibly racial, especially if you have support.
---
They also only have hunters to compete with in battleground damage although not having mana gives them a pretty big advantage.
---
 
---
Now the overwhelming majority of twink rogues were pretty bad, there were only around 10 in the ruin battle group that ever gave me trouble.
---
Otherwise pretty good video, but being a former 19 rogue player with around 20,000 hks through vanilla and tbc, I felt the need to defend my baby.
---
Go to vendor and press  buyback. 
---
Then buy back your items
---
yes, sitting on a stool :)
---
Lmao what a fucking joke!
---
3, 4 and 5 
---
They seem like such small things on paper, but you cannot argue against Vanilla WoWs ability to generate organic player interactions. 
---
God damn I can't wait for gamers to start making games again, I really hope Classic is able to turn some heads and we can regress a bit, from every dev trying to shove their next micro transaction/lootbox down our collective throat. sorry :( /rantover
---
Like you said it's not a great tank or a healer for good reason. HotW is a PvP spec. It just happens to work well enough in PvE because it takes some of the best talents in the talent trees.
---
Well fuck. Guess I'll be finding a new browser. Probably Firefox if they hold up to allowing the adblockers.
---
Blizzard banned his account from WoW for account sharing, they didn't ban him personally.
---
He's been playing Hearthstone on a new Battle.NET account.
---
I don't see why Blizzard wouldn't give him the Beta like any other major streamer.
---
More pleeeeease! Shaman?

Wherever you go, the drums of war still play in Ogrimmar. Wherever you may be, Ogrimmar is your home.

---
Alliance can also mix and overlap for quick questing
---
Grats you bothered to play 5s. You'd be a great person to ask about arena in 2008 for sure. Doesn't have a whole lot to do with vanilla pvp which has an entirely different dynamic to arenas, and druids are completely different.  
---
We get it, you have OG e-cred, that's great. Statements like this
---
&gt;In PvP, druids are the absolute best healer - Impossible to contain or shutdown while healing on the run.  
---
are just humorous though, and show you have very little understanding of both vanilla pvp and druids.
---
I'd be pretty surprised if that many saw it.  Even after they removed gating and gave gear upgrades, those raids weren't easy.
---
If you're speed leveling you shouldn't do anything other than AOE farm instances in a group. Also none of that gear is hard to get because tailors spam them to level. There will be dozens of people shitting out azure silk gear on launch because that is basically the easiest way to level tailoring.
---
It's also not hard to get to the breaking point where you use less frostbolts. My 38 mage kills lvl 37 ogre mages in three frostbolts and sometimes even 2 if one crits.
---
Cause blood and thunder mostly.  That's hard to compete with.
---
It wasn‚Äôt suppose to be that deep of a comment :)
---
Makes sense
---
i mean its smart : give every  streamer beta and you have free advertisement
---
other developers pay thousands of dollars to single streamer to play their game
---
If you're going to do two characters, you'd be better off with a Hunter alt to grind the 100g per week for respecs, which would only take an hour or two.
---
I don't really mind stupid names as long as people have an RP addon with a normal one.
---
You can pick up the flight path in WPL, follow the road to the bridge before Andorhal, go in the water swim across to the mountains on the left, hug the mountain, get to the Bulwark, where as far as I remember were no guards but even if you die there it's much faster than running from Southshore.
---
I'm not sure what you doubt.  It's pretty much universally agreed upon that Engi is the best prof in vanilla gameplay wise.  It won't make you any money, so if that is your goal, then gathering and the other crafting profs (especially alch) are where the money is.
---
Not even close to true. A single methyl group can increase bioavailability by orders of magnitude.
---
Omg can you do this with Bloodfang Armor
---
Nobody has been saying streamers don't get priority for beta invites.
---
I don‚Äôt remember item levels being listed
---
But when you gotta field 40 ppl sometimes a bad apple is better than no apple
---
The scores on the last one...I love those BG's.
---
The screenshot of the sword and the bag is from yesterday. Been in my bank for 12 years.
---
i don't need to play 1-60 twice in one year (and not even get to keep one lol)
---
first and foremost you won't get a raidspot as ret sorry, ret palas are just that trash in vanilla
---
That fucking title
---
[deleted]
---
Remember that in vanilla, you have all the basic abilities, as well as defensive stance.  You can spec mostly arms/fury and just slap on sword and board and switch to defensive stance to tank.
---
Finding some stance dance macros make life a lot easier as a vanilla warrior.
---
I feel like this wouldn‚Äôt really add much and it would just drain the paladins mana more? And it‚Äôs also only for ret, probably still in but meh
---
Blizzard spent a whole 5 minutes of the Blizzcon Classic talk explaining how they got just the right color of the lamps in Westfall back to their original blinding white.
---
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that if this can be fixed, it will be. It‚Äôs been reported within the beta a ton.
---
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch, you better think about that baybay
---
I‚Äôm just reporting these streamer whining posts as spam so I can block the poster.
---
or you can play on a server where neither of those exist?
---
You've just made a post about abusing the server.
---
Autists here think way too much about streamers, they don't even have that much of an effect on the beta for the regular players, you can simply ignore their events and that's all the big streamers on one low pop server.
---
When classic launches it will be incredibly easy to just go to a server with no big streamers and just enjoy the game. Smaller and less autistic streamers could even be fun if they organize some events.
---
How can you start at 8 -9? Which is it
---
I'm in the beta and yeah, I have to essentially force myself not to play too much because I don't want to get burned out or anything. Very hard because it really is as fun as it was back in 2004. Bring on that release!
---
The discovery only become well known pretty late into TBC, is there any evidence that it was possible in Vanilla?
---
Hell yeah man, thanks so much for this!
---
Since Blizzard considers phase 2 a minor phase (and plans to release it shortly after launch), there‚Äôs also a good argument that MC will have all of its pre-BWL loot on launch.
---
Besides Enchanting? I don‚Äôt believe you.
---
Mulgore is good looking, the Tauren are not :)
---
Holds aggro better than a Feral nonetheless
---
You have more keys to reach with the pinky. WASD is at the end of the keyboard.
---
I‚Äôm surprised by the under-representation of warlocks but the amount of druids is consistent with my expectations. Otherwise pretty even distribution. I‚Äôm curious where the class concentration will be upon release.
---
No wonder no one can get AB games. Dead server...
---
Says he‚Äôs led raiding guilds for every expansion since WotLK.
---
Doesn‚Äôt consider himself a Retail player.
---
Yeah, okay bud.
---
Yet, everything you wrote is horse shit.
---
I disagree. I'm into PvP, so Mana wouldn't be a big issue and it would definitely be impactful. It's nuances like that that make a class more fun to play imo.
---
Thing is for me the buttons adjacent to walking backwards (S or D) are turn, and those close to forwards are strafe. So using the inverted version becomes obvious and natural, since you should never turn in WoW using keys anyway.
---
I love how even though it should have been impossible to get there and never being seen, they still put in those construction barricades
---
Here I am torn between druid and warlock... apparently I'm part of the few either way.
---
Watch the video...
---
He did, the buyback had refreshed.
---
Well I like Dwarves but I'd say in Vanilla they are also not good looking lol
---
It gives 20% now according to the wiki. Maybe a different bug? (rep should be 10% when it is giving 20% on beta)
---
&gt;comfortable having a split built that isn't optimal in either?
---
Yes I am. Part of classic was that your build was part of your character. Not everyone needs to be BiS spec at every encounter, the content wasnt designed to be taken on exclusively by people with the perfect talents for it.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zAcMqZZVcIz0xo
---
Party regardless but range is fairly short
---
You said you plan to play casually, which basically excludes every raid except late-phase PUG MCs. You‚Äôll be able to tank all the content reasonably available to you.
---
I've seen people claim that it was in as early as 1.11. It's not clear though and I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't in classic now.
---
Yea man you can‚Äôt let that move in date get too deep into August!
---
source on &gt;considers phase 2 a minor phase (and plans to release it shortly after launch)
---
?
---
I mean, just do the quests. They're all really cool, fun and interesting. Remember, this isn't going to feel like WoW Classic since Cata happened and the whole starter world has been reworked. Try out the quests and ignore the dungeons if you truly want to scratch the itch. Plenty of people talk from what I found but you're going through unpopulated zones unfortunately. If you're not finding people in your zones that talk, find a guild to talk with. There should be plenty that are just social guilds that you can join. Remember, there's 1-120 worth of zones that people are spread through and they lowered the XP requirements for a lot of the start so people progress through it fast.
---
This is good to hear, thanks for the heads up!
---
Awesome job
---
Ones opinion doesnt mate it concreate
---
Tremendously detailed and helpful. I've forgotten so much since I last played WoW in the old days. Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs very possible that there will only be a few servers of each type per region. That‚Äôs the entire point of Layering.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt have to avoid streamers any more than they should have to avoid us.
---
Closing typically takes 30-45 days around here so as long as we find something fast enough we should be golden. 
---
When we looked for our last house we were searching for two months and looked at over 20 houses though.
---
they probably shoulda paid 'em to make sure they don't talk bad about retail as they often do
---
I PvPd a lot as Reck/Ret and i dont ever remember full or partial resists, i remember parrys/dodges.
---
Also, i never read this anywhere, but im 99% sure the holy damage had 100% armor penetration, hence why they made it 70% damage. The reason i remember this is because it did a lot more damage than your white hits on Plate and a lot less than your white hits on Cloth.
---
Consistent with private servers too. Recruiting Warlocks was a bitch.
---
GW2 combat was better but GW1 had some of the best lore ever. It was just so encapsulating of a world. FACTIONS made me love asian history, NIGHTFALL made me love desert which made my deployments much cooler
---
That OG water was good. Personally I‚Äôll use the classic graphics with some minor updates. Fair shadows so the landscape still has the classic feel but better character shadows. Fair water so it doesn‚Äôt have reflections  but has the updated textures and I‚Äôll increase all object distances including grass up til 7 or 8 which keeps classic density  but increases the distance without adding the physics.
---
That's my point... not being equal... if you have more skill than your opponent then you aren't equal.
---
This is false. By 1.12, every trainer except the starting zone ones could teach all levels of all professions.
---
Are you enjoying it?
---
I‚Äôm going to play alliance because I feel like horde is going to be way over populated haha
---
I like my coffee black...
---
Like my men.
---
&gt;I was tauren over this myself for a while.
---
I see what you did there, and I liked it.
---
I want to play an MMORPG, not an MMORNG.
---
Professions are a good way to make money and it‚Äôs easier to level the gathering ones (herbalism, mining, skinning) as you level, otherwise you have to backtrack.
---
Is the buyback tab exclusive to the NPC you sold stuff to or can you buy back the same item from any vendor?
---
Because for every 1 person who will nod and agree with you, you'll find 2 who will scream, reeee, and be offended by it.
---
Weekend raiding, dawg.  I just can't do that "We raid every Tuesday promptly upon reset" thing anymore.
---
Get help.
---
Just get a gaming mouse I‚Äôd say, changing all your keys around is all well and good - but pretty much just a waste when a 50 dollar mouse will be infinitely more useful to you.
---
AHing leather is better than censoring I feel
---
Iv seen people with bfa only accounts claim to get one so idk
---
I saw him get summoned earlier this week on retail. We were holding the Alliance at the IB chokepoint for 30+ minutes and then they managed to summon him. Seeing him and the Alliance march across the midfield towards us was actually quite cool, took a few screenshots of it
---
Remember when player corpses could be looted for greys? I still have a severed nightelf head on my shaman.
---
Ahhhhhh. Good eye. I didn't even realize that.
---
Haha near similar story for me. NE rogue till 60, then horde for years and years after. Teldrassil and Darkshore are two of my favorite places.
---
As the Mortar Team from WC3 woud say: You've made the right choice.
---
Top quality shitpost
---
I had a bunch of characters that were abandoned around level 30 for that reason. I got lucky rolling shaman and having it agree with me while simultaneously meeting 2 other people that I rended up regularly playing work and or chatting with on Vent. This helped me power through 30 and onward to 60. 
---
I imagine there were tons of people that never made it beyond that milestone since it took me 5 tries before I could.
---
Shadow priest...
---
I really wanna go alli but don‚Äôt want dwarf (Ik fear ward is op but I want a basic NE/human) 
---
And undead looks sick but I don‚Äôt want to stay horde 
---
Choices...
---
That's my personal favorite as I mained human but I've gotta give credit where it's due and Mulgore is clearly the best. That's just a fact like how "More than a feeling" by Boston is the greatest song of all time.
---
Nice
---
0/30/21 works in AQ40, I ran it as I was an off tank for trash and a couple of bosses.  My guild was one that ignored the stigma about druid tanks, it was great because they made it a priority to keep my tank set up to snuff.
---
And wouldn't you be?
---
Really? I was gonna go NE or human because the look but I was tearing myself up because I want fear ward but not a stumpy lad. 
---
(Was a dwarf hunter on vanilla, I just don‚Äôt like dresses on them)

meats vendor for shit silver, food becomes expensive at the higher levels, if u can just cook you'll save yourself a lot of money, especially good for warrior and rogue.

I don't fully agree with your opinion but it certainly won't be as good as it was back then, gaming, and the people who game are vastly different from 15 years ago. The times and people change and this will reflect on the new community.
---
Yes but a guild has 40-50 people who might show yo to a world boss, often times much less than that because of the odd times they spawn. Streamer guilds will have hundreds of players at world bosses.
---
Wrong. Methylphenidate is Ritalin. Adderall is a mix of amphetamine salts Levoamphetamine and Dextroapmhetamine.
---
Meth is methamphetamine which lasts waaaaaaay longer and is more toxic at higher doses and is methylated so it has SERT activity which causes more problems than normal amphetamine.
---
Methylphenidate isn't even an amphetamine. It's more related to straight phenythylamine and pipirdine.
---
Stop spreading your ignorance.

SplintertP does not sound fun

Necrophilia

So cool!!!!
---
Mulgore is actually my favorite starting zone
---
Not that rare, but I still have my Eternal Quintessence and Drakefire Amulet.
---
Nah, explain which seals you would twist to make a meaningful impact. I played paladin all vanilla and it was deemed not worth it very early on.
---
You could twist righteousness and command for a extra 90 damage (if you got it the exact time), you could do light or wisdom for a bit of mana or hp, but all the gains are so low because using a 2hand your attack speed is usually over 3.
---
1hand the CD timer screws you over most times and then you can‚Äôt be using judgements or else twisting has even less effect.
---
I‚Äôm all ears on your idea though?
---
It‚Äôs unlikely any hardcore guild that deserves the title is going to spend 4 hours doing any sort of raiding.
---
MC+Ony can be done in less than an hour and the rest of the raids can be done in under 2. And we‚Äôre not talking uber speedruns here, these are double the times of actual speedruns.
---
Druid will let you tank every 5-man, all of MC, and depending on how hard you go on min/maxing and preparation, almost every other boss in the game. Is it likely that a guild will want a Druid MT for progression raids? Probably not, but they make fine OTs and alt-run leaders.
---
For everything else, you can heal.
---
I only suggest this because Druid is already on your list. It‚Äôs personally my least favorite class (on Horde).
---
That's a good idea
---
What I meant to say was that -somebody- is going to be dominant, whether it's a hardcore guild or a streamer guild. So for 99% of the playerbase it's probably not going to matter that much, because you're only really going to get to fight that world boss if you are in the dominant guild anyway.
---
Exactly how I feel, I love the horde and never did any Ally content. Stopped playing mid Cata, none of my buds are gonna come back so I‚Äôm thinking I might try Ally this time üßê
---
Ah, I didn't notice OP thinks anything but gathering professions is a solid source of income.
---
The more fanbois post things like this the more people will complain so can we just drop the whole subject so we can move on with more important stuff
---
Writing a rant about streamers takes more effort than ‚Äúmemes‚Äù like this. They are also more entertaining to look at tbh.
---
I was going to come here and say the exact same thing, and doubley reinforce the importance of water!!
---
You should be drinking AT LEAST 90 fl oz a day. I recommend drinking more. Helps with digestion, headaches, eyesight, brain processes, muscle fatigue, and almost literally everything else!
---
Probably the same time per zone on that day
---
Why is that?

*Plumber voice:* Well, there's your problem.

Same. I fully expect some chest pain when launch week is all over and done... lol

If a dead person was banging my dead body? I‚Äôd be dead so probably not. Unless I was undead, the. I‚Äôd probably be into it.

MadSeason rules. This guy makes such consistently helpful videos on classic, and his stream is great.
---
Hell yeah. All 4 of my 60s in classic dinged in or around the yeti cave. Love me some winterspring!
---
I'm also going gnome mage in classic. Was an undead mage back in vanilla. Will you be doing the same again or going for something new this time?
---
I have a Spellstone on my Warlock still
---
If he can get someone to 20% he could have finished it with more time.
---
Yeah, I agree. Most polls I've seen show warlocks in the Top 3 or 4, but the real distribution seems quite a bit lower. As a long-time warlock player, I'm happy that I will be a bit more rare than the polls originally showed. I think a lot of people want to blitz to 60 when the gates open and because warlocks are pretty good levelers, it led a lot of people to plan to play warlocks, but something must be deterring them from sticking with it in the be

Why would her eyes be closed? If you die with your eyes open they will remain open as your muscles no longer work to close them.

Wait, didnt they say they WERENT going to fix those lamps as they weren't of high enough prio?
---
4:3 master race! Haha, I'm so happy to be able to play 21:9 now, even though I loved my old CRT monitor.
---
You should make paladin/shaman the same vote since they are faction specific.
---
DM runs
---
Locks are good for solo content and WPvP but lack a good gold-farming method and lack speed-running lowbie dungeons
---
Rock elemental for the horde side. Lead to some battles bottlenecked at the bridge near ally side or by the gy near Galv.
---
Lmao, this passive-agressive CV and job hunting
---
We had 5 shamans in that raid
---
It's something that I think would add nuance and fun experimentation. 
---
With something like libram of fervor you can SoC into SotC, and that's not wimpy by any means. SoJ is also an option. 
---
I'm not saying this will be a staple to paladins if it's in the game, but it's something fun to play with. And there's tons of PvP scenarios where you wouldn't mind dumping Mana into seals - Going offensive or trying to finish someone.
---
I'm talking about organizing server wide grief.  I am sure there response won't be the same now as it was in vanilla but in vanilla days (I know that not every GM is the same but) the GMs did not give a shit about any of this, they thought it was funny.  We used to charge a toll to cross a bridge and if people didn't pay we'd have members of the opposing faction pop out of hiding and kill them.  In WotLK our server first 80 priest only won because he had assassins on both factions ganking and camping any other priests on the server within a level of him.
---
I leveled more than that in AV from what I remember. Just kept grinding mobs and turning in the repeatable stuff.
---
I'm pretty sure the images for the archived guides were removed from the server at some point.
---
Only if the player acts like an NPC, in which case, does it really count?
---
Appreciate the info dude! It‚Äôs awesome Blizzard actually commented and confirmed, I‚Äôm ready for August.
---
Dude the threads have been FULL of people bitching about streamers. It's legitimately impressive that you haven't seen anything about streamers. Search the word streamer for the past month and see how many posts you get.
---
14? LOL I was 30 when I played Vanilla
---
You'd make a killing if you did commissions, do you?
---
Your game is so square. That's how you really know its legit
---
Oh man, I was looking for dark blue. I forgot we were pink in vanilla.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1191
---
Link to the set in question?
---
Just make sure you find fun people to raid with. The raids are mostly boring compared to later expansions, especially the first two.
---
We would probably just see a 15 second paint-written image saying something like "I got beta".
---
This is really not helping my dilemma between (healing) Priest and Warlock.
---
How *dare* you post a 2.0 screenshot in here
---
Wow those legs look goofy
---
I had that phantom blade on my hunter!! That alone takes me back to 2007
---
IIRC Horde tends to swing a bit older, which might explain some things. But there is definitely good and bad eggs in both factions.
---
Hi, /u/dmitriya
---
Rogues can do a lot of cool soloing, especially in BRD. That Dark Iron Ore farm is great.
---
We wiped so many times. It took weeks of planning to get him. Nothing has ever come close in terms of gameplay for me since
---
Ganks someone 4 levels below. Typical.
---
And I'm pretty sure our first Hand of Rag went to a shaman
---
Hm.... maybe just limit that 2nd table to just "non high streamer impact" servers? Might make it easier. I would think most people care about avoiding the high impact the most.
---
To be honest, what you have already done is awesome in it's own right!
---
Flash bombs.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. My brother was a clicker in vanilla. He raided naxx up to KT when it was still current and had 3 pieces t3.
---
Well if you have a guild supporting you, you can play pretty much any spec.
---
Hey, thanks, could you explain why those talents and overall what this build does and how it‚Äôs supposed to perform?
---
Well shit,nas alliance I'd always heard the grass was greener on the green side.  I mostly solo anyway.
---
Cheers man. Didn't mean to be rude or anything. Take care :)
---
In Soviet Undercity, corpse fuck you?
---
Never got into watching summit but his wow streams are good, will probably watch when classic launches.
---
Yeah
---
IMO warlock tends to get an uptick as PvP starts getting going, so I'd expect more people to roll Warlocks as alts.
---
That said, as far as raids go, I don't know if Warlocks will perform as well as they do on pservers with most guilds not bothering with the meta on trivial raids enough to bring a dedicated Nightfall / SPriest.
---
Goddamn this thing is peak ugly.
---
Quit.
---
How many grams of sugar? They load most yogurts
---
I had an incredibly well geared druid due to being a premier raiding guild, and I very much enjoyed pvping, so I can give some authority on this manner.  I found my druid pretty much crap compared to a similarly geared priest/paladin until around full T2. After full T2 with various green dragon/AQ40/etc non-set pieces, I found druid to be undeniably powerful, and well beyond that of similarly geared pala/priests.
---
Just like in PvE, resto druids simply scale better than their counterparts once a certain gear threshold is reached. Until then though, you are quite literally outclassed.
---
where in my post did you get the impression that i want to quit you mongoloid
---
I still have a severed night elf head from vanilla av.
---
That makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.
---
Deep prot paladin can 2man full clear BRD or solo all the bosses in the arena, kill most of the trash in DM:E, so like farm dem runes or books, there is quite a lot of things. Deep prot can do red quests as well...  
---
If you want a safer option jus go mage/hunter as they are the easiest to learn how to farm gold and stuff, pvp with them is harder (skill wise) but they overall strong...if you put some time you can do some really nasty plays.
---
Appreciate it, if they are going through that much work to fix the lamp, seems really unlikely they wont fix the animation.
---
Seems like I had a good amount of T1, a BF hood, looks like Vis'kag, and a CHT. Can anybody ID the boots?
---
Rogue at 15 is probably the most underpowered thing in the game. Use a ranged wep to make sure you only pull one at a time.
---
He has ZG items and pots, so no.
---
Cool painting but why is it angled?
---
Love Madseason.
---
i do but in the fucking zone im leveling in sometimes it just randomly pulls another one and if i dont have my sprint off cd i just die. also idk what to do when they start running at another mob. i try to position myself so they run away from mobs but sometimes its really fucking difficult
---
I think it's eu

Yup, I did. I have no idea how I missed them either.

The shield sold from the gold shire vendor is 151 armor if I‚Äôm correct. Worth the upgrade

I remember having that one issue of PC Gamer with the huge featurette about WoW. Remember reading that bad boy front to back over and over. Highschool me was so hyped.

ZG trinket is the only ZG item. Also using AB staff.

You're able to achieve the spell damage in Phase 1 that gives you these crits.
---
We have come full circle.
---
git gud
---
One of the few good things to come out of Cataclysm; Dwarves could be every class worth being.
---
Still a shame that the Dwarf mages of beta did not make it into the original launch of the game.
---
Only need a large stam pool if you get hit. Take the cloth drops and make gear with tailoring
---
Wow Classic is like getting to lose your virginity all over again except this time you won't suck and blow your load in the first minute.
---
I see some TBC screenshots as well :p isn't that the netherwing cave one some of those?
---
I just got cancer.
---
Same here. I would rather expend my limited WoW energy on something that will matter. Beta ends and all that progress will go away. Release Classic will be here, if not forever, for a very long time, hopefully.
---
Yep, as alliance I grab the staff from the red crystal quest in darkshore and use that until I get an upgrade from deadmines, which could be the Staff of Westfall if smite's hammer doesn't drop.
---
Most warriors dont make it to 60. A large portion of the ones that do want to be DPS because it's very good
---
There is always a need for tanks
---
I love seeing pictures of video cards as they‚Äôre slowly dying. So many cool things happen.
---
Some cooking recipes are very cheap and easy with mats you'll naturally acquire, and creating them increases the sell price beyond what just selling the mats would get. So you spend a little time to cook and you may double the value of the mats alone.
---
Stress test: people needing 40 minutes to complete the cactus quest.
---
the dark iron dwarves were not yet freed from Ragnaros' rule and weren't part of the alliance. being the only magical dwarves, so it makes sense. 
---
But I agree, woulda been nice.
---
I'm surprised at how many people fall into this category of having never actually played WoW at L60 before. It means a lot of the comments on this subreddit should be taken with a huge grain of salt knowing that folks were just 6-13 when playing Vanilla, if they even played at all.
---
Myself and most of the folks I talk to who actively raided through Naxx back in the day have much different opinions than /r/classicwow.
---
Hmm?
---
You're supposed to bring a warlock and another friend. Water breathing buffs for all of you.  
---
Then you swim to the bottom of the well and start summoning people.
---
only before 40 if you go with imp overpower for leveling (dual wield gets lots of overpower procs), as level 40 you get mortal strike and it is stronger and more helpful in pvp, don't forget, with a slow 2 hander because you are not looking at DPS but min-max damage as mortal strike is a instant cast.  
---
Other than that you will be going fury warrior if you are dps in a raid at level 60 and only then you will get enough %hit so you cannot miss yellow hits (skills)
---
I have NO numbers to back this up, but I feel like there are more pvp-warlocks on horde.
---
And IMO thats not only because of WotF, but also because of shamans who are - between earth shocks, purges and grounding - a very disruptive class wether they play egoistically or teamorientated (a very important distinction in PUGs, where a egoistic retri wont put up as much pressure).
---
Hit 60 as fast as you can and you‚Äôll be picked up in some forming guilds.
---
rogues are garbage at solo leveling though
---
Perfect. The 10% of your server that is private server veterans with years of experience will be 60, and you‚Äôll be ahead of all the normal people. Probably a great spot to be in TBH
---
Wait were mounts really lowered to 30 in TBC and 20 in Wrath? I don‚Äôt remember that at all.
---
If y'all REALLY wanna know all about early development, check out the WoW Diary by John Staats. Also known as "whenitsready". Its an AMAZING read

Here's a video series where a hunter does it in about 80-hours:

/Moo... all I can say

Was your monitor small back then. I used to have a tiny raid window till I upgraded to a larger monitor and I barely needed change the ui  to get heaps more space
---
/nod
---
&gt;Druids need to farm ridiculous amounts of consumables
---
&gt;Farm weapons with charges?
---
&gt;Use a level 40 blue helm until TBC
---
All of it is true. I've played Feral on a PS and it was the most stressful experience I've had in WoW. When you're feral you need to work twice as hard for your raid spot, and work 50% harder than everybody else to keep it.
---
In total, around 35 hours of my time each week went into farming manual crowd pummelers, raid consumables and prepping for raid by getting stuff like world buffs and repeatable quest rewards. Crowd pummelers add a lot of wasted time each week because you clear 5 instances per hour and then you have about 20 minutes of downtime between instance lockouts spent doing nothing. There is no ceiling to how many MCPs you can spend each raid and it all depends on how many you're willing to farm each week. Most people settle for one MCP per boss but you could in theory spend dozens each raid. And then you're often expected to come tank dungeons for guildies every week. There's never enough tanks, and you're one of them.
---
A lot of people are going into classic with an underdog mentality, thinking they have what it takes to make these specs work and I'll show them how wrong they were... and they're going to discover that classic is really just about time investment. You can make feral, ret, enhancement etc. work, it's very simple. You just put in twice as many hours as the next guy and what do you know, the spec kinda works.
---
I say kinda because you're going to be middle of the pack in terms of DPS and it'll stay that way. You'll probably always be a second class citizen, passed on for gear upgrades because the same ring that adds 90 DPS to your class ends up adding 150 DPS to another class. That ring they gave to that Rogue allowed him to replace some off-set gear and wear tier instead which unlocked a set bonus and now his DPS is 15% higher from one gear upgrade.
---
Speaking from personal experience, if you have any doubts going into it I would not recommend any of the off-meta specs. It's stressful, often thankless and definitely underwhelming.
---
Wonderful spell batching.

People often forget the downvote button is not supposed to be used when you disagree with someone's opinions.

So thank you for contributing to the discussion with some interesting counter points! I have upvoted you and hope others do the same for your thoughtful comment.

this guy is on some shit
---
I want it to be as new as possible for me, plus the idea of losing progress in beta is going to affect my hype for the game. I do watch some streams just to see what is going on but I want to only actually play when it launches.
---
What is your definition of ganking, exactly? corpse camping is not bannable and ganking by definition is harassment/griefing.
---
But dwarf priests are the most aesthetic priests.
---
&gt;  I think the story that starts in Elwynn is very interesting and super exciting
---
Literally the first 10 seconds of the video:
---
&gt;The story in Elwynn is not very complicated and honestly, not super exciting
---
WHICH IS IT CHIEF???
---
The color-schemed used is more more aligned with mages, yes. But a lot of the actual items in it are more warlock.
---
Your best bet is going to be positioning yourself as a highly-skilled well-geared friendly and popular dungeon tank and find newly forming guilds that don't have the position filled. No one is going to be able to tell you if that situation will ever occur on your server. You seem to already grasp that you're going for the single most rare position a guild ever needs.
---
Two Flawless Arcanite Rifles, one on my Horde hunter and the other on my Alliance hunter. After all the work leveling engineering on these two, and the gathering all the mat‚Äôs to make them, I couldn‚Äôt vendor them. Besides, they look soo cool.
---
Two options: grind mobs to get a few levels OR leave current zone and head to an alternative questing zone. You'll have 3 areas from each faction to level up in and it might be a nice refresher to change your environment.
---
Oh man I dont even remember, but I'm sure it wasn't huge. I was very budget back then. Usually only getting hand me down upgrades for my pc when my friends got the good stuff.
---
HAHAHAHAHA Freakin awesome. Yea maybe I wasn't so clear in the post here. The story that "STARTS" in Elwynn - meaning the storyline of the Dark Brotherhood. The story of Elwynn itself isn't too much to write home about, but what starts there is pretty awesome. I'll keep that in mind in the next few vids hahahahah. Thanks

A lot of people have played private servers for years, so it's understandable that many folks don't need to slow down and enjoy it again. To each his own, whether that is playing leisurely or min/maxing.
---
Do you have any hard CC at lvl 15? If not, try just grinding a few more levels somewhere else. Takes a while, but eventually the few extra levels help you through the zone.
---
how so?
---
I have Rank 2, 3 points max blizzard, but keep dying to lack of stam
---
My plan is, even if it is slow. Is to tank my way up trying to gain connections with people as I go. And hopefully while I do that, I can manage to find a guilds interest early on.
---
Considering you can't abuse /camp like you can on Pservers, your lasher runs just got a lot more inefficient
---
They can matter sometimes and sometimes not, depends on which team has more braindeads.
---
Haha I just want to say, ‚Äúbologna‚Äù is the food and ‚Äúbaloney‚Äù means nonsense :)
---
i was part of it and i level from 1 to 5 in 55 minutes
---
Isn't the formula for early game warrior more like: weapon dps full stop?
---
If two mobs are too close, stealth up and sap one then kill the other before going back to the first. 
---
Othwerwise just be more careful with your pulls and gouge when enemies are about to run away to give you time to get some energy up to finish them.
---
If you're having trouble on pservers you're screwed for classic, much harder.
---
D...d...did we play the same vanilla? Paladins are the most mana efficient healers in the game. Buffs last longer than 5 mins. Priests have a better time soloing things.
---
Get your shit together fam. I don‚Äôt main a Tauren but fuck is their starting zone the best!!!
---
Yeah, everything is so over the top now. The tier sets in classic all looked badass without making you look like some anime demigod.
---
His favourite steamer calls for bans against pvping on a pvp server. 
---
Guyz itz the subredditz fault!!
---
Is there an add on for this? I‚Äôm dumb and do this way too much and can‚Äôt get it back from buyback.
---
2 Dwarf Priests, 3 Human Warriors, and 5 Gnome Mages.  
---
Nothing else is BiS permissable and you will be kicked and reported to the BiS central authority for blasphemy.
---
Awesome video. One of my favorite things about WoW are those moments. When I watch boss fight videos I can't wait to here the nerdgasms that go down.
---
&gt;I'll be shipping the wife and kid away for a week
---
&gt;Hoping to find some like minded singles in my area
---
Why do you want to main tank? Why not off tank? If you join a guild as a off tank and are always available you will be #2 tank and when the MT can‚Äôt make the raid you are in.
---
Not too hard
---
Rat dies.
---
Play retail
---
Yes.
---
A "gank" is when a player has an advantage due to level and kills the opposing player or when a group of players kills a single player.
---
When a level disadvantage is non-existent and it's 1v1 it's PvP.
---
Ganking is part of the game. No big.
---
Human Warlock. Gear fits the best in them. A fun and varied class that people want to have around. Free 40 mount (cheaper 60 mount). Alt will be Nelf Priest so I can have a character of a different role just in case.
---
Actually a terrible post full of opinions and literally the most generic shallow views that I‚Äôve heard streamers regurgitate multiple times. Good luck with classic bro but it‚Äôs probably nothing like you‚Äôre expecting it to be.
---
I think being on the cutting edge is a kind of unique experience. You can get to rares before they're despawned due to competition, you can experience weird situations like being in stv without a legion of higher level players ready to kill you for breathing, the first person to level herbalism high enough will make a killing on black lotuses, that sort of thing. It seems like a really neat opportunity, whereas leveling slowly and thoroughly can always be done with alts.
---
Hey. HEY! Listen up buddy: There are no female dwarves - and if there were any, then we wouldn't talk about them.
---
What do you think *why* dwarves had to resort to heavy alcoholism? 
---
Or why their priests - who presumably are tasked with marrying people - have the ability to buff fear ward in order to prevent the broom from running of in terror?
---
So once again - repeat after me: There. are .NO. female. dwarves.
---
Either way would work, just greed I guess from wanting to get geared up first. Would rather have first chance at gear then the hand me downs later on.
---
I played lock hordeside on a private server and cleared through BWL. While I preferred playing horde side in pvp, dealing with threat issues while raiding, let alone the hit issues, made it pretty frustrating to play. It seemed like most guilds prioritized their shams in melee groups over lock groups, so there never was any threat reduction. 
---
Loved wotf and cannibalize (esp. for leveling) though.
---
‚ÄúA vet POV‚Äù. Cringed so hard. This is bad bro
---
I will slay many of your kind, orc.
---
They nerfed the shit out of AV in TBC and beyond. Its literally not even enjoyable anymore.
---
I scrolled this far to agree that you should do the quests 110-120 if you have an itch. I did them and then shortly afterwards fell out of the game.
---
But the quests, at least hordeside, are great.
---
Then you have to put in the time and dedication, main tanks get spoon fed gear and respect for a reason....they are on 24/7.
---
If you can‚Äôt commit then you won‚Äôt get a main tank spot, there will always be someone with more commitment
---
I disagree. I raided for a few months in BFA and have to say, Shadow Priests, Enhancement Shaman, and Demonology Warlocks were *seriously* under-performing, and would be asked to respec or just not be accepted by groups serious about progressing.
---
The problem was even more apparent with pushing high keys in Mythic+; the group makeups were overwhelmingly similar.
---
hurrr durr still need to buff moonkin they are garbage \s
---
I wouldn't call them garbage. They're not the best, not the worst, but on a PVP server they have quite the advantage.
---
This is definitely an aspect ratio/resolution issue. The only thing here that's a questionable inclusion is the second chat window for the combat log, but you'd normally have DPS/Threat meters there anyways.
---
don't pull 2 mobs at the time.
---
Ahh yeh the famous #nochangesexceptthe1thingweshouldchange movement. Very popular.
---
how long did this take you to come up with
---
There is nothing to think about. Go Dwarf. Go Female. Achieve Nirvana.
---
I feel bad because I'm not finding any bugs. Got one level 12 and a few level 5s to try out the classes.
---
yup, and it looks like it'll continue to be just a memory with the post-npc nerf AV
---
+ an egoistic shaman is still annoying  and disruptive to an ally warlock with shocks, purge, grounding. 
---
Meanwhile an egoistic retri that does not look after his team is a blessing for the horde wl.
---
keyword is egoistic, teamplay changes a lot - as you said yourself.

Absolutely. 100%.

[NOOOOOO Ma'am!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp1T-hsnaM0)
---
Thank you for expressing in simple terms what I was trying to say, I agree fully
---
A minimum of one druid is mandatory for mark of the wild and Nefarian's class call.
---
Horde wants shamans x infinity and druids are usually the first to be put on the chopping block. I've seen high end guilds on both factions bring only one for MotW.
---
The less than super-hardcore guilds will probably end up bringing 2 or 3 per raid.
---
Will druid satisfy my loot whore desires?  I want low competition for the loots.
---
Bro I saw you screenshot this earlier today
---
Looks like an rp server
---
I've said this before, I'll say it again and again. 
---
#Tank is a role in a raid.
---
#Main Tank is a role in a guild.
---
Find a guild that you fit in well with, and tank for them. It's up to them to make you their main tank - its not up to you. You don't just apply to be a MT of a guild, there's a ton of trust and responsibility there, that you don't just spam trade chat for.
---
this is a cursed imagine
---
How do you figure? I‚Äôm in beta and private and the damage you take on pservers is much higher.
---
But that has nothing to do woth "using mechanics". That has to do with having enough healing and dmg to trivialise fight
---
That's my plan. I am even going to have a herb/alch alt to feed him potions and flasks or at least be able to give someone else the mats if i don't have the recipe to make them.
---
Here's a bit of critical thinking and logic being applied to the OP's post with some knowledge of raiding and running a guild and the game not being out or guild assembled.
---
8-9 as a start time.
---
Means: when I've assembled a guild that is OK with starting at night around this time - we will iron it out.
---
(Throws glitter in the air)
---
MAGIC!
---
It is:)
---
nice catch!
---
Based on the fact that it's August 13 for Europe and August 12 for US, the earliest time it can be for US is 3PM PDT.
---
You should do this over a week or so at different times a day and compile an excel doc with averages and shit if you wanna go the extra mile
---
Remove tbc arenas and rework flying somehow. Bam.
---
It looks like you dragged it off a homeless person
---
I don't think this is an unpopular opinion, just an unfortunate one.
---
Group with another lvl15 rogue... or that poor bastard wanding things to death, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd love it.
---
Tofu vanilla.
---
I'm on a boat? Yeah I started in BC too.
---
Thinking I'm in a dilemma.  
---
Originally was going night elf resto druid. 
---
Now considering night elf priest or male human holy paladin.  
---
Or do I just want to go warrior and hope I can a tanking slot in raids
---
fuck yeah bonechewer represent

---
Standard Resto FC.
---
Yeah watching streamers and checking this sub has dragged out the wait substantially for me. That‚Äôs why I plan to check this sub even more and watch at least 2 or 3 classic streamers at the same time so I can be immortal. Time will just never move forward for me.
---
If the past is a bench mark he'll stand in fire and die every geddon/gehennas/rag. Can't wait .
---
I really want to know what madseason looks like. Not entirely sure why but I'm curious lol
---
I don't think Joana's guide will be viable at launch if you're in for speedleveling. There are just far too many people that are going to do it.
---
Who woulda know 18 years later and you are hyped for the same game....
---
Do you not see how fucking stupid you sound? Because one person is being followed by tons of people that effects you how? The stupidity behind your reasoning is just too fucking funny. And i didn't distort anything what so ever. And then the scarab lord he brings up... Like lmfao just because a streamer isn't on a server you think you'll get it?!?! haha fucking fat chance.
---
For speed leveling sure, but I want that authentic experience.
---
Even if it does I promise you there will be no instance in where it will help you hold threat.  The regen is so negligible that it will never come into factor
---
Oh fuck.  I was almost 40.  God, I'm old.
---
I watched part 1 and was so sad that he broke it into two parts because I was waiting for the priest specific portion. I was checking YouTube everyday the last week hoping he would upload, it's hard to make me care about a video that much and I really appreciate his videos. Respect.
---
All those things don't happen because of streamers... You're giving them too much credit. That shit happens regardless
---
/u/TB12GOAT78 's post as a TL;DR: 
---
&gt; Hardcore "we want to get world first" or "we want to break speedkill records" will want to take engineering for the *minimal* dps increase it grants over the other professions. It is called *Min*Maxing for a reason.
---
Maybe he could have worded it a bit better, but the general point definitly stands.
---
Read his history people. Trolling alt account.
---
I would suggest not taking Adderall until you get out of the starting zones
---
I forgot about sjnestra and council.
---
All I remember from vanilla was dual weild at 10 and polearm at 20.
---
Fair enough, I was mostly just curious because no one ever talked about it. I guess that would be why if its so low.
---
all the world record speedruns are like 20-25 warriors???
---
Then tbh start your own guild. It's pretty hard to just "become" the main tank of an established guild. Few main tanks will willingly relinquish that title, except through sheer luck.
---
Either join a small guild and become a staple member (and the staple warrior) while leveling, or make your own guild.
---
Is he the voice of Terenas Menethil?
---
Except you won't have the crit to take advantage of it, or the stam to survive, or the mana to do it more than once.
---
Perhaps, but I think the current consensus is that on a fresh server, supply will massively exceed demand, and because the vendor price of leather is so high, it will have very high auction house commissions. So maybe it is worth auctioning, but possibly not.
---
HIT IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT
---
\*Disco Ball\*
---
this is flying over everyones head that don't know the mechanic for the fight. The fight when you first encounter it is a dps/ gear check. You can skip all of that if you just mind vision/first aid the debuffs off.  Hence why my first statement is "...use mechanics"
---
&gt; PD: seremos Horde ;) 
---
Gg izi, suerte con la guild
---
it makes sense thanks to the game making it totally irrelevant thanks to absurd out of combat regen. cooking is only still around because of buffs.
---
i miss it too, but it was simply unusable in legion
---
I‚Äôm getting ptsd from this. Walking into a quest area and getting swarmed by mobs like walking into a blender on smoothie mode
---
oomkin won't be able to do any of this, but keep hoping I guess...
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler is Best in Slot; it's better DPS than Atiesh, the naxx legendary.
---
F.E.A.R. came out in 2005, the difference is insane.
---
Play retail and never die.
---
Initially I was dying for beta access, so much so, that when I didn‚Äôt get access I decided to pop back into a private server.  
---
It only took me 13 levels to realize that the excitement I felt simply from watching the beta on twitch was best served used at launch, when I‚Äôd be playing with my friends and experiencing everything Vanilla was that made me fall in love with this game in the first place.
---
I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get access, and for those of us that didn‚Äôt, I think we‚Äôre truly going to appreciate that on 8.26 when we log in for the first time.
---
Me agrada la iniciativa yo me estar√≠a interesado en unirme a la guild y contribuir. Tema aparte, yo creo que no debiste publicar esto aqu√≠, ya que en mi opini√≥n personal la gente no le gustan las personas hispano-hablantes.
---
also ideally which datacenter the server is in.  this can impact latency quite a bit.
---
Agreed, across the board T2 is the best class fantasy they've ever made.
---
TO THE ZONE, WHERE I BELONNNG
---
Looks fake as fuck.
---
we suffer so that we may ascend
---
I spent a few days pointing out that attack speed is a way to nerf too.  No one even cares.
---
Dungeons were nerfed and substantially altered (mobs)  in 2.3 as well, as far as the data source this thread references.
---
Maybe. I wanna be in the beta. idgaf if my player is gonna get wiped, I just wanna play the good version of this game
---
Hey!
---
Warlock T3 is definetely next, however i don\`t plan to do T1 and T2, because they involve character face
---
Any particular staff to use with T3?
---
Druid healing is 95% healing touch rank 3 and 4. The rest is divided up into occasional HoTs and max rank healing touch.
---
I don't think healing in classic is boring regardless of class. It only gets boring if you treat it as an exercise in whack-a-mole rather than paying attention to the raid and preparing ahead of time for incoming damage.
---
Also, Priests can be a lot of fun. They have the biggest range of tools and are the most flexible healer.
---
there is no citation.  there was no broad dungeon nerf in 1.12.   elite mob dps (meaning damage/speed) may be low, but blizz is standing by it.
---
They can farm DME better than mages believe it or not.
---
I don't have ice barrier, and if i use arcane barrier i don;t have enough mana.
---
play until level 9 and the game gets you to run for 6 years to the main capital and then take a shit then.
---
Know whats crazy is I just logged on my level 1 rogue twink from early wotlk, have some rough arrows, crude throwing axe, and a keen machete which doesn't drop anymore. Apparently it stopped dropping around 2014 and from logs i'm looking at is now worth 70k? interesting find.
---
Im just making smaller pulls.
---
Not t3 but bloodfang Armor pls I beg
---
I can tell its authentic because of how many times UI was changed. :P
---
If you were a mage why did you need the full raid frames?
---
TBC sucks. Introduced flying mount, dailies, resilient. Killed vanilla content, cities and progression. Destroyed WPvP.
---
I guess I'd understand if you'd never played before, but... I wouldn't ca explore stats the peak of fun. They sound more like an extremely sub optimal mix-maxing strategy, but I guess whatever floats your zeppelin
---
... stam isn't only thing that matters, what level are you trying this at, what's the area look like? Is it all melee? Ideally you are barely getting hit so why are you getting hit?
---
Gotta answers those first, and if it's open world - it's good to practice it but keep in mind, unless you get a completely dead server aoe farming won't be possible for a long time.
---
Tauren was the only race I didn‚Äôt wanna roll until i tried it out for shits in giggles. Now it‚Äôs the only race I‚Äôll roll
---
Hit 60nhere on my feral druid. Was prob Feb 2005 as well.
---
I hate how they patched it to remove the ghost.
---
Ah there is your answer, trying to aoe without barrier is like trying to fly a kite with holes in it, you might be able to do it but it's not reliable.
---
Link 1 example of a 20 warrior speedrunners raid.
---
I get all of that... But why ooga? Google did not help, is it a meme im not aware of?
---
Play BFA if you don't have patience.
---
You‚Äôre a mage! Why do you have raid frames out! Lol
---
He wants to hit 60 and kill level 30 and below people while never being killed himself what dont you understand about that. All he wants is to talk shit about how good he is while camping lowbie zones in gear fans give to him. Gah stop stealing his fun.
---
Yeah, that is worth it probably. I don't have the money in my current route, but it might be worth trying to figure out how to fit it in.... possibly delay cooking and fishing and take that instead.
---
raid buffing is not bothersome if you have the pallypower addon.  rotation for both aoe and singletarget is the same.  judgement of command, auto, consecrate, auto, auto, judgement, repeat.  use JoC over judgement of the crusader,  unless the mob takes a while to kill.  use judgement of command on stunned targets for double dmg.  your priority is to keep vengeance up, which means crit is a big priority for rets.  you will get denied to 4/5 groups, and people will tell you your spec is terrible.  ret requires mental fortitude and patience.  you will get passed up for gear, so just accept it and be a team player.  rets are low dps, so you have to offset this with helping guildies, being reliable, and going above and beyond a regular raider.  you use both caster and melee consumables, so be prepared to be farming the majority of the time outside of raids.  casuals or players who don't want to farm potions every week should not consider rolling a ret, otherwise you will be quite disappointed.  i love the spec and am prepared to push it harder than other players.  good luck
---
Those aren't the only mobs - if you can't handle 2 and there arent any solo mobs - it's your fault for not inviting someone to help OR do another quest while you wait for someone or level up or gear up.
---
If they start running at another mob you should think of what you could do differently... save energy to burst down before they reach the low % that makes them start walking.
---
If that's too difficult, roll a Hunter.
---
Let's have a look at all the professions:
---
Skinning/Mining/Herbalism? Out of the race, since they provide no personal dps benefit.
---
Alchemy? Everyone can chug their potions so they get no *personal* dps advantage over someone who bought theirt drinks from an alchimist. On the other hand, an engineer can not hand out his best grenade /trinkets to non-engineers.
---
Enchanting? Same deal. You can get your wizard oil/enchants from an enchanter to get the same benefit as they do.
---
So it is basically down to Blacksmithing, Leatherworking and Tailoring. 
---
We could go into detail by comparing stuff like the bloodvine set bonus or BoP equip. But since you can have 2 professions anyway it is a moot point, since you could just take engi + whatever proff of the 3 you need.
---
TL;dr: engi wins because of the lack of competition. Yes it is neglectable, but it IS a dps increase nontheless. 
---
This was changed in WotlK where things like Mixology or Anatomy were added, so that every profession had boni only the owner of said profession would benefit from. But in classic Engineering is largely the only profession having them.
---
Please fuck no. As a warrior tank my repair bills are plenty and swapping specs can get retard expensive.
---
Oh so the whole point of the game is dps my mistake i guess your totally right
---
Speaking as someone who worked his way from being completely new on an established server to main tanking for a world top tier guild, don't set your goal to be MT. Just be a good reliable tank and see where things go from there. The only way you get to be MT for a competent guild is if they lose their current MT, which is not something you want for the guild you're currently in. If you try to push or weasel your way into becoming MT for a guild that's happy with their tank you're more likely to end up getting the boot.
---
I forgot about repair bills as another gold sin, added. Thanks !
---
Get a job in e-commerce.
---
To get the same spell power he has in this video in phase one, he would have 2700 hp/mp instead of 4400 and go from mid 20s crit to around 10.  
---
Like its a fine video, moonkins like all other casters can hurt you if they get to chain cast unmolested, just why mention phase one in the title.
---
What is the context for this?
---
Alliance then, alliance now. Never been fond of rolling quazimoto and living in mud huts. 
---
Dont like it, fight me. Oh wait, I'm a pver.
---
I do fedex 1-10
---
At 10, I trained all the skills I wanted to train, had a fair bit of gear (deleted a cloak and belt cause I'm dumb) and then bought three 6 slot bags. [Me at 10 on last stress test](https://i.imgur.com/wfQaEe0.jpg)
---
Gold's fine.
---
Chuck Norris pursued Lu Bu.
---
Thanks for your response. I think I'll roll with a rogue main, maybe roll a feral alt later on.
---
Even with that though, thousands of hours of gameplay will generate gold... nothing they can do about it, if they want to keep classic vanilla like.
---
Game isn't supposed to be challenging when it comes to gold after a stable market on an established server.
---
That's why twink gear will remain expensive throughout classic, unless there is a crazy item dupe or bug.
---
&gt;that most guilds will be able to clear raids with an optimal group of 30, leaving space for 10 bullshit specs.
---
Bruh, you can do MC with like 15 people, as long as someone isn't taking up a debuff slot and being dumb it should be fine. I mean hell, people 3 manned Onyxia IN Classic, when it was retail.
---
Whoop! Ally or horde?
---
Retail is so bad it honestly didn‚Äôt even cross my mind. Man, why so hostile though?
---
damn I am late. Guess all I can do now, is upvote you.
---
Fun fact: Only tauren get a sound effect when they /moo.
---
Definitlly blizzard's favorite race!
---
And one more tip for OP: Tauren Racials allows you to pick earth root from the get go ( you need 7(ish ?) for a druid Quest). So it might be worth it to grab herbalism, collect the earth roots and then dump it for whatever you want.
---
Freaking Alterac Valley man.  i remember being in school, hopping into a BG at around 6 or 7 pm at night after dinner....and when it finally finished, it was 3 AM.  That's a memory that sticks with me, how long those battles lasted.  It felt so EPIC.
---
Lol. Im glad blizz responded basically saying they don't give a fuck if he gets greifed all night and day.
---
Ally was originally a NE hunter, probably gonna to recreate em
---
Just another uneducated shitposter. Ignore him. üôÇ
---
That kind of makes me want to play Warlock a lot, but I want to roll Alliance this time, and Warlock is just a Horde class in my head.
---
I just really can't attach the human or gnome aesthetic to the class.
---
Thanks, Jack. Magical indeed!
---
Sodapoppin thinks because he has 40k viewers that he should be immune to getting camped. Calling for people to be blacklisted. The guys a total bitch and im glad its just the beta getting him so salty already.
---
same
---
Started out as Horde and never really deviated from the faction since I started playing 6 months before TBC. 13 years I have been Horde only. 
---
My group of friends are all playing alliance...so I am being forced to switch. Will still have a Horde alt though.
---
No Dps meter !!!!!
---
I've main tanked for a multitude of guilds at all ranks and I've never ever been the raid leader. If the MT is the raid leader of a guild it's most likely because of a situation exactly like the OP is talking about, where they made the guild so they could MT. 
---
Why would you want to deal with both MTing and raid leading unless you're an absolute control freak who needs to do everything yourself ?
---
Quel‚Äôserrar on my warrior!
---
One shotting a mage on 25% hp. woaw.
---
Remove Curse, there was only 1 druid in their raid from what I can see.
---
Maybe you are making the mistakes of looking at them BEFORE you had your first...few  [shimmer stouts](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Rejold%27s_New_Brew)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZcLo5uXK-I
---
A lot of people do seem to hold up TBC as the high point of the game, but I think it was the start of the decline, too. 
---
In addition to the flying mounts making the world seem empty, there's the incredible power creep that began with Outland greens; Shattrath being a sanctuary where Horde and Alliance are forced to be blue to each other; Season 2's "Welfare epics", which led to the rise of the phrase "Honor per hour" as people AFK'd AV; the death of Engineering in PvP as nothing worked against Level 61+... the list goes on.
---
That's not to say it didn't have its good parts, but then the same could probably be said for every expansion.
---
If Blizzard chooses to transition Classic to TBC as some people are asking, I hope they allow some servers to stay as the original game.
---
I mean yeah, that's the takeaway.
---
Got beta? Cool, I can test stuff to see what works.
---
No beta? Cool, I will just be that much more fresh for launch.
---
I mean vanilla should be like white, or sometimes tan/brown. That purple color is pretty deceiving.
---
Nope. Sodapoppin was talking about streamsniping not corpse camping. He even explicitly states he's ok with camping. His problem is with people who know exactly where he is sitting in stealth or following his ghost when he's trying to res. Like obvious streamsniping behaviour.
---
Why not fuck with it? For me that was the biggest draws to classic WoW was figuring out what worked best for you.  If you're not top DPS? Figure out why not? Enjoy either way bro!
---
Lmao! I had killed a 6 pack of a very strong IPA. Good catch.
---
My guild's first kill of Rag back in the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR83t7Plli4
---
Molten Core and Onyxia were such crazy times. The mechanics were so unknown and everyone had such janky gear/specs. Not to mention the scale of the raid was just something never seen before in gaming.
---
Too much running IMO. the zone was designed with planes running in mind ( basically : taurens originally were not meant to have mounts, but to run around kind of like worgen).
---
So the distances are a bit greater. but the style of the zone is on point

Because you came into the subreddit and didn't read the rules.

Boy, thank God you have buff frames fully type out the name of the buff next to the icon. How else would one know what the buff was? Love it
---
Cool, now take a straight picture so we can actually admire it
---
This is only a little face punchy inducing.  /s

You have no gold

Maybe on Loatheb.

he got no legg

I was actually watching a stream of Joanna's (guy who has worked record time for level 60) and he said a mage will probably got 60 first in classic
---
??? Don't stream then? Sorry people are jerks but that doesn't give him the right to militarize his viewer base for his cause. That scum
---
Looks like Ash Covered Boots. Looked at the screenshot and thought it was my rogue from vanilla. Haha
---
Right on! Same here. Any of these guilds ring a bell? Respice Finem, Damage Corp, Shield of Light, or Knights of Alterac. Also rerolling ally rogue, I believe.
---
My advice, don't try to min/max via guides. Just play naturally and read the talents and skills as you level. It is so much better that way! And honestly, no classic in vanilla is complicated. You'll pick it up just fine!
---
Hey if people are able to use his stream to get an advantage on him then he can use his stream to get an advantage on them. Sounds fair to me.
---
This is awesome dude!
---
As I understand it, Sodapoppin does not enjoy being camped by PvPers who can track him by watching his stream. He is calling on people, especially in his guild, to blacklist or ignore players who take advantage of his stream in this way. He wants his guild to not group with these types of people who he believes are toxic. By doing this, he hopes that this type of activity will not be rewarded and ultimately will be discouraged through consequences. Players with bad names was a common occurrence in vanilla, so it's akin to that; however, some people don't think his reasoning is justified.
---
Blizzard claims they will not have any part of this ban especially because streaming is not compulsory. Because Sodapoppin decides to stream while playing, he has made the choice to allow people to know his location.
---
Of course holy damage is not affected by armor.
---
I am not only ready for Crossroads raids.
---
I am also ready for Barren's chat.  Bring on the chuck norris jokes.
---
You're reaching pretty far there
---
I really wanted to go back and play Warrior as I always have, but they are so over saturated. I think it's probably because so many big streamers play them. Really hope things settle after.
---
I've wanted my real name since vanilla. I'm hitting every god damn server asap to get it. I shall not be denied again!
---
We are of the same mind in the above regards, but I also wish they could release the game sooner than the current schedule... because classes start back the same week as release.
---
Titan panels. Blocked off like 1/3  of the screen but in 2006 that shit was fresh as fuck.
---
God I wish there weren‚Äôt so many warriors. I want to play one, but I‚Äôm turned off because it seems like everyone and their mom will be a warrior.
---
Just dont stream looool 4HEad
---
Nice!
---
I love the art style, im sure you'll do more in the future,
---
I'd like to request T3 Rogue on a human (:
---
Cheers!
---
I have everything I need for the next 2 levels. Why would I need more than the 1 silver I have now?
---
When I won Arlokk's grasp in a PUG, and won Thekal's in my guild, and the officers had a long meeting about giving it to me.  Me: "I'm the only hunter online, ya'll tryna do Hakaar or naw?"
---
Me too brother. I wish Thunder Bluff was more populated
---
my only point was that it is a fact and not an opinion that engineering is a dps increase over other professions. 
---
I also believe that that- and only that- was the statement that /u/TB12GOAT78 wanted to get across originally.
---
What you want out of the game or what you deem important is entirely up to you. But there are people out there that enjoy MinMaxing and they will more likely than not choose engineering - especially when they also pvp a lot. Yes they are a minority. But a minority that attracts a lot of viewers even today. If I am informed correctly method streamed modern pve content quite succesfully.
---
what advantage?
---
I'll miss having a social life, that was pretty cool.
---
You wanna know what happened to the last guy who posted this?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/PXCib.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PXCib.jpg)
---
This isn't really related, but doing some research to respond, I found out that the largest illegal gold trader in World of Warcraft history (and is still in business today) is responsible for and owns Allakhazam, Thottbot, and now Wowhead.
---
So every time you use Wowhead, you give its parent company more capital to corrupt the in-game economy.
---
Might be the easiest class to gear up really quickly - really common for a single druid to get funneled many pieces of tier gear because they're the only druid in the raid.
---
You cannot aoe farm.
---
Dont play on a pvp server then? Use stream delay? Dont be a little bitch?
---
I played alliance on Kargath, the names in that screen shot bring back painful memories of being stomped by the paradosi pre mades in BGs 
---
Fun times though!
---
Rogues are pretty difficult to gank. They just vanish and gtfo. That saves a lot of corpse runs.
---
Already moused over wotf before the priest got in fear range. That was next level back in the day.
---
There is a weekly posts for guild recruiting....modz need to delete this.
---
And 9 months later, Arthas was born.
---
Use delay then? Fuckin carebears.  Imagine an ultima type server. The tears. Holy shit.
---
Would druid work for that as well?
---
But you can and that is not even true. I was running in greens with+dmg and blues except chest from mc, ab staff and zg trinket in this video. You can get ony back, raggy neck, mc staff with like 20 more intthan ab staff, ring of spell power, mana igniting cord (25 int). Literally be twice as geared as Skinwalker in this video. What you're saying is simply not true. 
---
Inb4 no guilds raids with moonkins - yes, there were a shitload of pve moonkins early on (especially on alliance) that was decked out way before BWl landed on LB and NB. Wow is easy and only really tryhard guilds care about comp.
---
Or just use the advantages of streaming? Don't be a little bitch?
---
Uhh ok?
---
NE Chad vs hunchbacked cow man. 
---
Unfortunately if you want to play horde then Tauren it is. Warstomp is a great PvP racial though.
---
\&gt;just group or play hunter lul
---
great advice. another person that wants me to quit
---
The lock experience is much better on alliance because of the threat issues on horde though. Just do it ironically as a female gnome with pink hair and you'll be fine.
---
haha, you would have to be one step ahead, especially when you clicked some of your key abilities...
---
I forced myself to keybind everything right before my 2nd pvp video in TBC.
---
I could not care less if you play or not, if you are going to shout and pout without understanding how to play and the unwillingness to learn classic... then yes, quit :)
---
That is indeed very interesting! And a bit sad
---
Good call! I looked them up and you're right. I was always bummed at how bulky they looked compared to the NS boots.
---
&gt;  Unsub from this subreddit because a lot of people here are all about min/maxing and getting to 60 as fast as possible
---
+1 to this. It's disheartening to hear so many commenters telling people what they can/cannot do, as if doing raid content within 3 weeks of launch is the end goal for every WoW player.
---
how am i not willing to learn? everyone is so fucking hostile on this subreddit
---
When I last did it (early TBC, the undead near Uther's tomb I think) I was wearing a bunch of green "... of the Eagle" gear and it was fine.
---
You need Frost Shield, and you don't want the Frostbite talent that has a chance to freeze chilled targets in place (you want them all to wander toward you slowly, rather than be randomly split off). Cone of Cold and Frost Nova and Blink to keep them off you, and just Blizzard away.
---
Sounds like you're getting hit too much. From what I remember 90% of aoe farming is actually grouping the pull into a managable clump. Kite in a large circle to clump them up and rank 1 frostbolt squirters. Only once you have them well grouped do you start using blizzard.
---
Fair enough. Was he actually calling for Blizzard to get involved tho?
---
Firelands was a touch on the short side for its duration. Only thing it really did wrong was not having a bit more content.
---
Thanks for sharing =D
---
First Aid, FD, and Multishot around CC, and early aggro on multiple mob pulls.
---
Yes and no. Druids don't have lockpicking, so some of the stealth run chests won't be available to them (at least not without blacksmithing/engineering and those mats are expensive) and they'll need to get the key in order to run around the full instance. 
---
Their stealth also isn't as powerful as a rogue's and they don't have vanish, so if they get caught, that's GG. Plus, on the typical BRD Dark Iron Ore run, there are a few packs you need to solo and I'm not sure Druid could do it. Rogues have so much available CC.
---
A Rogue + Druid make a great stealth run team though. There's a ton of bosses they can chew through without having to clear any trash. A druid friend and I did this in ZG a bunch to farm for rep.
---
Was he even old enough to do it? 2012 was seven years ago. I'm guessing he was still in college or fresh out. Seems alot of stuff is pinned on his dad that you may be pinning on him.
---
I should have been a main tank in Vanilla.  My 5 man tanking skills where off the charts in terms of efficiency and speed, healers loved me to tank for them as I always gave them breathing room via consumables at just the right moment, I masted tanking many mobs at once, tank kiting hard hitting mobs, I knew every fight, had great awareness so my healers never ate it, and positioning, etc.  I was fucking good.  
---
And I was never more then #3 tank in my guild.  I was a far better tank than the MT and was pretty close as good as the OT who frankly was one of the best tanks I've ever seen.  The reason I was never had a shot at the role was because the MT and OT where always there for every last raid.  As others have said, being a MT or even the OT, is a guild position.  I wasn't part of the guild early enough to be the MT or the OT so the role was never offered to me.   Instead I contented myself with being a awesome DPS warrior and keyed up a good quarter of the guild for Ony via tanking 5 mans.  Eventually I transitioned to hunter because our Hunter core was fucking awful.
---
If you want to be a MT, get in a guild at day 1 to MT or build your own guild.
---
Inflation will always keep increasing. Just a matter of how slow or fast. It'll may stall out at times or maybe even fall depending on the item, but it'll increase again eventually. Think of how gold is generated. Quests, humanoids, and vendors. That means that as long as players are generating more than players are sinking gold there will be inflation. Unless your server is dead there will always be people generating gold. However most people aren't going to be sinking gold every day (except a minimal amount for the AH).
---
I went mining, I could aquire the mats for a Enchanted Thorium Bars, sell them for 20-30g every single day. Helped off-set the costs of repairs/respeccing.
---
Learn to kite early, the Hunter's bow quest is one of the best in the game imo. One of my favorite moments of WoW was I was running crowd control for a guildie hunter in Un'Goro, and he had the quest mob at like 5%, and a horde hunter tried to grief. we essentially 3 shot him with a mage but my multishot was actually the killing blow on his quest mob.  He still got to loot thankfully.
---
Tauren Hunter here. Can‚Äôt wait to tame Mazzranache again! I miss you little, pink buddy!
---
You just reminded me that there was a time when alt-tabbing was impossible to do playing fullscreen games.
---
Oh the times how they have changed...
---
So waiiiit a second. This entire shitfest on this sub... is because a streamer who doesn‚Äôt like being stream sniped talked about his community not playing with those players that stream snipe him? Why the fuck do people care? You all hate the streamers so much you wanna avoid being on their server, but then they say they‚Äôre not going to play with you anyway and you burn the sub down? ......
---
You picked the wrong instance, fool!
---
Retail is much different than vanilla wow. Retail has 15 years of dev and changes. Honestly just play a private server if you wanna specifically practice classic
---
I don't reply based off what others comment... I didn't tell you to get good or kick rocks, gave you the options you have to complete the objective.
---
Probs some insider shit going on. Always is
---
They could leave it at 40 due to having an Alpha server.
---
However, I think the beta will run past the final July stress test, and there will be one more level cap raise.
---
To mage the hardest a mage has ever maged.
---
me and the boys throwback
---
I grinded my priest from 59 to 60 there without getting all the horns. It was crazy, but I still remember it as a fun time :P
---
His point is that when you faced an equally skill opponent you're going to lose more often due to the racial disadvantage. 
---
Obviously if things aren't equal you can win. Just fight scrubs or camp Redridge will also give you a win.
---
Yup. The entitlement of some of these guys is hilarious. Like laughably bad
---
Don't be. Being new and experiencing everything for the first time is something a lot of us would kill to have again. 
---
Modern WoW is nothing like Classic. Classic has more RPG (roleplaying game) elements while Modern has more dungeon crawler/raiding elements. They're 2 entirely different games. 
---
Everyone on this sub will tell you to not play BFA and to stick with classic, but honestly, that's a decision that should be left up to you. 
---
If you purchase a WoW sub, you'd be able to play up to the previous expansion's content (Legion, lvl cap 110)- you'd have to purchase BFA to play BFA content. Having a WoW sub also lets you play Classic.
---
you told me to give up. what the fuck are you talking about?
---
&gt;Recruiting Warlocks was a bitch.
---
Just something about the class that sucks.  I like them until about 30 and then I lose all interest.
---
I sure see a lot of threads trying to prop up boomkins and ret pallies, or other stuff that we know already is not good in vanilla WOW raiding.  I don't get it, the knowledge is out there.  Cool, if you get all the perfect gear and you are a great player and you min/max all your consumables and world buffs...you can ALMOST keep up with the pure classes lol.  Why not just put in all that effort to one of the classes that we know is already going to be good and be a solid contributor to your raid?  Putting all this effort in just to put up average numbers, I don't get it.
---
That is classic dude, there are many classes that can't realistically pull more than one mob, so it isn't just rogue.
---
No, he was talking exclusively about server communities policing themselves, he never was asking for Blizzard intervention
---
For raiding sure, for pvp its kind of worse so its a trade-off. I'll probably still make a Warlock, but in my head they're so attached to Undead and Orcs.
---
"Those aren't the only mobs - if you can't handle 2 and there arent any solo mobs - it's your fault for not inviting someone to help OR do another quest while you wait for someone or level up or gear up.
---
If that's too difficult, roll a Hunter."
---
Sure looks like I said give up... goodbye child.
---
Same thing happened to my card and I had no idea what was going on as a 15 year old boy.  My guild was in the process of clearing server first C'thun and my card finally gave out.  Took me 2 months to save up enough for a new rig and my super hardcore guild had to replace me.  It was devastating to teenage me to say the least...
---
Feels good to be in Australia man
---
Classic has far fewer motorcycles
---
I soloed him.  Took about 15 tries,kiting, a shitload of consumables, etc.  If I ever level a rogue again, I'm going to get get another rogue to help me.
---
1) can be circumvented by good planning. If your guild has one designated tailor who is more interested in is trade skill than power leveling at all costs, then you simply send him the materials and he crafts stuff for everyone. You didnt wase time skilling the profession, he did not need to farm for it. Win-Win.
---
Definitly worth it for single target. Especially around mid 40s. Between [dreamweave], [azure], monestary [dagger+offhand]/[zul farrak staff] and [gnomeregan boots]/[tanaris pirate Q boots] you definitly hit a critical mass of spell power.
---
I thought this whole guide was... 
---
&gt;[**Tailored** around the Mage class]
---
 after all :-P
---
those well named corpses are just great
---
Play Stardew Valley instead. It‚Äôs closer to vanilla than BfA.
---
Well, don‚Äòt blame the goldsellers, blame the ppl who buy the gold. üòÖ
---
Really that's basically all I would do too. Play a few classes to 10-14, just to get a feel again to decide my class. I honestly don't want to actually play beta, running dungeons and such. I want to save that for launch on a character that won't be erased. I'm not even going to look at speedrunning guides. The last thing I want to do is blast rapidly through the levels on a set of rails.
---
If I support blizzard I may as well support them, too.
---
The beta started May 15th and the level cap was increased on June 4th. That's exactly 20 days.
---
So maybe level 50 on June 24th 
---
and level 60 on July 14th 
---
and Molten Core on August 3rd.
---
I really hope not.
---
Completely different. Vanilla very slowly gives you new abilities and with the levelling taking longer by the time you are 60 if you are a half decent gamer you will know your class quite well.
---
Keep watching videos and reading guides and learn more, but take it easy. Vanilla content is a lot about the levelling and doing as much as you can on the way up. I personally think there will be many more like you.
---
The most important thing is finding a good group of people to play with. Talk in chat. Make friends, ask for help if you see someone of your class playing well. There was multiple times I may have quit WoW even during vanilla and tbc (it‚Äôs not a game without flaws) but it‚Äôs the people that kept me logging in, and now I have a wife to show for it. ;)
---
Wtf they gave him legs??
---
Affinity Media was said to be one of the parent companies of IGE, though the company no longer has any ownership stake. Affinity Media's senior vice president of business development John Maffei, noted that "we‚Äôre no longer in that business." [14] Affinity retains control of Allakhazam.com, Thottbot.com, and has since purchased Wowhead.com.[15]
---
Just read the thing you linked, a parent company that isnt affiliated with IGE owns wowhead
---
Honestly there‚Äôs no better time to start playing. Yes everyone who played have a better idea. You get to experience as it was when it came out. Only in today‚Äôs time will people feel pressure about a game. My best advice is just play the game and enjoy it don‚Äôt worry about what the rest are doing. Play at your own pace and you will learn and make friends and have a better time then the ones who just want to mindlessly grind and plan everything out.
---
read what you said again. how do you not get the impression that you're telling me that i should give up?
---
well make a site as good as or better than wowhead
---
Well said! Been strongly considering rolling a druid for classic and I think you just convinced me.
---
&gt;How does the free trial experience compare to vanilla wow (at least up to lvl 20)?
---
Vanilla = delicious PB&amp;J.
---
Retail = plain white bread.
---
Just jump in and play. Vanilla mechanics are really simple compared to retail. If you can grasp retail classic will not trouble you. The real difference comes from time investment needed to progress. Classic will be a lot slower paced than your retail trial. Leveling, gearing, combat will all be slower. That's actually a good thing because you'll have plenty of time to learn the ropes.
---
https://classicdb.ch/
---
Elaborate joke?
---
It does
---
IGE employs people at slave wages in order to turn a profit on goldselling.
---
Yes, the people that purchase the gold are complicit, but I think you'd have a difficult time arguing that the drug user in Miami is equally responsible for the awful living conditions of a poor coca farmer under the totalitarian thumb of a Colombian drug lord.
---
I hope they don't open up raids. Maybe just have in-house testing. I think it'll be nice for everyone to go in blind. If there are bugs they can always patch it on the fly.
---
I was OG bonechewer &lt;Escaper&gt; horde side before re rolling on frostmourne when oceanic tag realms dropped.
---
Well if noone would buy it, there is no market for it. But idk what the farmer would do otherwise to earn a living
---
I was a night elf hunter for the most part, Kellindil, but I remember a few names of those I pvp'd against in to the wee hours of the morning
---
Am I the only one wondering about the voidwalker
---
Streamers bullied me in high school, stole my crush and now they are playing MY GAME
---
Check out his stream, it's as wholesome and entertaining as his videos.
---
Get rid of all of the streamers.  WoW classic demands nu-metal pvp videos and nothing else.
---
Perhaps I have missed all the details, but the video I watched of Soda talking about this seemed pretty overt about the "ban" (he called it a blacklist most of the time) being a blacklist that the playerbase would use and Soda would encourage, cross-faction in fact. The link to the video was posted in one of the previous topics about this subject.
---
Cool! I definitely remember that guild name. We probably ganked each other once or twice!
---
Another thing is everyone on here is talking about end game rushing and this and that, stuff they will do in the first two months.  People are so forward looking because they can't play and hype up about stuff.  Vanilla overall should last more or less 2 years, plenty and plenty of time to learn game mechanics.
---
Someone with a clean ui! I salute you!
---
I‚Äôd hope you would. We were part of the server 1%.
---
I'm in the beta and I stopped playing around level 12 for specifically the reason you mentioned - I didn't want to burn out or ruin the content. It's been almost 15 years since I've done vanilla, I wanna go in fresh.
---
so annoying 
---
who would watch this
---
I remember a lot of good name combos over the years, the most memorable was a Challenger Shuttle &lt;Explosion&gt;
---
Reason to go male undead, are you a male irl? Dont be a fuckin weird boy and be the gender you arent...
---
If they go forward with progressive itemization this far it‚Äòs not in. Personal opinion: it will be in from the start
---
&gt;I question my class choice *all the time* lol.
---
I fixed it for you.
---
It's like a wheel of fortune with all the class names on it. It wont stop spinning until the char gets created.
---
little salty bois crying in the comments cause a clip was posted lmao.
---
Take heart.
---
First of all, that's under 20% warriors (19.2%). Every single dungeon group, especially ones without paladin, can support a warrior. Who else is going to roll need on all the mail gear pre 40, and plate gear after 40?
---
Secondly, who the hell else are warriors going to kill in world pvp? I am by NO means a pvp expert. In fact, I am probably the least qualified to answer this, but what I have gathered from reading this forum is that prior to raid gear, warriors are the underdog in every single world pvp matchup.....
---
But you can't be an underdog in a mirror match, can you? 
---
If anything, this should encourage you. world pvp would be worse if everyone else picked other classes, and this is frankly, about the right number of warriors for dungeon groups. 
---
Give it a go.
---
That's not even the most interesting thing.  The most interesting thing is that Steve Bannon was CEO for a stint.

I started playing retail and have been treating it as a completely different game. If you play retail wow and compare it to our beloved classic wow, tbc or even wrath than you will be disappointed. Since I‚Äôve started playing retail with this mindset I‚Äôve actually been able to chill and enjoy it, knowing it‚Äôs not the same game. It‚Äôs a bit overwhelming because there‚Äôs soooo much in the game but at the same time it‚Äôs a good time sink. The storytelling is really good in quests so far and there‚Äôs a lot of cinematic which is cool. I‚Äôm playing a demon hunter so the lore behind them is pretty interesting. Just keep this mind set and you might have a chance at enjoying retail for what it is.
---
Pretty sure the following "The Importance of Retaining the Integral Composition of Replicating the Core Essetinal Fundamentals of Classic wow." doesn't make sense. 
---
If you had said "The importance of retaining the integral composition of Classic WoW" that would have made sense but the rest of it seems to be pretty nonsensical.
---
No ones really going in blind. The mechanics the same as they‚Äôve ever been
---
Hi, /u/Schwifty_5

&gt;You cannot aoe farm.
---
[Abso-fucking-lutely wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sI38mG46k)
---
I was a Troll tank on Nos, through a big chunk of vanilla content. 
---
I see now a lot of people recommending troll tanks as the meta over the last 6 months, but I feel like people have really overestimated (or been misled as to) how good Berserking is and how easy it is to use reliably while tanking. Trying to time it after big spikes of damage between heals is tricky, especially when you're also trying to position mobs and build threat at the same time. The delay on spell batching that classic will have implemented should make it even harder. The idea that you'll be able to get close to the 30% boost with every pop is extremely ambitious. 
---
And let's say you do reliably pop it perfectly, on 3minute CD, that 30% boost evens out to a paltry 1.6% boost over the course of a 3 minute fight. And that's a boost to your white damage, not your threat per second, which will be even lower. you would probably be better off focusing your attention on building threat and cleanly weaving HSes into your rotation.
---
Anyway, as to your main thought, find a guild early on, tank 5mans for people, show you know what you're doing and go out of your way to help people. Be on a lot, turn up and most important, be reliable. You cannot be unreliable as a main tank. Stuff like race choices and professions is a minor consideration compared to being able to show up week after week until it's done, and not flake out. People who can do that make up a miniscule portion of the people who are going to be rolling warrior, and they're the ones who will be picked as MTs. They're going to be funneling gear to you, if you don't think you can make basically every raid day for the next 6 months, maybe reconsider it or be okay with being a backup/off tank, which every raid needs anyway but won't be geared until the main tank is done.

of course

That was cringey to read but I get it, haha. Only 'elitex guild on Bonechewer I paid attention to was VM. They had fun drama and some cool players.

I‚Äôm playing on PS at the moment and everyone is clamouring for Tanks for leveling dungeons.

I'm going to make a gnome mage and just go *totally nuts* having fun with questing - I've barely *scratched* the surface of questing in vanilla areas of the not cataclysm'd WoW, this is going to be like starting a new expansion for me.
---
When I'm tired doing that, maybe I'll make a hunter again. I always liked playing one when soloing, and I never got to see what the class quests were like.
---
Maybe I'll even make a priest again. That item I got from ragnaros just before cataclysm hit on my then main still vexes me. I'd really like to be able to do that stratholme quest some day, so I could at least *see* that priest staff that can transform.
---
My first day though, there is one thing I must do before anything else.
---
First thing on my bucket list is to sacrifice myself to Hogger.
---
Just once. I've never died to him before. I need to change that.
---
Either its supposed to be troglodyte speech seeing how they took the savage and feral trolls or maybe  [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ooga](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ooga).
---
Just googled this myself. "Surprise" is in the definition so it would fit.
---
It is literally not possible.  The MC replacement trinket wasn't added into the game until the pvp patch, it is a phase 2 item.

I‚Äôm between Priest &amp; Paly. I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll /who on Human and Dwarf staring zones. If one class is significantly less than the other then that‚Äôs the class I‚Äôll roll. Otherwise I‚Äôll be rolling Paly. Probably...
---
With grape or strawberry jelly?
---
I /who ‚Äòd in Silverpine last night (PS) and there was one Druid on the full list.
---
People were dueling outside of Ironforge and there would be an announcement "Astingray has defeated Steveirwin in a duel."
---
Never tried grape! Strawberry or Raspberry :)
---
Best thing you can do for yourself is not look at other people playing or even the Reddit, and actually experience the world with your own eyes for the first time.
---
So what if it takes you a lot longer to hit 60 than a bumrusher like me. I bet you will have many times more fun on your journey than I will on mine. I know all the content already, and look forward to the organic encounters in the game created by players. 
---
But said organic encounters is something you can't plan for. The only topic we have to discuss is the known.
---
This makes no sense. How does blacklisting players have an effect when they're on the opposing faction? The only way this would work is if Soda's demands were accepted by a good portion of the opposing faction and i don't think I've ever seen someone successfully dictate how people should play in their own faction let alone have the opposing faction agree to it.
---
I don't care one way or another what Soda wants to do, i just don't think it will work.
---
Don't. Every new mmo feels a little overwhelming and intimidating at first, but there is nothing to it. This game is very newb friendly and you'll get the hang of it quickly enough.
---
Name checks out!
---
No, you just need reagents from a poison supplies vendor. 
---
However, Blind requires Fadeleaf but you could just buy that off the auction house.
---
No reason for EJ to come back really - the theorycrafting and discussions are all basically housed here on reddit, or on the mmo-champion forums at this point. EJ was around prior to reddit - so a lot of the big theorycrafters stayed there til the sight died out around the end of WotlK/Cata (don't remember when exactly, since I didn't play cataclysm)
---
Nop you get your stuff from the poison vendor then craft it!
---
He's on to me!
---
crazy how much money that dude made off of it
---
I thought so but i didn't play a rogue in vanilla(played a pally) so i wasn't sure.
---
Thanks btw
---
&gt;Black listing isn't banning... sooooo
---
use this site and some of the classes they actually have webarchive links to some of the old elitist jerks stuff
---
http://www.vanilla-info.com/
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=23604&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=37054
---
I assumed with being locked at classic gear and levels that the towers might still be important. I can't remember when ignoring became a thing, though I do remember it happening several times that I played.
---
Unlikely. The forums got pretty ugly towards the end and all the big theorycrafters left for greener grass. The GM got hired by Blizzard.
---
Icy Veins will probably make a Classic section though and you can still browse the archives of EJ with Wayback Machine, it's just more difficult.
---
That's not funny, my mom died from necrophilia.
---
People don't care sad little neck beards that always find something to cry about do. Right now the game isn't launched so they can't cry tears about how "imbalanced" the game is every time they die. So instead they cry tears about "chad" streamers getting stuff.
---
Yeah, I was hoping that wasn't the case. I mean, I love reddit but there are way too many shitposts and other stuff going on to be able to have the structure EJ did. At least in this sub, I mean I could see a sub directly for theorycraft and strategy guides but it would have to be it's own sub with strict rules/moderation.
---
lol, have fun :D

Alliance 'locks have to PvP against WotF. Not great.
---
Horde 'locks have to PvE without Salvation. Not great.
---
Locks PvP poorly against melee, which is expected to be pretty strongly represented. Not great.
---
Icy Veins has more theorycrafters than any other site.
---
If I had the copy pasta on hand I‚Äôd smack that bitch down right here
---
Ion quits as lead designer and reforms EJ for classic.
---
I still have an Ankh on my shaman.
---
All of the major streamers plan on playing on the same server. The allie and horde streamers like eachother so I doubt sharing a black list across factions will be hard. This isn't new. Black listing was big in 2005 as well. You piss off the major guilds on the server and you will find yourself persona non grata. This will not be unique to streamers.
---
I think they will leave it at 40
---
Now that is a trip down memory lane
---
I have the Alliance book listing the individual honor rankings and their logo.  Apparently it sells for 3+ million gold. Cant find a buyer though, anyone interested?
---
....that'll be 10 gold.
---
Not the same - for being new this is the single most important thing to wrap your head around then everything else will fall in place... Average time played to hit 60 (back in the day when players were spread out already, but didn't have the knowledge they do today) was 9-13 days /played.
---
If you were to play 12 hours a day every day after launch you would hit 60 in 20 days.
---
Classic isn't hard, it's time consuming.
---
If you play a lot and last longer than 3 months, you'll have a ton of learning to do but you'll have fun.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, maybe I‚Äôm not looking in the right places, but icy veins seems to be more cookie cutter generalized spec/build advice rather than the ultra specific theorycrafting that EJ once provided.
---
We're in patch 1.12 when they added Blinding Powder to pretty much every humanoid's pickpocket loot table. As long as you're using the pickpocket macros, you probably won't ever need to buy Fadeleaf.
---
I could see them do lvl 50 and not 60
---
By not giving 60, it would still feel like there is a lot left to explore in the game. This way the beta would ‚Äúonly‚Äù show the lvling part of the game, instead of the whole game. It would keep people hungry, and the beta would be more of a demo of the game, rather than the actual game
---
The problem with 50 tho, is that they might get into some of the endgame stuff that they want to save
---
I was expecting the cap to be raised later this month, the beta having a cap of 49, and to end after the last stress test.        
---
Now I got no idea
---
Yeah, I don't want to balls to the walls out the gate. There are people who are already practicing speed runs, I just won't be able to keep up. Going to try to build some friendships, make a name for myself in the world, join a decent guild.
---
Then probably speed run my second 60 lol
---
Spot on.
---
It's only going to be turned on for phase 1 and no longer Ion said, and they also said it may be turned off early if the zone loads are stable enough. You're going to be running into the same players for months and years.
---
except its still no changes from classic if its just an older patch, no changes means no QOL changes that wernt in vanilla
---
It is. That work happens on the discords
---
Perhaps that ‚Äúbonechewer‚Äù will be back.
---
- Find solo mobs
---
- Find someone to do it with
---
- Be patient until you get better gear
---
- Try something easier until you are higher level
---
- Save energy and burst down at the end
---
- Try a class that is stronger at levelling
---
The guy literally gave you 6 suggestions and you sperg out. Wtf man
---
Imagine not using a catheter for your pee, an IV for hydration and not having a toilet installed near your desk... what preparing have you been doing... its 2019
---
I really wanted to test things out and do some pvp.
---
So the spirit of what EJ was still exists, just have to dig for it a bit to get to the good stuff
---
Yeah, welcome to Retail. IV takes the useful sim results, the rare /r/CompetitiveWoW post, and crawls the various class discords for anything useful and then re-writes it for everyone else to understand. There is no ultra-specific theorycrafting necessary in Retail WoW.
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume Terru and Tetra were hunters?
---
Slow release Adderall is more cost efficient in terms of energy, and less likely to tire you out from the excess movement that cocaine will cause you to perform because of the burst of energy it gives. Another decent option is speed or amphetamines, although those both have the downside of 1. Excess movement wastes energy (from all the jerking off you will inevitably do) 2. You shouldnt be addicted to anything but classic wow... fucking disgusting
---
So accurate. Won‚Äôt even affect the game much. Even if they do, get the fuck over it.
---
It's not your only option for DPS. If everyone had the same attitude as you do, people wouldn't know that Seal of Command is *generally* your best option for DPS.
---
It's not your preference kid. You'll use whatever weapon you can get your hands on that is strongest.
---
No he didn't.
---
Not really brah. But people grow older and their lives changes.
---
Man this conversation was over 4 hours ago. I‚Äôm sleeping.
---
Eye of Divinity and Petrified Ancient Leaf will be added in phase 2. I don't know about the Priest quest, but the Hunter one had an item that was lootable off Azergos.
---
I love the screenshot but I hate your UI.
---
Do you have a source for this? Where did he say that he was going to try to get blizzard involved?
---
This isn't retail where you have your pick of identical ranged weapons. You'll use the strongest weapon you manage to get youre hands on, and nothing else.
---
The way aoe spell leeway (or lack thereof), blizzard chill ticks and mob melee range are currently working on classic make aoe much tougher than on pservers.
---
Damn, I was trying to think who Astin Gray was for like 3 minutes.
---
Fucking moron.  He can either roll on a PvE server or stop streaming.
---
For farming? Hunter or Mage hands down.
---
For shenanigans? Night Elf Priest. Shadow Meld near a hazard and make some poor unsuspecting fool jump to his death with Mind Control. Or on boats/zepps after takeoff.
---
"I didn't get scarab lord and it was all because of those damn streamers!"
---
Those bloody Kolkarr aren't going to massacre themselves

Pretty sure this is fake because limits on names are 12 characters.
---
It's not gonna go any higher.
---
I'm just doing 1-30 runs on some p servers. Geta my route down pat, and also let's me figure out what classes I want to play. 
---
Currently I'm torn between Druid and any an actual good healer for topping the charts.
---
I agree with this, iknow it's good for me not to get in,  but I'm such a child i still want a key even though iknow it's no good for me lol
---
You do know that a lot of people have done it all before right? How is that "going in blind"?
---
I'm playing Alliance this time. The only thing I miss is the superior casting animations of the Horde.
---
Vanilla Armor had the best colors.
---
Dude I envy you, I wish I could experience wow for the first time again, specially vanilla wow. Just have fun and don‚Äôt worry about end game so much, classic is about the journey.
---
Your spell elements use a bubbled event handler while wow-class elements have the click handler directly applied to them.
---
Maybe this will help?

1.5 AV in 2019 on a 1.12 patch isn't going to play out the same way it did in 2005. If the two teams do not want the games to last long, they won't.
---
Lol
---
Planned on using my hunter for farming herbs for raid consums. Always gotta have that 60 at for farming stuff
---
Yea but that was so long ago. The last time 40 man content was current was like 12 years ago. It'll be blind or close to it for a large number of people.
---
Pulling one mob out of a group (works best if the target doesn't have ranged attacks):
---
Throw your shit at the mob.
---
The mob group is aggroed.
---
Run away.
---
Stop and throw again if he is still far away.
---
When the mobs catch up, attack only the target while running away using strafing.
---
Use evasion if necessary. (Trapped, dazed, whatever)
---
If you have problems with dealing damage: upgrade your main hand.

I know it's nothing new, i remember ninja looters and players being obnoxious in chat being ignored and "excommunicated" so to speak. But this is a little weirder because if one player just wants to harass soda the entire server ignores them. And how does he distinguish between ganking and stream sniping? This could mean players may not ambush streamers out in the world in case they mistake it for sniping giving streamers a deterrent and another advantage. Or it could backfire greatly and cause streamers to have a bigger target on their back and have enemies make the game almost unplayable.
---
Again i just don't see this working. It's a different type of blacklisting than it was in the past, it's asking others to blacklist a group or individual on your behalf. In the past it was more of a warning "be careful, this guy ninja loots!" type of thing.
---
It was Irvine, not Anaheim, and the meeting was on May 8th. There are no links, it wasn't a public event.
---
Doing dungeons isnt speedrunning though
---
Obviously he doesn't want to take a hit to his personal fun (He is big on PvP, thus a PvE realm would suck) and his stream quality (chat delay, as he reads it and interacts with chat) so he is using another method that most other streamers seem to agree with. 
---
If all streamers play on a server and set up a blacklist for stream sniping, who the fuck cares? Unless they start to abuse this blacklist by adding people to it for minor offences or personal grudges, it is just another tool to stop people from harassing them. Streamsnipers are pathetic, so unless you plan on being one, I dont see why you or anyone else gives a fuck.
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying Sonii, good gameplay, loves world pvp interactions and doesn‚Äôt gripe when he gets counter camped. He‚Äôs active, but doesn‚Äôt beg for shit.

ah ok i changed it thank you
---
So I was planning on rolling ele shaman with the 30/0/21 hybrid spec once I'm level 60. Should I roll enhancement while I'm still leveling though? I've heard ele is very mana dependent and think it might be better to go some sort of enhance build before I hit 60.
---
Hope they leave it at 40
---
leave the real stuff for when the game releases
---

Some valid points
---
To be honest, i leveled a tauren warrior in vanilla, brought him to rank 14 and tier 2.5 and absolutely hated the animations and giant hit box / goofy animations the entire time.
---
That being said, warstomp and bonus HP were dope.
---
Were you an undead mage? or troll hunter? Heph or Urd?
---
Whos crying here though? Your favourite streamer or reddit?
---
Thought so

---
K?
---
I still don't know what you're after. There was no press about the event and attendees were told not to say anything.
---
It‚Äôs pretty normal to feel intimidated by the ‚Äúmin-maxers‚Äù. I played vanilla wow from day 1, right through to the end content into TBC, hardcore , before quitting and then coming back to raid in WotLK, into WoD etc.. 
---
Coming back to classic and WoW now, after a 2 year break, and reading all the theory craft again and trying to remember what it was like.. I feel intimidated by all these nerds and their streaming and ‚Äúdo this do that‚Äù instructions. 
---
Fuck them dude, just login, strap in and enjoy the ride. It‚Äôll be heaps of fun I promise.
---
Vanilla? Wow!
---
You know this is the best summary of this situation.
---
&gt; If you don't wanna watch streamer interacting with their viewers then watching live streams is probably not gonna work for you.
---
I don't mind interaction, at all. It's the constant SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON AND AND MAKE SURE YOU HIT SUBSCRIBE 4 or 5 times within 60 seconds that makes me unable to handle it.
---
yeah you'd have to make any content at all for that to happen.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/madseasonshow
---
It's totally different even at 1-20, but you'll find that difficulty rewarding. Yes you might get ganked by UD rogues and orc warriors while you level because you didn't no-life ahead of the curve, but you can enjoy playing the OG vanilla dungeons with actual groups and interacting with other players which makes it far better!
---
They‚Äôre just the best class in vanilla. Only viable raid tank, essential in pvp for ms, fury is a top FPS spec.
---
Shut up, naga.

Took my guild months just to finally kill him lol. The questing hub and Hyjal quests were pretty fun too especially for hunters.

---
Right , lvling first aid is much easier/faster especially when you have the GEAR to mow down some humanoids lol
---
You mad bro?
---
I'm of the same frame of mind.  I not going to smash it out the gate either.  I'm really looking forward to just plodding along like a casual this time around.  I really hope they don't progress beyond 60.
---
Hey Xeb. Mcc here
---
He requested a streamer realm be made.
---
I'd expect them to test the raids at some point
---
I played the wow beta and have played for 15 years. I know all content and most quests in vanilla. I wish there was a way to wipe all of that so I could go in blind and experience everything new. Classic will be one of the best games release this year. It will be a wonderful experience for players like yourself. .....if you manage to not quit before 20.
---
dude what??
---

His stream features an MS paint drawing of his Youtube avatar sitting at a desk like a stream lol. He's very aware/conscious of his anonymity.

Instant Poison doesn't proc nearly as much as you think before a mob is dead. You're lucky if it procs twice.

Madseason deserves much more praise than he gets. Such an amazing content creator for Classic and he truly loves the game.
---
"and added it **back** in with 2.0 as alliance **was about to** receive shamans and horde paladins."  
---
    
---
Prepatch was 2.0 without access to Outlands or max levels raised to 70.  
---
I was agreeing with you lol xD  
---
What I was saying was that someone I know claims that tier pieces would drop for both factions early on, but he might just have been confused because t1 bracers/belts would drop for both factions throughout.

Don‚Äôt forget Lok‚Äôtar ogar

Love me some madseason!
---
Doubtful, the guild leader is busy being the lead game designer of Modern WoW.
---
Arms warrior in raid? Impossible!
---
I mean, I think you've kind of answered your own question. What made EJ possible was the tone of the discussion set by Ion (and Kaubel) together with the fact that EJ the guild had achievements at a high enough level to attract analytically-minded posters from many of the top guilds at a time when almost nobody had experience playing with great players from other servers. There are other factors as well that I don't think you could recreate. The frustration with the end of AQ and the tight tuning of Naxx forced players to confront the issue of understanding the technical details of how the game worked for the first time. This just isn't necessary anymore (for classic).
---
The days before keybinds existed. Atleast you figured out there was more then 1 action bar! I would open the spell book to use gouge.
---
People probably just read your history and thought you were a troll.
---
Stormlingx is pretty chill. Ebbnflow is very quiet most of the time. Both play druid.
---
I also like Venruki, very chill guy, i expected him to be loud and all because he is one of the big names but he seems like a total bro to me.
---
Check out Frostadamus too for chill gameplay and accents.
---
Pretty much everyone who played vanilla went to Hyjal at some point. Was one of my best experiences.
---
Yeah I'm 32 so that's definitely why. 5 years ekstra of painting like a child. üòÇ

Yep, decided I‚Äôm playing Paladin in Classic.

---
He said he would like them to but he doesn't think they'd care, so he is taking things into his own hands. It's funny because there is a 2 year old clip from allcraft bouncing around now where soda was saying anyone complaining about being ganked should be shamed.
---
Yes, all the class discords are where the dedicated people go.
---
I wonder if the beta players who don't care about streamers can feel their impact on the server.
---
Would make a good deck of cards.
---
[Here](https://www.wowhead.com/transmog-set=991/vicious-gladiators-plate-armor) you go, bud.

I honestly dont understand, why people want back these long AV matches. There is nothing enjoyable to join the battle, just to leave it after 2 hours of effort for nothing.
---
You mean that spriest that increases all warlocks dps by 10%
---
i just want to look up certain streamers and content creators and see how there opinions on sharding changed after that meeting. I find it really weird that even though sharding has its benefits when the game first releases, alot of streamers were either pretty sketched out by it or not liking it at all. But for some reason everyone LOVES layering. Layering in my opinion is  little better the sharding but not by much at all (layering is like sharding 1.1) . Definatley not better enough to where i havnt heard anyone complaing about layering whos a pretty big content creator. I atleast expect to see some people be skeptical about it but theres none of that either.
---
Think January is when they flew out and played alpha build
---
So are you a Soda stan or Asmon stan???
---
I was an Orc rogue; joined Escaper shortly after they downed Razorgore in BWL. Stopped playing after we downed Twin Emps in AQ 40. Started again in TBC  as a Belf Paladin and got up until Sunwell after that Patchwerk like-boss; quit before the guild downed Muru. I wonder if we crossed paths in the guild.
---
Corpse camping a streamer is stream sniping. There is no way for them to distinguish one from the other, plenty of innocent people have been banned from games like pubg because of this in the past.
---
Love it, but can you take a picture of it normally? not all tilted
---
the anti streamer meta on this sub is more annoying than anything these streamers do
---
Dude this is pretty amazing. I agree with another guy, would make a nice deck of cards.
---
The use of this meme here makes no sense to me. What self-inflicted wound are we blaming on streamers?
---
Avenged Sevenfold and Thrice
---
We would have dude. But this ain‚Äôt a throwaway and anyone who knows escaper knows who I am irl. I like internet secrets.
---
Crendor is one of the only good ones
---
Opinions didn't change about layering because of the meeting, they changed because of getting into the beta and realizing it's not so bad (minus the quirks they're fixing).
---
You still won't ever find a "here's what we learned at the May 8th meeting article or video".
---
And WSG flags not showing on map.
---
But they won't do either.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for all the against the grain people to fail miserably.
---
There‚Äôs some middle of the pack stuff like spriest and tanking Druid that can work in the proper gear and proper groups.
---
But others will fail.  Nobody wants a prot pally or boomkin.  When I was 13 years old I thought paladins were awesome and spent about 6-9 months leveling one to 60.  When it came time to raid, you didn‚Äôt get invited if you were Ret or prot.  If you were invited, you got kicked as soon as they realized.
---
Certain specs are not viable in raids.  It‚Äôs not about the player, the group or the gear.  Blizzard just failed to give certain specs the tools needed.
---
Staysafe said "fooled you for the last 2 weeks" during the NDA lift stream on May 14th, so it sounded to me like it took place a week earlier than that. But that could absolutely be wrong - I wasn't there lol :p
---
I had zero interest in playing classic until I watched one of his videos. Now I'm all hyped! Dammit Nostalgia! You are indeed one of the greatest human weaknesses!
---
Didn't he make that video about being against stream snipers a few days after he stream sniped Azmongold?
---
Then they would not find it as they would be sucked in hotpocket mountaindew pithole of playing 18hrs a day
---
If you don‚Äôt sleep - sure.
---
IIRC from the various post, is something along the lines of 16 hours per day for various weeks with premades organized just to let you farm honor
---
Nope sorry, top 1 person can get 13k a week, if they remain number 1
---
Idk bro. A Shaman in t2 is sexy as hell as a Tauren
---
Jesus everyone quit the beta. Blizzard please invite more of us...

As is tradition

I'm not an expert but it looks like a healing spec where you also have some ability to so some elemental damage at the same time.
---
Having played WoW in Vanilla into Cata, I dabbled in all classes.  Had ever one maxed into Cata/MoP.
---
Never tried warrior.
---
What they say is so fucking true.  Leveling on private server as warrior and it‚Äôs like a new hard mode I discovered.  Shit is so fucking hard.
---
Anything more then 1 mob and I die.  Threat gen sucks balls.  Trying to level alchemy but even double elixir with a health pot and it‚Äôs 50/50 whether I die pulling 2 mobs.
---
Literally watching mages and priests face tank 2-3.
---
Yes, this happens often, especially for fights that drag on for minutes at a time. There's a mix of this and fights I complete 100 myself in this video. However, even the ones where someone intervenes, it's pretty clear I've got it in the bag. Besides, it's actually pretty humorous. You may have missed the night Slayer rogue I got down to 15% before a low level band of 30s helped finish him off. Talk about adding insult to injury üòÇ
---
Rent in Orgimmar is skyrocketing thanks to the tech boom.
---
While I'd like for the old AV to come back, they have already made the decision not to bring it back. Complaining now is just too late, they're just doing bugfixing for the last stretch. This was a battle that would have needed fighting back when they first announced that it would be 1.12 av.
---
Bruh... did the legit same thing haha
---
Then buy a CRT monitor, turn your settings to low, and run a stress test in the background when you play.
---
well done!
---
i think the idea that streamers would pick a server and stay on that and have a horde streamer server and alliance streamer server.
---
so people can chose to pe a part of that community which is around streaming or just pick another server. 
---
so not having a "streaming" server but streamers just taking over a server
---
Rank 14 is not something you just grind for. You will need to join a team and they'll dictate how much you have to play.
---
The high ranks are all controlled by all the premade groups. They purposefully only do a certain amount of PVP each week and then let the chosen ones do a bit more so they'd hit that 0.2% threshold and hit rank 14.
---
Unless you're part of their team (and they played a ton each day), then you're very unlikely to reach rank 14 without playing an unreasonable amount. And since the most efficient way to farm honor is in premades, you won't do it even if you play 20+ hours a day.
---
The minimum amount of time to reach rank 14 is 12 weeks, and that's only if you're the highest contributing member of your faction every week. It's unlikely we'll see a rank 14 on any server for the first 4-5 months of the Honor system.
---
Try it as a shockadin.
---
I feel like streaming WoW classic beta and being a Chad are mutually exclusive tbh
---
Madseason
---
Which streamer "loves" layering? The closest I've heard is necessary evil argument that does make sense.
---
I am not sure what they will do but I doubt that would be the justification. Legions of rabid fans have been unearthing details recreating this experience for a really long time. They have played it over and over and are still playing it. I bet many if not streamers in the beta like myself played classic and or pservers too. Doesnt matter if they've been to 60 then or now at release I know I will be doing it all again.
---
Oh, i didnt realise this, thanks for letting me know. Ive only been using it and cross referencing with a wiki to check for any patch updates to stuff
---
LEERERRRROOOYYYY JENKINSSSS!!!
---
That is one of my favorite all-time old school memories. I had met this guy near the end of classic and so I had no idea what it really meant, he was apparently a Scarab Lord. He showed me the ropes and took me around the world to see the coolest things and one of the coolest was going to this arena in dire Maul and it was packed with horde and Alliance sitting in a circle while individuals fought in the middle. I was like a lowly 42 and it was the coolest thing ever, and he's a good friend of mine today and we are both stoked to experience this again, haha.
---
Soil, Linkin Park, Bullet for my Valentine, Slipknot, Drowning Pool
---
As far as I can tell, that rogue may as well have been a poorly coded bot.
---
There is always the mind control ambush from shadowmeld to sweeten the deal.
---
1.12 still has elites that hit hard.... mines... and towers. 
---
There's enough time to summon bosses as well. 
---
Seems like a non issue
---
Old vanilla nobody new what to expect.  You leveled paladins not knowing they could only heal in raids.  You played night elves because they were cool.
---
Private servers have the edge of drawing an elite dedicated player base.  Night elves just suck compared to other races.
---
Classic will probably find a middle ground.  Personally I like to min max gear/talents but will take a racial trade off in favor of flavor.  I don‚Äôt PVP but think undead rogues are just so fucking cool.  Same with night elf warriors.  I‚Äôll give up the stun resist or +5 in swords just to get a character I can enjoy looking at.
---
i know kung-fu
---
It's a competition of time invested, so if there's anyone on your server that doesn't have a job and wants it you don't stand a chance. Ofc eventually all the those people will get it, and you might finally have a chance, but that's gonna be quite a long time down the line. 
---
As for how much time it takes to get there, I don't quite remember. I do know that towards the end it takes several weeks of being #1 though. Like, it's probably somewhere close to a two or three month grind total.
---
I wonder if somebody on a server were to organise a 'National No Zerg Day' whether players from both factions would adhere to it, purely for nostalgia and fun. I remember the community spirits of my servers back in the day, correct etiquette during certain events would be respected by both factions.
---
I might look into organising this.
---
The notice of the meeting went out more than a week before the meeting. The meeting was on May 8th.
---
They still have to test AV so it should go into the 50s, yeah?
---
Thanks for explaining it way more thoroughly than me :)
---
What's your opinion on honor system being in potentially 2,3,4 months before bgs?
---
Think that adds a crazy meta on pvp servers that open world is just 100% uptime since that's the only way to grab honor?
---
Back then... you went to bed and got up, and sometimes for 2 days or longer the same AV would still be going on... and I honestly thought it was fun and outside of some world PvP it was the most fun I have ever had in WoW's PvP.
---
I was there from beta and day one and I'm curious if anyone remembers the patch that made it so you auto targeted anyone who damaged you?
---
Cause for the longest time during those AV that lasted for days, you could hide in bushes and behind stuff and snipe and not be targeted by the person automatic... damn it was so crazy back then.
---
I want to play a warlock and warlock raiding without blessing of salvation is not going to be pleasant.
---
Meet people. Make friends. Run dungeons with those laid back friendly people. Figure out what you want from classic. It's going to be a good time no matter what your experience level.
---
If only there were fairly accurate private experiences that could fill that role. There are.
---
Can some1 explain me the problem with streamers ?!  I read that a lot but no one says why
---
Most casuals will only need first aid if they‚Äôre a non healing class.
---
Source:  was casual in vanilla
---
My word that is a lot of item to go though, this may take awhile haha, thank you though

Skilled druid player.
---
Yeah, he has ZG gear, he has flasks.
---
Still hitting for up to 3500 in a single burst. Without using a CD. Scarier then an Ele shaman. Minus the spammable purge, totem utility and healing ofcourse.
---
lol well have fun leveling for a year
---
Preparing for downvotes here but imo they are either need really heavy lore restrictions on what races can be what or they just need no restrictions at all.
---
A few, yes. Others are also assumed or overblown based off very few incidents over ~8 years of happenings.
---
These overblown ones are the ones people freak out about, citing repeatedly. It‚Äôs not nearly going to be that bad, since it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt much of an issue (if at all, for some) prior. Precedence holds weight.
---
being mad about habitual stream snipers getting blacklisted is pathetic.
---
I'm not a huge fan of watching streams, but I really like perplexity. He's funny, down to earth, interacts with the chat as if it's a conversation, and is just generally entertaining while actually playing the game (unlike other streamers who seemingly just want to do publicity stunts).
---
I'm talking about pristine hide specifically though, I'm sure it had some funny business going on.
---
See I remember this, do you remember when you could damage the enemy and they not auto target you?
---
Damn gnomes and hiding in bushes dotting people left and right!
---
I feel you, the xpacs kinda went that path from tbc I think it would've been hard for them to stop, I think overall the wow story telling is shit like the Warcraft lore is so fucking intricate they could make the game sick
---
You also have to know fights.  Like in depth know your positioning and timing.
---
Also, be able to handle the spotlight.  Everyone will know if you fuck up.  You have to be able to laugh it off.
---
To decurse the raid.
---
Aaand to make fun of people who died.
---
I haven't felt their presence so far. I've seen like two of them and they weren't very well known.
---
Why are you commenting this on a PvP video?
---
My name is not Stan tho
---
I got kodo in the back.
---
As im not 100% if you can actually do this after a patch, i gave a you a silver medal in the hopes people will see this and read it
---
Thus us mostly funny because it's true

---
Feral cat dps was my spec all through Wrath, and I loved it :) First expac where I actually got to raid. That rotation was so engaging for every single fight... such a challenge keeping it up. Powershifting appeals to me for a similar reason (somehow cat has been blessed with some of the most interesting rotations ingame, throughout its history) but I'm on the fence for the same reasons you are. Still, being a powerful tank/off tank who can also switch to decent dps wouldn't be so bad.
---
Also thinking of HotW spec for tanking and healing.
---
It's worth mentioning, though, that if you don't want to push the absolute top numbers you and everybody else can probably do sufficient DPS with just average levels of farming, consumes, etc. From what I understand of the damage ranges and the dps required on bosses (Patchwerk you only need to clear 400 dps per player, I think, and that's not even counting tanks) you can absolutely clear content without having to go overboard.
---
https://youtu.be/BcGG9VPagLM
---
It‚Äôs pretty simple. They are jelous that they get handouts just for being a streamer
---
Why are you gatekeeping people so hard man? 
---
Just let people play the game jfc.
---
I will be adding the rest of these items now, i was viewing them as how you described there uses but after thinking about it, they could be useful in other situations too
---
Yh traumas difficult to reel from, jokes aside me too... Me too...
---
It matters less than you think. If it gets bad, then all it means us wpvp over lotus spawns becomes more viable, for example.
---
You would be right
---
&gt; We do not fear what lies beneath
---
&gt; We can never dig too deep
---
Well that turned out to be a lie.
---
I mean, with the exception of McConnell spamming TWITCH PRIME TWITCH PRIME... occasionally in Asmongold's stream, and a couple of Esfand streams when he's really really close to a pretty substantial sub goal, I've never experienced what you're talking about. Go check out Esfand, StaySafeTV, TipsOutBaby, Guzu, Savix, Payo, etc. unless those are all guys you're talking about
---
Combat. +hit talents. Kill one mob at a time. Stick with a certain typw of weapon and get skilled at it. Rogues aren't even that slow as long as you're methodical about it.
---
I'll just say this... in this patch where rogues couldn't vanish to remove hunters mark, if my scatter/concussive shot landed when they used sprint, and so long as I didn't get close enough to get blinded, there is literally nothing a rogue can do to avoid this from happening.
---
Yes private servers severely overestimated the difficulty of the game. It's still hard but if you know what you're doing it's a lot easier, I soloed a lvl25 mob on my lvl21 warrior the other day for example.
---
Back in 2005 we were all noobs so it felt harder.
---
Lol yup, don't remember when it was changed but loved it
---
The question you have to ask yourself first is: how much is that 9-5 worth to you?
---
They are very different, and it's about the journey.
---
People have plans because they've already gone through the journey once. When it comes out just jump in and have fun! Game progresses slow so you'll figure out what you're doing as you go.
---
My brother and I kind of had a falling out during our high school days. He at one point told his fianc√© that he hated me. Since learning about Classic, he and I have reconnected, started talking more and more.
---
These are the kinds of experiences that WoW Classic are all about.
---
He literally chased you through the entire zone. All he needed to do was go the other way. Again, this might as well have been a poorly coded bot.
---
But That‚Äôs bullshit. Then I can also be jealous that they play video games all day and get paid for it 
---
Or is there a deeper reason behind that 
---
I mean if someone wants to give his items to a streamer it‚Äôs ok as long as they don‚Äôt demand a special treatment from me ?!
---
this is dope, i can see earthfury looking sick as well
---
When is this exactly? The amount of money in the total economy has increased a lot, therefore WoW Token prices have gone up a lot. I would assume back then it was more difficult to get 45k than it is today.
---
Metal Dorfs
---
Just tagging mobs in a crowded starting zone is technically better, but exploring is at least more satisfying, so I'd say it's not stupid at the very least.
---
If it was just a time grind more people would get it.
---
The issue people are having is it's hard to prove someone stream sniped. It happens in other games all the time, someone gets killed and the first thing they go to is "they are stream sniping!".
---
If a player is running through a zone and happens to kill a streamer, they should be blacklisted by the server community for it? That's the problem.
---
The same streamer calling for a blacklist also said something very very anti what he is preaching now when talking about stream sniping.
---

---
Weapon speed affects the contribution from ap in vanilla, which is why that's not a thing that people commonly do.
---
Good job
---
Ah so you didn't play back then. Yes I can understand why you wouldn't think so, private servers sure as hell can't because they overpopulate them so much that the community can't self police.
---
There you go then. Make friends, play with people
---
I still have the reagent to cast greater blessings and the symbol of divinity to cast Divine Intervention. 
---
I still have my Verigan's Fist with its +3 weapon damage enchant. 
---
I think the rarest thing I still have on my Paldin is the Divination Scryer from the quest to get the charger.
---
Unfortunately rank 14 will most likely be dominated by account sharers, and there is very little chance you will get there without doing the same.  But give it a shot dude, you never know.
---
If you truly payed attention, he tried that a few times... As did most rogues in this video. All I had to do was turn back and follow...
---
I liked Spine + the ground fight, but felt kind of weird as the final boss of an expansion. I think it might have been better if they combined spine + ground into one fight (shorten them together) and then some kind of Aspect fight where you have a singular target
---
He also once said that Streamers should get shit for not having pvp toggled on, and they should just suffer.
---
As someone who doesn't watch twitch (ill sometimes catch highlights when its put on youtube if it show sup on my recommended) I don't understand the hatred people have for them. I mean logically any adult should be able to understand why they get priority over stuff for marketing reasons, which leads to the idea of bitterness being the only reason.
---
Druid main, Warlock alt for me haha.
---
What is Resto like for pvp? I'm split between Resto and Feral and I don't imagine they hybridize well.
---
It's not their fault that Azeroth has world ending stuff lying around in every nook and cranny.
---
Sometimes you cant make two steps without awakening some Old God and needing to throw bodies at it with the promise of loot, money and fame until it stops being a problem.
---
Yeah, when looking back at these old screenshoots I remember that we all had smaller screens back then.
---
then you should not be playing games or expecting to have an input on something designed specifically to take a lot of time to grind out...that is what retail is for.
---
??? Can you read what I wrote? Adderall is not meth, it's amphetamine, which still is a hard drug.
---
Yeah but he also said streamers should be pvp toggled on and just suffer. This would fall under the latter. You stream, so you should just suffer through it.
---
People love a good circlejerk tho!
---
You mean WHEN they start abusing the blacklist for minor gripes and affronts they percieve.
---
It's very likely I'll have access to a team. 
---
&gt;The minimum amount of time to reach rank 14 is 12 weeks
---
Where are you getting the 12 week number? And the 0.2%?
---
I totally understand it's not just a time sink, and that it's relative/competitive, but I assume there's math that prevents you from jumping X ranks in 1 week.
---
you're old for reddit or gaming standards, yes. that doesn't matter though :) I was like 8 when I played vanilla lmao, lookin forward to playing it at an age where I can properly understand what's going on.
---
This is what I did with the stress test. So far I got it to look like this: https://imgur.com/a/VXneRqx
---
Still need a metamap like addon so I can have the worldmap not taking up my whole UI and Skinner needs to be updated so I can give all UI frames a slick look.
---
Good video with good points 
---
But shouldn‚Äôt it be also in the interest of the streamer then to hide the identity of characters and server then 
---
Also the last sentence he said 
---
Mind your own business is very Important
---
Only on this subreddit
---
But they do demand special treatment from everyone. If your on their stream or in their raid they expect you to do exactly what they ask of you. Look at asmon, he literally cracks it because McConnell asks for gold and tells everyone to stop and trade him gold instead. He always wants the special treatment. 
---
I‚Äôm a fan but I‚Äôd never want to be around him In game
---
sorry but payo is pretty obnoxious/annoying sometimes. I'm sure he would agree with this himself.
---
The only thing I can immediately think of is maybe the scarab lord quest will be made easier for them? Honestly there aren‚Äôt very many streamers who will receive insane world drop items for free and many of those will probably reject them.
---
in addition 1.5 AV to feel 1.5 would need 1.5 talents/abilities. e.g Warriors intimidating shout had NO CAP on the number of people feared, it was insane fearing 20+ people with one button, lagged like crazy when pressed. Made capping/pushing super hard.
---
He's Dutch I believe.
---
Probably less Humans too
---
Lol bro AV will still last a long time. If you legit want it to last 12+ hours you need help
---
lol
---
Sure if you get your hands on r14 gear before you need want to AoE grind for your mount.
---
‚ÄúIs it illegal to be in here‚Äù
---
Sucks because all my old screenshots from when I started in tbc were lost after xfire changed. I love seeing all these old screenshots though.
---
-50dkp to Terru and Tetra.
---
I second this :)
---
A flasked moonkin with ZG gear.  
---
Wouldn't a true phase 1 be oom after the first big hit?  Yea, the big hits will happen, but if you focus entirely on +damage gear then you are kind of a 1 hit wonder.  I suppose to some that could be funny.
---
Except this isn't a phase 1 moonkin, so I don't really see the point.
---
Yeah teamviewer is alot slower
---
Good looking zone with good music.  
---
Honestly.. never liked the actual questing there though.
---
Try Google you questions, the old honor system is well document. Assuming it will be the same system this time it is easy to find.
---
https://m.youtube.com ‚Ä∫ watch
---
Classic WoW Honor System Explained - ...
---
Unless huge groups coordinate pseudo-battlegrounds and basically just trade honor all day (they can kill each other 10 times until it‚Äôs worthless), it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll be anyone with a rank above 9 before BGs release. It will take the top earner a minimum of 5 weeks at level 60 to reach it, and that‚Äôs only if they‚Äôre the top earner each week AND have enough CP.
---
I‚Äôm more curious on whether R14 is even going to be possible on some servers. If your faction does t have enough contributors, it‚Äôs impossible for anyone to hit the rank and this happened several times in Vanilla. With what we understand now about how difficult the grind is and how crap the blue gear is, why should people do BGs at all? If that happens, the premades are fucked and will never reach rank.
---
yes maybe   
---
my opinion about streames is a bit splitted 
---
it can be a blessing when they bring a population on the server maybe a community a strong guild etc.   
---
but it can also be a curse when they do exactly these things you mentioned and/or leave the server 
---
so it depends hard on the streamer if its going to be hell or heaven on the server they play on .
---
i think ill pick a server on the feeling in my stomach and if it sucks it sucks and i have to switch or accept it
---
anyways its still a long time until that decission and maybe the plot will twist until then
---
It would be quite different for well known streamers. I‚Äôm sure the big ones could tell their followers ‚Äúbut X item out of AH constantly and hold it/gift it to me‚Äù and they all would either drive prices up to profit or feed the streamer all the mats
---
Lol, who the fuck plays a Night Elf warrior anyway. Totally insufficent.
---
They already confirmed it isn't changing.  We aren't getting the old AV.
---
As you said, it wont be as bad as future versions anyway.  You can still summon things and that will still happen.  Turtles will still happen constantly until a series of summons (or big boss summon) happen to push forward.
---
Western Plague Lands!
---
Fuck no. I do not want those asses hiding behind that bugged mountain wall in pugs and noone finds them.
---
Showing them is a good idea. At least after some time.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if some no-life plays all day. Premades decide who gets rank 14. They‚Äôll have more honor per hour than any solo player can match and will choose amongst themselves who gets to go up that week.
---
Good point on pops, will be interesting to see how they balance out after January
---
Bless you, follower boomer
---
Not account sharers, premades. Every week, the premade will pick a person to go up to R14. If you‚Äôre not part of the premade, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many people you have playing your account.
---
Well from my perspective to farm instances
---
I don‚Äôt mind brining a  protadin that goes the extra mile with regents and buffs.  
---
Same goes with Retardin or a boomkin.   
---
I tries to avoid bias thinking can you prove your worth to the raid then your spot is given.  
---
A protadin/retardin/boomkin will have to work ALOT harder then a holy paladin.
---
"the person who made this poll" wasn't an option?
---
Probably has to do with dx 11 or 12 being involved
---
Just like with any other game that has already been played out, there will be many who expect more people to already know what to do.  
---
Same has happened on the recent city of heroes private servers; everyone on them (and there are tens of thousands at least) knows the ins and the outs of the game and wont assume someone is new.
---
Same when OSRS hit.  It was all veteran runescape players and everyone knew which skills to focus on first, which items would be high value, and the market was completely changed because of it (at first).  
---
Bottom line is that it is a reality.  You either let it bother you or you don't.  Play the game, and if you feel like you are the only one in a dungeon not knowing anything, then just type it out and let everyone know.  Most people aren't going to condemn you for simply needing to learn.
---
How are they going to find bugs if they don‚Äôt have beta testers to play it at the higher levels?
---
I think (a small amount) of inflation is a good thing. While the game progresses it would be nice that the people that won't go for end game stuff, would still have several ways to get some gold to afford the most important expense - your epic mount. What I mean is that with some inflation, the prices of leathers, cloths and fish will go up, while at the same time the cost of the epic mount will stay the same. Therefore obtaining your epic mount will become easier over time.
---
Anyone here have experience with 240? I just splurged on the Razer with 240hz refresh rate and I feel I may have been overkill since I only play wow.
---
Are you sure? 10-15 year old microwaves have this.
---
Today /u/HotXWire discovered metaphor
---
Bottom line is that 7.5 million concurrent players were there by the end of vanilla.  A lot of people returning will likely have played it or TBC at the very least and will have some degree of experience/knowledge.  
---
Doesn't mean he shouldn't play, but I think looking at this realistically is the best bet.
---
This looks much more realistic class distribution than all the polls so far.
---
I'm using this as a copypasta. Best read in a while, fucking died at the fear ward marriage!
---
That would get my vote
---
Me cargo en tu puta madre
---
I am sure they will go up to 60.  I doubt there will be raid testing though; going to assume that will be in house.
---
The amount of odd questing bugs found so far have been rather high, so why would they forgo testing the higher levels.  It isn't like they are new or anything.
---
Yes, you can only get a certain amount of Ranking Points per week, so there‚Äôs a minimum amount of time to hit each rank even if you‚Äôre number one every week.
---
The 0.2% number is also well documented, along with the other charts and formulas. I‚Äôm on mobile now but it‚Äôs not hard to find.
---
And understand, it‚Äôs not good enough to be part of a team, you need to be part of THE team. They‚Äôll do whatever it takes to keep the high ranks to themselves. People think selling raid gear to the highest bidder is bad, just wait until the Vanilla PVP cartels come back.
---
Still without the killcounter. So all it takes is ten guys defending a graveyard to turn it into a regular AV. Ah, the complaints bakc then if you didn't like the 5 minutes riding and then 2 mins boss bashing experience.
---
Luxthos
---
He used to have at least one pic of himself on twitter, maybe a year ago or so. I remember that he was ripped, but he took it down.
---
What is there to save?  By the end of vanilla there were 7.5 million concurrent players.  
---
It is nothing new, and even if private servers end up being very wrong on a lot of values, the runs are still close enough and many have been playing on those pservers who will be coming to classic.  There is nothing to hide, but a lot to test.
---
Raids will probably be like they've always been.  Completely tested in house.
---
What are you on about? It's perfectly viable to level with AoE grinding starting at level 22, and you don't need any sort of shield to do it.
---
No way will they publicly test raids, but I am very certain they will test questing up to 60.
---
It is going to be a lot easier this time around either way.  There is nothing to hide, and even if private servers had incorrect values, they are still going to end up being close enough and there are tons of videos out there from them.  
---
THis isn't a new game.
---
lazy ass post
---
I'd do spiritual focus for less kickback when aoe farming but that's just me
---
Um.. isn't that what he said?
---
Just make a guild that specializeze in corpse camping streamers.
---
GOTEEM
---
Ill explain.
---
Many don't care about the end result.
---
The old AV wasnt amazing just because it lasted longer, but because there was significantly more ways and things for your team to accomplish. It also was unique in a sense that it basically a wintergrasp/tol barad esque battleground, where the server you're in would duke it out on a huge scale, and where you could opt in for the same bg the next day or something.
---
The design philosophy shifting to wanting it to be a battleground as quick as wsg and ab was not what it was built for in the first place, and they literally had to cut out gameplay elements of it to be just that.
---
Its baffling to me. Like removing siege engines and the caste gate in a castle siege game, so it would end faster.
---
its not like the internet never forgets or something.
---
If you want to MT, then you need to be there at the formation of a guild or stick around long enough for the first MT to stop raiding/quit.
---
The first person in a raiding guild upon forming will always get the role if they requested it.  I've never heard of any other way for it to happen without said MT causing major issues.
---
I‚Äôm literally doing the same thing. Me and the boys have a sleep schedule and my wife is taking our son to stay at her parents.
---
Go gnome or go home, nothing tilts hordies more than a little anklebiter putting them on their ass
---
MT typically gets thunderfury for one.
---
Not quite the minority; I don't care about getting beta access, but don't watch streams or anything else; my only involvement with classic WoW atm is this subreddit.
---
I'd prefer to play hard once it actually launches. I don't quite get the fascination of getting beta access currently.
---
Who's to say the no-lifer doesn't have a team ? if you both play pre-mades 7-8 hours per day, but he also pugs for a good 5-6 hours you don't stand a chance at all.
---
Not warrior
---
Streamers are worse than hitler right now according to the poll.
---
There isn't as much of a need as some of you think man. 
---
You need 1 MT, and maybe a back up OT, and the misc off tanking can be done by ferals or DPS warriors for the entire 40 man.  Contrasted to TBC with 25 man raids needing 2-3 main tanks, it is a completely different ball game.  
---
The guy wants to MT, and the bottom line is that you don't earn that role, you basically just need to be there upon a guild forming or the MT leaving for whatever reason.
---
Though that may be his unspoken role, he‚Äôs still in it as a tester (despite his dickhead remark). He should be doing his due diligence. Even if he‚Äôs ‚Äúproviding plenty of testing data for the devs‚Äù, many bugs aren‚Äôt apparent from an outside view and reports are necessary to get it fixed.
---
"Stop enjoying things"
---
Sure ok bud
---
1.12 BRE is well documented, it procs like crazy, even with half the proc rate used on private servers it would beat our Hand of Rag easily
---
Hunters are generally the fastest levelers and very appreciated in dungeons.
---
Stop posting your shitty ass twitch.
---
I feel like going after streamers would make for some good pvp since they'll have a squad with them. You bring some homies and just have a nice battle
---
Great choice! I play tauren druid on private server and I fucking love their starting zone. Sure, it's a little more running so a little slower to level, but it makes up for it with relatively easy quests, great visuals and the amazing soundtrack.
---
The tauren themselves are also very fun! War stomp allows feral druids to pull off some stupid things in pvp, and it's invaluable as a resto/balance to save your ass from a tough situation.
---
Tailoring is fine, but you don't need it while leveling. You don't really need armor because of PW:Shield and the stats don't matter except for spirit. It does work well with enchanting though and a good wand is priceless.
---
You can't earn the position what so ever.  You can only be the designated OT who fills the position of the MT who leaves the guild or stops raiding.  
---
And becoming either one of those roles is going to be tough to do, as now everyone knows who gets priority for thunderfury.  If you aren't there from the formation of the guild, then the odds are extremely low.
---
:|
---
Very torn,  part of me wants alliance for a super fresh experience and their comfy af city's (looking at you ironforge)
---
or to go with true and tested horde, i cant lie my heart is very much with the horde and it will be strange being an alliance if if i do go that way!
---
If there's no oceanic servers I'll eat my hat
---
A meme is never dead as long as people put effort into them.
---
Yes. Everyone coming to classic should learn from my error. Praise Jame!
---
Please not let this subreddit become r/art too :(
---
&gt; troll if elemental
---
It isn't much of a difference. The GCD isn't reduced by berserking so you'll never cast spells faster than every 1.5 seconds regardless of how short your LB casts get. Berserking is huge for resto though.
---
Agreed.  
---
There is no real way to earn the position other than the previous MT just not raiding/quitting the guild.  
---
Doesn't help that when a MT leaves a guild, there are usually other people who follow.
---
You should play the class you want to play. But hunter and warlock would be fast and easy to level. Or mabby even mage aoe grinding because you will be behind the curve.
---
It offered all-day pseudo-WPvP. Break off with a group of 4 friends and try to back-cap a graveyard, or catch people in the Field of Strife, or work your way around the having fun.
---
By the same logic you could ask why anyone would ever participate in TM vs Southshore since there weren't any BG rewards for it.
---
more like:
---
Sodapoppin on bike
---
and "FUCKING STREAM SNIPERS"
---
as someone who has no issues with anything streamers are doing and thinks it's really fun to have them around/enjoys watching the content...
---
This meme makes absolutely no sense for this situation
---
4 man raids?
---
And go hunter.
---
Lol ya I heard they the slowest lovers.
---
Thunderfury.
---
4 level is nothing in vanilla. This is world pvp, not tanking or grey killing
---
Artificial Valley... how nostalgic.
---
What was your name? What guild did you join?
---
4 man dungeons whatever its called?
---
The harassment one has already occurred for myself and I‚Äôm not even in the beta...
---
Haha ! Getting money from that gold farmer...so you dont tell anyone hes a bot or something XD
---
Check Parsec, it's especially made for what you're trying to achieve.
---
I myself use Shadow.tech, which is a service providing high end gaming pc for remote use, but as you already have your own battlestation, Parsec is more suited for your need.
---
Chill af.

---
Name should be obvious.
---
Yes, they go gently in and out until pie
---
or streamers could just fuck off and take their horde of asshole fanboys with them.
---
gotta acknowledge, there will be players who won't be able to avoid the streamer and end up on his server. Say this player is 100% innocent, not stream sniping but kills him and maybe camped him 2-3 times, not knowingly he is a streamer. 
---
The streamer may make a call to his other streamer friends from the opposing faction and inform them to blacklist that player. 
---
The streamer who was grief, while not promoting or indicating his fans to harass said player - his fans will undoubtly harass this player. 
---
Some streamers assumes, anytime they get ganked it's because they were stream sniped, even when it wasn't.
---
You can see evidence of this in many FPS streamers bitching how they got hacked/stream sniped when they were just outplayed.
---
Start selling them! I'll buy one for sure! Especially if there's different zones available
---
Ya go Hunter:)
---
Play a warrior.  Warriors all love each other.
---
I kinda agree he needs to nut up a bit and deal with it. Hell he's got a private army watching him ay all times that can chase off any  campers.
---
Blacklists however have always been a thing. Ninjas, mats  theifs always got called out and before LFG don't tell me you wouldn't avoid certain players and guilds because you knew they were shit .
---
Lol fixed if stupid spell check
---
Why not take Imp devotion instead of Redoubt? Like you said crits could be viewed as less of an issue in dungeons so would the eight points from Redoubt and Shield specialization be better used elsewhere, say Imp devotion aura and Anticipation/BoK? (Ofc if you can proc Redoubt with /sit then it makes sense)
---
I got almost the same plan as you. Pally tanking and healing when lvling and IF I have time to raid then holy. Otherwise I will just keep on healing and tanking dungeons.
---
With engineer mining?
---
Xaryu is fun to watch.
---
10/10, expected "streamers" to be#1, it was Trump.
---
you don't have to roll on a RP server if you think it's "yikes".
---
You're gonna need a lot more than just a few days of vacation lol. I made it to rank 12 by myself and one friend by murdering many players and carrying/winning WSG. To hit 14 you'll need a group and more time than anyone should spend. You can't hit 14 with a job. WoW has to be your job.
---
If Ion Hazzikostas and Macaulay Culkin had a gnomish baby.

Nicely Photoshoped :)
---
With the sharding system, they won't even effect you on their own servers, tbh. Anyone complaining about the streamer beenfits, which are absolutely there and real, not denying that, act like there won't be normal guilds out there all feeding one guy just like a streamer. If you aren't with a huge group and plan out big shit, you aren't getting world first in anything and streamers not being there wouldn't increase their chances.
---
There's an argument for the economy. Abuse is possible, but Blizzard will also punish very easy to see abuse. If a streamer tells their stream to buy all of a product, they are getting banned for that. That is provable manipulation of the AH. If their followers just decide to instantly buy the shit they put on the AH though without them asking for it, and they end up driving the prices down or up, there's nothing Blizzard can do about that and even the possibility of that stuff is why I won't be playing on a streamer server, but I don't hate or blame the streamers themselves. That's just the world we live in now and it's not going away. We can bring the games back exactly as they were decades ago, but we can't bring the people, their mentalities and sites/programs outside of the game back or exclude new developments to get the same experience back. 
---
Classic WoW is not Vanilla WoW. Vanilla WoW is dead, all we are getting is the aesthetic shell that was Vanilla WoW. It was filled with the players and mentalities of the past that just don't exist anymore and that is what made it what it was. It will still be fun, I think it was a more fun design for sure, but anyone expecting the past to be exactly like it was is in for a rude awakening.
---
yeah. it's almost brand new too.
---
it's not an expensive microwave by any means though.
---
I don't remember inflation even being remotely an issue until wrath.
---
If anything might cause some problems, it would be having up to 3 instances of places like hearthglen being AoE farmed, generating some insane amounts of gold into the world a lot sooner.   Layering is going to impact the economy quite a bit, especially if they don't end up dropping it.
---
He wants redoubt for blessing of sancturary reflect damage, also he will frequently be running ret aura over devo.
---
Simplified version is that if you are the top honor earner on your server on your faction you get standing #1 that week. Standing #1 rewards you with 13k Rating Points each week, the amount of points you have is your current rank. Get 60k Rating Points for to get R14. The problem is that your Rating Points (rank) also decay 20% each week, so for example if you are at the edge of R13 you have 55k Rating Points, that decays to 44k and then add the 13k to end up at 57k.
---
I think it'll be removed for Rules 1, 3, 5, 7.
---
Mhh parsec is not open source, which is a bit tricky isn‚Äôt it?
---
Ye because cc only works for set duration. Completely unthinkable that u get hit by a small 6-8 sec slow and then your opponent runs to get distance for reset. We are talking about wpvp after all i heard it works like an mma cage match, once u start fighting u are supposed to stand still and melee with a staff.
---
On my server the old cartel actually got pushed out by a fresh blood pvp group that was actually better pvpers.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I've seen the premade get pushed out by another, better premade.
---
Found the non-streamer.
---
Well. Thanks for the nightmare fuel.
---
&gt; I don't think healing in classic is boring regardless of class.
---
All classes are like this. Downranking heal and mashing it over and over again, as most HoT's require a ton of +healing to be efficient.
---
And yeah it's not really that boring, there's wak-a-mole as AOE heals suck.
---
Holy fuck, vanilla yoghurt?! How long did you search for this treasure?
---
But it was amazing 14 years ago
---
Don't forget though that Method is more of a brand / business these days than a wow guild. 
---
I think even Esfans is Method now, but he has nothing to do with the WF Guild on EU. Their "huge plans" could be anything, their WF guild members could go hard in Classic (although i think a few already said this wouldn't be the case, as the WF's were done 15 years ago), They could go pretty big with Esfand and other streamers i guess (but in NA, not EU), they could sign a roster to run a hardcore classic guild in either EU or NA. They have quite the options i reckon.

Talesavogg on twitch

An actual adult, chill guy. Also very knowledgeable about warriors and paladins. Currently top warrior DPS in naxx across all private servers, even without Gressil. 
---
Plays both orc and human warrior on pservers, raids naxx with both. As far as I know he‚Äôll do the same in classic. 
---
Monkeynews is kinda the same, but more focused on group and pvp content in addition to pve. Too bad APES aren‚Äôt playing on US, if there‚Äôs a guild or group of players that will make any streamer quit the game, it‚Äôs these guys.
---
After a couple of years, when your server dies off a bit, rank gear becomes useless, people essentially stop ranking and only a handful of casual PvPers remain, R14 might become possible for someone with 9-5 job.
---
Everything in the 19 bracket feels like crap when compared to hunters.  Honestly, this doesn't really change until the 49.
---
Hate and Anger are to strong for people to control sometimes -hunting streamers.
---
Double druid must be the best team for stealth runs though? Healer + tank should enable you to take on more bosses?
---
The title could be used for a master thesis
---
You find good streams scrolling down the page to the 100 or less viewers streams. There are so many great streamers. Like YouTube, there are great channels that average 10,000 views on their vids and crap channels with 10,000,000.
---
Put in a few minutes to look and find people you like.
---
I mean you can get polyed and any other pet will get killed while you are cc‚Äôd.
---
Idk if you‚Äôve ever played warlock, but a void is overall the best pet for solo world pvp. A succubus isn‚Äôt bad for the seduce but the sac shield is helpful vs all classes.
---
&gt; Beta ends and all that progress will go away. 
---
This is why I don't understand the large fascination with the beta; why would people want to play hard in the beta now and lose all that progress in a little over 2 months instead of just waiting for release?
---
It's 5 man but yea hunter or even warrior tank

Go herb and alchemy then, tailor and alchemy makes no sense unless it's an alt
---
Divine Int is a really pisspoor talent while leveling.  You will have very little int on your gear, so for most of leveling those 5 talent points combined are worth less then 10 int.  5pts in imp SoR is basically 10% single target threat and damage.  
---
Basically if you think imp sotc is worth it for single target threat, then imp sor is by far better and passive so is useful whether or not you judge sotc.  
---
I would take out those points in imp sotc and fill out defensive to 1h spec, once again that is more threat then imp sotc provides and is 100% uptime.

If you play an hour every 2-3 days it doesn't really matter what class you play. Just pick the one you like the most.

I am just glad that warriors reign supreme.

Oh 5 man sorry see I'm so casual I dont even know this ü§£
---
YOU CAN REACH R14!! Though most probably will get banned in the proces.
---
 Account sharing and $$ was the key, in vanilla the honor system was fcked, and due to that the premades made a monopoly on it. There were gold, level, and honor rank selling Chinese sites. 
---
You are better off just chilling and enjoying the game in the time you have than to chase a futile goal.

You will have a guild mate that has alchemy or make a lvl 35 twink for transmute and alchemy. Go tailoring and enchanting. üëçüèª
---
Engineering is your best bet, honestly. The long term benefits of that profession greatly outweigh any of the others, in my opinion. As far as your second profession goes, that's more of a tossup. You mentioned Tailoring, Alchemy, and Enchanting, and those are all solid choices.
---
Well I was thinking about either going herb and alch or tailor and enchanting wasn't planning on mixing the two
---
That would have taken me a lot of time to find. Thank you! Will have a look and see if I can get it fixed.
---
I love AH, after Hillsbrad it's my primary reason why I am rolling Horde. I love the zone and Horde just has so much more in it than Ally.
---
Alchemy is a great go-to for any class if you're that unsure. For priests you'll be sourcing your own mana pots at the very least, and transmuting arcanite for profit which isn't bad at all.
---
Streamers make money from the things we do in our off time, and that REALLY PISSES US OFF
---
Imagine being bullied by asmon
---
I keep hearing that engineering is useful but mostly in pvp which I'm not really planning on doing much if any at all
---
The main thing that scares me about Balance Druids is that their spells come in indirectly. Starfire and Moonfire make it hard to track a target who's hiding effectively. That confusion and disorientation can give them just enough time to finish you off if you don't know which way to go.
---
The other rogue, r14 sword and brutality blade?
---
Nothing he said in that clip is related to this scenario or hypocritical. He thinks everyone should be PvP flagged at all times because he thinks that is an important part of WoW at its core. You can argue that's dumb, but it's just an opinion and not related to his anti-stream sniping blacklist in any way. I'd suggest you look up the definition of a strawman argument, because that is basically what you are making.
---
Everyone involved is childish. If he doesn't want to get sniped, he can turn off stream and to be honest with you, he will at certain points. And if you don't want to get put on his blacklist, don't stream snipe him. That's all there is to it. If he was actually asking Blizzard to ban people, we could have a discussion on how dumb he is, but since he's just making a blacklist for his friends that no one has to use, maybe grow up and act like an adult for once.
---
Great album, but holy shit, did nobody do some QC on this? (Go about 10-15 in and you'll see what I mean). Still, content overall is great.
---
That was the idea :)
---
im putting you in my list, with black paper and black ink, ill call it my blacklist
---
What made long AVs was not the version of the battleground it was the knowledge and mentality of the players if we would get 1.5 AV it would still be a fast AV ppl would just rush it anyway. So if you want longer games it is not the version you need to change it is the players
---
lmao i literally brought the same point in another post
---
The bicycle is a metaphor for fun/excitement.

fraudsoutbaby

Great feeling! :D
---
If you want to do raids as an uber casual then alliance warlock. Hunters don't get raid spots unless they know what they're doing and have good gear. Warlocks still level fast but can banish.
---
Go the class you enjoy most though, cause if you care you'll get spots in raids either way. And if not, because you don't have time to raid then go mage warlock or hunter for pvp options, or rogue for ganking people in wpvp.
---
how did the subreddit put something in its own spokes? Shit meme
---
Lol this is one of the changes that mattered.  People just mining/herbing/fishing without helping at all was pretty rage inducing to the rest of the team.  At least people killing NPCs in the mines were helping the team overall by buffing your teams NPCs.  Personally I think the happy medium was probably around patch 1.8.  Too bad we will probably never get it.
---
It depends on how active the ranking scene is on the server you play. On a very competitive server with lots of rankers it will be harder and require more of your time. Also it depends on the discipline of said rankers, if they break brackets etc. An old guildie of mine on N*stalrius (which had an extremely active ranking scene) claimed he had to play 15-18hour/day for 3 months to gain Rank14. Obviously he wasnt working or in school during that time. Realistically, I doubt you will be able to get Rank14 with a 9-5 job, even on a less active server.
---
Yea you are not allowed to bash streamers
---
If you are playing that limited then play what you want, class isn't going to change much with that super casual time. Who cares if it takes another week to get 60 or whatever the time may be ya know.
---
Didn't realise Neuro was playing! Neato!
---
Man those pally penis shoulders always made me laugh.  I hated wearing them as a pally but it was a necessary evil lol.
---
I don't think this is a very representative display of the balance pvp experience at all. It's just someone freecasting starfires into a group of unaware players. This will only work against inexperienced pvpers.
---
He's also not fully pvp speced. It's just someone running around with pve gear, dropping bombs on people who have no clue he's even there.
---
S'up yall. It's me. Your worst nightmare. Give me Your money or i'll gank Your noobass for days.

Your legs looks stupid. This shitty Shirt doesn't Match AT All with IT. Yeeeez this Belt, dude. You found IT in the garbage?

Nice hairs though. Ass

My predictions are they will go to 60 before the end and hopefully a final stress test that will be up for about a week and open ended
---
You're so mad about something that has no affect on you. shits pathetic how people think the world revolves around them.
---
Nice man! Giggle on the immolate cast
---
Damn old gods
---
You lack the critical information
---
Let's not ruin Mulgore with people.
---
I find that very hard to believe.
---
He isn't wanting to blacklist people for ganking him. He's wanting to blacklist people for knowing exactly where he revives, exactly where he is in stealth and being able to chase him across multiple zones to his exact location without being in sight of him. Something that can only be done by Stream Sniping. Stream Sniping =/= camping. 
---
One entire side's argument is a literal strawman defense for being able to stream snipe without suffering any consequences. The irony here is that everyone universally hated stream sniping and agreed it was a shitty thing to do before this, and yet they want to make an exception for Soda in Classic WoW because he is actually going to do something about it without involving or crying to Blizzard.
---
I think Soda is being childish for doing this because it's just going to cause an even bigger shitstorm and more griefing from people who don't care about being blacklisted, but he has every right to make a list if he wants, and everyone has a right to follow or ignore it if they want. But yall are acting even worse and crying even harder. Soda has literally done nothing to this sub or the game, but yall are the ones ruining an entire sub with your babyrage and blaming him for it, so grats on that, I guess.
---
My comment wasn't. :D
---
I understand
---
I only watch asmons stream cos his personality makes me want to bully him and it‚Äôs a good outlet for whatever emotion that is
---
Miss the jump several times
---
Create a guild with world first aspirations
---
Enchanting has the best long-term return of investment, especially if you are a class that's more suitable to get into dungeon-groups than for running around gathering stuff from resource-nodes.  
---
So it fits priest well.  
---
However, it is absolutely painfull to level compared with anything else.  
---
You'll find yourself having to actively look for people who will take your low-level enchants for free just to level it, basically burning money.  
---
If you are not also planning to spend a lot of time brokering in the AH, you'll eventually run into the situation where it's money for new spells/mount or enchanting.  
---
I'd say it's the most hardcore-profession that exists. But a huge advantage is that it's a standalone-profession that doesn't really require any other.  
---
That last bit is true for tailoring aswell. It is way easier to level but also not nearly as potent for the endgame.
---
Tbf tho imagine wow being your job. It sounds cool for a while but you gotta fkin edit videos too and stuff when you‚Äôd rather be playing, and gotta do all sorts of stupid shit to entertain your stream. And god forbid you‚Äôre not up to date with all the latest theorycraft or your audience would rip your noob ass to shreds. And if you wanna take a break, tough shit, that‚Äôs your livelihood lol 
---
And your pay probably isn‚Äôt that great tbh... there‚Äôs some perks but it definitely ain‚Äôt for me.
---
Excellent point mate, part of Mulgores charm is it‚Äôs tranquility. People would only ruin that, you‚Äôre right.
---
Then don't play on their server? You guys act like it's impossible to avoid killing a streamer, following them across multiple zones while they are in stealth and chain camp their ghost on accident. I'm not saying they can't or won't abuse a blacklist, but they can't mistakenly put you on the blacklist if you aren't there, and it's not hard to tell who is overtly stream sniping.
---
I was in a WoW streamer‚Äôs (Venruki) chat and when he was world pvping Asmongold, and one of Asmongold‚Äôs viewers @helzarian in chat thousands of times in a one hour period. All because I like Horde.
---
I got a beta invite, leveled to 30, haven't logged in a few weeks   
---
I played hundreds of hours of vanilla, no sense burning myself out before classic releases.
---
That was me with the Xbow of Smighting.   AV was a total slaughter fest for me.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. You're gonna miss out on a lot of fun!
---
  PvE wise, Engineering is still a good choice. If you totally ignore the PvP benefits, you'll have jumper cables, battle chickens, gear, and sapper charges for BWL.
---
Hunter/Mage/Priest/Warlock are all pretty self sustaining solo levelers.
---
That is such a ridiculous leap, do you strawman every argument you ever make, or just ones against people you hate for no reason?
---
It's always the calm, friendly guys that are ripped.
---
What the hell.
---
So that higher lvl content can be bugged. My guess is they don't want players to rush to lvl 60 in the beta and not explore anything, so they slowly increase lvl cap. This makes players explore more lower lvl content and find more bugs
---
You don't need hundreds of people to test AB though. If you want to PVP, go play retail or a Pserver.
---
Hmmm that sounds great!  I'll be a holy paladin hopefully you're alliance! haha
---
DW at 10 was rogue only
---
Hopefully the really efficient gold farming methods will not work in classic but we will see. As for inflation let's hope it is not to bad if it is it will really make casual life harder never mind the price of flasks think if the mana pots
---
Jup, same counts for Smite, killed many players hiding in a bush and getting 2-4 smites of before they knew what was attacking them.
---
We have Forsen
---
As someone in marketing however, there should have been made consideration for what is given to the streamers in comparison to standard players. 
---
Making a divide isn‚Äôt a very clever idea. In all of
---
Human history there has always been frictions when an authority has started appointing the upper class. 
---
That being said - I don‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôm just looking forward to being back in classic.
---
#It‚Äôs going to be amazing
---
But it doesn't fit one side's narrative so they will ignore that and continue blaming Soda for not bending over and taking stream sniping in the ass. 
---
The funniest thing is for every person that goes to stream snipe him, two more are willing to follow him around and kill anyone who fucks with him. He's going to be fine no matter how angry these guys get, but this sub is going to be fucking aids for like a month even after the game launches until the mods start banning people who cry about or even mention Soda. And it will be a better place for it when they do.
---
Ah, so they are all on crack. It kind of makes sense now.
---
that was pretty cool
---
For most classes finding a group takes some time. And while there are dungeons that can be completed in an hour, there's also tons of dungeons that take longer than that.  
---
The best chances to get into a group immediately after logging in, certainly exist for a tank.  
---
Since you will never be able to do highend-raid-content with that time-investment I'd recommend picking druid. It's good enough to tank 5 mans but comes with the advantage with being easier to level and more flexible. You could also heal which means your chances to find a group are even higher.
---
I have a vivid memory of sitting in Ironforge at the exact  moment I learned Steve Irwin died. I spammed trade chat and no one believed me.
---
I hope that if we get TBC, a lot of players will raise to remove the reinforcements from patch 2.3
---
Well the game should be based on exploit bug !
---
Link doesn't work
---
What methods wont work and why
---
He was also an absolute raiding killer for me personally. We downed him after 2 months of progress. We raided 3 or 4 times a week for 4 hours each, so I'd put our guild back in those days at somewhat hardcore but...we had quite a few players who just made too many mistakes too often.
---
Progressing on a boss like Ragnaros HC in 25 man, 3 times a week (clearing the rest of the raid obviously took some time) was fun but it burned me out (no pun intended). Going through the first three phases without anyone fucking up took ages and then when you got into phase 4, an entire new bossfight started and you had to learn the mechanics immediately.
---
Being the "firefighter" in the last phase was also one of the most 	unappreciative things I ever did in WoW. If you cleaned out the fire perfectly, nobody cared. Then someone would fuck it up in the geyser and you go again. Next try, some firepatch spawns in a shitty spot and you will have to do your best to contain it as well as it is still possible and then you wipe and everyone shits on you because "hurrdurr fire guys fucked it up".
---
Killing that boss was the greatest thing I've done in WoW but it ended my raiding "career" (for lack of a better word). I was just done, that was the first time it took me so long to down a boss with a guild and I could not imagine doing this all over again for the next raid, possibly. So I quit raiding and never came back.
---
The pets are annoying and have a bad interface.  The soul shard system sucks.  You are permanently a summoning your group mates because they see lock and decide to get lazy about traveling.  Warlocks worst PvP matchups are warriors and rogues - the 2 most popular classes in the game.  The damage is slow build up which makes them less exciting to play than burst classes.  
---
Warlocks have cool class fantasy and design.  But mostly, mages are better in almost all aspects.
---
A lot to say here but will cliffsnotes to make this useful:
---
-Tier 1 holy talents scale with gear, so they suck while leveling but get way better at 60/raid gear. 
---
-for pve, anticipation will way outscale toughness for damage mitigation, and this is independent of gear. (Tier 2 vs 3 on prot tree)
---
-those 3 points in isoc are almost for sure wasted; on a single mob/leveling you will almost never full cycle soc-&gt;sor on repeat, ao this is basically just for bosses in dungeons. Its too fringe. 
---
-reckoning, imo, is the reason to go deep prot. But to each his own!
---
Hope that helps and good luck
---
 !remindMe 78 days
---
I'd like to submit shamans for the last 3 points. And yes I know they don't do gold farming that good but there are almost no single mob you can't kill as a shaman and smart use of totems and environment gives you the ability to kill small packs of elites (problem for them is speed not ability) running and anking gives the ability to skip things you don't want to kill
---
I've played some of the betas of wow expansion before and it was the most fun I ever had. Progress does not matter so you tend to explore, test and try more things.
---
When the streamer is playing a stealth class there are plenty of ways to tell. This isn't pubg.
---
Gonna be playing Wow classic as a bit of a recreation of the fun i had with my first higher lvl characters. (Which was hunters)
---
And i considered engineering to be a fun profession for the hunter in PvP (especially AV)
---
So seeing this video basically telling me my reasoning is good is very satifying! ;)
---
Looking forward to the deadzone, and usin' grenades and trinkets to help me out.
---
Looking forward to resisting rouge and paladin stuns. (Orc Hunter)
---
Looking forward to  doing ALL the quests.
---
Even looking forward to farming dungeons for Best in slot gear.
---
I don't expect me to be raiding, but pvping with best in slot gear pre-raid gear, yes thank you very much!
---
Dude, switch to English keyboard please.
---
&gt;  The soul shard system sucks since they despawn on logout.
---
Uh, nope.
---
Well, it's great if you get big.
---
Where are they?
---
Hold my beer
---
Fuck those cancer streamers
---
They dropped some pretty good loot. Like a +41 frost damage helmet blue.
---
The games are still going to be 15-30mins long.
---
The current meta for 1.12 AV is for both teams to pass each other, with horde grabbing around 3k bonus honor and accepting the inevitable loss. 
---
It only turns into a several hour game if someone deliberately turtles, at which point no one gets any honor since HKs decay into 0 honor very fast.
---
God I still resent myself for getting GM during my high school days...I was playing around 20 hours a day for the last couple of ranks to get GM.  My social life suffered so much haha.  It was cool when my best friend and I got GM on the same week but still.
---
huh, would have assumed this sub would prefer the original version
---
Another fantastic vid from Madseason.
---
Not according to this sub apparently, who feel so bullied
---
Mate did you see him do 20 push ups on stream? Watch the fuck out
---
DW @ 10? You sneaky backstabber ;) Everyone had to wait for it until 20 for it minus rogues.
---
So does he need to do specifically for you to be ok with him having beta access?
---
‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt work lol why do you need to go to work stop crying‚Äù
---
I dont think anyone with half a functioning brain would imagine classic wow in 2019 being the same as vanilla in 2004
---
I‚Äôm shocked at how different the feel is from this trailer to retail wow... retail wow seems to have lost so much of what the game was originally intended to be. 
---
Vanilla WoW (which I never played) seems to be D&amp;D come to life... an adventurer placed in a dangerous and unexplored world. What will happen??
---
Retail WoW is some kind of shitty super saiyan 100% narrated story where you‚Äôre already pre destined to win and feel good about yourself.
---
Looking sick! Any chance getting a mage?
---
If you semi popular the pay I'd around 15k
---
A month...
---
Fuck off
---
Maybe, we won't really know until it's released. Hence going in blind.
---
Streaming is certainly not something I could do, but my snark is mostly sarcastic. I actually enjoy watching a few of them. As far as your point about the pay not being that great, you're dead wrong. There are quite a few WoW streamers that are easily making six figures a year for sitting in their house being a "no-lifer".
---
Who needs mana anyway.
---
Do it. I'm rolling ret pally because it's my favourite spec and I don't really care whether I get invited to raids or not
---
One of the only ones that is just relaxed, down to earth and honest.
---
But the other streamers won't have a problem with having a central blacklist. It's beneficial to all of them. If you look at what numbers Asmongold pulls on average... I mean, I don't know the server cap for classic, but it could be possible that one server is just 80% streamer followers.
---
Of course he says that. It's a joke dude. He makes light of the fact people give them free shit all the time. It's a schtick to say no give it to me I need it more because I'm the streamer. It's not him demanding special treatment. It gets a reaction. It's entertaining. I'm not saying it's God tier comedy but it's meant to be funny. By just embracing it he creates more entertainment and gives chat something to react to which makes it more entertaining.
---
This is the best answer. What's wrong with people that don't want the content the be tested ? If you don't want to be "spoiled" just don't look at streamers.
---
I don't disagree with you, but that also means we got a lot of people in this sub with less than half-functioning brains.
---
I would argue its worth playing so you can test out which race/class/spec combo you enjoy. Would save you time from making new characters come release
---
Again he was talking about world pvp not stream sniping. He means that if someone sees him they will try and pvp him because he's a streamer and he has to suffer that. He isn't talking about stream snipers taking him out of stealth because they know exactly where he is or standing right on top of his ghost because they know where he's trying to res. If you can't see the difference then you are an idiot.
---
If you‚Äôve never heard of Garmarna should give them a shot. The Vederg√§llningen CD is perfect for WoW, especially PVP.
---
Fun fact: the song Herr Mannelig, off their Guds Spelem√§n CD, is based on an ancient Swedish folk song about a female Troll who falls in love with a knight.
---
Hi, /u/Drife98
---
Who said bloodfang never got anyone laid
---
I like this guy
---
This level of ugly is a timeless classic.
---
Auto spam filter? You have to have a minimum karma or you basically get shadowbanned here
---
It's actually pretty easy when they are literally following his ghost around while he's dead.
---
How did you get free playtime?
---
Got either 20k or 40k karma, not sure but I think that should be enough
---
Bean, 2nd place Blizzcon, super chill, sometimes watches Hell‚Äôs kitchen. 10/10
---
could you specify the requirements more? 
---
does "constantly talking/commenting on every little thing" apply even to his thought processes and explanation about whats happening ingame or do you mean constant annoying chat interactions and constant greeting viewers and random shite unrelated to the game ? 
---
also do you want a hardcore experienced vanilla player/pvper or a casual exploring the world without much knowledge instead?
---
or do you literally want to watch the gameplay with ingame sounds but without any commentary?
---
Buckle up, you are in for a real gud (corpse) run
---
Yeah I misread,  I see a lot of people say it's just like meth so it went straight to my head.
---
Bone Apple Tea
---
Yikes from me dawg
---
not that rich lmao he's still living with his parents
---
The very reason I avoid retail is this very reason. It's just power leveling and doing the same damn thing over and over again in endgame. Classic WoW gives the chance for the experience of the leveling to be the experience.
---
The reworked version of AV is definitely missing some of the magic of the original but even back in the day I thought the new version was an improvement overall. It‚Äôs an imperfect product but I think I‚Äôll be glad to see the games finish
---
They should consider adding the loot that dropped from the AV bosses in again.
---
But they jusf announced it. Its a hugs dissapointment in my opinion. The biggest letdown of classic so far.
---
You might be on to something. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre a group of like minded gamers playing together to achieve a goal. The game could use a system like this. We could call them ‚Äúguilds‚Äù and the streamer who‚Äôs allocating resources to achieve this goal could be called the ‚Äúguild master‚Äù. 
---
This might work you crazy sonovuh-bitch!
---
No, they wouldn't, because there used to be so many and so strong NPCs that you couldn't just zerg past them. They'd hit you, daze you, dismount you and fucking murder you. And that's without any opposing faction players helping the defense.
---
God forbid your zerg train tries to run past the NPCs and an enemy mage blinks to the middle and frostnovas your zerg.
---
thanks man, thats sweet
---
Weeb shit ----&gt; Outta here
---

---
Nickname for shapeshifting into a mustang
---
No your effort in those two hours  could be just to capture one single graveyard in those two hours or even to have defended a tower. It was truly an epic battle and that made it so much fun!
---
It doesnt fit with todays instant gratification culture that wants high results and high rewards for every 15 minutes of play but I thought Classic wasnt for them.
---
Europe, technically GMT+2, but Daylight saving time seems to have put us at GMT+3 atm (aka Moscow time according to google).  
---
I.e. at the time of writing this message it is 12:13 PM for me.
---
Imagine a feather with arms doing push ups.
---
Retail is very different to classic, the content was replaced entirely with Cataclysm. There are also mechanical changes, such as you don't pick a spec at level 10.
---
However, you don't need to know much. Look for a guild, there will be huge levelling guilds released at launch. There will also be the opportunity to join questing groups.
---
For going from rank 12 to 14, you'd need to be putting in 60+ hours per week.
---
I bet you are DEAD chuffed with yoursELF
---
How is it making anyone handicap when you can choose not to be part of the server? Do you want to try and read what I wrote again? This is a server separate from the general preceived server.
---
Sounds like you have a classic case of suck.
---
Um you don't have to be a part of the server?
---
Yes if you forget about the raid PTRs they‚Äôve done for the past 12 years...
---
Depends on how successful classic is.
---
&gt; But shouldn‚Äôt it be also in the interest of the streamer then to hide the identity of characters and server then
---
You severely underestimate streamsnipers.  Hiding it for longer than one stream is impossible.
---
The worst chat channel in wow history. Pure Timmy's saying the same thing over and over.
---
I don't understand these responses. What are you trying to prove? How is a separate server from the general ones going to bother you? I'm not saying all servers should be like this, I'm talking about a special type of casual server one that you can CHOOSE not to be a part of. So explain to me how that is a problem to you.
---
&gt;My ideal Classic WoW experience is to stream Classic WoW and everyone just plays on the server as if no one's streaming. Yeah, see that's not happening. Ignore the streamers, please. Like, I don't want any- I'd love to not receive any streamer benefits but also all the downsides of being a streamer - I don't want to receive those either. I'd rather it all just be gone. I wanna be a completely normal player.
---
Bet this won't get removed by the mods eh
---
So I'll try to go over the talent choices and what is the reason behind them. First of this is a pvp spec that focuses on damage and healing in pvp. Whit this spec your healing in pve will be ok as long as you are in a mele group. Let's start in the elemental tree. First of your main problem as a elemental is mana get all mana saving talents. If you want you can move 3 points from concussion to elemental warding the damage increase is not mandatory and this will make you a bit sturdier. Moving to next tier here call of thunder is mandatory. I personally don't take elemental focus sins I don't cast that many spells putting the extra talentpoint in reverberations. Next tier. Eye of the storm is essential. You will do alot of healing in pvp and this will help. Next tier now we are getting into the good stuff. Extra casting range will make fighting casters easier and you can stay at healing distance of your frontline and still cast lightning on their backline without being in range for return damage. Elemental fury might be one of the best talents in the game. Next tier. Another possible best talent in the game. This is what makes you shine as a pvp burster. Lets go to resto tree. First of all sins you are going for a pvp spec there are some serious sacrifices in your healing capacity. First of whit out shorter casting speed you will most likely not be tank healing. I still suggest taking mana cost reduction this is one of the best talents in the tree. Second tier ancestral healing is good for you because you will try to stack critt anyway and the extra armor may save your life. Reduced mana cost again as stated earlier always go for them. Next tier hitt and extra range on totems. Hitt is almost self explanatory. The extra range on totems is a bandage on one of your big weakness you have to stay in range of your totems or recast them this helps. Lastly nature's swiftness this is what makes you be able to hitt whit 3 spells simultaneously cast chainlightning then NS then lightning bolt and finally frost shock. This will hitt almost att the same time due to travel times
---
This is absolute nonsense. NPCs where much harder and respawned faster, bosses where harder, there where more npcs, etc. People wherent retarded back then, they wanted to win fast and get their reward as well and back then people really did know how to play their class. It was design decisions that changed it into todays rushfest, not people.
---
In the same patch they also handed out grandmaster gear. I remember in AB premades being 41point affliction (with a felguard because of a bug) and reliably defending flags 2-3 v1. Not because I was good, but because I only needed a GCD to dish out 1k+ ticking damage from one of several dots. Even if you got me, without dispel, you were done. Truly OP and I loved it.
---
If you don't play for a few weeks straight in the general server, you will end up in a server with nobody in it because everyone finished BWL, AQ and Naxx and are going to go to another server. Either way you're going to have to go to another server due to low -population. But with a casual server it will align people with more hectic schedules and have people enjoy the game time to time rather than speed leveling and endgame spurging. A server that is completely done and nobody is there anymore you can avoid, join a casual server and you can align your time better with other players.
---
Couldn't careless about streamers having beta access, won't be able to play wow when it even comes out as will be busy irl, so I don't get to play anytime soon, that is one "but you are just jealous!!!!!" Ticked off.
---
I would hate to be a streamer as seems like being a 30 year old kids show host but with your online life and personal life invaded just so you can get paid a lot, another "you are jealous!" Ticked off.
---
Streamers seem to fake so much in their content and have to endlessly jump to the "hot" content or game or else risk losing viewers which just sounds joyless.
---
Another " you are jealous!" Ticked off.
---
So going by the logic that not everyone who dislikes streamers is jealous ( because that is the logic a fanboy or child uses when someone dislikes their favourite what ever) I would say streamers damage communities of any game as they all have their own communities for one. Another issue is vanilla wow was amazing and it was around when the internet was still young, when the internet didn't have so much social media annd social media wasn't as important, now however stuff is live streamed, you might get tweets or some other bs saying " meet st the crossroads 8pm" which will spread out the player unevenly and at times will mess up people's questing, people's fun and how make certain areas lively or dead.
---
As someone who doesn't raid or give a fuck about what ever raid or instance is being mentioned over and over, then no idea about that but I assume that if people are doing the same " you are jealous that you didn't get to do this raid" logic is being used then the issue people say is real otherwise surely you just point out why they are wrong in one sentence instead of doing dumb you are jealous comments.
---
Also I only really want to roleplay again in classic/vanilla world settings but obviously you only had to be on Reddit without even viewing gaming subs to see what streamers did to GTA roleplay and how they effected it.
---
Looking forward to all the complete morons who will follow some dumb streamer to a roleplay server and just grief or act like a child.
---
In short, the world is a different place now and even server back in the day had their own communities that were servers based, now they are communities from the outside, it is obvious we will get guilds that are called like "-insert streamers name-" just for attention which will annoy, same with all the twitch jargon which plenty of people won't get or want to get.
---
Why do you care that there would be a casual server with level caps and slower raid progression? You don't have to be a part of it.
---
The reason I care so much about that is that people complete everything in the server in endgame in just 3 months and leave for another server dropping the population down to nothing. Understand now?
---
I dont believe in bide's
---
I wasn't suggesting parcec cloud, but only their core software, which is free to use on your own hardware if I'm not mistaken, even if it's not open source.
---
And there is regular wow for you to fit your needs. Also know one played for 14 hours, you just keave when you need to go and become part of the same battle or a new one the next day. The idea is your part of an ongoing epic battle instead of an instant victory for the ADD induced give me free victories and epics now crowd.
---
The GM was so great and added it with the restore to check out my old vanilla chars. I haven‚Äôt played since 2008 or so.
---
Jumper cables is not an argument for a priest :p
---
I don‚Äôt wanna play on their server. I like watching them and it‚Äôs good some people enjoy streamers but personally I just want a normal server. Obviously there won‚Äôt be a server with no streamers - lots of people stream - but I don‚Äôt want the big names like soda and Asmon running the show.
---
Good job posting a 2 year old clip that has nothing to do with stream sniping. 
---
Here's a clip where he explains what stream sniping is: https://clips.twitch.tv/TastyWrongBaconNotATK
---
Soda has absolutely nothing against pvping, camping and even encourages it.
---
No.
---
Awesome dude, finally can look for stats like hit etc. big thx!!! üòò
---
I thought people called bullshit thinking ot's not his screenshot (I saw it somewhere before)
---
The second I see a point rest on nostalgia they get a downvote. For years upon years I've seen every opinion on vanilla be brushed aside by the fucking awful 'nostalgia' argument. 
---
Oh you liked a feature? Sorry, I know you better than yourself. Yes this is merely a case of you tearfully reminiscing and the current version is way better, because I say so.
---
Play the fucking game like a normal person. Then why don't you go to retail and not play classic wow. Isn't that what retail players say? Just play the game as it is? You think you do but you don't?
---
PvE servers would be more quickly finishing endgame since there's less world pvp preventing people from getting there.
---
This
---
Not everyone is part of the give me free epics and free victory in 5 minutes crowd. If you are then retail wow is there for you. Let us people that need "help" please enjoy the original experience as intended.
---
How come? Shaman is really popular
---
How is PvE servers going to slow down progression? People would level faster and finish endgame faster with less world pvp going on. Logic my friend, get it.
---
The Heroes we need.
---
Felt like I was watching Rick &amp; Morty lmao, good vid though!
---
Tailoring as you want the robe of strat life you can craft.
---
After that drop tailoring.
---
Not sure there will be any difference between privet servers or not but there have been alot of guesses going in to making private servers possible. We simply don't know what will work or not on classic and we won't know until we get there
---
I doubt they are worried about that since they have layering.
---
Same, I loved running around there for some reason. Long time ago.
---
Where did Soda say he wants the whole server to ignore those stream snipers? He is literally just talking about creating a blacklist for him and his friends/streamerfriends.
---
Not for monetary reasons. It's not expensive to live where he lives. Dude's just lazy as fuck.
---
Its a stupid argument because even if it wouldnt last two days, maybe it would last half a day or two hours but it woukd still kast a lot longer then 1.12.
---
Whats next, nerfing dungeons too so they wont last as long? Are you going to claim it doesnt matter because they wouldnt have lasted as long anyway as they did in 2005?
---
I think this is probably why he has so many viewers.
---
&gt;As we all know, these early nerfs were the beginning of the end for AV
---
No, the original battlefield was the beginning of the end for AV. The battleground was not popular. People straight up didn't enjoy it, and didn't want to play it. PvP players in particular were furious that PvE elements were in PvP content. WSG and AB by comparison barely or never changed throughout Vanilla for the very sound reason that players liked them. Blizzard's nerfing of the PvE elements in AV were a direct response to player feedback. John Staats himself said it: [AV was not popular.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fb2bo/john_staats_ama_author_of_the_world_of_warcraft/e5ymu7a/)
---
While your guild may force you to go full resto for progression raids you dont lose much healing output with a 30/0/21 spec in the early raids. 
---
Based on pserver meta, the most efficient way to make gold as a shaman is dm east runs with a warrior/rogue. With pre bis gear and maybe a manapot here and there you can heal that as ele/resto.
---
Gearing may be hard considering that the ideal raid composition consists of up to 8 shamans and everyone in 2019 knows how strong ele/resto is in pvp. Again this is based on pserver meta.
---
My plan is to raid as full resto until i have some decent gear. At this point we will have the current content on farm and I can respec to ele/resto. Respec to full resto again for new raid content and so on.
---
Just be cognizant of the fact that it's a huge investment, since leveling a character to 60 takes about 200 hours which could be spent farming on your main. You're going to have to be playing a lot and farming a lot to make it worthwhile. I'll be doing it, on a second account, so I can farm stuff whenever I have downtime on my Shaman, but it might not be a good idea for everyone.
---
Well stream sniping is part of being pvp flagged and streaming. So he should just suffer like he says at the end. Regardless of what he was talking about or age of clip. A pvper who is all about PvP bitching about pvp is hypocritical. PvE servers are there for you.
---
Won‚Äôt be playing Druid but this is a brilliant post, thanks for sharing
---
&gt;Blizzard claims they will not have any part of this ban especially because streaming is not compulsory. Because Sodapoppin decides to stream while playing, he has made the choice to allow people to know his location.
---
At least someone doesnt bow to those riddiculous streamers believes. Sodapoppin is someone who streams for whole day shitty games and then plays in his "free time" Wow on Private servers... privatly, so i dont undstand how he is has such weird opinion. For me Streamers are insta turn off when they cry about stream sniping and believe that streamers should get some special benefits.
---
You dont want know the stuff you dont need to know yet. Just chill, start playing, and when you are stuck look it up. 
---
The guys with the plans are dreamers, planning 6 months to a year ahead. They do this because the planning is fun, its setting goals to reach. This MMO is all about the long run and not the quick progression. Its the dreaming of reaching goals why people stick to this game. 
---
Just take it slow enjoy, if you see a guy playing the same class and you inspect them to see there awesome weapons and think.. damn I want that aswell. You search or ask how to get it and boom, there is your goal.
---
There is zero need to feel intimidated just dont get in over your head by joining this speedrunner mentallity.
---
You determine how fast or slow you go in a PvE server, we don't need your dumb "look what I saw on beta" ideas bub.
---
Play retail.
---
If you don't wanna commit suicide, I suggest enhancement for leveling.
---
He probably makes more in a month than you do all year. If you are popular streaming is stupidly profitable.
---
Amen to this. Don't get any of those ezmode quest map tracker add-ons either... I can't imagine getting classic wow finally and then slapping "retail" QoL features back onto it.
---
Thank you for this awesome site!
---
 Just play the damn game when it's released stop giving a shit about some online scroungers üôÇ
---
I hate all Streamers with a Passion, even though I NEVER watched anyone Stream WoW outside of watching Highlights on Reddit. 
---
But since I'm from EU I can mostly ignore them, but I'm really pissed that I have to play on the same BetaServer as them. Seeing these retards always makes me angry.
---
There are several good combinations as a priest.
---
Tailoring + enchanting is a classic combination. Drop tailoring after crafting truefaith vestments. Level herbalism (for gold) or engineering.
---
Skinning + mining, drop skinning at 60. Level tailoring - craft truefaith - drop tailoring - level engineering, concider dropping mining for herbalism
---
Herbalism + skinning. Drop skinning at 60, level tailoring - craft truefaith - drop tailoring level alchemy
---
Yea you can save bank doing that. He could help with groceries and shit but really it's easy living
---
You'll be fine. Ignore the biggest ones like you say. Others will only have the effect on a server of a big or small guild. Or heck, be a positive addition, organising events like the tournament Tips made.
---
My best friends from vanilla were British! Good Times.
---
Well, i guess i can't thank you enough to your work. Gratz man, appreciate !
---
You sinply do not use group buffs if you only buff yourself, and 3600 mana and you are oom the gear must suck hard üòÇ
---
... Loved slowing down the efforts of the alliance...
---
Thats the right thing. Good aoe pulls require practise and some gear.
---
Disgusting.
---
The skeleton summoning offhand books are [Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17067) from Ony and [Book of the Dead](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13353#comments), from live Strat.
---
How come the class spells database doesnt have cooldowns?
---
I played a priest and went for Tailoring and Herbing. Tailoring for the Chest and herbing for obvious reasons, because i did not went for a framing alt
---
Its really a double edged sword. They'll have an army of followers willing to basically farm for them for 5 seconds of recognition. They'll also have lots of stream snipers griefing and camping them if they play on a pvp server, which is probably almost a given considering every large server ever was pvp servers. 
---
If you want the best economy and the most players thats where you go.
---
Dafuq is?
---
It actually depends. In premades the calculated burst of 31/0/20 is preferable to NS, especially early on where you dont have much crit and sp. But personally i find 30/0/21 much more fun and consider it better for all the other pvp content (pugs, duels, world pvp).
---
im pretty sure retail u wont have to rebuff all the time with some classes. it may suit you better
---
Taken 2 seconds before Aragoth Life Taps his away into death again.
---
Stats for enhancement mains? I know crit is important, but its mainly a strength/AP spec, but apparently we also need X amount of int and spellpower to drop totems and shocks? 
---
Can I just need on everything :D?
---
Quality!!
---
Lol there's a big difference between running a guild and using an army of basically chinese bot farmers to boost yourself. 
---
There's a big difference in attitude when it comes to the 2 approaches.
---
Depends on the balance of players. Do you feel classic will have a bigger player base vs retail or vice versa?   Because even if Classic rocks, changing retail that many more players like is bad for the good ol pocketbook. 
---
I hate retail myself
---
That is not the point.

It does not make sense to leave the cemetery with any value lower than 100%.

1. Big post about something a streamer said.
---
2. Multiple personal opinion posts about same topic.

3. "Who cares about streamers" post.

4. This subreddit is toxic.

5. Streamer meme posts.
---
6. meme posts about streamer posts &lt;-- WE ARE HERE

7. Back to normal

8. New big post about something a streamer said.

i havent seen this meme in about 10 years
---
why are you trying to bring this back
---
Best sub rogue spec at 40? For leveling. Not going combat, have too much fun ganking w/one shot Ambush!
---
It's basically a standard PvP spec but you can heal in raids with it as long as your raid is okay with you being suboptimal, aka while MC/Ony/BWL is on farm. It helps save on respec costs, but if your raid is struggling or pushing progression you may be expected to swap to the standard 0/5/46 resto build.
---
Or he does it for the exposure and the clicks
---
blizzard is a trash tier developer at this point, having faith in them putting out anything even remotely decent is laughable
---
Fixed! Thanks for your input.
---
hes wearing blues in the farming clips
---
Play rogue, warrior or hunter.
---
If those don't work, retail.
---
Asmon gets around 40k a month from SUBS. That is not donations. With donations it ranges from 50k to 100k a month. ~
---
you can oull warmasters/marshals out of the room and clear them 1 by 1 before killing boss.  they can still respawn though especially if people loot their corpses
---
I got to General, rank 12 in vanilla. I had to play for atleast 16 hours, 7 days a week. Going for 14 pretty much required account sharing and playing politics to wait your turn. And you can't stop, or you lose rating and drop. So you have to continue grinding for weeks to maintan your rating, just waiting for your turn.
---
&gt; The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

See I‚Äôm actually pretty sure the dungeons DID get stealth needed sometime between 1.3 and 1.12.  The elite damage is really low for trash in 1.12 and all blizz has done is check that it‚Äôs the correct 1.12 values vs their reference client.   However since they‚Äôve said that they don‚Äôt have the data for before 1.12 it‚Äôs perfectly possible (and fits with how people like me and many others remember the game back then) that dungeon mob damage was a lot higher pre 1.12.  Unfortunately I doubt we‚Äôll ever be able to prove it.
---
He's living with his Mum to take care of her AFAIK.

HAHAHA
---
They should leave 60 out of beta.
---
i dont think there is a problem with streamers
---
however those people who pay a monthly subscription to their channels are clearly mentally ill
---
Nervemind.  
---
You're probably right.
---
Alledgedly he is rich enough for this to be true (his brother&amp;lawyer? is the source), so i think it is a streamer-brain malfunction
---
yep
---
I leveled in vanilla as a caster druid *before they implemented moonkin form.* Innervate was top of the talent tree. It was...slow.
---
Any recommendations in that department? I‚Äôve always been a FPS gamer so most of my mice just have the two side buttons like the Zowie FK1 or steelseries rival. I know Razer has a few mice with more mouse buttons but seems like everyone says they shit the bed after half a year so I‚Äôm hesitant to buy one.
---
Doesn't need to be fixed. We have classic.
---
If WoW would be a smaller MMO, Retail would be dead by now. The slow death of retail is so long because it started with 10+ million players. Now, it's around 1 million.
---
Still, 1 million is good for an MMO today.
---
Retail BIG problems will start when Classic hits. In 3-4 months after release, a lot of retail players will change to Classic in time, after swapping between Classic and BfA, and realizing WHY Classic is much, much superior as an MMO.
---
By end's year, Retail will be a ghost town, dropping under 500k active players (I can't say subs, since it will be common with Classic).
---
nice story :)
---
Works great! Glad I could help.

I love their lore but can't stand their animations. My first character in 2005 was a dwarf paladin, but I rerolled around level 20 to a nightelf hunter. Still remember how fed up I was with that 2H hammer animation on my dwarf...
---
Why is this so funny
---
Start here: http://www.vanilla-info.com/
---
No you play retail and stop being emotional because calling me dumb just tells me you're agitated right now. It's not about how I play it it's how the server plays itself out. A PvE server will progress fast with no pvp going on between. An retail is more suited for speed levelers and quick raiding. I've seen these people all the time you know the ones that wait for a summon to the raid? They're the ones that got the LFR off the ground, that was made for you who want to do quick raiding gouging on gear, and then doing the same thing again.
---
Plan on hitting 60 farming pre raid bis.
---
This is why he is rich
---
Listened to both of them now. I kinda like this one better
---
My only problem is the amount of juicy classic content being put out this far from release.
---
But I blame Blizzard for that.
---

7 hour queues when they remove layering - world boss kills - harassing- etc
---
Yessss
---
Yearh I am not sure both are good. I was really just making  'classic' jokeüòÄ

They'll go to 60 for sure but it'll stay at phase 1.

---
All hail the ooga gang
---
Why should I be rolling on a pvp server instead of a pve server? All the private servers are pvp so that seems to be everyone‚Äôs default choice. Why though? In my experience the ganking is just out of control and there‚Äôs more negatives than positives. Dueling is probably more fun than world pvp anyway tbh...
---
But sharing a blacklist with streamers on the other faction would be collusion which is against the TOS and is probably a bannable offense.
---
As petty as this sounds, it can also be true. If you're on a server with asmongold and soda there are going to be THOUSANDS more people swarming that event, you have no fucking chance. Also bear in mind these people do this for a job so with people like swifty grinding 18 hour days in pvp, you can just give up on getting high warlord.
---
Just gonna say LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
People Zerg the modern AV because they want to farm honor and for that you have to end the game fast to be efficient. In the old AV players did things like level up, farm rep, farm gold and ‚Äòw‚Äôpvp. You didn‚Äôt get that much from winning in terms of rewards.
---
Sure, no problem! ; ) I saw the other comments now so I understand what you were referring to.
---
Whats the ultimate leveling-guide for alliance?
---
Don't work. Site down? Error page with ria.web-hebergement.net
---
No it wont be "fixed" caus it targets a other demographic. Its fine that there are 2 diffrent versions for different players enjoy. This way the get money from both demographics.
---
Thanks!!
---
Exactly, I'm not saying I'm for Soda's idea. But if people are obviously sniping, for example if he gets killed so moves to another zone, they appear and kill him again, then they are potentially making the content worse and he will lose viewers.
---
I used to work at a place where I booked in appliance repairs. When making appointments we would say, if you're not in when the engineer comes, there is a fee to pay. But still people would go out and miss the engineer and get pissed off when we charged them.
---
Long story short, if they do implement this black list, and people still stream snipe knowing that this exists, then they deserve the consequences. As long as it's for extreme cases, not just getting ganked or camped.
---
So you‚Äôre willing to pay triple the price of a subscription on twitch to play WoW, but have the audacity to trash talk someone who is doing the exact same thing as you; supporting entertaining content they like? 
---
/facepalm
---
They won't change BFA. They are basically two different games, you change BFA to be more like vanilla you run the risk of losing the people who like BFA.
---
I disagree with you. There is no need for that both classic and bfa has its cons and pros and if you take off your nostalgia goggles you will realize that classic isnt that good like you made it
---
nagas should be shot on sight. no debate on that.
---
Aahhhh yes! I remember summoning it when I had a 60 twink boomkin! Brings back the memories
---
Inflation makes mount easier to get for late starters and it lowers the cost of wiping. None of these effects really hurt the game in my opinion.

Having fun
---
Just remember that 5 man dungeons can sometimes go longer than an hour. Also, Hunter is good for solo playing.
---
He's more machine than human now
---
Thanks very much
---
Haha no. I guess you never played a classic emulator server then but let me explain. 
---
In current retail WoW you can rush your 40 man raid to a quick 5 minute win even if 10 to 15 people on the other side are defening. Only if those defenders would be well organised and skilled, can they actually crush your assault and then the battleground may take 30 to 60 minutes to complete. 
---
In AV 1.5 you would just need 2 or 3 organised people to crush the other teams raid. And because of how strong the NPC's are and how fast they respawn you will not finish it within 30 minutes after because you well land into the fabled bottleneck tug of war that will last hours or days. 
---
Now in theory it's possible that you get 2 x 40 people where there are no 3 people that want to turn AV into a slugfest, but believe me you won't see it happen very often.
---
an elemental shaman with the same buffs will be able to burst way more than this. with berserking, you could probably deal 6500 damage instantly on a target if you crit with your lightning bolt, chain lightning and shock spell, which would land at the same if within shock range.    
---
EASILY obtainable damage with blue/epic gear and an on use trinket.
---
It should be.
---
The only place I voted for Trump.
---
&gt; Any specific functions/changes that you guys want to see on the page?  
---
Develop an addon that collects data in game from thousands of users. No site will compete with Wowhead if they're the only ones doing this. Their accuracy will be crowdsourced by thousands and you will never keep up with them.
---
Oh, right, I see. I'm sorry, that definitely wasn't my intention. I want to play classic as much as a lot of you do, I guess I didn't respect the fact you've all fought for this really hard for the past few years so it's a sore topic, but that's on me for not being clear enough.
---
It's just that op only said that level scaling was bad because it's too accessible and you wouldn't get to be one shot by a mob much higher level than you, neither of which really seemed like positive gameplay elements, more just anecdotal memories. I honestly didn't intend to dismiss the point, I just didn't really see the reasoning there.
---
 He tried to trap with serpent sting on (who ticked right after the resist)  and complained about resist. Nice level.
---
Everything you said, you can find in the current game

Imagine unironically hating streamers
---
BFA was never going to be as popular as any other expansion or as well received or as insert arbitrary subjective measurement standard. Human brain does not work that way. The human brain is designed to get a tolerance to things it enjoys and not enjoy them as much in the future. There's nothing blizzard can do about this.
---
Did you just get done studying for a spelling bee?
---
Both are right, I'm British so I defaulted to my form and forgot that yours exists
---
Its just a bunch for kids that have nothing better to do other than screeching about streamer privilidge
---
26th for US (3PM in CA and 6PM in NY, lucky them..)  Also 26th for the UK but not untill 11PM, what i was saying is that i dont understand why they didnt just release it say 9AM CA time, that way at least two regions would benefit more from playing it on the 26th.
---
Why is it a bad thing that another player is getting high warlord fairly and you aren‚Äôt?
---
You'll just have 30 teammates yelling at you, because you also slow down honor gain for the horde when you slow down the alliance.
---
if u make 4 friends sure
---
No it was the one where you could put yourself / your group in a list for a dungeon and people could invite you but you'd still need at least two people to go to the dungeon to summon. You could do it anywhere unlike the older summoning stone version where you had to be at the stone
---
The Beta-Server isn't a NA Server...
---
yIkes
---
Restroooooomoooooooooo
---
I mean would they get a priority for the actual game once its out, if streamers will play together then i dont see them being in a queue for the same amount of time as a regular player.
---
no
---
No ofcourse not, these idiots flaming are literally tunnel visioning what they see on twitch and youtube its just a bunch of loud envious retards
---
Anyone on a low pop layer? if so inv me please..
---
&gt;I also think it's absurd that a man or woman, with a job such as yourself should take so long to complete dungeons such as BRD and Sunken Temple. Let's please just implement the current retail versions of these dungeons into classic wow.
---
Just discounted your entire post and opinion on classic.
---
I'm sorta interested in giving Hunter a try but I really don't want to use a gun or crossbow.  I know the class quest bow is a good option pretty early on but how much damage will I be missing out on later if I'm too stubborn to use a crossbow/gun?
---
Niemals.
---
I am not sure either
---
No
---
My post and opinion on classic is exactly and perfectly right. What else don't you agree with?
---
I don't really think that's the reason. His mother is in her late 60s and have health problems, so he stay with her to help her.
---
this kind of stupid is a nice change from all the streamer-hate kind of stupid
---
Hello, i have some plans for datamining once classic releases. Hm i think many can "Compete" with a site that has 5-10 sec load times and overwhelmed by ads/spam. My goal is to provide a site that provides the desired information to the users without unnecessary bullshit.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Tldr: recreate classic in a way such core experiences are the same, else players might not feel it's the same.
---
Tho whole post is without purpose, and an impressive feat of saying nothing with many words.
---
Do you work for Cisco? Their course books are similar. Fluff without substance.
---
&gt; okay with you being suboptimal, aka while MC/Ony/BWL is on farm. It helps save on respec costs, but if your raid is struggling or pushing progression you may be expected to swap to the standard 0/5/46 resto build.
---
normally if you showed up to bwl without manatide you were booted lol
---
This and Athene
---
Play BFA if you do not have the time to play classic.
---
Zero point in changing anything to make it more time friendly - I can't wait to log in and only be able to do 1 dungeon.
---
Once I get what I'm after, I'll appreciate it more unlike any item since Wotlk.
---
‚ÄûI didn‚Äôt get Beta because of .. those streamers!‚Äú I mean, right?
---
Using big words doesn't make your gibberish more relevant.
---
Lots of people are stuck in the past and streamers didn't exist in 2004. Anything that differs from the experience people had back then will be met with hostility, it's only natural to fear change.
---
Okay dude
---
This has got to be a troll lol, disregard people.
---
The hardest I've laughed in weeks. 
---
The WoW fanbase vs. a verbose post from someone with an extensive lexicon: it would take a while to imagine two things more disparate.
---
Even if they wanted to it would have to be done in very small increments over the course of many many years. Suddenly changing design philosophy of the game would drive away a lot of their existing customers and wouldn't necessarily bring back the old ones so it would be a huge gamble.
---
Maybe read until the end? Or do you really not get it?
---
This. I‚Äôm glad i‚Äôm not the only one who remembers this just being a minor issue a few weeks before the TBC launch.
---
This is not the smartest thing to post on this sub.. well, unless you're farming downvotes.
---
So true. People need to shut up and stop complaining about streamers. Omg asmongold got 200 gold from a fan to buy his mount. I'ma cry and say it ruined my classic experience
---
2005 graphics aren't in classic... g1
---
Die MF Die with Dope is quite dope.
---
Probably hemo with really slow mh sword and keeping the dagger in your bag so you can easily swap them once you've ambushed/backstabbed.
---
However,having leveled like this i strongly suggest just going combat swords.
---
I can tell you that Classic is a DIFFERENT game than retail. What you experience in retail, from 1-20 worth nothing for Classic. I bet that you haven't died once, right?
---
Well, expect to die A LOT in Classic.
---
I have only some advices for you. First, arm yourself with A LOT of PATIENCE for Classic. It is the best quality that a Classic player needs. Secondly, before you create your character, be SURE that this is the class you want to play. Third, once you login, do you best to make or join parties, as much as possible, to forge relationships and friendships, that will help later for joining a guild. Fourth, whenever in trouble (quests, elite quests, hard mobs, ganking, etc) ASK people for help or directions...but before you do, try to inform yourself from the thousands of sources available on the Internet, because most of the time, it takes less time if you spend 5 minutes on the web, instead 5 minutes being laughed at, getting troll answers, Chuck Norris jokes...before someone is actually willing to help.
---
The social aspect in Classic is the pillar of your gaming experience. Do no try to downplay it. It will bite you in the ass every single day. Make friends, be a nice person, join a guild.
---
EVERYTHING worthy in Classic is long term. Many people will be lvl 60 before you are 40. Many others will be much, much richer than you. But, it doesn't matter, because reaching lvl 60 or having plenty of gold are SECONDARY goals in Classic. The primary goal is having FUN...and you will have it, as long as you will be patient and have friends.
---
The natural dynamic and chemistry of Classic will get you. You are not playing a game, you are a cog in a world that will become your second home. 
---
I think that Vanilla, as it was, it was an accident. I cannot put my finger on WHAT exactly made Vanilla the masterpiece of MMOs. And I don't think anyone can, not even those who made Vanilla.
---
All I know is that if you have patience, and in-game friends, Classic will be the BEST gaming experience you will EVER live. There isn't even a second best. Or a third.
---
I think it's a decent joke that quite a few people took too serious.
---
Will there be another beta invite round?
---
Spergs. 
---
The streamers may be fine on their own. 
---
Ideally if a streamer played on a server where no one watched or knew who said streamer were, I imagine it'd be perfect for all parties involved. 
---
The streamers can't control their spergs/fanboys who will flock to them. This can - and probably will - ruin server balance and potentially kill a server when the streamer eventually leaves the server. 
---
If you want a good analogy - watch Forsen play any BR. I recommend the old PUBG ones, kinda hilarious. Now imagine this attention seeking crowd either protecting the streamer, or going after him. They don't care about the game, just the streamer.
---
What they meant to say was 
---
&gt;I wish I were in beta, but I‚Äôm not so I‚Äôm gonna say this to make myself feel better.
---
Literally just go on twitch under wow section, look at the streams from 50-2k viewers, leave if you don't like them, stay if you do. It takes almost no time to find streamers that YOU like.
---
Well mostly because cooldows are not a static value rather dynamic. But i will take a look at it and see what i can do.
---
Paragraphs.
---
There is no sharding in classic, just layering in starter zones. Also I don't think we are simply getting the aesthetic of vanilla here because we are dealing with the same loot tables, drop rates, mechanics, spells, no dungeon/raid finder, etc etc. It's literally vanilla but with older and more experienced players plus more guides. Yes mentality is different but that's one factor out of a hundred others that Blizzard has control over and is not changing.
---
And people are arguing they remember the exact damage values of how hard certain mobs hit for when they cant even remember if they killed a world boss in tbc or wotlk lol
---
Is it worth doing the Level 10 human rogue quest exp/time wise?
---
I would consider a paladin. As a DPS-only class, you'll spend that hour looking for a group.
---
NO!
---
People sub to see the notification on the stream. It makes them feel important.
---
Streamers love to contradict themselves. I've seen Asmon say he loved WotLK and then in another video he says he hated it and it was the worst expansion.
---
Your humor is unfortunately too high brow for the folks who frequent /r/classicwow. These are players driven from the game by intelligence-based skill-based challenge added in the Burning Crusade. You need to wear your opinion on your sleeve - if you want old AV, and by the way I agree with you- you need to say it.
---
Sure that's fine, but if you don't see the reasoning them just say it. You're just assuming it's nostalgia because you don't understand - yes something I had to deal with on /r/WoW copiously when people were pretending WoD wasn't shit.
---
When you were exploring as a n00b occasionally you would stumble into a hard ore area and you would be one shot. It would remind you that you are weak, and you'd think 'one day I'm going to go back and own that'. It gave you something to anticipate, provided a marker of progression and provided a sense of achievement.
---
Who cares its not like only 3 druids will exist on the server. Its not that much of a difference, this talk about not playing or playting a class cuz of the amiount that its played is utterly irrelevant.
---
&gt;By the same logic you could ask why anyone would ever participate in TM vs Southshore since there weren't any BG rewards for it.
---
I mean I won't do that either, I'll do proper wpvp.
---
Idk I like that... that basically means that there is cool stuff that is not attainable by someone that is a nobody( or not able grind for 18h per day). Meanwhile the high warlord is just that, a High Warlord. someone that grinds 18h a day and everyone knows him and can watch him and get a taste of the high warlord life without grinding 18h a day.
---
I much prefer this than a filthy casual like my self has a shot at all tiles and dungeons.
---
I mean I am sure as hell going to watch people raid Naxx... never going there myself. So I am going to get a taste of Naxx... and I also get to see the players in game decked out in the capital. I think this is just going to add to the overall experience.
---
That beging said the followers (asmons followers) that is a different story
---
Why does it matter how it‚Äôs ran or the attitude of either approach if the outcome is your concern? 
---
It sounds like it has more to do with who‚Äôs doing it than what they‚Äôre doing.
---
+ forming a group + travel to the dungeon take easily 30-60m
---
93% positive votes, but you'll tell me they're bots maybe? Glad the majority of people can take a joke :')
---
You are confusing ingame activities with irl. It would be against TOS if you team up with with other faction to kill something or someone. But Blizzard can't force you to play with someone.
---
This happened on 2006. August 7. 
---
And my first screenshot is from 2006 January 16. as level 7, so I started playing a few days before that.
---
Oh please, shut it.
---
The "nerfed" AV version battles can still rage on for several hours.
---
It was never the mechanics of the BG that made the long battles possible...it was the PLAYERS munching into each other, who later wisened up to the idea, of actually going for the goals on the map, instead of doing half-day-long zergfests and hoping for "someone" to do "something". Do you believe that, because some NPCs have some more HP, the battle takes that much longer?
---
If you wanna blame someone, blame the players.
---
I have played pretty much every pserver since (and including) Nost. It is the same on all of them, premade AV groups will end the game in about 6 minutes. If both sides want a short game, 6 minutes are all it takes.
---
You are forgetting one thing: Kids today are complete snowflakes. Do you think they will have the patience for Classic? This is a major variable. 
---
Leeroys/Rambos are punished in Classic/Vanilla. Kids these days just seem to want to play smash and grab games.
---
It‚Äôs possible that Classic is the Antidote to this. It‚Äôs completely possible that Classic will completely change the paradigm for young gamers today. Holy shit, I‚Äôm baked.
---
Their unnecessary bullshit is a good weakness in their armor, but the fact still remains that they have a superior data collection tool that only gets more accurate as the day goes on. They sleep while their site improves.  
---
Each time the beta cap raises, Wowhead gets more accurate.  
---
I personally think Wowhead is a shit show, so I'd really like somebody else to do everything they do, but better.
---
Thanks :)
---
My OCD is tingeling
---
You take the things Asmon says way too seriously &amp; that‚Äôs all there is to that
---
My first toon took similar time - half a year real time, some 22 days /played. And I don't regret a single second.
---
If you want BIS, you need to take tailoring at first to craft Truefaith Vestements which will last you until BWL. Then you can drop Tailoring for Alchemy or Engineering or whatever.
---
I wish I'd kept mine. I don't know what I was thinking the day I deleted them.
---
Thank You!
---
Imagine imagining things
---
Honestly I would play here. I sometimes get competitive so would be nice to have a limit to allow me to take it easy.
---
People who don't understand that a special server doesn't mean that every single server would be level locked - joining this server would be 100% voluntary.
---
Can't have capitals after the first letter. Fake.
---
PvP doesn't have a lot of differences outside ganking.
---
However, you were out in the world a lot more often and ran into players a good amount, especially on the opposite faction.
---
Being on a PvP server, my guild would kinda roll and get payback if someone ganked and camped our person. And then they would call back up, and it would escalate into just "Stupid Arena" 
---
Or if you were raiding Molten Core, raids would fight other raids, and IIRC, you couldn't instance in while in combat. So no running into the raid zone.
---
My friend who got me into WoW  called PvE servers "Carebear Servers" because there was never any "threat" outside the world the devs created.
---
No, that's the Hunter's job.
---
There aren't that many great guns tbh, some are good but not really stronger than some bows, in fact I find it's much easier to maintain usage of bows than guns. Crossbows kinda meh, the only good one I can think of is the rank 14 one , I could be mistaken though but either the hunter epic weapon chain at 60 is solid enough to last you till AQ.
---
this is getting old
---
D2 will not be out until phase 5, which is AQ40. 
---
It's not terrible gear, but at this time it's already obsolete compared to the other items in game.
---
Pretty sure it's a joke
---
It's absurd how hard you can lay on sarcasm and still people won't catch it.
---
Indeed i did get yelled at.
---
However i understand them since they had goals (They were playing it for the marks, not for fun.)
---
No, modern wow will evolve to cater to a more modern mobile gaming demographic (lootbox + RNG , insta whatever needs to be obtained, everyone is a winner) and hopefully vanilla will stick to older RPG gameplay style.
---
Two games , if you enjoy both play both, if not play the one you like the most
---
Yeah, guns are pretty garbo unless you went engineering and had the Thorium bullets. They made an NPC able to trade you Thorium Arrowheads from bullets, but I don't remember if that was a thing in 1.12
---
I keep trying to convince myself to go ally, and I'll finally get myself hyped up for it, then I see a screenshot of Mulgore or thrall, and I'm back at square one lol
---

---
Scroll down to the alliance section, his routes are usually the most optimal but since most people will probably be using these routes it might end up counter-productive to use it ( same goes for horde routes) , so I'd suggest you take this with a grain of salt and not follow it to the letter.
---
Agree. Worst combo of roles is MT and Raid Leader. I did it back in Vanilla (I was also the Guild Master) and it was EXTREMELY stressful. It was not long before I dropped the Raid Lead.
---
Being MT is already too much.
---
Mirror?
---
Movement yes, position in relation to the world - no.
---
it was a thing
---
If someone is obviously doing it then sure. It's the potential abuse if the system when a handful of people have no checks or balance.
---
I can't stand Alliance.
---
Never will.
---
Yes indeed and it was the players that made BRD and sunken temple feel so hard and challenging. Back in the days we didn't have an idea how these dungeons worked. So why not implement modern versions of it? We are going to finish them in 20 minutes anyway!
---
2 out of 3 of your specs were just bad.
---
Unless you were a mage, and you had Frost and Fire being "Situationaly good."
---
Why? It's a fucking fantasy game. I will play a flying helicopter if I want to. It's not a dating site, so get the fuck over yourself.
---
I love these kinds of videos, will watch it later for sure :)
---
Durotar !
---
NO! GIVE THE SPIRIT TO THE PRIEST YOU STUPID CHICKEN!
---
Is the wait killing anyone else?
---
I play since the US Beta and I never missed that Jump, how is that even possible?
---
I agree with you, I personally don't care as I'm not a ganker anyway. I'm just echoing what most people are concerned about here.
---
I think you wrong. Especially if we talk about pvp section.
---
You completely missed my point. Layering is similar enough in sharding to where you will very rarely see the streamers. A streamer's layer, shard, whatever you want to call it, is going to be full most of the time with his friends and guild members. Guilds are much more massive in Vanilla and they try to put friends and guild mates together on the same layer if they can. I think layers only have something like 300 people per. You won't see them often enough to matter.
---
As for my shell of vanilla comment, obviously it's the same game mechanically. I already said that. What people keep forgetting is a huge part of what makes these old games are the community behind them. We have already seen the extremely toxic community in this subreddit alone filled with hate and vitriol for streamers like Soda and Asmon. I'm not talking about people who don't want to play with streamers, I don't want to play with them either, I mean the people in here calling Soda and Asmon human garbage, pieces of shit, and actually wanting to create guilds and wasting all of their valuable time stream sniping them and griefing them. Absolutely toxic shit. 
---
Let's not forget the other side, the twitch community as well, another toxic community where we will see constant Kappas, 4heads, triHards etc. in chat all day, every day. The game will be very different when launch comes and everyone realizes this. You can disagree if you want, but no point arguing until launch comes and we see it.
---
I don't know what the issues is, are they just jealous they got in to help promote the game?
---
Because if so.. that's fucking life.
---
I played on the EU server that &lt;Method&gt; played on, i never noticed them really.
---
I thought the human start zone was neat.
---
I like playing dwarves, but 10 levels of snowy mountains really wears you down lol.
---
I really don't understand the hate towards streamers. Just avoid their server and you never have to deal with them. There are some great people streaming like Esfand, him and his community are some of the most wholehearted people I've met on the internet. Streamers have the benefit of causes very large pvp battles and other "events" that can only occur when two large streamers and their communities collide.
---
Kinda. Your client sends your coordinates to the server, which can be abused and is the reason speed/teleport hacks exist...
---
Good luck getting any significant progress, when you'll fight 2 hours to tag a quest mob, suffer lags, have to deal with fanboys in an unfair environnement spammed with overused twitch stupid memes, just to be able to cross path with asmongoloid in sw. Oh and if you planned on getting scarab lord or any other significant milestone, forget about it because it will be like playing on a p2w private server except it will be legal and you'll never be able to compete with anything.
---
Although I don't encourage nor support ganking, it does make the world feel more alive.
---
Having to constantly be on the lookout in case the opposite faction is near plays a huge faction into how immersive WoW can be, although I do see how it can seem strange to those who have never played on a pvp server before but I guess most of us started on pvp realms back then so we sorta got used to the idea , even if there are negatives to it.
---
To be fair, there's nothing more fun than a server with a balanced faction ratio, when it's close to 50/50 it always ends up breeding the most exciting world battles and call to arms rallies ever.
---
Were not getting this version of AV fam, 1.12.1 is post nerf AV you wont see the bosses
---
Mage or Rogue?
---
Not true for all
---
Uhm, why?
---
Spotted the tier 3 sub donating everyday and sucking every streamer dick in his vicinity to get a bit of attention.
---
if anyone wants me to do Photoshop commissions hit me
---
up
---
Some specs were meant to be dabbled into as utility options, like Arcane. Arcane had some fantastic things to pick up, but it was a utility tree--not one to main. Same with several others.
---
I played on a pve server in vanilla. There was still world pvp in the form of ‚Äúraids‚Äù on Xroads or Sentinel Hill. The difference was that a rogue couldn‚Äôt ambush you when you had a couple mobs gathered up. I still knew members of the opposite faction and have always loved pvp. It seems like everyone is just going to play on a pvp server because that has been the only choice for private servers.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure a pvp server is actually worth the headache. The only benefit I can really think of is ganking people at flight masters for r14 grind.
---
which is how much? if we're talking even 100 players within the agreed blacklist group, it's not enough to deter people from ganking, if harassing streamers is a players goal the blacklist is redundant
---
I think a lot of people are doing that too. There's no way this many people actually plan to stream snipe, they are just jumping on an anti-streamer hate train for no reason. 
---
Hardly anyone will be affected by his blacklist, and anyone who is honestly deserves it, imo. I don't care if they do it, they can ruin Soda's entire stream for all I care, but they don't get to cry about the consequences of doing so when they can simply choose not to. 
---
I absolutely love the argument of "he should play on a PvE server" or "stop streaming then" when the literal equivalent is to not stream snipe and you won't get put on his list. It's like all logic and reason got thrown out the window in this sub.
---
Im obviously not saying filthy casuals should be able to get this stuff, but also when theres an individual who is paid to sit and do nothing else all day, has thousands of people he can pick from for perfect premades 24/7, it kind of squashes the competition. I completely agree with some areas of the game being borderline unaccessible, like naxx.
---
if you can't handle me at my non-streamer you don't deserve me at my streamer
---
You're part of the crew running that site? 
---
Let me take the chance then and congratulate you and anyone who's involved in this project for your **outstanding work**. I can't see myself ever using another database again, simply because of the clean layout and easy navigation. I have no doubt that anyone who values a fast and clear access to information will use your work over anyone else's. 
---
Knowing that increased traffic might put some strain on your project in the future I'd like to ask if you've already set up a patreon account. I'd be more than happy to support the team working on this on a monthly basis. You're providing an invaluable asset for many in the community and I'm sure there are many others like me out there who'd hate to see you forced to run ads at some point.
---
Seriously. This topic has been discussed for at least a week now.
---
it's going to be interesting to see how the streamer server turns out either way
---
Im not complaining that someone else is getting high warlord. Im just saying that it makes a lot of sense why someone would want to play on a different server to these people who have a lifestyle that can never be competed with.
---
Is there actual proof people were given priority queue?
---
It's funny what streaming does to a game.
---
I played in the original vanilla beta and it was cool an all but tbh no one had any idea back then and the hype around it certaintly wasn't as big like today.
---
This time around, we know whats in the game but suddenly it feels like you're watching from a window outside because all these streamers are playing and having fun.
---
Im glad to theorycraft now though and then wait to the actual release to try them out instead of burning out on a beta.
---
&gt; The "nerfed" AV version battles can still rage on for several hours.
---
But not days. 
---
Also you're baited.

This is pretty much what raiding was outside the toy train sets.

I don't even remember what I spent my gold on end game. But I'm pretty sure if there was an item to troll people in game, that's what I spent it on.
---
Having a loyal fan base is very different than Chinese bot farmers but I get your point.
---
Yep, look back to diablo 3 and kripparians world first inferno clear, people fed him thousands of dollars of loot essentially for free just for him to say a quick thanks.
---
People can and will definitely feed a streamer loot/gold to get in his good graces on the server especially with how much community aspects classic revolves around
---
Thank you so much I really appreciate this
---
Do you pick easy mode normally?
---
I‚Äôm kind of glad I didn‚Äôt get an invite because I wouldn‚Äôt be beta testing. I‚Äôd just be figuring out my leveling path and where and when I need to talk to which profession trainers and good farm spots for mats etc. I‚Äôd be pretty selfish with my invite so I‚Äôm pretty undeserving.

---
Yes
---
these kind of people are in fact the opposite of old
---
I skip it, lots of alternative weapons to get and the quest is really slow and annoying to do, and I could imagine on launch it being even worse.
---
Dude that sucks, I feel devastated or you :(
---
Possibly
---
I‚Äôm rolling a pvp shadow priest and I‚Äôm not compromising my build for the sake of raiding. We all have 15 years of experience, I think we can afford some sub optimal specs in the raids. And let‚Äôs be real, 99% of players in vanilla had bad talents anyway. You‚Äôre gonna be fine
---
When I leveled my shammy I focused mostly on agility mainly with a bit of strength and int when I could find them, agility is superior than strength for leveling due to granting dodge chance and armor which helps with surviving longer. 
---
So i'd say it's agility &gt; strength &gt;= intellect &gt; stamina &gt;= spirit.
---
At 60 it's a different story however, as you mostly want to focus on crit and attack power but since options are limited you will probably end up gearing/ rolling for the same stuff as hunters and rogues, except for weapons ofc.
---
I was actually just using it today and it's really nice. The biggest thing for me would loot tables for the different dungeons so I can decide which ones to run as I level.
---
I'm pretty sure you get Dishonor if you kill someone X amount of levels under you. (Maybe not, maybe it was only guards.)  
---
But I'll probably play on a PvE server when Classic comes. As odd as it sounds, I kinda want to be left alone and do my own thing most of the time. Let me farm, or fish, or just explore, which I didn't enough of in Vanilla because I was told it was several month race to 60
---
We will have to wait and see. There's so much speculation based on ideas that may or may not be true. We'll have to see if Classic really takes off. We hope it will, but we will not know until several months after release.
---
As for people demanding changes, again, who knows. It may be that some are needed, nothing is perfect.
---
you're making shit up. beta testers were prioritized -- non streamers included -- while stress testers were not. and of course streamers should have the names their public figure is known by, lol. why is this a problem to you unless you want to name yourself asmongold or sodapoppin?
---
No they won't, and the majority of players that did play vanilla, will come back and then leave after they beat MC a couple times. (If they make it that far)
---
Only reason being competition... not of another mmorpg (because classic will be the only one that offers what it does) but because there are too many other things and games to do.
---
Don't get me wrong, there will be people that play 1000 hours+, but classic will do nothing to change most peoples mind.
---
Which means we get to hear them complain for the first few weeks/months :)
---
A Warlock will always be welcome in a group.
---
Because he buffs the mage.
---
I'd like to second this. Ease of use is only as relevant as the content you're using. Since the database already beats everything else in terms of accessibility I'd recommend to focus on the data quality issue. 
---
Right now there's really no need to build additional ways to access the data.
---
Ally side Bonechewer player from vanilla here. It's been a loooong time! I've transitioned through 4 different servers since then. Not even in the same server region anymore üòÖ Moved from Bonechewer to Spinebreaker to Jubei'Thos to Frostmourne.
---
I'm an Aussie so I play Oceanic now. I remember back in Vanilla there was a heap of us on Bonechewer. Not sure why. I think maybe it was one of the top recommended realms in our geo region. I'm coming back for classic but I'll be playing Oce (given that there will be Oce realm/s)
---
I remember back in the glory days it was a great server. Steady population, some good guilds. I went back years later to jump on some old alts and it was like a ghost town üòêüòê not sure what happened.
---
The old divine spirit icon. Had forgot about that :)
---
I am not a streamer, but I am also in the beta. I had the same easy time getting in that streamers did. If you want to blame it on something, blame it on people with beta access having priority logins.
---
unique classes meaning, some specs are completely unplayable in high level pve or pvp unless you like to be sub sub sub optimal

Yep. My 19 rogue only ever had trouble with hunters, and even then it was maybe like 55/45

There hasn't been a mass market product that offered an open-world experience that expected something out of the player and rewarded investment in a long time. Maybe since Vanilla. 
---
Because of the hype, many people are going to get their first taste of aspiring to do something in a game, working for it, and eventually accomplishing it. Many of the kids will accept it. They kids will love it. This is their first chance to try it.

Yep, pretty much.
---
After BGs launched, it was thought that one was a PvP tree, the other the Raiding tree, and the third was the "leveling tree, but still had some cool things if you put 10 points or more in it."
---
With no gold, hard and slow leveling, running for ages and having to actually work and talk in a dungeon, plenty of people will be unable to handle it.
---
Ohh great! Can we use regexp? (Yes I know it's very specific demand but it can be insane)
---
Like eg:

---
Will match [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19970](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19970)

This can enable very very powerful search.

I‚Äôd say enchanting is a must, then your open to anything else. Maybe tailoring as you can create your own gear as you level. Or a generic material gathering skill to sell on.
---
Nice to see someone ask about that, im currently laborating with that exact solution! And if it all works out it should be implemented in near future ;)
---
You need some source or evidence for that claim if you want to be taken seriously.
---
And then they glitch out, despawn and it starts all over again!

All pre-raid BiS weapons are crossbows, and Rhok'Delar (the epic quest weapon) is going to last you until Chromaggus in BWL, which drops the 2nd best hunter weapon in the game, which is also a crossbow. The BiS weapon is the Nerubian Slavemaker, a Crossbow from Kel'Thuzad. AQ has no relevant Hunter ranged weapons, assuming you can get your hands on the BWL crossbow.

Maybe the next expansion, or even expansion after that. But BfA can't be saved at this point and I wish they'd focus completely on the next expansion after 8.2.

Your xp bar continued after 60 though.

\*yawn\* funny I guess. I still don't get it why people even give a fuck about streamers. Let me tell you a secret, don't watch them. Ignore them. Before launch look on the reddit post which will tell you what server they selected and avoid it. Don't waste your time with envy. Simpel steps of being happy.

So many delusional Gen Xers sounding like baby boomers who don't know the market because they don't go outside, casual games are more popular because gaming is more popular but most young people who remotely call themselves gamers have grown up on dark souls instead of castlevania, or playing slow open world or paradox strategy games that are more complex than ever

Low FPS, connection issues, not paying attention, talking to your phone while making the jump, being ignorant about that jump, space bar stacked or not working properly, etc . The list goes on :)

&gt;Context: this is not uncommon on retail that Healer will switch to DPS on certain bosses or phases just because heal is not needed. Is something like this a think on vanilla?
---
Not really until you outgear content, you basically waste mana and slow the dungeon down because you have to drink so much. But as a priest you can just wand constantly which adds a tiny bit of dps.
---

And the big problem with this is there‚Äôs going to be some innocent people getting black listed. It‚Äôs a bad idea that can‚Äôt be enforced properly. I understand streamsniping can be frustrating, but there‚Äôs not much you can do about it.
---
Yeah I hear you, ideally skill would be the determining factor. But this was still the case in vanilla no? 
---
They were just called no lifers instead of streamers back then.
---
And tbh I do not see much difference in the high warlord title or clearing Naxx... this is actually what I find so awesome about classic.. you know those things are there and attainable but only for the most dedicated players
---
I remember people did stealth 5-mans with 2 druids (tank/healer) and 3 rogues.  You could just farm the boss(es) you needed that way
---
Germans and sarcasm :D
---
Look up prebis for each class. Otherwise as a combo you'll be kicking ass so no worries there!
---
Anyone who prefers the 1.12 version of AV is patently incorrect. Unfortunately there's a lot of loud stupid people in the community.
---
I was a clicker until I played SWTOR, which came out around Cata (Which I didn't play) and no one noticed.
---
Having so many abilities on so many little CDs is what made me break the habit.
---
i think it will depend on what happens with the big popstreamers because those are beacons for the new kids and they hard carry the game's presence on twitch and when the game is at the top spots on twitch, for the kids it means that it is the hot shit to play right now because thats where all the attention is, and it overshadows potential bad sides that the game might normally have for their taste (grindiness patience, getting butthurt in pvp, graphics, whatever).
---
so i think it depends on whether these streamers will have the stamina for the grinds and work around getting streamsniped and whether blizzard starts babysitting them to keep them playing the game once they start getting griefed to shite and it starts touching their egos to the point of wanting to switch to other games. because once the game's category on twitch starts dropping, its a exponential snowball effect of everyone abandoning the ship and starting to shit on the game instead and that has potential to subconciously start demoralizing even the most hardcore players
---
I mean, I know it's hard to believe but there are also people who are actually testing stuff on beta. 
---
40 - 60 content should be tested too. Maybe not raids, but levelling to 60 should be tested at least.
---
Heeey, this is screenshots from EU-Tarren Mill :D. I remember the Guilds such as Nocturnal (A), Surge (H) and Mithrilguard (A). Maybe I'm there somewhere
---
A cool thing you could implement that no other site has, would be the ability to input stat weights ( ex. 1% hit = 20 strength, 1 stam = 0.8 strength etc.) and then be able to sort items in a slot by how good they are according to the stat weights you gave
---
mouseover pet attack works
---
I thought hitting the "D" key as a Hunter while auto shooting was kiting.
---
Good times!
---
Also stand between your target and other mobs, they always run away from you.
---
Minding the energy ticks is also crucial.
---
Dual wield at 10 for rogues, 20 for other classes as far as I can remember.
---
But my point wasn‚Äôt on equal terms. And he was responding to me. I‚Äôm saying if you‚Äôre more skilled racials dont matter.
---
Yeah, I get that. I remember getting killed by orcs in Burning Steppes because I went too far from Lakeshire and thinking damn that's strong. But surely the benefit of being able to feel like you can go through all the content without worrying about missing zones out or outpacing the zone outweighs the negative? I guess outpacing isn't as much of a problem in vanilla with more difficult leveling.
---
Tauren is love.
---
From memory SoR hits has a chance to proc on attack effects, so potentially the best case scenario it would double your SoC proc chance, and worst case it would be another bit of damage and a second chance to proc fiery, darkmoon damage trinket, the LBRS damage proc trinket and shadow oil
---
I agree the prospect of a coherent dichotomy would facilitate ludo-narrative cognizance. but without a player-to-market interface structure the value of integral composition becomes inconsequential, thus I propose a more flexible knowledge structure akin to a diagrammatic system of node based game play statuses. Without such a mechanism, the real 1:1 coherency becomes clouded by the players right the expect developmental streamlining. but I see where your coming from...
---
I don't even watch streamers anymore. Only staysafetv for background noise. I continue playing the games I always played like dark souls and tarkov for example. come august 27 I'll be jumping in fresh

How would a bfa fix work? Would all death knights, monks, demon hunters, panda characters just be deleted?

2.0.1 is technically not vanilla. Vanilla ended at 1.12.1. This is equivalent to going into MC at level 60 in TBC. This point actually makes this screenshot quite interesting.

No? Unsurprising.
---
I want to say I solo'd elite mobs in Silithus before they had any sort of quests or NPCs set up.
---
I just remember thinking there had to be something good those elite golden dragon wasps were hiding, because why would they put this area in.
---
But I could be wrong and do remember doing Timbermaw Rep in Felwood and Winterspring.
---
Dude, i wanted that trinket... as a Warlock.
---
&gt; We are going to finish them in 20 minutes anyway!
---
No, you're not.
---
Most of you will not even make it out of the lvl 6 starting zone without dying at least 3 times.
---
You still had to put in points to get last stand in case the tank died though.
---
Good luck finding 39 other people that want to show up to your attitude each week while they're trying to have fun.
---
Steamers wear super good gear. Thats all.
---
I completely agree. OG AV was a blast because it wasn‚Äôt just a bg but a full blown zone. You cold spend all day there, in the same game, grinding reps and knocking out quests or even just fishing if that‚Äôs what you were into. The sense of permanence gave it a wpvp vibe but with an actual win condition. Later versions, while they still had the quests there just wasn‚Äôt a reason to do them because the games were over so fast you‚Äôd miss the action and you didn‚Äôt need to use them to break a stalemate anyway
---
Yes, so you had to pre-plan what, and how much you take with you, and where to go, what to collect, what to leave behind, and when and how to return.
---
It's called playing an RPG.
---
And if you messed up, for example by wasting the Hearthstone CD for a minor travel, you found yourself in the middle of nowhere with no bagspace and a 10min walk ahead :D
---
It's called "actions have consequences".
---
The mod is from the future so your post was removed so this one isn't a repost
---
I will have something like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AoPBAfMCMaQ ^  ^
---
Does anyone know what server asgonmongols or smodagopping play on?
---
He didn't call for bans. Just to blacklist them, which imo is a dangerous idea because innocents could get caught in the crossfire.
---
so Talisman of Binding Shard?
---
I understood the first frame....... I'm old
---
Whoever wrote this bot should feel bad about it, about himself, and about every choice he has ever taken in life.
---
Same.....
---
Honestly, I personally won't have time to play classic. I will hop in from time to time and have some fun, but that's about it. Nonetheless, the fact someone could read your post and not see the point of it just makes my day xD
---
Nah man, I shitted on priests too pre level 40 when I leveled on my warrior..... 
---
LOL, yeah they suck ass. I can‚Äôt wait.
---
If  you type /campfire you respawn by your group.
---
not really
---
Yeah. If the mods disagree with a post they delete it and reference the rules.  Has happened to me a few times and it's fucked up. This one got to big so they can't delete it or they will get called out on it. Hopefully at some point the bad mod will be outed.
---
Im 100% sure this will not be in classic.
---
But this is really amasing and Im sad I found out about this 13 years to late.
---
That's metal
---
Here is my video of snowballing people, the best part was knocking people that were AFK out of the instance lol.

---
And he can choose with his friends how he responds...end of story
---
Yeah. The one they create their character on. 
---
Nobody has a server list so how would they know.
---
There is a vast power difference here. And I'm not willing to believe in the integrity of his character to not abuse his power. How long do you think something like that could go on before he gets banned?
---
Are warlocks easier to get a raid spot on alliance than horde? Is the difference as significant as people say (stuck between undead and human, dont care about wotf)?
---
I do totally agree with the last point. The low barrier to entry is one of the things that most annoys me about retail wow. Im just saying it's gonna be nice to be on a server with other ordinary(ish) people to compete with. And yeah im all for no lifers, but not no lifers with a massive fan base who carries them, trades them free items and gold, and is basically just a slave to the success of this one person..
---
My gf didn't even know what wow was before she met me. We are gonna be playing together come 27th of August. You don't need knowledge or skills or whatever. This is much like a d&amp;d adventure. You create your character, hit that enter button and you are inside mulgore,elwyn,darnasus whatever. You pick up and complete quests, you meet people, you buy items and you explore and learn about the world just like you would if you moved to a new city. The game is easy and every ability has a tooltip telling you exactly what it does. If you wanna master the game though, meaning optimal rotations, items etc. its gonna take some time. Also JOIN A GUILD. Not a hardcore one. Just a regular social guild. Your guildies are gonna be your best buddies in this game. Finally, if you are EU you can play with my group. All of my friends or total strangers to wow.
---
It makes zero sense, at all. Streamers exposed a ton of new people to classic and they are just blindly upvoting any "streamer good subreddit bad" posts.
---
servers will be named after streamers
---
I see that you played on Deathwing too, I guess we both originaly played on Deathwing, but migrated to Tarren Mill to avoid the queue's.
---
No difference. Warlocks are a part of the fabric of raiding regardless of faction or race.
---
Ok, I don't get this shit. Literally 99+% of the content here is non-art content. People make the same complaint over on r/DnD, it's dumb. This is a fantasy game with a history of great art, that people have had memorable experiences in. There is going to be art. You don't like it? Just scroll past like you do any other post you're not interested in. Don't be telling people not to share their art, that sucks.
---
Good. Be intimidated. Be fueled by adrenaline. It‚Äôs an amazing experience. 
---
If you‚Äôre on my server, let me know that you‚Äôre new; I‚Äôll give you free stuff. Gonna be giving freebies to all players I come across who are new to Classic/Vanilla.
---
Is there any practical use for Tauren herbalist boost at max level or is it just a convenience for levelling?
---
You don't even need to jump, you can walk off and still make it.
---
Careful. It's frowned upon here to like streamers.
---
But there's only a handful of streamers IN THE WORLD that make that kind of money. Thinking streamers make it big is like dropping out of college and thinking it'll make you into Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.
---
The worst timeline
---
Imagine taking the side of some multi-millionaires and just telling others to "get over it". Typical american.

Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time... A long time.
---
I don't know if other people would want this or not, but, one thing i miss from the old thottbot days that I haven't seen on any of the new sites (maybe it's there already and i just didn't find it?) ...
---
i think there was a "drops" tab on the dungeon zone page, that would list all of the drops from that dungeon and which boss it drops from. I thought that it was handy for e.g. deciding whether or not to go on that PUG run I see advertised.
---
Anyway - this site is great. Thanks for doing that.
---
In before ban
---
Well it's a good thing you made up your mind without taking a moment to figure out why people are flamimg them in the first place. Really "adult" of you!
---
Skinning/Mining/Fishing/Cooking if you want to make gold.
---
Herb/Alchemy/Fishing/Cooking if you want to be safer and more efficient while leveling.
---
Mining/Engineering/Cooking/First Aid for PvP.
---
You should always level First Aid and Cooking on characters.  Using bandages will increase leveling efficiency, even for classes that can heal.  Cooking is easy to kept leveled up, just kill every cat, dog, and raptor you see and get the recipes to cook their meats.  You get food buffs and the extras vendor for more than the materials would.
---
Couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth, but if it makes you feel better...
---
Why is there more video game competition today than back in Vanilla days? There were arguably more good games to play in 2005 than today.
---
Happens with warlock voidwalker too. Also sometimes my warlock pet just doesn‚Äôt attack when I hit attack.
---
Yes and no. During vanilla I would frequently fall down the pit in Ironforge- there was definitely lag involved but it wasn't latency lag so much as input lag due to extremely low framerate.
---
Actually, in BfA the NPCs scale to item level. You can't rush the Generals at all, the towers have to burn. You're just another guy who talks out his ass and doesn't have a clue, like all the people that thought mob damage was wrong.
---
&gt; There is no ultra-specific theorycrafting necessary in Retail WoW.
---
Quite the opposite. You simply cant mathematically solve these questions in a reasonable fashion. Simming is the solution to that.
---
Yes. BUT, they‚Äôve been conditioned since they started gaming that the Goodies come often and quickly. This is something unprecedented in their gaming (and probably even personal) lives.
---
Hehe yeah it's a super weird scenario how those followers are. It would actually be really interesting to see statistics on those diehard followers and how they are doing in life... sometimes when I see what those people, all I can think about is this how a cult functions

I never said only. I was generalizing. And generally speaking, the younger ones cry about difficulty WAY more than the older. Have you experienced something different?

Originally Horde, but now that I'm not an edgy teen I've ascended as the Gnome master race.

You are the best my naga! Appreciate your work

I dont think you understood the angle of OP's sarcasm.
---
run RFC at 14/15 for the [Axe of Orgrimmar](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15424)
---
Its true but sad
---
I was a shaman with Astral Recall, and even then I never deleted a Hearthstone.
---
Why would a picture from 2006 need to be colorized?
---
‚ÄúBut without the warmth‚Äù haha so so true
---
That happened in classic to me and to everyone else.
---
Following guides you'll be playing someone elses game. Why tf play at all?
---
Just dive in...especially with a buddy...and experience everything on your own.
---
You get much more joy and entertainment this way. The game is set to last for years, dont rush.
---
Outright wrong. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre REALLY young, judging by the fact that your entire post was a single, barely coherent sentence.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that I offended you, kid; but it is what it is. I hope that you enjoy Classic.
---
No they did not have a prioritised queue, boomer.
---
Had anyone gotten Pendulum of Doom on beta yet?
---
Ne hunter was my main on a pserver. Its just awesome to have shadowmeld and a cat with prowl. Really useful while leveling and in pvp. Shadowmeld saved me alot of times. Feign death shadowmeld and let the pet attack.
---
Thank you this is great!
---
It would be cool, if possible, to have the patch in which the items was added/last updated in the quick facts box.
---
There‚Äôs no global server chat in real vanilla - that‚Äôs a private server thing.  Sure you can make a chat channel called ‚Äúworld‚Äù if you want but it has a max size of 50 and you‚Äôll see people join/leave it and one person in there will have moderator rights
---
Just from testing RFD, my group has already found two bugs in the instance. ZF has glitchy walls as well and that‚Äôs just two dungeons. We‚Äôve still got plenty more to test and this is just at 40.  
---
Why not have us test everything that will be in phase 1? Even if they have a separate testing server for raids or 60 content on NDA to keep a bit of suspense, that‚Äôs fine. I just don‚Äôt want to play on release and have bugs riddled in the higher level content since it wasn‚Äôt tested and have to play through it for a few weeks until it gets fixed.
---
are you serious or just being ironic?
---
I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to why people don‚Äôt understand. Ignoring the fact that it‚Äôs been discussed to death, most of the reasons are fairly easy to see. The only thing worse at this point than not understanding are the people who continue to insist it‚Äôs just whining or bitterness and refuse to give any validation to the laundry list of legitimate reasons.
---
Imagine letting streamers be the death of your childhood game. Pathetic.
---
Maybe a feral/resto hybrid?
---
My new sword gives me a 3.6 increase in dps!
---
If you want psudo world pvp u went to hearthglen or tyrs hand.
---
You deserve it for calling it VC
---
Why drop tailor? Arent bags really important?
---
"ITS DM NOT VC"
---
Ah, yes. I haven‚Äôt factored in Streamer popularity. This is another enormous variable I haven‚Äôt even considered. Goddamn, I can‚Äôt wait to find out!
---
&gt; There were arguably more good games to play in 2005 than today. 
---
 Indie studies were not as common in the mid 2000s
---
PSA: you can get a new hearthstone from any innkeeper.
---
Great post.
---
I don't really agree with you about flying in TBC. For me it was the most amazing goal and you had to grind your ass off to get the epic riding, flying and the mount. Sure after you got it you were able to skip content, but by that point your character has paid its dues and you are at the end game. It also unlocked areas like the elemental plateau so we could grind for our much needed motes.
---
Offering yourself as a rent-a-tank for dungeons or raids, playing the market, leveling an alt.
---
I r o n I c, play what the fuck you want
---
Lmao... underrated comment for the day for me.  I‚Äôd honestly laugh so hard if this were true.   
---
Make it happen Blizzard!
---
I mostly know allliance, but I like elwynn a lot. 
---
The early level cats (darnassus) and bears (ironforge, but it has cats too) don't actually drop any meat, so boars and wolves are better for leveling your professions, and I feel like the night elves have some wierd quest bottlenecks. Specifically, twisted hatred has no business being as tough as it is (what the hell is with lord melenas?), and that chest in the furbolg camp that takes forever to respawn and is always camped, but is also part of a quest chain and doesn't appear to be shareable: if you show up as 5,you have to wait for 5 spawn windows, unlike goldtooth who just drops 5 necklaces.
---
Elwynn has some challenge. Specifically, it can be a bit rough fighting the murlock foragers at low level with their self heal, and the prowlers have a ton of pushback due to super fast attack speed and generally hit like trucks, and the bandits who chain knockdown. But it doesn't have any real bullshit quests (like that lord melenas, who is a level 8 non elite mob that seems to almost one shot, and it's generally pretty easy to actually find the entrance to most quests, unlike the night elf barrow dens, which I still don't know how to find. 
---
The skinning trainer also isn't like a 5 minute walk from the starting zone, which is nice, and is somewhat near the trade goods vendor so you can't forget to buy a skinning knife and have to trek halfway across the zone the other way.
---
lol, of course I can play the fuck I want, i just wanna know if Nelf has something deffensive like Stoneform in terms of objects, trinkets whatever that allow me to stand a chance againdt a rogue.
---
The fact that its not a comic about how somebody gets upset that you called it VC is just a massive missed opportunity.
---
That is the RPG ability immersion that I need. Plz fix aoe fears blizz #NoChanges
---
The streamer and guide maker Kargoz has lots of guides in case you haven't seen his videos yet. As far as reading material, take a look at his vids in slide format. He has tons of guides from professions to leveling -- like the ones below. Keep in mind these are based on private servers, but they are Google docs, which I imagine he will keep updating as the information changes.
---

Bags are important, but you will get 16 slot bags from world drops. Making the mooncloth bags are not worth it in my opinion.
---
Come on man, everyone knows after you miss the jump you stand still for 10 or so seconds and then ask if anyone else just lagged. Then proceed to angrily complain about lag or ping all the while stopping every 20 seconds to produce the illusion that the lag that caused you to miss the jump is somehow still affecting you. After killing the last boss, you restart and come back in and the lag is 'fixed'
---
While I agree with the dark souls angle, a bit, I would wholeheartedly disagree about the pdx games. I play everyone one almost, Eu4, Ck2, SM, Imper, Stel, and HoI, and frequent their sub very very often. Mention min/maxing in any of those subs and you get floods of ideas how to improve/exploit better, here you get flamed for not enjoying lvling or taking my time.
---
A heart of the wild Druid with separate sets of gear I‚Äôd assume?
---
None of the healers DPS particularly well, and there is no dual spec.
---
I see you fixed rhino's horn and position
---
First time hearing of this, okay.
---
I‚Äôve almost never NOT leveled as a Tauren and through Mulgore. I barely played an orc recently  and ran through Valley of trials as a Tauren in BC once to get the doggo. But yea I‚Äôve always played Tauren and I think I‚Äôm going orc for vanilla (kuz armor looks much better on them as well as animations)
---
I don't want the old AV, I don't want a PvE BG. People may argue that the rush through AV is a PvE BG but it has way more options for real PvP than the PvE version of AV that is the 1.5 version. I'm firmly on the side of later version of AV is a MUCH beter BG.
---
2 Armor
---
You pick your poison and there is no clearly "better" decision. 
---
Whether it's ability to ambush people from stealth or pretty hard rogue counter (also helpful against spriests and hunters).
---
37 dicks?!?
---
Im doing the same. Full time tank life here we come. My plan is to level with Mining and Skinning to start with. I'm going to make getting my epic mount my #1 priority in Classic, as I'm not going to be able to raid to a schedule (newborn will see to that!). But once I've got my epic riding Im dropping skinning for Engi for obvious tanking-related reasons.
---
Will probably do some Onyxia runs before I get my epic though so skinning her can net you a pretty penny if you have the rare skinning knife. Thats if her hide is tradable. I dont remember.
---
Other good way to make gold as a tank in classic is hire your tanking services out for groups. Usually with some sort of reserve arrangement. Like "first Crusader Orb on reserve" or "all trash grays". You can make a lot of gold that way. As well as get your name out into the community as a skilled tank and (I assume) a good guy! Reputation is all.
---
There are some consumables like antivenoms that can help against rogues' poisons, though I don't know about the rest.
---
Done it numerous times myself. Jumping for 90% of the dungeon but the time I‚Äôm actually required to jump I fuck it.
---
Yeah, I remember thinking why would my xp bar stay there. I had no idea expansions existed back then.
---
Because of multishot and aimed shot scaling you always want a slow weapon in PvP or PvE. Bows will give you more spell push-back in PvP but it's not a good trade-off compared to juicy aimed shots off a freezing trap.
---
Hunters already have poor scaling in PvE without gimping themselves for gear and having a faster weapon will interfere heavily with your rotation's output.
---
Do people secretly hate resto druids in dungeons because they don't have a normal Rez?
---
I fucking disagree on yoloing everything. Learning a few things, like you can tank in any spec as war, makes the gameplay way more fun that rerollong because you specced protection. Now, not watching a leveling guide can be fun.
---
mani aint got no time for for that. i'm looking for the good players who only talks when necessary.
---
If you want short battles go play other BGs
---
That will comeback once the game gets released
---
nice!
---
I think with preach, he doesn't have the retarded fanbase that have to follow him around. You'll see it in his TDP in current wow, they might say hi or omg its preach once or twice. But he wont have a 40 man raids following him around like asmon or soda.
---
So it dissapeared after a logout I suppose ?
---
It really depends on which of the people who I originally played with during Vanilla come back and what they decide to roll. If they roll Alliance, I will absolutely be going Gnome Mage as my first character on Classic and will replicate the character look 100% too.
---
Not sure what I will pick if they all decide to roll Horde. Plus I don't actually know what interest there is yet in playing Classic amongst my former Vanilla friends/guildmates.
---
There are a bunch of people I know that used to play wow from vanilla days but quit recently because it wasn‚Äôt the same anymore. They had no idea that the beta or even the classic re release existed. So I expect there to be more people who don‚Äôt know about it. Those numbers are going to comeback, but like most games numbers are always the highest when new content is released.
---
I got into beta recently and I thought I would hardcore play nonstop and I did for the first 12 hours. Now im lvl 23 and going real slow and just exploring the game.
---
On release though, I definitely plan on staying up for 48hrs with a few 30 min power naps.
---
Dwarf is the patrician‚Äôs choice. The fact that you‚Äôve considered to play a Night Elf over it means that you should probably play as a treehugger.
---
He is also wearing robe of volatile power which is also not until Phase 2.
---
Pretty sure that's not the right amount of xp for that quest to. No clock or calander but somethings off. The xp bar would fill up so when bc came out you could basicly auto lvl to 61.
---
Why is nobody in the Beta playing Arathi Basin?
---
How do you reserve loot in dungeons as a tank? F.e Strat live the first ROrb drop or Flask recipe, do you have it on master loot or do you trust people not to roll for it? Same with Ironfoe in BRD.
---
How boring does Paladin levelling get? I've seen a few videos at level 30-40 and it takes 40s to kill an appropriate level mob.
---
Hi, /u/DorDorOz
---
Sweet wotlk child
---
was not expecting something actually funny on this sub
---
Shadowmeld very powerful in PvP, you can aim shot from it
---
The quality of relevant games to play back then was higher than today. Because of the gaming industry blowing up, more games have to come out per year, therefore reducing quality. Think Call of Duty. And more gamers = more diluted community = less hardcore = less depth = less quality (IMHO)
---
Companies are discouraged from taking 10 years to make a good game.
---
Can confirm - though summoned stones disappear
---
Ahckshually that‚Äôs only for classic.wowhead.com 
---
I can‚Äôt wrap my head around your assumption that someone on this board doesn‚Äôt know about the cata revamp.  
---
Blizzard didn‚Äôt edit your site, they removed quests and NPCs from a game and your site updated to reflect.   So yeah you did.
---
Priest
---
I've heard it's a bit easier to get into raids as alliance purely because less people roll alliance warlock (because wotf is something of a hard counter to warlocks).
---
This comment is pure cringe and shows how deep you are a part of this echochamber and circlejerk by this Content Creator
---
Pretty nice photo.
---
The agony of being a warlock
---
&gt; Alliance 'locks have to PvP against WotF. Not great. 
---
Oh please, stop with this twisted argument. Nobody chooses their class based on racials anyway, but a tiny elitist minority very vocal on Reddit. According to that logic Alliance Rogues would be super rare because of orcs Stun Resist, and Alliance Priests would also be rare because of WotF on the opposing faction. And it is not the case.
---
&gt; Horde 'locks have to PvE without Salvation. Not great. 
---
The average player doesn't even know what Salvation is, left alone people who roll only Horde characters.
---
&gt; Locks PvP poorly against melee, which is expected to be pretty strongly represented. Not great. 
---
This is simply untrue. And I'm not even talking about SL locks which can virtually ***not*** loose against melees. Rogues are a pain to everybody when they have all their CDs, but the rest of the time they die in 3 dots. Warriors go down very fast too if you have death coil up, and aren't a specially bad match either.
---
Interesting. About 5k characters. If we say horde is the same, that's 10k characters observed over the course of a week. This means that if every beta tester has only one character, there's just 10k active testers. In reality it's probably closer to half of that since anyone who has been seen with a level 2 bank alt counts for two players. Given the fact that some players have 3-4 characters or more, it's very possible that there's no more than a few thousand active testers.
---
As a guy who mained hunter all through Vanilla, there is so much to love about this video.  
---
Specced 31 pts into Survival
---
Spamming arcane shot until OOM. 
---
The frost trap that is perfectly placed to NOT slow any adds
---
Aimed Shot not even on bar  
---
Its too bad we cant mindwipe ourselves when we start playing classic again. One thing that we can never replicate is how bad at the game we were.
---
Who was this?
---
Depends if they are good friends or not, if they are choose them.
---
Streamers themselves are fine
---
Its their followers. They will overpopulate a realm, give ressources to streamers, report you for ganking and "ninjaing" an item from a streamer and they will also leave the server if (when) the streamer quits. This in addition to spamming stale memes from twitch chat like pog and omegalul. 
---
You have to understand that even streamers themselves hate their own audience.
---
I wanted to preface I use you's DB more frequently than the others as it usually seems to be more accurate and have infro the others are lacking. That said, there are many missing pages, how can the community flag these/help?
---
Ie on Zones-&gt;Dungeons there is no L/UBRS, and on Zones-&gt;Raids there is no Onyxia's Lair, no L/UBRS  there either.
---
I expect 99% of them never making it to 60, it's a serious time commitment. 
---
Let alone getting gear, it's 1000% more harder then current retail wow.
---
You make accusations, but offer no proof or elaboration. 
---
Bro, are you mad? Lolllll...... Come on. How old are you? I hope you aren‚Äôt proving my point. That would be way too funny.
---
Well this is depressing lol
---
Ass-Moonglade RPPvP
---
Isn't there LFG tho?
---
I dunno, I left mine unchecked because I have no desire to play beta. I did play beta back in Vanilla. It was cool but it was an *actual* new game at that time.
---
Maybe he has no self control and really would burn out.
---
Played vanilla to MC/ZG. Played private servers to Naxx. I‚Äôve seen the content. I finished it several times. Have been on private server break ever since blizzcon announcement. Saving myself for real classic. Super hyped. I‚Äôm ready.
---
sorry sounded like you meant multiboxing made the game more of a challenge
---
As a dwarf hunter,is guns bis or should you get lokdelar bow from mc and so on anyway?
---
I could understand a couple days leading into the weekend but taking 2 entire weeks off of work to play a video game is mind boggling to me, unhealthy even. But hey, to each their own.
---
I think playing with friends &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;solo, but if you can't convince them to play horde, why not play both and have one as alt?
---
This is funny because I have no friends that play wow
---
Nelf hunter for sure! Shadowmeld + Cat with Prowl is just too much fun in world PvP and BG.
---
Then you see a random goblin tradesman with a rare recipe üòú
---
They are busy getting BiS. God forbid they try pvp w/o those. lol
---
found a pizza cutter. all edge and no point.
---
Like other people has said, would be really neat to look at a Dungeon and be able to see all the bosses and the drops from them. You have to manually search for bosses in dungeons 1 by 1 to see their droptable.
---
Calling someone a kid is not really mature, i hope you are aware of that.
---
My attitude as well. Did PvE in vanilla, PvP on p servers, and gonna go back to PvE for classic. I work a lot now and mostly only play duo leveling with a friend, so we only end playing a few hours a week. Flying from Ashenvale to Hillsbrad to start questing only to find all the questing spots are being camped by alliance is the worst. It's just an utter waste of what precious time I get to play. 
---
Actual fun world PvP moments are so few and far between, 90% of the pvp we'd do was someone 5+ levels higher than us ganking after a series of tough pulls, annihilating us, and then running away so we can't return the favor on Res.
---
I bet anyone in the sub would love to be in your position, to see this world with fresh eyes and not to know what's around the next corner or the intricacies of min/maxing your character (I'm sure some would love to be blissfully unaware).
---
But this game is perfect for newcomers, we all were once and that's why we're all so passionate about it now. Jump into it blind and get to know the world yourself! Save the googling of answers and whatnot until you've got a firm footing in Azeroth. 
---
Happy adventures!
---
I post earlier, but this post is now hidden from the front page of classic wow because it isn't in line with the beliefs of the mods. Something really needs to be done about this shit. We are being censored.
---
Big hitter the Lama.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs called trade chat and it‚Äôs accessed while in a main city.
---
I will be sleeping when this image is correct. Then I will go to work, thinking of when I can go home and login
---
Yeah there was, there's was a global LFG channel in 1.11, you just type /join LFG.
---
Lol. It‚Äôs fine... think about it. This was the case with Chuck Norris and ANAL, and Thunderfury. 
---
Sometimes I would see an Anal Chuck Norris Thunderfury comment in chat. Whatever. Same shit, different day.

Bro, do you want to be an elf with a cat or a dwarf with a bear?  This is no choice at all, my friend.
---
First aid is kind of garbage to pair with tailoring since they are competing for the same mats, so I usually go cooking on clothies too. Mage food is great but the real reason to cook is for food buffs. Also healing classes benefit more from cooking than first aid.
---
I think it is the slowest leveling class with not much to do other than auto attack. I like the class a lot but I'd have some netflix shows ready to be binge watched.
---
This post just got shadow banned from the front page of classicwow because we are supposed to hate streamers without question. What the frick is going on with this sub.
---
You can get a consumable called Jungle Remedy to remove poisons and diseases. If you're tryharding, you will beat 99% of people at 60 as a well geared/played hunter regardless of race choice. I prefer NElf and it is definitely the superior choice for battlegrounds.
---
I‚Äôve always loved Durotar. Granted, by the time you reach the Barrens, I‚Äôm usually dying to go anywhere with more color and vibrancy. But easily my favorite starting spot. Elwynn is great with the exception of the murlocs. Murlocs are the absolute worst, especially early on.
---
Do you think Classic will be successful enough to kill Retail?
---
As a vanilla healer it was a completely shock that most dps didnt have all raid windows up, always felt like it would be weird not seing when ppl died.
---
I remember reading that the game calculates skill ups based on your base  Herbalism without the racial. So if a plant is orange at level 80 herbalism, goes yellow at 100, and goes green at 120, you will only require 65 Herbalism to pick it as a Tauren, but will continue getting skill ups off it as if it were orange until 100, even though you have 115 as far as picking goes. Effectively, it makes leveling Herbalism a lot easier because you have wider brackets where you get a guaranteed skill up.
---
As far as I know, however, there aren't any plants that require more than 300 Herbalism to pick, so going above 300 with the racial (or Herbalist Gloves or +Herbalism enchant) only serves to reduce the fail rate when picking high-level herbs.
---
Heartstone \*and\* totems? Big Oof.
---
This.. This right here. Guess someone saw a post from /r/art with this in their title :-)
---
Nelf with cat (also I thing that the best pet for pvp is a cat). But I don't want to be defendless against rogues...
---
Yes but like I said, I don‚Äôt expect to make it past MC. Is there any good shaman gear (not tier 1, that‚Äôs for resto or ele resto) in MC?
---
Friends always over faction, the gme is hlf fun without them

Yes comrade.
---
If you want lesser wand at the beginning: go tailoring, build a couple of green robes with the stuff you find from mobs. Afterwards you disenchant it and you got the materials for your wand. If you want you can drop those proffesions now and go for herb/alchemy etc. Instead
---
nah i think it just stayed there
---
Undead, always run to undead
---
I think it was nerfed during some patch iirc.
---
What else should I say when some kid calls my post cringe and the replies cancer? I could have been much more immature.
---
Actual LFG. I have no clue seeing as I started in BC, when I was 7. I guess it doesn't?
---
&gt; They already said
---
Oh like how they said they wouldn't do classic?
---
I have an idea, play human and pretend it's your undead char before he died. Sorted
---
Elwynn. No contest.
---
It wasn't for everyone but some people did love it and enjoy it.
---
Put it this way, the people who hated original AV didn't turn on a coin and love the new AV.
---
No, you said studies, not studios.  I thought you were talking about Studies as in data. As in only independent groups would have gathered such data back then.
---
you could also not call names, being more mature
---
AV is not with launch, they have time.
---
What are your specs?
---
LFG chat was introduced in TBC.
---
You keep all the HK's you got in those 2 hours.
---
Whats your specs? Will GTX 960 run it in 1440p?
---
It's a joke
---
Stoneform is nice but not mandatory. Hunters already hard counter Rogues and if you are specced correctly and have consumables you will be just fine.  
---
Shadowmeld is cute. It let's you do some great tricks in Wpvp and gives you an edge defending in bgs.  
---
Ultimately it makes very little difference for your average Hunter. You should play whichever you prefer aesthetically.
---
It's a joke..
---
I think there are enough people that still enjoy retail and those who will try classic and not make it far due to the length of time that's required to level that will stick to retail and keep it going.
---
Sounds like you didn't play the original.
---
Sure I could. I could also live in Ethiopia and try to feed the entire country. 
---
Calling names? You aren‚Äôt my mom. Come on. The kid called me cringe cancer. I‚Äôll call him a kid. It‚Äôs fine.
---
&gt;Let's be real, the reason Asmon has a key is not to bug-report... Come on dude.
---
except he has reported bugs before. The time he was doing WSG the 1st day it was available. He literally stopped mid match..in the midfield to send 2 bugs reports that caused his team to lose. Then  later. Doing the 1st SM clear with those 2 hunters. 1 of hunters clean said that their hunters mark were stacking. he then tells them and his audience of 50k at the time to not report the bug. If blizzard didn't want bug reported. They wouldn't force the bug report to stay on screen at all times. Just because you like something or someone. Does not mean that they can do wrong.
---
I think you are right, I tried to convince them but they don‚Äôt want to. I work about 50hours/week so I won‚Äôt have time to play an alt I guess. 
---
But damn, it breaks my heart not playing UD üòÖ
---
They decided alliance side and I can‚Äôt decide because they will play more than 10 hours a day and I won‚Äôt :)
---
There's s reason why there is no "Esfand but for balance druids"....
---
It‚Äôs just weird to spell out twitch emotes in WoW
---
Not with you gear lol.
---
It worked when it was a picture of something modern that was supposed to be from like 1470.
---
It doesn't work when it's a more modern date.
---
There is no native LFG system. Forming groups was accomplished using trade channel and addons.
---
&gt;I get that he's streaming, so it got seen and was probably reported, but it just came off supremely scummy.
---
people watching asmond dont have beta. non beta players cannot submit bug reports. they dont even have access to the beta forums.
---
Thanks my boy haha. I told my friend who‚Äôs going to play human that he can play a dead human but he‚Äôs not convinced üôÉ
---
Dormammu, I've Come To Bargin!
---
Fuck the current meta.
---
Troll priests have hex of weakness, and while it doesn‚Äôt reduce healing as much as mortal strike, it‚Äôs arguably better because it has no CD, a 30 yard range, and also reduces the damage the target deals. So while MS reduces the healing a single target takes by more, HoW can reduce the healing an entire enemy team takes. 
---
Your other points still stand though. I was really tempted to roll a warrior just so I had a reason to roll on Ashbringer and a means to see it drop lol
---
I have no idea what you just said. How do you expect me to know what that means?
---
You realise how far those patches are from each other?
---
Thanks man. I try to convince myself that the game is better with friends :)
---
wtf is a VC are u retarded?
---
What's the threshold for not getting rep exp anymore from quests?
---
+5 levels?
---
Because they are going with the 1.12 version of items there are dungeon blues on par or very close in power to the ring and the belt.
---
My idea is to get to 60, then make twinks, if exp locking is enabled.
---
I think blizzard will upgrade classic to BC... Nullifying all raid/gear progress...
---
Could of been a similar name you losers.
---
We decided with my friends to all jump back into wow for bfa, we had some fun like 2 weeks then everyone slowly started playing less and less, until we all quit. We really wanted to get back into wow... but nope. The news about classic was amazing, all of us really have the itch and we never actually experienced classic fully. Going to be a good winter, even if the weather is shit like the last one.
---
I remember first playing as a kid, getting a tabard and some shoulders made me feel like a beast.
---
&gt;It doesn't work when it's a more modern date.
---
That's the joke
---
but he picks and chooses what bugs to report. the 1st day WSG was out. he literally stopped during the match in the mid field to report 2 bugs that caused his team to lose.
---
Does it strike anyone else as odd that on a Saturday night there's only about two hundred people between level 35 and 40? Most active testers will have reached 35 by now, right?
---
My understanding is that a palidan tank's biggest concern is maximizing threat, since they don't have a taunt (other than BoP). Devotion is probably alright against single target, but 90% of the time you'll be using retribution for the bonus threat. It's one of the things that makes paladins arguably the best multitarget tanks in the game.
---
so you're saying is not like escape artist in gnomes mages against human mages which makes a big difference.
---
if people like you are in the classic cominity i fear for classic
---
So it's anti-humor?  It's not funny *on purpose?*
---
Van cleef
---
I have had to stop looking at the calendar because I know it‚Äôs so far away.... it has made all the other games I play boring and unfulfilling I can‚Äôt wait to go back home again.
---
Quit your bullshit
---
Think again, because there are adults capable of threatening to death game devs who do things they don't like, no kid would ever even think of doing something like that.
---
Yes, just for stupid game changes.
---
people do both but there's nothing at all a gm will do if a rogue outrolls you on ironfoe or etc so best to switch loot  style before hand.
---
Played dagger rogue and was so disappointed when I spent all my dkp on boots of the shadow flame and they looked atrocious
---
Oh, okay. Thanks ^^
---
If any of my friends decided after all this time to suddenly want to roll Alliance, I'd wonder about the validity of the friendship. Traitors! Kidding. Sorta.
---
Lmaooooo
---
I have absolutely zero idea what tge crow is saying. Pls?
---
sorry was on mobile earlier, yep studios\*
---
and aaa as in Triple A\*
---
I'd like to make a swing for the Night Elf zone. The layout is really good. You have a natural progression closer and closer to your capitol city, and quests are tightly clustered compared to Elwyn, which is a mile wide, and has the endzone quests stuck at either extreme ends of the place.
---
And you can easily fish up your cooking once you hit 10-12 or so and reach Darn.
---
That‚Äôs the potential magic: if enough people enjoy it, it means a Paradigm Shift for the Gaming Industry. 
---
If enough people enjoy it, that means their mentality as a gamer has also changed. They will expect this from other games. This is HUGE.
---
Have you played Vanilla? Lol... nah man. 30min-1hour dungeons if no wipe. I‚Äôve certainly had 4 hour dungeons before, though. But definitely not average.
---
Does transformation effects change your hitbox?
---
Say if I was as a Tauren to pop Noggenfogger Elixir, would I receive the hitbox of a human? Or if I use Orb of Deception, that of a Gnome?
---
&gt; chest in the furbolg camp that takes forever to respawn
---
Not sure if they'll keep it this way, but ground object quest items were respawning pretty quickly on the Beta.  
---
I'll go check if that's still true actually. Brb.
---
Someone stole this on Insta
---
Like the guild name
---
This is a recipe for disaster.  If you‚Äôre anything like me, the game will fuck your studying right up.
---
They're pretty equal really, not many other choices so equal other than orc/UD warlock maybe. Shadow meld is so good in premade pvp I would go nelf personally
---
Talking about brd, dm, ubrs, lbrs....
---
Not low level dungeons...
---
That's why you play a Warlock with the Alchemy skill.
---
Healthstone, soulstone, and pots, OH MY!
---
If Classic takes off in a major way and brings in the young gamers, it will transcend WoW, and bleed into the entire Gaming Industry.
---
If the young gamers enjoy Classic, their mentality as gamers will change from feeling reward from being Spoon Fed, to feeling reward from working hard. The industry will cater to them and make good games again.
---
I'm pretty sure they tested this on the beta and proved that it did effect the hit box.
---
Why are Retail raid frames not a bigger issue? I thought everybody wanted #NoChanges but nobody seems to be discussing this issue.
---
Odd. Shaman is normally right in the middle, behind mage/rogue/warrior and ahead of druid/priest/warlock.
---
If you mean collusion detection like doors, then yes you can fit through doors.
---
Exactly this, and a blast to stay completely hidden while guarding a flag in BGs.
---
Maybe the moonkin east of auberdine? I don't recall having quests needing to kill them.
---
Paradosi lol
---
Why avoid, when you can kill them...
---
Form a mega anti streamer guild and kill them until they quit the game...
---
Problem solved ..
---
This looks like an earlier patch. The UI is older, maybe pre 1.9.
---
It wasn't until a later patch did the XP bar disappear when you reached max level.
---
I think they are twitch emotes
---
But when you get to the plague lands! OH BOY YOU GET TO HIT EXORCISM TOO!
---
What are you talking about? Did this actually happen or are you just letting your imagination run wild?
---
Who do you think you‚Äôre scolding? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a more condescending post directed at literally no one
---
Or they could play without steaming and not tell people who they characters are
---
You have literally zero chance if you work a 9-5. The top premade dictates who is in the top brackets and you won't be in it if you're not playing 14+ hours most days. The minimum amount of time it takes is 12 weeks if you're in bracket 1 every week. After all the tryhards have finished ranking, it becomes easier to get R14 but you will still need to be play an awful lot every single day and be in the premade that is setting the brackets (i.e. has the ability to play more than everyone else currently ranking if need be).
---
There is a native LookingForGroup channel. You didn't have to use trade.
---
They're gonna stop playing and you're gonna have to reroll with so much time wasted.
---
You already know it.
---
Just have some jumper cables on hand, it'll be good enough.
---
Thanks!  I found my old Photobucket account and lots of screenshots were in there.  I thought this one was cute.
---
reddit selects for wackos - don't worry about it. The game will be different.
---
I don't have too much experience with the modern game, but the biggest difference I've noticed from screwing around in there is that nobody talks to one another there. I expect that classic will be much more social.
---
Retail is different than classic.  You gotta be more specific. And besides - most end gamers were using add ons like xperl
---
You don't even have to jump. Just walk off the ledge and land on the other side.
---
I'd understand using them if there was an addon that replaced the text with the equivalent twitch emote otherwise just looks dumb using them in normal chat.
---
That first cape at around level 5 and first shoulderpads at around level 15 felt glorious back in the day.
---
Oh yeah. Do moonkins drop feathers? I think druids have the bear form quest there, but they don‚Äôt need to kill any moonkins except for one.
---
LOL, oh yeah. I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about those, to be perfectly honest. I was completely focused on how they would have quit before even making it Sunken Temple.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right. They‚Äôre in for a surprise.
---
Alice Deejay and Darude
---
Got to read them donations first.... The raid can wait, I'm the main tank...
---
Got to read the donations again, what happen we wiped, I'm the main tank, healer fault...
---
How to waste 39 people's time course your the streamer...
---
My response was hyperbolic and childish sure, but assuming there's not gonna be problems come launch is pretty naive. See, the beauty of the classic launch is that we'll all start from 0, everyone is gonna try to make a name for themselves and enjoy a universe on an equal opportunity. Streamers will bypass this and appropriate the realms like it's their realm, reaching milestones before everyone else, will be able to control the economy and will largely influence said realm, because they can.People tend to hate streamers because of jealousy sure, but can you understand people being annoyed by privileges on a game based off of merit ? Can you understand that gaymers are pissed when soda says he's an asshole so he's allowed to camp but everyone who does the same to him will be blacklisted and thus not be able to play the game because everyone will side with mister streamer dad? Thankfully I'll be enjoying the game on my little EU realm where anything will be possible and as you said, can't wait for launch so the "streamers realms will be like other realms" idea gets debunked.
---
Unless you‚Äôre a mage or even a shaman.
---
That's not a raiding U.I, there's still screen real estate! Get that bejeweled add 9n, the weather bug widget and then put the terminator calls add on up that put a giant t-1000 in the screen for the Raid Warnings. That's when you have a true raider U.I.
---
so you people (alliance I assume) also call "Mutanus" or "Devourer" or "the giant murlock" instead of "WC"?
---
It's not unfunny. It's obviously playing in the date not being that old.. it's really not a joke that should need this much discussion. You didnt get it,its ok
---
It's almost a curse... of agony.
---
what does that matter?
---
Then it's rude to say everyone to shut up :(
---
They get entitled
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk)
---
The raidframes in the Beta are not the raidframes from Vanilla. That's the issue.
---
I don't think there was a fail rate on herbs back then. you either could or you couldn't.
---
I say this because I was an Alchemist in vanilla (Still am) and getting those last few skill points to be able to gather Black Lotus was a pain. 
---
(Which only spawned at one node in an entire zone and took several hours to respawn at any other random node!)
---
Better go the whole hog and make the inn's floor sticky.
---
I've leveled both horde and alliance warlock at 60, Gnome was my original and UD i did later on. What i dont see mentioned a lot is that Alliance have 2 dispell magic classes, Horde only have priest to dispell. so in bgs as horde it seems like your bound to always have multiple people dispelling your DoTs or Succ. I didn't notice a diff on either side needing more or less locks for raiding. Warlock is one of the least played class and the raids always need curses and banishes so always asking for a lock to fill a guild.
---
Not great, not terrible.
---
A disc priest could put PI on the mage. :)
---
Why is ability to mail few items at once not a bigger issue?
---
Nah because of DM also stands for Dire Maul and some people prefer to call Deadmines bien VF.
---
Play with friends man it will be much better and more fun, also you will have a different experience altogether with still thee same nostalgia feels! I feel ya tho my friends wanted to play alliance but i convinced them to go horde, good luck (also gnome mages look awesome)
---
Thanks mate, btw are you from Switzerland or why have you taken a swiss domain? :)
---
You will always get a Raid spot as a Warlock
---
Because people need Summons, Healthstones, Soulstone a healer to rez everyone after, and of course, and most importantly, to buff the mages (but you only need one for that)
---
Just watched this. Thank you for the meme.
---
Well balance, bouancy, and ballast come to mind. Not to mention that anything in the water can get in the way. Sand silt and the like if it's a natural body of water.

Beats having a bag full of arrows or soul shards lol

The only changes they have made for the most part are simply QoL changes. Raid frames in vanilla were complete dogshit

i've fucked in the water, and balance was a problem. but it wasnt a logistics problem. everything still works the same lol

You probably also don't remember mages having the Twin Blades of Azzinoth.
---
Idk a subreddit but the way classic works you will fined friends in game. There is also https://www.vanillafriends.com/ to reconnect with old friends.
---
I did. It was absolute trash and any organized team will blow through it anyway
---
Warlocks biggest weakness is they aren‚Äôt mages
---
I did. Challenge from controlling multiple characters. Challenge from their set ups etc. It can be as easy as you want, or you can make it very complicated.

Its impossible to play it alone. Its not retail, you'll make new friends like you *used* to.  Its the spirit of Vanilla.

The rage fest that would ensue..... this would be absolutely hysterical
---
i think in the original beta they worked their way up, increasing the cap every couple of weeks. it makes sense to me to do that. They could turn the raids off if they want to? But i suspect they want to test stuff in there too...

Also drop your blacksmithing hammer. There is no reason to keep one in your bag as you need an anvil anyway, and merchant sells them near anvils.
---
If that's true then that is awesome. Thank you!
---
Because shamans have no way to regenerate mana while casting most guides recommend only casting totems/spells at the start of the fight and then auto-attacking while your mana regens, which means you'll spend the majority of your time relying on auto's so ap/crit is obviously very beneficial.
---
It takes 5 seconds of not casting for your mana regeneration to kick in so if you shock on cd or consistently drop totems/cast mid combat your mana regeneration is negligible, even in ele spec with all int gear you'd still find yourself constantly oom.

It's sarcasm, which many people find funny.. welcome to earth
---
You open on a rogue (or anyone really) = they're dead.
---
Rogue opens on you = they're dead unless they can burn you during the stun or resist your trap.
---
Stoneform is cute but not that OP.
---
thats the shit i love about vanilla wow
---
This is what I'm feeling too. I originally played on a PVP server and it was fun when people were into world PVP, but at least on my realm the release of BG largely killed that off
---
Aside from big PVP raids it means you get ganked farming anything in the world and half your group can enter the instance with damaged gear after doing 2-3 corpse runs to get to the instance.
---
I'm a bit concerned that there isn't going to be any raid guilds on PVE servers, but all there is to go on so far is recruitment threads, of which a good 80-90% are for PVP servers.
---
The original raid frames were atrocious. Most will play with some addon anyway. Since this doesn't really affect gameplay a lot, no one really cares.
---
There's a difference between wanting #NoChanges and nit-picking every minor detail.
---
I don't believe race size affects melee hitbox 
---
I knew there were a lot of clickers (I was one) and it made it easier for you to click, but not range checks.
---
However, regardless, the potion or buff (Like the Deviant Delight) for "code" purposes changes you to that race, but keeps your flag (Tauren Shaman) The same.0

---
That isn't sarcasm, though.
---
if you played 20 hours a day, you could hit that 60 within a month
---
Ok thanks a lot everyone
---
Coulda swore I saw this comment yesterday
---
I played an orc hunter in vanilla and would almost always lise yo a similar geared NE hunter because of their damn dodge racial. Shot for shot that 1 dodged autoshot would cause me to lose every time.
---
Yeah sunken temple that's a long one
---
15 if you are lucky mate, I would get them at 20 if that
---
Dude...
---
Not cool.
---
Look at moneybags here, just buying hammers willy nilly!
---
Can someone explain like im five?
---
Alteralic Valley used to start at lvl51
---
&gt;Is there a stop leveling command in beta?
---
Pretty sure that no, would be too unBlizzlike. You'll have to be careful with getting XP.
---
Revenge for 6-8 years of abuse.
---
At least they were real words
---
The bluepost confirming they chose to go with this version of AV came out March 19.
---
For the Horde!
---
You come off a bit condescending, but I totally get your point. The reason I stopped playing during BC is because I saw how much easier they were making things... To the detriment of the game.
---
u/tremetclassic I have a quick question: where did your database information come from? Is it from Wowhead's database or somewhere else? I've always wondered this.
---
Can‚Äôt you just print it out?
---
Afaik weapon skill doesn't really matter much to hunters (no parry, glancing blows, etc) so you should always aim for the best weapon you can equip.
---
hunters of any race should beat rogues pretty consistently at 60. your trinket breaks stuns and you have multiple ways to knock them out of stealth and reliable resets for bandaging etc. you don't need stoneform.
---
That is a stupid argument.
---
I was wondering why the site was down, good to hear. 
---
I gotta ask, any plans on open sourcing the site?
---
Atleast they don't make noises like the corpses in undercity.
---
Get letherworking, go ungoro, kill Dino's, craft a blue devilsour set.
---
You will wreck face as enh
---
It happened yes, but it's a marginal minority of deranged people, that doesn't really serve any arguments
---
Would be so much paper though
---
I think they'll embrace the challenge, same as we did. You answered your own question with the Dark Souls comment. Those games make Vanilla WoW look like a joke, and yet they've been wildly popular and still have an active online community. 
---
I'm hoping that you're right about the industry, though. If Classic is as successful as I think it will be, the "instant gratification" games industry may have to take a hard look in the mirror. 
---
One can only hope!
---
I've never played a shaman past level 20 but...
---
I thought the D2 set is more for elemental?
---
The pvp gear looks decent for enhancement? I think getting rank 10 for the blue set is somewhat realistic. And you can get it earlier than the D2 stuff.
---
Afaik it has been nerfed two days. In current retail you don't need to jump at all. You can just walk and you drop yo lower platform
---
Why would they be scolding anyone? I liked their post and didn't find it condescending, they even used a :D face.
---
Because blizzard told them not to care. Same reason why you see people defending layering, loot trading, etc.
---
They have not mentioned those class quests specifically. My guess would be phase 1, but don't quote me on that.
---
how do they differ from any addons raid frames like xperl etc. 
---
its a non issue imo
---
Phone or tablet
---
Joana has mentioned that he just hired someone to develop an in-game addon with his guide. Not clear how far along it'll be by classic release, though.
---
Arguably WORSE. I‚Äôd rather my static/white noise remain just that. Nonsense is easier to filter in the chat. I‚Äôm actually looking forward to this now.
---
Just remember that most will want to dps endgame
---
this is awesome, thank you!
---
Thanks for all the comments guys, I understand now.
---
Is there any reason not to macro /startattack to all your melee abilities!? Someone asked me if it toggled auto attack off the other day and I'm not 100% sure since I'm not in beta. I remember doing it back in the day and it not being an issue. In BFA, you don't need to macro it because it's built into the abilities by Blizzard.
---
Anyways, just curious if anyone in beta can 100% confirm.
---
I am just going to enjoy summer. If I'd have beta access it wouldn't be so easy. Now I can enjoy summer and then destroy my life in August
---
Not too bad then, hopefully can drop 5/5 anticipation pretty early then. 
---
Quite liking this spec, myself: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AjPBATAFzxzzE0A
---
Improved Taunt to get down the tree. Could go 2/5 anticipation.
---
Same goes for 3/3 Shieldblock - I think 1 is only really necessary.
---
Improved Charge seems reasonably useful for pulls.
---
Ooooo i need this macro, i assume its bound to any opener and it auto loots right before you come out of stealth?
---
Same lol
---
Anyone remembers running stratholme before lvl60? I want to make a list of wich dungeons to hit at each lvl and stratholme seems hard to clean
---
I remember the warlocks in my guild had a clique going on. We would party up an hour befor the raid to get shards for summons, healthstones, things like that. And then actively try and fuck over people. Either by DKP bid wars (where you bid on an item you didn't want just to make the other person spend all of theirs, and have no more) to summoning people underwater where they drowned.
---
All this was our little payback for being underappreciated.
---
How would this be any different that  gold farmers that Blizzard aggressively blocked?  They were just a bunch of folks grinding and getting gold to sell to other players that skewed the economy.
---
Does anyone know if tauren Druid forms effect  this?
---
True, the fans don't get paid for it the bot farmers did.  Otherwise no difference.
---
Such is life
---
There's not "so many and so strong NPCs" that a forty-toon zerg can't delete them. If people want the BG over with quickly they'll do it.
---
Is this the same streamer that keyboard turns and back pedals?
---
Alchemy is good choice, you can aoe farm dm North for herbs solo, requires holy Nova and shit ton of int gear, but you can do it.
---
Well, I know who I'm summoning underwater now.
---
What if I need more than one word like "Binds when picked up" or "Binds when equipped"? In this case I could use "picked" or "equipped" but in certain cases you might have to be more specific to get the search result you're looking for.
---
Looking forward to !not as well.
---
I think you should try something new.
---
I tried Horde on private server for a change. Was sort of fun, but I still think Hordies are ugly and evil (e.g. WSG is pure Horde aggression, and don't tell me "Thrall was against" - he didn't prevent it, so Horde and its greed are literally the cause of the war).
---
I don't know what to suggest you.
---
Nahh, they won‚Äôt stop playing :D  they‚Äôll play much more than me that‚Äôs the problem
---
Thanks! Hmmm rank 10 isn‚Äôt so casual from what I hear. Would be fine it was just a long grind, but it seems like you really need to invest hours every day even for r10
---
Lol he didn‚Äôt take Kings..
---
Simpler times
---
Best friends for 15 years, I‚Äôll choose them then. Thanks dude
---
Stratholme is one of the harder instances in the game. It's certainly possible to do pre-60 but It'd be tough. Especially since there are a lot of mobs and the increased aggro range would make it even more difficult.
---
My advice, wait till 60. You'll run it plenty of times anyway.
---
The one thing I was most looking forward to in classic was the old AV. I never got to experience it. I feel cheated a little.
---
No body cares because raiders didn't use default raid frames anyway cos they were shit. Everyone used addons instead. Blizzard updating them is basically just a different add-on in some respect.
---
That would imply they have some form of account prioritization built already, which was part of the test. This is actually a little concerning. Not streamers, but what if they roll out some sort of "pay more for better access" scheme?
---
Exactly.  Or having to empty a bag before unequiping to equip new one
---
Nothing to do about it, but we are nearly there!
---
My eyes are having painful flashbacks to the Tron movie.
---
Hey OP. I played vanilla wow (subbed through until end of WoTLK). I also have played on a vanilla private server. I got into the beta... I understand this viewpoint since I have put a lot of time into the beta.  
---
I have to admit I disagree though. There are so many different classes in vanilla that offer extremely unique play styles and experiences, as well as two different factions with completely unique quest lines (until endgame). I feel very lucky to be able to test bugs and have a character now. I've treated my beta character as if I won't be losing it when the game releases. (building professions etc.)  
---
I think levelling 1-30 in Classic WoW is a lot of fun, but I'm excited for August when I can re-roll to the opposite faction and play a new class that I haven't played in vanilla before.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but right now it seems that the search function doesn't work for zones or dungeons.
---
If I look for "deadmines" it doesn't give me the zone as a result. Same goes for "Arathi".
---
There is the "Transformer loosing a boner" sound too !
---
Damn you convinced them ! Good on you, I didn‚Äôt succeed :( 
---
Yeah.. gnome mage are fun but not as badass as undead and you know it ! Haha
---
I love alliance cities, ambiance.. but damn I wanted my ud sooo bad üòÖ
---
The best NA Warrior
---
I love it! It's also nice to see Goldshire from the less popular side. I always thought it was nice how there was those NPCs fishing.
---
Damn, now I want to play the sims lmao
---
yeah i think holy shield is important.
---
I also think spiritual focus is, for leveling.
---
I'd do something like: [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=50500100000000053231330001541050040000000000](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=50500100000000053231330001541050040000000000)
---
getting consecration first, then going down prot.
---
(I actually prefer 20/31/0 so I can do either role. But your call.)
---
Than do it. Its not as strong as ele/resto, but it can be fun regardless. You have to get 2 sets with ele as well. When Alterac is out you have with the Unstoppable Force a pretty easy to obtain weapon that will already produce nice wf crits.
---
wow
---
Why not make a route yourself?
---
Why copy a route not ever player is suited for?
---
thanks for the clear up man.
---
Neckbeards are soo unhealthy.
---
There were probably plenty of young kids who stuck it out and didn‚Äôt complain, and plenty of older gamers who threw tantrums on the forums every day that everything was too hard and they weren‚Äôt being rewarded every time they completed a quest or ran a dungeon.
---
You cant just lump people together because it fits whatever ideologies you have. 
---
The problem is people only being negative, and the negative opinions being the only voice on the forums and social media. If you want to keep the game from being ruined this time, sing it‚Äôs praises everywhere you get a chance to. When you see some negative winey baby bullshit call it out!
---
We need more positive attitudes in this day, and not just in World of Warcraft.
---
The best way to experience vanilla for the first time is to go in completely blind. Don't worry about studying the game before it's even out. Just log in on the 27th of August and play. If you get really stuck on a quest, look it up. Worry about min-maxing at 60, if you care to. Most people who play WoW are casuals so you shouldn't be intimidated by how knowledgeable a select group of diehard weirdos like me are.
---
Vanilla is a lot different to current wow, even in the early levels. Expect to die a lot. Expect to get frustrated and walk away from the computer sometimes. But also expect to feel a genuine sense of reward when you complete that quest that you just died on 5 times.
---
Speaking of capes, that 1st time you equip a full length cape. O thats a sweet moment.
---
Just get R10 and buy the blue gear. R10 is easily achievable by just doing AV a few hours a day.
---
Ur not missing much man, I promise.  The release, the character that won‚Äôt be deleted, how you spend your time after aug 26, that is what matters.
---
Grind out the innkeepers daughter toy from archaeology and you can just delete the hearthstone permanently and just use the toy.  Saves a space on all your chars.
---
You can do less 1button macros that alternate between spells etc in retail. No changing of keybindings, auto taegets and spells etc.
---
If you are used to 1button stuff like healbot - it won't work.
---
You do get more info from the API tho so stuff like dot counters and damage meters are easier/better in the retail API. Most typical macros can be done on both.
---
Id say the new API is way healthier and better for the game even if you don't count the fact that it makes stuff like botting harder.
---
Only ever really played horde, giving alliance a try this time around. That being said, roll a tauren, mulgore is delightful.
---
I'm pretty much a Forsaken at this point.
---
Joana
---
There is one i think, its called vanillaguide and shows joana‚Äòs step by step guide. should be combined with questie to see the location on your map aswell
---
You and me both. The only thing I recognize in the whole thing is `kappa`.
---
You never know who you'll make friends with in vanilla. You might have some people come up to you and say nothing, you might have some that say a lot more, smile, and bam that's your crew now.
---
plus redoubt (via sanc/holy shield/spike/etc) and reckoning generate more threat. crit me as much as you can!
---
This.
---
There is literally nothing in any version of AV that will stop an organised forty-person team steamrolling straight to the end, except other players. If both teams want to zerg for the boss and ignore the other raid, that is what will happen.
---
If you want the mythical endless AVs back you can't get that outcome just by rolling AV back to 1.5. You have to change player behaviour to stop them zerging for the finish line and make them fight the other team, somehow.
---
But that was the whole point of the NPCs, they force your zerg to dismount and deal with them. Which means the defense then organizes ahead of the zerg and it's a zerg v zerg battle instead of zerg v zerg runby.
---
A solo player who tried to mount past the towers with the multitude of high level archers would just get killed on the way. Even if a whole zerg tried to do that, a lot of them would die on the way, more would be dazed and dismounted by the melee patrols and their pets that saw through stealth.
---
By the end of the long run, out of 40 you could have 10 reach the final GY only to meet the elite guards and all of the vendors and NPCs in the base. That's if no one bothered to defend at any of the choke points at all. A single frostnova under a bunker/turret would have most of the people novaed dead if they tried to stay mounted and wait out the root.
---
Lot of the mobs were elite, they were a ton more of them than after the nerf. Even stealthers would have it quite hard to get around.
---
Aaaaaaaand this is why we need RP-pvp servers.
---
i hope so! i‚Äôm pretty terrible at games even though i enjoy them so i‚Äôm just worried that nobody will talk to me /:
---
How about specifically macros? What are some of the most complex macros people are using out of retail?
---
No it's not quite like that.
---
Especially considering escape artist is a 1 or 1.5 min cooldown, and stoneform is a 2.
---
RemindMe! 80 Days
---
Try something new!
---
that armour set is 90% of why people choose to play pala
---
Classic
---
It's funny because on Malygos back in the day we did use "VC" in the first half year of the game, but now I just use it because I know it pisses people off
---
I think stoneform's overrated because of it's 3 minute cooldown.
---
It's pretty swell, but not something I'm gonna consider a game changer, unless maybe your a dwarf rogue?
---
The only other point in being dwarf is to purge poisons.
---
But I think it‚Äôs a tough choice between the two.
---
Also, nelf imo has the best design and the females are really fun to pilot around with their tuck jump.
---
I think female nelf hunter wins.
---
Isn't that some kind of japanese turtle monster?
---
The past is in black and white. Are you retarded?
---
No probably not. People have insisted "x game will end WoW" for like 15 years now
---
Private server players aren‚Äôt going in blind... So far they‚Äôre more shocked at how much easier dungeons are on the beta.
---
Jesus you went fucking forever without Bulwark dropping. I'd be pissed.
---
No idea what was happening on my screen then xD
---
Nah don't worry, us alliance actually call it dm because it's the first dungeon we do and we didn't know about dire maul at the time. This vc thing is server by server, and predominantly horde.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat deciding between the two
---

---
I thought /4 was global initially, no?
---
Has it not occurred to anyone that if EVERYONE is using Joana's guide then ALL of the zones on release are going to be super fucking crowded and you won't get any quest items/kills.
---
you sound like a 12yr old timetraveller from 2004
---
Doesn't seem to be a secret around here. Maybe itll be different come game time when someone is desperate for a healer
---
I haven‚Äôt played since MoP. I subbed 2 days before the beta and I still got in.
---
Haha same, I think I'm pretty bad. What do you plan on rolling?
---
Hi, /u/3E_
---
If you want a little bit more active playstyle I recommend wearing gear with spirit so you regen more mana. Spirit is a good stat for shaman, on par with strength and agility for leveling efficiency if you maximize time spent outside the five second rule by using mana in bursts. Even with plenty of spirit the optimal rotation on each mob will pretty much be Flame Shock pull -&gt; Searing Totem -&gt; Lightning Shield -&gt; Auto attack until dead.
---
&gt;Why are Retail raid frames not a bigger issue?
---
Because raid frames have always been a core feature in Vanilla.
---
Does anyone know how much gold you‚Äôd make from vendoring leather from 1-60?
---
thank you for a respone that's relevant to my question
---
That would be best for cases where the healer is not needed for a whole fight.  
---
I think the DPS would be not much less than a standard feral DPS
---
You know, I don't really remember. I got rank 10 on a few characters and I had a job and whatnot. But I did play more than is healthy. I think try it out and see if it works? Some of the pieces from that set come at lower ranks, too -- I'm sure you can get some of them.
---
The reputation battleground gear is good - that is a long but at-your-own-pace grind.
---
I don't know, just an idea.
---
Imagine that bad boy with a BoK instead of that BoM... those +10% hp would be sick!!
---
thank you for a response that's relevant to my question!
---
It's a letter, too. It's quite a lot of things, tbh.
---
The gold farmers aren‚Äôt banned because they farm gold. They‚Äôre banned because they sell gold. So it‚Äôs actually nothing like this.
---
It's called "saying "it's called" two too many times".
---
*insert we don't do that here meme*
---
You're in r/classicwow. In Vanilla, "toys" were using a slot in your bag. Also, I don't think archeology was implemented until Cata
---
Have you told them you want to play it really badly?? they played horde and really shouldn't have an issue going horde but i guess majority rules at the end of the day
---
That one I am not sure on, sorry man.
---
not sure i can afford a tablet and my phone screen isn't big enough for me to just look and read quickly. i'll have to zoom.
---
Nice, thanks. Im aware its not easy to gear, but got 2 friends to make a crafting trifecta with, we will manage!
---
I wasn't saying it was my hate. I was saying it was a general sort of hate.
---
jesus calm your tits.
---
It has been explained many, many times why some people call deadmines VC.
---
* Horde players never really got exposed to it so to them DM was dire maul.
---
* The quest line that takes you there asks for the head of Van Cleef, people went there for that quest, hence looking for group \*for\* van cleef "VC"
---
* Players who started after DM was released were "born" into a world where there were two dungeons abbreviated "DM".  One you did once or twice as a low level, one you farmed for relentlessly for gold and pre-bis gear.
---
Both DM and VC are acceptable, neither is right or wrong.
---
Thousands of other players have done the same and the beta is only open to hundreds.
---
No reason to be so entitled..
---
Because i want to get to max level as efficiently as possible with minimum downtime
---
Is that supposed to be Kraven next to Rhino?
---
On the beta it is but it wasn't particularly popular on any pserver or back in retail vanilla. I think we're seeing beta-specific anomalies related to the fact that the level cap was 30 for a long time, giving shamans a huge edge since enhancement is artificially overpowered at that level.
---
I‚Äôd never played on a PvP realm till a year ago and I wouldn‚Äôt go back. What sounds like a pain i.e. ganking etc is actually a lot of fun.
---
Wow, that was quite a dose of wisdom early on this Sunday morning
---
Pretty sure every server called it VC back in the day. At least mine did.
---
The more likely case is everyone got better gear and learned the dungeons.
---
&gt; But that was the whole point of the NPCs, they force your zerg to dismount and deal with them. Which means the defense then organizes ahead of the zerg and it's a zerg v zerg battle instead of zerg v zerg runby.
---
Well no, in the modern meta the defence *doesn't* do that. That is the whole point. Both sides know that they maximise their rewards per hour by not fighting the other side. Unless that changes, their behaviour won't change. Why would it?
---
&gt; A solo player who tried to mount past the towers with the multitude of high level archers would just get killed on the way. Even if a whole zerg tried to do that, a lot of them would die on the way, more would be dazed and dismounted by the melee patrols and their pets that saw through stealth.
---
Stopping to kill these NPCs doesn't take all that long, so you're talking about adding minutes to the total zerg time. None of that matters unless there are actual incentives for both sides to try to drag the game out longer.
---
&gt; By the end of the long run, out of 40 you could have 10 reach the final GY
---
Then obviously we won't do that then.
---
The only thing that will stop people playing AV as a PvE zerg race is if the game no longer rewards that. The pre-nerf version does not give any greater reward fighting the other team so far as I am aware, it just has more trash to clear to get to the end.
---
any chance of a version without the dots and zone levels?
---
This looks like it could be a course on GolfIt
---
And one of them was named Jason and the lake was crystal lake.
---
Nah, played vanilla. Mages need 2 groups tops for decursing Luci, Gehennas, and Shazz.
---
Bareon on Youtube is good
---
Does anyone know if Seal of Command can crit if the melee swing doesn't, and vice versa?
---
Not playing the beta gets me more hyped to play the game. 
---
Few more months to go man.
---
Grats
---
/s or /1 in a pinch.
---
Thanks for this. I've had your spreadsheet bookmarked for a while now. It will be frequently visited when Classic launches! :)
---
I got a tip as well for y'all. If you put [/htmlview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/htmlview) instead of `/edit` you get a lightweight version. Tooltips don't work but it's hell of a lot faster.
---
You might want to add which region your guild is operating in

That was definitely not emphatic or shouty, but okay Eminem.
---
Thanks! I took a few Screenshots, ofc from the most popular angle too, but this one kinda spoke to me the most ü§ó im glad you like it too!!
---
He keeps his good shoulders in the safe..
---
I'm glad I didn't get in, but I'm not watching streamers or vids.  Why bother? I know the game inside and outside. If I want to watch a narcissist play vanilla, I'll load up a pserver and put a mirror above my monitor.
---
lol @ people who didn't even play the game trying to say it wasn't called VC
---
You likely can't. But if they have AotC you can always shoot them to daze.
---
What I did when I was going for HoJ was like "LF2M BRD, HoJ reserved" and then put it on master looter a few pulls before the boss that dropped it. Worked pretty well with minimal rude whispers.
---
Why is that?  Are there no streamers in the EU or are they not allowed to do so?
---
Same on Mannoroth, this sub has a weird boner for rewriting history
---
Thank you. :)
---
Yes, I played combat/prot tank in vanilla and we were running strat starting at about 57-58. I don't recall strat being difficult at all.
---
Just hope that Blizzard will at least allow no or very low cost server transfers for players who find out they're on a *streamer* server and want to move their character elsewhere.
---
Alt-tab is likely faster. I think there used to be an ingame browser addon which might make it even easier.
---
Is there a hard rule on how % increases stack ? For instance, does the troll racial [Beast Slaying](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20557) stack with the rogue Assassination talent [Murder](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=14159) ?
---
why are you pretty sure of that. Mine didn't
---
Actively trying to fuck over people you‚Äôre supposed to be helping sounds like a dick move.
---
Damn. I've totally forgotten what the old Hunter's Mark looked like.
---
I did that on my rogue lol.
---
WHy do you feel entitled for B√©ta just because you played since TBC?
---
B√©ta invite and subscription duration has no correlation so suck it up princess.
---
Thats the problem, I really would like to share the URL redirecting to the html version of the document but it contains so much notes that people would miss out on A LOT of explanation. :/
---
Check Joana's 1-60 leveling, he equips a new bag without emptying the old one in patch 1.9.2.
---
Being overgeared if 1v1. Playing with team if not.
---
That's like saying that a crack den is your home.  Although I might choose the crack den.
---
Reporting of gold farming bots that used to run around in circles in some areas got those bots removed.
---
Exactly what \_Yellow is saying.  
---
Front load your mana usage on a mob, and then just auto attack. At early levels that means 1-2 LBs, an earth shock then melee. Later it will be totems and a flame shock. You can do a similar thing as warrior hamstring kiting, but by using your earthbind totem. So that will save your HP quite a bit.
---
Having a couple INT pieces isnt the worst thing in the world, but I wouldnt actively go for it.
---
You could fail. It would just say "Failed Attempt" and you'd have to click the herb/mining node again.
---
I‚Äôve got a small group of about 10 friends planning on playing. We are going to play alliance on a pvp server. You are welcome to join us! I‚Äôve got a Facebook group made for discussion and hype too. Most of us played classic and would be more than happy to help and answer questions!
---
Uh... Tips?
---
&gt; A lot less magic commands like the one for seeing nameplates from super far (tho this is available in beta so not sure there).
---
It was changed. Nameplates are a fixed distance like they were in vanilla now.
---
1.5 AV would require rebuilding the zone from scratch because they (claim) they don't have any data from before 1.12.
---
Whenever they have had to choose between saving money and spending money, saving money has won, regardless.
---
In a perfect world, we'd get both AVs (say, 1.12av normally, and 1.5av on "av" weekends) but that would cost money.  We're not getting real customer service. We're not getting real servers. We're not getting an authentic client. We're not getting 1.5av.
---
Stamina and int is only really needed in pvp. What you want is spirit, str/agi. If you expect pvp then int is extremely important.
---
it's tough. if you taunt the pet it might break the trap for you (depending on how he has it set). I don't know what level you are, but for sure you need intercept. Piercing howl is good if you "almost caught him". Probably engineering helps (daze him with a grenade to buy time to close).
---
(It might be that berzerker rage breaks scatter shot? I don't remember.)
---
If you're just getting beat on for a while, you can swap your shield on and/or D stance to reduce the damage (e.g. until intercept cools down).
---
good luck!
---
I think most of the launch servers did, but of course not all.  The reason was because the dungeons were still very much an unknown to a lot of people.  I know I didn't go to Deadmines/VC until I was like 24 because I had no idea what it was and most people didn't know what to call it so they just called it by the main boss.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=world+of+warcraft+macros
---
Darn good memory!
---
in that note: only WoW could end Wow, am I right? lol
---
It was definitely VC to a lot of us on Windrunner.
---
Yeah it gives that fantasy vibe because of the lake and the forest being so close. :)
---
Yea they are super convinced they can get WF
---
Thanks, added that in.
---
LoS is your friend as a warrior. You cannot chase down a huntard. They're built to kite so make them come to you.
---
Don't expect to win duels and if you're in a group pvp environment try not to go alone.
---
I found in vanilla I probably spent the most time in the gy but when I got that sweet rez I was ready to tear anything down!
---
With a coordinated and knowledgeable group, the sky is the limit! :D
---
Just wait for release? Is it that hard?
---
There are hundreds of threads on how tauren hits from 2yd further which is what he is asking about.
---
yea, they can coexist.. 2 different games basically
---
*Applaudes you in retribution*
---
If you're leveling through questing you have to do like 80% of quests anyway, the guide just tells you in which specific order.
---
You could always just check their level. Not hard to work out when a level 19 types 'LFG DM' they mean Deadmines. Plus people would specify which part of Dire Maul they wanted to do anyway.
---
We get it, you hate Twitch.
---
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to be anyway.

I have now implemented a prototype of Regexp search blocs

I wrote "beta testers were prioritized while stress testers were not", there is no implication here. accounts that are chosen for beta testing are prioritized over accounts that were chosen for stress testing. it's not concerning,  you're just stirring up nonsense, lol
---
They can do raid testing in-house and with the f&amp;f testers. Repeat runs, no lockouts.
---
They don‚Äôt *need* to put it out there for months of streaming.

---
I played I had never heard of DM being called VC before until the classic beta. I have never seen it once on european realms, must be an american thing.
---
Oh I'm perfectly fine with slower leveling. I don't remember much about Vanilla since It's been so long and I never played private servers so I'm going to be reading all the quests I do. I love story and lore. Not in any rush
---
dwarf is the defensive choice, but picking nelf means you get some of that roguey goodness for yourself - and still have the hunter's incredible kit vs rogues
---
Because just like in retail most people will be using raid frame mods anyways.
---
Dishonorable kills only come from certain NPCs, but not low level players.
---
Here's the commentary for the trailer if anyone wants to hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foIwQHVt-kw

Affirmative.

No wonder they felt ‚Äúunder appreciated‚Äù.

TRUE LULW
---
Same. Played vanilla on Horde US and everyone I knew called it DM
---
That's what I hope. But the enthusiasm seen here and other forums may or may not result in what we hope for. Only time will tell. 
---
Some work will need tone done for expansions, hopefully the Classic theme. Most people will only replay something for a limited number of times.
---
you separate the search parameters with comma , it could look like this: bindswhenequipped, stamina, armor

Potential PSA: Using the Stuck feature would Hearthstone you home during Vanilla if your Hearthstone was off cooldown, even if your hearthstone was in a Bank.
---
This! I hope I can join one. It will be so much fun
---
Yeah, more or less. I started playing after the Dire Maul patch, and I was told something like, "We call it VC to avoid confusion if spamming in trade or something, but if you're lfg in Westfall general either one works."
---
Ok. So now the streamers are deploying bots in this scenario?
---
It was VC because DM was Dire Maul. Then again I played Horde, so I rarely saw it in chat until TBC.
---
\+1 Fire res
---
His aliance routes are worse than his horde ones. Leveled a troll and a gnome with them and the diff is obvious.
---
Also there are quests that should be skipped if a lot of people are farming them yet he doesnt mention it (this bit is also a bit better on the hordr side).
---
Still best i know for a general path tho but there might be better ones.
---
Can confirm it was VC on mannoroth for Vanilla.
---
You are totally right.
---
IMO Vanilla Wow and actual retail Wow are two completely different games. For instance Vanilla is less about besting dps stats or rushing (though you CAN seek that) than taking your hard time traveling and questing, finding some good friends to go in dungeons and found/join a guild. 
---
You gotta master your crafting and cooking skills because they are definitely mandatory to ease your way. And you will read your quests log, because there will be no magic spots on your map to know where to go. Sometimes you will have to carry a book that you will have to read to know how to complete your quest. Sometimes you will even have to go to your hometown library to ask for a book to help you. And you will save your golds and spend them wisely, because you CAN and WILL be broke in WoW, especially around the lvl 40+.
---
Vanilla Wow is "playing the hard way". It is frustrating sometimes, but way more rewarding in the end. 
---
It took me a year to reach the level 60 with my first character, playing maybe one or two hours a day. So it kind of made sense when Illidan told us we were not ready ^_^
---
I guess it is not for anybody, and I hope I won't see too much fortniters yelling and stealing unsuitable stuff when Classic will come out.
---
If you didn't even know what it was for so long, how would you know the name of the main boss before knowing the name of the damn instance itself? That's so counter-intuitive.
---
It's past the point of no return. Too many changes make the game a totally different experience. It would be jarring to do a 180 on their game design philosophy
---
Instructions unclear. Arrived at pornhub
---
I second this.  
---
I am now playing *a superb game* named Satisfactory that has resources/poi all over a larg*(ish)* map and always used a fan "map site" that was the best looking *(in my opinion)*. But then they released a content update patch and changed where resources were located and suddenly I had to change to a larger but a lot less appealing site because they updated their data immediately.  
---
I'm just saying, it is enough to have a few things "wrong" for people to switch to get the most updated content.
---
I played alliance all the way into cata and I really enjoyed horde on private servers. They have way more quests, better pvp racials, and wind fury totem adds completely new mechanics to the raid making 2 handed fury viable. 
---
Dungeonwise, horde have an easier time getting to most instances early levels, but black rock mountain  is pretty inconvenient for travel.
---
Defcamp
---
Man you have no idea how lucky you are. Best thing you have going for you is not having experienced the whole game yet!
---
Cherish your time leveling, try not to worry about playing a correct class/race combo, don‚Äôt worry too much about specing your character according to internet guides. Don‚Äôt worry that you are not questing or grinding in the most optimal zone. 
---
The magic of this game is getting to discover the world on your own and learn through all of the experiences you have!
---
Most of us who have already had all of these experiences and can never go back to the first time running across the thandol span, or grouping up and meeting friends or the first time we experienced a large scale world pvp battle.
---
Sorry this got a little lengthy but honestly you have a golden ticket, don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúget ready‚Äù for the game. Wait until classic releases to play. You will be happy you did I promise!
---
So not only are you calling people retarded, you're literally playing the alliance vs horde fantasy on Reddit. I think you're the one who's growth was retarded at some point, you're acting like a 14 year old
---
You need to save your Charge/Intercept as best as you can for AFTER he uses his skills to get away from you. 
---
Get Engineering as well. Those items will help.
---
I definitely have told them, as they ¬´¬†decide¬†¬ª because they‚Äôll play way more than me. That‚Äôs why I was still hesitating between going horde alone or alliance with my friends.
---
I like the people on horde more generally.
---
Is there a list for the system specs anywhere? Tried googling without any clear results. 
---
I just have a basic HP Envy laptop from a couple years ago. Assuming it will be fine since I ran the game back in high school on my ‚Äò05 desktop so a 10 year newer laptop should be fine right? Haven‚Äôt played any PC games since WoW in ‚Äò06

---
I'm wondering about this, myself...
---
PvP on PServers is a bit different because a chunk of players may not really be into PvP and are just on the server because there was no other option, and in Classic a bunch will transfer to PvE servers.
---
On the other hand, Vanilla seems to have been balanced around PvP in addition to PvE in many ways.
---
Scatter trap doesnt give chance to taunt.
---
The nameplates change was possible in vanilla but not many knew it. I guess it was changed to be like retail, you mean.
---
raid frames aka Addons where also in Vanilla.
---
Deadmines was way before Dire Maul. And if you were looking for a dire maul group you would say 
---
DM:E, etc..
---
I am now playing *a superb game* named Satisfactory that has resources/poi all over a large*(ish)* map and always used a fan "map site" that was the best looking *(in my opinion)*.

---
So... block him?
---
Insert *whoosh* meme here
---
I think on private servers they were very popular aswell, 3rd or 4th most played on horde
---
This guy knows what's up
---
Oh no..It's retarded.
---
But the guide has you going to certain zones and not others.  People blindly follow it, everyone will be in the same 1-30 path instead of seeing the other 2 options.
---
Just play on a Pserver if you absolutely have to try it out.
---
and what consumables do i have to get away from rogues poisons and shit.
---
since there is no indication that streamers will have benefit at launch i am not worried  
---
Also i will try to claim alot of streamer names....
---
Cursing and capitalizing words come across as pretty hostile in text. 
---
I know what you're saying though. All the leveling routes will be a congested mess without dynamic respawns.
---
US Bonechewer alliance called it VC since at least early TBC when I started playing
---
Oh the suppression room.  When rogues were important.
---
You were beta all along.
---
The guy ok the right is the only horde player
---
People understand why it's sometimes called VC. I never had any issues with knowing what instance the group was for, Deadmines were always just "DM", Dire Maul was often "DMX", with X being what DM, east, west..
---
A simple shift click to find out the level of the leader solves any confusion.
---
No, i am right and everyone else saying differently is wrong. What is up with you mate?
---
Its not ¬´their names¬ª.
---
That vanilla community feel
---
Howww?
---
It‚Äôs understandable blizzard should give prioritization to say thanks for testing our game and losing your beta characters.
---
the point was that classic is not vanilla, not if you or anyone will enjoy it or not.
---
no matter how many downvotes the statement will get:
---
CLASSIC IS NOT VANILLA
---
:)
---
This is why a lot of guilds abandoned pure DKP. If you're going to use DKP, bidding has to have a cost. Modified DKPs, such as a system where if you win a bid you lose all your DKP anyway, or double-blind single-bid auctions, are much more common than raw DKP.
---
Man I feel the people in during that time really had the ability to participate, now I see a lot of timidness or people just say they wanna log off.
---
It went all the way up the last point and stopped, something like 649,999/650,000.  Before the launch of TBC, I hoped the EXP bars wouldn't reset so I would level up to 61 by walking through the Dark Portal.
---
They reset =/
---
Most people who raided seriously had mods for raid frames anyway. I expect a lot of the nonVanilla portions to be fixed by modders.
---
what does pst mean?
---
How was it possible? The cVar wasn't even available in the 1.12.1 client.
---
I would love an RP PvP realm. Less stupid names, less ragers, more freedom to explore ‚Äúsub optimal‚Äù builds, more immersive.. and less sharding. I know blizzard has stated that they only intend to shard at launch but I really don‚Äôt expect them to keep their word on that. But even on retail realms, they don‚Äôt shard the RP realms like they do the normal ones because it fucks up player driven events so I am confident they won‚Äôt do it to classic RP realms for the same reason.
---
I remember going to loch Modan at level 10/11(?), can‚Äôt remember which level triggers the quest, as a warrior because there was a level 16 quest that was doable in a group that rewarded basic white shoulders of Mail quality, which was huge for me at the time cause going on wowhead the next available mail shoulder pieces available wasn‚Äôt until RRD or so which meant you had to take lower armor pieces like leather or cloth in the mean time

First shoulders and green iron helm as a warrior, oh man
---
I've played both sides. Alliance in Vanilla and Horde for everything else up to BFA where I switched back to Alliance.
---
I find Horde have a better community and I enjoy their quests far more as you progress because they stop being the "evil" faction and start to show more depth in their story and it isn't as cut and dry as they're the "bad guys".
---
Sorry, we meant ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùbest‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù NA Warrior

This was really early on in vanilla so we didn't have much of a choice haha, just a lot of trial and error

Additionally, lets add free heirloom gear for all of us working dads who don't have the time to level. Also level 10 flying mounts so we can get to where we need to be quicker.
---
Huehue I acted like a moron and you called me out on it so now you‚Äôre the moron
---
A Macro Sticky containing some popular (or downright necessary) macros for each class would be nice.

Yeah it just stayed there, you could disable it with addons such as bartender. Or you could track reputation with it, and it would replace it with a yellow or green bar xp bar.
---
I'll see you In stv, prepare to be ganked
---
Playing music is the worst.
---
Wouldn't you want to drop 2 points in 1h spec to max out toughness? IIRC 1h spec only increased the damage from your weapon. The majority of your damage will come from spells, and the actual damage of a spell caster weapon is quite low.
---
Druids will have higher armor and hp the whole time.   Warriors cannot catch up.
---
They surpass druids on avoidance and cooldowns though.
---
This meme is killing me
---
"Please send tell" same idea as "/w me" or "whisper"
---
You honestly don‚Äôt beat anything in world PvP as a solo warrior.  It‚Äôs literally the worst solo world PvP class in the game by far.  Hunters and mages especially.  There is no way to prevent either from kiting you into oblivion.
---
Luckily for warriors your S Tier for every other facet of the game.  All you need is a healer friend to duo with in world PvP and you go from F tier to S tier there also.
---
&gt; Id say the new API is way healthier and better for the game even if you don't count the fact that it makes stuff like botting harder.
---
I dont think anyone could honestly dispute this
---
Blizz has to make business decisions. Would you promote the game in the same manor as the streamers?
---
They've invited a mixed bunch... some will bug test and some will promote. 
---
Decisions are not about a single person but the goals of the product.
---
Depends on how much you identify with the Alliance. As a Horde player I had a hard time when I went Alliance on a pserver, as much as I love Dwarfs (best race pre-Cata) I just couldn‚Äôt stand the blandness of the rest of the faction. I also prefer the generic attitude of Horde players, they are more toxic (which can be quite entertaining sometimes) but also more tryhard. Also no Blood Elves is a huge plus for the Horde in Classic, that race is the biggest fucking retard magnet in the game.
---
Was called VC on my realm in vanilla
---
If you actually use pog and poggers and monkas then you are an idiot and you should feel bad. I am in the beta and was in asmongold's guild for 4 days. I left that guild because every other freaking sentence in guild chat was pog this and poggers that. Just stop it.
---
Btw I'm betting people will reply using those words. Find a better way to troll.
---
Please send tell (whisper me)
---
This makes me feel old and out of touch lol
---
Pve av was so much fun because it wasn't only pvp. There were unique circumstances that would necessitate unique adaptations of applied skills in order to eek out a win in one of the many small wars.
---
Someone should make a blacklist addon to blacklist people who call Deadmines VC
---
Do people think that these whine posts are actually going to give them beta? I don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre for exactly. These posts should be deleted.
---
You open with charge, getting this off is important. Then you have to dps the hunter as much as possible while chain taunting the pet he can't scatter trap. Eventually he will get trap off though.
---
If he moves to 41 yards, you are gonna have a tough time if he knows how to kite and never get in range. You can LoS and fight the pet, or if his pet is on the way to you, you can max range intercept the pet and then hopefully be in range of the hunter to fear.
---
Only if you plan on using axes all the time.
---
I'm aiming for Quel Serrar and Thunderfury so Troll is the better choice.
---
I‚Äôm just thinking the early content should be really  easy for druid tanks  because they are just a big stat stick
---
Can somebody explain to me where this notion comes from, that simply camping/killing = stream sniping?
---
It's probably because most people on this sub only watched one heavily edited video that didn't show the whole context of what sodapoppin said on his stream but he explained multiple times where the difference is between stream sniping and regular pvp. Here's one example: 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TastyWrongBaconNotATK
---
If you watch the whole vod you can even hear him encouraging things like camping because to him it is one of the those shenanigans that made the community more involved in world pvp and Classic in general.
---
Everybody's already jumped in ya butthole for being in the wrong sub so I won't pile on there, but...  
---
"Grind out the inkeeper's daughter?" Really? I mean that is pretty much how the old joke goes.
---
Shadowmeld is arguably superior to stoneform for PvP and many serious hunter PvPers prefer it. 
---
Any time you are defending a position rather than attacking it gives you a significant advantage. Any time you are out of combat, such as after using feign death, it can be used to interrupt casts. Let's say a hunter is running a flag in WSG and a mage tries to polymorph him. Feign death interrupts the first cast, and then shadowmeld interrupts the second. There's a good chance the mage is now out of range and out of luck. Similarly can be used to prevent shatter combos.
---
Shadowmeld can also be used to force ranged players to come to you (and walk right into your freezing trap). Let's say you're capping a flag in AB but someone is riding on up and about to interrupt the cap. Freezing Trap + Shadowmeld and chances are they'll ride right on up to where you where you were, get trapped, and watch helplessly as you cap the flag.
---
Good luck, Druids don't get ganked. They are king of world PvP.
---
Mage has a few different specs that are good in different situations, not just full fire or frost or whatever. There are frost/fire builds for PvP, and arcane builds for both PvE and PvP. 
---
Warriors has one PvP tree, one DPS tree, and one Tank tree. 
---
As far as I know there are a bunch of different rogue specs that work in different situations, although combat is the obvious go-to for PvE. 
---
Warlocks have a bunch of different spec combination that works depending on what you want to do. Priest has shadow for PvP dps and a few different variations for healing. 
---
Etc. 
---
Most trees where useful situationally. I think even some kind of balance build is still doable for PvP, no?
---
While levelling, sure, a lot of specs are just really bad (prot warrior or balance druid for example).
---
Neither of them are hard, you guys need to play more Super Mario
---
Why did i read hooray in a gnome male voice?
---
I think people are finally realizing after watching beta streams that classic is not the same game as vanilla, and #nochanges is simply not possible. So forcing the developers to build in crappy features versus working on gameplay bugs is just silly.
---
&gt;People wherent retarded back then
---
Anytime you have an option to roll Troll, go Troll.

The most boring and dumbest looking race or a bunch of stoners who are not even capable of wearing shoes, a tough choice indeed.

I would imagine most of the time it happens people have no idea when to jump. Due to the change in elevations its hard to calculate at what point you need to jump, so many would try to make it as close as possible - resulting in jumping too late (so, not at all). Or people think there is no real chance of falling though, so they jump way too early / not at all.
---
My man!
---
What class/faction will you be playing ?
---
Its not classic too. Still, quality rage :D
---
Mobile gaming exists yet you want to bring up quality... quality has nothing to do with the fact that there is more competition today.
---
I, for one, was extremely happy with the changes they made to AV. I know some people had all the time in the world to sit in a BG for 15 hours but I sure didn't and definitely do not now.
---
I'll be avoiding STV like a leper. So many other area with less competition from both factions to level in.
---
Unless it's for the Fishing Tournament
---
Just saying, try not showing gaming keys publicly, not only for you but it might break some Tos in regard to account sharing.
---
This is just such a bad mentality to have. Nobody ultimatley "wins" Tarren Mill skirmishes. They just break out and it's fun. Participate in AV for as long as it's fun for you. It's like a huge tarren mill map but with a population cap so coordination is more important than raw numbers.
---
I agree AV needs changes to make it more evocative of this mentality. The capture point system can be frustrating to deal with because of rogues and people put into situations where they're just standing around guarding a tower when they want to be part of the action.
---
But don't fall into the trap of "I need to win every activity", because you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. Enjoy the act of playing, not just the results.

S tier for any other element of the game?
---
Besides wpvp warrior is utter shit in duels too. Also pretty meh in casual bgs.
---
Only excelling in premade bg with Pocket healer.
---
Pve is another story ofc. But this thread seems pvp focused
---
They definately can tank, no issues, but the healer will have to be a bit more active, from memory.
---
Although I was outgearing  dungeons before 1.12.  So might not be the best recollection.
---
Whats going to feel worse? Levelling without your buds as horde or levelling with them but not being horde ud? Id weigh that up and if you chose horde will that affect your RL relationship with them?
---
Some silver
---
I will look into Hydras stream. Thanks for your suggestion!
---
&gt; But the guide has you going to certain zones and not others 
---
examples? the only areas I saw "skipped" were other starting areas for the wrong race
---
You don't need to wear shoes when the bottom of your feet are so hard they can stop a steel blade.
---
Alexensual is cool.
---
Yes, if you have the time alts are worth.
---
*get a rope!*
---
These are wotlk era memes.   
---
HERESY!
---
Lol it would only be right
---
Rogues aren't intimidating in Classic. At least not to me.
---
That's the coolest thing. I hope whatever guild I wind up in during classic does this
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us
---
Yes it does? You taunt before you get scattered/trapped
---
Unethical life pro tip

Or even a second 24" monitor. No alt-tabbing, and you can pick up an HDMI monitor for ~$50 from an office sale.

It's all about that wpvp.

Won't ever understand "X has more people playing this class/race, so I don't want to roll that"
---
Pick a faction and then the end :)
---
You can put the game in windowed and pull 1 window to the right and 1 to the left.
---
Sorry brother... for the Horde! You‚Äôll find yourself a great guild, though. Everyone wants a clothadin!
---
I've been doing it since I got the game the 29th of October 2005 cause my sister taught it to me. (I can misremember this, the human memory is a non-perfect storage device) and I've been playing the game consistently since, never been warned about it or anything. Stopped it when I got the halloween hearthstone last year
---
It may influence future expansions depending on the success, but they would have to scrap soooo much of what they've done since wotlk to really get people who are coming back to classic interested again.
---
How many 'famous' streamers will get a name reservation?  
---
How many of those have name common enough that another guy somewhere have had the same name for years to actually care?
---
What are the odds that this person will play on the same server?  
---
Answer: almost none  
---
It's just being so bitter and jealous over nothing
---
Will be playing a druid starting on the alliance side. What about you?
---
I was replying to the post where a group of followers is told to basically disrupt the economy and they mindless follow the orders.  So yes, you could say they are deploying bots.
---
DM me if you‚Äôre looking for a horde guild to join!
---
If you are going fury warrior then playing with a healer is perfect, you can 2man DME and make almost as much money as any other class can. 
---
As for whether farming char is worth, you have to look at how many hours it takes to level, and how many hours it takes to make that money back. Say you spend 100 hours to level a char, that in return makes 70g/hour instead of 50g, then you have to farm about 15.000 gold on the alt character to make up for the 100 hours you spend leveling the alt.
---
You think it‚Äôs that simple to make a route 1-60? Just sit down 5 mins and good to go?
---
Now this is a crossver I was not expecting. Just finished episode 2.
---
Best part is, you typically don't :) classes aren't all the same around these parts.
---
Orc / tauren are the only acceptable choices for warrior on horde.
---
It won't be on the original vanilla client (I think I've seen legion mentioned, but someone may correct me on that), so its going to have higher system requirements than 15 years ago.  That said, WoW is a pretty easy game to run, not needing a dedicated GPU for low settings.
---
You can skin harpies...?
---
Full 60 before release Imo. Gotta test everything
---
You‚Äôre only helping my argument.

‚ÄúI beat Molten Core, which means I beat WoW, time to uninstall and play some Pok√©mon Go.‚Äù

Hope you make it past new year's bud.

I don‚Äôt know man I agree with you that a lot of this generation of kids is used to easy mode on mainstream games. But, you are taking this stance that this younger generation is going to forsake the game as a whole because they are all a bunch of cry baby snowflakes. 
---
I‚Äôm just trying to say EVERYONE who is a younger gamer is not going to wine about the difficulty of classic, some will embrace it. EVERYONE who played vanilla will not come back to classic and enjoy it, and will go onto the forums and complain like they did back in the day. It‚Äôs not going to be as simple as drawing a line in the sand and lumping everyone on one side or the other.
---
I don‚Äôt think the right thing to do is play ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if this generation can hack it.‚Äù If you want the game to be successful I think we gotta take an active stance against people who just have a negative attitude because they don‚Äôt have time to raid but are jealous of hardcore raiders running around in tier sets. 
---
Didn‚Äôt mean for this to become a rant, and I‚Äôm genuinely trying to be constructive, not throw shade on your post. What are your thoughts?
---
Tauren are the best race, yep. Enjoy
---
If you don't know what race/faction you're playing but at the same time thinking you're gonna get a thunderfury, I've got a bridge in Oklahoma to sell you.
---
The warrior is probably the hardest and slowest to level out of all the classes in my opinion and with that it‚Äôs going to be the slowest at farming gold.  It will help if you roll a tank spec because you can easily find groups for dungeons. 
---
I would recommend a mage so you could AOE farm mobs with ease.  I would also suggest farming nodes and using the AH and sell what you don‚Äôt need/use.
---
IIRC, both quests need materials from world bosses who only appear from phase 2 onwards, that's why I'm asking. It would be neat to knock out the rest of the questline in phase 1 though, I want to get my hands on that bow ASAP, it's been a dream of mine for over a decade now.
---
Some Salt to dry up his tears
---
Nope.
---
Druids will be able to tank, but no one tanks vanilla better than a warrior. Period.
---
That sounds exactly something an uncivilzed savage would say. What‚Äôs next, Voodoo magic and human sacrifice?
---
Isn‚Äôt endgame of classic wpvp in stv? One of the things I‚Äôm looking forward to most
---
This is classic, not vanilla. There are a lot of changes. Some good, some not so good. It's the best we're going to get.
---
Exactly my thoughts, and I have a healer friend and several others. We are like 15people starting together, so having someone to farm with aint np

No but how did you two talk? And how are you 6p? This isnt the beta

Played vanilla on alliance, everyone called it DM, because there was no dire maul for a long time..
---
&gt; There will be guilds on both sides at the forefront of progression that actively encourage streamsniping.
---
Good. I don't see streamsniping any worse than big streamers and their posse following them around, altering the world in that regards. In fact I believe the latter *is* worse
---
Nope, just gotta play better.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I plan on finding friends in game to level with. I'll be rolling a resto shammy, so I'll probably find a lonely looking warrior and be friends with them
---
Its Either warlock or hunter for farming dungeons solo. Possibly a shaman/paladin for some troll pvp with procspec
---
Your first mistake : lfm **VC**
---
How is it not vanilla? It came out in vanilla wow. Everything before the burning crusade is vanilla.
---
Imagine watching Asmongoloid instead of playing on a pserver or doing something meaningful IRL for two months.
---
Who was the bitch who sold get rich videos for wow? I def stayed away from that because I thought the same as you back in the day lol
---
Can't wait! Just like it was when vanilla launched... considering everyone started at the same exact time.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
Same!
---
/moo
---
It's a pserver
---
Streamers accomplishing anything = important
---
Why even play if we can just watch streamers do everything?
---
If you are a person who cares about streamers doing stuff in a video game... start going for walks.
---
I'll be leveling my butt off just to get there. I'll probably have more fun in that zone than anywhere else while leveling up. I love getting distracted in a huge battle for hours.
---
I'll see what i can do üòÇ
---
&gt;Dark Brotherhood
---
Oh no, who are they going to assassinate next?
---
So here's the thing about warriors. If my memory serves me correctly they get shit on in 1v1 PvP by most if not all of the classes if the other one knows what they're doing. However, to this day I won't forget the first experience of our Grand Marshall's team (Dwarven Warrior with organized backup) deciding that fun time in Alterac is over. 
---
As someone else said before - Warrior with sufficient heal is such a terrifying sight that it makes up for the class's shitty solo performance.
---
That exp bar is so perfectly placed lol
---
My generalization should have been implied. It apparently was lost in translation. Of course, nothing is absolute in this world. 
---
Classic will be successful whether or not the young ones stay; I‚Äôm not worried about that. The beauty of it is that we know what to expect. There won‚Äôt be any crazy blunders that Blizzard can make to ruin it. Classic is Classic. It is set in stone. Love it or leave it. It will still be here. 
---
It won‚Äôt be another overhyped and underdelivered Fallout 76, ESO, No Man‚Äôs Sky, Anthem etc.
---
Never heard of that but i googled it and those screenshots are so cute!
---
Leveled as a prot warrior (I know huge mistake) it took me 25 days played.
---
US- Alleria Alliance. We called it DM
---
Imagine telling people to imagine stuff
---
Tauren lore is wonderful. This is my favorite race. And I am not a Furry ;-)
---
Spoiler alert:
---
They won't, atleast not at 50
---
A little bit of me wants that failed server start for the true vanilla that I experienced all them years a go!
---
But with the beta being tested to hell and back mixed with today's technology and the money blizzard have, we should be looking at a strong start with minimal server downtime.
---
That's what you get for calling it VC.
---
Why would there be tears? On private servers this is already accomplished by hundreds of players.
---
Seems to be working Classic Threat Meter. 
---
 [https://github.com/EsreverWoW/ClassicThreatMeter](https://github.com/EsreverWoW/ClassicThreatMeter)
---
I know the nerf to npc drove the new meta but ultimately it is a meta to just rush. I was once part of a multi day AV. Played for like 6 hours then logged back in the next day to find the same group still pushing. The thing was that we just wanted to sit and battle in the field of strife for hours, make slow pushes, summon bosses. That was fun and new to us still. But eventually we just wanted the honor and pushing was better for us. We could of course go back to endless battles if we all agreed
---
Wrong. There is an LFG chat channel
---
Look how FEW warriors there are, that's crazy!
---
I'll make an orc rogue on a pvp server when classic releases.
---
Meanwhile, I'm trying to level up a orc rogue (lvl32 atm) on private server following joana's guide, but it wasnt that easy/fast because joana's rogue specific guide has no follow up after 16-20 Barrens.
---
When i try to do 31-32 Thousand needles (Shimmering Flats) the mobs (lvl33-35) are really tough for a solo rogue.
---
I hope his guide will be completed for both Faction/Classes
---
You come off as a female. If you let others know that, you‚Äôll soon have an army of thirsty orbiters to play with who will also give you free stuff.
---
yes it's on a pserver, and we communicated with emotes
---
I had no idea summit played wow.
---
"I¬¥m #nochanges aside from everything i don¬¥t like not changed!"

Top man thank you

A shadow priest can heal raids up until AQ40 and NAXX. You will need two sets of gear though.
---
On Gul'Dan it was always VC on alliance side.  Surprisingly the last two times I've said this I've gotten downvoted because this sub hates the idea that anyone called it VC back in vanilla.
---
watch out, theres recursive regexp that will kill your system
---
yeah fuck common lingo
---
Good boomer containment thread. Well done.
---
Misses‚Ä¶ Presses‚Ä¶ I hate myself for having to do this.
---
5-10 sec load times? I have less than a second
---
Most guilds dont take a shadow priest, you can use weaving to keep 5 holy
---
Honestly looks better than most UI‚Äôs from back then lol
---
Rip. Hopefully the load will be lighter in the morning when the hardcore crowd has cleared the starting areas.
---
I've been spending all my free time watching videos about classic and playing different classes on private servers to decide what I actually want to play.
---
because thats technically impossible as it needs to parse all your gear to do that properly.
---
Stat weight math is basically never linear
---
Is stratholm important to pre-raid gearing? or is there something else to farm there at lvl 60?
---
If youre actually certain you‚Äôll get tf then troll is bettee. If not Orc is better in every way
---
Even if server cap is 3,000 which was vanilla cap(I expect it to be higher). And each server fills to 3 ‚Äúlayers‚Äù that‚Äôs 9,000 per server. You would need 112 servers to accommodate 1 million players. 
---
There will EASILY be more than 2 million at launch if not more than that. Even if you use the logic of 5k/realm and 3 layers deep that‚Äôs 15k/server even then you need 67 servers to accommodate a ONLY a million players.
---
"Side 1 af 2"  
---
Der er et yndigt land, Br√∏ther :D
---
Do AoE spells like Rain of Fire and Blizzard have a chance to crit?
---
And along those lines, DoT's like Corruption or the tick from Immolate cannot ever crit, correct?
---
Jesus that sucks, why?
---
What happened?
---
I actually forgot that was a feature. I love the downvoted for actually being harassed.
---
As a Horde player I've never seen Horde use VC. Only on my alliance character, after the release of Dire Maul, did I ever see VC.
---
Horde wouldn't have the quest to kill Van Cleef so there'd be little reason for them to give him any significance.
---
you can tell this is legit due to the fact that its a square image .... brother be honest what size monitor was that.
---
in org, the i believe ranged ammo shot, just a bit north to AH?
---
None of this makes sense, is this how kids talk now? I guess my parents thought we were dumb but this is just another level of stupid.
---
There‚Äôs already tears
---
Depends how much time you spend grinding beasts. Some example math. It takes 6955 equal level mob kills to go from level 46 to 60. If you only grinded beasts (preferably boars, live to win) during that time then every kill would get you a thick leather or rugged leather, either of which will consistently auction for 6s a pop regardless of server economy due to the vendor value of crafted leatherworking items. That would make you 396.44 gold purely off leather after subtracting the 5% ah fee.
---
All non standard chats were global. It just required people to actually join them.
---
Somewhat related to firelands, but I thought the molten front was and is still the best daily quest hub type thing they ever did. The dailies were actually pretty fun and varied, and the exploration and progression through the zone was a lot of fun.
---
Why would you skip talent specs and purposefully gimp yourself?  For me Vanilla was my second MMO and I played countless CRPGs before that so I always tried to min/max my character and Google the most optimal build
---
You can‚Äôt enter the instance let alone get attuned to MC before level 55. They will not take publicly viewable beta to 60 because it shows the content to players who have never seen it, but they will have to have someone test it
---
Interesting thing about getting your first shoulders:
---
There is a quest in Loch Modan that requires you to kill elite ogre boss Chok'Sul which is located in ogre mound in north-east part of location. It is full of elite ogres. When you complete this quest you have to choose between green cloth boots [Kimbra Boots](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6191) or white mail shoulders [Durable Chain Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6189).
---
So quest developers valued white shoulders without stats as much as green boots (with weird stats though).
---
Played when I was little so never super serious, leveled a Paladin throughout BC and WotLK and enjoyed it. Considering doing classic for a little bit just to level/explore. What are in your opinions good classes for leveling as far as fun. Not worried about getting to 60 as quickly as possible, or doing any serious endgame content. One exception is no hunter because I hate having to deal with taming/leveling pets.
---
Does critical item effects proc the Shaman talent Elemental Devastation or is it only Shaman spells?
---
Lol its called having a job
---
Enjoyed scrolling. +1 my dude. See ya again in the world :D
---
This!
---
Only wrath babies called it VC.
---
Favorite movie shrek 2. My man
---
How can you make sweeping claims about people not playing hard games anymore and not know acronyms for the biggest paradox titles? You live in a bubble dude
---
I failed the fuck out of that quest first couple times i tried it.

Off topic, but when/why did letters start being appended to the end of these?

From r/SockofBadKarma
---
Lok'tar Ogar, brother!
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal efficiency. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job done. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking survive, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! For the Horde!
---
I believe the kids today would call it "DM me"
---
Killer is not the word I would have chosen xD
---
My server called it VC because dungeons were widely unknown and someone got the quest in westfall to kill VanCleef which is what sparked the LFG VC. It wasnt until after that they knew the dungeon was deadmines but at that point everyone was calling it VC for the quest to kill VanCleef. It had nothing to do with Dire Maul.
---
There is a spec that goes deep into disci and specs shadow until you hit the shadow damage debuff. If you run at least 4 locks, guilds usually bring one of those in their raids. But I'm not sure how effective you're in PvP with that build.
---
wtf does vc stand for
---
Twitch emotes make no sense anywhere outside of Twitch (even then their over use has become absurd) . At least acronyms link clearly to the long form version.
---
He gave you a great bro job
---
https://youtu.be/GTrVgogA6kU this class choosing guide helped me, it‚Äôs essentially from a PvP perspective only however. Priests are mentioned at 8:34 timestamp
---
You can fuck it as much as you want - it's still going to be the way it's played because there's no tangible benefit to turtling.
---
Do you expect the same reticence to accept a Druid tank for most content? I don't mean Naxx, but up through ZG/AQ20.
---
Why leatherworking? I was planning on skinning and mining?
---
Or ppl just got better at the game
---
1. No such hybrid spec exists, and PvP Shadow Priests tend to take Disc as a secondary talent tree. You can heal as a Shadow Priest with +healing gear, but it won‚Äôt be optimal.
---
2. Most raids will take one Shadow Priest in their raids. Getting your Weapon will be easy (you have Anathema in MC and have priority for Lok‚ÄôAmir in BWL), but for the rest Mages and Locks have a priority over you because their DPS scales better while you are just there to buff the Warlocks.
---
3. Yep, Shadow Priests don‚Äôt scale to well. But early on you can melt faces in your Rank 10 blue PvP gear.
---
4. Healing gear gives more +healing than spell damage gear so it‚Äôs obviously better for PvE.
---
If you haven‚Äôt healed I‚Äôd recommend you to give it a try, it‚Äôs fun and in BGs/large scale WPvP you are better off as a healer. 
---
You can also do both PvP and PvE in the same spec. 
---
If you want to play a hard to kill class with dots, Warlock is a more rewarding choice on the long term if you also want to PvE seriously, though they are harder to play in PvP.
---
Straight up traitor. Wtf is this scumbaggery?
---
This meme is really rad.
---
If it ppl can optimize AV runs to get more rewards in less time they will optimize no matter the patch
---
Stealing this.
---
It‚Äôs Rock Paper Scissors and you picked wrong
---
Tips has generally very little idea what he‚Äôs talking about. He claims that there are very few warriors that are capable of dueling at his level, for example, but his play throughout the beta has confirmed to many that he is very inexperienced with Vanilla. His videos have been plagued with misinformation, as well.
---
Yeah I'm not sure wether it's a good thing to take the 27th off. Last time I went for a midnight launch it was cata and it was just a lag fest.
---
Knowing I‚Äôll be rolling a lock, this just made me cringe.  Entire bag will be full.
---
This is quite an ignorant take. Twitch emotes convey emotions and are understood easily by other twitch users. ‚ÄúPog‚Äù conveys excitement, or ‚Äúthis person did something really cool‚Äù, anything relating to that, in just 3 letters. The other emotes do the same. The emotes will likely be overused, but the way you worded your response was pretty lazy and ignorant.
---
I use twitch emotes, and even say them out loud occasionally when with friends, not as aggressively as most others, but still. I‚Äôm a 21yo university student with overall Distinction marks, am I an idiot purely because I enjoy something you don‚Äôt?
---
I think it could be somehow done via add-ons but the method im sure existed was by making changes to the client (which is technically against ToS  i guess?)
---
Holy shit calm the fuck down. I'm just saying that a shitload people following one guy around all the time is not the vanilla experience. It's a multiplayer game, you can't just pretend that other players don't exist.
---
I'm pretty sure there's only one really competitive gun for raiding in the game and it's from aq40. All other bis are bows / crossbows regardless of race.
---
Well you are free to use the site that suits you the best :)
---
Thunderfury is the obvious answer
---
Bravo
---
Probably discord would have what you're looking for
---
Yea I think you are right about the game being successful. I guess my main point is I want the positive experiences to be the loudest voice this time around instead of the negative. 
---
What do you think about post naxx content? Think there is any need for it? Or do you think the game will sustain itself on the current content?
---
Nah, Troll is still better for Threat Gen.
---
Sarcasm? It‚Äôs difficult to tell.
---
youre not as smart as you think you are
---
Yeah many of the returning players, not all. Even if 90% are returning, that's still tens of thousands of people, maybe more. Like the notion they could not get everything out of the game that someone who has already played wow could get is just unreasonable and untrue.
---
It's an abbreviation of the boss name in DC.
---
I really like the play style of optimizing a groups dps by doing damage as a healer when there is nothing to heal. Is this possible on classic wow with to healer mana issues and damaging abilities costing mana? 
---
I play a druid on retail so do a lot of cat/boomkin weaving depending on the fight, is this possible in raids on classic? how to cat form ability scale (or not scale) with healing gear?
---
I suppose Priests can wand during phases of no healing, but i'd rather play druid if possible.
---
1) There's a build known as "holy weaver" which is kind of shadow. Its' really a caster buff spec, PI for caster dps and keeping stacks of shadow weaving up for locks. Most guilds won't bring more than 1.
---
2) Are spriests hard to gear? Yes and no. You're basically rolling on the same gear as a lock if you want to play dps. Some groups won't care if you roll. Others will absolutely not let you do it. Just depends on who you play with. Best bet for gearing an spriest is pvp. The rank gear is good for an spriest.
---
3) They scale fine in pvp. In pve, their dps isn't that good to begin with. The real issue is that they don't really offer anything that a lock can't do. They have subpar dps, take up debuff slots, and require full consumes to just bring it up to speed. Furthermore, a guild that gives gear to an spriest is taking gear away from a mage or lock that will arguably use it better. 
---
4) Prebis gear for a dps spriest and a healing spriest are completely different. For dps, prebis gear is a lot +shadow spell power without a whole lot of int, spirit, or healing. Complete opposite for a healing priest. You'll need 2 different sets most likely, but it's not that hard to get pieces for both.
---
I know what race, it's more so which faction I want to roll. I have enough friends on both and Vanilla MT experience to at least take a stab at TF.
---
Most guilds will take a Shadow Priest because that spec is pretty much useless outside of raids so playing it would take a certain mentality which won‚Äôt be found outside of the most hardcore raiding guilds.
---
You can toggle that off. And it literally only affects your own personal UI which is completely customizable via addons. It‚Äôs not an issue whatsoever.
---
When the game first came out very few players had a plan, but had such a fun time anyways they petitioned to remake the experience 15 years later.  If you have never played just start up your character creation and pick things based on whatever you find fun.  
---
Its honestly the minority of the playerbase that will be top in pvp or raiding looking to min max everything.  My first character was a druid who I made a magic user by talents but realized adding strength to my stats upped my melee damage, and one of the talents required a melee hit to activate.  I picked druid originally because I saw them on the fly shape shifting watching my buddy play before I even knew about the game.  
---
That paragraph might be confusing with no experience but basically I was doing all the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù things and still having a blast.  Its not always worth deep diving into game strategy and all that before you ever even play.  There will always be time to study guides, pvp videos and best in slot lists, its important to mess around and acclimate to the experience and find your own fun.
---
Impatient DPS player. JUST FUCKING GET ON WITH IT.
---
Step 1 : do not compare yourself to others , this is your own fun journey to go on , let the experienced guys give you tips and tricks but dont let them make u feel stupid or anything
---
step2: do not play on a streamer server if you are new to the game , its going to be full of toxic ass morons who think they know everything and guarantee these idiot kids will shit down your throat for not knowing some basic classic stuff. 
---
step3: have fun.
---
Great feeling that there arn't any huge streamers in the EU so I can avoid servers like this.
---
I'm just talking about while leveling. Winterspring usually has a lot of WPvP too
---
They should also add a cast bar and dot timers since you can get both with an addon.
---
[Imagine saying "KEK" outside of WoW.](https://imgur.com/6FHa6eJ)
---
I would also like to know if the wsg buffs when obtained show up in combat log like normal buffs since on pservs they do not show up.
---
But that's as high as the dps metres go
---
seriously, it's gotten so out of hand you can barely even talk to people about it anymore.. it's just become so normalized. but what the actual fuck, asmongold streamed his ABSOLUTELY NORMAL (just a few regular guys, not saying super funny jokes or anything, just goin thru it) deadmines run and got, oh, what was it, like 7 or 8 THOUSAND DOLLARS worth of subs? Near the end, one single person donated him 70x subs (5$ each, which he keeps like 2 or 3 of) at once. This is either the biggest money laundering scheme in history for people or people are broken as fuck. If you've got thousands of dollars to give away, these people are the last shits that need it.

TMW when getting level 16 shoulders feels better than a titanforged mythic item
---
dont mean to be course but am i seriously the only one who thinks this looks nothing like goldshire?
---
1. Do you guys expect the best way to be leveling first: regular/questing, exploring/getting paths or simply grinding mobs with the layering thing?
---
2. How likely is it that a addon like Questie works on launch?
---
Wow, does rank 4 HT really require 1700 +healing before it become more mana efficient than other ranks? How hard is it to get that level of +healing on a resto druid?
---
Correct. I remember the go to for most servers was world
---
100% true
---
Especially when you get it at a lower level then intended so it‚Äôs an even bigger upgrade in the long run, which holds so much merit then BFAs rng system
---
As long as there's still addons to change the raidframes then for me it's no difference.
---
2.0.1 is Burning Crusade though. You just could not enter outland yet. If you went to karazhan and killed the ghosts outside the instance they dropped the cloth items from TBC and had a chance of dropping green TBC weapons and items.

You usually don't take Kings if you're looking to tank, as a Holy Paladin will have it, and you're usually using threat-reducing blessings to essentially up your own threat generation.

Dustwind harpies in Durotar
---
if you guys are playing on an eu server, that would be amazing!
---
Was in closed beta, definitely called it VC once DM came out
---
I think people will be more accepting of a lot of different specs this time around. Everyone is a lot better and more knowledgeable with WoW and that'll help cover for the not so good specs.
---
Light feathers can drop from mobs at any level provided its either a harpy, moonkin, griffin and hippogriffs although they‚Äôre most common at the 15-25 level range. The single best spot of aoe grinding is the harpy‚Äôs in the harpy area of north west barrens.
---
It's the same thing that's been going on with YouTube for years now though, twitch is just more personal.
---
Pretty wild but there are plenty of people that didn't grow up with sports or hobbies and now they have twitch.
---
Not putting anyone that watches or donates because there is a reason it's popular :)
---
Is that double fiery weapons?? Love it haha
---
I don't see much of the value in Reckoning when you can't /sit proc it.

As Joana (world record vanilla speed leveller) has said:

1. Quest

2. If you can't quest, grind
---
3. If you can't grind, explore

Orc looks are what make it great, everything else is a bonus.
---
This is true, though it does give 3% hit, which is a fair bit, but since hunter hitcap at 9% and hit is really easy to get for hunters, it's not a big deal. At most times the difference is using a +7damage scope or the 3% hit scope. Tho saving the gold on that hit scope is fine.
---
If memory serves right, we used a void walker or two during the initial pull of Garr and all the adds that surrounds him.
---
and what about WPvP?
---
The problem is no one wants super long AVs.  They are terrible for honor and terrible for reputation farming.
---
A lot of people didn't really like it when it first came out because of that.  People would do it until they were exalted and never again because the honor was terrible.  The "multi-day" AVs were fun to look back on but most people would afk out when it got to that point because it was a waste of time to stay in it.
---
People are going to rush to the end because it is the most efficient way of running the BG not matter if you put in the old or new version in the game.
---
I suppose, but in a game where bringing 6 or 7 warriors or rogues to a raid, bound to be some overlap.
---
Just wild that anyone still makes their class or race decision based on what their friends or anyone else is doing.
---
Have they fixed the issues with pet responsiveness yet?
---
the first time i played i rolled a human warrior but i was maybe thirteen years old and basic as hell. since then i've only really played horde so i'm not sure. i quite enjoyed playing a shadow priest so maybe something like that. iirc, lfg always needed healers but i hated playing a healer /: yourself?
---
In blizzlike progression it should be phase 2 as majordomo had his loot added in patch 1.4, but no idea if blizzard intends to follow their progressive itemization that far. 
---
This would also mean that a lot of MC loot would be removed, basically all the good shit from pre rag bosses, and a lot of rag loot would be removed as well like perdition blade.
---
He said he‚Äôs gonna use this spec just for leveling in dungeons and then respec at 60. The odds that he‚Äôs always gonna have a Hpal with Kings is 0.
---
Hey, you asked for it !
---
Hilarious that the mods are hiding this post. Jealous internet janitors can't deal with not having beta. 
---
Straight up pathetic
---
Spriest is an S tier dueling and 1v1 spec. The only time bringing an spriest is worth it is if you have 4 or more locks. If not, VE is just taking up a debuff slot and creating healing aggro.
---
Night elf hands down. And not just because of shadowmeld. Wisp form is god tier for reducing downtime when you get ganked.
---
It's official we are old. [[semore.gif](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/3hrmvh/mrw_i_learn_rekt_has_replaced_owned/)]
---
I was surprised at it being that high too, but when I looked around people tend to recommend rank 4 or 5, so I figured it might be accurate. Also, some guides I‚Äôve seen have not included the down-ranking penalty, but only the cast time coefficient, which will recommend rank 4 earlier. 1700 is very high, it might be reachable with full end game bis and raid buffs+consumes. But I haven‚Äôt seen anyone with that high amount, nor done the math.
---
Hunter 100%
---
I think youre over estimating how many people will use the guide.
---
590 hours played , at 3 hours a day comes out to about 6 and a half months. They're worried about missing phases because people might speedrun to 60 then insist that new phases be released while they are still level 30 or so
---
Uhm, may I have some pie?
---
Cmon BITCHHHHH
---
On some [REDACTED] servers back in 2015/2016, barrens chat was often flooded by /pol/ and right-wing memes. Pretty annoying.
---
Don't believe that to be the case. Just take a look at the Tiersets. Sure its possible but is it feasible? 
---
Youbwould prolly need to invest A LOT more into your gear with Offsetparts and whatnot, and that includes even getting the pieces that other Speccs could prolly get more usage out of. I only see this possible inside a Raidguild but not with randoms in a Dungeon.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can enter MC till 55? If you can enter at 50 then it‚Äôs definitely doable.
---
yeah, you have to predict when he's going to do it soon and taunt then. But if you do a lot of duels, you'll develop and intuition for that.
---
Threat generation isn‚Äôt an issue for like 95% of guilds and even if it is you can fury tank. Orc is bis for both pve and pvp with the one exception being guaranteed tf
---
I've had a premade ask me (account sharer) to please let them get top spot one week.
---
What show?
---
I bet the person looking for heal and tanks for DM and calling it VC is either a warrior or an hybrid class.
---
Am I right in thinking that most of the crafting professions at max level are mostly rare materials and not necessarily ores/skins etc? Like elements, etc
---
T2.5 is significantly better..
---
WTF is VC
---
But if it's in your bank how would you know if it's off Cooldown? :o
---
Hi man, very good work on the site! Few things on my wish-list:
---
* could you remove any trailing whitespace from both ends of the search? So many times I copy paste a name into the search, and it tells me "Bonebiter " doesnt exist.
---
i am female but i don't really want it to affect who i play with. when i first played as a kid i was a 13ish year old girl whose online friends were mostly 19+ year old dudes, and some of them did give me stuff, but a couple of them made me really uncomfortable and in retrospect it was a bit creepy. it'd be nice to play and feel like a member of a team because i was very chatty and sociable so i ended up being kind of like a guild mascot even though i was never invited to raids or anything. (though to be fair, i wouldn't have invited myself to raids. i was a terrible player!)
---
:((
---
I'm not sure how it works - I thought it might be all damage sources when you have a 1h equipped. But either way, 2 points in either talent won't make or break anything -- whatever you like.
---
(I'm interested to test that out and see how it works.)
---
Still, you'll be using your blessing slot for Blessing of Salvation a lot of the time, maybe Wisdom for the caster. At those levels the 5% isn't nearly as big a deal as some of the other effects.
---
You could solo kite ivus back to the horde boss, who would make easy work of him.
---
interesting, ive never been annoyed by him. everything he does is amusing to me. which i dont find often. i cant stand any other streamers besides payo and mrshiny64
---
a spell miss? what?
---
Dear lord...retail mentality.
---
Why in the name of god you want to speed level?
---
Don't answer. Doesn't matter. 
---
You are making a huge mistake speed leveling.
---
Bagspace makes me cry as a mage. I look at people with all their bag space for crafting materials, trinkets, alternate gear sets, etc and I have to have 2 bags worth of space free to summon enough water/food for the raid T_T
---
I meant to say skinning my bad. 
---
As for mining I think it will be pretty tough to get your skill over the 125 hump on a fresh server, every node is going to be taken. There's probably enough copper and tin mines to get you to ~85 skill but then it'll be really hard to find silver nodes. So unless you dedicate a lot of time to leveling your skill you will quickly start leveling in zones where the nodes are too high level for you. Also there's going to be a high supply of ores on the AH making them hard to sell.
---
Herbalism is easier to level but the amount you get from vendoring them is quite low.
---
This is where skinning is so much better, you can level it easily and the leather can be vendored to npc's for a lot of gold.
---
I have found his guides in the past not the great and pretty misrepresentation of how things are on a thriving server and if you don't roll Hunter. I hope he updates it well, but I think I'll go elsewhere for my advice.
---
Or a Fall Out Boy song.
---
Jesus giving me a lesson about how I want to play the game. I'm not the only one doing this.
---
Dont ever tell me how to play the game kid
---
Not really.
---
I will actually avoid the launch window and jump on the train a couple months after the initial hype has died down a bit.
---
ach ja
---
A lot of people don't know this, but in terms of server-client communication, the server trusts the client about where the player is. The server does some checks to make sure you're not cheating like teleporting around or things like that, for the most part it trusts the client 100%. That's why your movement is completely smooth even with 2000 ping, and why there is no rubberbanding when it comes to movement.
---
You can even freeze yourself in mid air by freezing your client with a script:
---
    /run local start = debugprofilestop() while debugprofilestop() - start &lt; 5000 do end
---
Try it for yourself, this is regular ui code. This will actually delay your death when you're falling from extreme heights. Note, delay. When you unfreeze you keep falling to your death like normal, but you can use this to give you more time to press bop or slow fall for example. Although scripts can only run non-stop like this for about 20 sec before you get an error, and if you try to freeze your client in other ways for more than about 30 sec, you get disconnected.
---
Abilities on the other hand are still handled by the server, even if it's a movement-based ability like blink. In those cases the server will use its last known position of you. For example if you're playing with high ping, you will have a hard time dodging ground-based aoe abilities.
---
I understand the concern but you'll be fine. We're all so much more educated and experienced with this game now. And I suspect there will be a lot less "down time" for players as they'll know what they need to go do as soon as they log on. Rather being lost in a huge new world like it was back in Vanilla.
---
I get downvoted for this opinion all the time but most players who keep playing retail are never happy especially those on /r/wow. They keep clamoring for changes to make the game fun. These changes include making leveling easier, bigger bank spaces, more allied races, more transmog, etc. They don't want anything to improve or make gameplay more complex or challenging. Honestly, there isn't much left in the game for them and they cant move on because they invested so much into it like a religion. Other player subsets have been asking for classic, or quit altogether. New players enjoy playing a new game but get confused at the broken questlines from expansions.
---
A lot of predictions out there on how classic vs retail will perform, but there will be a big shock from going to classic at first. Casuals won't like it. But classic will start to solidify because more player will have more fun having a longer game to play and wild world pvp. They won't be tethered by achievements so they can cut loose.
---
Damn bro that's depressing.
---
then why so many people says stoneform?
---
stop beng a jabroni and just pull the trigger on a class.
---
fuck dude, it's a video game. are you unwell?
---
So this is what we avoid when we try to dodge streamer servers? Because if so, then it's 100% called for.
---
I hope he smells what you're cooking
---
That‚Äôs a highlight of the show
---
Mages &amp; Warlocks suffered with bagspace. Warlocks with soulshards &amp; mages had to have enough space to pre-summon enough water/food for all the cheap raid mates who didn't want to buy them. Because if you waited til raid time to begin summoning it would take a while and hold up raid. :/
---
Classic leveling is something else. You can waste so much time PvPing, exploring, crafting and doing dungeons (with bad players) yet still feel like you are progressing just because levels come at a steady pace and every new level unlocks talents, quests, gear, etc.
---
I'd go troll. I am hard 100% I will admit that I hate that they have bare feet but I have a few troll characters
---
I think just not touching your PC for awhile is the best course of action.  World of Warcrack strikes again
---
Good point about how the  loudest voices should be positive. But that isn‚Äôt reality. The news is probably the best example. Negativity is popular.
---
Post Naxx is the biggest crapshoot of Classic. The devs themselves don‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôd prefer to not even think about it until the Naxx patch is announced.
---
the stats on those shoulders are 3.6 roentgen
---
That's gotta be some kind of achievement.
---
I will check this!
---
He‚Äôs not asking for the db to calculate the correct stat weights, he‚Äôs asking for the user to be able to input stat weights, and for the db to output a list of items sorted by a weighted sum value using those weights.
---
And yes, that would be very helpful.
---
Iirc the harpies in 1k needles had a good drop rate and quick respawn

Aaaand its fixed ;)

---
Autism speaks.
---
I think the support rep is going to catch on to that by the 984th attempt.
---
the leveling guide doesnt do anything special, it just tells you in which order to do the quests. you still end up in the same zones as everyone else
---
Good troll post
---
Turns out if you do something for over a decade straight you tend to become good at it. Even the people who hate his guts have to admit that he nails this streaming thing.

Vancleef in Deadmines. I assume people used VC instead of DM once Dire Maul came out to reduce confusion.
---
If you have a couple of int gear then save them, if you dont mind then you can heal dungeons even if you're not spect in resto
---
I am really thorn on this subject.
---
For me, personally, it doesn't matter. I am watching streamers on a daily basis, and the hype is going up...but for many people is going down.
---
I want a GOOD Classic, so as much testing as possible is the better option, but I also want a proper community, and streamers make everything look easy (and for the average player it won't be), prompting many non-WoW players to just stay away from Classic (because it's easy) and making some people's hype going down.
---
Anyway, I think that beta should go to lvl 60, because from 50 to 60 it's a whole different thing, and there is A LOT that MATTER, that must bet tested : lvl 50+ dungeons are the bread and butter of Classic dungeons, and I want them to be as close to perfect as possible.
---
Same for raids.
---
In raids healers practically always just heal unless the fight is completely faceroll with no risk and you have more healers than you need for it. Healers want to constantly be casting heavily downranked spells to maximize their mana efficiency. Definitely don't want to waste mana on weak damage spells, and will rarely have any downtime to wand.
---
What is POG? When I was a kid a pig was a game, since when did pog become a word to describe something good?
---
I don‚Äôt watch twitch or YouTube, I‚Äôm gonna assume that‚Äôs where these memes are from.
---
At lvl 50 the tank (and melees) would miss so much he would loose agro pretty fast.
---
And he would get crushed almost every hit. Not doable imo.
---
Worry about your professions after you hit 60.
---
Yes only take first aid. The rest is a time sink.
---
This is why we seek to downvote streamer fanboy posts and posts that get mad at us for opposing streamers. The fan base is cancerous. Think, the seagull scene from Finding Nemo.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but:
---
i. Will new players need to download the full content of normal subscription WoW (all the expansions excluding Battle for Azeroth) to play Classic, or
---
ii. Will there be a separate installation for the Classic content?
---
I haven't played retail in over 6 years and don't plan on getting back into it, so I'd rather not reinstall everything beyond Classic unless I need to.
---
alt+tab while autorunning/autoattacking/flying
---
Saying it loud is kinda cringy tho.
---
I think most loot distribution methods have their problems but DKP is pretty trash. EPGP or Suicide Kings are much better alternatives than DKP though my favorite is probably just modified loot council with /rolls.
---
Ah okay, I like how I'm getting downvoted for asking a genuine question
---
You don't do any professions, only exception being skinning and first aid.
---
Was debating this too. I think this thread made me want to go night elf
---
Cool. I‚Äôll def be skinning. Unsure of what second prof will be. Maybe herbs since I‚Äôma rogue.
---
Aaaand you are a hero. Thank you :-) Any word on publishing the source code?
---
The joy of gaming is playing how you want to play. What makes you think your view is the right view? Leave the dude a lone jeez.
---
I couldn‚Äôt get past the English accents for a Russian story
---
Yeah, kinda a figured. So how much is it to respec?
---
play a hunter again. the nostalgia + the fact that they are a great gold maker/solo class. 1v1 is really good in pvp if you know how to use your traps and pet/kite. you will have a great time, especially leveling to 60 will be so quick. as a rogue, im envious.
---
I'll never forget zoning in on my NE rogue for the first time.  Magical!
---
It's a combination of both.
---
I got that, why else would I guess tips? Or r u doublememeing
---
Which professions should I pick while leveling a warrior? Blacksmithing and mining to level blacksmithing early or skinning and herbalism for pocket change?
---
Word, sounds like a plan. I've been wanting to try vanilla enhance too but no way I'm gearing that at max level. Leveling up with two buddy's that are both rolling priests so maybe I'll look into enhance tanking during some of the lower levels.
---
The deathcharger!! Some good gear too, like the 2h sword he drops.
---
Thanks for posting. I hope I join a raiding guild this time around for the full experience rather than on PS where I only ever pugged. Looks like good times, and I miss progression raiding.
---
The classic, circle what you want people to look at with your cursor
---
What's ironic about gnomes?  Escape Artist is possibly the best pvp racial for Warrior
---
People didn't really start to talk about flying mounts being a problem until Cata, which is when it really became apparent how bad flying mounts were for world pvp, community, and immersion.  
---
That said, TBC was the beginning of the inevitable. Even though flying mounts were hard to come by back then, it was only a matter of time until they became trivial to acquire and everyone already has them.
---
the guide is tailored to hunters (fighting mobs a few levels higher, killing some of the harder elites solo etc)
---
i found that running dungeons once for quests helps to give you a level or two advantage on the long run so you can still follow the guide
---
Started ally. Playing ally.
---
Is this just the best pvp build that also allows me to raid? If it‚Äôs gonna be an issue, I wouldn‚Äôt mind just respecing after I got my pvp gear for elemental, I just need a guide to follow.
---
So what's the latest official word on layering? As far as I can gather, it will affect all zones and last until phase 2? Is this correct?
---
None of those spells can crit. Arcane explosion can.
---
I couldn't find anything about collusion in the ToS (which have been replaced by the EULA btw), but this would probably apply:
---
&gt; Harassment, ‚Äúgriefing,‚Äù abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others
---
I doubt they are not going to test some Level60 Content. They probably won't open raids but I bet they let us level to 60.
---
Mate the first and last so far beta I was invited to was the BFA beta, that‚Äôs worse than playing since 2004 and not ever getting an invite.

This one might be my favorite so far. Love the attention to detail with the hair and beards, lol

Hello, yeh im the one running the site. Thanks for the kind words! No sadly we have no patreon atm.
---
What the fuck do these words even mean? I don't understand.
---
Why would you do that? You miss out on that nice little ‚Äúhype window‚Äù and it usually make it a fun group event for everyone involved
---
Don't forget about Hillsbrad
---
Yeah, WTF is VC?
---
For whatever reasons they expressed. You need to think for yourself and decide what seems most useful.
---
I can guarantee this would happen if this stupid blacklist idea goes through.
---
You know i was just trying to be nice . Have a good day.
---
Happy classic cake day!
---
Rogues are fun to level, so are warlocks and feral druids. 
---
Warriors, paladins are tedious, priest is kindve boring, so is mage. 
---
Hunter is fun, but you've said you didn't want to do that.
---
RIP.. we lived our life at least... see ya'll at the retirement home.
---
You lost me...
---
I never wanted in. Why? We'll start equal on release. And I wont get burned out that way. Also I'm playing with a group of friends.
---
Happy cake day
---
Agree to disagree then. I would argue that 2.0.6 is the first one that qualifies as TBC as it rolled out after BC released. Just because it's a patch that was used in BC doesn't make it a non vanilla patch
---
Wanna help picking class? Hell i will help you. Just answer my questions.
---
Lets start with: Do you want to tank, do damage or heal? Or maybe one day you are in mood to tank/heal and another to dps?
---
Hi, /u/antidote--
---
Skinning isn‚Äôt an exception, it‚Äôs gonna slow you down a decent amount as well
---
&gt; Why would you do that?
---
I don't like the huge groups of people and overpopulation.    
---
Additionally I do not want to experience the game with systems that should not be in the game under any circumstances, like layering or sharding.
---
I think it will be much more fun to join the game later on with smaller groups and people who actually stuck with the game.
---
Is experience gained, in groups, still affected if your group friend is offline?
---
Odds are there will be a few other looking to complete at the same time. Super easy for 3 to finish together as long as no one bails after looting their items first.
---
You can join the Classic Shaman discord if you wanna go more in-depth   
---

---
You can FD into Shadowmeld while waiting for trap CD for some slippery escapes.
---
It depends on the content and the class (duh best answer ever xD). Generally, it's possible to some extent while leveling, since most instances are fairly easy. So healers will be in their leveling spec (DPS). So as a shaman, you can easily do a few white hits without spending too much mana. As a druid you have the benefit of being able to DPS in cat form which uses a different resource. However, while leveling, the cost of swapping form of rather high compared to your total mana pool. 
---
In higher level 5-man instances it's probably possible as a druid to swap over to cat after applying hots to the tank - of the group is doing well. 
---
Druids are not very gear dependent in classic, but with neither talents nor gear (since you're wearing healing gear) you won't do a lot of DMG. 
---
Druid have a spec which is a mix of feral and restore, though, which should be enough to both tank, heal, or DPS 5 man instances. 
---
In raids it's harder because fights are longer, and the added DMG from a single healer doing some white hits won't mean much.
---
Sounds lame honestly.
---
Just play Warlock and be happy you'll always be needed for ports. Even if you are a trash tier player you will still get invites.

This is exactly how I feel about all these people coming out of the woodwork to play Warlocks. 
---
Like hey, stay over there scrub and keep sleeping on Warlocks. I see new posts everyday asking "are Warlocks a good choice for classic?" 
---
In no way am I suggesting it will be as bad as Warriors or Rogues, but theres definitely going to be a ton of fresh cookie vendors late August.
---
Sounds like Asmongold, he's one of the worst at that shit.
---
You could look that up in 1 minute on google if you really wanted to know
---
I searched and came up empty. Went to all the usual sites, but no luck. I never used these back in the day, but I think I might order it off Amazon just to have. Would look good on the bookshelf!
---
I'd advice to go for the money-maker professions at least until level 40. When you've gotten your mount investing into a crafting profession makes more sense. Or you could craft blacksmithing gear/grindstones and sell on the AH, but that's a less reliable source of income.
---
I hope people can still do quests in AV. For someone who is PvE-specced, it was one of the better ways to participate in PvP. 
---
In vanilla, I got exalted with Stormpike just by grinding quests. I'm planning on doing that again for Classic.

I tried looking at the chat of a popular twitch stream, to see what it was all about. I don't get it
---
Why do people feel the need to write 453 emojis that are visible for like 2 nanoseconds? What do you get out of it? .

It was such a milestone to get those grey shoulders back then haha

How it was on my server.

skip everything but first aid, level first aid on the tram/boat/zep
---
YouTube has a bunch of them just search history of Warcraft. There's a few developers that actually talked about it for an hour along with tons of documentaries if you search Reddit that I listed
---
Thanks!
---
Private servers got it EXTREMELY wrong. The build was basically a mix of 1.12 and TBC pre-patch (when EVERYTHING was nerfed).
---
They are off THREE times on bosses parry. God knows about resistance. Pathing is stupid, aggro range wrong AF, critical chance off the roof, etc. etc.
---
Classic needs INTENSIVE testing, end-game dungeons,  Ony and MC ESPECIALLY.
---
Beta needs to go to 60. Raid testing in-house, but tested nontheless.
---
Not even ONE Paladin! /s
---
&gt;You open with charge, getting this off is important.
---
They have "track humanoids", they know you're there before you can see them (the good ones at least).
---
When I was playing my alt hunter back in Vanilla, I always checked all the humanoids on my radar and I had a who window opened with everybody in the zone. If I didn't see your name in the who window, I knew you were an ally and I was getting ready for you.
---
No experience is only gained when you are in range of each other. Offline players are removed from the game and therefore out of range of the party to receive xp.
---
No penalty is applied to the remaining online player
---
The beta was a separate download for classic. I assume at the least you will have to download the classic client by itself.
---

---
I have the pdf can upload it later when I'm home if no one else has it.
---
It was called VC almost everywhere but I think some high pop places called it DM.
---
I have no plans on that atm, but who knows what the future holds.
---
Long queue times, I simply think that there is not enough players for it to go fast. Plus, not everyone has a mount yet. Playing AB without a mount is such a task.
---
Don't forget the Righteous Orbs from Strat living! Used for the crusader enchant.
---
Yeah, because EVERYONE was twinking at lvl 30 and every single group was made of 5 PRO PLAYERS.....Kesus, private server players are dumb AF.
---
It costs nothing to rez the pet, unless you account for drinking to get the mana back ?
---
Warlock main Druid alt here.
---
Just pick what feels good.
---
I want to be a warlock because they are cool, no other reason.
---
But ez tele to bank makes up for it.
---
You make a valid point for active accounts, but my this one hasn't been used for years. The password and questions were since changed. Yes, the authentication key is bound to that old WoW account, but even *if* someone decided to have a crack at the +80 billion combination code needed to **access** account recovery to begin with, I don't imagine them getting further without any other data (e.g. bnet account, name, address, billing info, etc.). The information available here is basically equivalent to finding an old manual with some odd torn notes in the trash :)  
---
But sure, you are absolutely right that people should be careful with publicly sharing information online.
---
1-10 literally takes like 2 hours
---
Don't forget the mushrooms !
---
I won't take it for that reason but it's the only gathering profession you can keep up in skill while being ahead and oftentimes suggested for gold income - though just farming certain mobs for your first mount will be more efficient. Usually I don't take any professions when running for a decent time.
---
Fury warrior
---
How about when you get some with actual stats on them? Best day ever!!!
---
i dont get it...
---
If you're gonna use the launch server argument, it'd be more logical for launch servers to use DM, as the game launched without Dire Maul. But it's questionable how many people on new servers were even new players. I mean, I'm sure there were plenty, but at least the forerunners in new servers would likely be experienced players who were rerolling anyway, so if anything they'd be more prone to use DM by that same logic as well.
---
From everything that I've seen on this subreddit it just differs from server to server. I feel like DM is more popular in EU, and VC more on US, but that's the only pattern I've seen, and it's still inconsistent even in the same region.
---
Backpedale and all
---
That doesn't change what he said.  Blizzard realizes the importance of streamers to advertise, and so they're already treating them as special.  If some nobody is fucking with your advertisement you're probably going to do something about it, even if that nobody is doing nothing wrong.
---
Look up the addon TullaRange, the 8.0 version worked fine for me on the stresstest
---
So what did he drop ? \^\^
---
Early, EARLY on, yes. But that will be insignificant.
---
Warriors simply are much better at survivability.
---
As for raids, forget about it. Druid's slight threat advantage on private servers will go puff in Classic, because 14% parry.
---
5 and 10 man, yes, Druids are a good option...but Warriors will still do better.
---
I would think raid guilds would be more restrictive. Tanks are hard to come by and often you'll take what you can get for Dungeons.
---
You don‚Äôt really need any gear to clear classic dungeons. Shit is so undertuned compared to Pservers.
---
Hahah tipsout, what a fraudster
---
you're
---
Pet unhappiness, make it mad at him, maybe make it abandon him if you‚Äôre still leveling.
---
I have found the [tome of translation](https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/14/17335670/twitch-emotes-meaning-list-kappa-monkas-omegalul-pepe-trihard)!
---
There is a happy balance between normal English and internet speak. That is too far into the realm of retarded internet speak, and shouldn‚Äôt needed to be looked up. 
---
We speak English in Azeroth, twitchbacks gtfo.
---
This is perfection.
---
Yeah they got so much better at the game that mobs started doing 1/2 dmg.
---
This convo happens every 30 minutes in Westfall without fail.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt they know what to call it when the dungeon/zone is literally named The Deadmines?
---
You want to fish up your own food and then cook it while speed leveling?
---
Point in Case being the WorldFirst Kill of Saphiron with a Palatank by Death n Taxes
---
Your realm was for retards.
---
This is a really weird meme that people didn't know what they were doing back then.  Sure may be in year 1, but on alts in year 2/3 after basically everyone has cleared bwl n shit?  Nah doesn't hold up so much.
---
So bloated, I have no idea what to do.  Only option is to level from the beginning.
---
Isn‚Äôt fury 1h?
---
I think yes it disappeared. 
---
I took [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/rnJ9jhY.png) 2 hours after dinging and I think I logged out in between.
---
On my server, it was DM until Dire Maul launched, and then it changed to bring called DM-VC or DM/VC (or for some just VC) to differentiate it from Dire Maul.
---
I really don't understand how servers were able to NOT call it something other than just DM once Dire Maul was launched to about confusion.
---
Not even close to the same amount of impact. In 90% of cases it won't matter whether you are a Dwarf or a NE.
---
Just stay awake for 24 hrs.
---
Prove it
---
That guy was a 10/10 piece of shit from a piece of shit

basically after years of bullshit excuses and shutting downs of private servers, the idea finally broke on blizzards mind that they could be making money out of that shit...so here we are
---
No it was just a normal chat that you could join, with max room size of 50.
---
Skinning will help you get your mount right at 40 instead of 41-43 which helps a ton with speed leveling.
---
**GNOME. MASTER. RACE.**
---
I was about 20 when TBC hit, Im so excited for AQ release this time around.
---
I didn't say it was going to be easy :D
---
But with mount it helps a lot, especially epic mount you can usually just run in and charge before a hunter gets anything to land on you.
---
This is the right comment.
---
Fury is for dual wield
---
Fury warrior with the right fast 2H is way OP
---
Pet looses happiness when it dies, so the hunter has to feed the pet back to max happiness. I assume the gold/silver cost they‚Äôre talking about is the cost of the food the pet will eat.
---
Don't tempt me with a good time.
---
Fury warrior with the right fast 2H is OP
---
Horde Fury Warrior is the only viable 2H spec in the game.
---
Something says you have an internal deadline where you don't want to lose your life and only play a certain amount so you are putting all this pressure on "I gotta choose the first character right because I won't have time for any other classes I want to play"
---
Pick a random one and get it to 60, doesn't matter what you go - stop pre determining how you'll want to play when you hit 60.
---

---
If the PvE zerg requires too much cooperation to pull off, people won't try it. You could see that even in later AV. If the initial zerg failed, people would give up and turtle.
---
Original AV had that level of difficulty.
---
Will there be a separate client for classic =? or do we just use the current client?
---
I ask because that one has 60gb of space required... kind big if i just wanna play classic.
---
Phat lootz as always üòÜ
---
The cooldown on shocks and their low spell coefficient (40.7%) kills the usefulness of spellpower as a sustained dps stat for enhancement shamans.  300 Spellpower is only worth about 25-50 dps from shocks, and that's assuming you take all relevant shock talents from the Elemental tree, every shock hits, and that you have the mana to keep casting the max rank version.
---
Realistically you're going to be missing 14% of your shocks, and you won't be casting max rank anyway because you simply don't have the mana/regen.
---
Stoneform is better but don‚Äôt sweat it. A hunter of any race should own rogues, so don‚Äôt worry about NE.
---
At a guess Min specs of current retail.
---
This "it's DM" elitism is totally bizarre to me, people didn't argue about this back in vanilla. Maybe DM or VC were more popular on certain servers, but no one cared and everyone understood what everyone else was talking about regardless of which one you used.
---
&gt; - Can Shadow Priests do a hybrid spec so that they heal in raids, but can be "shadow" outside of raids for pvp? I prefer not to have to respec constantly, and really enjoy Shadow. I'm thinking of healing to get gear and get into groups and get my shadow gear that way.
---
there are hybrid specs that work, but there is no spec that enables you to PvP as shadow and heal in raids without respeccing
---
&gt; - If not, are Shadow priests hard to gear/get into groups? When I played Vanilla I almost never saw one to be honest, and I know that this time around could be different so we don't really know for sure.
---
raids will bring 1, thats it. usually you dont find them in 5 mans as dps, just heal with heal gear
---
&gt; - Scaling: I know priests are strong at lower gears, do they end up falling off? Not a huge deal, just curious.
---
all shadow spells except SW:P have terrible scaling, meaning you dont benefit nearly as much as other casters do from spell damage
---
&gt; - This seems like a silly question to be honest, but I've really only played melee in WoW. IF a shadow priest can heal, do you need actual healing gear, or would regular spell damage gear work decent enough? I don't need to be 100% optimal, but also don't want to drag anyone down. 
---
you need healing gear, spell damage gear might work BUT you will also use shadow damage gear which does not modify healing. if youre supposed to heal as shadow spec and then dont even bring decent healing gear, people might get pissed
---
tl;dr youre better of farming shadow gear on the side while holy/disc specced and respec at some point
---
Just 2h fury. Dont mind the min/maxers. Especially 2h before you have a good amount of hit gear
---
I distinctly remember 12 year old me doing copious amounts of research and creating my first macro in order to complete this challenge.
---
Wow sherbert gd it
---
Nah all these warr mains are wrong and forgot one thing, shaman and their windfury
---
If you don‚Äôt have 100g at 40 it‚Äôs likely because you wasted money buying useless skills, skinning isn‚Äôt necessary to have the gold at 40, it‚Äôs just a time sink that‚Äôll net you a little gold. It‚Äôs not awful because you don‚Äôt have to go out of your way at all for it, but it‚Äôs still a lot of wasted time.
---
It sucks in pvp tho so yeah OP you can't.

Classic Winds does a great job making content. This video does a great job explaining some of what you are interested in.
---
You could very easily run it with unstoppable force, treant‚Äôs bane or brain hacker
---
It didn't in classic beta during the stress tests
---
I spent money on Reddit for the first and only time in order to reward you 
---
I need to see more garbage like this. It brings joy to my organs
---
So is every argument you or I don‚Äôt agree with.
---
You can run fury with plenty of 2hs and be hypercompetitive
---
Alliance side. First pair of shoulders I got while leveling was in Redridge.
---
lol. Wrong.
---
I think it's people who never played vanilla during retail and got their start on private servers who think saying DM rather than VC is some elitist signal.
---
Trade chat will be politics chat where people "discuss" their opinions by rephrasing what they've already said for the 40th time.
---
No DPS, man. Not in pve. You won‚Äôt have the mana.
---
You‚Äôll DPS in dungeons and PvP, but not in raids. Give up this dream of yours.
---
You're just bad, or the Hunter is too damn good.
---
In normal circumstances, it should be 50-50.
---
The lower the level, the worse the outcome for the Warrior. It's something you just can't avoid.
---
At higher levels, it comes down to the player skill.
---
What classes are good for pretty much all pve content? MC - Naxx.
---
I hear alot of "95% of all x's wont see the inside of naxx".
---
Like which classes/spec have no problem getting into groups for pretty much all pve content?
---
You will have all the threat with fire nova totem, also stoneclaw and all these extras.
---
Bosses aren't always the best for BoE drops, only a few have drops you can sell and not just vendor/DE.
---
Back in vanilla, I rode the AV ram mount without being exalted with Ironforge.
---
Disco Inferno - Excellent Band Name. Or Movie Name. Or Manga. Really anything short of a cheeseburger. Actually....
---
I ll be playing arms and im definitely getting into raids
---
It will be interesting to see how it plays out for sure. I honestly think casuals (me being one of them) need to have tempered expectations. 
---
I feel like a lot of people are deciding how they are going to go about collecting their BiS gear at max level. What 1-2K people probably ever killed KT in vanilla? I know it will be much more than that this time around, but still only hardcore raiders who dedicate serious time to the game are going to be raiding into T3. 
---
I think having healthy expectations will keep people from calling for nerfs and complaining about not getting to see all the content.
---
I've been trying to watch some Classic footage on twitch lately, and it's practically impossible to actually talk in any chat. It's just people constantly spamming dozens of emotes and inane copypastas.
---
its called DM
---
Human have desperate prayer ( same with dwarf lvl 10 ), and their lvl 20 is some self buff that manaburns the next enemy that throws a spell on you.
---
Troll has dmg reduction + healing reduction lvl 10 and some shadow orbs that does dmg to attackers. Basically shadow version of lightning shield.
---
Came here to say this
---
When will the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza begin when classic launches?
---
&gt; To be fair, there's nothing more fun than a server with a balanced faction ratio
---
Sadly this only applies to a very few realms
---
I would love to be like that, but honestly it seems like all the guilds are going to want only what‚Äôs already known to be good, which is lame
---
What was this made in?
---
At the beginning I felt the same. I leveled a lot, but nothing would fit.
---
Than I settled and exclusively played as a rogue. It was really hard for me to go with a new class after that. 
---
So one day, when queues were high, I asked my friends, what do they miss most ofthen while they are doing their dungeons..  by the end of BC and beginning of WotLK I had a druid. It was awful first, but I started reading quests and listening to the sounds and the music. (not watching some series always on top in one of the corner) Leveled a profession I never touched before, and went to areas I have never leveled in. 
---
Also do not zoom out to the point where your character is a blob, and do not mess up the ui by a fckton of add-ons that turn the game to a walking button and hp bar manager, ruining your experience. 
---
For me this turned out great, and changed how I looked at the game... Up until ToC, where I quit. Had some Legion but stopped that too and went back to private. 
---
Now I am even considering playing way more classes than I would have time for.
---
Try a Shaman or Paladin. I always loved their themed abilities. (shami pve spot is hard in vanilla though, but if you play on EU and on the same server I will help you out)
---
Then helms in the 20s and trinkets some time after, there's always something to look forward to.
---
The game is running on the new engine. This likely fixed now.
---
you're going to need to put ads up eventually if you want this to stay up without breaking your bank... there is also no shame in making money off of something that you put a ton of work into that many people get use out of
---
Lol sorry this was me on my gf account
---
If you don't say "ding" in guild chat, did you really ding?
---
Tbh, if they brought back the full old AV I‚Äôd take that loss.
---
I heard he has an 8 pack.
---
Apart from farming gold for epic mount, remaining skills, leveling professions and obviously farming gear is there anything I should start working on as soon as I hit 60?
---
Even in modern WoW towers still matter. The issue is that the BG consists of the two teams running past each other, trying to take all four towers as quickly as possible, sit around and swat away the five people who decided to be defenders, then once all four towers are gone rush boss. And the issue is that Classic may see the exact same thing happen.
---
Warlock are pretty fun tons of neat spells and you can get solo a few quests other classes cant, never have to feed or worry about pet happiness. Plus your fear is very strong in world pvp leveling before most have a trinket.
---
I mean if there‚Äôs thousands of people in a zone of course it‚Äôs going to take longer, if it still takes you forever when there‚Äôs a low amount of people in the zone then that‚Äôs just bad routing/gameplay. But regardless of the 2 hour 1-10 (which has been shown on the beta btw) the point was that ‚Äú10 levels‚Äù is a stupid statement as those 10 levels are incredibly fast, you‚Äôll  be spending more time on a single level later in the game than you will on your 1-10
---
It's treason then. Off with his head. I guess I should expect such villainous behavior from an alliance.
---
I lost at least 20 IQ points reading that !
---
Now get off my lawn, will you ?

I‚Äôm not sure, but [this Hunter bug compilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlfdu/the_definitive_hunter_bug_compilation_sheet/) may have what you‚Äôre looking for.

Yup. I will still do skinning thuogh, but just going to level it, only skinning if yellow/red

you don't want non-russians doing russian accents the entire time, they're fucking brutal

What‚Äôs wrong with Druid, especially as you played them in retail so you seem to like the class fantasy? The only downsides seem to be no proper Ress and that you can‚Äôt be a meterwhore during raids.

This is why if I ever make a warrior alt it will be a troll. Because troll master race.

How long do you think the first people will hit 60 this time around? Less than a week of playtime?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
This subs anti twitch stance is kinda sad at this point. The classic beta boosted wow numbers to the top and probably brought a lot of new eyes to this game. 
---
Sadly they‚Äôll have to deal with people like you guys. Get over it honestly when I think of vanilla wow I think of players in their late twenties to 40s. But with this vitriol over twitch and streamers it‚Äôs straight highschool petty shit. 
---
When did you guys forget to grow up? Just let it go. Avoid the streamers. Sit in your guilds and hate the modern kids ruining your classic experience. 
---
It‚Äôs just all so unnecessary useless anger at something so stupid.
---
I just want it to be in Russian.

It‚Äôs like setting a movie in Japan with Japanese actors and having them speak English.

Just another perk of leveling in Darkshore/ashenvale. My Dorf will have minimal competition while leveling AND a Nightsaber at 40!
---
Fishing yes.
---
Cooking? Not necessarily. If you are leveling a warrior or rogue cooking can be good if you have a good routing with it and getting the recipes. Monkeynews for example levels cooking, he's not "speedrunning" but still hits 60 very fast.
---
Shadowmelt is awesome. Have a cat with stealth as well. As you defend and want to attack your Target let's say wsg flag room, let the other in the ground floor and place yourself in the balcony. Shadowmelt yourself and stealth your pet. Let the other attack first so when you cast aimed ahit the player will not auto Target you. Great advantage for sure.
---
Idk I played strictly subt rogue (no points in other specs at all and never respecced). Was pretty fun and plan on doing something similar this time around.
---
No changes _from when_?
---
The real magic is getting like a fat +4 str +4 stamp shoulder for the first time as a warrior. Memes aside, it actually feels great.
---
I remember LFG was a local channel. Once they added shared auction houses in all capitals, people started using the trade channel instead.
---
And not to mention mounts...
---
Why not just level each class to level 10, and then decide from there?
---
I also had the wolf as a troll but from my understanding they're going to the OG mount rules
---
Anyone forming up an alliance guild, pvp, US East? Long ways off but looking for a weekend raiding guild...

You meant DM for sure hot shot.
---
Does paladin 1H spec (in prot) only affect physical/weapon damage? or does it affect other damage sources too (holy damage)?
---
On our realm the Horde completed the quest before Ally, camping the quest guy in Moonglade 24/7 so this Alliance guy couldn't complete his chain. 
---
After that they opened the gate at like 04:00 in the middle of the night on a weekday.
---
Fuck you Hellion on Maelstrom EU :P
---
You can speak whatever you want in Azeroth, grandpa

60 and never been in Dun Murough haha! Nice man

God forbid you confuse all the people in Westfall looking for a Dire Maul group.
---
Forsaken has the best areas imo.

*laughs in rogue*
---
They mention this in the podcast. The actors have a tendency to overract the accents and it was too much. 
---
They also mention that the other side of the coin is Russians don't really hear the accent in their own language, they're just talking to each other. So in an attempt to be more authentic, no accents gives the viewer more of a focus on the events and other surroundings rather than beating you over the head with a constant reminder that they're speaking Russian.

All we need is a meme of the guy who has to go to the roof to look down into the reactor core but it's the window in golemag room.

"You go look."

"No, I won't do that"

"It will be fine, you can see ragnaros"

He looks and turns around and his face is red

very interesting
---
Some reputations have some useful items. It may be worth looking in to which to work on first.
---
I do think they'll drag out the first phase 8 months or so though. I am confident that they will give people to enjoy leveling. Too much skipping content otherwise.
---
&gt; If the PvE zerg requires too much cooperation to pull off, people won't try it. You could see that even in later AV. If the initial zerg failed, people would give up and turtle. Original AV had that level of difficulty.
---
(Shrug). If you are convinced that the PvE mobs alone could not be beaten by forty toons working together, I don't know how you think AV ever ended, but I won't try to talk you out of it.
---
Back when I played in vanilla both sides tried to play defence to some extent, but I think that people know better nowadays. If defending means fewer rewards per hour people just aren't going to defend and the ones who do will get yelled at.
---
&gt; Additionally, winning wasn't a big deal in original AV. You wanted to do the quests and get a lot of kills.
---
What's the rep per hour of farming quests versus farming finishes?
---
....say I said 'Getting all payment that is do', how would you feel about that?
---
Attunement quests for MC and Ony. They can both be started before you even hit 60
---
More of a meme. Barrens chat is cancer, but it's fun cancer.
---
Presumably the first Sunday after launch.
---
Gonna do that. Thank you.
---
Do I have to do pre quests for some high level dungeons or raids aswell?
---
What faction should I play on release? I was too young to play vanilla and only played throughout BC/LK at which point your faction in regards to leveling didn't matter as much.
---
I've heard the Alliance leveling experience is much more refined and "complete" than the hordes. If that's the case is it likely that more horde content will be released later on that I should wait for?
---
I'm going to pretty much be a solo player due to other obligations so I want to get the most out of my leveling experience and really get into some cool zones and quests.
---
you can't post p-server stuff on this subreddit
---
I see, I thought it was until AQ but i guess it was BWL before the next upgrade, either way rhok'delar is pretty solid for the majority of the early to mid phase of classic ( MC till end of BWL ) since killing chromaggus means you're practically done clearing BWL , so you pretty much raid BWL with rhok'delar, that's a long time using a single weapon.
---
I also wouldn't really count on the crossbow from kel'thuzad tbh, not only is it the final boss of classic , most people won't be seeing the inside of naxx due to time limitations anyway, and those that do have the time to commit to naxx raiding will only get that Xbow after naxx is on clear making it somewhat irrelevant at that point unless you want to pvp afterwards or something.
---
I don‚Äôt think anybody loves AV period. It was cool to have a battleground where it was tug-o-war style basically. Having bosses killed it, definitely could have just made it a final base flag caps and hold for multiple minutes or something.
---
I think people love the old nostalgia and feeling of playing those long games when they were in their early adulthood spending all day playing this game. And what seemed crazy was seeing a battleground last multiple days. Its insane to think that would ever happen.
---
Now, who wants to play those long style games? Nobody. Private servers and retail all play it the same way. Nobody wants to spend 14 hours playing 1 battleground. They want to just see it happen. Once they get into that long game, they‚Äôll quickly see how terrible it was.
---
You can get this same type of enjoyment by raiding an enemy city and drawing more and more people in to make your own large battle.
---
I'd take them to 20. In my opinion, the level 20 spells made or broke a class for me back in the day.
---
You're missing the point that those words are annoying to almost every single other person who doesn't use them. Half of them aren't even default twitch emotes and require an extension to see, even further separating the "users".
---
I'll be a masochistic NE druid passing round them heals and buffs. See you guys out there!
---
Are there any blue axes obtainable from dungeon and quest content that will be better than dal'rends arms for an orc? I've been trying to decide what race to make my (probably fury) warrior, orc is the obvious choice given the axe bonus and blood fury. But looking through BIS lists I've only seen BoE epic axes recommended for orcs and I likely wont have anywhere near enough money to buy them. So, given how powerful Dal'Rends are, I'm wondering if they end up being better than the available blue axes even with axe specilization taken into account.
---
Unfortunately, even stream viewers have slipped this into their regular jargon without streamers around, i watch streams too but these kinds of emotes replacing regular language kinda takes me out of the classic experience and makes me feel like i'm talking to toddlers.
---
I wanna die.
---
Patrolling vietnam
---
That is why I liked Bachir Boumaaza aka Athene the best Paladin in World of Warcraft.
---
I was annoyed by him at first, but he grow on me. He also did a lot of charity and good. Today's streamers are just riding the dumpster fires collecting money. Doing dares and donate for charity if they fail. It's not their problem, the way they act it is the current meta of the world. 
---
But they could be so much more...

It's almost like language evolves and internet culture is basically it's own language at this point.
---
As someone who started with the release of ZG, it was a mix. Dire Maul had been out for like 6 months and had become a staple for regular established players in the "new guildie gear grind", so it became more common shorthand for it to be DM(inset wing/tribute abbreviation here).
---
Because of this and some subtle new player confusion, Deadmines did start getting called "VC" but by high level players trying to "inform" new players that DMW/E/N/Tribute were different dungeons than DM.
---
At least this was Elune-NA.
---
I know it's not going to change much because of human knowledge, google, and the fact that this is a 15 year old game, but the staggered release might have made for an interesting case study.
---
Iirc both are yes.
---
I know his horde routes are better, but there's a general lack of alliance leveling guides so this is the most reliable one I've found.
---
Feel free to link a better one if you know of any.

They took er jerbs
---
I tried to get my friends to come back, but they aren't leaving their private server. Project 1999, of course. EQ addiction dies hard. I need to get them to recover with WoW just like we did in 2004...
---
If you live in Central Europe it is midnight on the dot.
---
If you live in the UK it is one hour before midnight.
---
It's gonna happen regardless, Vanilla style chat is going to be dead or forced.
---
It was VC for most of vanilla on US Azgalor.
---
What does lol mean?
---
it's funny because 50% of those acronyms were never actually used in the game
---
Imagine playing a game that's 99% PvE for the PvP, lol.
---
I always love seeing UIs of DPS with raid frames out. Made buffing easier, but other than that, completely unnecessary as we‚Äôve all come to learn. Back then we didn‚Äôt know any better. Now I‚Äôll probably never use em.
---
I think when I was watching Esfand, his group had to go out of the instance to summon him back to the instance. I'm pretty sure this was after the level cap was raised to 40.
---
Saying twitch emotes is like saying OMGWTFBBQ back in '05. Let the dumb children have their fun üòÇ
---
Does 14% parry not affect warrior tanks?
---
If anything, the parry "change" gives bears a small +, because warriors attack more often and thus get more parryhaste.
---
https://youtu.be/OQtNrptbo88
---
I've always enjoyed leveling crafting, just because it was a fun part of the game and I enjoyed the small boosts it gave you. I solo level and my main will be a mage and I'll do alchemy/herbalism/fishing/cooking. I find using the lower level elixirs like minor defense at level 5 to be a non-critical but useful boost (especially when you pull 2-3 mobs). The only issue is bag space at low levels as both of these can take up 6+ slots pretty quickly. I'm going to need, especially in the early levels, to make very careful use of my bank which means I'll level in bursts and require extra trips to a big city. 
---
For this reason, I'll also be leveling a bank alt that will do tailoring/enchanting. This will primarily get me a 'portable bank' by using the mail but also more bags earlier in the game. 
---
This clearly will slow me down but as OP said, I'm not here to rush my level. The crafting professions make the game so much more interesting to me.
---
Good tip thank you.
---
And I wasn't refering to running Dungeons with those Tanks but actually giving them Items and not just needing against them which would make gearing even harder as theres quite a bit of overlap between Feral druid and Rogue/Offwarrior in terms of Leathergear. And yes Offwarriors wore leathergear as the stats were just vastly better for them and when Armor/Tankyness is not really of concern they will just about wear anything they can get.
---
Same with those Cloth/Leather wearing Heal Shamans and Paladins (then again you mostly had paladins for buffing only and a bit of heal)
---
"common" to twitch chat, sure. Complete gibberish to anyone who doesn't watch streams.
---
You should start working on you attunement for Raids, and work on getting all the keys you will need. 
---
Here is a list of the Keys you should look into getting to make your life a tad easier in phase 1:
---
Shadowforge key for BRD
---
Skeleton Key for Scholomance.
---
Key to the City for Side entrance to Stratholme dead side.
---
Seal of ascension for UBRS ( this one is a difficult one so people will actually pay you to open the door for their group.)
---
I‚Äôve never leveled a gnome or dwarf, I‚Äôm looking forward to that change as well.
---
No critical! Only little numbers! Correct!  Initial immolate damage can critical! Same with Mooonfire!
---
I wanna make a Tauren but their size always put me off to any class but warrior. What Tauren race did you play and why? 
---
Also druid form for a tauren never made sense to me. You are a fricken bull for crying out loud. Why would you change into a bear or cat?
---
but it doesn't let people know you're one of the cool e-kids
---
for me it still does aha
---
Will do that. Thanks a lot
---
20/31/0 is what I'm planning on running for the same reasons.
---
What do you think of Imp HoJ? Would the cooldown reduction be useful for using HoJ as a way to deal wih mobs you lose aggro on?
---
Literally **unplayable**.
---
Nope. I was on Blackrock and we called it VC because the quest told you to kill Van Cleef but never mentioned the word Deadmines.
---
Tanks and Healers. Besides that, the saying was that "95% of all people wont see naxx from the inside" because their raidprogression wasnt that far, and not because they didnt play a certain class.
---
I arrived at the same link, url could be bugged
---
Oh? You're critting me? You're not running away?
---
That text on the screen is a manual message from a raid member.
---
If you pick Human, you get Diplomacy which is very handy, and weapon skill. Perception is okay but you're already a strong enough counter to Rogues as a Warrior.
---
If you pick Troll, you will regenerate 5 hp per second and there's nothing anyone can do about it
---
choice is obvious
---
A popular thing on private servers is reserving some kind of loot. For instance taking the first righteous orb in Stratholme, Alchemy recipes in UBRS/Scholomance. This can be frowned upon though so do it at your own discretion.
---
Wells Fargo stagecoach could have delivered it faster...
---
Dude if you "say twitch emotes out loud", no kind of education is a redeeming factor.
---
Yes they do!
---
You can't dodge ranged attacks in vanilla, and their bonus is only 1%. It's not noticable at all.
---
12 year old me was pretty disappointed that most of that acronym guide was useless. It doesn't even include ERP.
---
This is **the** reason why people wanted **proper** progression from 1.1 and not 1.13 **easymode** that allows even the filthiest of casuals to swap bags like this!
---
I love the Night Elf area as well as Tauren. Night Elf goes from their little island to Auberdine, which is my favorite questing area ever. I‚Äôll be going back on my Gnome Mage come release.
---
Getting hit by lots of mobs while aoe grinding or tanking will still trigger it pretty frequently. I also read somewhere that it's pretty good threat because SoR procs on every extra swing.
---
Yeah, crap like that is why I joined Alpha Beta Fish instead of MAGA. No twitch memes in my guild chat!
---
Wait what the fuck is the top picture?
---
Phase 1 is day 1. No one knows about the other phases
---
You get to play in like 2 months and you don't have to test their game for free.
---
Even with it stating being goldshire, I dont see any resemble.
---
I remember my first shoulder triangles, man the magic.
---
It is true. Vanilla raiding is very simple and rotations even simpler. 95% of raiding is getting your gear and consumes ready, and having 39 others that did the same
---
Half the screenshots are pserver stuff lol. You just can‚Äôt name what pserver it was on.
---
Played every Tauren class possible. I made my Warriors (and later DKs and Pallies) male, everything else I played as a female.
---
What will be tough about Classic, unless they fixed it as part of the QOL upgrades, will be trying to ride a Kodo in cities like UC. We are gonna be bonking our heads on every doorframe. XD
---
Can I gorge my permission slip from my wife without getting caught? How close is the scrutiny?

As a Night Elf Hunter, what are my full options for the mount I can buy at 40? Is there a good mount list/guide somewhere?

LFM Retirement Home
---
Didn‚Äôt that story end with the son aka BFA being spared / *not* being sacrificed?
---
It will be difficult, allah help you if your wifes son catches you
---
Are you really bothered that much that I ask for this? Does it really affect you every day life that you have to complain with a demeaning question?
---
A hunter should never even worry about rogues, especially with pets following in stealth confirmed
---
I‚Äôm going to be so upset as a mage...I have been playing with the heirloom shoulders for so long, but the early cloth shoulders are so tiny by comparison.
---
Raid groups from my understanding will stay relatively similar for the entirety of vanilla, at least from my understanding. As long as you doing roll into a dead spec, you should be fine. Examples of dead pve specs are, ele sham, emu sham, Boomkin, bm hunter, shadow priest, feral Druid, sub rouge, Ret paladin, affliction warlock, and protection paladin.
---
But if you have to put subtitles on it gives you an excuse to not look at the action. When their skin was falling off you need to look at that and not little letters at the bottom.
---
Same for my druid in leveling dungeons
---
&gt;(could write a doctorate thesis on this alone)
---
Someone will...The business side of me would be fascinated to be able to understand the decision making of WOW start to finish.  I suspect that they completely misdiagnosed what built the success and heavily focused on trying to hold onto the casuals that came post marketing efforts (TV, Memes, Youtube, South Park) while not realizing that they were not the core constituency of the game.  Hell, they were making +150M a month at one point, of course they tried to keep that train rolling.  
---
This will be studied at Harvard Business School at some point.
---
I got pretty much the same amount of time to play. I want to enjoy the game that I loved so much 15 years ago but as far as I can remember it took about an hour just forming the group and getting everyone to the dungeon portal so 5 mans are not an option for me.  
---
My solution is to make a Gnome rogue and make it slowly to 60. End game for me is gonna be WPvP ganking in blackrock mountain.
---
Original AV had tons of people complaining about "too much PvE in my PvP", hence the changes in later versions.
---
Bringing back 1.5 AV isn't going to magically make players want to sit in 1 battleground for 6 hours.
---
guess only the future will tell
---
Just did this jump in beta, can confirm nobody missed it entire party cheered
---
&gt;organized forty-person
---
Yeah and how often does that happen, only premades. 
---
Bring back old buff AV, ya nerds!
---
Its easy you never run DireMaul but DME(ast) DMW(est) DMN(orth) or DMT(tribute) and the levels the ppl were looking for also was a good Indicator...
---
So DM only ever could mean Deadmines
---
What are you even talking about? Why the tears? They were legitimate questions. How else do you think 99% of everybody else did it?
---
My guild has class officers decide who gets the loot.
---
I keep a list of attendance, gear, and who got gear last. I gave a word doc that lists the date, who was present at that raid and if they got loot. 
---
Classicwowbis.com tells you what is bis for what class and how long. I also have an excel sheet for class priority for certain pieces of loot in mc/bwl/ony.
---
It's less "brainlets" using the term and more avoiding repeated questions like "Wait, did you mean Deadmines or Dire Maul...?"
---
Your own factions mount is Nightsaber, other race mounts are locked behind rep (revered?)
---
I love AV, it was a whole lot of fun
---
Getting the unstoppable Force was one of the coolest things ever. Long after I had a stronger two handed I would still switch to it whenever I was on a bridge or mountain
---
The six hour matches were a drag, but I actually really really enjoyed the hour long matches.
---
It was pretty popular on my server. I rarely had to wait very long to get in and I got my rep to exalted pretty quickly.
---
He might have been in leadership, ex: class lead, recruitment lead. You'd watch raid frames to see which dps managed to get themselves killed.
---
Wow, so original!
---
I like alliance mostly because it's hard to get around the horde cities. I tried horde in wrath for a while and went back after a couple months.
---
Wrong reply bro ü§£ I'm on my phone

While the raids have simple mechanics, it‚Äôs still difficult to get 40 people to do it all properly.

Joanna always borrows gold for his mount.

Horde 2h is similar dmg due to windfury

Except I can run two 40 min runs while you're running one. Thus I get double the loot. So there are prizes for being fast!

Starting as a human you'll be killing lots of wolves and boars. You can easily get to 50 cooking with this and begin making [Spiced Wolf Meat](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=2539)

At the end of the day you are playing a game. If you are more attracted to one of the two options, just follow your gut. If you have to stare at the back of a choice you didn't fully support at the time of choosing and have to level it to 60, your chances of success diminish.
---
He started in classic
---
And if you were on a faction unbalanced server, doing your quest for IBS/Stoneshatter/Unstoppable Force was terrible. It look me 11 games of AV to get a win in vanilla. Because of how little I played, that was almost a month after I hit 51.
---
For the record most serious PvPers and high ranked players always go for Night Elf. Shadowmeld is way too powerful when used right. And hunters already counter Rogues, Stoneform is good but not that needed.
---
Wow spicy mayonnaise
---
The real question I want to know is this: Why do people spam those emotes in twitch chat anyway? It's literally just spam, there is no content. Why do people do it?
---
I would say an hour or 2 long match would be good in my opinion. For a massive scale BG and other things to consider, it seems like a good match. But to have 2 day long BGs? That‚Äôs just insane to me. I could get a lot more fun PVP in with WSG or AB at that rate.
---
First upvote from the one of many.
---
The Sims 4
---
In addition to the Google, you can roll a character on the server and check the server time.  Default server time is always in the servers time zone.
---
They were so bad though. Like, that intro quest in Icecrown, where the orc commander I'd happy that his soldiers have backstabbed the Alliance squad when it was attacking the Scourge. In the heart of Icecrown, dude...
---
To each his own, one of the best parts of Vanilla is that there are so many ways to experience and enjoy it and none of them are truly the right way. Personally though, I think you should at least log on for launch day. Sure, we‚Äôve all been around for opening day of expansions, but most of us weren‚Äôt around for opening day of the World. I think you‚Äôll be happy you did it, even if you log out after an hour and wait two months.
---
The people that tell you they don't have time for long AV just want the PVP honor / rewards, they don't care much about the BG.
---
They leave when they encounter another premade that will make their WSG / AB last more than 10 minutes.
---
They're not playing, they're working.
---
You can't get attuned before 55, but can't you still enter molten core earlier through the portal in BRD?
---
Have you ever played AV on live? Everyone knows how to properly zerg AV and take down the towers at this point. There's no coordination needed.

Oddly enough... That's EXACTLY what's next mon

You can also train cooking to 50 purely to make some cooking quests available for good XP.

I still rate it at a 7/10.  Everyone could play perfectly and it would still be 7/10.  Because nothing is more difficult than getting 39 other people to show up on time and pay the fuck attention.
---
I don't think today's perception of the Vanilla raider is all that accurate.  There were many guilds with very good players who didn't do any keyboard turning, clicking, etc etc.  The issue came with finding 40 people who got along and all played at the same level of competency.  What usually happened was that most guilds were amalgamations of cliques with widely varying skill levels.  X is the best rogue in the guild, and in the top on the server.  But X has three friends he must play with and a wife who are all poor to mediocre.  They come along.  Vanilla was more about the bonds of friendship, and yes a lot of people did suck, but a good many knew how to play MMOs.  
---
We also must consider that everyone's most recent experience with raids are from inaccurate private servers or late Vanilla.  I hate to beat this horse anymore, but MC was challenging mathematically when it released, so was BWL, so were all the raids.  Challenging mechanics didn't come until much later into the game.  
---
The beginning raids of Classic will further enforce the belief that people in Vanilla were all noobs who knew nothing, which is blatantly false, because of how quickly Molten Core will be cleared.  It's not because people have "Really learned the bosses" but because we will be playing on the "see it before it's gone" catch up patch in Vanilla.  The mechanics were always easy.  So easy that most people barely did anything besides eFlirt in raids with girls while doing trash and boss pulls.  In BWL for some fights paladins literally stood still and spammed decursive for a few minutes.  MC was a joke, BWL was a joke, most of AQ 40 was a joke.  But, the instances were tuned in just a way that it was difficult to overcome by the math.  A point which was exacerbated by the cardinal rule of good players having RL friends who sucked at the game.
---
Which addon? I haven't found a single addon that could do this with a 1.12.1 client.
---
And yes, client modifications that give you a unique advantage would obviously be highly against the rules. Why would Blizzard make Classic changes based on what cheats were available in vanilla?
---
What is typical parry rates in private servers?
---
You just shift click the name to see what lvl they are. If they are low lvl, Deadlines. If they are high lol Dire Maul.
---
I did the same thing on a couple of my characters. The caves were usually empty of other players, could skin them and lots of ores. Iirc the big ones were dangerous
---
You probably roll an Orc and identify as a Night Elf.
---
I think it is Vulture, but not 100% on that one.
---
He said on stream he started during naxx (vanilla)
---
Not to nitpick, but how would one launder money thru twitch? Like doesn‚Äôt laundering money require some sort of cash sale? And you can‚Äôt sub with cash?
---
Alliance leveling in particular is really janky though. I've been messing around on beta, and none of the zones after Elwynn for awhile can you just "stay in and complete" I had sort of gotten about this with Vanilla/Classic WoW, that you have to hop around zones or deal with really slow, painful leveling as the zone randomly kicks up in quests/mobs to 2-3 levels above you.
---
Loch Modan and Westfall face huge cliffs that require you to come back when you've gained a couple levels.
---
Joana's guide has you go to Darkshore (Will be less people there) once you finish Elwynn from 12-17
---
Only played a little bit of WoW on Wotlk (fury warrior) private server and now I'm thinking about trying Classic. I was looking up some class (alliance), I always liked Hunter, but I saw some people say it's very weak in classic for PvE. Is this true? Is this class worth playing?

Horde Sided 2H Fury can be as competitive as dual-wield granted the Player knows how to time their auto attacks with the Windfury procs by using abilities appropriately with the swing timer. Bonereaver‚Äôs Edge (BRE) is insanely powerful with Windfury for DPS output
---
Well they were easy back in 2005 so they'll be even easier this time around. They will still take time to get sick of though because of the slow gearing and gear checks here and there.
---
TIL. I thought it was for whisper because when you try to get someone's attention quietly you literally make that sound.

Vailing cavern is horde nubb

I would get that instead of toughness, yeah. For pvp too. I just thought he didn't want it (but I see now it's just that I didn't finish reading his post...)
---
Somebody the other day mentioned 31/20/0 for tanking dungeons - I guess holy shock would generate a lot of threat on one target. And then you have the best healing spec too. So that's an option too. But I think for fighting large numbers of weak guys the 20/31/0 would be better.
---
LOL me too!!! Then the post said ‚Äúmages and priests can never have enough of these!‚Äù I was like... why the fuck do mages and priests need light LEATHER??? Did I miss something in Vanilla???
---
Make one character of every class. Then just play the one you feel like that day. Yes you might not make it to 60 but so what.
---
Most of the players I knew thought add-ons to be cheats. Later on it became more acceptable.
---
Not really AoE but I get a ton in Darkshore
---
Yes, in year 2/3 the likelihood of someone running an instance in better gear with more knowledge is a certainty.
---
It isn‚Äôt a meme. That‚Äôs the way everything works.
---
They do! Doubled checked on one of the classic wow databases. You wouldn't be bothering questers since they don't need to kill them. There's that crystal quest also I think, but that's to loot the crystal. You might be doing them a favor clearing out moonkins

you mean that noobs may prefer stone since they cant manage to kill a rogue using their class wel but hard players don't need it so they can go for SM?
---
Honestly he was my favourite character, killed it in every scene he was in.
---
I thought an organized fourty-person is a premade tho
---

---
Check out this guy with all the free time in the world!
---
So at 40 you‚Äôll really only be able to buy your own faction mount and that‚Äôs it?
---
Druid it is!
---
I believe he played warlock in tbc. Not sure what class in vanilla
---
Elwyn, westfall, redridge and duskwood are awesome
---
Guess you simply havent seen this angle of it then, its not that popular. You can see Screens of the lions pride inn on my Twitter.
---
You're missing out on a great fucking show man. The cast isn't Russian but they are world-class actors, Stellan Skarsgard and Jared Harris together are remarkable.
---
In a 1v1 setting rogues won‚Äôt give you any issues. Feign death + freezing trap is your best tool and I‚Äôm pretty sure you can do that around level 30-40(idk when you get feign death). If you want to min/max for pve, go dwarf for the gun spec. If you want to min/max for pvp(which is what I‚Äôm doing), and especially for wpvp, go Night Elf. Even though shadowmeld can‚Äôt be used in combat, it‚Äôs a lot stronger than you think.
---
Dumb post.
---
Why would there be tears?
---
Why would anyone even care?
---
I can say this aswell. Doesn't mean it is true though. And in case of Asmon...I wouldn't be surprised that he would really start in vanilla naxx... on private server.
---
It isnt Goldshire proper, its the house right behind it with the pentagram kids easter egg and the fishing trainer. Also its facing the wrong way. Looks pretty decent though
---
An arm and a leg. Resec caps at 50g. Be mindful lvl 40 mount still at 100g is a large accomplishments and epic BoEs sell for 100-200g in the AH. To help you put into perspective how expensive it is to respec often.
---
Sorry, i shouldve said that in the title! üòÖ
---
Good job smelly troll
---
I haven‚Äôt been following too closely, but let‚Äôs not forget that this was exactly the attitude before BfA. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just beta‚Äù became ‚Äúit‚Äôll be fixed in the next patch‚Äù etc... look where we wound up.
---
If those are your main concerns, may I introduce you to [Suicide Kings](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Suicide_Kings).
---
I'm pretty sure honor worked different back then though, and was nerfed, so that a BG that lasted days would actually give you shit honor. So unless both things happen, older AV and removing the nerf, then it's not worth it to be in a BG that long.
---
I don't remember exactly when it happened, so someone correct me if I'm wrong. But honor gain was nerfed so that fighting in big groups made the gain a lot less than before. Something about diminishing returns on killing the same people over and over. It's been a while so I don't remember exactly.
---
If I understand correctly, items added on 1.10 (such as spellweaver turban) will be added in phase 5?
---
For horde you spam hams for wf procs. Alliance you rage dump improved slams, and need to pay attention to your swing timer. 2h fury does well and you'll gear up faster than your 1h fury counterparts. 2 or 3 2h fury a raid against 3 or 4 1h fury and 5 rogues all trying to get the same gear. You also spend half the DKP on weapons and get your other pieces a little earlier with your increased buying power, especially over rogues that are getting tier gear.
---
5%
---
is a 0,02% loot rate isn't it? dosent seem to justify the effort
---
Don't think any more about it and do this - pick several classes and get them to 15-20.  If none stand out as the one, play them till 30 [or a new class]. When you're in the game, one should start to be your fav.  easy.
---
Not really, it should be useful for both type of players. Just gotta learn how to use it. Hunter in PvP is pretty hard to master already so you gotta know what you are getting into.
---
Looks like a lot of addons got released this week with little fanfare!!
---
Be sure to check it out, guys!  https;[//willitclassic.com](//willitclassic.com)  Your community led source of addon information.
---
On another note. Looks like Curse/Twitch has finally added a version category for Classic. If someone in beta could test out the twitch client and report if it is filtering and updating for you that would be great.
---
Also.. someone... PLEASE test out Details :)
---
You didn't even watch it.
---
Warriors- furry and prot
---
Priest- holy and 1 shadow priest or 1 disc / shadow priest.
---
Mage- (for Naxxramas) will be Fire
---
Warlock- sm or ds spec
---
Shaman- Resto
---
Druid- Resto 
---
Paladin- Resto
---
Rogue- combat 
---
Hunter - MM 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Honestly play what you want, it truly doesn't matter. If you can clear Uldir heroic with gray parsers in the raid, you can clear anything in vanilla with a decently played ret paladin.
---
Not that I agree necessarily, but OP probably doesn't like them as much because they don't stand for anything like lol lmao lmfao.
---
I don't recall when the change happened, but will of the forsaken went from something you could activate for 5 seconds of fear/charm/sleep immunity to more of a fear/charm/sleep removal. do we know which one we are getting?
---
Asmon on a private server? Yeah you clearly know him
---
Yes unless you rep grind to exalted with the other factions which takes a WHILE
---
Its DM not VC.
---
Horde locks have to deal with paladin dispells along with priests plus fear ward. Sucks too
---
I think you‚Äôre thinking too hard on this joke.
---
There's videos  on YouTube and pics of him on classic?
---
It was sarcasticly mocked that I remember and didn't take over channels. There's a weird obsession with just spamming channels with crap emotes on Twitch. I hoping that won't be the case here since there was a cooldown on public channels.
---
Nobody expected you to sit int he battleground for 15 hours. You could go in for just a couple of hours and leave. They've just made it all about instant gratification now, where it's not about the game, it's about the reward. That's lazy game design in my opinion.
---
Basically me everytime I die in WPvP. "What went wrong?"
---
DKP is the most fair, hardcore and ruthless loot council without any bullshit like ‚Äúfairness‚Äù or being a circlejerk of close friends is the most efficient. 
---
Organizing a GDKP pug or selling loot is the most AnCap thus the best.
---
Well I've always preferred alliance levelling zones but it really is a matter of personal preference, and you can have a fun experience on either faction. Horde for example has two early dungeons and the huge zone The Barrens, which I like because it contains a lot of quests. I've always preferred the buildings and atmosphere of the alliance zones though.
---
As for class, what playstyle takes your fancy?
---
Learn how to make gold lol  
---
There is even a guide to warrior maraudon farm, you can get a priest and farm dm as well there is a lot of ways to make gold, even mining/herb or alchemy/blacksmithing can make you a good amount of gold.  
---
All specs are viable into raiding, but some are optimal (you could say that if you are not at that spec you will slow your guild down, but that's not a problem, you still will get content).  
---
Making gold is stupid easy, there are a fuck ton of strats.   
---
Say you are a tank, people will cry for tanks at level 40+ because there will be almost none. So you can ask for items to tank, I want all resist gear or this or other item, something like that, and people will accept because they need a tank. don't worry about the spec and respec :)
---
Hmm okay, thanks! Another part of choosing a race I hadn‚Äôt thought of yet!
---
Goldshire is the whole town, if you mean the inn, thats the Lion's Pride Inn. The Inn is not called Goldshire.
---
You know, you don't have to complete it. You can leave after an hour and still have a ton of fun.
---
I started in vanilla but BC came out just before I hit 60, then wotlk came out just before I maxed again lol. I was about 17-18 when I started so I had a job and such and didn't put enough time into it. I'm going to abandon my social life this time around so I can raid max level. Person I lived with at the time was always raiding max level, it looked hella fun.
---
Dude, nothing about vanilla is new. Everything has been done and seen, why would extending the levels in beta do anything but deter those who would leave after 1 month anyways?
---
Just make sure that you get a good wand. I think you can get the Greater Magic Wand at level 13, and it makes a huge difference.
---
Fear can help your survivability, too. You can let your void tank a mob while another is running around in terror, and both are quickly dropping from dots. You may even be able to keep a third dying with fear juggling, although that can be mana intensive.
---
That was due to the lack of space on the building lots but i couldnt miss adding the crystal lake üíô
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying...
---
I wouldn't say "only".  But, that is very likely going to be the case.  Being able to buy mounts from other races requires a higher reputation with them, which can only be done by completing quests that award reputation towards that race.  So, it's pretty unlikely that you would have high enough reputation with another race to buy their mount right at 40.  You might be revered with one other race by the time you hit 40, but not all of the races of your faction.
---
Haha in years of vanilla play I never made that specific connection
---
Ew. I did add some floor stains tho.
---
This is realest take in raiding tbh. It persists today until retail. Me and a couple of my friends parse high 90s consistantly but some of our buddies we bring are lucky to break 20. We clear because it evens out, but yeah half of raiding is just carrying lol
---
It was indeed! I misread, sorry
---
If this was a new game, not only would I ask for 12+ hours, I'd ask or 12+ day long battles. That's more more epic than the quick 15 minute repetitive battles that focus on instant gratification rather than fun.
---
Well yeah, but most importantly you express your feelings with them anyway? I really don't see what's wrong with using LULW or LUL instead of laughing my fucking ass off.
---
Holy shit. That‚Äôs a significant jump
---
I didnt mean the inn, I meant exactly what I said. It looks like the fishing house out behind Goldshire. I even said it looked pretty decent. No need to downvote me for clarifying where the building is for other people.
---
For speed leveling you should always go to Darkshore. The zone is quite empty and the quests are less spread out.
---
CTmod was the best. Auto opening mail was pretty much all it needed to be the best. Plus chat input bar moved to top.
---
in vanilla, only 2% of people raided at all!
---
It's somthing
---
In addition to getting attuned for raids, you'll likely want to farm reputation with certain factions (I'm specifically thinking of the Argent Dawn).
---
Nonsense just get a really shity Mike and you can be the Kenny to our South Park
---
Ok thank you. Once I get the gear, is it viable to heal while shadow specced, but still having healing gear?
---
what the hell is VC is it a typo or wailing caverns? 
---
I sure hope that pepe poggers pog will stay out of wow chat.
---
This doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all dude. There‚Äôs YouTube videos of him showing off this icc drake during wotlk. So your claiming he played vanilla servers before wotlk when they probably didn‚Äôt even exist? K
---
Then solution should have been to make the rewards more valuable, not to stunt the entire battleground for the sake of quick rewards.
---
Still the best rogue armor, and always used as at least a base in every transmog set I use. I would love if they‚Äôd remake in with higher detail.
---
Wait, 7 players?
---
Respec is ernt....
---
Asmongold and Tipsout ofc ! /s
---
I can't watch Twitch, my DSL connection is not fast enough, but on YouTube I find Preach(1) and Swifty chill dudes.
---
Venruki is OK too.
---
Sonii is probably too loud for your tastes, but I found his 2 "RP-PVP" videos excellent (his hair though :D ).
---
(1) If you want to play a warrior and want to learn the basics of tanking go watch Preach 2 or 3 first classic videos (he goes in RFC, WC and SFK), he gives great advices, he's an excellent tank.
---
"Kinda"
---
are you knowledgeable about laptops? I am wondering what the cheapest laptop I could get to run Classic would be.
---
You rule lol
---
It certainly can make it much much more challenging. If we're talking about content that is trivial to X amount of characters, then of course there is no challenge. However if we're talking about content that challenges a group, then it is absolutely more challenging to multibox it than complete it in a group of players where you're only controlling one character each.
---
A lot of those addons drastically alter the vanilla experience.
---
20-30 helm, 30-40 necks, 40-50 trinkets, 50-60 end game gear starts showing up.  Obviously there are exceptions. It's a natural progression and very simple but so genius.
---
Tanking everything and getting crazy geared on a server I know will last for once.
---
twitch chat applies to the large majority of the modern gaming community
---
Will do. Thank you
---
Sorry I‚Äôm grouchy lol
---
I don't think this is a great representation of what classic will be. Those that got invited to beta are generally more tryhard than the average player and tryhards love warriors (source: am tryhard, love warriors).
---
3 min CD  and viper gets spammed on you. Better to go poison pots either way, but I hear ya. It's a nice perk.  Desperate prayer is 10 min CD too, so it can either be clutch hell yes, or ...well fuck. :)
---
1. Playing with real-life friends. 
---
2. Feeling like my in-game achievements mean something.
---
3. Knowing the meta beforehand, knowing it won't  change (this has a loot of negative sides, too but it is exciting for me)
---
4. Playing the same game I've played for thousands of hours years ago but this time being way better at it from the start.
---
Oh yeah, Rhok'Delar is certainly a crazy good weapon, no doubt about it. 
---
And it's true you shouldn't expect to ever see Nerubian Slavemaker. Just wanted to add that that is how you progress as a Hunter, and that for most people, the Crossbow of Smiting (BWL Xbow) is going to be the end-all be-all. I'm actually not certain how Troll/Dwarf racials factor into the equation - maybe those races can get upgrades from AQ.
---
Common language for the twitch generation, and it pisses me of so hard. "Get off my lawn!"
---
Yeah, would make for an awkward gearing process in phase 1
---
He started playing in Vanilla 1.12. He has shown screenshots of his Warrior in Vanilla and TBC.
---
NO
---
I don't know what that is, but it's not Goldshire. Nice job though.
---
Yeah I did that and it was nice.
---
Part of me doubts that going to 11 zones (zone repeats) from 20-30 is going to be optimal, but I know he has practiced it so I've been doing it (But with no competition in beta currently, it doesn't feel authentic.)
---
druids are fun for exploring since you can travel form and aquatic form and cat form, good at soloing. Also good for doing dungeons since you can fill any role. I guess it depends what you like doing, though.
---
Send him a whisper or go contact him directly. This sub has nothing to do with whoever that is.
---
It is, its just not the inn :)
---
Not that you're wrong, or not able to have a valid point, but may I offer you an argument? This is unequivocally the same as when other generations made L33T5P34K. The older generations probably barely understood it and thought they were talking to toddlers as well. I personally never used either, but it's just a fad. I'm trying to self-deny bieng that old man telling at people to stay off my lawn.
---
I've mentioned this a few times on this sub, but they just need to make an old AV bg weekend. Have the 1.12 AV as the default, but every once in a while drop the old AV for a few days to a week. I feel like that makes everyone happy, and it shouldn't be that hard to do. Take that with a grain of salt though, since I know absolutely nothing about programming an instance in an MMO.
---
Nah people started calling it VC or Mines on my server not long after Dire Maul came out. That‚Äôs years before wrath...
---
Considering how messy the add-ons were, it's an amazing interface for that time !
---
Weapon skill reduces parry rate (not by much), block rate and dodge rate. Also increases damage via glancing blows. Druids have no way to increase weapon skill.
---
It will also affect warriors in the pserver meta because on pserver DW tanks are all the rage, they won‚Äôt be with 14% parry rate.
---
 I don‚Äôt hurry anywhere, no instructions, I want to - I catch fish, I want to - I‚Äôll look for someone to fill VanCleef‚Äôs face and so on. so that everything is interesting and memorable.
---
For the people who have done it before, its easy, because experience counts for everything on these fights
---
For brand new raids of people who have never done them? I think Ony is kind of tough, but with little clearing, most guilds should able to do it in a night with reading strats. MC should be 2 raid sessions, most bosses are pretty easy, but an unorganized guild thats never raided before will probably still wipe quite a few times on their first attempts.
---
Most of BWL will be pretty tough for a guild with no experience. By the time AQ40 rolls around though, your guild should have gelled and know raids pretty well. C'Thun is a really hard boss though for any guild.
---
I was originally going to play lock actually, but something about the playstyle just wasn't fitting me. I randomly decided to try priest since it's the only class I've never played, and I like it wayyyy better. I like the dots, but Locks just seem to have way too much ramp up time. They also seem incredibly boring in pve just spamming Shadowbolt.
---
So far it seems I may just go holy and try to get a decent set of shadow and healing gear, and eventually just be a shadow priest for PvP and swap out for healing gear and heal with the same spec. Obviously not the best of the best but I think I'll enjoy that better.
---
Whenever *I* liked it best

Where do you imagine they are getting data from which is used to make decisions? Ouija board?

best social addon in a 40 men guild-raid environment and the most fun youll ever have ingame, especially when you added your own soundfiles and shared them with your friends. 
---
Imagine raiding with your traditional sitcom "applause" in discord and Al Bundy one liners and every time the overly motivated and annoying offtank dies to a Lavapack you hear Elton John's candle in the wind....
---
Ah best times i ever had in WoW....
---
At minimum something with Ryzen CPU with Vega 8 integrated graphics or a laptop with MX150. For best value you could look for sales of laptops with GTX 1050Ti, or even 1050 if the price is low enough. More gaming pick would be a laptop with GTX 1060 but that won't be among cheap options. Also sometimes previous gen is still available (GTX 900 Maxwell) in like leftover Clevo laptops at local boutique Clevo sellers - that could also be a nice option.
---
This is a very cool collection but man a lot of that chat is toxic.
---
IIRC, WotF initially lasted some ridiculous duration, like 20s. The 1.12 version can be activated while being disabled and gives you a buff that lasts 5s.
---
Here is an example of a deprecated quest that looks the same on BFA and Classic. The only difference is that the quest is hidden by default in search results on the BFA site. The quest was flagged by Blizzard. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=5253/deprecated-the-crystal-of-zin-malor
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5253/deprecated-the-crystal-of-zin-malor
---
As this quest is in the level 50 range, and cannot be datamined in advance like items and spells, it will be updated whenever the beta level cap increases and someone uploads data with the Wowhead Client.
---
There has been some manual work done to the database over the years, but when the Classic branch was set up, we did not carry over any of the manual customizations to the Classic site.
---
A leveling experience doesn't feel right without a Deadmines clear on Alliance!
---
Yes haha so good
---
I didn‚Äôt realize, I thought it was like 50gold a respec or something ridiculous like that?
---
im exited about old pre-cata locations ,specially [this](https://external-preview.redd.it/V6tWU9qIxR6P6i4bMgSp59Q745QvsKwvlbLvBAIgIjo.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7026470c0f11c991a62db876c77d81835c564830)

And people still wipe in LFR to the occasional must perform mechanic (which Vanilla has). So expect wipes sometimes in vanilla.
---
The Gods decide, not us

I feel like I'm the only one whose recount doesn't work on Beta. I get a LUA error when I login, and it won't record any of the data. (I have the recount box open too and have tried resetting.)

Even in full healing gear as shadow you can't viably heal AQ and naxx?

Not fat, but manly.
---
This. If your raid guild is competitive and won't allow you to raid as an arms warrior, and you genuinely care about PvP, you're going to need to respec. "2H Fury" is not a legitimate PvP spec. Mortal Strike is what makes PvP warriors good. 
---
Like, once 2.5 and 3 come out and you're massively overgeared, maybe you can gank kids out in the open world, but you're not going to be an asset to a PvP team running around slamming players, lol.
---
maybe you should ask him?
---
I've never leveled on the horde side at all :\\
---
Yeah no doubt people will still die to dumb stuff. But dont expect to do 600 wipes on a boss like in retail progression
---
It's a bad thing when any game judges PvP rank based almost strictly on time played, not skill, efficiency, or literally any other merit-based metric.
---
I only ever ran it in Vanilla, and it was called VC.
---
That still doesnt invalidate my original point. This is the fishing house behind Goldshire, not Goldshire proper. Goldshire is the town square with the inn, blacksmith, and vendor cart. I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick, but I am definitely going to defend my point when I know I‚Äôm right.

I'd rather carry a bag of soul shards than a bag of arrows, and then pet food on top of that.

If you're going into a channel with 10-50k viewers you are basically trying to talk to a sports stadium worth of people, what do you expect.

There's plenty of channels that have great chat experiences in the 100-1000 viewer range. Not every one of them, but they are not exactly hard to find either.
---
Noice
---
Yep. Everyone says pog/poggers/pogchamp/kappa outside of twitch now. It‚Äôs real dumb
---
Fuck em
---
Warsong-us vanilla day 1, we called it VC. I distinctly remember because I didn't know the bosses name was van Cleef but I knew there was an instance called deadmines. This is before dire maul existed. I had to ask what vc was and someone explained it was named after the last boss. Not sure why people called it vc instead of dm, but they did. I think van Cleef was just kind of catchy. Most people didn't even refer to the instance as dead mines, people just called it van Cleef.
---
It‚Äôs quite interesting how many people are torn between Priest and Warlock. I‚Äôm in the same shoes, though I want to play as a healer if I end up as a Priest.
---
Am Warrior
---
Great, that seals it, now I‚Äôll never level on the Alliance side.
---
Once a Horde always a Horde.
---
you wouldn't want it on gouge as a rogue, or maybe intimidating shout as a warrior, since it would break the CC you just applied.
---
Other than that I think it's fine.
---
I remember that in vanilla, it acted like this anyway - e.g. sinister strike would turn on your autoattack. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong?
---
I don't have access to the beta, but I have personally never liked Recount. Give Details a shot [https://willitclassic.com/view/43uT7HeVlnHUT3MntBCP](https://willitclassic.com/view/43uT7HeVlnHUT3MntBCP)  Although. . I know its alpha. . so I am not sure how much of it works either.  But it's worth a shot.
---
Also, make sure you check the place you downloaded the mod from regularly. . A lot of the authors are releasing updated regularly. Sometimes multiple times a day.
---
Big if true
---
I started playing in 2004.  My server called it VC ever since DM rolled out.
---
It's armor in a slot that was most likely empty before you finished the quest.  You already had boots, so the upgrades are similar.
---
How else would you get a mount?
---
Day 1 vanilla player here and everyone on warsong called it vc from day 1.
---
What are you defending when no ones attacking you? I rebuilt the blacksmith and the inn too, dont worry, but that i added the crystal lake and the fishing house, doesnt make it a different town.
---
Youll probably be better off in the long run.  Theyll have to do it all in one go instead of over time
---
Not all the guilds, otherwise I wouldnt get to raiding as well. But im not going to force myself sitting on computer farming gold just to afford daily respec. Its 2019, game is on easy mode and there will be guilds, who ll accept different specs. And arms still performs well compared to balance druid or feral or retri or whatever. Play what you want, find semi-casual semi-hardcore guild, who will accept you
---
Loch modan right?
---
Onyxia and MC both have attunements that need to be done before you can do them. There will most likely be tons of groups doing these for the first couple months as people try to get to the raids as soon as they can.
---
Don't use them then
---
Will you chill out?
---
Here I'll revise my statement for you, personally: Running through snowy mountains for 2 to 4 hours while working on professions and questing wears me down.
---
Danmark Repr√¶senter!
---
The real question, who cares?
---
I'm super excited for endgame.
---
Part of the reason I'm rolling paladin is because I know that during the leveling up process I'll be perfectly capable of both tanking and healing. I absolutely love tanking. While I've never healed in dungeons before, i think I'm going to enjoy it.
---
I think that u can get great enjoyment out of leveling professions and if u do than its worth it.
---
&gt;Only if you plan on using axes all the time.
---
Or if you're planning to engage in any kind of PvP.
---
People who make fun of emojis = ü§°

Lonely children who are so desperate for recognition and validation that the minuscule chance of a "famous person" reading and acknowledging their post is, to them, worth the time and effort they spend spamming the chat?

yes) [thats really majestic](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/scarteleu/images/4/4c/LochModan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081028155747)
---
It's boring!
---
I remember getting some enjoyment from AoE grinding in the 40s+ with a prottish spec (probably consecrate and then sanctuary/holy shield when you can get there). I read that this is not as fast as going ret. But it's at least a change of pace...
---
You can also do dungeons (probably filling any role) to break up the monotony.
---
Don't make mounts a major reason for picking race though since you can always grind for them if you really want to.
---
All of them. The "x" youre referring to are called players.
---
As for popularity, Warriors and Rogues tend to be the most popular and have the hardest time getting raid spots. Mages just behind them. Shaman, Paladin and Priests tend to be middling. Hunters and Warlocks tend to be in decent demand and Druids relatively high.
---
It's gonna be so much fun. What are you planning to play?

But what if I like shitposts?
---
Rank 10 was doable for sure. 11+ is where the grind got very real from what I remember. I would run with a group most nights (except for raids) and a good portion of the weekends but I never got past 10, usually hovered between 8 and 9, with slow work weeks bumping to 10 for a week or two.
---
for 5 man, sure
---
for everything else: depends on your guild
---
Get tour flash of light finger ready for endgame lol
---
Tauren females looks great in all armor, plus they aren't flea bags that are always scratching.  Rolled female tauren druid and war.  Getting an interrupt as a druid is great btw.
---
Pepega
---
Yeah, I would much prefer details anyways. I remember atleast in Legion, Recount was actually really bad. It had such false data that everyone had been switching over.
---
Provincial Sales Tax.
---
You could say we absolutely rolled them lol.
---
I‚Äôm defending the fact that it isnt Goldshire in this picture, its a fishing shack. I appreciate that you recreated Goldshire as well, but thats not whats in the picture. This house is not a part of Goldshire, it is a separate entity. The fact that you keep arguing with me on that is the reason I feel the need to defend myself here.
---
Important to note that it's people like you that fan the flames by mentioning it everywhere which help make it worse and more prelevant.
---
It's basically like cheering or chanting in a sports stadium, just more elaborated and opaque for someone who hasn't seen it before.
---
Okay well just because I‚Äôm not a scholar on the history of private servers doesn‚Äôt make his statement any less ridiculous. What‚Äôs he even trying to say? ‚ÄúAsmongold bad. Private server bad. Asmongold play private server!‚Äù 
---
Like okay buddy.
---
I really am enjoying it. I just don‚Äôt want to get left behind when classic comes out ya know.
---
My first thought as well... never cared for 133TSP34K. I tried it back in AOL chatrooms and such in the early 2000s, got over it pretty quick. I don't care for emote-speak either... I hope that trend passes in 5-10 years, and hope that the next trend is a least a little less annoying.
---
Someone may correct me, but if I remember right hunters damage does drop off around naxx? That said, I remember hunters being perfectly viable for raiding, and required for tranq shot. They are also a great solo class and good for farming. My opinion is that there will be lots of mid-tier raiding guilds who won't turn down an active player. If that's what you want to play, you'll be fine.
---
At this rate I‚Äôll have a few hundred gold at 40 and probably 1k at 60.

---
Loved this one so much as a Mage main.
---
Big shout-out to Faxmonkey too!
---
Maybe for teenagers.  Everyone I know who's a gamer actually plays games, rather than just watching (and giving money to) other people playing them.
---
 Nothing better than a crew of decked out dwarves! Their charge emote was my favorite thing to yell when pulling mobs.
---
Pretty much. The spotted and striped nightsabers look cool
---
Compare how long will you spend levelling and how long you will spend at lvl 60 (potentially years if Bliz doesn't fuck-up).
---
Levelling doesn't account at all in my choice of a class.
---
Ye so its 24:00 on 26 aug? (CET)
---
I mean every generation has its "oh Jesus why" trends. 
---
We went from 1337speak and then "lolcats" were a whole thing. 
---
TBH I cringe at the "aw heck that dog did a zoomie" baby talk.
---
Before there was Lothos Riftwalker, you had to clear through BRD to the MC entrance.
---
I also raided URBS back in the day with waaay more than 5.  And yes, we wiped.
---
Lol true
---
I doubt they will. It will kill the hype for 60 and world firsts
---
They stopped using WC3 assets very early on in the development cycle. You should read John Stat's book, The WoW Diary. It's fantastic.
---
More than this i am not sure if you can still buy wow tokens and sell them for in game gold. if you can and they sort of settle at 200g or so its no big deal but if you can get 1000 or 2000g for a token it also is a bit economy destroying
---
Yup. Early in Vanilla you could take 10 players to dungeons and 15 to UBRS/LBRS. (Even earlier it was uncapped and you could take a full 40 if you really wanted)
---
*Citation needed.
---
Some of them were lol. AVI or whatever in ICC era. Healbot and decursive in Vanilla. Those just off the top of my head.
---
I highly doubt he was buying 1000gold for 20$ in vanilla.
---
When I botted in bc, I was selling 1k gold To gold selling websites for 15$  per 1000gold. 
---
There‚Äôs no way that price is correct.
---
Mage is considered by many as the best class in vanilla, as it's simply top tier in every form that the game offers, unlike rogue which is great in some aspects of the game but average in others.
---
I just dont think the demand will be high enough and your population in the casual server will be less than when people leave because they're out of content.
---
I usually had a shaman in groups since they love being able to dps instead of healing.
---
Pros and Cons of rolling Orc Male or Female (Rogue)?
---
This is why I think Twitch is fucking retarded now.  Well, let me clarify, Twitch is fine, but Twitch chat/users are fucking retarded.  I barely ever watch streams anymore, but when I do, I have to turn the chat off, I can't be bothered to see that stream of idiotic nonsense on any remotely popular streamers channel.  Smaller streamers with fewer viewers, or magically, when people put their chat on sub only mode, 95% of the stupidity disappears.
---
the standard emotes weren't satisfactory anymore so people started to make altered versions, zoomed in versions etc. through the BTTV addon with which channels can add their own emotes.
---
LULW is a zoomed in LUL for example.
---
Turn growl off, set your pet to passive, and dismiss pet before jumping off of everything.
---
If you can do those things, and know what gear is actually good for hunters, you'll be welcome in pretty much any 5-man.
---
There will be tons of gold sellers. 100% guaranteed
---
Incorrect assumption. It was called VC before Dire Maul came out. And anyone running Dire Maul would pick a wing, like DME.
---
It was called VC because people wanted to run it to complete the quest they had to kill Van Cleef.
---
Bruh there are much more important things to argue about in this life and the proper initials on a level 18 dungeon is not one of them.
---
Emojis is the best thing to happen to online communication. b4 all we had were :P an xD
---
I plan on taking time out to level fishing and making money that way. Those alchemy fish go for a fair penny.
---
Ahh, I liked this one. Ultimately ran into problems when people at the bottom of the list showed up to raid but clearly wanted to sit for the night to "allow others in".  Not a problem itself, but when we're all in Silithus and they are still in Org, it becomes a problem.  Requires a lot of like minded people but probably the most fair.
---
 #/s?
---
Thank you very much for this information. I have one last question ‚Äî on the off chance I got a MacBook Air, do you think it would run? It says on their website that it has an Intel UHD Graphics 617.
---
Which fish would that be? The ones I‚Äôm not cooking with I‚Äôve been vendoring.
---
I was never broke in Classic. I bought thousands of gold and even level boosts on separate accounts.
---
Here is my playlist
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2eivc8LCBQgLvE4UKFSFUu?si=zeNDiHb4R8mj2C5CLHQScw
---
Heh.
---
I decided to do the same. As a Night elf, in the Timbermaw cave, the ground was literally covered in Night Elfs and every few seconds you'd see someone try to run and die. Of course the spawn rate was a bit high but still a good time
---
Gotcha, it‚Äôs not the constant posts about them, it‚Äôs me, with my lone single comment about the state of this sub.
---
Logging on right as it launches and seeing a horde of level 1 players on a fresh server and experience everyone starting from a level field. It'll be something to remember.
---
Currently playing on a private server cause you know....no beta....funny thing, those were my first shoulders!
---
That makes sense, thanks for putting that out there. My family loves the show, but this topic is come up the other night for a time. I think that I‚Äôll pass that along.
---
Invest in peons4hire and Susan gaming stock
---
There were gold sellers in Vanilla too
---
1 year or never, there is rank decay, you have to play every day..
---
It is all gamers in their late twenties to forties - it's the equivalent of your dad not understanding those phases you went through as a teenager.
---
But to be fair, a lot of twitch communities are pretty toxic, so it's easy to see why people don't care for it.
---
I'm gonna be playing paladin for the first time, and Ive never ever healed before. Does anyone have any tips for someone with no experience healing? 
---
Also, I do remember that in vanilla your spec in 5 man dungeons wasn't important - if your class could do the role, you could do it regardless of spec, until you got to the higher level content. With that in mind, would going ret til I get seal of casino (and MAYBE the movement speed buff), then putting everything else into holy be a good strategy? 
---
I know I'm going to be doing a ton of soloing, hence the seal of casino, but I also want to be useful in dungeons. Holy has some of the best abilities for group content, at least from my perspective. Illumination is a must have for healing, and consecration is really useful for AoE tanking, or at least looks like it. Is doing that talent spread a good idea, or should I just focus on ret and hope for the best when healing? Or hell, would my soloing speed be bad if I leveling as holy?
---
Hmm. Sorry. Turns out these questions don't seem to be that simple. Haha!
---
Even the dungeons that can be completed in under an hour sometimes take two or three hours of the group is struggling. Some groups will even end up falling apart when gear needs to be repaired and trash needs to respawn.
---
Also, don't forget the time it takes to find a group and travel to the instance.
---
Its easy enough for anyone remotely familiar with shorthand to extrapolate what "lul" means as its close enough to "lol" or "lmao", but what the fuck does "POGGERS" or "POGCHAMP" or "OMEGA" mean?  If you aren't familiar with the retardation that is Twitch chat, you'll be totally in the dark as its all meaningless without that knowledge.
---
FYI  That link does not go to Bestiary images.
---
No. I am not saying that. I am saying that he may started in WotLK or late TBC, then he was playing on some vanilla private server when there was one, so he can claim that he was playing during vanilla etc. Simple as that. Why? Well his memory regarding things in vanilla seems to be very shaky and correct with private servers that are a bit off.
---
This place has turned in to a "Boomer's first meme" reddit.
---
That first BoE world blue drop

Dinging 20 and getting SoC

Dinging 40 and getting your warhorse

Finishing a dungeon with 4-5 quests completed for it and gaining a level from them alone

You play a raid spec while your guild is progressing on content and once it is on farm status you can switch back to PvP spec (you can still show up to raids and DPS as an arms warrior once the content is on farm). There's no such thing in vanilla WoW as being able to optimally PvP and optimally PvE in the same night though. The only reason you see raiders PvP is because for the most part vanilla is "raid-or-die" and players with sub-optimal PvP specs can get by based on outgearing opponents in the open world (most people have blue gear only).
---
That‚Äôs my original thinking, most of what I‚Äôm doing is happening as I quest but I have had to take time to go to forges and train and go back to gold shire/west fall to mine. Hours worth of time.
---
r/cringe
---
Ah, it has the perfect resting place for the sack.
---
Midnight between Monday and Tuesday.
---
Youre gonna gate keeper him on this?
---
I played in Vanilla but my account was hacked in TBC so I made a new one, so now it looks like I started to play in BC
---
Blizz should honestly make a couple servers "authentic" where streamers can't play.
---
Well, now if you have to complain because I use twitch emotes in world chat, you're starting to be picky. To say the least ...
---
Can a warlock effectively AoE farm gold with a mage? Rain of fire seems like a big DPS boost compared to blizzard even though it doesn't have CC.
---
Thank you. I looked up my laptops specs:
---
O/S-Windows10
---
Processor: intel core i5-4200u CPU @ 1.6GHz 2.3GHz
---
Graphics: intel HD graphics 4400
---
Ran: 8GB
---
Think that should be fine? I honestly know nothing about PC specs anymore, my time on them for the past few years is just working with spreadsheets /sigh
---
If u remove the bfa girl it would be more accurate.
---
From what I gather, blizzard's layering is supposed to solve that issue by distributing equal amounts of the faction population per layer, I doubt it's perfect but I guess that'll help a bit.
---
It should be the same for everyone.
---
Go nightelf.  You won't regret it.  I can't even count the amount of times this saved me or won me fights.  Got other stealth friends?  Nice, you now have the ability to ambush people as a group which wins you fights 99.9% of the time in wpvp. 
---
Dwarfs are cool n all but stone skin isn't anywhere near as good as shadow meld.  People who say the difference is negligible are either idiots or haven't actually played a NE with a stealth pet.
---
I totally agree! Seeing my own screenshots made me wonder what kind of gold is buried away out there.
---
Roll for loot council
---
None of them, they all got god complex, think they better then everyone else..
---
Mages are fun levelers. Good kill time, great survivability, can pull big packs and AOE grind, as well as fun in PvP if you're into that. :)
---
Gold sellers will be a thing in Classic. And I will be their best customer.
---
Respec caps at 50g yeah.
---
Not a single class in the game has a single spec that's best for PvE and PvP. Your option is always going to be either choose a compromise spec (as long as it's okay with your guild), or grind 50g every time you want to change specs.
---
If your not putting dps out as a healer especially early on in the expac your doing something wrong
---
Let's try spinning! That's a good trick!
---
It wasn't in vanilla, it shouldn't be now. I choose what addons to use.
---
I know there‚Äôs different prices for different servers. Maybe your server was in high demand or something. 
---
Also, how the heck was that worth your time? $15 for 1000g? How many hours did that take? That‚Äôs 3 hours of working at McDonald‚Äôs.
---
extremely disingenuous and intellectually dishonest retort
---
basically, the jist of it is that by taking podshots and shoehorning it into topics that no one has mentioned it, you are part of the problem and contributing to a toxic environment
---
if you really want the discussion on streamers to end, then be part of the solution by not talking about it, instead of spreading the negativity into places where people are trying to be positive
---
They need testers to test things. This includes content from 40-60. 
---
People in the beta sacrifice this for us. Also there is not as much people in the beta as people think. 
---
People in beta are also those types to do it all over again for real
---
Lolol - can only report spammers and hope blizzard is on top of it.
---
Haha epic meme friend! Remember bfa bad :D
---
My fear for wowclassic is every single guild is going to be basing everything around discord. Reading the comments it seems that way and only OP and I seem to share the opinion that discord is terrible. Reliability is one thing - however privacy and security are my concerns. I really hate discord. It's a terrible electron app to boot. 
---
I'd happily pay ¬£10 or more a month for mumble. My current server only costs me ¬£9 per year.
---
That's a really really weak iGPU (check Pentium J5005 in my benchmarks results - similar iGPU). If you want portable things there are 13,3"-14" options. I've seen old clevos with GTX965M, sometimes 970M plus some newer models either with better Ryzen CPUs or low end Nvidias ;)
---
Yes. And you could always tell who bought gold and who didn‚Äôt.
---
It was at the top for a few hours after beta released, now its back to business as usual, where 5-8 other games are above it at any given time in terms of viewers.
---
Personally, I have no problems with *the streamers themselves*.  Its the Twitch community at large I take issue with.  I don't want to be on a server where 500 people are following a big streamer around and sucking their dick 24/7 and in game chat is just an extension of Twitch chat where its "POGGERS" "OMEGA" and other stupid shit 24/7.  Fuck that shit, give me shitty Chuck Norris jokes.  Make Barrens Chat Great Again.
---
Look at these statistics and straight up tell me this doesn't represent the majority of modern gamers.
---

---
I love that damn dam
---
But I hate those damn ogres on the other side.
---
OK. Thank you again for the information!
---
&gt;tfw have a extra monitor but only have ryzen APU
---
Gold sellers , account boosters ...
---
They all existed back in vanilla so It makes sense they existas in classic aswell
---
A good rule of thumb to know if something is cringe-y: If you saw a greying news anchor doing it and cringe, it probably has the same effect on other people when you do it.
---
Given the fact that a new account costs you literally a sub and a new email, I‚Äôm definitely gonna check the prices for character boosts. I spend my time earning BIG BOY MO EY so I don‚Äôt have to do boring ass shit in old video games.
---
This man put on a challenge for some need without a life
---
I don't think the meanings are inherently different, but rather how they are used. Someone says something funny and you lol and move on; twitch emotes are normally spammed nonstop even with nothing relevant happening.
---
I think I'll like that
---
I've had one of those MMO mouses for years (Logitech g600),so it's gonna be my thumb :)
---
Forgot about the boosted level thing and how obvious it was to see the bots boosting levels. I haven‚Äôt played for over 10 years, so I don‚Äôt know how it is now.
---
There won‚Äôt be WoW tokens in classic.
---
isn't it a bit ridiculous to go through detective work just to figure out if a guy played a computer game 15 years ago? I don't understand why you want asmongold to be a liar so badly, lol
---
Reconnecting with people. A few friends from years back as well as my older brother mentioned wanting to play Classic. While I would much prefer playing something else (like TBC), at the very least it is a social activity to connect with folks I haven't talked to in a while (especially my brother who lives across the country and avoids casual conversation for the most part).
---
You can technically do anything you want. Shortcomings of not being a healer spec will be noticed in those raids tho.
---
I'm so excited for #2 and #3 - also, getting that level 20 quest hammer is gonna be awesome. My friends are gonna try to help me get that the second I turn 20, so if I'm lucky I'll have it by 22 :)
---
Imagine telling people to imagine telling people to imagine stuff
---
So he's inconsistent? I'm sure most Beta-testers are.
---
Source on the hunter's mark stack? 
---
Even without the source, I can pretty much guess it was said in jest or "in character" to be funny. I think people are just finding any silly reason to be mad at streamers because they don't have a key themselves. 
---
Obviously the streamers got the keys to showcase the game and advertise for it, which they have done incredibly well between 100k+ viewer Deadmines runs + Horde Duel tourney and other shenanigans. This is a clear strategy. I've not seen any other marketing for Classic tbh, cause this does the trick.   
---
You can nitpick on Asmon or any other streamer all you want, but it won't change the fact that they'll get a beta next time too, and you probably won't.
---
Didn't they want to remove layering after a few months?
---
This whole sub is a shitshow clown fiesta anti streamer circlejerk. I fail to see how answer your question with honesty is a bad thing. 
---
That *is* what I‚Äôm most excited about, being able to go to a sub where I can discuss my favorite game that isn‚Äôt filled with whining and complaining about what others are doing.
---
Sorry if that‚Äôs the wrong answer,
---
Any chance you have an add-on list? I like the UI
---
He says he botted, so my guess is the time to level the character, maybe an hour or two of setup, then maybe 30 minutes to take control, trade, and get back to the farm spot.  The more sales he made the less the relative time impact.
---
I have an OG account from launch, where it still shows my original login name on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) \- and I can't change my Battletag name without paying. I think rather than do this I'd just rather start completely fresh with no existing characters/expansions.  
---
If I set up a new [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account from scratch, will I have to buy the base game again or can I just subscribe?
---
Enjoyed the video !
---
Dont use them then
---
Only guys who doesn't die from prolonged smackage on their head with the hammer are druids and shamans. So you'll be fine
---
I hope that was a female NE because the males don‚Äôt know how to draw a bow or hold a 2H wep
---
lol true!
---
Average time to reach 60 is something like 10-12 days. You were leveling really slowly, it should be faster this time, I guess lol.
---
My friends used to make fun of me for gathering flowers, but when they came to me for a loan at level 40...
---
Unfortunately I already know, but was hoping otherwise. Why go out and farm for that super rare BOE item when you can just wait for it to pop up on AH and buy it whatever ridiculous someone posts it for? 
---
Inflation is going to be crazy.
---
"Rewriting history"
---
As if it wasn't obvious already the Acronym was different on different servers and regions. Stop pretending like it was always "VC"
---
Running away is the only thing you can do.
---
The best thing about classic is we can actually make some new ones!
---
Dont need to be specd, just keep a set of healing gear with you. Paladin healing in 5 mans is the most simple and most difficult of the healing classes. You only have direct heals, which means time management is key, you have to triage very carefully when theres multiple people taking damage.
---
For leveling, you may as well go all the way ret unless youve got someone to help you AoE farm. If you go for SoC and then Illumination, youll be level 40 by the time you get 5/5. Much better off just sticking with ret.
---
we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know
---
your a UPS driver.
---
If I take a human warrior to the nelf zone, can I do the warrior quest there, or will I have to go all the way back to SW?
---
Troll Priest if horde, Gnome mage if alliance (hard to bring myself to roll dwarf). Might roll something else like druid if there'll be too much overlap with what my friends are rolling but those are my main choices.
---
Definitely not a major reason but if I‚Äôm on the fence between two it could help be a deciding factor.
---
2 years of non BFA and then it doesn't matter - they could do new content or just bring other content to vanilla, just don't increase level cap.
---
Discord imo is horrible. They of course harvest every inch of detail then can glean from you and your PC. It's a spyware nightmare. I avoid it like the plague it is.
---
I joined a guild that seemed cool and wanted to do similar things as me on Discord. Find a NA or EU classic Discord group and have a look üòä
---
Yeah... I can definitely see how this will become the normal now that most of us classic players earn more money and have less time to play.
---
Strat undead will have real bad loot tables at launch too.  Waiting until 60 is the best advice.
---
Crushing gold sellers and buyers was one done private servers did really well.
---
Lol üôà
---
I agree. Increasing the level cap is a way to instant render all existing endgame content useless.
---
Thinking small, inconsequential things done by somebody else that don't affect you in any way at all are "kinda cringy" is "kinda cringy" don't you think?
---
First place gonna in classic
---
Not necessarily. I can't abandon my transmog lifestyle!
---
It's part of the appeal of being part of a collective, something larger than yourself and to share your enjoyment of something with others experiencing the same thing as you.
---
It's the same as people typing roflmao or epic win or 1337. You're probably just too jaded to realize culture evolves with time.
---
Horde in Vanilla, Horde in Classic.  If I wasn't rolling a shaman, is totally go Alliance though.  I feel emotionally more connected to them.
---
How the fuck is spamming LULW when something funny happens not relevant. I was using lol when I was 12 back in the actual vanilla, now I prefer Twitch emotes.
---
Imagine calling something retardation just because you don't enjoy it. What a fucking loser can you be, seriously. Fucking normie not even knowing what he's talking about.
---
And riding circles round your comrades who are still saving!
---
Did you ever hear the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Idk about you, but a picture of a very nervous frog with sweat dripping down the side if its face means a lot more than "laugh out loud" to me at an instant.
---
Oh good, one of the "future content posts" haven't seen this in hours!
---
Lame
---
It's part of the appeal of being part of a collective, something larger than yourself and to share your enjoyment of something with others experiencing the same thing as you by communicating in a unique way.
---
I remember when doing the grind way back in vanilla, we had dedicated premades on our side that followed rules to determine who would be the next R14. 
---
However, one dude paid a chinese farmer to play his char non-stop, this guy was in every game, was pretty average, and through sheer force of will and playing time, this guy got R13 in direct competition with our premades. 
---
In the worst case scenario, if you're anti-social, and willing to play 18 hours a day, you can bypass the premades. Anyone with a 9-5 job, there's no way you can do it without account sharing. 
---
The only remotely conceivable situation I can think of someone getting close would be, in Phase 1, farm Hillsbrad non-stop, then when WSG drops, do that non-stop, and you might leap frog the competition early before enough people finish leveling / catch up. 
---
But basically, you're looking at 1 rank per week from about 8-9 to 14, optimally.
---
old macros (patch 1.x-1.12) are irrelevant as classic runs the 8.x core. Lua commands from retail are present and correct so you won't have to use the old scripts to get your macros to do what you want them to do
---
Rain of fire does significantly less DPS than blizzard. But sure a warlock and mage could aoe farm together.
---
I‚Äôm excited to get known on the server for tanking pug BRD runs to the point of physical illness in my relentless pursuit of ironfoe.
---
Lol arsenic and homemade lemonade take start the RP rouge early
---
My 3 friends and i are making a guild and doing loot council. 7 members which will consist of the 4 of us and 3 random raid members. The 3 random will be interchanged every week. We want to keep a majority vote between us if we really think gear should go to a certain person to make the guild better as a whole. The 3 randoms are really for deciding when the four of us disagree with each other.
---
On the side i will have an excel sheet. First column will be everyones name. Second column and onwards will be the week 1, 2, 3 etc. Then just fill in who got what gear at which week. This way ill know who is getting to much or who is getting very little. Highlight a person on the week they also dont show up or cant attend.
---
It wouldn't be vanilla with out....
---
W W W . S U S A N E X P R E S S . C O M

spammed in general
---
Several were unique and gave me a you a dangerous feeling, my favorite was the inside of Blackrock Mountain, I'll never forget entering for the first time and seeing the chains/magma
---
I've also always loved Dire Maul, Maraudon and Sunken Temple entrances
---
God, using "honesty" as an excuse to bitch and say whatever garbage pops into your head is the worst. Your posts are dripping with outright and passive aggression - do you really need to try to infect other people with your unhappiness? 
---
Like, i really shouldn't be taking the bait. Replying to post like yours just brings the whole discussion downward. If you are so unhappy about what other people are talking about when it comes to classic, why don't you, ya know, not join the discussion? 
---
If you made yourself to busy to complain about other people complaining, you wouldn't have to worry about people being disgruntled about streamers. 
---
If you stopped Reading when other people bitch about not being in the beta, you wouldn't get annoyed by it
---
You'd be much happier if you didn't browse this sub and didn't go on other places where people discuss the game. That would be better for everyone else too, since you wouldn't be injecting your negativity everywhere.
---
The endgame content will have to be rendered useless at some point. Youre new to The game? Well before you can join you have to clear The 80 raids that came before....
---
if someone hits me with a poggies i know exactly what they mean, it makes sense outside of twitch.
---
Curious as to why I'm getting negged for offering an explanation. 
---
Ah well, salty betches be salty.
---
Yeah. I'm mainly going to PvP honestly, but of course PvE for gear as well. I guess I may have to rethink Lock vs priest if what everyone says is true and they aren't exaggerating. There won't be anything worse than hitting 60, having to heal only and in holy spec, and not getting any shadow gear so that I basically have to heal all the time.
---
How good do they scale?
---
I usually play addon releases to enjoy AV with NPCs that actually 2-3 shot you and hence stop the immediate rushing.
---
Is it on the same scale, or are the NPCs just scaling enough to not be solo-able at e.g. GYs?
---
You can hear the dev team discussion started, ‚ÄúWe want something that you can‚Äôt miss... so a hunter can  mark a target for a party or raid, give us your best ideas.‚Äù
---
Although, on a PvP server it doesn‚Äôt just mark the hunters target.
---
Probably an average of 10-12 days. A good portion of people who previously leveled on a p server players will probably be under a week played.

You‚Äôll be able to simply subscribe. No expansion fees to worry about.

Foolproof.
---
I saw same names as well. Can't remember the server though.
---
Lol. Offering an explanation deserves negs? You guys are salty AF. ü§£
---
&gt;Considering he has consistently been gladiator rank since BC
---
Yeah right.
---
Thats dark. But w.e you gotta do man. Classic only comes twice

does bitching about other people bitching make you feel better

First person will be a hunter and I am guessing around 4.5 days played time

Thinking of playing Paladin still as I enjoy their class fantasy and all that, plus I've played Paladin for a long time as well. That or Mage. If I go Paladin, was planning on going something like 21/0/30 or 20/0/31 (Don't know how key getting the 2min CD instant crit talent is), or possibly even throwing a few points into Prot to get something there like Kings. I know I'd primarily be healing/buffing in PvE but I figure this way I can also deal some damage every now and again, and ideally also gear my Ret spec this way for PvP which I do plan on working on as well. However one of my big caveats is that I do not want to wear cloth robes. I'm OK with getting plate/mail/leather pieces that have +healing/crit/int/etc. on them but for me personally having to wear robes (and to some degree cloth in general) on a Paladin kills it for me. Wondering how viable this plan is. I don't plan on going hardcore into raiding, fairly casual overall, though I imagine eventually I'd be able to get to AQ/Naxx and such eventually, primarily healing but again providing some off-dps as well when needed. Looking for input into this plan I have to asses viability of it. All thoughts are appreciated.
---
&gt;And you could always tell who bought gold and who didn‚Äôt.
---
There was a shitload of people who spent at least some money on gold buying to get their epic mount and didn't buy any further gold.  It was such a competitively disadvantage not to have an epic mount when it come to farming and making gold in general that it had widespread appeal.
---
Resurrected my photobucket account after seeing people here do it - dumbass high school me only used it to upload pictures of me and my ex and like desktop backgrounds for some reason.  I was really hoping for some screenshots :(
---
Well you used "VC", you get what you earned.
---
Getting PTSD flashbacks of that place
---
Infras google spreadsheet has a section on mage spells worth buying ```goo.gl/24k5Zs```
---
I honestly can't remember.  I know I started August 05 though.
---
TBC is were they nailed the class balance/flavor. (in my opinion)
---
Is this even a question?
---
Female character is always best unlesd you're undead, then its a toss up as either are nice.
---
Those instances often have quests that you can do in the areas leading to the instances. DM and Gnomer are the best in those regards, although WC and BFD also have some quest stuff you can work on outside the instance.
---
I think that the area outside of the Deadmines, and the quests leading up to it, are my favorite.
---
I really like the Blackrock entrances, too.
---
Explain my downvote  :(
---
Also i feel you just exlained its value.
---
You want to do it so do it.
---
the fuck else do you expect in a chat of 30000 people
---
VC? I thought it was DM
---
Smite priest definitely does the best damage of all the heal specs by a fair bit.
---
No changes ? No changes
---
Yeah never put more than 1 point in improved shield block. It's actually a waste of points.
---
Improved shield block - 1 point increases shield block charges by 1 and increases duration by 1 second I think.
---
Improved shield block points 2 and 3 are just increased duration by 2 and 3 seconds. Literally worthless. Your shield block will hopefully never expire because of time. It should use up the charges fast 
---
Improved taunt is probably the route I'd go if I were going to take points out of anticipation.
---
Orcs are ugly
---
The meme specs add replay value to the game. When you've reached the pinnacle of WoW, where you're part of a guild that is clearing AQ40/Naxx, you're going to need a new project or else you'll get bored and quit. Why not roll a meme spec and deck them out with the best gear? They're not as bad as people make them out to be, by the way.
---
Shhh don‚Äôt break the Druid parry circlejerk.
---
That spec will be completely fine for everything in the game. The only thing you'll miss out on is kings.
---
As for healing tips, a paladin primarily spams Flash of Light for consistent spot healing, and maybe judging wisdom occasionally. What will set you apart from other paladins and healers is precasting. A good example is when you know a tank is about to take a big hit, such as a breath attack, so you divine favor and start casting holy light so that it lands right after the tank takes damage. This ensures that the tank doesn't die from an unlucky damage spike. But honestly, even just spamming Flash of Light on people taking damage will be enough 90% of the time. Paladins are probably the easiest healer to play in vanilla as they don't need to worry about threat or mana as much as other healers. As long as you're wearing int gear and casting heals, you'll get a raid spot.
---
Imagine imagining this much.
---
There will be plenty of old man guilds for you to join
---
Maybe I worded this poorly. I'm not necessarily asking about future content specifically, I wanted more to have a discussion about class balance and how people feel about it in 1.12. I'd want to see a lot of memespecs become more viable, without homogenizing everything.
---
Mumble is super lightweight so I recommend just getting a dirt-cheap web server and throwing it on there.
---
Classic raiding will be a complete joke compared to overtuned private server raids.
---
Did you read the comment you're replying to?
---
Can't wait to see people like you be perma-banned for harrasement :)
---
What'd be wrong with that?
---
what do you think
---
Raiders would prob continue playing for raids that take advantage of certain elemental gear and boss-specific gear loot (example: the onxyia cape required for BWL). There‚Äôs a way in Vanilla to continue raiding past T3 without making other content non-viable. 
---
The reason people are nostalgic for Vanilla is because everything seemed to serve a purpose and nothing was made outdated to the player base interested.
---
That seems easy enough. The only one thing buried in that awful ‚Äúinfographic‚Äù that was relevant was the claim that twitch has 15 million regular viewers worldwide. 
---
Given that the total number of gamers is around two billion, it seems clear enough that twitch is a very tiny niche thing indeed.
---
World chat doesn't exist in Vanilla thankfully. Only World Defense which IIRC requires rank 6 to post in.
---
You're that guy who tries to have conversations with people everyone around him in a sports arena.
---
*if pvp is important to you
---
In that case. Yes I‚Äôd agree
---
Absolutely nothing in here compares numbers of twitch viewers to total number of modern gamers.
---
You‚Äôre.
---
Who tf cares.  
---
You guys need to get over your hate boner and just ignore the guy.
---
I agree, I think some of the TBC talent/ability changes would go a long way to making "bad" specs more viable in classic. I'm not even saying bring over full 41pt trees, but things like redoubt for prot pal in TBC make way more sense than the vanilla version of the same talent.
---
Hahaha. That's great!
---
That's a huge time investment man. Props to you
---
It's funny seeing who the young people are by defending this.
---
News flash, even people that spoke leet and spammed shit like omgwtfbbq back in the day looked like doofuses.
---
It wouldn't be so dumb if the twitch lingo was mixed in with coherent sentences but it is just spamming one word.
---
In Twitch shit with thounsands? Okay, not much else you can do, I get it.
---
In a games chat where your voice is louder? Step your vocab up, even if it includes shit like in the OP picture.
---
Honestly rather see someone talk in leet though. It's like they actually took the time to appear like hardcore nerds instead of repeating 3 words.

Looking for any advice, mainly any tips on targeting the mobs that I lose aggro to and how to get aggro from mobs that spawn or appear.
---
So far I'm doing pretty good maintaining aggro with the basic rotation from an old post I found:
---
Pull &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Shield Block &gt; Revenge MT &gt; Sunder Armour MT &gt; Battle Shout x1 or x2 &gt; Sunder Armour adds
---
Which is working for me for 2 or 3 guys but I'm having trouble getting aggro from either mobs that appear like the patrol or VC adds for example. 
---
Any advice very much appreciated.
---
It's about 400-500 for a 1-60 boost which is nuts.

---
The statistic of the number of broadcasters per month compared to a quick search of steam users doesn't extrapolate that information for you?
---
It could go either way depending on the group. Some people might really want those drops and would rather give you gold and vice Versa, won‚Äôt hurt to offer both options if you‚Äôre trying to be nice and willing to work together.
---
A good reputation will go farther than 3 gold

On a more serious note - being "holy" or "ret" doesn't guarantee that you are going to kill anyone. For PvP you want seal of command and kill people with total RNG or by finishing them off with judgement of command on top of HoJ. Without SoComm your options are limited to continuously autoattacking your opponent for basically no spikes of damage. 
---
If he manages to get away - he is free. If he doesn't - usually you kill him (unless you somehow run out of mana or get interrupted badly), that's just how paladins are, no matter the "spec". 
---
And no one can beat mage polymorphing and running away. There is just no counter to that.

If you plan on doing PVP at 60 would the gear you wanna get be the same as your pre raid best in slots or is there a seperate list of gear that's better for pvp and not pve? Thanks
---
Thid was since the announcement 2 years ago. And well its not even really wacthing. Mainly listening to it on the background while i do some stuff
---
Probably will be through battle net but it‚Äôs own smaller download
---
I started playing in BC. Joined my first DM run with mostly white gear and a party member traded me a pair of shoulders since I had none. I explained it was my first character and the whole group was really nice. I wish I had added them to my friendslist
---
We ought to be grateful our minds have been spared - we do not know the horrors those jello heads watching twitch must endure! Poor, poor bastards...
---
Anything thats not frost school,buffs food and poly you can live without
---
They ain‚Äôt even fixed that in retail lol, I get stuck on everything
---
If you are playing high-level premade PvP having paladins more than makes up for the worse racials.
---
Even more so in PvE.
---
So if you are min-maxing that hard there's almost never a reason to play horde let alone Orc unless you only play solo..
---
It's them youngsters with their acronyms slang, back in my days you typed things out properly, like "That's pretty funny!" or "Hilarious!", not saying silly things like lol or lmao.
---
Damn kids!
---
Surely you can figure it out.
---
Well i dont like having a second character, i rather stick to a main. And rerolling in classic i probably wouldnt
---
Brilliant, thank you for the info!

VC on stormreaver for sure.

Oh dude. 4 strength 4 stam leather belt. AHA UGGGGGGGGH UGHHHHHHHHHH

They just feel really clunky with all the shapeshifting. Im fine with it to some extent but having to shapeshift to consume potions and stuff like that really bothers me a lot

Heh Heh.

Read OP before replying maybe?
---
Haha own3d!
---
&gt; I would like Classic to be as bug-free and as close to original vanilla as possible. 
---
Original vanilla wasn't really known for being bug-free.
---
The ones that they can't replicate on their internal 1.12 client will be fixed.
---
Separate client which appears to be around 7 gigs.
---
That's gonna be the best part. I have a similar thing going on with the group of friends I'm gonna be playing with. 
---
We have all been friends since we were kids, but we're all adults now and just dont have the same ability to socialize like we use to. Some of us have kids. Some of us have moved across the country. We all have Adult Jobs. But wow classic is something we're all gonna love, and it's gonna give us the ability to have fun together like we use to.
---
My favorite part of vanilla was always the community. You made good online pals. And having my real world friends there too is gonna be great.

I'm super excited.

Hell no. The game starts at 60 for me. Leveling in classic is cool and all at least compared to now but nah, to never reach mac level i would rather play other games tbh

Did someone say Thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker?
---
Say what you want about twitch emotes, they do allow you to express a lot of emotions with only one word.

It is a good thing for internet. If you expect maturity on the internet and especially WOW, you have come to the wrong place.

Why are they always best? Gimme ur points

Even if that did happen, which i won't, $15 is a small price to pay to keep streamers and their spergs off our server.

However, I was more asking about healing when I'm leveling up. I know how raid healing works but it's hard to find information on healing in 5 man's while leveling.
---
How did that work btw? Would you log out to sleep then log back in an be in AV? Or did people really fight for 3 days lol
---
Not gonna happen - there will always backsliding, just like there will always be progress. Just learn to ignore the idiots. They will be blabbing their nonsense, nothing anyone can do.

It‚Äôs adorable when kids think that ‚Äúboomer‚Äù means anyone older than 20.

Right now no classic database site does something I wish they could do (I think), which is filter out items based on each stage. Like during stage 1 I want to only see items that will currently be available if I choose.
---
Also, water is a terrible lubricant
---
&gt; Btw
---
What does this mean, you youngsters always use these stupid acronyms to talk to each other, speak properly like we did back in my days!
---
&gt;Also do not zoom out to the point where your character is a blob, and do not mess up the ui by a fckton of add-ons that turn the game to a walking button and hp bar manager, ruining your experience.
---
Really not looking for beginner tips since im not one. And i disagree anyway.

I'm not sure if you understand what a beta is for if you have to ask this.
---
It's a good argument but I agree with him. It was a platform to launch BC and although it released before you could enter Outlands I agree that the patch was inherently a BC patch.  1.12.1 was the End of Vanilla eventhough there were changes in preparation of the BC launch.
---
Leveling a shaman casually as enhance is a great idea. It's a fun leveling spec. If you expect raid spot as enhance, though, you'll probably be disappointed. It's not just that enhance is a horrible raid spec, which it is, but most shaman players in their hearts, remember when they did decent damage while leveling up and might want to do damage in raids. So if you let one shaman so his horrible dps, it will start guild drama as half the shams stop wanting to heal. It's much better to just say shamans are healers.
---
And they are good healers, but all their damage specs are trash tier dps
---
Howdy!
---
Are you sure that was in vanilla, and not just a private server thing?
---
I'm 24 and I think once you hit the stage where you use your age and unwillingness as a shield to refuse to learn evolving culture around you, you become a boomer.

There is no hard rule. Some calculations are additive, and some are multiplicative. So everything needs to be tested in this regard.

To be fair it‚Äôs a silly solution. Just call it vc like everyone has done for the past decade - and call dm dm. Not like that‚Äôs so terrible.

Streamers need to take some slim measure of responsibility for their own well-being. Not simply leveraging their autistic fanbases to create a hugbox power fantasy.

classic servers will have rather small pop

Im fine thanks. I have a full time job, girlfriend and im happy in life. Not even gonna play thaaat much, which is just more of a reason to not regret my class choice because i won't reroll for sure and probably just drop the game if it comes to that.

September 2018 study shows 211 million American gamers:
---
https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/how-many-people-play-games-in-the-u-s-1202936332/
---
According to the study, 52% of those, or 109.7 million, play on PC.  
---
Your link to the twitch statistics claims more than 15 million daily active users.  We'll be generous and call it 16 million.
---
16 million twitch users is 14.5% of PC gamers.  
---
I'm sorry to tell you, but twitch is a small minority of gaming culture.  If you watch streams, you are statistically, the odd one out.
---
Rogue was my second lvl 60 and I also leveled subtlety. It's my favorite rogue spec.

I think there's a pair of boots that do the same thing as the belt as well.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find the name.

Thank you for the tips!

I loved the show, but I personally would have preferred Russian with subtitles.

We wouldn't be talking about it currently if they made that choice though.

This isnt an argument, it is the way it was on certain servers. I'm just brainstorming trying to maybe figure out myself why it was called VC. Know what I mean jellybean ;)
---
I have noooooooooooooooo ideaaaa hahaha. I definitely wanna be something interesting for a change too, like a druid or a dwarf or gnome. 
---
If you're worried about finding spots but don't like playing a healer, try looking into classes that may be in demand. Tons of resources, can even just search this subreddit with the search bar above. I think a decent mage or warlock is usually in demand. 
---
Don't worry about whether your good at the game or not, just try to understand tactics and make sure your playing with people that speak the same language :P.
---
Also, is going pure holy a bad idea while leveling? They've got that aoe tanking ability and that really appeals to me for when I will have to tank.
---
If I don't grab that, how do I keep thread on multiple targets?
---
I knew this line would be meme'd. But little did I know, that it'd be sexy.
---
A +hit chance filter (for melee) and a +weapon skill filter would be an amazing addition for melee sorting through end game gear options! Love the site been using since nost launch and its the fastest site for classic database too, thanks for upgrading the hardware im sure it will be hammered even more so when classic launches haha
---
This. But of course I got downvoted for elaborating.
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you I think you‚Äôre right. Someone downvoted me though.
---
DAE hate twitch?
---
Everyone?  Less that a % of the playerbase is playing and I cant imagine the majority are living vicariously through streamers.  Also, most players realize the beta experience =/= the official experience in August.  I'm not worried about exposure of content, I'd rather Blizz keeps working bugs throughout the content. They have quite the challenge stitching old content to a new engine.
---
So a new cartel.

True... as much as I've embraced Twitch and its emotes, I do wish people wouldn't use them off Twitch.
---
Th old AV was more about your overall faction than it was about any one player. If it takes you 11 games of rallying your fellow faction to overcome the other side, it makes the rep/quest rewards that much more satisfying when you get them. Sadly, the only was we will see the Shredders, strong NPCs and mines again is when/if some pserver implements them.
---
Even with the obvious humor this made my eye twitch.
---
Which is fascinating, but rather anti-helpful given that the term has a specific meaning that has nothing whatsoever to do with that.
---
Not at all, this is top priority,  what do you think all the strife in Mideast is about?
---
Who are you asking?
---
I remember a squad of gnome mages too! But this one was all controlled by one guy, and ran av all day. It was horrifying. I still have nightmares about those fireballs!!
---
Those specs wouldn't stop adding replay value to the game if they became decent all of a sudden. My two personal favorite classes have always been paladin and druid, but I generally prefer tanking. I see it as unfortunate that 2/3 trees are meme/bad spec for classes like paladin and druid because they are "hybrids", yet a class like warrior has 3 great talent trees even though they are technically hybrids as well.

You must have not played classic if you don't remember hearing the r word, old f word, gay, pussy, etc 24/7. That's not even including 1337 and that bullshit. Most people that played in 2004 were huge incels and nerds, just like today :)
---
Double druid runs into all the problems I listed above. A tank and a healer can't really kill anything. They'll just survive until the healer's out of mana and then die.
---
I would say just don't play vanilla at all at that point. It seems like you're in a phase of your life where you can't relax and look at the positive sides. Sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help that mental state.
---
Fuck you and your VC.
---
You think it does, but it really don't.
---
The term has evolved to encapsulate willingly ignorant, overly nostalgic people that identify as older on average than the norm.
---
Ah, I see. While leveling, your talents really won't matter too much. It's far more important to just have some int gear and keep up with spell ranks. If you want to be really efficient, you can melee with seal of wisdom to do a bit of dps and cut down on drinking. Usually you'll have more than enough time to just top people off with a holy light or flash spam, depending on how quickly they're taking damage and which spell is more up to date. You'll probably get bored just waiting to heal unless doing big pulls, so get in there and throw some autos.

Warlocks are EZ mode, try a warrior.
---
The end was great
---
Thank you for the guide! :D
---
did that once, diverted my attention from audiobook.  
---
would not repeat
---
There we have it. Don‚Äôt like something, ignore it. That‚Äôs not who I am. If I don‚Äôt like something I‚Äôm gonna let my voice be heard. 
---
Maybe you should use your own advice and ignore my posts, eh?
---
Constantly worrying about how others will play the game will only make it a shitty experience for yourself
---
He kited the rogue without taking damage for example, the rogue can neither run away or get to him, eventually would die even without the warrior killing him.
---
I started playing in June 2008 (I know, BC not vanilla) and I didn‚Äôt reach level 70 until November. I feel you.
---
From what I've seen on streams it's the modern tab targeting that is in the game right now.
---
I don‚Äôt even see the code anymore...
---
There is literally a ‚Äú30 year old boomer‚Äù meme that a large portion of this sub seems to fall under hence the constant references
---
Same for me, i'll be rolling up a dwarf or night elf hunter, probably, and reading their zone too. Too long since I actually played alliance with friends so we agreed to go allies for classic!
---
Except everyone in the premades wants Rank 14, so they won't help one player who plans on essentially ninja-ing it.
---
The best ones are mostly fished out of pools. I always made the most money from Oily Blackmouth and Stonescale Eel, plus floating wreckage is a nice bonus.
---
The way I see it, the players generally drive the changes in a MMO (at least to an extent). The players wanted LFG/LFR in retail, they wanted flying mounts, etc.
---
If class balance ends up getting fixed in vanilla it will be because of the playerbase. That's why I wanted to talk about it.
---
Warriors have some wiggle room.  Their PvP trinket removes stun and they hold up fair against rogues.  You might use a few extra LaP per week, but its not like you'll be using them every cooldown, and you'll still require them on orc.
---
If I went double gathering (mining/herbalism, skinning), then I sold on AH. People will be buying mats to powerlevel to prepare for raiding, either blacksmithing (for resists) or alchemy (for pots).
---
Otherwise, I paired it with a consuming profession (mining/engineering/blacksmithing, herbalism/alchemy, skinning/leatherworker, tailoring/enchanting are the best pairs) and sold the results, either vendor or AH. 
---
Fun fact: Disenchanting mats have a 1 copper deposit on the AH, it's literally pure profit, and with the constant gear turnover, people will be enchanting regularly.
---
Wand can be easily acquired by level 5 with enchanting and tailoring. Totally worth it for the levelling speed increase.
---
Botting was easier back then because the API made it way easier and because botting detection was worse. 
---
I'd expect less bots now.
---
No you can't. A standard AV game without premades is about 40 minutes long. They frequently go over an hour and occasionally several hours.
---
The variant vanilla versions make little difference. I'd still prefer a 1.5 version but I'm under no illusion about how long it'd last.
---
Also honor in 1.12 decays at 25% per kill instead of 10% per kill so there's really little incentive to continue a slugest because though your KB is padded the actual honor gain is minimal.
---
Mind soothe
---
The only people who enjoyed the old AV were either there to catch fish (the fuck was that all about anyway?) or low geared shamans and mages who could just spam aoe all the time.
---
Everybody else just quit it after seeing it's nothing but a bottleneck zergfest.
---
It took me 30 seconds to understand the joke

If you're from EU and you're playing Horde, join the community! https://discord.gg/AK74Etw

These are pretty minor things compared to what OP is suggesting and obviously not that easy to ban.
---
Getting in on a good MMO from the start
---
You can in bfa. The price on my server is ~180k gold. If you buy one it is valid for classic, too. However, you cant buy a token with the gold from classic. You have to do it via a gold farming site like back in the day.
---
Lmao
---
I think it would still be important to have beta testers run through BRD at lvl 50 at least once before release
---
No /s
---
Well it‚Äòs as simple as that, you put no effort in an own playstyle route, so you probably won‚Äòt be deep enough into the game to play efficiently
---
Sure, but first, druid tanks aren't that bad, and second, I'm merely pointing out that bad specs don't break the game.
---
Yes they nerfed it around 1.12 to be a 25% honor decay per kill (previously was 10%)
---
You‚Äôve opened my eyes sir üò±
---
I thought they just got like regular job pay, nothing special. Now that I think about it, I‚Äôm not sure why I believed that
---
Pretty sure you just discovered time travel. 
---
If watching 1 or 2 streamers and browsing this sporadically through the day can bring time to a halt, watching streamers 24/7 while simultaneously F5ing /new will surely bring you back in time... Which makes me wonder how many of you are from the future coming back to reroll on fresh servers...
---
Anyways if you chose to go back in time I'd recommend jotting down plenty of winning lottery ticket numbers. It would of course be suspicious if you won them all, so I urge you to create a network where you name is never associated with winning. Contact individuals anonymously and offer them a small slice of winning the lottery if they chose the winning numbers. You could do this endlessly whilst never arousing any unnecessary attention.

This is a company that ignored Diablo franchise for years, delivered a lackluster product and forgot about the series. Then decided to end their opening conference, where hardcore fans spent hundreds of dollars to attend, and graced them with a *mobile* version of Diablo. I know this whole thing is old news now, but it demonstrates the sheer amount of incompetence at Blizzard today.
---
This is a company that has developers who have driven Retail WoW to such an awful state, that fans are begging to play a much older and buggier version of the game. If changes to WoW were good, then BFA would be an amazing game. It is not. Its a bad game *because of changes*.
---
This is a group of developers who have made WoW have less RPG elements than a generic baseball and basketball game in 2019. I am not even memeing, go play MLB The Show or NBA 2k, you might become physically ill when you see how expansive the RPG elements are in those games compared to Retail WoW.
---
Separate what you think could happen in theory and what likely will happen in practice. You may think a do-over sounds promising, but these people do not even like Classic, as they have accidentally made it known. They see its existence as lack of faith in them as developers and a middle finger to their work, which lets be frank, it is.
---
It makes it much more rewarding when it drops :)
---
Anytime a baby boomer makes fun of millennials just show them twitch chat full of generation Z
---
If it was a purely botting account (which is actually less common) he probably did a lot of the leveling via the bot, too.
---
Much blurry, no read &gt;&lt;
---
No. The rogue could have easily made it Grom'gol or even Booty Bay. Except it was a bot.

Just picked up lace nail shoulders üòé
---
I botted 8 accounts on 1 computer. There‚Äôs a area in shadowmoon valley that‚Äôs pretty secluded that had mana rays. Sold bulk primal mana and any jc recipes that dropped. 
---
It was on 8 different servers and the price was always the same. The only thing I spent my gold on was I bought arena points each week till my characters had pretty decent gear and could farm efficiently.
---
It's funny how bold claims about a majority suddenly start to get qualified once actual numbers come into the scene.

Don't like that study?  How about an April 2019 report that Steam has 90 million monthly users: 
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-now-has-90-million-monthly-users/
---
Twitch users don't even make up 18% of Steam gamers.  
---
But please keep trying to narrow the deifinition of "modern gamer" to only people who care about Twitch.
---
Not that I give a single fuck about the culture and wish all these idiots weren't so awkward, but I do know that exactly such a thing exists for the modern wow client as an addon.
---
On the opposite end, dailies can be looked at as incentive to keep playing after the content is completed and you're getting ready for the next expansion or content addition.

However, it does feel like a chore. That I will not deny.

Tyvm. Hunter isn't my 1st choice, but I'm not a fan of casters and warrior/rogue seems a very populated class already.
---
pog = :O
---
I'm stuck. I want to play a warlock or a hunter, but I pretty much exclusively play Tauren. I hear people saying all the time that hunters are bad and unenjoyable in classic, especially Tauren hunters. Am I going to regret playing a hunter? Should I just suck it up and play another race as warlock? It just feels wrong not having my main be Tauren.
---
Zug fucking zug
---
Unfortunately Classic doesn't have to murlocs rightly tuned.
---
Good thing they look the best as well, so it's a win/win!  
---
Nothing beats their special 1h and 2h attack animations.
---
Be sure to catch the next video where I decimate redridge, rendering it unplayable for lowbies across the world.

Seems irl buddies going horde, guess I will roll undead, which in turn narrows my class choices at least
---
Yes. Blizzard ticks every second. Rain of Fire ticks every 2 seconds.
---
Casting all the portals in one spot and then playing portal roulette was always fun
---
I wasn't sure either, I had to look it up when I first saw it.  It's weird they both got that giant fur collar thing going on.  I thought it was captain cold or captain boomerang.
---
Also those white cloth hoods from Hillsbrad Foothills quests. Yeeah!
---
PvP I believe you'll only need 5% hit, PVE is 8% I think; plus more for white hits.  I don't recall 100%.  You can safely drop some of that hit rating for stamina and it might be worth it to drop some offensive stats to get more stamina.  Stamina in PvP goes a long way.  If you can blast fools but can't stay alive through a kidney shot, you need to focus on staying alive more than damage.
---
I only need ONE subscription right? 
---
Right now I am subscribed monthly, but I didn‚Äôt buy BfA. When classic comes out I can download it, play, and also continue to play the heroes i have right now? They will just be two separate games that are covered by one monthly fee?
---
I see this shit on Reddit and YouTube all the time and wonder if there's some browser add-on I'm supposed to be using to understand what they mean. So the kids are just retarded then? I thought I was the only one out of the loop.

hello i have a grp of 20 spanish speakers ready to roll horde side, hit me up
---
The is probably the best place, as there are playerless caves full of harpies and they also have a good loot table so if you're not getting a lot of feathers, at least you're getting something of value.
---
No one forced you to do the daily quests...
---
And they were MUCH more tedious in TBC.
---
I‚Äôm sure not having a beta key must be a bug!
---
Eh? Login to &lt;name redacted&gt; (biggest pserver now) and see if you can finish a cigarette by the time you've gotten your first gold seller spam whisper.
---
And anyway, the main reason there used to be less gold selling on pservers was that a lot of people played them with the idea that they are free. The demographic is already selected for those who are less likely to pay for stuff.
---
It's pfUI. An interface replacement similar to ElvUI and the likes on retail. Only other addons I have are Questie and Cartographer.

Love your site ive been using it all the time since the nost days its easily the fastest database out there with all the great functions. Thanks for adding the supersearch function it helps out a lot trying to track down gear. And the upgraded hardware will be super helpful come launch when everyones using it haha
---
I love you both
---
Agree. Getting ‚Äûspoiled‚Äú on a 15 year old game. We know how everything looks and how it is played. Some people really need to take a step backwards and let their emotions go away
---
Or accept that while he streams he might get ganked and not have fun, he's at work and its part of the job. If he hates it so much he can play the game offstream when not at work like the rest of us
---
I never understood blizzards logic with UBRS and it's connection to BWL even tho at the time during the phase 1 days I was like sweet let's go get nefarian of wait it's not open yet.... Well at least we have MC.
---
Well, I just botted the leveling process too. Got banned in wotlk and never botted again
---
I think there will be eventually, its too good of an income for blizz to pass.
---
i know that one
---
Aside from Asmongold and Sodapoppin there is almost no reason to avoid streamers. 
---
It's also not a coincidence that these two are the ones that are most annoyed by stream snipers, because their personality makes them stream sniped. For example soda acting like an entitled little bitch only attracts more people that will want to annoy him, peopel that stream snipe do it for their reaction.
---
Staysafe and Esfand, both have a smaller viewer base but ~10k viewers is still a considerable amount and I never saw anyone harass them like they do Asmon and Soda and if either of them played on my server I wouldn't mind the slightest.
---

---
My dude the AH moguls, the nolifers and streamers will have the server economy dominated inside a week.
---
Kappa is a letter?
---
There are guides for this. Somebody even made a mod that gave you an extra sort option when you learn spells.
---
In vanilla, tank threat generation is a major limiting factor. Most dps classes will need to hold back so they don't pull aggro.
---
So if there is extra healing, the MT can change a few pieces of gear for less mitigation and more threat generation, which means the dps classes don't have to hold back as much. Or you switch to a bear tank with better threat gen.
---
Usually that's how guilds do things if they have an extra healer, rather than having healers switch to dps. Keep in mind that healing gear in vanilla has +heal and doesn't have +dmg, so a healer would need a second set of gear for dps.
---
That said, it's pretty common for priests to wand for some added dps on trash and certain fights, especially if you overgear the instance. Some raid leaders will start chain-pulling trash in that case, though, so it can keep the healers pretty busy.
---
The term comes up quite a lot when discussing the sociological, economic, and political aftereffects of that one unusually outsized generation. It gets a lot of use because it is a particularly effective referent for such topics.
---
Conversely, you are literally the first and only person I have ever seen propose that it should mean some quite unrelated, less specific, and less useful thing. We have a whole delightfully rich vocabulary for talking about people whose views are shaped by age, covering the full spectrum from complimentary to pejorative.
---
This may be true but the pserver I played on had an influx of thousands of new players when people didnt get beta so theres still plenty of low level people doin shit
---
Oh noes, internet people feeling triggered. Boohoo, cmar
---
All the people complaining about twitch chat emotes and emote culture as if you didn‚Äôt use ROFL LMAO ROFLCOPTER WOOT. What the fuck is a woot? Twitch emotes are pretty fucking easy to understand lol, a quick google search clues you right into what Pog is and what it looks like, and why it‚Äôs used. I can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs elitism over what dumb ass version of text emotes people use of woot/rofl vs pog/LUL
---
Arms takes up 2 debuff slots though, be wary of that
---
Until you have to kill some water elementals. It's worth taking at least one other spell from fire.
---
Those got old as fuck really fast too.
---
Holy shit you ARE a prime boomer.
---
Okay, there are two kinds of boomer, the term used in socioeconomics, and boomer, the meme kind.
---
We are talking about the meme, boomers/zoomers.
---
Ubrs was supposed to be a 10 man raid. Lbrs was the 5man.
---
You‚Äôre either a great hunter or a shitty hunter. There is no in between lol
---
Hate is a strong word. I don't like it, certainly. I find my entertainment ruined by the streamer having to pause every other minute to address XXXmokaS and read aloud whatever nonsense he paied a buck for
---
Same with Staghelm.
---
The boomers are out in force Pepelaugh
---
How about wands? And how often do healers go oom?
---
that wont happend because you announce dire maul with the wing DM:W
---
This argument is really flawed. You cannot treat an AV team as a singular entity unless it truly is a full-blown premade, in which case it is pretty much pointless to reason about how the battle will go anyway.
---
In your average AV match, it is not as if "the entire team" decides to rush. No matter what, there will be people defending, as some people plainly have more fun doing so. The problem is that in later versions those handful of people can generally not put up an effective defense, and can certainly not cause hour long stalemates.
---
In 1.5, I wouldn't be so certain. By improving the ability to defend with a fairly small number of players, you'd make longer games, consequently making it more important to utilise things such as the cavalry and the bosses to break defenses.
---
The way in which the majority plays AV does not need to dictate the length of your average AV game.
---
If I‚Äôm tanking as a warrior, personally I‚Äôd rather be troll. The beserking skill that gives like 25% faster hits but 50% less able to be healed isn‚Äôt good for PvE
---
Vanilla was just as if not more buggy and retail....
---
Haha was fun.
---
Lots of love.
---
"Aunt Karen died, lol."
---
As long as the gear is appropriate, I doubt anyone will care. I believe a cloth chest is BiS for a while, but it's not like it's going to be required unless you're trying to get into a hardcore guild.

---
[There are plenty of streamers your server should want to avoid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM)
---
You're assuming all the pre-mades will cooperate. If there's like 3-4 different pre-made groups that all are trying to get rank 14 for their members, if one of those groups realizes that they can play more than the others they will just do that to out-compete them.
---
&gt;You come off a bit condescending
---
I no longer care.
---
Honestly, this r/ has become so toxic, and full of "what about this tiny change", "look at that streamervid" and similar shitposts, that I don't even feel much like logging on any more.
---
Similarly, people here are among the thinnest skinned internet CBs I have ever seen. Dare to write anything that is not 100% supportive and positive, or disagree with what people believe is right, even if it's bullshit, and you can earn yourself a torrent of downvotes.
---
I pity all these people once classic hits.   
---
And I am glad the german WoW community is different.
---
Peace.
---
I think it's fair to be cynical. I grew up with old Blizz, that had a real standard of quality. The old blizz that would shitcan entire games that were basically completed instead of pushing them out the door for money. That company is gone.
---
However, even from a cynical standpoint, they'll support what makes them money. If classic is successful, it's going to get attention. A vocal OSRS style playerbase can hopefully be the guiding hand that lets us build on what makes wow good instead of it becoming retail.
---
Like. Excitement. Woo did ya see that? I think.
---
I fucking hated daily quests in TBC.
---
One of many reasons I hoping for the outside chance of expanding vanilla instead.
---
They are idiots
---
Running alone would take shitload of time though.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again
---
&gt; Im the only one here who will focus on professions insted of level? 
---
Nope. A lot of people will do that. I bought my first mount in Vanilla solely with fish. I bought recipes and was fishing and then selling "level cooking" packages to players who didn't want to go through the process of finding the recipes and getting the fish themselves.
---
Some game out their do daily challenges and do them well, games for instance like "Slay the Spire", and "Binding of Issac." If the devs put as much heart into the dailies as these are given, ie unique challenges based on changes to basic to esoteric mechanics, then they would have been engaging, fun, and likely something to look forward to. Instead they went down the route of the same thing day in day out, until the next patch where you may get to move on to another batch.
---
Just retarded. And wrong. Europoors call it DM.
---
It was VC in retail vanilla on Staghelm and Kargath.
---
hate to burst your bubble, but I highly doubt this is possible.  I've leveled in NE zone strictly as human way back on vanilla and best I ever got was a decent chunk into reveered by the low 40s.  Thinking you might be basing this off either current retail rep or some inaccurate p server / website
---
Are we not doing phrasing anymore?!
---
We're talking old school vanilla here, even if it seemed like a bot (could be sure), there were people who did play this bad. Not everyone but there were truely awful players keyboard turning and all that noob stuff.
---
Obviously a competent player could escape or kill the hunter.
---
I'm not scolding anyone.
---
And people being self-obsessed tiny little internet Dramaqueens, constantly on the lookput for something they can throw a hissy fit over, whether or not it's directed at them, or in fact anyone, is not my problem.
---
That Sunwell Island was the worst.
---
And you hade a damn hard time to get non rogues for UBRS some times.
---
I understood this reference!
---
Thanks! 
---
Improved charge seems a decent talent for initial threat.
---
Regardless, it's a bad system.
---
You'll be doing lots of autoattacking as you start leveling up more so you don't go oom instantly, so spirit is actually decent as well. All stats are good, so whatever items are best often are the best for shamans.
---
Decurse/Buff here and there but mostly just to see what was happenin
---
I don‚Äôt even have a lawn and I want them off my lawn.
---
Yep, I‚Äôm old.
---
Yeah because abbreviating a dungeon using two letters that aren't in the dungeon name is definitely like, unretarded.
---
I mean the constant bashing of streamers and Twitch seems kinda toxic and childish. I'll be avoiding streamer servers at launch but Jesus the people here are taking it to the next level
---
This is just another reason they should ban multiboxing.
---
He wasn‚Äôt even in the flag room when the rogue walked out with it, he was in the graveyard rezzing.
---
Someone told me to use this when I had to shit really bad during a raid. I lold.
---
But you shouldn't make it require additional effort to know what they're talking about! It should be clear at a glance
---
Pally tanking is extremely tough in vanilla, they have no real taunt and no way to get defense cap.

At 167 +heal, sure R5 has 1.5% better HPM, but R6 has 20% more HPS... So I have no idea how you say R5&gt;R6 at this gear level, it is just madness.
---
Invading a city to take down its King is epic AF!
---
Friendly reminder that BfA is probably the most balanced version of WoW we ever had, in terms of Class performance.
---
And now ask yourself, if it's a better game because of it.
---
hahah even the vanilla punishments were better than the modern day punishments, thats brilliant :D
---
Haha yeah i forgot about that thing. With the eyeball lol
---
Yeah, I think you can level tailoring and enchanting enough to make the lesser wand with about 50 linen. Or you can buy one from somebody else who leveled enchanting. They'll probably be on the AH within hours of launch.
---
Nobody on horde calls it VC, and neither does at least half of the alliance. Anyone who calls it VC definitely did not play vanilla. My guess is they started post wrath.
---
So true, i remeber it was like, oh i must do daily, just when i open eyes in morning, first thing to do lol
---
No wonder why everyone sucked in Vanilla.  Why does a mage need 40 raid frames up

Not really. Enhance is not a raid spec and there is very little gear in there to do so. If you want to dps in raids you need to roll a dps class.
---
If you really cared about this you could compile a list of known bugs (that bothered you) in vanilla and reach out to a streamer (i.e. Joanna) or another beta player to test them.

Oh you‚Äôre one of those guys

If you use the stuck feature while your hearthstone is *off* of cooldown, it just hearths you. If it is *off* cooldown, it kills you and allows you to release to a GY.

I might suggest that someone who can't tell the difference between people in their 40s and people in their 70s might be the one out of touch.
---
Choosing to willfully embrace such a narrow worldview as to refuse to differentiate between the vast majority of people who are more than a few years away from you is not something of which one should be proud.
---
Tokens will be in Classic at least indirectly. Since Classic and Retail share a subscription Tokens will have value in Classic.  Its very likely Tokens in Retail will be traded for gold in Classic.
---
He also mentioned charging for said addon which Blizzard does not allow (cannot explicitly charge for an addon, charge for access to an addon, or request donations through an addon).
---
That said, not sure if he was joking but if the development of the addon hinges on being able to sell it, it will not work out.
---
You should put non intrusive ads on your site. Get paid for your hard work. Those who don‚Äôt want ads will enable their ad blocker anyway. Seriously. You‚Äôre basically pissing money down the drain at this point
---
Lol actual warfronts

Pretty easy to protect against. Just limit regex computation time.

New is crap, short answer üòÇ

---
Not to burst your bubble, but Thunderfury takes a whole tryhard guild to get for the main tank. Main tank tryhard guilds will generally be Humans and Orcs.
---
How does this search work? What do the numbers mean?
---
I always thought it was private send tell.
---
This is how it worked in Vanilla. Once the Honor system was understood, R14 was never a surprise. It was always negotiated and controlled.
---
Even if you ninja R14 once, after the standings come out, everyone else that agreed to the most efficient way to make sure everyone gets it will make sure the other 14 members of your premade never get it.
---
R14 already requires 12+ hours a day. No one wants to have to play 20+ hours a day to steal it. So you fall in line.
---
It makes me wonder why rank 4 HT is so widely recommended for a raiding druid. Is it because the max rank makes it hard to heal without overhealing, making the lower ranks more efficient, or have people been recommending rank 4 based on people being in full Naxx gear?
---
Hahahahaha
---
Very little.   
---
Priests are building both a DPS and healing spell set, so in classic most of your spells are inherently useful. The only ones which are **situational** are:    
---
 - Cure Disease (I'd still learn it, but you technically could skip for a while).     
---
 - Mind Soothe (doesn't work as well as you'd think from the tooltip)   
---
 - Mana Burn (mostly a PvP exclusive spell)   
---
 - Mind Control (mostly PvP, you don't get XP if mobs kill one another)    
---
 - Levitate (situational but useful for water walking/not dying, even in STV)    
---
 - Shackle Undead (kinda useful but against one specific type of mob that only exist in a handful of zones (very useful at 50s though due to WPL/EPL))
---
God I hate the nose ones.
---
The first leather pads were always nice, but Hillman's Shoulders usually turns out to be my first green shoulder piece.  It's always great to snag that first pair.
---
First piece of headgear seems to feel better to me than shoulders for some reason...probably because it takes longer to get.
---
Level as frost. Upgrade frostbolt, conjure water/food, arcane int, frost armor. Get frost nova 1, blink. Evocation. Low level fire ball. Polymorph. Blizzard if you are AoE-ing. Cone of cold. 
---
Skip rest.
---
I will comment this again as I do on every post asking this question. In order to make lets say Prot Pally viable its not as simple as Blizzard tuning some numbers. Thats not the only reason these specs under perform, its their accessibility to loot that caters to them. Prot pallys specifically cant not acquire the same level of itemized gear that a prot warrior can so even if they tuned them they would still be worse. And adding additional items to cater to these classes is just out of the question honestly.
---
spahget
---
Anything around reputation becomes a chore. Dailies, rep turn ins, etc.
---
1. Get 2 gathering professions 
---
2. Farm gold 
---
3. Buy all spells and have money for mount at 40
---
4. Profit
---
Lmao the fucking accuracy
---
Yea I mean, it worked I 100% got the message to stop fucking around. 
---
I still regret losing my plagued protodrake.
---
Ah, so only True Scotsman gamers.
---
I hadn't originally noticed that you were the same person to whom I was replying in another thread, but you seem _awfully_ attached to trying to make up your own meaningless definitions of words in order to support your preconceptions and make your tiny niche of life feel more universal than it is.
---
&gt; If classic is successful, it's going to get attention.
---
Food for thought:
---
If classic is successful, it will be successful because of how it IS, not because of how a vocal minority of people who confuse "Balance" with "Good" think it should've been.
---
&gt; A vocal OSRS style playerbase can hopefully be the guiding hand
---
Or, and here is a crazy thought:  
---
A non-vocal total majority of sane people, who realize that a game that's absolutely balanced is more boring and less immersive than a game that shouldn't be balanced (RPG) but is anyway, could be guiding Blizzard towards something on the same principles, but even better than WoW.
---
Looking for total Balance? BfA is the, hands down, most balanced version of WoW ever created in terms of class performance. At the same time, it is also by far the most hated version, and about to be replaced by a helluva lot of people, with a 14 year old version of the same game.
---
Stop for a moment and ask yourself why that is.
---
Holy shit, what up North. You planning on trying out classic?
---
That would be super useful!
---
You can‚Äôt actually trade the tokens... The only way to make any of that work would be to trade someone gold on retail for gold on classic or vice versa. Which means you would have to trust the person your trading with a lot or run the high risk of getting scammed.
---
"Husky", "Burly" dudes.
---
If i understand it correctly, the old tab targeting selects the nearest target and the new one selects the nearest in a cone infront of your character. But i read in a forum post that there's a options in the settings where you can choose if you want the old system. Didn't checked it but maybe someone can confirm?
---
If you are afraid nostalgia doesn‚Äòt kick in on horde side. Start alliance and get a hordy twink afterwards
---
&gt;I might suggest that someone who can't tell the difference between people in their 40s and people in their 70s might be the one out of touch.
---
you're reading too much into a meme, they overgeneralize as part of the joke.
---
It's just like calling someone a manlet, it used to be 5'9, now it's part of the joke to call anyone under 6'2 a manlet.
---
Stop being such a blowhard and go with the flow and have some fun, people will like you more.
---
They said it might be removed before phase 2 but that will be the latest.
---
Other side of the aisle here! But nice to see other Kargath folks! Gnomermage was the name, annoying gnome mage was the game.
---
I rarely see the faction leaders in av die on retail until all towers are down, occasionally with one tower up it happens, and a real organized group with good tank/heals can do 2 towers up but I feel it's pretty rare.
---
I haven't been bging much in bfa tho, just occasional forays out of boredom. There's just no reward at all for queuing
---
Ah makes sense. Thank you
---
Undead female 1h special attack.  It does a front flip thing.
---
Well of course not. It‚Äôs no coincidence that Rag is the longest standing raid boss in WoW to this day. Time changes things. Can‚Äôt erase the skill and knowledge of 15 years.
---
Your ui is classic*
---
After actually looking at that spec, get rid of improved sunder and imp shield block.
---
Improved sunder will increase TPS a tiny bit but deep wounds / impale are much better options for that. I stand by my arms/ fury tree 100%. The only reason for imp sunder is for TPS and making it cost a couple less rage is not a good use of points.
---
The 3/5 cruetly I can see where people are concerned because 2% crit is a lot, but imo impale is still better
---
I think you're confusing boomers with baby boomers.
---
It's equally bad as "grind these mobs for weeks for repeatable rep turn-ins".
---
You're absolutely right; baby boomers and "boomers" are different groups that can clearly be distinguished with context clues. People can complain about the evolution of language all they want, but it's inevitable and almost never happens without a purpose. 
---
While I'm not exactly keen on the idea of exclusively using Twitch emotes to communicate in situations outside of Twitch, I think that they certainly have their niche. And frankly, it's not difficult for someone to blindly hate on these emotes and feel superior to the "kiddos" that use them. People want to feel superior to others. Calling Twitch emotes "cancer" or the people who use them "adorable" in a condescending manner isn't a sign of maturity--it's just another way to get that feeling that you're better than a mass of people. So when these people get called "boomers," it's not their age that makes that title accurate, it's their attitude.
---
Here are all the currently available payment methods on twitch:  https://imgur.com/eoDhi0x  (screenshot of the payment method page I just took). Someone makes illegal money, pays anonymously through any of the various methods (gift cards, etc), and donates it to a streamer, then it becomes 'real' money. The streamer can then distribute it back out and say it was a legal donation with no worry of where it came from. Sure, this isn't every major donation, probably not most, but it is still entirely possible. It would still be pretty hard to donate 50k through this method anonymously, those are probably just rich people. But many small donations can add up, it can be very worth the time taken.
---
Yeah but it was optimal to do the dailies.
---
Just like the LFG system - you weren't forced to use it but it was the fastest way to find a group.
---
Wtf does any of that mean? Millennial Dad checking in
---
Don't worry. With PvP being implemented in phase 2 with no BGs. Multiboxing with be one of the cleanest, easiest and fastest way to rank characters. 
---
So you're going to get absolutely smashed by lots of mtiboxers just likes original vanilla. Probably ever more so.
---
https://i.imgur.com/06kVHq9.jpg
---
Why did you put your name on it like you have to prove to everyone that you're not reposting, when it's something nobody would ever give a shit about.
---
It's hard to describe, but the system just has a few differences in priority.
---
Great way to devalue individual wealth and promote gold selling at the same time.  Dailies were unbelievably destructive to the economy.
---
&gt; Even if you ninja R14 once, after the standings come out, everyone else that agreed to the most efficient way to make sure everyone gets it will make sure the other 14 members of your premade never get it.
---
How ? If it's clear that your group can play more/better than the other groups, how do they stop you from not taking it week after week ?
---
I get that it has become more popular to fall in line because, as you say, no one wants to do the hard grind. But if the choice is wait 9 months until it's your turn or go hard at it and take it right away most of the hardcore people will choose the latter.
---
Same with US Laughing Skull and US Medivh
---
All the calculations are described in the GitHub readme linked on the site (Its in the tip when you first load). And as stated there I only look at the HPM, I am working on extending to smarter picks based on other limits, and to introduce spell affecting talents. If you have any specific sources you thing I should consider please comment them here.

Someone doesn't play shaman
---
Oof didn‚Äôt realize how upset it was going to make you lol
---
Sure he could have worded it in a less elitist way, but he's somewhat right.  One of the best parts of classic is the amount of content while leveling and this will be missed if speed leveling and following an autopilot-like addon.    
---
It's a very BFA-like experience to follow an arrow telling you what to do, skipping hard group quests, skipping dungeons, likely skipping professions, etc.  Don't see how anyone can deny that.
---
Im actually so fucking jealous. Stay off the subreddit and keep yourself pure. Stick with it, because sometimes the leveling seems tough, and very slow, but every level you will realize how badly you want to hit 60.
---
Because addons
---
They claimed they would, I have no idea how it will impact realms during the transition, I hope realms don't end up with a massive faction imbalance cause that wouldn't be much fun tbh.
---
So your complaint is that Blizzard implemented something you didn't have to do, but you wanted the rewards anyway, you just didn't like what you had to do to get them.
---
Welcome to an MMORPG...
---
That's not how it works.
---
It‚Äôs not about being spoiled you idiot it‚Äôs about maintaining the hype for the game. If stuff like the raids is revealed before release it will undoubtedly kill some of the hype
---
BE INTIMIDATED
---
BE AFRAID. 
---
FOR IF YOU DO NOT FEAR IT. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.
---
Do you like half rotted corpses and terrible posture?
---
Friends are going Horde so I'll probably follow. But I dislike literally all the character models. The orc female model isn't too bad, but their running animation is awful. 
---
Ironforge is also my favorite city, Orgrimmar isn't terrible, but still a bit sad about that. 
---
Also with WoW being a very typical fantasy setting, it makes more sense to play as the typical medieval-ish knights/wizards/whatever going out to kill the bad guys. Horde lore or whatever is ok, but as far as immersion of your characters story progression goes I think alliance is much better.
---
Can someone tell me which emote he types?
---
Ahh good I thought they were tradeable since you can sell them on the AH, glad thats not the case!
---
We wish we could play wow for the first time too. 
---
Classic is a much better way to start the game. 
---
Start playing the game and people will help you out and by the time you get to 60 you will learn the basics of your class unlike in retail where you can get to max level without knowing what spells you have.
---
Is this subreddit just a bunch of boomers hating on streamers?
---
Dude, its 3 people. Druid, Warrior and Paladin. "I'm dps."
---
But it still is no changes, its just a earlier version of wow...No changes means nothing that wasn't in the original game, not "1.12 or reeeeeeeee"
---
I'm gonna be grouping up with myself on launch day; I suppose you could say I'll be playing with myself. So I'll need some privacy in Mulgore, please.
---
Lets see them grow up and try to get a job when their resume is just twitch emoticons strung together. Then when the human resource manager asks them what it means, they will just grin and say "Kappa".  
---
Then they will be homeless as they are functionally illiterate, but like... ironically functionally illiterate, kappa?
---
No they're leaving all the bugs in
---
Referring to a demographic-specific type of communication as evolving culture is blatant human tribalism, and your 'othering' that you seem so keen to do is even further proof that this is tribalism.
---
"If you don't accept that this is normal communication, then you belong in this tribe and I will ridicule you"
---
That's what you sound like right now.
---
Everyone should always level first aid while leveling.
---
If you are hardcore on launch you should not worry about proffessions on launch but rather just get ahead. It's way more effecient to grind gold at level 60, than at level 40 fx.
---
However if you are going for the full classic experience then doing proffesions while leveling is great.
---
That's a good point. Here you go with Forsaken-ish yellow eyes.
---
[https://imgur.com/oGXP5Zo](https://imgur.com/oGXP5Zo)
---
It suspect it‚Äôs because it actually is better. My calculations are at the moment not considering how much better HPM a rank has. Which means that if a rank has 1 HPM better than the rank above, but 100 HPS lower, it will still be picked, even though it might not be the better pick. I am working on getting these type of factors in to the calculations, but I am not sure how I want to balance the limits.
---
There isn't a server you can speak of that have tested this.
---
Yeah I'll kappa to that. Whatever that means.
---
Yeah, people were talking about how pserver would only burn you out. However after finally giving up on BfA last week because I just can't stand it anymore I decided to try a pserver, for the first time in years. 
---
It's pretty damn fun, I'm just playing casually, altough I plan playing pretty hardcore when Classic releases. However on pserver I'm just figuring out levelling routes, professions and most importantly getting used to vanilla gameplay after spending last few years on retail. I'm also planning on levelling more classes only to 20 or so to decide what I'll play on release.
---
I'm glad I decided to give pservers a try.
---
&gt;but you seem awfully attached to trying to make up your own meaningless definitions of words in order to support your preconceptions and make your tiny niche of life feel more universal than it is.
---
Now this is some top tier projecting. You realize you are describing yourself, right?
---
You won't die at least, but yeah... it's pretty slow. However, you will be desired for group content and you get a free level 40 mount which will save you a lot of time with farming.
---
I raided as a paladin in vanilla with a semi-hardcore guild. We had a prot paladin and ret paladin in our guild, and they did alright as raid healers/utility (AQ40 up to c'thun and the first few bosses of Naxx).
---
20/0/31 should be fine through MC/BWL, and potentially beyond that. Just find a guild that is more flexible on spec.
---
You can make a solid healing set with leather and mail. It might take a bit of extra farming, but it's doable, especially if you're okay with things like cloth bracers. The fresh-60 and MC phase is very light on healing plate, but it gets progressively better after that.
---
There's a lot of good paladin healing gear that comes out of DM, ZG, and AQ40. If you aren't at the cutting edge of raid content, you should be able to gear up there pretty easily, after those instances are released.
---
How.
---
I can see this, I think as the streamer climes in levels his in game follower numbers will decline. By 60 I'd imagine a streamer and his following will basically be kill on sight for most of the hardcore gamers and he'd only have the numbers of a normal if not small sized guild. It might actually make for some good world pvp as if he's streaming, people that want to kill him might organise and go to the location he's broadcasting from and have some large scale battles just to ruin his stream.
---
I have a lvl 28 rogue on the beta. Tab targetting feels a lot better than it does in bfa. It feels more like how I remembered it being in the past.
---
 I hope that is exactly what I sound like because that is the core foundation of what this aspect of our culture hinges on. I'm glad I communicated the meaning behind the meme effectively.
---
No, the only reason you managed to ninja it is because the other premades stopped playing at the agreed point and you secretly kept going.
---
Once the standings come out, anyone that queues with you will be shunned from every premade and they will push hard enough to make sure it doesn't happen again.
---
Getting R14 before it was your turn was a much worse offense than ninja looting anything in a raid instance. You basically had to transfer servers after.
---
I think it is actually demonslaying. The two weapons are the same model too :)
---
You can all keep dreaming. They are just go to leave classic the way it is. They won‚Äôt give any new content to classic. Anything new would go to retail.
---
Who knew it was either or? Scarlet Crusade on Alliance we said DM. Other people said VC. Anyone who says that it was definitely VC, or FM, are wrong themselves. Was both. Depends on time frame. Was DM on my server because it was out first. iirc people just said Dire or DM:E. But, other servers had the VC and DM differentiation.
---
lmao
---
They just got clobbered in Zul'Farrak yesterday so I definitely couldnt see them doing it at 50.
---
Think of the emotes as small memes and it all makes sense
---
I hope Blizz lay down the absolute law with Gold Buyers.
---
If you buy gold, your account is ban, permanently from the game. Every game you have on that account can now not be played. Your I'd is replaced with something like 'I cheat at games'. Just every single legal negative Blizz can do, they employ.
---
That's the only hope of stemming things by any margin. You'll never stop it completely but by cutting demand you can limit supply.
---
More than likely some of us will be giving it a shot.
---
That‚Äôs probably most likely, but tbh this wouldn‚Äôt change Classic, it‚Äôd be ‚Äúafter‚Äù classic.
---
I  personally want to see a Feral druid get it so the server just gets really mad at the fact that a feral druid has HOR.
---
This is accurate.
---
do you have a link to the warrior maraudon farm guide? a quick google search didn't get me anywhere.
---
I love how people are taking this as anti-this or anti-that when I'm pretty sure this is just a joke and I find it hilarious. Plus I use twitch regularly so \*shrugs\*.
---
Weird, i just assumed you had to link your credit card
---
This but i would upgrade fireball to max as you level for when you run into water elementals.
---
The class is quite strong in dungeons and other small group content. Their raid dps also starts off strong, but they don't scale as well as other dps. In addition, you're basically forced to play marksman and dismiss your pet for 40 mans.
---
If you're okay with that and think you'll enjoy hunter, then you should play hunter. Every class will have a spot/role in classic.
---
Valor shoulders and Arcanite reaper are the reason people today think how hard it used to be.
---
It's like cheering in a crowd.
---
You don't always have to play "optimal" to have fun. Play a game in a way that's fun, if it's not fun don't play it.
---
Depends on the success of Classic and if retail fails to recapture #'s in the next expac.
---
RIP. What about hellfire? It seemed to tick faster and have good damage, but does the self damage make it too risky?
---
I completely disagree. I agree with OP that they could and *should* add some new content to classic.
---
Wow, being proud of a toxic 'culture' is a pretty shitty way to approach social interaction dude. Didn't you just tell someone else to 'go with the flow and people will like you more'? Or does that only apply to people outside your 'tribe'?
---
Haha, I most probably did afterwards, i had silly announcements in guild chat at every level... people were really patient with me :)
---
Yeah screw steamers, also where is my beta key? Why did I resub thinking they would send me one?
---
Someone PLEASE take that guild name before they do
---
It created a single line for you to complete each day. Probably one of the biggest changes that lead to the game being ‚Äúsingle player.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh, gotta log on and hit my daily route!‚Äù
---
It makes me wonder if a lot of people even want to play classic.
---
i never actually found warrior all that hard.  Some caves and such were a little tricky but overall its not that bad.
---
Then it‚Äôs not classic anymore. The people who fought for this to happen wanted it just the way it was so that‚Äôs what you are getting.
---
I did the same but a human rogue. Died so many damn times between the levels of 6 to 10. But the nonbeta server I noticed had twice the number of spawns in the starting zone than the stress test did. Also they would spawn very quickly and a few of the deaths were from a respawn right on top of the group lol. Non beta servers are def not right because (double spawns and super fast spawn rate) I know for a fact it was not like that in vanilla.
---
&gt; Stop being such a blowhard and go with the flow and have some fun, people will like you more.
---
I actually remember what you're experiencing. Adolescents tend to be absolutely terrified of expressing opinions about things, or being seen to care about things, or to actually like anything, for fear of judgment and exclusion. Opinions or excitement are carefully reserved for safe topics where one can be sure of group approval.
---
Fortunately, I can assure you that it does get better, and you will reach a point at which you are comfortable actually expressing opinions without needing to reassure yourself first that they are popular.
---
The hardest boss in classic wow is guild drama. For example, one big reason decent guilds do not let shamans dps in raids is not that they do trash dps, which is true, but if a guild lets one shaman dps then all the shamans want that spot. Its much better to say shamans heal only.
---
I really hope its the new system, the old one is shit and is extra shit when youre in a dungeon that has mobs above/ below you. That was one of the first things i noticed while tanking on pvt servers. Modern tab targetting just seems to always latch onto what you want to , if not will guess correctly the second press
---
There are browser addons that convert these to emotes, just like how the regular emojis work on Facebook, so you were right. But yeah, twitch chat is mostly retarded kids spamming meaningless twitch emotes, you can't write a normal sentence with actual meaning and thinking behind. This doesn't apply to less popular streamers though, chat is better there.
---
&gt; No, the only reason you managed to ninja it is because the other premades stopped playing at the agreed point and you secretly kept going.
---
Another assumption. But what you're basically saying here is that your group isn't the group that can play the most, and there's some other group that can. Which means they are the ones in control, exactly like I'm saying. No matter how you spin it it's always gonna be the people who are able to dedicated themselves the most to it that gets to decide who gets rank 14.
---
Just watched that episode last night. The miners are great. Direct and straight to the point, very effective group.
---
*its
---
*their
---
The ONLY thing Blizz needs to be careful is about listening to the people too much and to be careful about power creeping between releases.
---
Does it have the option for tab to target the nearest player instead of target? This is huge in retail for arenas
---
Why?
---
Yeah, but that‚Äôs not to say 2 years down the road they cannot release new content.
---
So....not hundreds of servers, got it.
---
The ideal solution would be to leave a few classic servers as is. Then have different servers you add on with be it expansions or new content.
---
People are worried about a forced TBC. A forced change to classic would piss off people just as much.
---
Whole reason we are here is cause you couldn‚Äôt get the experience elsewhere and blizzard finally caved. Would be dumb to just make it so you can‚Äôt get the experience again.
---
How dare they
---
BRD and STRAT were my two favourites. 
---
Followed closes by LBRS and UBRS. 
---
BRD just seemed like such a cool city. Fully formed, lots of stuff happening, a bar, so much to like.
---
It was noticeable in naxx if your guild killed KT since the rings were class specific.
---
that link just makes me want to play female dwarf hunter!
---
Yes, there are quite a few decent drops out there. 
---
I have doubts how well casual eleresto will fare, but I think you will be able to figure out something decent with MC and 20man raid loot.
---
I think you nailed the answer as soon as the word ‚Äúfun‚Äù appeared, and counting the number of flips in a row while traveling will happen more frequently than using stoneform as a dwarf :D
---
Why should I pay $15/month for a game that doesn't get any updates or patches?
---
Servers and GM aren't expensive, private servers do it for free.
---
cuz fuck streamers
---
IMO There will be no content added to Classic.  NONE.  We MIGHT see some bug fixes and possibly some balance changes, and that's a BIG might.
---
They will more likely spend their time and resources putting out Burning Crusade servers.
---
Don't forget Mind Vision!
---
I said it in the OP, but again, I'm not asking for balance on the level of the later retail expansions. I agree completely wrt to the watering down of every spec in legion/BFA. Class homogenization is bad. I don't think anyone will argue with you about that on this sub. However, I think having entire specs that are just useless is bad too.
---
Same with YouTube comments. I used to be a fan of Needle Drop because he brought interesting perspective about albums and people actually had discussions in the comments. Now it's all memes and melon head jokes. 
---
I used to watch Sneaky a whole bunch on Twitch before the insanely childish meme donations became a normal thing.
---
It won‚Äôt fail, at least for a few months. It‚Äôs been an ongoing trend for a while. New xpac people resin play for a bit and subs dwindle. BfA had a higher jump than previous xpacs cause of how it was marketed. It also had a quicker fall when everyone realized it was legion 2.0.
---
Well there you go, don't be disappointed with what class you pick - just pick one you have an interest in papa
---
You're REALLY doing that projecting thing and it's really not helping your case.
---
I know how to express my opinions and communicate effectively. I'm sure you're already emotionally invested enough to browse my reddit account and i'm sure you'll find nothing has been off limits.
---
I get you're trying to paint me in a corner, and I can tell it's because you're genuinely afraid of losing whatever stake you think you have to lose here.
---
I will repeat myself. Learn to let go. People might like you more.
---
I sometimes feel the same but I also know that I have a life now and work and a girlfriend and I won't play the game 13hours a day anyways. So if u don't want to sacrifice your life u get behind anyways.
---
Just play the game at your pace and if u want lvl professions that's great.
---
isnt rag the longest standing because he was technically available at launch though?  So you had to wait for 40 people to get up to 60 and geared.
---
I do use that wen I‚Äôm playing retail however. I was grinding zinrokh and that was an extraprize
---
They can definitely make it feel like a chore and not a game.
---
The amount of time your ninja premade needs to play in order to get R14 the second time will be massive compared to the time your ninja premade needed to play in order to get R14 the first time. Anyone in your ninja premade that ever wanted R14 is shooting themselves in the foot. 
---
All these people have the ability to play just as much as you, they just worked together to make sure they didn't need to. Now you've broken that agreement, so the gloves are off.
---
I'm not saying the next expac will 'fail' in its entirety all I'm saying is if it fails to recapture consistent numbers like Legion did.
---
I understood the upper left square.  The rest looks like retarded screeching.  Let's hope this stays primarily on the streamer servers.
---
You are paying $15 for a retail subscription which gets patched and updates. There is no ‚Äúclassic‚Äù subscription.
---
I figured it went without saying that there will be at minimum 2 million players at launch. I expect even more, closer to 4 million. 
---
So yes, my stance is that if they don‚Äôt have hundreds of servers, depending on capacity and number of layers, there will have to be hundreds of they may struggle for capacity. 
---
If you don‚Äôt think there will be more than 2 million, we can just wait, I‚Äôd be aghast if there are fewer than 2 million.
---
I got mine in vanilla in the scourge invasion patch 1.11
---
Apparently it dropped again in the opening of northrend patch 3.0.2 but I had stopped playing by then which might be what you are remembering
---
Lol it's not talking about the 90's POG game. Teitch saying POG is an acronym for "play/player of game. It's spammed when they see. Streamer (or anyone) do something cool basically.
---
Oh, I have been in Dun Morogh, but probably only the roads from Loch Modan to Ironforge and from Ironforge to Gnomeregan... but that quarry was still a blank area for me ;)
---
I think you're reading far too much into something relatively basic.
---
This whole human tribalism argument is pretty pointless. I'm sure you understand how your argument pertains to almost every facet of social interaction and status, right?
---
I'm having this dilema myself and wondering if it is  possible to mimic shadowmelt with items like Invisible potions and gnomish cloaking device?
---
I just might, taurens always looked badass to me üòé
---
Corrects someone else‚Äôs spelling and then proceeds to type a completely nonsensical sentence.
---
If you can play the game at work sure. 
---
If you can't it's impossible, you need to rank 1 on your server for multiple weeks.
---
Not really, I see it as the opposite. People are looking at the long term plan for Classic and its game style, and while going back to play Classic is the priority that will keep people engaged for well over 2 years, they're eventually going to want to expand on Classic and its style to just keep experiencing a fresh way to play WoW in Classics style.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to make a new expansion just to add to classic. They said if anything they could consider TBC servers if classic is successful.
---
then go back to your pirate server
---
Not sure why I'm getting fucking downvoted, he verbatim suggested that there be a streamer-exclusive realm, dedicated solely to streamers.
---
Holy paladin is obnoxious to level, and I wouldn't recommend it for soloing. Ret/holy is fine, but I'd lean toward pure ret for levelling. A pure ret paladin can heal just fine, especially if your instance group has CC and doesn't pull multiple groups at once.
---
Illumination is great at 60, but not as useful while levelling because you typically won't have the gear/spell crit to support it.
---
For 5 mans, get as much int as possible and bring mana pots. You can get lower level mana pots for cheap, and chug those on boss fights. Pot before you are oom, so that you can pot twice in a fight.
---
For levelling instances, Ret paladin with pots &gt; Holy paladin.
---
But they won‚Äôt. Everyone kept asking for classic well here it is.
---
Is the Tier 0 set any good? I always see the BiS lists around that list anything but T0 for most every class, but wondering if it's any good for Paladins, especially for someone like me running a hybrid build.
---
I see. That does make me feel better, guess we'll see what happens then. Thanks for the response!
---
But the realism though... perpetual war, small gains lots of deaths.
---
Like u/DragonsDomain said, Hunters dmg does drop off around AQ40/Naxx area but they are still needed in raids. However, with you're other two choices, while rogues are popular, I played one in vanilla and had no issues gearing up, running dungeons, or raiding. You just gotta get some people that you vibe with and add them to your friends list. Trust me, that goes a long way.
---
Warriors, on the other hand, are always wanted, they are the best tanks and one of the best dps in the game. So if you wanna run dungeons and don't mind tanking, warrior is great. If you wanna raid, they want warrior dps.
---
So you want everybody to still have to do all the old raids and just keep adding more on top?
---
Too low res
---
Any way one could contribute (e.g. code) to your site?
---
Haha, yea, I hated it at the time, but could not afford the pro version... now it adds a nice touch :)
---
I also thought it was captain cold! but then it's not flash tho
---
Well to each is own. After being a hc raider for years, suddenly leveling without add-ons and vanilla ui was refreshing... and sometimes annoying too but some can deal with things like that.
---
 Cheers homey
---
I would contribute it more to the new game, new raid, people figuring out mechanics. On top of the gaming mentality shift that has occurred since.
---
There weren‚Äôt so many Uber min/max tryhards at launch coordinating like they do now. Wow really brought that whole culture into the mainstream of gaming. Along with the mmo genre.
---
What‚Äôs really different from Rag being in at launch and any other boss in at an expansion launch? You could say the leveling time but the biggest change would be the shift in gaming culture and mentality. 2004 mmo gaming to 2007 mmo gaming are just worlds apart. More so than the leveling time of 1-60 compared to 60-70.
---
At least imo, which may or may not be worth much.
---
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent.
---
Cheers man
---
It‚Äôs literally the same as ‚Äúlmao‚Äù, ‚Äúlul‚Äù, ‚Äúkek‚Äù or ‚Äúwtf‚Äù. Don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs weird just because you got old and can‚Äôt relate.
---
Indeed, I think streaming is hyping up the game but at the same time making viewers play the game through the streams, basically getting people accustomed to classic before it hits is a bad idea imo.
---
Open beta streaming should've been allowed a month at most before release, there's a limit to how much people can get hyped before interests start to wane.
---
If your doing dungeons you should t skip fsde
---
and when your equally skilled it does matter. who cares if you beat on scrubs to make yourself feel better lol

The guy who made this had a great web series called unforgotten realms

i remember jumping into mc via brd back then without having completed attunement, got yellow message and mc instance didnt load
---
Wasn‚Äôt aware legion had any less of a steep drop off than other xpacs. Either way I was just pointing out it will do the same as every xpac since MoP surge and drop.
---
It won't get fixed for a very long time, if it even does. They won't risk messing with too much stuff early on. If you think a certain class, oh I dunno let's say druid, is under balanced then don't play it. I know I love druids but they just have too many problems in vanilla.
---
I have capes turned off for melee classes. Capes look very wizardy and I feel like if you're going to swing a melee weapon you need to have more range of motion in your shoulders - kinda like basketball players and wrestlers wearing sleeveless shirts. I also turn off helmets because 97% of them look really bad and don't fit my outfit, and I wanna see my character!
---
He means per hour he was leveling really slowly, and should be faster per hour this time, regardless of the amount of hours put in per week
---
Worth it to use the older account for future betas and stuff though. Also your bnet name is not displayed anywhere in-game.
---
I'm going to be soloing quite a bit come classic and really enjoy wPvP, 1v1 duels, and BGs. I've narrowed it down to ele shaman, SL lock, or shadow priest.

It's a German server (Gilneas), so the emote is /verbeugen (/bow).
---
Lol. Anyone who started post wrath wouldn't even know what spamming LFG in local meant because of the built in dungeon finder.
---
Different servers had different shorthand for different things, why are people so defensive about this? I played on alliance where a lot of people called it VC, I didn't start the trend, there wasn't any making sense or logic behind it, that's just what it was called on my server. At 10 years old I wasn't going to hop in local and tell people they were stupid for using the only acronym I had ever seen the dungeon be called. I don't think I even realized that the dungeon was explicitly called Dead Mines until way later.
---
I will raid Naxx as an elemental shaman.   Is there a guide for doing this or will I have to make my own?

&gt;All the calculations are described in the GitHub readme linked on the site (Its in the tip when you first load). And as stated there I only look at the HPM, I am working on extending to smarter picks based on other limits, and to introduce spell affecting talents. If you have any specific sources you thing I should consider please comment them here.

Between duskwood, wetlands and southshore these zones were always enough for me to get from 20-30 that guides seems kinda nuts with 11 zones

If TBC had no dailies excpet ilse of queldanas that be perfect amount of dailies and timing in an expac
---
You don't need an in-game addon to make a site better than Wowhead. It's much easier to scrape Wowhead itself.
---
You can't fully experience the retail game without buying the latest expansion, so it's meaningless.

Classes im interested in cant disappoint me later on? That worked out well the first time around...

---
Make it easy on yourself- want to tank? Warrior. Want to heal? Priest. Want to dps? Range? Lock melee? Rogue.
---
If I were to be a popular twitch streamer, I‚Äôd ban all those phrases and shit, except for a select few, so people could still have a bit of fun. But I‚Äôd try to conform my viewership into being not obnoxious. The constant spam grinds my gears so hard because the only way to get a comment out to the streamer is through donation.
---
ofc those 39 people are their followers and the streamers guild will have 100+ people waiting to join if one of the 39 has to leave for some reason
---
Here's why you shouldn't worry about it: the actual mechanics of Classic are noob friendly.  The game is really slowly paced throughout.  You have a lot of time to learn the new stuff, and they drip feed you new stuff sufficiently slowly.  As you can imagine, the slower pace isn't too exciting once you know what you're doing, which is why there's a vocal about try harding and speed running, making their own new challenges.
---
More good news: the way dungeons work in classic, there is no dungeon finder tool, you have to meet up by using chat channels and physically travel to the zone... that means if you suck, you aren't easily replaced ;) people are generally more understanding &amp; there's a lot of time to explain different boss mechanics etc, because every member is invested in the full group succeeding.   Couple that info, with the speed runners &amp; try hards already blew past you, you should have very enjoyable experiences in all the group content you do.
---
I'm very jealous you get to experience this for the 1st time.  You'll have a blast :)
---
Not sure why you come to that conclusion but everyone on reddit is a therapist i guess. Its fine that you didnt read the OP. I was just suggesting you next time do so you can avoid meaningless replies that are adressed in OP already. Everybody wins
---
No, I don't remember that episode of Ed Edd n' Eddy?
---
I got a boost on a recent ps and it cost me 130. Supply and demand I guess.
---
I imagine this seems fair to you but the three randos are about as useful as the second consul of Rome with no army.  Everyone will secretly resent you for having the majority of a loot council being close buddies.
---
Did you read mine? I only say that it should be faster than it was, since it took like 2x what the average is. It was 13 years ago, it was his first time leveling, he was 13 years younger. THE ODDS ARE that it won't take 24 of gametime since he'll probably be more efficient.... but whatever dude get the pitchfork.
---
 it starts at 1g then 5g up to 50g, but it has a timer to reset, so you will only pay 50g if you respec like every day
---
‚ÄúVC‚Äù was commonly used on Bleeding Hollow-US when I started playing around patch 1.6.
---
I mean, obviously some people want super long AVs. I know I do.
---
The point of the old version is that there were more NPCs and they were stronger. This made it extremely difficult to just rush.
---
There was just so much good content in AV. It was more of a zone than a BG. I doubt all that content will get utilized in the 1.12 Version, solely becuase it is less necessary. I know people don't like PvE in their PvP, but that is the shit that makes the game feel like an immersive world.
---
This is just warlock meta, they were fulfilling their class fantasy
---
To be clear I didn't want the daily reward to be there in the first place. And I liked running dungeons before it became part of a daily optimization. 
---
What I am saying is that the time spent 'Improving your character' should be open ended on a day to day basis. I don't want reward structures that on a day to day forces your time to be spent in a certain way.
---
So much discussion on this subreddit has been about second and third order effects of features that Blizzard has implemented e.g. flying mounts, LFR systems etc. I am just highlighting another one that many other players dealt with.
---
Inflation is always a bad thing IMO, due to numerous reasons. However I‚Äôd rather they not nerf anything and instead add more gold sinks. Hopefully whenever we get some more content after Naxx.
---
I'm not sure about blue axes, but I think orc is better regardless due to the racial. Ultimately though, it won't really matter. A recurring theme I keep seeing here is people worrying about BiS lists or races. Most people aren't even going to be close to having all their BiS and most guilds aren't going to kick you if you play a troll or tauren. Just get what you can and start clearing MC as soon as your guild can get 40 people together.
---
When you sign up to be a beta *tester* (yes this is what he signed up for when opting in for beta access), it‚Äôs implicit, if not outright stated, you are there to play the game *and* report issues.
---
Ignore list is a thing
---
Classic doesn‚Äôt even come out until August, I have no idea how this subreddit will stay sane until then.
---
This is like when leet speak was a thing in the early 2000s. Everything was "Ub3r l33t f4g - XxX_Sephiroth_XxX"
---
You forgot "WoW is dead" as a catch phrase, lol. 
---
I am so glad people are having fun, and I am stoked for classic. However, those of us that played vanilla will remember those sorts of folks made it crappy at times, even then. Always gonna be some whiners is a fitting meme point. GJ OP!
---
Actually... it sort of is. The original emote name is "PogChamp" and it was taken from a video involving a pog game. The guy in the emote made said video.
---
I always got Theramore/Stonard. That‚Äôs not what I call fun.
---
It's not easy being green.
---
Click it
---
I don't really care about the cheating aspect. The fact that people like that are the reason we have so many shitty Microtransaction filled games now is what bothers me.
---
T0 is pretty bad, but you'll end up with parts of it anyway (it's not like anyone else is going to take it). T0 is okay for pvp.
---
Usually for hybrid builds, in PvE you want a pure dps set and a pure healing set. In PvP, you can do both.
---
And then there's talbar mantle from that wailing caverns quest which feels like an epic when you get it.
---
&gt; Anyone in your ninja premade that ever wanted R14 is shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Again, if the choice is wait 9 months or go hard it and take it, are they really shooting themselves in the foot ? Isn't that a priority choice ?
---
&gt; All these people have the ability to play just as much as you, they just worked together to make sure they didn't need to.
---
Again you're repeating my main argument, it's all about time investment. I'm saying **IF** you are the ones who are able to dedicate the most time to it, you are in control. That doesn't mean you have to spend all that time grinding, but as long as you can demonstrate it you're the ones who decides who gets rank 14 (exactly like you're saying).
---
Throw in some pointless memes (unlike this one) and it‚Äôs a home run.
---
This is how I feel about twitch chats influence literally everywhere.
---
Cheaper... why would I charge you 1 dollar when I know 100% that you'll pay 2?
---
I don't know how it's literally the same when "kek" is quite literally world of warcraft language (orcish)
---
Ok

Now imagine how does that sound from a businessman Point of view

How are they losing anything by bundling it? 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to play retail then don‚Äôt. Seems simple.
---
The fuck are you talking about man? Don‚Äôt go full boomer on us now. Where do you see this timidness the game isn‚Äôt even out yet..
---
The last 3 frames are the Dota 2 subreddit as well
---
I think we should decommission old raids, they should still exist for primary progression. If new content is added, it should be specific enough to not take away from the primary raid progression design, but additional content to keep the player base from being bored.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how else to address the problem?
---
Holy is definitely worse, Consecrate tanking in low level 5 mans isnt really that good unless you have a bunch of AoE in your group, youll pretty much go OOM every pull if you do use it. Again, unless youre building an AoE leveling group, theres not much reason to even have Consecrate. As for getting threats on multiple targets, slowly, attack 1, Judgement another and rotate attacks, youre not a tanking class, so its not ideal.
---
FoL is pretty much what youll use all the time, if somoene really low and you think they wont die in the next 2.5s, then HL.
---
I honestly couldn't be arsed what specs are in the raid as long they are better than the average player, no drama queens and in for a challenge. Else i wont even join that guild/raid
---
What a lot of people don't know is that each spec sees play now recently anyway due all the new findings in theorycrafting the past 1-2 years. The only specs that has been standing still since forever must be the moonkin. Downranked crit elemental is pretty sick tbh with nonstop clearcasts, pummeler/wolfshide for feral, 21-30-0 enh spec with flametounge, paladin onhit build with chili and shit. 
---
Vanilla is easy if you know what youre doing
---
I've heard that Nelf is the optimal because of base agi. 
---
Dwarves just too cool though. Dwarves are always bros. Thus the correct choice.
---
A way to see what is available PRE raiding (exclude raid loot) or then after that exclude BWL because you're only running MC/Onyx etc.  Would help people decide their own NEXT goal in BIS or just wanted items from their progression in the game.
---
wow thats great , thank you for listening to my words
---
I got Theramore alot, darnassus too.  got ironforge once though so that was cool
---
Where do I find a good PvP guide? I always hear it's a rock paper scissors model, but who is a rock to which scissors and why? Also maybe with team addition and good synergy effects of different classes to each other
---
Best animations horde side.
---
That‚Äôs not classic then. That would become retail. You want classic wow to become retail and follow the same path it already went on?
---
I love using your website to look things up but I tend to get a forever loading page or connection time out and end up having to go to classic wowhead. Is this me or is traffic a bit high on it lately?
---
We should build a wall to keep those fuckin streamers out!
---
The 'cheating' aspect is the entire problem. People don't want to put the effort in anymore so they would rather pay, (Bypass, skip, cheat) call it whatever you want.
---
Fair point. I just remember really being stoked by the changes back in the day.
---
I hear that Decker guy was awesome.
---
I'd rather have dailies than world quests
---
Go Horde. Alliance is the easy side they get more quests, more zones, easier BGs. Winning doesn't mean anything when it's given to you because of imbalances.
---
Fraps vs unregistered hypercam 2
---
A battle as old as time
---
So it‚Äôs their fault you didn‚Äôt buy the expansion? 
---
It‚Äôs not meaningless. You get 14 years worth of content with just having a subscription. For anyone new or returning it‚Äôs a great deal to see everything  that you missed or give you a chance to level before you just boost s toon.
---
If you start streaming now maybe you can get big enough to receive a F&amp;F invite before launch.
---
Hello thanks for the feedback, this sounds interesting but im nut sure i understand it exactly, could you explain more in detail?
---
Best spot to farm light feather, is to find a good goldfarming spot, and use a fraction of the gold to buy them off the auction house.
---
There was just so much good content in AV. It was more of a zone than a BG. I doubt all that content will get utilized in the 1.12 Version, solely becuase it is less necessary. I know people don't like PvE in their PvP, but that is the shit that makes the game feel like an immersive world.  Plus, it was unique to AV. If your only concern is HKs, then AB should be your BG of choice.
---
wait what?!
---
Are you sure? Questing early on should provide more gold. Not sure when the cut-off is where grinding provides more but I thought it's fairly late.
---
I'm actually going to record every time i'll play classic wow. I won't stream or upload to youtube or anything, it will be just for me. I'm just gonna want to make sure i have cool moments like this immortalized. Too bad there's no "record last 2 minutes" option on PC like there is on xbox.
---
Imagine being able to communicate emotions through chat, using emotes.... That's pretty 5Head
---
The canopy, the music, the weather, it wins on all fronts for making you really feel "in" the forest.

Other zones may be more optimal but they've never captured the same wonder as Elwynn for me.

It's less then you think, I run tauren warrior took 15 min or so, by the time I got there was almost lv 3 from exploration exp
---
Great words. Terrible sentence structure.
---
$15/mo for an MMO is the most ridiculous $/hr entertainment budget in the history of entertainment. If an extra $5/mo is the difference between you being able to afford Classic or not, you should probably get off the internet and sort your shit out.
---
You're asking the right question for the wrong reason. Resetting your talents in Vanilla gets prohibitively expensive **fast**, so if you're looking to heal end-game content you'll want your talents set up such that you're able to heal effectively while putting out some half decent damage.  
---
Keep in mind this damage will always be peanuts compared to a dedicated DPS, so the idea of switching to DPS for certain encounters goes right out the window. However, this damage will make your life bearable while farming things solo, especially if your healer is your main.  
---
In terms of what class will be best for this, Priest immediately comes to mind. Their healing output is just so good, it was not uncommon back in the day for guilds to invite PvP-specced Shadow Priests to sub in as raid healers when their healers failed to show up. I've even read stories of Priests healing raids while secretly running a shadow build, and their guilds being none the wiser. There's no armory, and there's no way for people to see your talents in Vanilla.  
---
A distant second would be Druid. As they're much weaker healers, you'll need to devote most of your talent points to the restoration tree. Invest a few key points in Feral and keep a second leather set in your bags, and you'll have the ability to heal dungeons and do some half-decent damage in cat form.
---
Because you know that better than Blizzard?
---
You been getting that last 1-2 days? We swapped hardware and server softwares so it should function better now
---
Dude I could barely handle "LOL, LMAO" and all that other crap when internet chatting came about. I used lol these day but I don't really like he others. Just crabby I guess.
---
Must have misheard, he was a hunter. Such praise was never given to a hunter
---
Except you only get R14 if enough people on your faction contribute enough ranking points.
---
If all the other premades and their guilds just boycott the games, your decision to take over the cartel will fail.
---
Not sure how increasing paying customers means losing potential players?
---
If they separated them they‚Äôd charge you $20 for classic alone, because that‚Äôs how much a vanilla sub is worth today.
---
#nochanges
---
Except people distinctly remember it being called VC and will likely call it that because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what everyone they played with called it‚Äù.  
---
Just let people call it what they want to call it.
---
I‚Äôm really enjoying it this way. It‚Äôs not the fastest but it‚Äôs fun and it brings me back to zones I‚Äôve finished so while I‚Äôm there I pass out food/ drink and help lowbies when the ask.
---
All 3 of those are good PvP specs, as for shortcomings, Id say Spriest is the weakest in WPvP of those 3, Ele Shaman is the least competitive for premades if you dont plan on healing, and SL Lock is kind of all around good.
---
As for some raiding, SPriest is probably the worst, as guilds that run spriests usaully want a very dedicated one. In a casual guild, you can probably get by offspec healing as either Priest or Shaman and just DPSing as SL, but all 3 are gonna be hitting pretty low numbers.
---
High res hair models wtf
---
Lots of time spent farming Isle of Quel'Danas during BC
---
Play pserver. No one is entitled to anything, including you. Blizzard is very good at marketing which is why they chose streamers over players, though many random players still go an invite.
---
I don't think AVI was really a cheat. Wasn't that the one where we could make shapes in the playing field?
---
Or given that TBC doesn't seem to garner the same passionate "#nochanges!" crowd maybe we could get a TBC:Remastered version that acknowledges that flying mounts, dailies, and badge gear were epic fails.
---
Kek is literally a meme from starcraft though so that's not even true.
---
More balanced and polished but still vanilla. All expansion are better on their latest patches
---
I see. I always wondered why it seems no class uses the T0. Do any of them actually use it much outside of 1 or 2 random pieces?
---
US - Shadowsong and Draenor, was definitely VC in Vanilla.
---
Because it's a semi-copypasta/shitpost put into a thesaurus machine. Notice how it's changed "think" to "cerebrate" and "say" to "verbalize" in places that make no sense
---
No they are not. its 15 bucks.
---
But what exactly do you lose by having access to retail? You DON'T have to play it. It's like if you bought a pizza and they gave you bread sticks you don't like for free. It's okay--you don't have to eat the bread sticks.
---
Basically there would be an input box where you could assign points to each stat, so for example if you made Strength equal 1 point, Crit% equal 20 points, and agility equal 0.6 points, an item that gave 10 strength 1% crit and 5 agility would give 33 points.
---
You would use these calculated points to generate a ranking of items for each slot
---
Reaching level 60.  I played at the tail end of vanilla and reached level 54ish then quit because I knew I wouldn't hit 60 before TBC released.  16 year old me was a sore loser.
---
&gt; it's just a reference of an emote from a very specific corner of the internet
---
And kek isn‚Äôt a reference from a specific corner?
---
Stop gatekeeping what is and isn‚Äôt acceptable ‚Äúleetspeak‚Äù in chat.
---
I‚Äôm far from experienced so this is just off what I‚Äôve read and been told but else shaman doesn‚Äôt have a place in raids and is situationally strong in PvP but also heavily gear dependant.
---
Lock is fairly good all around, raid viable for utility, string kit in PvP, won‚Äôt hit huge power spike for PvE damage until Naxx hit gear.
---
Shadow Priest can do well in quite a few 1v1s but you‚Äôd most likely be required to respec heal for raids. 
---
Ultimately I recommend playing whatever you‚Äôll enjoy most. I‚Äôm not sure how accurate everything I‚Äôve said is but hopefully it at least helps a little. Using the discord channel and asking specific questions in the class channels is great for information.
---
Problem is that it's an MMO, how other players play is effecting you. If daily quests pay double the gold/hr than other farming means do, enough people will do dailies such that the pricing of goods on the AH and trade goods between players will be based on that rate of income. Now if you choose not to do dailies because dailies suck, you've basically cut yourself out from the whole economy of the game.
---
Ok I haven‚Äôt gotten any of those I leveled my fishing mostly in Darny (although I‚Äôm human) I remembered it from Vanilla days. 
---
Also some in Redridge but it‚Äôs a gankfest there.
---
I was reading I need to go to Gadgetstan so that will be my next trip I think.
---
So you'd rather the reward not be implemented because you don't like doing the tasks than have the reward available whenever you do feel like doing the tasks.
---
That's pretty fucking selfish.
---
Everything comes out in phases . But every thing is in its most balanced state in 1.12 (atleast in vanilla terms)
---
Main reason I wanna play a mage is portals and food.
---
Windows Key + G, my dude. Windows Game bar.
---
Back in my vanilla days DM was always deadmines and Dire Maul was always said like "LFM DM West".
---
Never saw VC, and if I see it I will correct them.
---
According to the Dev Watercooler, 1.12 represents the most complete version of the Classic experience.  
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic
---
This basically means that they had classes tuned the way they wanted by then, and that this is what Classic was like up until the Burning Crusade pre-patch in December 2006.
---
Content will still be staggered into 6 phases:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
There will always be people who say something funny and there will always be a legion of idiots who inmate them into the ground.
---
I think it‚Äôs just social ineptitude but then again maybe their tastes simply differ from mine.
---
I've been doing the same since the announce of Classic BUT I'm enjoying the hell out of preemptively planning what I'm gonna play. Not sure why it'd make you depressed, I find it immensely fun finding pros and cons (I've probably jumped classes like 7 times now and my GM is getting annoyed me dming him on discord about me switching classes).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
But yea, as I've mentioned, just do a pros and cons list and outweigh whichever is more impactful for your gameplay.
---
I'm an immensely odd and picky guy, probably won't find a guy as odd as me when picking classes so I understand how you feel. To give you my level of OCD here's my thought process initially:
---
I can't play a class/race that has anything associated with Ls because back when I played mmos, people interchange Ls and is in their names and it triggered me to the point of avoiding anything with Ls so I initially decided to play Horde/Orc/Hunter/Engineering
---
I then noticed that Engineering had an L for the gobLin mastery so I decided that I can't avoid all Ls and thought to myself whether I should mitigate as many Ls as possible or just live with Ls.
---
I also noticed there was a griffin on the toolbar and thought "crud griffins are associated with alliance (more specifically dwarves and humans) so now I HAVE to play one of those two.
---
Then I went on the BIS list for all phases and tried to see which classes fully utilized all tier sets and came down to three class choices (Hunter, Priest, Prot Warrior).
---
I also had a thing where I wouldn't play a class unless it fully utilized all racials a race had to offer. I also had a thing where the class icon had to match with what my character used (ie, the warrior icon has a sword so I HAVE to use a sword).
---
So yea I'm still thinking about all the possibilities, looking up combinations and looks in wowhead dressing room, trying to fit the professions lorewise with the classes, all the while trying to minmax each class when I do play them.
---
I completely understand what you're going through but the difference is I'm having a ton of fun doing this.
---
Make a pros and cons list and outweigh them to eachother and choose that way.
---
Balance, game breaking big fixes.
---
Jesus Christ, I‚Äôm the man in the door way and part proud part ashamed.
---
Just because you feel the need to make assumptions about people you don't know does not mean they're correct.
---
Get over yourself.
---
/join world
---
Good point, but what if I hate the endgame of the class I loved to level?
---
What.
---
&gt;There is a vast power difference here.
---
Welcome to Classic? Classic was never fair. If you accidentally rolled up on a guild leader, he could call his entire guild to come out and camp you until you logged off and everyone would put you on a kill on site list. If you stole his node, you were blacklisted from all raiding in his guild and a fair number of the other top guilds that shared a list.
---
No one is denying that Streamers have ridiculous power, or that they won't abuse the fuck out of it. It still won't be any different than Classic, if anything, this is probably better. That guild leader had no accountability and his guild took his word as law. A streamer is literally streaming his evidence live. The viewers will judge him if he accuses someone unjustly. Being a streamer is a double-edged sword. They may hold a lot of power, but that power can and will easily turn on them. Viewers are fickle.
---
Save the crying for launch when/if he actually gets away with anything bad, until then you are just shitting up this sub for no reason and you look like a child.
---
Probably yes but there are no official specs and this will be low for retail. 
---
Classic seems to be have lower requirements than retail but it depends on how much lower.
---
Hellfire does more dps. But then the warlock will just draw aggro and die so no point.
---
That might work on a low pop server, where there's basically no competition anyways.
---
Stamina and utility items (Mostly trinkets and engi items) win pretty much every fight, some classes get away with it more than others but a general rule is the more stamina you have the more you'll succeed. Obviously if you're comparing a BWL item with a pre raid item then the BWL one is almost definitely going to be better even if it somehow has less stamina due to other stats but if both items are the same tier then usually more stamina is the best choice.
---
I doubt they add anything. They're most definitely going to do a TBC though, that will bring back way more players than Classic simply because the game had way more subs at that point and it's more related to retail.
---
Which is fine, since it basically returns control of private sever populations to Blizzard again which is a good business decision for them.
---
I almost expect a TBC classic announcement at BlizzCon lol
---
Is leveling fishing enough to level cooking also?
---
Maybe, but me and my buddies also dont care much about getting ourselves loot. We just want to have fun and raid. Also we hardly ever agree on things so those 3 random people will actually be the deciding factor.
---
They are losing people cause they put it will the retail subscription? Oh yeah who told you that information?  Vanilla cost $15 back then. It cost $15 a month now.
---
If you force new guilds to take each step one at a time you will slow them down and make them unappealing to new players would could join an older guild doing newer stuff. 
---
If you keep updating gear in the old raids then people end up in some nightmare of raiding MC BWL AQ Naxx and let's say karazan + uldum or something every week. It's too much
---
You didn‚Äôt detect any rogues because THEY ARENT THERE
---
It worked on Mannoroth. One of the highest PVP population servers in the US.
---
Actually, they said they wouldn't do classic because they couldn't until Omar showed that it was possible by creating the prototype of the main client interpreting vanilla code. Alterac Valley changes is something entirely possible, and they can create in any way they want, that's not really a valid argument.
---
On one hand, you use the 'evolving culture' argument to justify your actions online, but then turn around and talk about protecting your culture from dilution. Don't you see how disingenuous that is? You're changing your thinking paradigm not from argument to argument, but literally from comment to comment.
---
I've also seen you use the 'reading too much into it' argument on anyone who objectively calls you out when you're acting like an asshole. I've heard many refer to this type of behaviour as 'Schrodinger's Asshole'; you say something shitty and then decide based on the responses how serious you were about it.
---
I'm not saying this toxic culture doesn't belong in gaming; I'm saying it doesn't belong anywhere. And I simply loooooove this:
---
&gt; There is no point in trying to twist my words. It might just be easier  to take a look at what i'm saying and move on. Am I really worth your  time? 
---
Not really, but the people reading on are definitely worth my time, and deserve to see that there's more to this community than your narrow, toxic view of it.
---
And by the way, logically showing the flaws in your arguments and that you're being an asshole, is not twisting your words.
---
They're becoming legends.
---
Although I do love BF for some reason Ive always preferred Nightslayer.
---
Flips, 10/10.
---
He has retail brain, where you must get rewards otherwise it was a waste of time.
---
Sadly this is also my reason. I also can‚Äôt play certain genders or races based on running animations
---
Seconding laughing skull. Fucktards on this sub need to understand that different servers called it different things and that there's no definite answer.
---
Yes, I actually am happy with class balance in vanilla. There are some glaring problems but we have seen long-term with the live game that fixing them and bringing everybody close to one-another results in bland homogenization. You lose the actual class flavor and become archetypes with different graphics.
---
Vanilla also had a much bigger "teamwork" element than WotLK did. To that end, I think "paladins heal, maybe you can go ret when we have this on farm" falls into that scope. Take one for the team and fill the role they need, just like the 39 other people in your raid are doing.
---
Class balance wasn't ideal in Vanilla, I don't think anybody actually argues that. But in my opinion it's still in a far better state than the homogenized mess on live. I thought TBC class balance hit a sweet spot, but I don't think you could just plunk that into classic without breaking everything from leveling to end-game content. A lot of post-60 talents and added abilities that make those specs more viable would have to be shuffled around to different level brackets as well as everything--***everything***\--re-tuned to compensate.
---
What's VC I only know DM.
---
Mage with tailoring, enchanting is best imo as you will be killing to level up anyways and they also supplement each other as well as alts can supplement them with extra greens.
---
Sadly no guild/raid would take an elemental shaman in a raid as hard as Naxx. Fights are extremely long and the one thing that makes elemental shamans useless in raids is that they have MAJOR MAJOR mana problems. Even in the easiest raids with the bosses that get downed relatively quickly elemental shamans basically don‚Äôt exist because they go OOM half way through the fight even with mana potions. In Naxx you will literally be standing there with an empty mana bar for half of the fight. Sure your totems could be useful but restoration already has that covered and an enhancement shaman with Nightfall already is speccing into better totems. In a raid as hard as Naxx if everyone is not pulling their own weight respectably, no progress will be made
---
Mines were removed in 1.7, no?
---
At least the dog based babytalk has a real life precedent. People turn to mush around dogs. Its normal.
---
It was also so the lower leveled players had something they could do without getting completely wrecked by maxed level players with amazing gear.
---
I too will be questing in AV.
---
That doggo did a heckin‚Äô zoomie 13/10 would pet.
---
&gt;I won't, but I am already too much gone.
---
The Cataclysm fight was great though.
---
The fundamentals are not hard, but real speed running and making use of a speedrunner‚Äòs guide is a totally different level.
---
Ok i understand. Sounds interesting thanks!
---
Isn‚Äôt this backwards? Cast the out of combat spells first then pull?
---
It's not really a big deal if you switch classes. When I played vanilla I started with a Rogue  level him to 34 then switched to hunter then stopped at 20 and rolled ANOTHER hunter on a different server.  
---
If I could go back and do it again I would do it the exact same way. The memories are priceless to me. That lvl 34 rogue is still on my account, untouched since Vanilla.
---
1. One consistent world. No cross-realm zones, grouping or sharding. You share one world with your server, and that consistency gives meaning to interactions (whether it's a friendly guy you end up grouping with time and time again as you keep running into each other, or a guy that keeps ganking you). That's paramount to an MMO.
---
2. Gearing. Items are scarce and last you a good while, which makes me feel much more satisfied when I get one (compared to latter iterations of WoW). In addition, I like the weird itemization of vanilla. It makes the items feel handcrafted and unique, rather than the product of a streamlined mass production facility that hands out loot to all bosses. Having some items be outright bad for you is also a positive thing in the long run IMO, as it makes the items that are good for you feel all the more impactful.
---
3. Spell batching. Yes, it was frustrating at times, but for pvp it added so many layers of additional mechanics that made the game much more fun and interesting in my opinion.
---
I get that. I don't get the spamming. Imagine if every single comment on a /r/funny post was just "LMAO LMAO LMAO LMAO LMAO LMAO LMAO LMAO". That's what twitch chat is like.
---
Yeah you're right.
---
The routes won't be anything special if everyone knows them.
---
It‚Äôs a huge zone. Or at least it feels like it
---
There isn‚Äôt likely to be ‚Äònew‚Äô content added for what you‚Äôre referring to. In terms of leveling I wouldn‚Äôt worry about faction for that. Think about what race you want to play/be surrounded by.
---
"depressed" may not be the right word, "obsessed" could fit better.
---
One way is to reroll and enjoy for 120-200 more hours :D Another way is to of course take the endgame into account. But IMO one shouldn't overthink the endgame too.
---
cool man

Let it go old man. Let loose, live a little. Smoke up.

You're trying to make your agreement on school grounds, and clearly that's quite a poor attempt to argue.

---
FD and shadowmeld drop the flag in WSG.  I‚Äôm not sure how you expect to ‚Äúget out of range‚Äù when the mage would be running at you to try to return the flag.
---
&gt; Blizzard is losing a lot of potential players by making the choice to bundle the subscriptions
---
What? No they're not, no one is going to look at classic and be like "uh, I'm not paying that if I get something else for free"
---
You want to start auto attacking the next mob as soon as possible, so best to pull right away with flame shock.
---
&gt;And I am glad the german WoW community is different.
---
Oh god, the authoritarian German is getting mad. We're in trouble now
---
I can remember how excited i was to finally get a hat. I think it was some blue hood for level 21, i levelled very hard to get to that level! 
---
I can't wait to play classic again üòÅ
---
I get it. It was fun for me too and kind of helped pass the time at work, but im losing hope. I did everything you mentioned, pros and cons, everything. Probably just gonna end up playing druid anyway, at least i know i'll like it if TBC drops.
---
It's more than just modern wow, the entire gaming industry has moved towards maximizing instant gratification.
---
Fire Blast for instant cast damage?
---
When ? I actually played on Mannoroth (I was in VtS) up until AQ launched. I remember having some awesome rivalries there, but I can't ever remember there being some sort of pvp boycott.
---
I'm a relatively old gamer and I also believe some things in classic are overkill, i think after a while I will quit as it will feel more and more as a waste of time.
---
Thanks for the comment. I haven't played Vanilla since 2005, did ele shaman still have to deal with a million totems?
---
You can immediately pick the flag back up. The hunter is moving except for the split second he feign deaths and shadowmelds, while the mage is standing still casting polymorph.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a movie about a college frat house named Kappa Kappa Kappa?
---
LULW
---
I think the vast majority of players call deadmines AND dire maul DM. And unless you're retarded, you know which one is being referred to based on the player's level and the overall context so it rarely needs to be specified. People are defensive now because you have a handful of people saying that VC is 'right,' and the resto f the playerbase is like... Well maybe it was 'right' on your server, but not overall. And those people are correct
---
I asked Traque (aruably the best Hunter) about this a while ago. This is what he said on the Dwarf vs Night Elf subject:
---
*Night elf is actually way better than Dwarf in my opinion. Dwarf is basically only useful rogue's poisons, dealing with rogue is not really hard as hunter if you have the proper tools. Whereas night elf has that amazing spell being shadowmeld.* 
---
*You can use it in many ways, whether it is to set up an ambush or hide from opponents. If it was only that, then it would have been a tie, but you can also combo Feign Death with Shadowmeld since it brings you out of combat to stop your opponents from casting twice in a row, this is super valuable considering casters are the hardest classes to deal with as a hunter.* 
---
*So basically, Nelf is better as their racial ability is way more reliable in almost every matchup (+ it's super fun)*
---
Pros: 1/4 chance to outright resist a stun. This makes orc rogues supreme for fighting other rogues. Bloodlust is a nice damage boost to a locked down target. 
---
Cons: Pet Damage increases with worthless. Axe Specialization is also worthless. 
---
Armor also looks cool as fuck. I would say if you wanna PvP go orc for fighting Paladins, Warriors, and Other rogues. Undead rogue is good against priests and absolutely nullify warlocks.
---
All you have to do is FD-trap.  You don‚Äôt need to SM it would just cost you another global and put it on cool down.
---
An orc would honestly be at an advantage as he has a good chance to resist concussive shot and scatter shot.
---
A lot of changes occurred during the life of vanilla. And patch 1.12 is the most balanced of those patches.  And allows them to not have to make drastic changes throughout the life of classic.
---
Very true. Casual gaming makes the money now days, and that's why I'm so thankful for Classic.
---
Stockades for sure.  You had to run all the way from the Stranglethorn Zeppelin and fight your way into Stormwind just to take care of the opposing faction's prison riot.
---
Why would they spend so long and do beta tests, stress tests, have everyone send in on the beta the bugs, recommend with screenshots as well, have private servers for a long time, if they didin‚Äôt want to take out the bugs.
---
I don't get why people are so desperate for beta keys... It's a beta. All "progress" is irrelevant for the players and the sole purpose is to test the game.
---
I can't wait for launch, but if I played beta, I would probably burn myself out like an idiot.
---
Well theres a lot you can do, I certainly wouldnt Bloodrage AFTER the pull, its a waste of a global. I understand the idea behind getting a block to guarantee a Revenge, but its really not worth it when tanking multiple mobs, youll be generating a good amount of rage and you want to convert that to threat as fast as possible, Sunder pretty much all the time and replace it with Revenge whenever it happens to proc. Pretty much only use Shield Block if you know you have solid threat on everything.
---
As for pulls, a lot of Warriors are afraid of this, but Charge pulls can be really effective, dont get too gung ho with it and pull an entire room, but anytime you can do it safely, you should. If youre not charge pulling, defensive stance, Bloodrage, pull, Sunder. Rotate targets and Sunder all of them, favoring the main DPS target.
---
As for sudden spawns and asspulls midfight and such, you cant just do everything at once, obviously you have Challenging Shout if the CD is up, but if you dont you have to prioritize. Save the healer, get a Thunder Clap or Demo Shout on the group to pull them to you and get initial threat and start Cleaving/Sundering, assuming this is midpull, you should have a enough threat on the old mobs that they wont aggro the healer. Every DPS has some sort of CC, stun or ability to take hits, some healers do too, but not while their healing. If the healer dies, the group dies, let the DPS handle themselves.
---
The leveling/questing experience. Class quests, long epic questlines that take you all over the world and sometimes take 10+ levels to complete, normal mobs actually being challenging again, etc.
---
That's because you weren't on Horde.
---
For proffesions does the info for retail on places like wowhead give me good outline of where what to farm? Or, is there a better way to find this info because I'm not familiar with many reliable sources? Also I'm looking for a data base not just Mr joey YouTube's ultimate classic professions guide
---
I forgot that in vanilla you could learn highest version of some skills via books. Any1 have link to list of such books?
---
I'm not going to be joining a super hardcore PvE guild so I think I'll be ok for raids with any spec/class. At the same time, it won't be something that's top priority for me so even if I'm not invited every time, it's not a big deal. I haven't played Vanilla since Vanilla so I'm not sure what I'd enjoy, all I have to base my decision on is research and foggy memories.
---
And giant blogs about how special WoW is to you posted here because you think people care.
---
Weapon skills are 0.04%, it's barely relevant for tanks. Glancing blows too - the vast majority of attacks of shield warriors and druids are yellow.
---
I think that dw tanks will still be the case though. Even if boss parries a lot, it's still not something unhealable. One parry only adds 0.24 swing in average.
---
It's a shame how that server pretty much died in wrath.
---
My first ever toon was a Night Elf Hunter and that‚Äôs exactly what I plan to roll in Classic for all the nostalgia feels.
---
Honestly, I am jealous of you.
---
You're in for a great time. Youre gonna a get ganked. Youre not going to be the best.
---
But all the content will be brand new. You are going to have so much fun.
---
Just be ready for a few grindy periods (lvl45-49, and lvl58+).
---
I don't know a lot about processor graphics.  Its technically below the min specs for legion (Intel HD Graphics 5000).  I looked up a comparison between your 4400 and the 5000 (https://www.notebookcheck.net/HD-Graphics-4400-vs-HD-Graphics-5000_4575_4574.247598.0.html).  That site compares them both to the 4000, saying the 4400 is about 20-30% faster than the 4000 and the 5000 is about 50% faster than the 4000.
---
I would love a copy of this to use as wallpaper.
---
LOL I'm 22 and someone wrote 'lulw' and I asked why they are adding the w at the end.
---
Thank you very much!!
---
It entirely depends on which race I settle on and which racial mount I want to eventually ride.  I am currently tempted to roll a Gnome warrior and corpse run up through Wetlands to level in all of the Night Elf zones so I can ride cats.
---
Why update gear in old raids? We should leave it alone. ClassicWoW at its core should always remain the way it was in Vanilla. 
---
Anything extra should be side content for the sake of fun.  Add an insane level difficulty to Kara, but keep the gear at par with t3 with low drop rates. The point isn‚Äôt to ‚Äúforce‚Äù new guilds into new content, but to create updates worth to keep players interested and busy if desired. 
---
When I raided back then, you didn‚Äôt go out of your way to raid MC and BWL when you were already at a Naxxramas level. You‚Äôre never forced to do anything, but have something for your guild to explore/experience at the level they‚Äôre at.
---
Perfect example of someone abusing thesaurus.com right here. 
---
A thesaurus is meant for people who know how to use them, and you clearly do not.
---
Well, other than kek lmao/lul/wtf are all acronyms of existing words. And leet speak is just substituting numbers for letters and spelling words weird.   
---
Things like Monkas, Poggers, and Kappa are new "made up" words, and are spammed unceasingly in larger channels, which lowers the quality of chat immensely. So anyone who says those things outside of those large channels is, rightfully or not, associated with that kind of spammy obnoxious behavior that makes actual conversing impossible.
---
cuz Blizz are lazy
---
Imagining the Seagulls screeching out ‚ÄúPog Pog Pog Pog Pog‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem too far fetched
---
The bigger problem for horde locks is threat management. Paladins give you salvation and on horde you won‚Äòt be in the shaman group.
---
Ok?
---
It's not perfect l but Hunter can play PvP with their cookie cutter raid spec more than fine without lacking many PvP focused talents.
---
Whoopsie.
---
I‚Äôve thought about this myself man, we don‚Äôt realize how much time we sink into until you /played...I would still recommend playing. 
---
Later in the game you can just raid log and casually pvp. I would recommend this, if your standing in org or IF for more than 15 minutes with nothing to do. Log out, go do something else
---
Fuck darkedge, jammy is bae.
---
Ok, I guess. I feel like I would've noticed if our top rivals stopped showing up though, but maybe not.
---
Now I feel bad.
---
i always try to collect as many recipes as possible :)
---
Same, I want to play a resto shaman but I feel like I'll just get my butt clapped in world pvp while I'm trying to pick flowers all the time
---
&gt;Also, I refuse to pay a monthly fee that is inflated because it's bundled in with a game I don't want to play (BfA). 
---
Thanks to inflation its actually cheaper than it was back in the day. And yeah i dont like it being bundled with BfA either, but even if it didnt include BfA it would still cost the same making your argument childish and very stupid tbh.
---
Personally I think it's funny, I say Pog all the time cuz that whole culture is fucking hilarious imo but everyone has a different sense of humor
---
Where did all these 1.12 p servers come from? I thought all the prominent psevers had to reverse engineer from wrath or tbc?
---
1) Thanks a lot for your hardwork! I have been using your website since it's up and it helped me a lot. 
---
2) In january i started classes to become a developper too, if you ever need some free labor, (small corrections, testing, w/e)  reach out! I am thinking of some small projects to start as soon as i have a bit more experience and time (still working at the same time but looking to reduce hours).

Fluent in SQL (been working &gt; 1 year). Currently being introduced to  c#, c++, php, js.

Except if they start losing, they just run away.
---
That's the problem with Paladins. They never really lose 1v1, but you're opponent can just run away.
---
4 totem types, in raiding, you only realistically use 3 at a time and in PvP, whatever you happen to need at the time, usually like 2 at a time.

They convey facial expressions/emotions/feelings/thoughts real quick + mob mentality.

Pogchamp is used to convey hype for example. You see it and you know something cool happened (or that people are impressed).
---
When 20k-30K people are in a chatroom. It's impossible to read/follow what people say. So you use emoticons.

Think of it as protesting in a large group or something. You go with the group and use visuals (signs) to express your thoughts/emotions. If you want to get a better understanding of it, just go to twitch and check a stream with relatively few people (below a thousand), and compare it to the top streams with 50K viewers. 
---
Hopefully I explained it clearly. Sorry if I didn't.
---
DKP. That's a good one.
---
The brewing toxicity in here is wild. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when a hundred thousand people are forced to wait months in anticipation and all we can do is watch other people (who let‚Äôs face it are mostly pretty annoying) enjoy what we‚Äôre waiting for.
---
So what your saying is "classic isn't worth the same fee as BFA"...?
---
And irl only comes once
---
(((THEY)))
---
Damn this looks like srgrafo‚Äôs artwork, very spot on!
---
Check out QuissyTV. They're both pretty chill and their chat moves at a calm pace last I watched.
---
I personally dont think they should get to 60 and play endgame content
---
Thanks for making me fucking choke on my lunch! (I agree, only time I've ever voted for him too roflol)
---
You're right on the money with that one. I did spent a lot of time jumping around in circles
---
Nah man, fuck streamers! /s
---
Stop being poor
---
IRL comes all the time?
---
Read it again, but as a normal person.
---
Yeah man we all do it, I would hate to see time played of just that lmao
---
As far as addons go, people used more addons in vanilla than they do now, and the addons could do much more powerful things than now. It is true that things will be easier now but addons are not the reason.
---
Just need heals, PW:Shield, and a wand.
---
Darkedge was an Edgelord before the term was coined.
---
yes I know, but even then you need to parae it against your whole gear to get the correct results.
---
Else you could just sort by item level &amp; certain stats
---
one person around... one fucking person that isn't even fucking you. so how does that ruin YOUR experience??? This is what i mean by when i say people think the world revolves around them. the STREAMER is being followed and fucked with, not YOU. not everything is about YOU. The only person pretending other players don't exist is you thinking you're the most important player in azeroth.
---
in vanilla there was no cooldown on public channels.
---
I appreciate your integrity. I disagree with the notion that twitch chat in a popular stream is the same as‚Äúroflmao or epic win‚Äù. From my perspective or memory when those terms were used by me or my friends it was in a conversation. We were communicating as a group. The twitch chat lingo, at least to me, seems to be a shout into the void almost. You‚Äôre responding to the streamer yeah, but nobody is receiving or responding to your response. To me it‚Äôs fundamentally different
---
I don‚Äôt think classic servers will have small pop. This sub is already at 130k subscribers, more than some other existing MMOs.
---
Waiting for classic actually helped me rekindle my love for dota. I needed something to hold me over and it seems like dota is doing just that.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to tell you but ‚Äúsquad of mages‚Äù you saw were most likely controlled by one neckbeard who consumes copious amounts of the Dew and spends his days eating Doritos in a chair he‚Äôs gotten too fat to get out of. 
---
Also if you beat him in PvP he would have literally died of heart failure (South Park anyone)
---
Not to mention do a fucktonne of work that will be invalidated later.
---
&gt;I wouldn't trade anything for some of the experiences I had in Vanilla
---
What's the regret then? Your life consists of the experiences. The experiences form your life.
---
If one looks from a half-empty "what if" point of view, there's always a room for regret. What if I weren't typing this comment but would paint a picture? But these negative regrets only drag you down.
---
During that accumulative year, you had a lot of enjoyment. It's the most and only important thing. And this is why you are tempted to try it again.
---
And don't overthink the damn price. Even a minute of happiness is well worth $9 USD a month.
---
which still means wasted cpu seconds that you can use to simply do a DOS.
---
you need to stristically analyze hour regex
---
I can't wait to pay $60 a month for my enjoyment of destroying in pvp
---
&gt;it's hard to get around the horde cities
---
How? It's no different than getting around Alliance cities. Maybe you were just more used to alliance cities
---
The one downside of classic - no Dalaran crater portal.
---
Hi, /u/Jbuky
---
Amen to this. I hate streamers, with all their fanboy followers.. hopefully they will play on a server and a strange Russian guild will beat their asses. Can‚Äôt wait till classic so I watched my first stream ever from asmongold, total garbage
---
&gt; I don't like the huge groups of people and overpopulation.
---
The game is going to be sharded though. So one server will have 9000 people, but only 1000 or so will be on your current shard. This is getting removed after the first few weeks as peoples levels are spread out a bit more.
---
I leveled my first char as mining+herbalism while flipping ores to bars or bronze bars and saved greens and clothes to become a tailor+enchanter later on during wotlk but I think its not feasible with relatively cheap netherweave/frostweave bags. I had enough mats and gold to full both professions and buy epic flying by the time I hit 80.
---
Hunters can get rank 14 if the premades decide to give it one. Hunters will have raid spots but your going to have s lot of competition for a spot.
---
&gt; before the insanely childish meme donations became a normal thing
---
Oh man, when people turn text to speech on and all it turns into is donations for 4.20 with meme text, so fucking stupid.  I want to know how many of those donations get charged back when mom or dad find out that Timmy used their credit card for stupid shit, or more pathetically, how many are basement losers with literally nothing better to spend what little amount of money they do have on Twitch donations.
---
nope... spoiler alert.
---
in the toilet.
---
Dude... you can't blame a streamer for thousands of people in an event that has always been popular as fuck... Stop giving streamers so much fucking credit.
---
Well you've realized in the end the time you have already spent in it was not worth it. I'm curious why $6-8 would persuade you enough to go against your own realization though. Quite confusing
---
enhancement shaman suck ass
---
.04% in 5 categories is .2% per skill point. 1% for 5... not as irrelevant as you make it out to be.
---
Almost certain that DW tanks will not be the case considering 14% affects both my and oh tables. Even with weapon skills up you‚Äôre at say 13% 13.5%. DW tanks are a newer thing on pserver meta as well. Not something that was the meta even 3 years ago.
---
R14 has more to do with premades than class
---
You'll find a guild in need of a hunter and have no issues. Fewer loot competition than most classes as well. Hunters are decent in wPvP as well
---
Whats that?
---
Regex takes a bit to learn how to use effectively, you can search google for regex tutorials if you're interested
---
Is there an auction addon which lets you sort by buyout price, rather than bid price?
---
.... kamel√•s√•!
---
Yeah so asmon can use having his guild name stolen as content. All this hate just gives them attention and money.
---
I understand it can seem that way from an outside perspective, but being privy to experiencing both waves I can say emote based conversation or slang has become a real thing.
---
These terms are used quite liberally and I think just as effectively for communication having been around for both internet culture in the early 2000's and now.
---
It doesn't sound like you should go back. Playing games should be a fun and relaxing experience while enjoying life.
---
And also fuck retail, right guys? Upvote me!
---
Don't be judgemental, he's a gnome he can't reach the punctuation keys !

Hunters are definitely worth playing. They are amazing in every field except LATE GAME PvE. In Molten Core and Ony they actually have the potential to out-damage Locks and Mages. They are lowest damage with Blackwing Lair but not by too much. They only really fall off in AQ40/Naxx but their damage can still be okay on some fights that are highly based on threat (because Feign Death is amazing for threat management). In every other field Hunter dominates. Basically nothing counters them in PvP and if played correctly a hunter can shit on almost every class. For solo play they are also amazing as they can make money farming Marudon solo and they can also solo many elite enemies. Even in raids as late as AQ40/Naxx they are still mandatory to have because they have Tranq shot (raid spots will be tight though because you only really need 2 hunters)
---
Hunters are good in pvp, but r14 is more about no lifing in premades.
---
Hunters have raid spots but most wont take more that 3 or 4 and a lot of people roll hunter.
---
There was a difference?.. I started as a gnome mage.
---
&gt; more knowledgeable with WoW
---
That's why there will be more minmaxing this time around.
---
But how does one person getting items from other people affect YOU as an individual? You all act like if the streamer wasn't gonna get those items you would. Just because the streamer is on the server doesn't mean jack fucking shit. You act like if he wasn't there you'd have thousands of gold, naxx world first and scarab lord.
---
Because it's literally what we demanded of them every day for a year straight. Does 1.12 #nochanges ring a bell?
---
If you're going to be putting the effort needed in to get R14, literally any class is going to be viable to do that, it's a time commitment more than anything else.
---
As for viability in raid spots, you'll get raid spots as a hunter, not many but you will. If you're R14 chances are you'll more than likely be geared/prepped and more chance of an invite. You won't top damage as a hunter but w/e.
---
sick low quality text to speech money grabbing content dog
---
One for the archives. Here the Blizzard CM's discuss Paladin (poor) performance in the Test of Honor contest, and one in particular is given a task he will not enjoy.
---
Yup. That‚Äôs why I said with nightfall it‚Äôs okay. They are simply a buff bot at that point but I won‚Äôt complain cause that buff is amazing and if a shaman is willing to literally just auto attack all raid to boost mages and locks I‚Äôm cool with it. (Plus the weapon is expensive as fuck)
---
If you can‚Äôt afford $15 a month, don‚Äôt play.
---
New content like finishing Tol Barad, Hyjal in classic, Karazan 20 man and The Emeral Dream would be badass
---
This was great
---
"Thousands more".
---
Have you never watched an asmongold stream?
---
Just don't play it. It's the same sub fee as it was back in 2004. Having a lower price would equal a change and #nochanges still apply.
---
Post is also talking about Pre-Dire Maul
---
How stupid are you if you don‚Äôt know about the beta release while playing WoW...
---
‚ÄúHmm, what‚Äôs this giant photo of ragnaros doing on my launch screen! Must be nothing‚Äù
---
All my screenshots we're on an old PC from high school. That hard drive is long gone.
---
I'm sick of the whining posts about a subscription lately. Eat fast food a couple less days a month or play this instead of Netflix. If you're stressing the cost, you're communicating much more that needs to be addressed then playing this game
---
Since we're riding the Paradosi nostalgia train, enjoy this.

Generally there's a good Hunter population, so I'm not sure that will be very high demand.
---
Yup, or even the balance/resto druid build too
---
Rogue 100%
---
I like the female model a lot more! The‚Äôre armour fit alot better. And your smaller as a rogue
---
Eh. People carry around 2 sets of gear sometimes, or in raids if you needed resist set. Profession mats, stuff you farmed etc. So while you can quickly dump some off at bank, then you have to go all the way back to where u were unless you get a summon. So still have to set aside a whole bag at least to store all those stacks before a raid.
---
Many people play the race they want, not the minmax :)
---
Entirely aesthetic 
---
Fem orcs look cool
---
Male orcs meh, but you have the biggest shoulder pads tho
---
This made me lol irl, good job.

Chuck Norris‚Äôs Anal Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is a drop in Vire Caul.

I have seen clips and a few videos i dont normally. But yes he can call upon people for a raid, but you act like someone else won't do that... Just because others aren't streaming doesn't mean that they wont do that... you understand that there are gonna be guilds with 100's of people running around fucking shit up right? And no asmongold has never had a fucking thousand people running around with him either. Stop blowing shit out of per portion.
---
I‚Äôm planning on being a troll warrior. Never been a Troll before. Super excited

They cant test it internally. No need to les everyone see.

There's a difference between

&gt;We aren't doing classic 5 years ago

To

&gt; We're using a this specific system for this battleground. 
---
They aren't going to change something 2 months before it releases.
---
Female dance.
---
I did in fact have a Shaman in Vanilla, and enjoyed it a lot.
---
If you can only enjoy a class because it has "mad dps", then I pity you, and may I recommend you find a game more suited to your taste.
---
Havent played those games but have yet to find any game that I enjoy dailies even if they change. I much prefer to just go off and do my own thing with out the feel of missing out because I didnt do X today.
---
on launch day, the excitement, the nostalgia, the "we're finally home bros!" feeling is gonna last about 5 minutes, and then someone is gonna tag the wrong mob at the wrong time and piss off the wrong person. then the pent up toxicity is gonna explode.
---
hopefully I'll miss the worst of it because I will be sleeping for work/at work for the first few hours of launch. maybe when I get home the shitstorm will have mostly blown over. mostly...
---
Perhaps you're right about the weapon skills. 
---
But I see no reason to bury dw tanks just because more mh/oh attacks will be parries. Extra 8% chance to get extra 0.48 damage within mh/oh swing timer of some 1.5 seconds. It's like a soft crit, and crits can be healed (as all bears know heh).
---
Even with nightfall, he isn't worth bringing.
---
Female orc proportions are much better.
---
That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm worried about.
---
Using terms like "forced to wait months in anticipation" is feeding the toxicity.
---
Can't link atm but look up hakurai's 1-60 alliance leveling guide on YouTube for a different route, it avoids the pvp contested zones until 30. For speed though darkshore is a must
---
Troll gets Bezerking for better threat gen and is objectively cooler. 
---
OP, I assume youre a human being IRL. Imagine being a human playing a fantasy game in which you are still a human. Furthermore, that WoW race subsists on a diet of tofu and soy.
---
Choice is obvious.
---
Big time boomer post right here.
---
I'm going with female orc, their gear and animations look much better
---
I want to main a PvP holy paladin but I‚Äôm  worried that I‚Äôd never be able to kill anything in world PvP.
---
In vanilla, I maimed a mage and got up to r11.
---
I played until Wotlk where I pvp‚Äôd seriously and was able to unlock my t2 weps ( 2200+), which made world PvP so much fun.
---
I‚Äôm confident in minmaxing gear/engineering, and I understand healers aren‚Äôt meant to purely dps, but I don‚Äôt want to be able to get attacked and just not be able to defend myself, that sounds like hell.
---
I don‚Äôt remember how holy could do 1v1 in world PvP and obviously most of the time I‚Äôd be running with others, but can a holy Paladin donanuthing against a mage/warlock at all?
---
I feel like a holy Paladin couldn‚Äôt even kill a level 55 mage if the mage just pollied and mounted up.
---
Any ideas?
---
Tauren is better against classes that dont rely on stuns
---
Because tons of lackies fanboying 1 or 2 people ruins the server. And im obviously not saying thats gold that would have gone to me, that's a disgusting misrepresentation of my point of view. If you think a server having a couple of stupidly overpowered people on it has no effect then you have no idea what wow was like before cross server.
---
This seems like it was written by a teenager who thinks he is smart. Good writing is communicating well, not trying to make the reader think you are intelligent.
---
Do one with a male dwarf hunter. Maybe T3 armor üòç

Didn't get the memo....?  Oops.
---
Shoes are bad for your feet anyway. You know what actually IS bad for you? The unfathomable amounts of soy consumption by allys
---
You can fight over good spawns too.
---
Did you start out really close to launch or after Dire Maul? No bash just curious. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Alleria swapped over but I started about a month after launch and it was still DM.
---
In fact they will be gaining customers this way, because they want retail players to stay subbed and play classic during downtime inbetween retail patches.
---
Im not sure there's anything more to it than that. The tank is also dependent on dps targeting the MT and not go off on some other mob you barely touched. This is my rotation and I'm not saying it's the best or anything but here it goes: pull mobs--&gt; bloodrage, if 3 mobs or more then thunderclap, 2 or less --&gt; sunder armor both mobs back and forth. Shield block and Revenge when possible. Again, there's a lot hanging on the dps focusing the right targets because it's easy to make a tank look like trash.
---
At least in the end of Vanilla and entirety of BC it was called VC in every server I was on. Dalaran, Anvilmar and Bloodhood all used VC instead of DM.
---
I think they'd rather have different kinds of content with different types of rewards instead of a single task that is far and above more efficient than other routes that becomes a daily chore.
---
Thanks! This is great. Here is link for full list:

That depends what you mean by "good" Hunter population
---
Beta seems pretty worthless to me since characters are deleted. Just a waste of time imo
---
I'm excited for that moment right before I suddenly realize it's 3:45am and I need to sleep.
---
I don't know what I'll be doing. Maybe I'll be grinding reps or professions. Maybe I'll be questing and leveling, or maybe I'll be casually pvping with guildies after a raid night. Could just be fishing out in one of my favorite zones with the ambient volume turned up. But whatever I'm doing, in that moment before my subconscious mind drifts to the clock, I'm totally lost in my adventure, however heroic or mundane, and this world is gone, and I'm not sitting at my computer anymore, I'm in Azeroth.
---
That's what I'm excited for.
---
Iirc LFG was zone based. The cities were linked at one point, and then 1.11 made it global.
---
It‚Äôs also clearly making a joke.
---
&gt;Do you believe hunters will be able to get r14
---
What sort of ridiculous uneducated question this is?
---
&gt;and sure spots at raids ?
---
What is "sure spot"?
---
Man I wish I had a group that liked playing games together that much. Seems like whenever my someone group does hardcore playing together people always get pissed off at eachother. Ruins the whole experience..
---
That goes both ways, though...
---
I don't really get the point of this, and hate the argument for the 15$. They have to pay their workers MUCH more than in 05 so it's only common sense, and 15$ is still cheap as fuck compared to 10$ in 05. 
---
Other than that, make sure you finish everything u want to do before playing every day. Work, come home, maybe workout, go out with friends, play with your kids, hang with your wife, and set a time frame to play. I did that years ago and my time doesn't feel wasted at all. I finish all my priorities, and the time I spend on WoW would be spent probably watching TV anyways.
---
I think your guys reaction is hilarious.

Hi, /u/tiddlytwotwo
---
You're so deep in that furry closet you're practically in Narnia, mate.
---
More so if people are in LFG chat or General looking for group. I would assume if you're in zone chat or shout in Westfall they'd know what you meant.
---
Female by a mile. Better gear proportions, no hunch or wonky run, better spell animations, better emotes...
---
You‚Äôre a salty person lol.
---
I‚Äôll do some experimenting come launch. If only respeccing wasn‚Äôt an arm and a leg.
---
So when I hate leveling the class I enjoy at endgame, reroll to play the class I love to level but hate endgame. Only to reach endgame and reroll back to "enjoy for 120-200 more hours" of the class I hated leveling but want to endgame with?  
---
Nvm, good suggestions to those that don't have this problem, I think I'm just being contrarian. glhf
---
Yeah u guys will really show him
---
It's not a bad a choice. Hunters have their uses in raids, do good damage, can easily pvp, and don't fight with all the clothies or rogues for gear. Honestly, hunter is class I tend to suggest to players who aren't sure what they want to do, but don't want to tank or heal.
---
Whats the synergy with locks?
---
Being able to play my class how I want instead of how blizzard wants the spec to be played.
---
&gt; Skinning will help you get your mount right at 40 instead of 41-43 which helps a ton with speed leveling.
---
But at 2 seconds per skin - are you saving more time than it takes to just level and get that much gold at 41?
---
Speedrunning at launch is about getting ahead of the pack.
---
Skinning = 5 minutes spent skinning every hour. So 6 hours in, level 15-18 or so, all the other speedrunners are 30 minutes ahead of you, and you're in the pack with the slower players who didn't take skinning.
---
Skinning is garbo for leveling fast.
---
Normally I'm all for #nochanges but this is something that has merit. Still, it's best to wait a few months before this decision becomes necessary. 
---
In the end Blizzard added this after a long time of absolutely refusing it. Even if it's a wet dream from a accounting viewpoint.
---
So implement more daily quests than any one person can feasibly do in a day. Yeah, I think Blizzard got that message.
---
This is what Blizzard does. Sends us shit equipment then wonders why things go wrong
---
Spells have a level modifier as well.  They are tagged with a MinLevel and MaxLevel, which for all spells other than level 1 spells, this gap is MinLevel+5 = MaxLevel.  The level modifier is multiplied by 0-5 depending on your level.
---
Other than that, I would disagree with the HPM only valuation, but that is another deal.  Nice looking site though, I like it.
---
What do you know. Someone posted the exact same thing I did, and it has silver and gold.
---
I guess not everyone is butthurt over is calling out the circle jerk
---
Yeah, play warrior.
---
VC... DM. Anyone calling it VC either didn't play Vanilla or has never played WoW
---
I don't think a multi-billion gaming company has the resources to fix bugs. It requires a lot of people and time, and when you fix something, something else breaks. I'm pretty sure they won't fix bugs because it's kind of pointless.
---
I wish they would set that up again instead of the 1.12 system.
---
the number is just based on your own personal order of joining. i.e. if you typed /join hunterchat it would
---
then be /5 next then /join world it would be /6. people just assume the numbers are the same for everyone because /1 general and /2 trade and /3 worlddefense are default.
---
I wanted it in Russian too, it bothered me right from the start. That said, the story is incredible and I‚Äôd recommend giving it a shot.
---
Good points.  I probably should have just left it at Solo PvP when I said they sucked, as I was limping duels, Solo queued BG‚Äôs, etc. all together in my own mind when I typed it out.

You should honestly be fine. Might run into some lag issues during high intensity things like large scale PvP or Raids, but everything else should be OK.

It was revealed 15 years ago.

Lol these $15 is too much posts are fanfuckingtastic, keep em coming boys!
---
If you wanna be picky about it, a survival hunter is far better, and so is an off tank warrior. But I‚Äôm not that elitist try hard to not being a Nightfall wielder just cause they are a shaman. The buff is so good it was used in TBC.
---
who said that classic wow reddit was their favorite ever?
---
I think I will suck it up and just watch it bc I love craig mazin and Barry Keoghan.
---
If you were like me and you eventually liked it, maybe I might be the same too.
---
Take it from me, I‚Äôve played since it released in 04 and have quit and came back several times.  Do I feel like I deserve a beta key? Fuck no, nor do I want one.  When it comes out in August it‚Äôll be basically a fresh game to me.  Just like it was all those years ago.  If you are so butt hurt you didn‚Äôt get a key, don‚Äôt know what to tell you except you can‚Äôt always get what you want, welcome to the world we live in...
---
What‚Äôs even funnier are the people who think they deserve beta keys more than other players simply because they played it at launch. I‚Äôve been sorting by new so I don‚Äôt really see much of the crybabies on this subreddit.
---
Must be a PvE server. Alliance and Horde not attacking each other in the bleachers. :p
---
Maybe people aren‚Äôt actively obsessed with refreshing reddit or google searching wow classic.
---
You will start with new characters but have 1 monthly sub
---
I would like to avoid comments like this that don't really talk about the topic as there must be others like me that have similar issues with a class they like. Thanks though..

I recommend you watch hakurai's 1-60 alliance leveling guide on YouTube, if you aren't worried about spoilers. Walks you through the whole 1 to 60 experience and explains the quests and mobs in a new friendly way.

---
It's very simple : before as a mage you were really trying to put as much distance as you could between you and the enemies.
---
Now as a warrior, it's the opposite !
---
Welcome to the warrior world, you will learn to hate mages :D
---
PS : don't be the warrior that doesn't tank. 
---
Go watch Preach on YouTube, he has at least 3 videos (the first one in RFC) where he teaches a lot of basic tanking, this guy is very good, he should make a tanking guide.
---
No one ever expects the warlock with Atiesh.
---
Not having to roll on tier sets is one of the bigger advantages. You always have more DKP than other classes you will be rolling against.  But if you like the tier sets, rogues have the best looking ones.
---
Get a job.
---
Even private servers usually keep goldselling/botting within reasonable limits. I do hope Blizzard will put efforts into investigating and banning both sellers and buyers.
---
I also know a popular botting program doesn't work on retail, so botting will again be more difficult.
---
The topic is, "I refused to play warrior in vanilla, and I'm going to make the same mistake in classic"
---
Don't play warrior then...
---
I could sit here and list a lot of things, typically I'd give some non descript answer like "everything" because WoW post Cataclysm has been absolute garbage. Most of what I'm looking forward to is the classes actually having abilities and playstyles I enjoy, they're so, so, so, so, BORING on live it beggars belief. Oh my god I don't know how anyone can find it enjoyable to play such a brain dead setup. I don't know WHO they're trying to appeal to but it's fucking awful. There were times in the past like MoP when I enjoyed playing some classes but ever since then it's been complete garbage. BFA is so incredibly shit to play.

This gave the information posted there slightly more credibility than stuff posted elsewhere, which we still see to this day with people trawling web-archives of it for information.
---
it also worked as a vocal pronunciation. I always thought of it as a whisper too, but also saying "PSSSTT" vocally, you know?
---
Not to mention this is TERRIBLE game design...
---
Maybe they quit wow and don‚Äôt see the giant ragnaros on the wow patch or they don‚Äôt actively refresh reddit 24/7 like us losers lmao
---
On Altar of Storms they definitely called it VC after Dire Maul came out, since most shouts in SW/IF/etc were talking about Dire Maul over Deadmines. I know it still caused confusion though because not everyone called it that.
---
Portal roulette is coming back, don't forget uc than org, than thunderbluff
---
/u/burohm1919 since you‚Äôre so pro-streamer, enjoy this world chat on your new server!
---
Why the fuck are u guys even spending time on Reddit if an extra 5$ a month from the old sub is bothering you that bad? Go fucking work an extra hour instead of posting here.
---
Or like I said, different types of content. Not just endless repeats of what we did while leveling.
---
Those are the same addons that everyone used back in Vanilla.
---
i have also never seen anyone say just DM, back in Vanilla. they always said DM East/West/North/Tribute.
---
Let me try to get the point across with an analogy.
---
What if hypothetically there was a daily quest that rewards a player with 100 gold by walking a 100 loops around ironforge. Do you think that would be a good addition to the game?
---
I can't for the life of me find the source, but a lot of people also remember that Blizzard said they want a relatively quick release of Phase 2. If we go by the 3-4 months of regular Vanilla content release progression, this would be probably 2 months.
---
I could see them maxing out at lvl 50.
---
isnt bleeding low priority debuff, that wont replace other debuffs?
---
Thank you for your help, Mr. Rogers.
---
Didn't bother finishing reading the abomination of a post, but I am not surprised. 
---
Kudos to you for trudging through that garbage.
---
Dailies were annoying if you needed to do them asap for rep grind for something needed for raids. They were angood source of quick gold to help with expenses. In vanilla you had to have rare profession patterns, RNG for rare BoE drop to sell on AH, grind crafting mats, or just grind mobs over and over to get gold. So while there weren't "dailies" u needed to do initially on log-in you'd still likely have to do some grinding to get gold to afford repair costs &amp; mats.
---
Did you have a stroke during this post?
---
you can always get the blue PvP gear and improve it with raid gear, there is plenty of dps gear for warriors in raids
---
Honestly on launch day.  Probably anywhere you can kill continuously that generates green exp value.  I'm aiming to get ahead of the pack and be lvl 20 when I end my first play session.  I'll skip quests if need be,  kill, kill, kill, kill.  Craft the OP wand asap and kill kill kill.
---
i still do this after every raid in retail
---
If they bring out TBC servers they won't erase Classic servers.
---
Right, but maybe some people found ways to make things work both ways or something i may be missing. Classic is 3 months away its just a discussion topic to see what others are thinking.
---
Unless you're trying to go for server first raid clears, I don't think there really is a left behind. There will always be people ahead of you and people behind you. As long as you're progressing and enjoying the journey, you're fine.
---
Already saw this in the elwynn forest chat on the stress test
---
Ah, so it‚Äôll be just like playing vanilla back on my desktop in ‚Äò05. Really will get the full nostalgia experience then haha. 
---
Thanks for the help all.
---
Hell yeah. That'd be easy as fuck to AHK while you walk your dog or shower.
---
looking to do alchemy/herb. to save gold and make gold is it difficult  to get the recipes  for flasks? are they very profitable?
---
Druids may be able to use fishing poles to gain large amounts of weapon skill.  Currently does in the beta but I think we're still waiting to see if Blizzard acknowledged this.
---
If anyone has information on this being addressed let me know!
---
&gt;Things like Monkas, Poggers, and Kappa are new "made up" words, and are spammed unceasingly in larger channels, which lowers the quality of chat immensely. So anyone who says those things outside of those large channels is, rightfully or not, associated with that kind of spammy obnoxious behavior that makes actual conversing impossible.
---
To you. Anyone else who knows what those things mean understands it perfectly fine.
---
&gt;Things like Monkas, Poggers, and Kappa are new "made up" words
---
All words are made up.
---
TL;DR: Who cares lmao
---
Your whole post history is whining about subscription fees and the Orc Racial. Get a fucking job and accept that some options are just superior to others in certain scenarios.
---
http://classicwow.live
---
TBC, with added vanilla extract: less gear drops, and crunched gear stats to minimize need for catch up mechanics. Fragments of azzinoth drop throughout the black Temple and can be combined to create Warglaives (or dagger shards)
---
Hehe, fair pick :) u2
---
Thank you, it was rough.
---
Its clear this person has never led a raiding guild.  These ideas are a cluster of frustration.
---
If you're expecting Classic without Daily quests to have any less repeated grinding than the other expansions with Daily quests, you're in for a very rude awakening.
---
Bottom ocean off Westfall was always hit in the vanilla days.
---
While pserver rates are different it was still absolutely crushed in the 1st lockout. You‚Äôd be amazed what 40 people who know what they‚Äôre doing can do in vanilla.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I am talking about the retail community and general online games, earlier days people took time to do these events and people were there who were ready to take up the charge.
---
Really? Didnt had that notion.. MC was easy back then. Infeel that the lack of information and hardware were the first boss lol
---
You literally said they quit recently
---
It do be like that
---
There are enough resources available to anyone willing to look for them. There is no need to resurrect a resource from 10+ years ago.
---
True story
---
Speaking in memes and emotes does not make you an idiot.  I sometimes catch myself saying Pog, cmonBruh or Kkona in my daily life.  It's just like when you use professional work jargon around others and you have to switch back to basic english .  On that  note tho the people who will spam it in World chat are most likely idiots.
---
What holy spec? You would be great in group pvp! But yeah 1v1 I don‚Äôt think you would have a lot of success other than just not dying
---
Community run world chat will help.
---
Looking back I spent 300+ plus days played into wow, and though I could have used that time differently I didn't, and I'm happy about that because I enjoyed every second of it like I would any other hobby and can't wait to go back with my buds. Why do people look at that with regret, like what is wrong with you lmao
---
Its kinda against the rules of mmorpg
---
I feel that druids are going to be a thing in wpvp and thinking of rolling one tbh. But man..shammy has that sexy appeal in vanilla with unstoppable force into wf lol
---
I mean you literally just said "a guild mate would buy 1000G for 20$". So, what's going to be different besides the price per gold? Still gold selling.
---
This is what makes me so excited. I just started playing in BFA and realized it wasn‚Äôt really the game for me in terms of community and immersion. 
---
That being said, the announcement of classic wow has been consuming my time. Everything is about August 27th and this release for me. Im hoping to meet a good group of people and get lost in the world like everyone once did 15 years ago. 
---
August can‚Äôt come soon enough!
---
Those shoulder pads are awesome indeed!
---
I think that you start seeing Oily Blackmouth in Darkshore/Westfall, and I got the most Stonescale in Azshara when going around fishing the whirlpools there.
---
Savory Deviate Delight might also sell well, if you want to go to the Barrens. They're just for fun though, so I'm not sure how much demand there is.
---
First people to hit 60 will do so in the first week. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a sub-4d /played, but I‚Äôm expecting the people at the top will hit 60 in 4d and a few hours. Joana‚Äôs record is going to be broken without a doubt.
---
Play warrior. If that's what you want to do, do it. If you want to PVP and tank in raids, go ahead. If anything, you'll be a lot tankier with tank gear
---
Are you 12?
---
True. Seems like the best fit for armors
---
That hand tho
---
Horrific
---
Yup! You?
---
&gt;They keep clamoring for changes
---
It's like you never visited the Vanilla forums back in the day, everybody was bitching about something.
---
If you had told them 15 years later #nochange would be a thing they would have told you to go troll somewhere else ! :D
---
In fact there are 2 MMO states : 
---
1) everybody is bitching : the game is alive
---
2) nobody is bitching : the game is dead
---
True that. Fits more on the "rogue stereotype" right?
---
Are you really this dumb? The last boss‚Äô name is van cleef. There is also another dungeon in the game called dire maul. If you really can‚Äôt understand why people call it that there‚Äôs not much hope for you.
---
Ill be honest, always hated his music choices lol
---
Pog
---
I don't think information addons can be accused if that. If an add on gives information you don't normally have access to, that is a good add on. Can't say much for the rest though.
---
what makes you think it will be much harder in classic?
---
A holy paladin can kill pretty much any warrior 1v1 unless there is a large gear gap.  You should also stalemate most rogues 1v1 as well.  
---
Other than getting dunked on by mages/locks/priests, HPaladin is pretty strong 'solo pvp'.
---
But like, way more retarded. Way way more retarded.
---
It says no stack limit wtf. Just fill it with priests and locks lol.
---
I can see the animations on wowhead dressing room right?
---
You can do the quest there. It‚Äòs only a problem if a class isn‚Äòt available in the zone. Btw if you run that way you don‚Äòt have to do the wetland run. You can go west outside of Ironforge and go up a ramp on top of the mountains and jump to death/to Menethil.
---
There isn't a both ways though, you either play warrior or dont...  you literally lived through the experience you are talking about.
---
Do you have the time and dedication to level a Warrior to 60, get the required preraid gear, farm for consumables and the necessary respecs in the case you want to PvP in the optimal spec (which is Arms, not Fury)?
---
Phase 1 is day 1, phases 2 and 3 they said they will try and roll out quickly. Phase 4, 5 and 6 they said will be based on player progression. When they feel enough players have progressed through the content, they will release the next phase.
---
&gt; Gone were the days when stumbling into a zone above your pay grade would end in certain death,
---
I miss this and I look forward to it in classic
---
I think it will replace, but I guess it depends on how classic will handle it
---
It's called DM in europe.
---
It was Ion who said phase 2 and 3 would be quick, the rest would be based on the player progression
---
Keep me updated closer to release, I won't be raiding but would love to hang out and chat with yall.
---
I don't hate streamers but I'm worried about their impact and hopefully there will be enough servers available to avoid them. Ideally they would all play on just a handful in order to interact with each other, at least the larger ones. Idrc if a person with 40 viewers is in my WSG match but I certainly won't play if fans are going to harass me for running the flag w/o a streamers blessing or some other minor faux pas.
---
It was always VC when I played.  It really depends on what's most popular on a server, then using that naming convention.
---
So (OP) you‚Äôre suggesting that by bundling Classic and Retail for the same price as Retail alone, Blizzard would lose more customers than if they asked the Retail players to pay another $5-10 a month to have access to Classic? Umm...
---
Seems to me Blizzard is hoping that after you have played Classic for a while, and made some friends from Retail (assuming you aren‚Äôt a current subscriber), you might give BFA a try. Do you think some people might (rhetorical)?
---
You want too much - raiding in two roles, PvPing, not having to respec, and even tier or no tier is important for you...
---
I suggest you to go druid and try to find a guild that takes you as a non-tryhard feral. You can then do all what you want, and tier/no tier will be the only issue.
---
Or follow your dream and roll warrior. Find a casual guild that allows you to raid as arms/offtank (would perhaps be even more difficult than with feral, but nothing is impossible) - this is a spec you can also PvP with.
---
I think lvl 49 cap makes a lot of sense from blizz perspective. I can't see them letting it get past lvl 54.
---
Vanilla is full of similarly clunky mechanics. If that‚Äôs the main problem with the class, you should stick to it, or just avoid Classic because it won‚Äôt get easier with other classes.
---
&gt;  To you. Anyone else who knows what those things mean understands it perfectly fine.
---
I'm not talking about their meanings, it's about how they are used that is the primary problem, that is endless spamming. 
---
&gt; All words are made up.
---
Yes, which is why I put "made up" in quotes. I don't take issue with them being made up because all language is. But that alone does make it different than something like rofl/lol/lmao/wtf which are acronyms. Generational elements aside, that coupled with the insane spam pretty much guarantees it's going to be viewed negatively.
---
Fury 2h is fine, for pvp not so much, you can get 50g in 1hr if you look up a guide, respecting won‚Äôt be that bad honestly to go arms for pvp reasons
---
I think locks are a blast. They have multiple fears/CC. You can use your void to tank mobs and sit back and chip away ending the fight with full mana and health or unload with shadow bolts if you are feeling ballsy! They provide great utility with curses and summons. They get a free mount at 40 and a sweet unique mount at 60. I mean I really don‚Äôt see many downsides especially if you are wanting to solo play a lot.
---
Engineering is worse , far more time consumin mining too once youre around 100-125 skill. For lvling weapons i can say get the two hander from Senjin village then get the one from warrior quest and youre good for a while. After 15 you kinda have a problem and i solved it via buying a weapon on AH . 20 - 26 ish you should be good if you get one hander from WC quest and the mace from the dungeon itself which i have been lucky to get . Lasted me till i got corpsemaker and then i worked asap on whirlwind axe and that one can carry you easily up to 45-50. Most problems i had was from around 14-19 when it comeas to weapons.
---
Level up 2 warriors is the way folks solved it in vanilla
---
You can always bubble the sheep, or trinket the sheep if you save bubble for Counterspell shielding.
---
Ya the spawn rate is insane. If there aren't a bunch of other players there it's near impossible to do those quests at level. It seems like they put in double the mobs as well.
---
When an immovable object meets an unstoppable Force!
---
&gt;Apart from the levling side thats going to be much more hard than pserver duo to more ppl playing
---
thats just wrong dude
---
What makes you think that it will be harder than a pserver?
---
The server has layering which should make it even easier when you get ahead, since pservers dynamic respawn is dynamic, meaning if there's few in your area it's blizzlike spawns, with layering if there's 10 in your area then you can split into 10 different layers and be alone.  
---
Hardest part about classic is that all the nolife players are somewhat more spread out since there's so many servers, where on pserver you could combine the full nolife NA + full nolife EU to make power guilds.
---
A geared prot warrior is an absolute beast with a healer behind them
---
Just stack shadow resist.
---
Seriously üòÇ
---
How? Servers going to have the double pserver population
---
Totally agree.  Quality of life improvements such as large rewards for daily quests, lfg system, can suck the fun out of the game while lowering 'friction'.
---
You are not suddenly getting BfA if you make enh shaman viable as a dps in pve content, which it was before 1.9 patch. Why not roll the game back to 1.9 patch instead of 1.12 so we have viable shamans and useless fury since apparently class balance is BfA? Why not back to release version with no vanilla balance at all?
---
The eyes it brought are mostly children.  It's not impossible for them to play classic when it comes out but it's unlikely.  It has a sub.  
---
For every kid who convinces his mother to hand over the credit card, there are 100 more who don't.  Games like Fortnite are full of little kids because they are free. The vast, vast majority of players never spend a dime.
---
These people aren't subbing to WoW.
---
I dont understand why people would call it VC, the entire dungeon is called Dead Mines, you wouldn't name a dungeon after the last boss.
---
In europe its called DM, as far as I'm aware its always been the case, even on horde side.
---
DM for deadmines
---
DM:E
---
DM:S
---
DM:N
---
for diremaul stuff, nobody did the entirety of diremaul in one go, you went to one of them so calling dire maul just DM was redudant, am I missing something here?
---
It stacks up to 5 times idk why that value is so off
---
Hmm didnt account layer tbh
---
He did one of them.
---
What does vc even mean? You talk about dead mines... Why vc?
---
recents pservers had 10+ k on launch
---
you're god damn right I do.
---
the lvling meta is dungeon running, u dont have to worry about mobs and ganks u just have to worry about getting 4 more people for long grind sessions
---
and pretty sure most pservers either do real progression or buff raids to make them not totally faceroll
---
&gt;levling side thats going to be much more hard than pserver duo to more ppl playing...meaning less mobs and more ganks
---
If you nolife, you are ahead of everyone and have little to no mob competition. wPvP won't be an issue because the other faction as well consists of nolifers who won't waste time on it (and there're not that many of them).
---
So one week of nolifing to get to 60, couple of days to get close to preraid BiS - and preraid-geared raid smashes MC.
---
ironically shadow priests and warlocks weren't the best in vanilla. shadow priests were good but not the best.   
---
you don't have much to worry about since you're not aware
---
So? Why does it matter who is playing any character. I didn't log in during my vanilla days to be a nerdy kid in middle School. I logged in to be a Tauren Hunter. 
---
Let people have and make memories without trying to ruin it.
---
Jeez.
---
Forgot screenshots from 2006
---
If they progress classic into Tbc I will stop playing. If they add new content to vanilla I'm so down. But either way it's a long term problem, the current content plan will keep people occupied for at least 2 years
---
You still get to use your tier gear when tanking, which you will be doing a fair of as a warrior, at least if you want to. And tier2.5 is super cool in PVP, and the shoulders that looks really nice rock in pve. 
---
As for respeccing a lot, you shouldn't have to respec more than twice a week, and if your guild is smart and a bit flexable, you can clear raids day before and day after resets and then respec to pvp for 13 days. 
---
Making gold isn't all that bad as a fury warrior btw, if you have mining and you find a enchanting healer(esp if paladin or shaman) you can make lots of money in DME.
---
Hi so down. but either way it's a long term problem, the current content plan will keep people occupied for at least 2 years, I'm dad.
---
That one was highly requested, so here you go!
---
I still want to do:
---
Dreadnaught's Battlegear(Warrior T3)
---
Bloodfang Armor(Rogue T2(seems like u/Stadics2 already done it better:)))
---
Battlegear of Wrath(Warrior T2)
---
The Earthshatterer(Shaman T3)
---
Not sure about sets with visible face parts, still can be done in near future
---
Thanks for all the love, that was given to previous post!
---
I do cause they are a push recently in the meta. A meta that runs around 5% parry and broken glancing blow mechanics that allow 100% damage with white hits.
---
You can‚Äôt completely negate the glancing blow damage reduction so ultimately you won‚Äôt be getting the tps increase of the pserver meta that makes the damage spiking worth it.
---
It comes from the PoGChamp emote, which means *'Play of the Game' Champion*, and the face is a :o style face.  
---
It is so fucking stupid, its like saying "El Oh El" but one layer more retarded, because what the fuck is a "Play of the Game" in most context...
---
&gt;u/Stadics2
---
Awersome!
---
It‚Äôs how it was back then. Balancing classes changes a lot. They won‚Äôt do something that big that would piss plenty of people off. It‚Äôs easier for them to just say this what you asked for so here it is and be done with it.
---
God you‚Äôre a massive cock
---
Lmao..is there even that no lifers playing in pservers? Jesus christ. Didnt had the notion of it
---
Sometimes people that learn English as a second language write like this for some reason. They have a brain for all these ridiculous words but struggle with basic coherence.
---
Here honey, drink this.  Daddy has to hit level 5 by tonight, no excuses.
---
Same here. I will add the launch day, because I started Vanilla 5 months in.
---
I won't clear Naxx, not enough time to invest, but I will be more than happy with everything else.
---
I remember a few shamans that went 2h with resto talents.  
---
Somewhere in the line of 11/11/30+, with 2h mace/axe and nature swiftness.
---
Seemed great fun for pvp and still allot of heal talents.
---
So do *you* have a link to the source? :-D
---
I played Horde for the beginning of classic and don‚Äôt remember too much about VC/DM, since I mainly was doing RFC and WC when low level. 
---
When I was ally it was after WSG opening up, before AQ, which was after DM opened.  But it was definitely VC then. And it was VC for the remainder of vanilla.
---
Theres no such thing for Shamans, ontop of that if I stack shadow resist they can just use fire. My friend also told me about them being able to take away 75 resistance to shadow or fire.. which sounds absolutely broken.
---
Betas are just for people to fuck around in, not for testing anything.
---
IIRC you couldn‚Äôt group queue AV like you could WSG or AB. You could only solo queue. When they added cross-realm BGs, it allowed folks in a raid group to all queue individually at the battle master at the same time, and they‚Äôd have a high chance of being grouped together. But if there are only 1-2 AVs on the server, the group starts are less likely to work.
---
Recent xpac*
---
I would not be surprised if that were true, but where did you get that number?
---
Melee hunter!
---
They aren't really that profitable since black lotus is bind on equip in 1.12 itemization, so anyone can pick a lotus and send it to a guildie that has the recipe. If you go for it, don't expect to make much money as alch, but you can help your guild out though.
---
Pvp finder?! Ahhh you mean Kevin! Just pm him for an invite. Every guild has a Kevin.
---
no, they'll have less. last number I read was 3500 ish
---
Because its a totally unique experience. There is an entirely different meta to explore with incremental level caps that is unlike any other experience ever had in WoW. We only get to experience that new adventure vicariously through streamers. I dont have time for it anyway, but people who do are understandably frustrated by the barriers.
---
There 100% will be.
---
Well you might be able to get some DPS gear for offspec, once the casters have everything they want. Respec costs will be a bitch though, I was in a similar situation with my Shaman on a pserver a few years ago, and I ended up getting tired of being broke all the time.
---
Talents. Meaningful, incremental progression. Important professions. Consistent community and reputation building within it. The removal of flying mounts.  The world feeling huge and dangerous again. NOT feeling like the biggest bad-ass in the world simply for buying the game and showing up. Making lasting friendships in the world.
---
This started out as a super fun nostalgia subreddit and quickly turned into a fucking cesspool. A lot of people here are   30+ years old and the definition of man child. 
---
The game will come out and you can play it. Streamers arent going to ruin anything. Chill the fuck out.
---
52 armor is beastly
---
That's really off topic. But no, I don't expect Classic to have less overall grinding. But without specific daily-incentivized content, I'll feel more free to select from a variety of content I might want to do to progress my character. Sure there will always be "optimal" routes to progress. But daily-reward centered content that outweighs all other options turns it into a chore. It's the game telling you "This is what you should do today," rather than you deciding organically what you want to do.
---
Maybe, maybe not. One thing is clear to me, they definitely have a huge advantage in PvP situations to the point it doesnt seem fair, we all thought rogues were the best ganking class but I've seen multiple warlocks counter them as soon as they sap
---
which is why its extra stupid in wow
---
It's actually way better
---
I believe this guy has made a few videos about these topics, and he definitely knwos what he's talking about:
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwdUQvn5wiWEcjHE77k4Dnw
---
The salt is hilarious. I just don‚Äôt get it
---
The droprate from flask recipes is 3% and there bosses that drop it can be found in Scholo, Strat and U or LBRS. But be aware that these recipes are worth quite some gold since they are not BoP, so be sure to reserve them when you do these runs.
---
And yes, they are VERY profitable when you grind the maths yourself since they need a butload of maths.
---
Elemental is completely useless as dps in raids, it really honestly is. We're not talking 100 less dps than casters, we are talking several hundred.
---
I'm so torn between going ud and orc.
---
That's fair. I do think the incremental level caps does sound interesting. I was watching a couple streamers and thought the level 30 cap was really neat.
---
But I also feel like these are the people that prefer to min-max instead of just enjoying the game.
---
This is an autistic answer to someone simply asking questions.
---
I just don‚Äôt see that working logically.
---
Feral weapon skill =\= fishing skill. We‚Äôll see if blizzard digs into it. Though even if it‚Äôs the same I can‚Äôt imagine it won‚Äôt get changed cause it‚Äôs definitely not intended.
---
Hyped for warrior
---
I'd rather have a daily end-game dungeon quest than absolutely zero reason to ever enter a dungeon once you have enough raid gear.
---
Theres Irony like kek, and theres pog...
---
Spriest will kick one persons shit in and then they are oom. Thats their weakness
---
Isn't blizzard a lot better at banning gold sellers and hackers these days?
---
I'm sure it would, but if it becomes a problem then it would be wise to touch up on some of the numbers of their spells and talents
---
[It's pretty fucking crazy.](https://preview.redd.it/rdu8j0tvucv11.png?width=622&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d8d25867acbc9f853a262668a65e6df64c0cc5)
---
Back in the early days it was relatively nice around here. Though I guess you could say that about most places on the internet...
---
I remember the sheer terror when teenage me didnt know this and I accidently deleted mine on my 60 Warrior
---
Belkin n52te. Loved that thing (guessing the Gen 2 of that). Just recently had to throw it away. Was in my old room at my parents house but was all janky after all the years. Would totally buy a new one but switched over to using an MMO mouse (utechsnart one off Amazon) and does the trick for me.
---
They might actually be able to charge for that too, maybe not as a full price expansion, but it would alleviate some of Blizz's overhead and make them more open to remastered-like content. 
---
They couldn't charge for TBC classic in just the same way they didn't/couldn't charge for Vanilla Classic: we already bought the game.
---
I don't think anyone has a preraid pvp list, could be interesting to make. But yes you want separate items. You want stamina on basically all your pieces, the highest armor quality (plate,mail,leather) you can wear, and if you are a healer you don't want nearly as much spirit/mp5, and as a caster you want int instead of spellpower(in pve you almost ignore int). Some items are so powerful and optimal that you want them for both pve and pvp, but some great pve items are really shit in pvp.
---
That makes no sense cause we are talking about /played not realtime so it doesnt matter if you play 1hour a day or 10 if you just wanna get a good /played.
---
At least your death will be swifter than a Paladin‚Äôs.
---
Will they fix bugs? Yes they will. Will they change numbers cause people think it‚Äôs OP? No. 
---
It‚Äôs how it was then and that‚Äôs how it is now. People wanted classic so we got classic.
---
Do weapon enchantments from enchanters (eg. Crusader) and temp. Enchantments such as whetstone or wind fury stack?
---
Yes but its a picture. LMAO LMAO is just text.
---
:(
---
Pretty much sums it up perfectly.
---
I do find it a bit ironic that some of the people clamoring for Classic Wow are the same people who pushed the current Wow to the state it is in now. Instant gratification above all else.
---
Honestly, its in flavour for a Warlock
---
IIRC his family died while he was defending the high elves, and when humans needed assistance the elves abandoned them. Therefore the cost to keep elves allied with humans cost him everything, with no return.
---
It's a SRGRAFO comic, he's very famous on reddit for making these strips about current affairs and reddit meta stuff. I have no idea if this is a reposted original or the text was edited though, probably the latter because I think the artist would have posted this himself.
---
His other comics have been edited before for other subs and events. His simple style makes it very memeable.
---
general chats are going to be absolute chaos for the first few weeks
---
I can't wait
---
Being oom is normal though üòÇ or Sproest will be oom 40 seconds into a duel against a warlock, they eat your mana away without you even casting more than 7 spells/abilities
---
Good looking helmets are hard to come by, but soms other pieces or weapons really look good on trolls!
---
It's especially ridiculous considering it's the same price as back in the day, and they've never changed the price for inflation.
---
Runescape membership used to be $5, now it's $11.
---
No one except the MT needs gear, casters could be naked for rag. Nolife guilds ill absolutely have him down in first lockout
---
Maybe if you don't read it in a negative tone then it doesn't come across that way. When I read it it genuinely sounds like they're just talking about their love for this aspect of gameplay. Weird, maybe I'm wrong, I guess I'll just go back to lurking.
---
Van Cleef I think, the last boss of that dungeon if I remember. I might be wrong.
---
Are you using grounding and tremor totem? Because those are really good. You can use leather and cloth shadow resist gear too, it's not like spriests and locks are doing amazing autos against you. You also have purge and a 6 sec cd interrupt.
---
Van Cleef because DM is used for Dire Maul
---
Holy fuck this is gold. Literally two farmers charging in and cleaning up the farms from those filthy cows. I love the broom smacking on those totems, lol.
---
Sorry if im asking something too obvious for you. I dont know the game.
---
Emoticons are just natural extensions of body language, twitch emotes are the extreme though hah.
---
Sometimes we have to make mistakes in order to learn. There's still a bunch of quality of life changes that didn't adversely affect the way the game plays like putting 12 items in a mailbox, but who is to decide? General consensus is go back to vanilla since it was the base.
---
From my experience the axes really aren't that expensive, you should definitely consider them. I think there's an offhand from scholo that's a decent replacement to flurry, and deepwounds is pretty common.
---
Well looks like the only option is to join warlock, or waste my life getting potions and scrolls to stand even a slight chance
---
I got you this time fam
---
https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=572
---
If you go to that house in game, the game says you're in Goldshire.
---
My ignore list is going to hit cap so quickly.
---
Right, I'm not here saying VC is "right" or DM is "wrong" just that both are valid acronyms that occurred on different servers during vanilla. No one in 2005 was thinking about which acronyms were the most logical or optimal... They just came up with something, people repeated it and more likely than not it stuck.
---
Everyone retroactively trying to assign the logic of "well it was this because of Dire Maul" etc. Is just trying to provide a logical backing to an argument that really boils down to kids and young adults picking an acronym for the quest/dungeon that they were looking for and seeing what stuck.
---
Further, I can farm gold in retail to purchase a game token to use and fund my own adventures in both games.
---
Best part is this doesn't affect the Classic economy at all.
---
I'm okay with the dailies that mostly give cosmetic stuff. The Netherdrake Dailies for an example. You were grinding those to get a cool mount. Those people can take or leave. I don't mind a few zones at level cap that are set up for dailies for 60s to do with a few choice items, but you can't overload the player with them.  
---
What killed it for me was MoP where you had to do dailies to gain enough rep to unlock access to a new reputation for *more* dailies.
---
spavhetti
---
The only requirement for R14 is having absolutely 0 life outside of wow
---
What is VC?
---
Name another dungeon in the entire game that's abbreviated after a boss, r tard.
---
Yep, even that isnt enough sadly. I've been able to grasp Shaman for the most part, but theres no counter to a warlock with the right talents, they can be trash at their class and still win
---
"Guys, if they tweak the numbers and make the spec viable to be used at any point in the game, it means we're suddenly playing BFA."
---
That health and mana bars look so terrible my eyes are bleeding ;/
---
Some private servers had 15k players at launch. Classic will be capped at 2.5-3k.
---
Explaine how if you dont mind. But dont separate pve and pvp pls :) coz what i remember it was better old. Maybe i lost feeling :))))
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying the meta-game.  
---
Tbh, this is a great way for blizzard to keep classic alive for a long while going forward.  Have incremental level cap servers.
---
Yes, they‚Äôre completely done different things.
---
Drink myself back into a coma.
---
Yes there are competitive people on all games.
---
My friend group who played 15 years ago are all taking a week off... myself included.
---
That will likely lead to about 4 days played and a constant party available for dungeons. We will likely be 50+ by the.
---
If there is an onyxia pug or MC pug we will go by the second lockout.
---
I really don't get it at all man. I really had to try and get into Twitch, as being a bit older I wanted to stay current with how content is consumed. I love the platform, but I really don't get people that do all that spammy chat shit.
---
Pop a mana pot when they oom and try to burst
---
This rings so true is scary, lol
---
Sorry, can someone explain whats with the deal with the streamers hate?
---
Have I drunkenly created a new account and I posted this yesterday? This is spot on!
---
Don't worry, we gave him shit constantly over it.
---
A low rank one is fine for when you need a quick burst. It‚Äôs a bit of a mana hog so I don‚Äôt use it much.
---
On EU Dunemaul we called it VC.
---
Were you the same person who made Booty Bay in TS?
---
I can never get them oom, only class that got my friend to go oom was a resto druid
---
[I don't need it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA1mbZ_MMh8)
---
Shortly after 1.3 was released is when I remember seeing DM stop being Dead mines...things change with patches. Some people just don't like change.
---
You don't need to run through Wetlands. You can climb the mountains in northwest Dun Morogh and hop over into the sea. Then you can either swim all the way to Menethil, or you can drown yourself and rez at the spirit healer to get there instantly.
---
I'm planning on rolling a Dwarf Hunter at launch, and after I complete all of Dun Morogh I'm gonna head to Darkshore and quest pretty much exclusively on Kalimdor until 60.
---
Ok, that's great to know, at least now I know I have more options to think about before classic starts
---
Thing is, most guilds only had 20 good players (if that) anyhow. If you have 40 good people who know what they are doing and are committed to a cause. I have no doubts Rag will die before the 14 day mark. There are several guilds attempting to do it before the 7 day mark, including leveling.
---
Rank 14 is insane. If you're still learning the game you won't achieve it. Not trying to be a jerk, just being realistic.
---
Ogrila daily quests were the very first dailys right? Hated them with a passion. TBC really introduced more shit then just flying...
---
Yeah mages need to cast some meat food and stop backing these stupid bread and cookies.
---
I love flying mounts and would not play BC if they remove them. I don't understand why people keep bringing this up, how was flying a problem?
---
c",)
---
Dueling a spriest is probably one of the hardest 1v1s in the game. They need to play retarded to lose. Just how it is
---
Darnassus2020
---
Total amount of players is going to be much higher than on pservers, but on pservers everyone is playing on the same realm
---
What's with the hard secret question? If you were be queried about it, you'd have to write everything exactly like that?
---
Since Blizzard finally after years has made me want to give them my money again, a CE would be awesome for them and for me.
---
Yeah by the time I was playing, Dire Maul had been out shortly. Alleria US Alliance as well, and all my time playing it was called VC.
---
Its itemized ok for hunter/rogue and to some extent warrior.
---
You'd think with all the spells warlocks get they would require skill, but if you put dots up and just cast with void Walker out you basically win üòÇ
---
Soul link warlocks and shadow priests are great in 1v1s and 1vX situations and that's about it. Hard to consider them overpowered when they are weak and unwanted in group PvP.
---
it's all black and white for you purist fanatics. wow vanilla was balanced as well you are aware of this right? warlocks used to be crap but they were buffed. ret&amp;prot are crap, and they could be balanced because protection is literally useless. How does finding a different game solve these issues?
---
AV was more a pvp playground. Battle of attrition, funneling enemy into choke points and constant mass pvp. If you wanted to farm honor WSG &amp; AB was your choice.
---
You will have exactly zero CC except for the instant cast hammer which is a 3s stun on a 30 second (15s f you invest talents) timer.
---
I'd look up Wowhead Classic and Classic.db. They've been great so far for me although Wowhead is a bit bloated.
---
Adding to this, it's also possibly the *only* opportunity to meet and play with a lot of people I've seen on Twitch, for example. I'd rather waste a few days in vain inside the Beta than on pservers, but the temptation is just too much for now.
---
Let's hope they invite more people!
---
It was VC to a lot of people everywhere, anybody who says it was only DM is delusional.
---
They have counters, so definitely not over powered.  Not to mention they're pretty shit in organized PvP, especially Shadow Priest.
---
Thats vanilla for ya
---
Get better and stop whining, nothing in life is ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù.
---
Also as a Shaman you are pretty much the counter to Priests.
---
You can wand that shit down and iirc only water elementals you face pre 40 are the stv ones
---
The opposite of being "off" cooldown is being "on" cooldown FYI.
---
I like when there's a reason to run all types of content. I'd just rather have the rewards organically inserted into the game instead of something telling me what I should do on a given day.
---
Some people like that more structured reward system though, and that's totally valid.
---
Play prot, raid two nights a week back to back, after raid nights are over respec for pvp, play 5 days of pvp then respec for raids.
---
Get your retail cry baby ass off this subreddit and never post again!
---
I thought there was. Maybe it went in on TBC or wrath. That's when I stopped.
---
As a Tank and DPS warrior who leans towards DPS, I'll go UBRS any day of the week.
---
World firsts were achieved many, many years ago. The hype for that is long gone.
---
Even then, comparing %ages dmg increase is not a good way to compare the value. The value in kick is in the interrupt, which you get in rank 1, not the negligible damage. But go ahead and spend 5-6g on your kick while I have an easier time saving for my mount.
---
I noticed that too üòÇ
---
Fishing/Cooking/First Aid: Always yes. These professions are easy, can be leveled a little bit at a time fairly easily, provide some nice benefits, and can earn some gold.
---
Gathering professions are pure money (or supplies to level a crafting profession).
---
Crafting professions can make some money, especially if you're maxed out and have some good recipes.
---
For levelling, I've found that you can usually fill in holes with some decent greens. There are also some blues that you'll probably want but will have to either spend some gold at the AH or hours trying to get them to drop. As an example, the Spider Silk Boots from Tailoring are really nice, but the two Iridescent Pearls are not easy to get when you're in your 20s.
---
Enchanting is in between. You can either use it as a gathering profession (de then ah the mats) it you can level it up and try to sell enchants. Again, you'll make the most money if you have the best and rarest enchants. A nice benefit to enchanting, though, is that you can always have semi-decent enchants for your level on your gear without needing to try to get somebody else to enchanting your gear every time you upgrade.
---
I'm not completely decided yet, but I think I'm going to main Tailoring/Skinning while I'm levelling. I'll try to trade linen/wool/silk for bags, and ship leather off to an alt.
---
The lvl 5 alt will have enchanting/leatherworking, and will mostly be used for disenchanting, crafting wands, and selling things on the ah. The leatherworking is to convert raw leather into enchanting mats.
---
That'll probably get me through to level 60, at which point I'll probably drop skinning for alchemy or engineering.
---
I'm almost positive he's correct.
---
Like i said i know the classes. Nothing feels even close to as clunky as druid. Sure all are a bit clunky compared to modern wow but none need 3 button presses to use a potion or a defensive cooldown
---
It seems like once you hit 30 and get Whirlwind axe, it gets a lot better. I imagine sweeping strikes helps a ton as well
---
I mean, I wasn't triggered personally. I was just using you as a prompt for a little joke.
---
This reads like a drug addled minds CV.
---
It is, op edited it
---
I dunno...I‚Äôve been enjoying the vanilla screenshots. Level 60 ding in Stormwind was dope.
---
I have the time, i don't remember what respecs cost. I also would play fury over arms in pvp, not to concerned with playing whats best because its "the best" i just play the specs i enjoy in pvp.
---
Lol a guild leader opposed to a streamer with literally thousands of viewers is hardly comparable. He'll get a ban if he keeps stirring shit up. But go on and Stan for some streamer if you feel like. Im sure he appreciates you as a friend
---
You are better off going Druid than trying to make Enhancement Shaman work.
---
/Ihaveverysmollpp
---
Hell half the time it's free.
---
It's the same exclusivity tactic GMail pulled with their invites back in the day. It makes people want it more, as it's evident by the QQ.
---
First of all, you can get a raid spot as an enhance shaman wielding nightfall if you are able to totem twist. There is only room for one per raid though.
---
Alternatively 2h Fury on horde is higher DPS than DW fury until you are clearing BWL. OEB is insanely good and once you fork out the cast for edgemasters the damage is crazy. The biggest issue with 2h Fury on horde is your threat capped most of the time so you'll need a shaman twisting TA totem which is kinda lame to rely on.
---
I only want to raid as one role, i would prefer to raid as tank and pvp as fury. My memory at the moment is that this is a hard thing to do in classic.
---
What a stupid and pointless thread.
---
Do you want people to agree with you? Fine, I agree, Spriests and locks are OP in Vanilla duels.
---
Feel better now?
---
Now what?
---
I'm tired of you
---
Not entirely sure I understand your level modifier, I am using one calculated as ([Level required for next rank - 1] + 5) / [Character level] . 
---
Regarding HPM as the only decider of rank is not optimal, but that‚Äôs where I started. I will keep working on it in order to make it better, and show more.
---
Thanks, for the feedback :)
---
Questing addons already work on the beta.
---
Unfortunately there won't be dual spec so you'll have to keep respeccing
---
I thought in that github thread they say that the formula private servers are using for glancing blow reduction is correct..?
---
Sorry but this is a bit wrong... In MC certainly, and parts of BWL, hunters actually do more damage than mages and rank about 3 or fourth in total class dps charts
---
THIS IS GLORIOUS
---
Gotta beat boggs
---
rogues hard counter locks though, not sure what you are talking about
---
If you follow a guide for the first time you can easily get to 60 in 9-10 days played. The more you do it, the faster you go. The first 60 I got took me 10, the next 9, then it's at 8. Aiming for 7 once classic comes out, possibly faster since I'm rolling hunter.
---
One of the best looking sets. I used to rock those shoulders too. Warlock is IMO the only class that didn't have a single shitty looking tier set (at least during vanilla/tbc/wotlk that I played).
---
What makes you say that?
---
Molten core was the first vanilla set of raids being played on the last balance patch of the game.  It will be a joke for people who know the raid.  It was a joke in 2006 too.
---
There will be a bunch of people under 7 days /played. Probably a bunch at 5 1/2 - 6 days as well.
---
It really helps to mark targets for the dps to focus, kill next, cc, etc. I mapped out my marks to the numpad, but there are addons too.
---
Favorite joke. 
---
Yes, I fell for it.
---
BFA has an identity problem.
---
It took me months to realize that kappa was a twitch thing and had nothing to do with Japanese water monsters.
---
wont be much competition for hunters early on as several are needed for kiting adds on the domo fight alone. Where hunters get weeded out is more post bwl content as their gear doesnt scale as much leaving them to be a less desireable range dps in aq+
---
i'm tired of you too gamer
---
I remember, but it's almost like it fueled him lol
---
I think Joana has the right idea. It's actually pretty far and easy to jump from zone to zone focusing on completing the easiest quests and then moving on and coming back later to do the harder quests.
---
I think I'm going Horde this time, but if I went Alliance again I'd rush to Darkshore first then move on to Westfall/Loch Modan when the quests start getting difficult.
---
For Horde, I'd probably do most of Silverpine, then Northern Barrens, then finish off Silverpine, then do Southern Barrens.
---
A popular private server usees the 1.12 AV and there have still been 48 hour AVs. Don't worry, they will still be good.
---
Darkshore is the move if you're going for speed. But it'll be packed also. Westfall is way too fun to not do. I'll spend my time leveling up because mc clears don't mean too much, you just want to be level 60 when bwl comes out
---
Outside of a few emotes like LUL, most of them don't make any sense based on their name and are just named after their creator's name plus something added to make it different than their other emotes.
---
Pog/Poggers is based off ... fuck, I don't even remember the dudes name because I don't watch him, but he made a surprised/excited face, and it became the go-to emote to express excitement when something impressive happens. Someone just 1v3'd someone? Poggers. Someone just broke a record? Poggers. Someone just scored a date? Poggers.
---
People ironically use this shit outside of twitch now and no matter what server you are on, people will be spamming it in chat like mongoloids. That is the world we live in now and streamers playing or not wouldnt have any impact on that specifically as it is just part of general gaming culture now.
---
Depends really. How close are you to 18? Have you got a bunch of quests (eg Deadmines) that can be completed in one go? If so, then yeah, you're doing pretty well. Just try to avoid falling further behind, or they're going to outlevel you to the point where you might not get to dungeon/do elite quests together. Of course you might not mind that.
---
So you are holding yourself against all other classes except 2 and you are crying how unfair it is?
---
I never understood how using a 3rd party program to emulate keystrokes across the secondary / tertiary / etc instances of the game. That sounds like an extremely fine line to be walking if you ask me. I know they have never banned for it in the past but IMHO it does seem like it could be ruled as a bannable offense. Just my two cents, no need to downvote
---
I guess I'll be the first to say male. I think they have one of the best models in the game in any armor.
---
Zygor guides has been selling levelling addons for years. 
---
The actual addon is free but you pay for the guide "plugins" as a form of loophole.
---
&gt;why Blizz allow this Pay to Win practice? Of course, they profit from it,
---
you've answered your own question
---
&gt;And why do Blizz disallow account sharing? Of course, they would lose some money
---
again you've answered your own question
---
It's not cosmic, account sharing robs Blizzard of subscription money.  Multiboxing gives Blizzard more subscription money.  They're a business.
---
I don't think there's anything else to it.
---
who cares man.... shadow priests are the least fun class in the game with no outplay potential, and warlocks arent that fun either. If they wanna waste their time with easy classes than let them and get a shadow reflector. also in group pvp all those dots are just gonna get dispelled anyways
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would love to see someone rip Asmon or Gay Chances face in half with a box cutter on stream, but I think their impact on the game will be minimal
---
It‚Äôs all about the stats. 
---
Saw MC tanks swap in a piece of cloth for higher sta
---
Male orc warriors and hunters.
---
Female orc literally everything else, imho.
---
It's not one person, it's the dozens of people following them around. Any area that the streamer is in will become unplayable because of all the people following them around. You'll also have to deal with their obnoxious fans spamming twitch memes in chat.
---
If the % of people multiboxing is very low then blizzard probably doesn't care.
---
As long as it's not automated, they get to make alllll the gold :)
---
Yeah basically what /u/Tenoke said.
---
* Nobody in the thread:
---
* Nobody at all in the thread mentioning streamers: 
---
* You: Wow streamers I hate the streamer circlejerk it‚Äôs everywhere!
---
In classic you get exp if you did enough damage but it wasn't the full exp.
---
Undead rogue. A man of culture.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Perhaps, but I got triggered over them asking *specific* questions without having a clue what they are talking about. I'm always happy to answer questions like, "are hunters good in PvP", "are hunters fun to play in your opinion", etc.
---
Without catchup mechanics the phases are irrelevant. Play the game at your own pace. Don't rush trying to keep up with the Jones's. That's how you turn a fun game into a job/chore and burn out quickly.
---
You would be a hunter
---
&gt; Nostalrius team had NOTHING to do with building classic wow
---
Except if Nostalrius didn't exist, neither would classic wow
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but there are multiple guides showing that it is indeed possible to do it by 40.
---
Private servers have 10k+ people at peak. Classic servers are not going to have a population cap that high because the population cap in vanilla wasn't that high.
---
No ret paladins though.
---
Competition can make it harder, but even with competition you'll probably level faster if you focus on doing green quests. You need to spread out to multiple zones for that, though. So you'll be traveling more, but completing quests faster and levelling quickly
---
Yep, and I‚Äôm going to be excited when it‚Äôs gone. You can‚Äôt possibly fathom how that is relevant in a thread in which ‚Äúwhat are you excited about‚Äù is asked?
---
Have a feeling the first break from no changes will happen with world bosses.
---
On streams people were getting full exp even with doing little to minimal damage, Not sure if this has been changed since but ive seen people basically exploiting guards to kill stuff for full exp
---
Good question, glad you agree though, thought I was losing my mind. I wasnt just speaking just duels though, they're pretty much OP in WPvP, duels and even battlegrounds that are organized
---
It does as its told. T2 armor complete set or bust.
---
EU Eonar in vanilla and EU Darkspear in TBC we called it DM.
---
You act like zones won't have people in them... Zones are gonna be packed regardless dude. And guess what, those streamers are more than likely gonna be so far ahead of you that those dozens of people following that one guy around... you're bitching about things that are just gonna happen regardless if a streamer is on the server or not. There will always be competition in an area regardless if a streamer is in it or not. stop giving them so much credit for something they don't even do
---
Bad bot
---
Did you say sumfin b?
---
I dont like it either. Its a terrible design that locks you to certain talent tree. No wonder it got fixed in tbc. Hopefully, they will replace drops for tokens in the far future
---
I can't imagine that is correct but it has also been 14 years so lol
---
&gt; coolest race
---
go troll
---
If i remeber corectly it safe, there is no world pvp and there is no flag to pvp, so you are safe, you can play in bgs pvp but world nope.
---
You are not flagged in any zone unless it‚Äôs a capital enemy city (orgrimmar, stormwind etc) afaik.
---
This sub is so happy to downvote things, so reactionary.
---
Layering, welcome to classic.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm off on which pserver but afaik they have them removing damage reduction completely from glancing blows. Whereas that wasn‚Äôt possible in vanilla.
---
Also the GitHub thread has no data for +10 weapon skill or high enough to get max reduction of penalty.
---
Didn‚Äôt use any finishing moves on my first rogue I ever made because I didn‚Äôt understand mechanics. Just opened with backstab from stealth and sinister strike the rest of the way.
---
Haven't played vanilla WoW since well, vanilla WoW.
---
I hopped on a pserver that was blizzlike, did a 1-40 test run with Questie, and dinged 40 @ 2 days 3 hours /played.  This is with about 3 bars of rest(I intentially didn't log out in an inn to accumulate rest)
---
Just the existence of Questie now will halve the /played time for nearly all players.
---
Maybe shadow priest, but shadow priest is good at BGs and duels, they definitely have potential in WPvP. Warlocks on the other hand excel, especially if they know how to use their spells at the right time
---
Or use the Nvidia shadow play. All graphics cards have a program for filming
---
please do that, you're in for a big surprise
---
Nice username though
---
Only negativity is from those that roll pvp servers and only get satisfaction from "ganking" players 10 levels under them :)
---
How do you think it will fare? Mostly going dmg thru spells and shapeshift just to get out of snare?
---
I didn't get berserker stance untill like lvl 56 because I didnt know about class quests. A fellow warrior told me about it because I had asked him what the "angry head" above his head was.
---
The only difference is that you aren't automatically flagged when entering a contested zone. Entering enemy zones will still flag you automatically.
---
So, how do contested zones work?
---
You have to flag yourself for PvP by typing a command or engages in battle. People used to be tricked into entering PvP status by healing or accidentally attacking a character.  You‚Äôll still be able to BG and engage in world PvP. People will just not be able to gank. 
---
I find it ruins an interesting point of gameplay and interaction, but if you‚Äôre just raiding or BGing it won‚Äôt matter past leveling.
---
What's FedEx 1-10
---
Reread what you just said and think to yourself how fucking stupid you sound. It sounds more like you're jealous that these people get handed things to them. I most certainly do remember the days before cross server, isn't as bad as you remember or think. And you act like there isn't gonna be some other people out there gonna be "stupidly overpowered people" on your server??? You don't think elitists still exist??? Oh sweet dear child, BFA has done some things to your mindset.
---
Didn't a CM leave a blue post recently somewhere reaffirming that Dire Maul wasn't even released at the start? Are people saying that players just naturally used the name of the boss for just one dungeon for almost 5 months before Dire Maul released?
---
Females look better in armour, but a male orc may help you channel your inner Angwe better.
---
Though it would refer to a similar action, it would still be slightly incorrect. 
---
A tell connotates the usage of both
---
/t¬†&lt;player_name&gt;¬†&lt;message&gt;
---
/tell¬†&lt;player_name&gt;¬†&lt;message&gt;
---
Either of which are literal mechanics hard coded into the game.
---
Calling a "Tell" a "DM" is akin to being outside and calling  the "ground" the "floor". We know what you mean. But it's not really what you think it is.
---
Name your character assmoangoal
---
You can flag yourself for pvp so there is world pvp
---
Shrek 2 c",)
---
I'd take them in group PvP, warlocks can dot anyone up, drain their mana while I side heal and the priest just mind frays
---
Kevin Jordan says that in one of the countdown podcast episodes. I think one of the earlier ones. But I'm not sure which one.
---
It's probably not true any more - but in vanilla, i believe it.
---
That is actually a pretty smart raid schedule.
---
I'm planning on rolling Dwarf Hunter come launch. There's a few reasons I prefer Dwarf over Night Elves.
---
1) Stoneform is just more generally usable than Shadowmeld. It's good against Rogues, other Hunters, and SPriests particularly, but the extra armor can help against Warriors too.
---
2) Shadowmeld is in a bad state in the 1.12 patch. You can't use it in combat, so you have to feign death first (but you almost always want to save feign death to lay a freezing trap down in pvp). Also it breaks immediately when casting so you can't do a Aimed Shot from stealth like you could in earlier patches in vanilla. It has a pretty niche use and isn't that effective even when you pull it off.
---
3) To get full use out of Shadowmeld you need to have a Cat pet with Prowl. While cats are decent, they're not the only pet type out there. Bats, Boars, and Wind Serpents are also very viable for PvP, and I don't want to be pigeonholed into using a Cat just so I can make use of my racial.
---
&gt; You are not flagged in any zone unless it‚Äôs a capital enemy city (orgrimmar, stormwind etc) afaik.
---
They are neutral unless you are flagged for PVP and another faction also flags. 
---
It basically just completely minimizes world PVP, that‚Äôs it.
---
What about 2005?
---
Eh we dont know this for sure.  I can definitely see a world where we get a high cap with layering and what not in motion and then of course there will be server population drop off.   People think realms are going to be 4-5k cap,  which while thats a good number for a server, I doubt blizz will limit it that low.  Maybe after layering tapers off and log in queues take effect there will be a cap of that, But during launch i assume server caps are going to be pretty high
---
Not sure why people were downvoting you for stating your opinion. People get so butthurt when they hear things they don‚Äôt agree with. The downvote button should be for people being trolls or posting factually incorrect information, not for people engaging in discussion. /rant

talent trees, the adventure of getting to a dungeon or raid, exploring old azeroth and hanging out with my friends in wow again. me and my cousin made a video about what we're most excited about, got kinda carried away anyways its here if anyone wants to listen to us waffle on about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuIPZxoOLiQ&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuIPZxoOLiQ&amp;t=4s)
---
BROADCASTING MAN BAD
---
PvEasy servers don't allow non-consensual PVP combat in any contested zones or zones your faction controls.
---
They also tend to have a faction imbalance of 2:1 in favor of the Alliance, which a lot of people just don't like.
---
If you enter a red zone you can be attacked by any of the opposing faction but can not attack any of the other faction unless they attack you first, correct?
---
If you enter an orange zone who can attack who? I assume people who are flagged are treated the same as the above example but how does one flag themselves?
---
Oh I see. So it was always VC, and we don't include pre-Dire Maul times because they're not real.
---
Thank you
---
Fun fact: when I started playing I thought high level players LFG DM Tribute meant doing nostalgia runs of Deadmines.
---
"PeOpLe FoLlOwInG sOmEoNe tHaT iSnT mE wIlL rUiN mY eXpErIeNcE!"
---
We already know they aren't using dynamic spawn rates, so it's either vanilla server caps or high pop servers get fucked over because there are more people than the game was designed for.
---
If you don't know the game, why don't you ask for a clarification first? Like, you don't know how rank grind works and how raid spots work. Ask this first.
---
I still was too rude and apologize for that. The answers are, 
---
* forget about R14 for now (although in theory it is possible), and 
---
* hunters have decent chances for a raid spot (although no one can ever have a "sure spot", again, what did you mean by it? You log at any time and are instantly invited to any raid you want to do?). Every raid needs a few hunters and can bring a few more.
---
I cant agree more.
---
Im too old hahahahahaa forget thing but i played a little on pve server when i start playing,  then full pvp coz of friends....
---
I've searched every possible resistance gear for shaman and still get hard countered, gear definitely plays a part in PvP but when a class can be undergeared and still win, i see that as a slight problem. Basically anyone who has played and EARNED their gear can just to get rolled by 2 classes that can smack you around with level 45 gear at level 60
---
That must have been a long grueling process lol. Especially because of how slow you are in rank 1 stealth
---
I think I remember hunters going to the gates of enemy cities and taming a level 5 boar and using eyes of the beast to annoy people until they attack the pet, which flags them for pvp and then they camp them? Is that right?
---
I dislike wow streamers as much as the next guy but yikes brother this comment is rough
---
you have to type /pvp
---
Multiboxing = subhuman activity
---
[Great summary of how classes function in PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU).
---
That‚Äôs really cool, thank you!
---
Less of a joke in 2005 than 2006. Which is just true of almost every raid.
---
How does one flag themselves for pvp besides engaging someone who is already falgged?
---
Yeah, i hope it doesnt work that way.
---
Well its pretty sure streamers were given access to beta for marketing purposes, so I dont see it being impossible for them to have priority to make sure they can keep showing the game to viewers. But hey... its just a theory... game theory. :P
---
it might take a bit longer due to the high pop but nowhere as long as running to mulgore does
---
I believe the command was /pvp
---
It should be pretty hard to split into diff layers and I doubt there will be more than 3 or so per server, if they intend on them each having the same pop as vanilla launch.
---
There aren't any basically. You have to type /pvp to force your flag on. You aren't flagged for pvp anywhere but enemy cities. So no one attacks you ever on PvE server.
---
I'm not the other guy, but I 99% agree with you. Except multiboxers. It's approaching pay to win territory. I will shamelessly camp every multiboxer I come across, and no one else.
---
I assume you are probably playing on One of those instant 60, full BiS PvP servers.  
---
They are are not at all indicative of what the actual PvP scene will be like. After BWL and ZG the gear for casters gets a significant boost. Prior to this gear level Warlocks, Shadowpriests, and Elemental Shamans are significantly worse and are hardly ever seen in BGs.  
---
It takes a significant amount of time and effort to get a toon decked out in this kind of gear. On these private servers, everyone is a Grand Marshal or Highwarlord. The stamina alone provided by these sets will throw off the pvp balance.
---
Dozens of people in one area past launch hype is not normal. I'm not sure why you think that zones having that many people in one area is what vanilla was like.
---
This subreddit was never good, it's just an image board for shit memes
---
dps warriors dont really want the tier sets anyway though because they are all tank stats, which is unfortunate because the tiers are pretty badass looking lol.
---
Also something people don't seem to often realize is that everything takes time. Lots and lots of time. Blizzard probably started working on TBC before even releasing vanilla or at least started working on it quickly after release. These days they are always working on the expansion after the one they haven't even released yet. Similarly Classic WoW was announced almost 2 years ago. It took 2 years to get it out. If we want something to be released in 2-3 years then they need to start on it now or otherwise it'll take like 5+ years from release.
---
And the fact that PVEasy servers usually have a huge faction imbalance in favor of the Alliance by 2:1 or more.
---
It will, 100% for sure. And if you think $15 is the only thing you're losing when you're getting banned, idk what to tell you :)
---
Good point, although what about their casts? They hit for just as much, got critted 2K from a single cast
---
my friends want to go Horde so that will be interesting, LOL
---
Something like that. I mostly played on PvP I just recall people laughing in chat about how to fuck with people. Never did it myself.
---
Worth pointing out that initially undead were undead too, so they could be shackled, they couldn't be poly'd etc etc
---
No one can attack anyone, unless they turn there flag on by typing /pvp.
---
The only exception is capital cities, your flag is auto-turned on when you enter them.
---
Are you sure, I feel like if you enter a red zone (the enemies green zone) that you will auto flag, no?
---
You're right, theyd probably help in 1vs1 situations, just pricey and a pain to obtain
---
Perfect, thanks
---
I hope that a bit after Naxx, they do try and launch a few special servers, with cool things like incremental level caps, some kind of Ironman mode (like in Runescape, but i don't know how you'd do it for WoW), possibly additional content servers, and stuff like that. Obviously these are just ideas, it'd have to be polished to be implemented - but there are a lot of fun side servers you could launch.
---
I can't seem to find Details
---
True
---
There aren't orange zones. Only green and white. You get flagged with PvP by enabling it with /pvp, engaging in PvP by attacking someone 3lse that's flagged, visiting one of the enemy major cities or doing entering a battleground. PvP mode stays until you haven't *refreshed* its status for 5 minutes or do /pvp again (which starts the 5 minute timer aswell).
---
I honestly can't imagine it should. From my memory you had to do a set amount of damage (like 40%?) to get exp or loot.
---
Memes never die, except for Harambe and that is why he is a meme. Dicks out for Harambe, never forgive never forget.

Watching the beta streamers I'm very surprised none of them seem to manage inventory space well. They are constantly looking for something they can delete to make space and their bags are all a mess. I keep my inventory incredibly organized. Everything I don't or won't need in the immediate future gets mailed to alts. I keep my bags clean and I always have space. Sell every time you get the chance. Mail every time you get the chance. Don't be a lazy slob.

---
i have to laugh at these threads. the comments are also always filled with Retail apologetics and shilling too, it's quite hilarious. i think you guys should form your own non-toxic community and leave us alone.
---
I just assume they will cap servers pretty high(maybe 8-10k maybe even 15k max, Just an assumption), And use layering to smooth it out. and then once they remove layering if that server is still too high of a pop, they will offer server xfer to less populated server or people will just have to wait in queue.    I dont think blizzard wants to turn away  players because the server they want to play on is full at 4-5k.   As much as blizzard is making good moves for classic, they arent going to make choices that stop people from playing/paying ie; layering and most likely high server caps to start
---
For a long while I didn't twig on there were 3 separate talent trees so put all my talent points into Arcane as a mage. The day I found out and respecced was great.
---
I distinctly remember a world chat as well. I t was removed before Bc I believe
---
Reddit is one big circle jerk
---
Even if you enter their zone. Like an undead rogue in goldshire isnt flagged for pvp? UGH!
---
I agree, but what about the people that arent geared? Even in level 50 blues they completely blast health away on these servers. I'm guessing playing elemental shaman in classic is also gonna be a pain? looks like I'm gonna have trouble gearing
---
Don't feed the trolls.
---
White zone, lol. This right here sums up the PvE experience, lol
---
I don't remember 100%, but I don't think thats the case because I feel like I distinctly remember Alliance players not being flagged in Tirisfal Glades when they were doing Scarlet Monastery runs.
---
You don't run DireMaul, you run DireMaul East(DM-E), DireMaul West (DM-W) or DireMaul North(DM-N). But yes, the confusion came about because some people started calling it VanCleef instead of DM and then they just didn't care.
---
Multi boxing has always been semi pay to win. Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted for hating on multi boxers, they‚Äôre as close to cheaters as you could get without breaking TOS
---
To be fair min maxing and enjoying the game are not mutually exclusive lol. You can enjoy the benefits of min maxing just as you can enjoy not caring about it. 
---
I really don't get why we have to act like you're not having fun if you min max. People are different. Some people are just super competitive and some enjoy being carefree.
---
They are putting more effort into classic than live.  Live players will play whatever Blizz gives them, for the most part.
---
Blizz knows if they mess this up the community will outrage and pservers will be coming back in droves.
---
This is an entirely different box of crayons with a VERY different community than live. They know this.
---
for what purpose grasshopper?
---
You shouldnt dot everyone up because you want to CC the enemies with sheep and traps
---
Okay
---
Although they're overpowered, I do think they're boring, just spam dots and cast, it doesnt take much skill
---
but can i do the quest as orc, or  orcs and trolls need to do the quest in valley, and taurens in mulgore?
---
Does Kiss of the Spider stack with Slice n Dice?
---
YUCK!
---
Yeah, thats kind of what i remember as well. But seeing streams playing the beta and getting full is a slight turn off
---
I'll take your word for it, I haven't played bfa. I can't wait to play classic till I'm sick of it.
---
A jailhouse style, cheek to ear cutting, then maybe the assailant can hit one over the top of the head from the forehead to the back of head. Leave the skin flaps hanging down, that‚Äôs not really that rough is it?
---
That is true, but it will also just happen naturally that people that the 5-10 people who are "in you area" are shattered across different maybe 3 layers in your area. I just meant it as an example of how layering can make it even easier for people ahead.

Someone do lock T3 so i can decide if it‚Äôs actually a cool set REEEEE
---
It depends on the server. If there is only 1 real guild then sure it will always go to them. But I feel most servers will have at least 3-4 guilds competent enough to try to contest for world bosses.
---
Don't hang around here much so sorry for not knowing, don't want to make a thread either since it's probably asked all the time.
---
Do we know if they will send out anymore beta invites? I'm not hoping for one, but it would be good to know. Maybe they don't even announce it and you guys have no idea either.
---
Wait till you face POM-Pyro mages

Begged for gold to put icy enchant on a white weapon at like level 12

I always thought the outdoor area near RFD was cool. A dusty old valley with a secret side entrance to Thousand Needles, and a boars head you have to walk through to get to the dungeon.
---
being butthurt about not being in the beta is spergy af but so is unironically saying "toxic"
---
Thanks for reminding me I need to get my bank alt to level 5 I had forgotten.
---
Not looking forward
---
I can‚Äôt decide if I like or hate this set and it throws me off from rolling lock as my main game goal is to raid Naxx some day
---
Yes :) I am thinking of levelling one again :)
---
thats kinda my thought process right now but its hard to tell, a lot of people that didnt play classic would have a hard grasp of a boss that doesnt drop loot right off the bat
---
Hi, /u/rochenExklusive
---
What's your definition of overpowered?  SL locks have counters in duels and are bad in premades.  Seems fine to me.
---
I'm currently making a spreadsheet of mob XP, quest XP, quest types. Going to try to find groups for the "Kill X of Y" quests, avoid the "Kill Y and loot item Z" quests. I'll try to grab the quests where you collect world items first, because waiting for them to respawn will suck. Hoping to rush level 5, then try and grind whatever mobs I can, focusing upon selected quests where I think there will be an overlap. Going to try to grab tailoring early, then sell bags, craft more bags, maybe level enchanting if I can grind/buy enough cloth to make the uncommon robes. Ideal world would be to start crafting/selling wands.
---
I‚Äôm assuming there will be more invites along with templates later on to test raids. Right now they‚Äôre testing leveling and don‚Äôt need as many people for that I guess.
---
I agree.  I plan on playing for a month at least.  I don't come here to make a troll thread through lol.  Just let the players find out when it happens.
---
Basically boomers vs zoomers
---
Yes, but temporary enchantments (WF/whetstone) don't stack on each other.

Must be a BfA player, can't even troll as good as vanilla.

They could even try increments as small as 5 levels. The stress test was a lot of fun even though we could only get to level 5 the first time and 10 the second time. There was even a booming economy.

Wouldn't play beta even if I had a free subscription and a key.

You should start your research on youtube. You might find the holy reckoning build interesting.

Fucking streamers keeping me from playing /s
---
The zone's text was written in white.
---
PvE experience is nice if you don't like your time being wasted. You can still do most PvP content (BGs and duels) but are safe from world PvP which is unfair ganking 9 out of 10 times. I'm too old for that shit. The epic scale mass battles are sure fun and memorable but happen way too less frequently to make me roll on PvP realm.
---
No Theramore/Stonard in classic at least right?
---
yeah IIRC once your 50 u are able to get the MC attunement quest. I wouldnt be shocked to see people try and do raid content on beta if the cap is raised to 50
---
Actually on my server we used to say "VC me". People used to "slide into your VCs"
---
Because I'm not perfect and I can't control myself sometimes
---
Any day now the people who have been playing vanilla over the past decade on private servers will get bored of it!  im sure of it! If i had to guess its going to be tomorrow, I know i said that yesterday but this time itll be true.
---
Hi not perfect and i can't control myself sometimes, I'm dad.
---
&gt;opportunity to meet and play with a lot of people I've seen on Twitch
---
HE SAID THE T WORD. GET HIM BOYS /s
---
Good to know.  I remember climbing up to the IF air field back in Vanilla, but I thought they patched that kind of climing out before TBC hit.
---
An undead in gold shire will be auto flagged for pvp. If you go in enemy territory you will be flagged.
---
Classic ain't even out yet and these guys are already legends. What's their twitch? I assume they are streaming.
---
Unstoppable Force was my go to for any character I leveled from lvl 60 - 65/66. I never tried it during vanilla because I played a mage or priest then, but I can‚Äôt see any reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad option if you get it upon dinging 60. 
---
Not looking at any other 2h that will be out, just what I used.
---
I'm not sure how me explicitly saying I'm not jealous makes me sound like im jealous. You think thousands of people swarming a streamer in one zone wont effect the server stability or log in times? You think a hand full of people with infinite gold and carries wont effect the competitiveness of the server. You think a fan base which is extremely subject to stop playing if the streamer doesn't play won't effect the economy? Or all the top guilds being streamer guilds with reserved legendaries? None of that will effect the experience of other players?
---
It's not the streamers fault and i can see why a lot of people want to play on a server with their favourite streamers, but to claim that it doesnt effect the server is insane lol
---
idk, i enjoyed the isle of QD. Was a PvP hotbed.
---
The argent tournament was garbage though. Neutral zone and the jousting was fuuucking boring.
---
I wish I knew exactly what talents my friend was running so I could post them here, but anything demo and destruct is gonna do a shit load of damage, he doesn't even need a healer just pop a health rock and kill his minion for extra health, or damage, either of the two.
---
Would be cool if the first 60 ding on the beta would shut down all the beta servers.
---
Fact is every game dies after like 6 months now a days. Most game are built around hyping up a large amount of people, building anticipation and attention with trailers and such, than deliver a lack luster game, hoping that player base will spend extra on in game purchases, than it all fizzles out. 
---
Blizzard just see the opportunity to get one giant uptick in subscriptions, and that alone is worth it for them.
---
This contradicts what many others are saying, any source for this info? This is how I want it to work but dont know that it will
---
Oops, thanks
---
The primary problems people have with flying are that;
---
it reduces the tangible scale of the world,
---
it reduces the amount of people you run into by adding an additional axis of movement which has both social and world pvp implications, 
---
and it gives players an easier "out" of world pvp by getting out of combat, mounting, and flying away.
---
Personally I think flying could be implemented in a way that doesn't have as much impact by adding a stamina bar like breath when swimming, and by only allowing flying mounts to be mounted in towns at a flight master. Once dismounted you have to use your old reliable ground mount. Maybe even saying flying mounts are more skittish and dismount you when simply entering combat unlike ground mounts. 
---
This could add a new exploration gameplay element as a side effect;
---
reaching floating islands further away from a town than your mounts stamina allows would require landing and running on the ground for a bit to regen, risking combat and getting dismounted.
---
On ysondre us (which was a small server) we called it vc
---
Well, the topic has been discussed a \*LOT\*, so there's probably not too much merit repeating all the arguments again. Generally, feel/immersion of the world (actually being in the world makes you feel much more connected to it, vs. just hovering above) and, aside from your own experiences, significantly impacted world PVP are some of the biggest factors.
---
Awesome thanks! I look forward to tanking the most!
---
Sounds convincing enough, rolling lock!
---
Don't you mean 12 years and 363 days? Unless you're going to start classic 4 days late on 31st August.
---
...do you never watch anything that's not in your native language?
---
shit i think we all got trolled
---
I know but the green, orange, red clearly symbolized what you were getting into. White is just so neutral and passive its sums up PvE experience so well, LOL
---
Why does everyone hate streamers so much?
---
How dare you speak bad about lolcats that stuff was the coolest when I was in elementary school.
---
Aah, I remember the guild Pecado. I've played on Thunderhorn too!
---
Where can I find a list of racials for classic?
---
My source would be my own knowledge lol. If you‚Äôre an ally and go to durotar you‚Äôll be flagged for pvp and ripe for the picking. If you‚Äôre in STV (neutral zone) you won‚Äôt flag for pvp.
---
Can anyone confirm for me that pick pocket values are atleast similar to most pserver values?
---
Everyone can use grenades.
---
Autism
---
I wish I was a boomer, instead I get mixed in with the mumble rap and hoverboard crowd
---
Saw this post saying Thunderhorn EU, that was my realm! Then saw it was Pecado, holy shit I was in that guild! My main was Normund, a mage. I remember everyone in that picture, we had some good times! Doesn't look like I was in that particular raid though.
---
I lost all my screen shots when a hard disk died, do you have any more?

Too bad the troll song meme died years ago, would fit perfect
---
that video was sooo funny i was laughing the fuck out
---
Yes, it's 24:00 on 26th (CET or GMT+1)
---
Thanks
---
Someone else mentioned alliance going for SFK runs or horde going for VC runs. You are saying they would be flagged doing this?
---
Shadow protection potion?
---
Why horde??
---
What is VC and what is that bird saying?
---
Thought it was... not sure tbh. Never played a mage in any expansion so really wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Personally i rather be a mage in world pvp situations than a warlock or priest. I usually have way more agency in 1vX or  XvX as a mage.   warlock and priest is pretty good 1v1 though.
---
Something that helped me decide.. if you are thinking of it due to wanting to be good at pvp, is that I thought of it this way. Yes orc stun resist is really good... but it's also random, so I have to adjust my play style on hoping for a resist? Or be ready to use a resist to my advantage? Ew don't like that rng.. so I'll go undead and know exactly when I'm getting stunned and exactly when I'm the one doing the stuns. Plus can get out of fears on my command ya know.
---
Because it‚Äôs not about the progress alone, it‚Äôs about being able to play the version of the game and get a hint of nostalgia.
---
Okay, did it work?
---
Are bats good hunter pets? I am aware owls have more damage but how much better are they? Or are carrion birds also better ?
---
Yeah they were at least BC if not a Wrath edition
---
The confusion comes from the quest that tells you to go kill VanCleef. People looking to kill VanCleef specifically for the quest would LFM or LFG VC and that made sense in context. Some people just kept using this to denote the entire dungeon and over time on some entire servers (with a generally low IQ) just kept calling it VC instead of DM. This is also an Alliance-only quest, so these people look even more dumb to Horde-only players.
---
So basically both sides are arguing two different things. A lot of people called it VC, maybe even half the servers/population, but it also isn't the correct dungeon abbreviation in any regard. Both sides are wrong and right depending on what they are trying to argue.
---
Warlocks, and Shadowpriests are pretty trash at MC/Pre MC gear levels so I'm not really sure what experience you are having on these servers. Can you maybe elaborate on what you find OP about these classes?  
---
Rogues for example are PVP gods for most of the game. A moderately geared Rogue can kill most non-plate classes just in their opener. But on these private servers where everyone has 5-6k HP Rogues have a rough time. It just not at all representative of the actual game. It's good for practicing your mechanics but that's about it.
---
Play 12-16 hours a day. and be actually getting as much honor as you can in that time
---
Holy shit neck yourself unironically
---
Its simple, dont play retail.
---
Yeah but he's saying that to the op that says he plans on playing just as inefficiently as before but y'all are too focused on minmaxing to even read what he said.
---
having leveled 3 shamans to 60 on private servers I normaly go for a few pieces of each stat. Try to have stam on every piece
---
3-4 piece of stam and intellect
---
3-4 stam and strength
---
3-4  stam and agility
---
i don't really ever go for spirit because unless you have a lot of it, the difference it makes is negligible but there's a couple pieces of stam and int gear that come with it
---
Oh it‚Äôs SO cool. It‚Äôs probably the 5th(?) best out of all the tier sets. Hard to decide but it‚Äôs up there for me.
---
Understanding millennials is an impossible and useless endeavor.
---
Im only invited to the stress tests but details work. I believe soda or hydra has been using it on stream too
---
If you have a wife, divorce them, if you have a job, quit it. You will live solely in the premade, you will run the same bgs 10000000000000 times. Your new wife and new job is winning premades
---
I like your work. Good stuff.
---
Bunch of gamer dads drinking their Monster Zero Ultras talking down to everyone cuz we ‚Äúhave it easy‚Äù. But these will also be the people who are going to raise when when they see all the reserved dungeon runs or more requirements to raid than what was common in 2006
---
Yeah west fall is an alliance zone. Therefore horde going there would be in ‚Äúenemy territory‚Äù and they would auto flag. 
---
The difference between Pve and Pvp servers is that you can be safe from pvp in neutral zones and not flag. Think stranglethorn vale, Tanaris, plaguelands
---
Roll a night elf if you want to, min maxing isn't everything, if you're a good hunter the difference will be negligible. A good hunter of whatever race will always edge out over someone who tries to minmax but is bad. Night elves have higher base agility anyway so if you wanted to PvE at some point they're the better option I believe.
---
I‚Äôm not far from 18 I‚Äôm not really sitting on many quests. I just moved over to Loch Modan and did an elite quest with them. I‚Äôm about to go on another leveling grind.
---
Hey man I‚Äôm just trying to help, if you‚Äôd rather listen to guides based on private servers and third party sites that‚Äôs your choice.  Good luck
---
Thanks! Nothing brings a community together quite like memes!
---
Where's the /chicken?
---
I think it's strange what people call memes these days. Pre 2000 I think you could find 1 of 100 people with college education that knew that word.
---
I hate it too, but there's only one dude I follow and support and he's an aussie player that streams osrs. I get a massive hard on when an Australian speaks and uses slang. If he's not streaming I'm not on twitch. I hide chat and usually put it on my TV.
---
Was it not 6?
---
And yeah, mostly worried about mages/locks
---
If you're going to do some real gold farming you'll want to be able to solo-farm.
---
That said, if you're just financing your epic mount and raid day consumables you'll be completely fine grouping up.
---
Thanks! The 1 handers are so good, I didn't know the nelfs even had a separate quest, so I wasn't sure.
---
Razer Orbweaver.    https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-orbweaver-chroma
---
Oh fuck you're right...
---
What's the addon saying mana gained and which attack used
---
population per server, not the game as a whole  
---
they already said they are going with the pop cap per server game had back in 2005  
---
meaning max 3k per server, which is rather small considering it means there will be 3k players online only at peak hours after some time
---
Yes it was nerfed, but the time investment depends on so many factors you can't really come up with an estimate.
---
Catch_88, fuck off nazi
---
Something that has me worried about classic is that now that almost everyone has played through live wow, won't classic be viewed as much simpler and lead to more min / max style characters and crazy trick pulls etc that took literally years to learn right from the get go in classic?
---
It's not going to stop me from playing, it's just got me curious for what's in store for the average player that doesn't know those tips / tricks.
---
You can heal in raids you have to be in a mele group sins you don't have mana tide or imp mana totem and you can only heal the raid you need shorter cast time to be able to heal tanks in raid but there are always raid healers needed and shamans are the best at it. Remember to talk to your raidleader/classleader and tell them your spec it is ultimately up to them to decide if they want to raid whit you in that spec
---
Careful you'll get murdered for saying those words in here
---
Good thing I don't watch Twitch.
---
Meh I don‚Äôt know the mech rider is bad enough to not make me want to play a gnome
---
That area is way too crowded. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the rush of players flooding in because of Classic hype.  But I‚Äôve noticed much higher density and in some cases, too many mobs stacked on top of each other.
---
Like in deadmines, before the instance there were like 30 miners all spawned on top of each other viscously murdering anyone going into DM.
---
People that aren't able to construct sentences without a twitch emote have really started to annoy me. I had two guild mates that would do that while talking over voice chat...
---
I‚Äôm just wondering how accessible they will be on launch. It doesn‚Äôt seem too hard to get Enchanting to 50 or whatever for the lesser wand but in a bit worried about it as that wand is HUGE to have ASAP
---
Equipped a world drop on my level 53 warrior called Twig of the World Tree that I got from Un Goro. Proceeded to equip another weapon and vendor it because I didn't understand stats... I just wanted to use an axe again lol
---
12 weeks of  being number 1 on your server (in a row)
---
Good luck.
---
I did also dinged 60 on winterspring, but I grinders those ghost on the frozen lake. Can't remember the mobs and the lakes name
---
Is there any (hitbox or other) benefits to being a female tauren druid rather than a male?
---
I wish I knew the spells exactly, but when it comes to priest their shadow damage just eats everything. Their dots are on par with Warlocks and when they get low they can just pop a shield and heal, it's pretty simple stuff but very effective.  Warlocks on the other hand, if you choose the right talents it's over in PVP. Not only can they heal and have a strong output damage, they can eat your mana away without even hitting half health.
---
I hate Tauren warriors, they block the mob with their big ass body
---
I bought taran the icebreaker for my feral druid cause i wanted to have an epic item to gain respect.
---
Female hands down. Male orc is too big and blocky for a rogue
---
Anyway, which players are you referring to?
---
Eg har bodd p√• R√∏ros, S√∏r- Tr√∏ndelag i 2 √•r. Y'all got nothing on us.
---
The caps are going to be super high with layering so that the servers survives tourists and gets back to a stable blizzlike pop after a month or two, so we might see 10k servers, it depends how large a % of the players blizzard thinks will be tourists.
---
Mage is decent, I've gone against really good ones. It also seems a lot more fun, they're one of the few who can hold their own against priests and locks because cloth wearers get a shitload of shadow and fire resistance
---
I agree though
---
its amazing to see all of these older people commenting on their lack of understanding of new communities and ideas, makes me afraid to grow old.
---
Wind fury
---
&gt;Tfw you stab the reactor but didn't realize the tip of your dagger was made of graphite
---
You shouldn't ever die in world pvp in a 1 on 1 as a holy pally except for some really good rogues and maybe warriors. 
---
If you're seriously looking at HW / GM titles though they always need solid healers.
---
Might be the solution honestly
---
Followed!
---
You can say sure, but you're definitely in minority.  
---
There is a reason almost every multiplayer game has "daily quest" system in it. It encourages players to "not miss the bonus" and log in every day.  
---
I personally also do not like "hey better login or you'll miss X!" type of games.
---
It's a long shot, but game key + Jan Michael Vincent could be enough to convince someone working at support. I've heard of people taking over accounts with less.
---
I think your bound to your race area with the first and second totem quest at least. But not 100% sure.
---
better like and subscribe instead of just telling us the results...
---
And what are we gonna do about it? Do you want a public outcry and a protest outside Blizz HQ to demand Warlock and shadow priest nerfs because you can't counter them as Shaman?
---
Just deal with it. This is what Vanilla was all about, unbalance.
---
Not true. Layers can have 2 to 3k players and they said servers will have more than a couple layers
---
Yeah Im trying to only play pserver on weekends so I dont get burned out. Already found a few things that will help in Classic.
---
I have about 5 classes around lvl 20 with different professions.  Still deciding on what profession I want on my main in classic but I do have a main and leveling route worked out.
---
I'd rather have neither, and I wouldn't be willing to pay extra to see that.
---
You forgot "2004 account no invite wtf"
---
All progress made in any game is irrelevant
---
Those private servers are not usually true classic.  Many have xp boosts and xp bonuses.   You are being sarcastic but not doing it well.
---
They added the option to cancel any flight in the middle of it which meant they had to be able to reroute easily and quickly. Because of that everything had to be adaptable and therefore static. Also a lot less work to animate.
---
spriests blow dick in pve but are PVP gods.
---
ele shaman is literally useless in pve but ok in pvp. totem control is universal across all shaman specs.
---
Locks are ok in pve and great in pvp as well. I'm sure blizz will be keeping with the 16 slot debuff max meaning many of your curses etc will not even be applicable during certain phases of raids meaning little to no damage going out.
---
I think it will be more like it was on the stress test. Something along the lines of this:
---
INVITE ME TO ASMON / ESFAND LAYER
---
Something like that.
---
Is this in a BG? In a duel? In Wpvp? Is it on a server where you get all your BIS gear for free?
---
Have you played vanilla? Healers dont really dps unless content is on farm mode or it's a light healing boss
---
It's really not a complicated game. You could hop on a private server now with an instant 60 and you could master any class inside-out in a week if you really wanted to.  
---
Crazy trick pulls: "ok everyone in the raid stand on Square, run when square runs."  
---
That's all there is to it. You see someone do it on stream or video and then you can easily copy it.
---
You need some sort of symbols in text speech otherwise it feels soulless. Twitch emotes are literally perfect system created, because they can convey literally any emotion spectrum you can think of.
---
There are two kinds of old people. Rise above.
---
Because it hasnt on private servers and private servers have been proven to be overtuned compared to Classic time and time again.
---
"We're going to hunt you. Cricket."
---
No sorry. It‚Äôs a dumb post. No one cares. Apologies.
---
I don't trust loot councils at all unless I know the people very well, especially if they are cliqued up, and they always are.
---
Rogue is in the holy dps trinity of mage warrior and rogue. They scale incredibly well throughout tiers and with gear are pvp monsters
---
The leveling meta is not dungeon running. Its questing and grinding
---
It's six seconds at rank 4, three seconds at rank 1.   
---
So you're technically both correct on the duration part.  
---
He is completely wrong on the cooldown part though, it's 1 min untalented, 45s talented.
---
It is.
---
Thank you for responding but I still don't see why people want it removed from the expansion. 
---
I always ran into people due to dailies/WPvP events in Nagrand, Terokkar, Hellfire, and Zangarmarsh as well as other daily areas/hotspots like the netherwing questing area/raid entrances/dungeon entrances like Auchindoun.
---
Like, the spirit towers, twin spire ruins, the stadiums in hellfire peninsula and Halaa were insane. You could escape on your flying mounts but then you'd cease control to the other faction. They forced you into combat and I still participated at level 70. 
---
I can see how it reduces the tangible scale of the world since you're flying over areas most of the time but the Outlands was designed for that. It would be a terrible feeling to not have flying and also try to complete daily quests, I just don't see how they can solve that issue.
---
There will be a large surge of guilds looking for a number of classes.  I wouldn't worry about guilds being slim.  I doubt any guild will be unable to clear MC.
---
/s?! /s(ubscribe to my stream) we don't take kindly to your type round here
---
But streamers DO suck
---
Millenials are 22-37 years old. It's the generation after that that's obsessed with twitch.
---
Poor guy, he's terrorized because he knows everybody will switch to classic.  
---
His guild will disband and all his time and investment will be for nothing.  
---
Less money invested in retail means less future content. Low population on his servers.  
---
Enjoy BFA will you can!
---
We will see. I expect undead and human zones to be the worst by far. Dynamic respawn made pservers very manageable unsure if classic will be able to do the same
---
We sure hope so. But even in retail is normal with a xpac lunch to be hard to do quests. Os part of the fun
---
"You're gonna harvest my organs, arnt you? Oh god!"
---
The logic that classic will be empty because it is not BFA is absolutely hilarious. We know where classic is going, it's going to BFA and Beyond.
---
Anyone else excited to kill Sodapoppin in game
---
I'm probably rolling warrior like i did 14 years ago, think i'll do mining, but debating enchanting/skinning as a secondary to try and make money.
---
enhancement shaman does and will work
---
&gt;All graphics cards have a program for filming
---
That's very, very untrue.
---
IIRC, as far as Nvidia goes, only cards starting at GTX 970 (or 960) support Shadowplay. No idea about AMD but I'm pretty sure they started even later. You could also be stuck with a dedicated GPU from Intel if you have a laptop, they don't have any sort of screen recording in their cards.
---
I saw them playing with Stormx
---
One of the core reasons i got into OSRS without any nostalgia, as my childhood was spent playing classic. When i log onto OSRS i feel so free and open to do and play however i please. Dailies dictate how you play the game and to me, it is why most current mmos just arent for me. Hell current wow IMO is hit max level, get ur weekly mythics and mythic + done, do ur emissary cache and wait till raid times. Its lame
---
BfA &gt; Classic
---
Warrior T3 would be amazing!
---
You'll be fine - have fun.
---
Use Searing Totem and weapon enchants. Play hard around the MP5 rule and only cast batches of spells followed by big downtime. IE pull with LB, drop totem, flame shock, and auto attack the mob to death. If you stagger your casts you will never regenerate enough mana. Shaman's auto attacks are some of the strongest, if not the strongest, autos before Fury gets enough hit to duel wield.
---
No not really, classic servesr will launch at over 4k with layering to support all the tourists that classic will have, so it could be 10k but it really doesn't matter since each layer is 3k. But 3k is still a lot on a launch without heavily increased respawns.
---
" This game will be empty after 2-3 months, mark my fucking words. " Like BFA is now?
---
Not watching a video to get a yes or no answer.
---
Nice try, I'll find out elsewhere. It's only 2+ months before it matters.
---
I mean if hunters get alot of spots for raids or they aren't so good and needed. Maybe other classes sre more desirable
---
He probably levelled through vanilla, I started on vanilla and played a few months a year for example. There really wasnt a rush or feeling that you had to be max level to play the game like there is now
---
This is DOPE.
---
Looking forward to making a Nightelf and then doing the Wetlands run to Westfall.
---
"I'm going to make a black list", said once after being stream sniped is "stirring shit up". This entire sub reddit crying for over a week and still going, but isn't "stirring shit up."
---
Not having a hate boner for streamers and applying logic to a discussion instead of jumping on a hate train with no breaks is being a stan.
---
k.
---
Totally understandable, i thought you made good points up until the money part. I share the same ideas that wow is ultimately a waste of time if you over indulge. I suggest not playing if it hinders your ability to progress through the real world but like many of us that play we try to come up with a healthy balance.
---
Going silverpine after tirisfal glades is the fastest option until level 15. After that you are left with quests like the fenris isle and arugal's folly quest chain, which are kinda hard to solo and not very xp efficent. So after level 15 your fastest option would be to head straigth to the barrens and do quests there. On launch however, the barrens might be super crowded and if you arrive late, you might be stuck waiting for spawns. On launch I'd suggest to check out how many ppl are currently questing in the barrens when you are rdy to go there by "/who The Barrens" and adjust accordingly. If you see 100ppl+ just stay silverpine and grind mobs until you hit 20 (its still faster than waiting for respawns), then proceed to do the Hilsbrad Foothils quest chains/ Thousand Needels/Southern Barrens quests.
---
All pets are very similar damage, the difference between cat/bird/dog at 60 would be like 1 or 2% of your total damage.  
---
The reason people like birds is because they can learn screech which is in an aoe debuff (ie. threat generator) which is very handy while levelling when you get an add or have to pull 2+ mobs at once.    
---
The difference between the different types of birds and cats is again very very small. You're not going to notice a difference unless you run a math sim.
---
Might be true but people will switch to classic to try and BfA servers will be empty. At least for those 6 months. Some people will stay. It will kill BfA!
---
What a lot of people don't realize is they will have more fun if they stop coming here and don't watch streams after launch.
---
Lol fury tanking in classic.
---
Atleast I get invited to parties.
---
But Troll Mages can't make portals to Darnassus...
---
if you want to respec there are 2 healing builds one for melee groups and one just pure healing
---
first one for mele groups
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxbdbZEc0tVeqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxbdbZEc0tVeqo)
---
second one pure healing
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZx0zZEfLtVeqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZx0zZEfLtVeqo)
---
they both work perfectly for raid/group healing
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PEPs8xwamE9WOqOujnRbUvmYDwDX_sS0ddctuOROMO8/htmlview?sle=true#
---
? Is there some new development thats going to make it not work?
---
you can dodge those pretty easily, just sayin
---
I don't get it. If we can have both what's all the hate for?
---
I played on a fresh start server a few months ago. The initial zone is heavily congested and even after you immediately get out of the starter area it's kind of rough. However, if you just put the effort and time investment, it seems to thin out a bit after level 10ish, and the level 10-20 zones like Loch Modan and Westfall weren't congested at all.
---
With no dynamic respawning - it might be similar timewise for launch.
---
Even with layering there will still be hundreds of players for dozens of mobs.
---
Only thing I can see being amazing from blizzard is if they are able to stretch layering to dozens of layers per server for that first day.
---
If they could get it to where there aren't 2k players split between 3 starter zones for the first 12 - 24 hours... that would be huge for thinning out the pack.
---
Oh, of course
---
Blizzard needs to stop development on this game. It will kill BfA
---
General players are so upset over beta keys. Wife and I both played prior to the streamer invites and it was ok, small groups and good testing. As soon as the streamers got on though it's not been very fun for the people who were in the first phase. If I could give both our access away I would so others could try it, but obviously not possible. 
---
My suggestion is to just wait to enjoy release and not worry too much about beta.
---
I either masturbate or watch anime. Or both at the same time
---
I have to disagree with your first paragraph. I was a mainly PVE player and personally AV was my favorite BG. I just loved the epic feeling of it. Some people were fighting on the front lines, others were defending capture points and the base, and others were farming materials for quests. It felt like a full-on war in which everyone could contribute in their own way.
---
That said, I didn't play back when the matches would last 24 hours, so I don't know if I would like that. I would like to at least give it a try, but I wouldn't really know unless I experience it.
---
There is one thing that the private server Community could never ever ever emulate. And that is people who wants to play classic go into a server and they play classic. And when they get to the end of classic, they were not expecting to also want to play burning Crusade, but because of the personal investment they made in their characters they decide they want to continue with those characters into burning Crusade. An attachment to characters over multiple expansions is something the private server Community could never manage because it was far too focused on the initial several months into a server and constantly re-rolling.
---
Of course. Every item proc in the game stacks with every talent in the game.
---
Best farming/raid combo is mage. You can farm DM solo for tons of shekels and will always have a raid spot
---
Mob parry rate is way higher (nearly triple @ almost 15%) than it was on private servers where Fury tanking was invented.
---
Stream man bad
---
benis :---DDDDD
---
I like this. I feel like im doing this.
---
I think [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Oilskin\_Leggings](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Oilskin_Leggings) contestants as BiS for rogue
---
OP thinks Twitch chat will overrun game chat even though that' doesn't happen to all the other games that get streamed.
---
there is no world chat.
---
Oh yeah I just meant for leveling. I should have clarified. At max rank I‚Äôll just get a wolf for howl and a cat for pvp push back.
---
Nice... thank you for the link
---
Nothing blizzard offers forces you to do anything. It sounds just like people who felt like they were forced to be in Garrison's instead of going out into the world because they needed to print gold and keep up with everyone else. Nobody forces you to do anything. Blizzard gives you options and you can choose to play however you want to play.
---
On most pservers nowadays the top rankers from both factions will agree on an honour cap so people dont ruin their lives. Its still alot of time and honour though but compared to what it used to be like its much better
---
Or be a full time streamer
---
Guys, is this is how rogues communicate? I want to roll a rogue and really want to get into the role.
---
Just pretend they're bad Chuck Norris jokes and bam, right back into 05/06 Barrens.
---
You are acting like you know much about a topic but not doing it well.      Almost no big private servers have xp boots and xp bonuses and besides that people level to 60 in a week or 2 anyways on those servers and continue to play for 1-2 years. and when the content is done and a new server opens they do it again, because they love the game, not because of exp boosts or because its the new hot game that just came out.     If you arent exposed to how successful vanilla has been and will be thats fine, a lot of people arent.  But to think everyone will get sick of it or it wont be successful is just ignorant.   If its not for you thats fine. :)
---
Google ;)
---
It is 100% a full time job. 12-16 hours MINIMUM a day EVERY day for 2-3 months.
---
If you choose the correct hairstyle, helmets are verboten.
---
There aren't many "great" open world farmers - if you don't go hunter/mage them focus on professions for farming.
---
Holy would be great to raid with, but trash for farming - it's a dilemma that most people who are going into classic solo will face.
---
You either have to farm with people, farm gathering, or have enough gold to switch specs constantly.
---
Healing doesn't have to just be raids either, can make some decent gold running dungeons once we all start getting geared :)
---
Lmao at world design... each expansion past WotLK has felt small and cramped and even linear with how bad the zones are made and laid out.
---
Give me the original hard-packed snowballs and I'm happy
---
hell yea sunken temple is such an underrated dungeon. Had no idea it was there and then you get it and its a HUGE maze it's fantastic.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong but you‚Äôre in subreddit that has some of the most irrational hatred for twitch I‚Äôve ever seen, so don‚Äôt expect a lot of people to agree
---
Hunter and rogues use full  tier gear.
---
This has been discussed to death already, its not going to effect surviving very much considering boss damage is anticipated to be significantly lower and even if it wasnt survivability is not a big deal. If youre the MT of a guild that genuinely needs a fury tank your healers will be good enough and your shield swapping clean enough that there should be no issues.
---
that's not true. it's just whatever faction is more popular. there's a lot of Horde-biased PvE servers, just like there's just as many Alliance-biased PvP servers and vice versa. it's just a random draw.
---
What is monkas, pepehands, lulw and dansgame..?
---
Oh yes it will. Most guilds are switching. People will follow their friends. I really expect BfA to be a ghost town. You'd better find positive about classic or you will have a bad time.  
---
If you never played go read some guides because you will be a complete noob.
---
This video dates from 2017, I'm pretty sure XP wasn't fixed then so this record is meaningless.
---
Even then you would stream nothing but stomp bgs for like 15 hours a day for months. I dont see a lot of streamers going for it
---
I think most classes are pretty good in tier besides like dps wars, enhance shams/ret/moonkins/feral. Basically if you are a hybrid and heal, a pure dps it a tank, tier is good. For example rogue Hunter all healers, war tanks made and lock are all good in tier
---
Would be awesome if you did one with Ten Storms on an Orc. Love the work, it looks great!
---
If you don't have dailies, you don't have reputation earning for different BC factions. If you don't have that reputation you don't have Quartermasters who sell you gear in an effort to provide solo players with a way to get a little bit of gear that they were not able to do in classic. Without that, burning Crusade is more like classic, and many more people would have soured on classic because they would have gotten burned out on this quote on quote classic formula still being around and burning Crusade. That would retroactively affect their opinion of classic negatively.
---
I agree.  Back in vanilla days I'd do a bunch of stuff when I logged in every day: check the AH, make my herbing rounds, make mooncloth if it was of CD, maybe farm for some felcloth.  So in effect I was making *my own* "dailies"; not having activities prescribed to me.
---
Kotaku writes an article about every popular thread on any of the gaming subbreddits.
---
Can't argue with the truth
---
Stop, you're making me depressed
---
Again everything you just mentioned is gonna happen on every server. And the reserved legendaries?? now you're just looking for anything to back your point up, thats something that happens in almost all top guilds.  Like thats something you yourself can avoid, don't join a guild that has a reserved item lmfao... that kind of shit happens regardless of streamers my dude. The only thing that is gonna effect a server from time to time from streamers is if they have some event and it will add a possible que time to the server... Which is something that can happen any fucking way... You're legit just finding ways to REEEEEEEEEEEE at streamers for no reason. If you're worried about any of those things, its not a streamer thing its a wow classic thing. Go play bfa if you're so so worried about competition.
---
We'll see. I don't think it is going to be viable until Naxx is on farm.
---
I played warlock on Nost, and their tier gear (besides tier 3) was pretty dogshit, gave barely gave any spell power, and low crit, and no hit I believe.
---
Had a lot of stam on it tho, so probably good for PvP
---
Hpala is a little broken in naxx T3 iirc
---
Plainstriders drop them too. I usually kill the ones in front of XR every time I pass through
---
Shadow Meld is for people who can be clever with it's use, Stoneform is for if you want to smash a button when attacked by rogues. Nightelves have the highest base agility for hunters as well.  
---
I've had a Hunter of both races, and I always used SM far more than SF.
---
And each person who had their epic Mount knew if they had bought their gold or they had earned their gold and that affected how they felt about what they had.
---
Its not that I don't believe you, just wish I could find some source to prove it.
---
That's an amazing idea.
---
I don't necessarily mind a populated start because it will be awesome to see a ton of people starting together. I see that as a great way to really appreciate how far we've come considering a few years ago we were told we would never get this opportunity to play classic again on real blizzard servers.
---
Then again the speed leveler in me will be screaming "stop touching my boars!".

It's also important to note that it's a beta in testing knowledge instead of fun. Knowing this I'm extra relieved I didn't get an invite because I know I'm not the type of person blizzard wanted for their testing. Perplexity was their ideal person to invite as he spent the first day testing what was true to history and not. Also showing off what is possible with the 2.0 macros.
---
Holy shit, that was awesome! For the Horde!
---
Honestly, I think that's the primary reason we're seeing so much consternation about this stuff now: watching streamers tool around in the beta is the only way most folks can experience Classic right now.
---
Once not-quite-September hits and we can actually play it ourselves I predict things will settle down and chill out significantly around here.
---
Resto shaman
---
That's the retail version, this is the vanilla version: https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=9414 (pretty trash)
---
if you are used to playing on a pvp server, playing pve is going to feel like a nerfed version of the game, dont do it!
---
Ye, outdated
---
It was called VC in Vanilla in some servers: can confirm for Darkspear
---
i bought gold a couple times in vanilla for my army of twinks, and i also got it both times for $20/1000g
---
i don't understand why you think that selling gold to middlemen for $15/1000 is evidence against them reselling it for $20/1000g. that's pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be -  a 33% markup before overhead is pretty standard for an industry with that much competition, that low of a barrier to entry, and that few overhead costs
---
not trying to give you a hard time but this post just struck me as really strange
---
It has srgrafo's name on the bottom right. Is this a repost or his alt account?
---
Just roll EU servers if you are scared for streamers
---
i don't think anyone will clear it on Week 1 either, just because of how long it'll take to level. people have said, allegedly, it takes longer to level on Classic then private servers.
---
it'll definitely be cleared Week 2, though, probably a couple hours after servers come back up.
---
The impression I've gotten is that you're going to kill people slowly with bleeds and Insect Swarm in a hit-and-run style.
---
And the ones that do, will get rank 14
---
Not your fault.  All teenagers are pretty dumb.
---
1. Troll has a slight advantage, but it's nothing like Dwarf Priests and they are the worst choice when it comes to PvP
---
2. The usual PvE spec is 0/5/46 deep Resto which is pretty bad as your damage will be quite low. 30/0/21 Ele/Resto is the "meta" PvP spec and pretty much the build that comes closest to being a "real" hybrid.
---
3. Gold making sucks, but as far as I remember I got most of my gear from doing Dungeons and was already raiding MC before getting my full BiS. The only pieces of gear I remember buying from the AH was Hide of the Wild ( [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18510](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18510) )
---
4. Shamans will be consistently top healers on fights with significant raid damage. Their main job during raids is spamming Chain Heals and keeping up totem buffs, with the occassional clutch NS+Healing Wave combo. Priests will usually heal the tanks.
---
5. I don't think so, if anything the only starter zone without Shamans (Tirisfal) will be the most crowded as Undead are the most popular Horde race.
---
I also rolled on pservers, im mid 20's and was having a blast but dungeons have started killing 
---
 joy. had a few bad groups where people seemed to expect things to be like running in tbc with heirlooms. maybe i wont enjoy this game anymore now that Im older and everyone playing is younger.
---
Warlock gives 2 other people water breathing and then the 3 of them summon an unsuspecting person to the bottom of the ocean and watch them drown while pointing and laughing.
---
Nice personal blog, go QQ some more
---
Is that supposed to be a jab at me or?
---
For an amount of gold no lvl 5 has
---
It doesnt matter people will just rush to vandar or drek, while maximizing honor per hour.
---
Lookup Drakhova on YouTube tons of pvp pally builds for every spec
---
Oh, glad you asked. As of today i have updated the loottables for the entire classicdb so it should be correct now
---
That can happen at release.
---
The 3k people per layer thing comes up a lot as well. I may have missed it, but did Blizz actually say layers were max 3k? Or is this speculation? At work so I can't really search effecitvely.
---
Because that was in burning crusade. Id imagine gold prices in vanilla would be a lot higher than they were in bc.
---
This is great
---
BIS gear and Wpvp and duel, I've had some encounters in BGs, but not as much as the other 2
---
Be a streamer.  Have a legion of fanboys carry you.  Bam R14
---
Ignoring the facts is not ignorant.  http://vanillagaming.org/index.php/features-mainmenu-47.   This classic server has tons enhancements.  There's a reason Blizzard came out with new features and expansions.  People would have quit.  You yourself will quit.  Lol
---
Nobody cares about your kids. You're a dad, aren't you supposed to have responsibilities? Maybe you should stop whining, quit playing videogames and actually start looking after your family for god's sake
---
&gt; So all this talk about "no changes hurr durr" just ZIP IT. i have 5 kids to feed you think i want to walk to stratholme all the way from IF every single time? you think I even have time to do pointless stuff like that just to play the game?
---
Play BFA... or if you choose to play Classic then zip it.
---
&gt;I want to play the game. some of us have real lives and dont have time to walk across the world just to clear a dungeon.
---
Same thing as before, you don't have to play - BFA is available to you.
---
52 talent point shamans best shamans. xd
---
No more content for retail. Classic then BC then wotlk  
---
While they release old content for the next 2-3 years they work on WOW2.  
---
That's clearly the plan. It makes so much sense.
---
I think I've seen a game won before 5 minutes. Meaning alliance won before anything capped.
---
I have also seen games where one alliance Hunter manages to repel the horde offense rush.
---
The best fix really would be to remove honor diminishing returns only in AV and increase the honor gained from PVE objectives. No one will complain about long AVs if they have something to show for it.
---
I dont think threat will be an issue until naxx is on farm either. Current beta tests show battle shout giving fuckloads of threat, and that can‚Äôt miss. People can deep prot until it comes time to speedrun mc or bwl in naxx gear.
---
&gt;my buddies and I are going to play a normal server even though we would like PvP better. We really want to avoid the streamers, plus I know some of us are going to lag behind and this will prevent them from falling to far behind and getting ganked.
---
Like cutting off your dick so you don't chance an STD
---
Don't neuter your WoW!
---
SnD is a spell though, not a passive/talent.
---
Yea, I mean... if you repeat that same 24 days played to hit 60, then you probably wont be hitting it until late next year.  Although that all depends on how many hours a week you intend on playing.
---
For priest you wont use much of T1, but T2 and onwards you use plenty of pieces. You often wont get bis as well, or at least for a long time.
---
[only hunters will understand this](https://i.imgur.com/oZFhBUX.jpg)
---
Was just wondering cause there were massively better pieces available than the garb at that point for locks
---
It's like some kind of animated postage stamp...
---
Make your rogue and enjoy it my dude! I'm rolling an undead rogue to duel level with my buddy who's rolling and undead warlock.
---
Bshout gives a static amount of threat and less based on how many mobs around (it splits up evenly). It's great on lower levels, but ain't going to be as great at 60.
---
Okay. What kind of baby do you want? I'll give you any gender.
---
My bro used to open portals to darnasus while waiting for AV gates to open lol I think during tbc when they had the food and water summoning table
---
Thank you very much, I love your site! :)
---
This wiki says that only the cities will auto flag you.  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/PvP\_flag](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag) 
---
It does say that on a PvP server, the two low level zones nearest the city will auto flag you for pvp.
---
I do a lot actually, and I always hate staring at the subtitles instead of enjoying the cinematography. I do it in Spanish to keep my ears sharp - as a way to double check what I think I heard, basically. But I enjoy the programming much more when I can just dive into the visuals
---
Is that true? I only raided casually
---
You can still do world pvp raids on pve servers. Show up with a group in hillsbrad, for example, and start smashing things and pretty soon the other faction will arrive for a fight
---
Only problem is pre 1.12 av heavily favored alliance, 1.12 made it more balanced
---
Flying removed the danger of traveling throughout the world.  It made you disconnected from the zones you flew through.  It also allowed you to afk in any zone at 1000feet safely.  It was the first break from immersion in the game.
---
The people who can manage to stay up for 18~ hours a day should be able to hit 60 in about a week.  
---
Average player is likely still going to take around 2.5 months I bet (maybe longer?).
---
I know BC... Maybe it was in pre BC patch stonard portal was there. It's been to long can't recall
---
I agree. I have watched the entire show and I love it so much! But that is one thing that annoys me quite a bit.
---
You're delusional, but it was nice talking to you my friend
---
Fuck AV, bring me Azshara Crater!
---
I dont know if I agree with your last sentence, I was merely giving my thoughts on the classes, I'd personally like a little tweak, I never said you all had to agree. This is more of a informative post because not only am I speaking of experience with the two classes mentioned I'm getting feed back from you guys (or girls) about counters and your opinions.
---
So you complain that the ‚Äûgame for casuals‚Äú isn‚Äòt casual friendly enough?
---
I am making a rogue to. Ganking noobs. Night elf rouge baby
---
&gt; i have 5 kids to feed  
---
Maybe you should be feeding them instead of playing WoW.
---
I have 4 kids to feed. The 4 other ppl in my group that I‚Äôm healing. You‚Äôre welcome kids  &lt;3
---
A lot of people probably envy you for experiencing your first time.
---
That is a cool idea! You'll need quite some storage space to do this, though...
---
It was VC on Shadowmoon too
---
There‚Äôs also a decent chance that people wanted to roll something other than what will be their main on release, to keep it fresh.
---
surveys from classic forums, once all the noobs get involved the hunter population will sky rocket like it was in vanilla
---
Have fun in BFA.
---
Get a set of Judgement gear or another offensive spellpower set.
---
You're complaining about visual upgrades... to a game that's 15 years old..
---
Troll Warrior is super nice actually. 
---
I love stacking spirit gear, which works in tandem with the regeneration racial, and then popping a Trolls Blood Elixir.  
---
You virtually have no downtime when combined with Hamstring kiting, it's satisfying and you feel efficient.
---
Offtopic but i just can't to see all these Kungen wannabs fail miserably at tanking and then just rage quitting the game.
---
I mean come one..warrior is one of the shittiest levelers in vanilla and tanking is actually challenging given that you dont have plethora of insta aggro spell bullshittery added later on.
---
The "hai gusy i never played vanilla or warrior tank but i enjoy leading and plan on leading raid of 39 hardcore people who studied vanilla down to the last detail as comoletely new player" posts are also very promising ;)
---
Anyway as for grinding..you want a class that has great aoe potential or really good,fast and efficient single target kikl potential.
---
That's hunters and mages (and some joke specs like prot paladin).
---
Just play BFA then, why would you want to play classic given what you just said in your post ... That's why modern wow exists.
---
You can never full set in tier as resto. You always need to wear 3 T2 and then mix and match until Naxx. Even with Naxx loot you still keep 3pc T2.
---
Obviously go for troll.
---
Eh, I'd disagree. You still had multiple people contesting for gathering nodes, daily areas, WPvP objectives and people had to travel the zones on foot until you were level 70 anyway. I sort of agree with the AFK point but people have actually killed me when I afked in the air at the maximum possible height. Still seems like a minor thing to remove something as crucial as flying in Outlands
---
It‚Äôs because your title itself says you‚Äôre depressed over picking a fucking WoW class, doesn‚Äôt take a therapist to know your mental state is fucky if you feel that way
---
What do you think retail is for?
---
I never liked unregistered hypercam 2 because to me, the "unregistered" screamed "cheap ass"... not that the fraps logo was any better though :D
---
I would love if they improved all the graphics and models. It does nothing to change the mechanics and gameplay systems while allowing us to utilize our waaaay better PC‚Äôs and let the game look better.
---
Well, in a way you're pointing out the problem. You "ran into people because of dailies/WPvP events" rather than organic interactions within the world. Blizzard had to design around the side effects of flying and in doing to made it more artificial.
---
Dailies, another system people have issues with (this post) being used to "fix" the side effects of flying is the issue.
---
Dailies are bad because they make your playtime less organic. If you have 5 hours a night to play, you'll progress towards a goal that involves dailies at the same speed as someone with one hour a night to play. If you only binge play on the weekend, you'll progress 2/7ths as fast as the guy who logs in to do their dailies every day. Time (that you can schedule, plan, and execute on your own terms) is no longer the resource spent for progress, individual days are. And missing a day sets you one day behind someone else eternally.
---
That is what I personally hate about dailies. So saying flying doesn't lessen the amount of people you see in the world because dailies push players into the same spaces is technically true, but is also precisely the problem.
---
(Aside; WPvP events were alright from what I remember, but even back then people complained that it felt too inorganic.)
---
Outjerked again
---
That's what BFA is for, just level another character
---
[oh boy this again] (https://imgur.com/a/X0ruspR)
---
When did they add retail water?  I played in the last stress test and it was original water.
---
Does this sound like a good plan for my mage?
---
Level skinning/herbalism while leveling, selling all skinning stuff and banking herbs. Then, switch skinning to alchemy once I'm 60.
---
At that point I'm uncertain whether or not I should switch out herbalism for tailoring or enchanting or just stick with herb? Is buying herbs off AH affordable once my alchemy is maxed?
---
You're safe unless you enter an enemy city or get attacked by an enemy npc that auto flags you. Iirc, the guards at the zep towers in UC flag you when they target you. Entering tirisfal won't flag you, but entering UC will flag you.
---
Kotaku is trash, sampling reddit is not journalism and Nathan Grayson shagged Zoe Quinn for a positive review of her shitty game.
---
Entitled people like you are what ruin games today.
---
You already got your game. Go play BFA.
---
&gt; thank you guys for tuna-ing in  
---
No, guys, really. Watch the video. First 30 second. You won't regret this.
---
I'm good on not getting a beta code so I don't have to restart after launch. The beta will be wiped.
---
If they don't upgrade the game's engine, most modern computers probably won't be able to run a game as old as classic. This is one of the few changes I'd be ok with
---
Lol, someone hasn't been playing games very long if you think crybabies are new to the gaming scene. Gamers have always been little pissbabies. They cry and ragequit in Vanilla, and people will do the same in Classic.
---
Hunters running the 21marks/30surv spec won't be using their whole tier sets.
---
Back in the day I used to beat marks spec hunter that were wearing T1/T2 easy on the damage meter and I could CC and kite like a boss!
---
Today it was being discussed that in beta every rebuff of battle shout on hunter pets applying threat, this may be a bug, if not hunters will ensure threat
---
MC wont be out for months
---
Wow tokens
---
No achievements
---
Rofl, what is this?
---
On a developed server with lots of 60s leveling alts and shit, sure. On a new server where almost no one will buy materials? Not a great advice.
---
Gotta keep that shit in your bank!
---
Not sure if it's against subreddit rules or not, but my Horde raiding-focused guild on a to be determined PvP server is open to all interested. Message me if you'd like details.
---
Laughs in EU.
---
Whew. I thought there was an emote I never knew about, thank ya
---
I completely agree on everything you just said about the dailies but I can't see them re-designing the entire game(not just daily areas but the maps, in general, were designed for flying) when it was so successful in the past just because some people despise flying.
---
Roll Hunter. Like most people who are going to play the game, you most likely won't do Naxx so your worries about scaling won't matter. And even if you end up in a Naxx guild, every raid needs Tranq Shots.
---
Was that vanilla?
---
Troll, mon. You get tusks, say no to shoes, and have a very relatable posture. Trolls look awesome in plate armor, too. You know you want to be a troll.
---
If you'd waited a bit longer you might have seen Yellow and Polkadot porting in....
---
Torn between paladin, warrior and warlock. 
---
Leaning towards warrior though with gnome as race, but unsure. Plan to do mining and enchanting to start farming arcanite bars at max level, then level blacksmithing on an alt. 
---
Gotta get dat arcanite reaper bay bee.
---
Human, Dwarf and nightelf are all appealing too, but I dunno.
---
Nope. Pvp ranks give titles tho
---
Did i overread  personal opinion on that article or any kind of rating? It was just a recap of what happened üßê
---
This game was never made to be fast. Everything there takes time. You can have 5 spergy kids and still play the game. As for "walking"... befriend some mages and warlocks. There are many ways to save time. Many "shortcuts" to take. But with your personality, well... I wouldn't be surprised, if people in game just left you to walk, lul.
---
2edgy4me
---
Oh I see, we can‚Äôt understand that people started playing in post-Dire Maul.
---
nice bait
---
PvE servers are a trap. Don't do it
---
Being the WorldFirst Kill and seeing the instance WAS cleared before TBC yeah... it was vanilla xD
---
If I rush a bit and make money early, I should be able to level smithing for dirt cheap as there probably will be tons of it for almost free on AH. Thanks mate
---
Horde because you can pick between races that actually look different instead of fat human, small human, purple human and human. Also Org is just a way better capital city imo.
---
Exactly, I love the look
---
Just roll a caster and pick female. The braids are magical.
---
No you just need an account and a sub. That will get you access to Classic and everything up to and including Legion, although that will be on a separate client.
---
I'm watching the video just to spite the other angsty commenters.  Also not going to answer the question if they work or not. Muahhaha
---
Dont timelock me bro! If I want to grind nonstop for 2 weeks to get wintersaber and timbermaw let me
---
If be happy to support that man. So many people over the years have benifited from his expertise.
---
There's a place for the "non-toxic" redditors like you. It's called r/classicwowplus :)
---
where are the PC Gamer or Game Informer articles?
---
Well, there are graphic options for this. You don't have to go full foliage :V
---
Nope, but someone will probably make an addon for it.
---
Personally, I dont like achievements. Its up there with lfr imo.
---
We need a strong, actionable plan to deal with the dad gamer crisis. Dont need people leaving bgs because their wifes son kicked a hole in the wall or asking their wife for permission to auto attack every dungeon
---
Don't forget about Transmogs and selfie cams!
---
You're comparing a very niche market, private servers, to one of the most hyped blizzard releases. It's going to  be flooded
---
AFAIK achievements didn‚Äôt come till Wrath
---
not to mention they aren‚Äôt giving away beta keys anyway you literally get selected or you don‚Äôt there are no keys
---
I thought you could toggle it on/off, but I'm not quite sure.
---
Divine Might is equally useless and you should be trying to priotize int for more spellcasts over strength. Neither 10% int or 10% str is useful, but if you even come close to getting an extra spell out of your mana bar, Int is better.  It's incredibly rare for Divine Might to result in more than 2 or 3 dps.
---
i did not see that you said that was what you were selling it for in BC, my mistake
---
i did buy it at $20/1000g in vanilla though, so that was definitely the going price at least for my server, which was one of the largest
---
Haha, I am glad I did not :D
---
Would have felt bad to meet Bob immediately after finally getting to level 60 :)
---
$15 dorra a month
---
Getting exalted with the different factions is quite an achievement. I think there's something special for all reputation exalted. It takes a couples years I think.
---
Could just be an option you check or uncheck for character models, you know?
---
The draw to leveling enchanting is DEing your leveling gear that you would otherwise sell.  There's a YT called something like Skarm Tank where he talks about it.
---
No holy resist and the fact that smite can crit (while swp and flay can't) plus the spell power coefficient being high means you get a lot more out of your gear. Smite is real.
---
Wow there is actually selfie cams in retail.... Had to Google it. What a sorry state that game is in.
---
Redoubt is one of the best defensive talents in the game, that's why. It's proccing on spellbatched sitcrit abuse and can have 100% uptime.
---
I like your idea, that flying mounts would have stamina meter / that you could only go air from flight masters. I have been bouncing some ideas in my head for my own imaginary MMO and I've had similar ideas. Flying should feel majestic and epic, but after TBC it was made so mundane. At least in TBC some people still had only the basic flying speed, which made the epic flying speed feel more special.
---
Stormwind is an American city grid like LA, Orgrimmar is a European web city like Vienna.
---
 Some like one and not the other.
---
You know you simply can press the classic settings button... if you don‚Äòt wanna see the updated graphics, go ahead and shit them down... ignorant idiot... complaining about something there is a individul solution for every player. I‚Äòd say you are  solid 5/7 murican üëçüèª
---
But either way it's never going to be 100% authentic to classic because of the Legion client just being different to classic and they will probably never get it completely right, in the blizzcon panel they talked about how difficult it was for them to even get lightning somewhat correct and all the issues they had.
---
Hunter any tier ;) amazing work :D
---
Night elves give you the ability to be the first to engage in any fight as a Hunter, as well as the ability to avoid most fights that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. That alone will save you hours of corpse running. A dwarf wouldn't be able to survive a wave of enemies coming towards them, a nelf could just go off to the side and stealth.
---
But that is the thing; if we start tweaking just a little, then it's no longer classic/vanilla. Some classes are better than others for different situations. SL Warlock annihilates in 1vs1 situations, while Shaman is probably very useful in groups.
---
Unless it's been patched out, you're wrong on the sit macro stuff. The private server bug is gone, but you can spell batch the damage and take a crit seated, and batch it up so you take the crit standing up, which procs the effect.
---
Being able to use the gear I get from pve in pvp and vice versa. No stupid stats like resilience
---
Worth noting warriors get more hp regen from Spirit than any other class.
---
I liked achievements back when they actually showed that you accomplished something. Sorta like how Halo Reach had an achievement for beating the campaign solo and on Legendary.
---
Exactly. I'm messing around on a paly on a private server now because I'd never actually do a paly to 60. Just not my style.
---
so it does not work... damn that sucks
---
I haven't played wow since legion, but dailies we're not the best way to make money at that point. I'm not saying it has never been that's way, but if it's just the monetary aspect you can craft/gather, run dungeons for drops, or focus any other way of making money. Even if dailies provide the quickest way to get money I find it hard to believe it supplies even 50% of someone's  income.
---
I understand that. Yes, shp are basically killing machines, warlocks are bad, but they are playable at least. If you strive so much to counter those classes, play paladin.  With aura, enchant cloak and full T2 set, you will have approx 130 shadow resistance. As shaman, dont worry so much, majority of people will play holy priests anyway and not many warlocks are alliance since they are easily countered by overpopulated undeads on horde side
---
Just play retail and give your opinions there, and they will listen to you more there than on vanilla, because we wanted vanilla and got it, no changes is gonna be made. Play another class if you feel like it is a deal breaker that you are loosing towards 2 classes.
---
Zip it you cotton headed ninny muggins
---
When buying wow you buy the base game (all expansions expect the last one) AND the latest separate. So theoretically you will already have Classic through the base game. That is why you only will need an active subscription to play Classic. Not sure how much the base game goes for these days tho...
---
Remember you cant sell anything at the start because, 1. No one has gold. And 2. Everyone is out leveling not playing the ah.
---
In this subreddit someone posted they are going to rush to get the lvl5 wands on the ah. Literally no one on the server will have gold to buy them.
---
I‚Äôd be down for this. I‚Äôd like a hardcore server where if you die you‚Äôre done.
---
Damnit Kyle...
---
I'd have forgotten about this! Thanks! 
---
I'll be paying this a visit for sure in classic
---
1 of the guides was from Burning Crusade. You make a lot of assumptions. Whoops!
---
Yea, I eventually got a bigger screen and I could not believe I played like this for years :)
---
Priest here, down for UBRS always.
---
wtf did you just assume his species
---
Except there kind of wasn't an Internet for old people to use before leetspeak was around. That was it.
---
You wanna stack Agility, Stam, Int and then Strength. 
---
Agility to keep Flurry up as often as possible, which means more frequent Windfurys, more DPS and more burst because your WF procs will crit more often. Agility also gives you some armor and Dodge.
---
Stam because you want to survive an encounter without having to heal, in order to save Mana.
---
Intellect mainly for totems and shocks.
---
Strength is overrated at lower levels because you already have +10/20/30 etc. from your totem.
---
Having a shield is super important if you want to have a smooth experience leveling. You can reach 35-40% mitigation if your stuff is up to be date, versus 20% if you're using a 2-h.
---
A fast weapon under 2 sec is recommended, preferably 1,5 sec or so. Rockbiter for low armor targets and then Flametongue for high armor targets. From 30 and onwards you use Windfury.
---
Most will advice against WF but those people never go for Agility, so they don't know how effective it is.
---
Do you happen to have a video tutorial of this? Or a google search phrase I can use to find a video?
---
Warrior if you are tanking. even fury warriors get this and can wear it when tanking.
---
Rogue wears all the tier sometimes only 5set. 
---
Hunter wears the shit out of t1/2/3, t2.5 is for pvp. 
---
Shaman can wear tier with set bonuses. 
---
Priest wears t2
---
And that's about it. The others maybe have a couple of pieces they can wear but nothing much. I think pretty much everyone can use their t3.
---
Calling all Jan Michael Vincents, calling all Jan Michael Vincents!! We need 1 Jan Michael vincent to quadrant c, we need TWO Jan Michael vincents to quadrant E.
---
In a world with 8 Jan Michael vincents and 16 quadrants, he can't be in two quadrants at once.
---
This JANuary, get ready to Michael down your vincents.
---
Can't wait for all the kids discovering ret pally is not viable. All the nerf and boost post. It will be so funny how they will change their mind when they discover what this game is really about. A big grind.
---
vanillafriends.com in action, folks.
---
that vid sucks balls
---
Looks like you cared enough to post about it
---
j-just play with the switch kyle
---
imagine this actually qualifies as journalism in 2019
---
Care to explain what this screenshot shows?
---
Crying and rage quitting, yes. You are 100% correct. DEMANDING changes to the point that the devs actually cave in and make changes? This is news to the gaming scene. Do you deny my claim?
---
Delete all of that bollocks and go with trance.  Pendulum radio if you're not sure where to start.
---
I would start with 11 holy, but wouldn't take divine might, I'd put those 5 in Spiritual Focus. With Focus you can swap sanctuary aura and cast self heals with a minimized chance for interuption. 
---
If you always want access to tanking, stay with the 11 holy start and build into prot, but if you want to maximize dps, respec deep prot for 5/5 reckoning at 35. You can learn the spellbatched sitcrit method and do insane damage with reck. Without conse, your tanking kind of blows, so take that into consideration.
---
This is a lowkey throwback to the days of internet girls.
---
I‚Äôll have to see if I can find that particular episode of the podcast. Kind of related, I would love it if the classic team made an infographic of fun/unique statistics like that from vanilla before classic launches.
---
Because the description has anything to do with what I asked
---
Complain somewhere else
---
50$
---
Not worried myself. I will play priest as that is my favorite class.
---
Lol when has anyone ever said priests are the best and most important healers?
---
Wrong kind of troll! :D
---
Ye read some things about shadowing too. In Vanilla the shadows were just drawn on the ground. No matter where the sun was, the shadows were always at the exact same spot :p Dunno if they just have redrawn the shadows or if they are changing with the course of the sun.
---
Seems like a terminator reference.
---
He should be on the list so we can go play on his server and chill out with him.
---
You will learn very quickly this game can never have enough tanks and healers.
---
Especially in classic it‚Äôs needed much more.
---
Also a lot of people will ‚Äútry‚Äù tanking I feel as a warrior but not get to 60.
---
Primarily because levelling as a warrior is the hardest class to level as, and no reason to level as a Prot warrior, but to respec at a higher level to Prot from Fury most likely, which costs 50G which is a good amount of gold for classic.
---
Don't don't have to buy the standard edition? It's 50$
---
I'd rather have a daily quest to kill 10 furbolgs a day then just be told 'go kill hundreds of them and you'll get your rep eventually'.
---
F R E S H
---
Warriors will be most played, they always are. You have to understand position of this sub on the autism spectrum is much further than the average person. It‚Äôll likely be warrior &gt; shaman/pally &gt; rogue &gt; hunter/mage &gt; priest &gt; warlock
---
What if I bought the game in 2004!
---
That's a little addon called "The Combat Log"
---
boomers man
---
Here's the thing, classic wow is meant to be a huge time sink type of game.
---
If you're not able to play time sink types of games, then classic wow is not right for you. Retail wow on the other had sounds right up your alley.
---
Leveling to 60 in 7 days and beating Rag? Lol what?
---
I dont think the shitty 12 year old scrubs that watch streamers are carrying anybody.
---
In my opinion, [tier 5](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/a8/b4/31a8b469b4804d41d635ac9bb00740df.jpg) is the best looking tier set to ever be made in WoW.
---
I don't care about Beta, but seriously, fuck streamers.
---
An argument can be made for the new layering system and overall increased general knowledge as huge boosters to the in-game economy early on - which weren‚Äôt really a thing in Vanilla mind you.
---
d2 is trash by the time it's released. You can pug MC, BWL, ZG, and AQ20 by the time d2 is out.
---
Huh, maybe I‚Äôm crazy
---
&gt;Take one for the team and fill the role they need, just like the 39 other people in your raid are doing.
---
Someone playing a role they want to play isn't 'taking one for the team'. Someone being forced to play a role they don't want to play so they can play a role they want to play during farm absolutely is. And that's a great way to get burnt out on the game.
---
I want in the beta so I can become a streamer.
---
Why do we hate streamers?
---
 when you remember the first team wipe on ragnaros
---
Warriors have always been the most played class, but most people want to do big damage so DPS is always easy to find. Even warriors and priests get sick of being pigeonholed as tank/heals so they spec dps.
---
Yes sir. They have an in depth plan to get 40 people to 60 within 4 days IRL and then some basic gearing / quintessence quest. Killing Rag just before reset.
---
Yes, absolutely. Being able to play multiple specs and multiple classes is a significant improvement over having multiple specs that are irrelevant for PvE.
---
One of them no.  But a legion of them?  Possible.
---
Daily quests create retention and are proven to be very appealing and instantly attract and keep players... for a short time. This is why every game does it. But this is also why they have poor LONG TERM retention, because the joy of achieving so many short term goals feel good and give you a dopamine rush, in the long term you lose that rush and it becomes stress to try and log in and keep up when you would rather do other stuff, even if it's in the game itself.
---
This is why people played older games for longer. There was actually more to do because everything took 10x longer and when you finally did get the reward, it was a much better dopamine rush that was worth the longer wait and struggle to get. 
---
That being said, that is how we used to be as gamers. It may not just be developers, but also us that have changed over the years. Maybe we prefer a few months of gameplay and then fucking off to new games now. Maybe Classic will just be a 1-2 month gameplay session for most people and we drop it too. It will be very interesting to see if this holds up or if we as gamers have just changed too much. Obviously some people will still like it and stay, I'm just talking about the general population. It may also be completely unappealing mechanically to people that never experienced this type of gameplay, and only those of us who are used to it originally will enjoy it.
---
I've heard otherwise but hope you're the one right.
---
Well, I see it as pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking, myself.  I would just personally adore the chance to see a reimagined BC and onwards without flying, dailies, or arena. I stopped playing in BC, and those were the reasons why.
---
They each fundamentally changed the way the game was designed, and the effects weren't immediately noticeable.  I feel that those things are as much of a departure from the "soul" of Classic as LFR, CRZ, and phasing.
---
And now you have only 60 second left...
---
Jealousy.
---
I mean, a little hyperbole, but a bunch of oldschool people who are streaming now are talking up how everyone wanted a priest and how warriors are drastically the best at tanking because of their kit. 
---
It feels like thats a narrative thats gonna get us a billion warriors/priests
---
Proof is that's how its worked for years. Lol. You go into an enemy zone and you can be killed. Contested zones, you have to flag. Done.
---
Ima go with hunters being the most populated
---
I'd be fine with that. No one wants to pay for Classic because it's the same game, but if they actually try to change and improve future... past... expacks, I'd be willing to dump $20 or so in there since they will be reusing a lot of assets and story but still putting in work. It definitely wouldn't be able to pull in $40+ though.
---
It does affect the retail economy thoe.
---
Name certainly doesn't check out. If you want to do Stratholme in Classic, you can take a flight point or ride, that's the choices. If your group will summon your lazy ass, great. But don't expect modern-WoW quality of life changes in Classic; they won't be there.
---
I don't have the eternal hours of my youth to sink into the game anymore either, and I'm going in with that in mind. I'm just going to play the game and have fun. If Classic WoW is not the game you want to play, you're in the wrong subreddit, friend. Even if the "no changes" crowd grinds their teeth with the thought of things like loot trading and such, or goes overboard, the game isn't going to be as forgiving as modern WoW. "Easier than 2004 EverQuest?" Sure. "As easy as 2019 MMOs?" No. That's not what they're making, that's not what most people want.
---
I can't wait until school is back in session.
---
You can actually stop the roulette wheel by mousing over the top edges of the portal animation.
---
Then you're good unto and including Legion. And Classic ofc.
---
Sounds like you want to play BFA then. It‚Äôs for casuals. Incredibly balanced, easy rotations and easier to que for dungeons and etc.
---
Classic is actually for more hardcore people as it is generally harder, for example look at tanking
---
Tanking in bfa = no real risk, incredibly easy to taunt as any tank, won‚Äôt lose the taunt either and don‚Äôt have to try to keep it even, just hit the literal button that says ‚Äútaunt‚Äù and everything is and will be taunted even if you do no dps.
---
Tanking in classic= dps have to monitor their threat levels, the tank has to monitor their threat levels and have specific moves to boost up threat and shouldn‚Äôt aoe tank or can‚Äôt without it being very hard or lose taunt incredibly fast
---
What many people in here forgot to mention is that r14 pushes are coordinated efforts.
---
It isn't just something you get by nolifing alone - you get it by knowing the right people, getting into the right groups, dodging like a motherfucker, coordinating who gets how much honor and so on.
---
Mr. streamer isn't going to get his r14 unless the other rankers want him to.
---
Do you still have your account?
---
I've never played Vanilla and lately I've been thinking a lot about what features I could have liked to see added to the game, even if not strictly Vanilla.
---
I thought about achivements, personally I like them, but I finally see that there are many downsides. I thought about keeping mounts like in Wotlk, but I'm not too sure about that either at this point. Daily quests same thing, I agree that they might be detrimental to the game.
---
There are still some QoL I think I would like to see implemented (and I'm really open to find out I'm wrong), even if not "true vanilla", but I guess it's pretty hard to find a good balance (I mean, I've heard people ask for low res and forced lag just to better emulate the old experience).
---
At least make it spliff :(
---
Many thanks!
---
Yeah, I only trust loot-council if the whole guild can see (but not modify) the spreadsheets the officers are using to track people's gear.
---
World PvP!!! Going to roll a rogue and troll and grief the absolute fuck out of Alliance scum!!! 
---
Victory for Sylvanas!!
---
If you can sealtwist correctly and carry NF, you're more than capable of pugging well past MC.
---
It depends on your build. ENH can be built as a melee damage build or a spellblade build, and each has a different stat priority. MC overall has choice pieces that are BiS for a lot of classes for a long time, I would assume the same is true for Shaman. Classic is more of a RPG than new versions, you need to figure a build out and figure out what you need to make it work, there is no 'shaman gear' really there is gear with stats on it that interact with your class.
---
There is no standard edition anymore. A sub gets you everything pre-BFA.
---
Okay, boohoo 2 classes. I'm more worried that everyone will jump on a band wagon and everyone who's trying to enjoy the game will just get smacked because warlocks and priests everywhere, this is just as much our game as it is "your game" everyone is allowed a voice and I'm voicing my opinions. Retail is shit and playing this game franchise since child hood I'm allowed to speak about it
---
The Wiki is saying that things like Elwynn Forest are considered Neutral territory and thus you would have to flag yourself for them. It makes little to no sense how Elwynn Forest would be Neutral but thats what the Wiki says
---
That'd be very hard to do in WoW but would be interesting to do, definitely have to be a PvE server - maybe you loose all your gear and items?
---
Frost Oil on your weapon, I think even a judgement can proc the slow effect. 
---
Im not sure but it might scale with Spell power as well.
---
Keep a stack on you.
---
A lot of people will play the popular classes. A lot of people will suck. A lot of people will quit after a month or two. 
---
Play what you like and play it well. People will recognize and remember the good players.
---
Ty for info i really appreciate it. Ill probably lvl another shaman to test different feels :D
---
Horde here. We used to call deadmines dm too and we farmed it for twink gear.
---
Not having a candle is not joke, you heartless‚Ä¶
---
nope just make an account, pay for the sub, download the game and you are good to go
---
Yeah, I agree. But if the spells and talents are the same isnt that still "Vailla"? If you take 4% out of a talent that give you a 14% damage increase (this is an example) it doesnt really seem that different.
---
With a large group of seasoned adventurers, who travelled the whole world, overcoming every obstacle and who ventured into the deeps of the doomed Blackrock mountain itself, exploring the ancient fallen dwarven city and lived to tell the tale. 
---
Every single one is an example of the best warriors on whole of Azeroth, who spent their time getting an old wisdom and equipping with magic fire-resistant artefacts and preparing to face the fire lord himself. They slayed all his henchmen, descended to the very core of the mountain, uncovering old armour with magic powers that grant an ability to withstand a fire and the heat of the unimaginable levels inside the mountain core.
---
Equipped with this, preparing the journey for a long time, these adventurers chose the best, the most bold, the most fierce warrior among themselves, the one who stood against an Emperor and lived, who spent his lifetime preparing for this challenge. They clad him into an ancient, enchanted armour, they protected him with words of magic, drawing from the Light itself, the paladins blessed him with the Light's protection against elements and the priests cast the holy power to keep him from harm.
---
He lead, unbreaking, without fear, his group into the core, awakened the evil lying within, awakening Ragnaros the Firelord himself and challenged him. While he was withstanding the immense heat and defending the swings of a giant fiery hammer bigger than him with his shield, the fellow adventurers tried to douse the fire of the firelord from afar, as they did his lieutenants and the runes of Molten Core. A band of the most powerful mages drew from the deeps of their skill, magical powers and long years of training, to cast the most potent frost magic Azeroth has ever seen. In the end, after tiresome fight and large sacrifices, they managed to freeze almost the literal hell and snuffed the fiery life from the firelord and banished him back to the firelands and thus saved the mortal world of Azeroth from the threat the Dark Irons brought upon it.
---
TL:DR: By having someone with incredibly high, magic-induced fire-resistant magick'd armour and a bunch of frost mages freezing the fire inside Ragnaros.
---
Mean.
---
There's nothing special about priests. Shamans, Pallies and Druids do plenty of things priests can't and outshine them as support in some situations.  
---
Yes there will be a ton of warriors. They are fun to play, are super powerful and have 3 viable trees at lvl 60. There still won't be enough tanks though and melee dps is interchangeable so there's no such thing as too many warriors. Some class has to be the most popular obviously, it might as well be warriors, at least some of them will tank.
---
As a counterpoint, I've also leveled two and find spirit to be pretty handy in remaining "mana neutral" without having to drink.
---
Definitely try both methods.
---
There are many private servers thriving right now due to the classic hype. The only i currently play on peaked at 15k the other day. Im not sure how blizz will handle the launch or how flooded it will be without sharding. Deff will be interesting.
---
This game is about levelling, social community, and creating a server unique world within the perimeters of WoW.
---
Turns out, this game can be whatever you want.
---
Back when TBC first came out a mutual friend of ours decided he wanted to play WoW so I RaF‚Äôd him. He was getting bored of the low level zones and he wanted to roll with the big dogs and kept begging us to let him join us in Outland. So we were feeling a little devilish and told him he has to delete his HS and we can summon him. So he did, spawned right next to the wandering Elite and got obliterated. He hung up on us and spent the next 5 hours corpse running back to his starting zone then logged. The next day we call him and he said at first he was pissed but then on his journey he saw so much of the world and made friends with some other people who helped him get back home - gave him some gold and pointers, and he thanked us for the experience. Really made him enjoy the leveling process after that. 
---
God I miss those days lol.
---
When you have the option to go Horde, you should always go Horde.
---
Just embrace all these Vanilla shenanigans and try and have fun. Vanilla is an unbalanced unfair mess and it's, it's , just , wonderful!
---
No, the sub gets you everything bedsides the latest xpac, that you have to pay for. When the NEW xpac comes out, then BFA will be included in the sub as well. That is retail WoWs model.
---
The way they work on expansions they are probably already working on the next one after BFA so no.
---
Most likely what will happen BFA and after will be tailored towards people that don't like playing MMORPGs and Classic will be for MMORPG players.
---
bait
---
Hunter is what I played from Vanilla - WotLK, a lot of people will play it as it‚Äôs incredibly easy to be good. (Especially in World PvP)
---
The only problem is they are very hard to master and be great at, considering at high levels how much people will be trying to take advantage of the ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù and how as a hunter you will need to be incredibly cautious of that and know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
So I think personally it‚Äôll have the same affect as warrior, a lot of people trying it, but not a lot of people getting to or staying at 60.
---
Another thing I could see is some new players that like for example started in mists - bfa and try hunter in classic could not enjoy the whole ‚Äúfeeding the pet‚Äù and looking at its mood.
---
12 years old video comments ü§£
---
I usually make a decent sum of money selling the first shoulders you can get. People are willing to pay multiple times what they vendor for usually. And there are some twink ones that are worth a a gold sometimes, like the mail ones.
---
It doesn't cost 50g.
---
It starts at 1g, and goes up in small increments until settling at 50 permanently.
---
You can also tank stuff like strat/scholo/UBRS just fine as fury.
---
this game is about the purplez
---
These are great! Keep up the good work  
---
Have you considered giving love to the dungeon sets?? Could be fun.
---
Thought the same thing. If I did get a beta key i wouldn't be able to help myself from playing it all the time and I feel I would ruin the experience for me. I paid for one month of wow and I managed to get into a stress test so I'm happy. I wont be paying for any more months until classic comes out.
---
Bro I might - keep posting on here looking for people.  I have a friend who I want to play with but he wants to go alliance :(  I‚Äôm a Tauren player at heart.
---
YES. I quit at the end of Wrath for exactly that reason! I felt that grinding dailies was a job. I had to do them to have enough gold.
---
I already had a job making real money, I felt like an absolute TOOL for playing a Job Simulator.
---
Came back for Cata, left Retail for good within a month.
---
It'll probably be silver, but it still might be hard to pay for at lvl 5.
---
&gt;Flying in Azeroth being frowned upon and wanting to be removed is completely understandable but in any expansion area, WoTLK included, with the forced dailies/objectives you have to do, I just can't see people wanting flying removed.
---
But they also want dailies removed. The people who dislike flying aren't a fan of that and badge gear either. They want the old school kill x to get y drop and the freedom from daily requirements. It's totally fine to disagree and like these things. I was a huge fan of Wrath despite it having these things, but do I think it would be a better expack without them? Honestly, yes.
---
It also depends on your view of PvP. If you play on PvE servers, then it wouldn't matter to you. But flying absolutely reduces the amount of world PvP you get into on PvP servers. You can argue you still get into enough PvP fights, and it may be enough for you, but other people feel differently.
---
Also if benediction turned up in one of these I wouldnt even be mad or use it as a wallpaper.
---
Same! I'm afraid of hitting any type of leveling burnout before the actual release. I'm okay with waiting. I am going to try to do my best to avoid streamer servers although.
---
To you that's the best thing. Not every one is the same my dude. Personally I hate the thought of wasting time doing things that I didn't really need to do. I'll be going the most efficient way however that includes leveling my professions along the way (as it's more efficient to do so)
---
No. We‚Äôre talking about a videogame here. Not socioeconomic statuses.
---
Thats why i love the recall spell on shaman, 15min hearthstone in vanilla :D
---
Sorry I never respecced back then. That‚Äôs just what I saw around here price wise.
---
And you can tank many things just fine as Fury, but when op said lots of tanks I assumed they wouldn‚Äôt be an off tank.
---
Is that my boy Pat??
---
It's not new to the game scene. Users simply have more direct contact with Devs due to social media these days. There really is no 'spoon feeding' when the changes are ones the Devs think up, copy from an add-on, copy from another game, or do to encourage more people to buy their product.
---
Most
---
It would be interesting but I can't see it ever happening because of the massive undertaking that would be required to rework all of the zones. That's why I don't get why people advocate for it to be removed, it's one thing to want to experience it but another to advocate for its removal, that's the part I don't understand. 
---
Also, phasing, CRZ, DF, LFR IMO were far worse than Arena/dailies/flying because they actually destroyed the original zones, and made it so you didn't even have to explore the outlands/northrend or anything. You could literally sit in a main capital and just queue up. Nothing can be worse than that.
---
I thought (TBC) Badge Gear was fine; Heroics were really difficult (IMHO, since I exclusively ranked in dungeons). But the Badge System itself was definitely the start of something Evil.
---
Even then its not permanently set at 50G. It goes down in cost per month you don't respec.
---
Rogues don't use t1 but the others, you are correct about that. T1 is PvP gear
---
true, but with the multiple servers and layering that blizz has, i wouldn't expect any single layer to be as bad as a poplar pserver launch
---
Nah, once you‚Äôre ahead of the curve you‚Äôll have zones/questing areas relatively to yourself.
---
Do you like shoes?
---
Like if kiting Teremus to stormwind wasn't already wildspread on Vanilla and private servers later on, this had nothing to do with streamers.
---
Will people stop playing because there are some multiboxers out there? No.
---
Will blizzard make a rule that stops stupid people like me from giving them $600 a month in wow subs? I doubt it. 
---
If multiboxing becomes so widespread that it‚Äôs actually causing masses of people to unsub then I could see them doing something about it. Like making it bannable to gank people while multiboxing or something.
---
wow don't badmouth my heccing doggo speak okay they're good bois.
---
Blizzard confirmed MC and Ony will be out day 1. Would be curious to your source that says otherwise.
---
lol, seriously reporting me for calling you a dimwit, good look
---
I‚Äôm actually ok with that. It creates a sense of community where you know the people on your server. 
---
3k during peak is actually a very healthy number.
---
Paladins are the "best" healers in terms of mana efficiency and buffs.
---
Priests are the most versatile healers.
---
Shamans are meh healers, but bring a fuckload of utility and indirect dps to the table.
---
Druids are innervate/gift bots and loot sponges.
---
Every one of these are valuable, but priests are just good allrounders.
---
Yes, watching daddylongdick and mommymilf RP in Goldshire really helped me appreciate WoW
---
This is clearly a pasta. Right??
---
But a resto shaman is probably the best dps of all the healers. Most shamans go 30/21 ele/resto and can do decent dps and burst. You wont be one shotting aby body but it's way better than a druid trying to cat form someone or a holy paladin trying to hammer someone down for 30 mins. Priest isnt too bad I think
---
Is this nostalgia?
---
it will also take really long time to form groups
---
I think there's a general concern with things like server firsts. I know that I would personally prefer to be on a server where it's not assumed that a streamer and their guild will be the ones to open the AQ gates. I don't want to deal with that kind of entitlement. It should be a fair playing field for all.
---
An evolving language is not some oppressor, and it isn't some slippery to barbarism. Ad naseum bragging about sanity, education, and wisdom is why you've been targeted for satire.
---
&gt;It's not going to stop me from playing, it's just got me curious for what's in store for the average player that doesn't know those tips / tricks.
---
You'll probably see them/hear about them more and learn them as you go.
---
It's definitely true that there is a lot more min/maxing to be expected - everyone already knows the final META before even rolling a char.
---
I should have honestly looked at the ui more. I never used or checked it out... but oh well.
---
Im duo leveling with healer and when they're not online ill farm for main with hunter.
---
You'll be mostly fine but the dungeon and raid builds are different.  Sap removes stealth without point in imp sap.  You can PvP in a PvE spec but it'll be significantly less good.  Rogue is no less susceptible to specialization issues as any other dps class.  
---
Inevitably, if you play long enough, you'll roll new characters for new each role you want to play.
---
Only class I can 100% guarantee there will be a lot of, is Rogues and Mages. Beyond that I wouldn't be too worried about it.

"whats wow without achievements ?"
---
big kek, nice post
---
You have no idea what you talking about
---
It will be a complete faceroll.   A large part of the difficulty of classic was putting in the work to attain the knowledge.   Now that difficulty is totally gone.  Comparing vanilla to classic is like comparing building a bridge to walking over one.   To make things worse, we will be using patch 1.12, which further trivializes the majority of early content.  
---
I am not sure why you think that would lead to more min maxing though.
---
16 hours a day for 3months, could be less, but thats what you should prepare for
---
Mage helps the most people 
---
Id get it to the most trustworthy mage
---
Truth
---
The simple truth is if that‚Äôs what you life demands then BfA is the version of WoW for you. Classic is for those of us who want the old school way of playing back. No harm intended but that is the compromise here.
---
Fuck outta here with this dumb shit. If you don't have the time to play because you have 5 kids, you probably shouldn't be playing video games.
---
Had heaps of fun throwing DoTs and changing back into a bird before I hit the ground.
---
Mage is the best for it to go to, but its such a grind it‚Äôll likely go to whoever wants it and really deserves it
---
Have you played TBC/Wrath? Dailies were necessary. It was like 80%+ of my PvP Warrior‚Äôs income. Not much else I could have done.
---
Not many, Warriors mostly. The tier gear can be pretty awesome in PvP, but its mostly just sexy gear to wear near the mailbox.

Speaking of multiboxing in bg's, l heard that autofollow was not working in the beta bg's. That was a while back. Anyone know if that was determined to be a bug or working as entended?
---
No thanks.
---
i cant believe people are falling for this shit bait
---
You're

Or a mode where players can loot your gear.
---
Dont want to fuel your rage but in all honesty - either play casual and dont give a crap or move on to another game. 
---
Back in Vanilla i was like 12-14 and i do now own a business that wont allow me to do much more than nolifeing the first week. But im fine with that. Just accept your faith and the blessing your kids are (or should be :P)
---
On the plus side magisters terrace was a great instance!
---
Yeah that's true, but the monthly decay is so slow that most people prone to respeccing stay at that point forever.
---
Ban dad gamers

Can only fit 10-15 in a bg.

Usually the one with the most influence decided. Either for himself or for someone else. Could decide on merit, greed, personal preference... There are not really any "rules" for it.
---
Valid point, however it was a direct comparison of language to language not internet to internet. Sure, L33T5P34K may be one of the first iteration of internet speak, but you have to compare it to English. "Old People" would be comparing it that way. They wouldn't care if it was the very first variation. To say old people weren't on the internet and thinking L33T5P34K was immature or something only young people used would be quite ignorant.
---
The items clarify for priest, and you need to collect a set to receive the start of the quest chain.

I got Benediction back in the day.  It felt like a class test. You proved you could raid, but could you pass the game‚Äôs test of proving you‚Äôre a worthy priest?  Took me a could of tries to pass the quest back in the day.
---
Not everyone got Benediction, and it felt like a status symbol of proving your worth as a priest character.
---
Because of my emotional attachment to Benediction back in Vanilla, I always transmog my staff to it for nostalgia. I‚Äôve never liked another weapon as much since.
---
The Isle was dope because of the PvP and the fact that you could do all of them pretty much at the same time. The design made it less of a chore, and actually quite fun. Zone design apparently is paramount.
---
Anything in particular you're looking for? That's a really open ended question.
---
You can still have tbc and not have daily quests. Just don't add them. Or flying for that matter. Or LFG in wotlk.
---
What a shit post
---
Next can we have servers where you aren‚Äôt allowed
---
The talk about warriors as hybrid misses the main reason that healing classes (hybrids) do so much less damage. Balance wise its the ability to heal that is THE cause for the tax. Healing is incredibly strong in PvP and in vanilla all specs of the healer classes can put out good healing (but not for very long). 
---
Making paladins and ferals better tanks (which for ferals comes down to itemization, paladins would need something like tbc talents too) wouldnt really upset any balance between players.
---
All hybrids are good at PvP as things are. If the damage for elemental shamen, balance druids or priests would increase they would become op as they have the mana to use for healing and the spell damage to boost it in tandem with now being able to do good damage.
---
Im not sure if I want it or not. Tanking hybrids wouldnt really be a problem but I cant see them fixing those and leaving the other as is.
---
If they were to do some alternative progression after Naxx I assume it would be a good idea to keep tweaking the classes but Im not sure I would want any of that to happen.
---
I think people are paranoid to distrust the Blizzard designers ability to produce Vanilla-esque content. Of course it would be quite doable. My biggest objection is that then the whole "museum" idea would disappear. I would say that it is nice that Blizzard makes it possible to play the old game again and they should probably keep the vanilla version available.
---
Tauren look better than orcs in most gear past phase 1, but not during
---
1.12 is the most balanced version of the game. Even all the private vanilla servers ran and still run 1.12 because of this reason.
---
Paladins and shamans are very good healers too, there's an argument to be made that druids don't bring much extra to a group compared to other healers, but someone needs to take the druid gear so... And if you just look at actual healing they do perfectly fine. 
---
As for warriors, there has never been a period in WoW history where we have been oversaturated with tanks for dungeon content, so I would not worry about that. In raids and PvP, yeah, maybe, but I don't really think that's a problem for other classes, it's only a problem if you yourself are trying to compete as a warrior.
---
There is a very low limit on the number of players you can ignore.
---
Very difficult to get the recipes. because everyone will roll on them.  They're worth several thousand gold, and people pay it, because you need them for progression, and you can make money creating them.
---
Shadowmelt is awesome, you can do cool tricks with it and nice plays, the dwarf racial is kinda boring
---
Yea you can have some fun in pvp as a balance hybrid
---
Should have used a condom.
---
I dont care
---
Hello, no im not from swiss, i just like the swiss view on privacy ;)
---
I'm not saying that they have to like flying/dailies, but I don't understand why they expect Blizzard to change every single zone when flying was massively successful in the past. Also, I disagree with the fact that flying destroyed WPvP. It may have "reduced it" but I still had plenty of battles in Outlands/Azeroth. 
---
With that being said, what "other people" feel differently? When I was playing BC/WoTLK, nobody complained about flying at all. Just because you have a select few advocating for the complete removal of flying/dailies doesn't mean I have to agree with their desire to remodel every single zone in outlands/northrend(If they ever re-release WOTLK/BC). 
---
You can't tell people to have no changes to classic and then turn around and be the very same people you criticize by advocating for Blizzard to completely change every new zone just because they believe flying/dailies ruin the game.
---
A warrior, a paladin, and a priest walk into a bar. The bartender asks, ‚ÄúLooking for more?‚Äù
---
They reply ‚ÄúYeah, just need a tank and heals then g2g‚Äù
---
zippidyy dee do da!!!! because i‚Äôm happy!! 
---
better?
---
oh didn't know BC was vanilla, as I said, good luck
---
Delete this
---
I'm not going to be trying to gouge people, but I think If I can aim around 10-15s somebody will buy. A wand is a much better investment than the majority of early skills. By reinvesting income into more linen I can try to really level tailoring, then become one of the first people to craft woollen bags.
---
Buying the mats on the AH is also worthwhile, if they're on there for a good price.  You can still easily come out ahead like that.
---
The first thing I would suggest you do, is to learn how to take a screenshot. 
---
After that, you just need to ask yourself what your priority is. If you want to level as fast as possible then you need to just ignore professions until you're level 60.
---
If you get more fun out of it go for it. I'm at least going to leveling my gather profession while leveling, and even that is gonna slow me down a lot. But its fun for me and it some extra gold.
---
You can tank anything but raids easily as non-protection. You will certainly need tank gear tho.
---
except if you choose to sell your account
---
You should share some of that plan üòä
---
This is what the devs WANT you to think. What they ACTUALLY think is this: ‚ÄúKeep them coming back for more, like drug addicts. They can hate it, but they will need to do it.
---
This is greed/laziness on the dev‚Äôs part, and they are taking advantage of people‚Äôs compulsions/completist attitudes.
---
People are cute fixing objectives like getting legendary.
---
Gonna be used every single time a rogue/druid stealth ganks someone  10 levels lower than them.
---
You can aswell play the AH market :)
---
Anyone who thinks it needed to be vc was delusional no point in changing it. DM East =/= deadmines east. I never understood why anyone was confused.
---
Fuck the kids dude. I just want to play Classic
---
Luckily for you, when you take the 9th "my kid doesn't respect me and is now rubbing shit on the walls" break, it's too much effort for us to replace you BECAUSE of the dungeon runs. So... You're welcome?
---
I need this addon.
---
In addition, it's basically the first instance for Alliance players.  Many players didn't even know about instances/portals until then.  All you knew was you had to go there to kill Van Cleef.  If you're not paying much attention, you won't even know the instance's name until you go through the portal.
---
It's dead.
---
How come most people wont make it to naxx? I cant imagine the mechanics being any harder than mythic on retail, and with private servers I would think a fair amount of people would be comfortable with mechanics / raid leading.
---
You won‚Äôt tank anything easily as warrior in classic, 
---
Fury can tank fine with the tank gear but it certainly won‚Äôt do as well as protection.
---
That‚Äôs why I recommend levelling as fury, doing dungeons as fury and etc but once at 60 or close to then re spec to Prot.
---
Tanking just generally isn‚Äôt easy in classic, and especially not as fury or arms.
---
Mind me asking why this was popular? I didn‚Äôt play until WOTLK
---
They don‚Äôt, though. How does a PvP warrior in TBC/Wrath make gold? I wasn‚Äôt FORCED into dailies; nobody put a gun to my head.... But I kind of was. When I don‚Äôt have money for repair bills or flightpaths, what do I do if not dailies?
---
honestly i think the toxicity is peaking now and until late July. Once classic gets closer and is finally released we‚Äôll all simmer down. 
---
A few weeks after release is what I‚Äôm interested in seeing. Will the community be hopeful, enthusiastic and welcoming as it was a few months ago or will it be divided and somewhat hostile like it is now.
---
What pc will I need to run this on max?
---
I had to resurrect this old account just to laugh at you. IF you have 5 kids to feed and feel like the game takes too long to play just leave and don't play.  You're a father of 5 on forums complaining about other people complaining. I feel so bad for your neglected children. You Don't even have to walk there, most of it is don by flying. Please leave and dont come back
---
It's lazy ass design and quickly became a chore. Same reason I quit.
---
That was the point of that thread.
---
You brought the streamer circle jerk into this thread. 
---
It‚Äôs funny, you are excited for people to stop talking about streamers yet you are the only one who mentioned streamers on this thread, and in doing so, created a discussion about them.
---
you make gold however you choose to make gold
---
I blame soda
---
People said VC from launch when they got the quest.  Had nothing initially to do with the instance he was in, but rather the enemy needing to be killed.
---
Hey.. I'm a dad too, from pservers and don't want changed so... !
---
I came here for this; was not disappointed.
---
Yes exactly. I look forward to building friendships through requires communication and teamwork within MMOs again.
---
Love all the old raid pics
---
Let‚Äôs actually just have a server for every person that complains about streams, it would definitely have a high enough population considering how many posts complaining everyday get posted here
---
I think blizzard needs to make a server for everyone who suggests this, force them to that server, and then just turn it into BfA forever.
---
Raptor Strike ftw
---
I think this guy was trying to be nice. Stop being such a pussy and find what you need elsewhere instead of bitch at people trying to answer your very googleable question
---
This reddit user was probably one of the druids who ganked me when I afkd in the air.
---
Not gonna happen. Play on another server if you don‚Äôt like interacting with the people on your server. What you‚Äôre suggesting is segregation and that‚Äôs how you destroy a player base
---
To be fair it's a silly assumption. Just call is dm like every other dungeon in the game since the release - and call the deadmines dm. 
---
P.s.: just becuase your server fails in logic, doesn't mean all other servers are failing with logical universal naming scheme, not exception for no reason. Literally never heard VC up until I read it here and I played retail classic and a bit of pservers.
---
Why did you re post this but make it worse.
---
Dynamic respawns on private servers are a feature, not a bug
---
In old school SWG if you managed to grind hard and long enough to become a jedi, you only had like 2 lives, and if you were revealed as a jedi you‚Äôd be hunted basically. It was super intense so something similar where once you die, you‚Äôre done for would be interesting to see
---
August 26th 6:00pm EST*
---
FIFY
---
People during vanilla called it VC almost all the way through.  Wasn't until TBC that it kind of died off, at least on the Draenor server.
---
It‚Äôs funny that you can see it empirically kinda. I realize upvotes and downvotes are pretty meaningless but 4 or 5 months ago every post on here was upvoted, even just a simple two word acknowledgement would get upvoted to around 10. Now the downvotes absolutely pour in on unpopular posts and even just neutral posts hover around 0. 
---
Wonder if the mods have any data on the ratio of downvotes now compared to a few months ago.
---
Can I have something like questie but without the location of the mobs. Just quest giver locations?
---
sure, its still gonna take long to form groups
---
I'm not into celebrity culture, but Twitch streamers are basically like those girls whose job is posting makeup videos on YouTube.  You're either interested in them or not.
---
I think you have to be level 35 to get to Artisan (aka 300 cap) in a profession. So the bank alt alchemist would be a pretty big time investment. Can you confirm? I could be wrong.
---
Yet for 2 years people labeled it VC due to the quest.  Nothing new, and it will likely still happen lol
---
Cool nice chatting with you.
---
I have to tell myself to not level 25 alts so I can actually get 60 this time
---
Imo 40+ is the point where it starts to feel very different to level warrior, simply because you get a good rage spender with Ms. Whirlwind slightly before that too, but you'll only use one of them while leveling.
---
Huh? Classic isnt an 'expac' and as I said if you use mana to deal damage you are gonna slow the run down because you need to drink after every pull.
---
If we only count "mains", I don't think so. If we count all alts and stuff, maybe, still would guess warrior or mage though. 
---
Warrior is top dps and the best/only tank. Lots of people want in on that. 
---
Mage is top ranged dps and arguably the most well-designed class in vanilla.
---
that's because you're LFR hero
---
The only reason why Pserver doesn‚Äôt burn you out is because you are coming straight from Retail. The Refreshment overwhelms the Burnout.
---
It's the effect they will have on the servers when it comes out that I see. Not so much about them for streaming beta.
---
Wow, I can't believe how many people here are so angered by people saying "VC" instead of "DM".  Bottom line is that through the vast majority of vanilla, most people referred to the forming of a group for deadmines as VC, because that was the guy they needed to kill.  
---
Had nothing to do with the instance he was in, but rather the quest.  I am sure this will still be a thing to some degree.
---
Awesome, thanks. Who would be next in line? I‚Äôd assume either lock or priest? Druid being the least helpful?
---
This shit made me LOL real hard
---
I'll chill if you relax, alright?
---
All progress made in life is irrelevant because you always end up dying at the end
---
Fuck the kids dude, I just want to experience the game I've been waiting 15 years for to play, is that too much too ask? You don't know me or my life you entitled pos
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, if you are a certain kind of gamer. Relative to the other classes, however, it is objectively bad.
---
I wouldn't want to relevel any class over again once I just did it. I'm going to wait until we can all do it together as a community.
---
You get them in ashenvale, thousand needles, stone talon.. Few places. Plus if you accidentally pull more than one a wand isn't gonna cut it.
---
you saying 24 days is fast?
---
Well before raids it was one of the places with some bis blues and also the books that gave head and leg enchants
---
1. I haven't done raid content, so I don't know.
---
2. I don't get the impression that Resto Shaman are good in PvP.  My understanding is that premades will take an elemental shaman to bring the boom because the base damage on CL is so crazy.
---
3. I've heard you basically are a healing bitch in raids, but can get geared the fuck out for other stuff because you don't share a ton of drops with other classes.  R10 is also apparently a fine rank to end at as elemental.
---
4. IDK
---
5. Ignore Mulgore if you aren't Tauren.  Strategic dying and spirit rezzing works wonders when you're doing Echo Isles quests.  Don't bother with the beach crawlers because they will be farmed out.  Wait until you've done the killing portion of the Kul Tiras chain and kill the makruras and crawlers while you gather Gnomish Tools.  If quests are impossible to complete because of overcrowding, consider killing boars in the northern part of Durotar (Elders can drop two chunks of boar meat) and you can get something like 40-50 levels of cooking just from boar meat.  Ignore WC until level 18 when you get tremor totem and DISREGARD the escort quest until you have at least a 20+ group with at least a mage and probably 23 warrior tank.  Be prepared to go to Silverpine Forest in the early-to-mid-teens as many of the quests you will have around that time in the Barrens will be difficult to complete without grouping and reducing your experience gain.  Consider waiting to go to Hillsbrad and STV when quests there become first available because IIRC Alliance players first go to those places at higher levels and they will be swarming the yeti cave between Hillsbrad and TM.  Consider grinding out SM until you get as much of the rarespawn drops from GM and the mail pieces from the rest if you think you will want to play Enhancement (you will str8 delete people from 30 to like 48).  If you think you want to go Elemental, make sure you get Hypnotic Blade from SM Library because it does not get upgraded for a long time.  Farm Maraudon for Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler.  Kill gnomes.  Lok tar ogar or w/e the fuck.
---
thats what i said yes  
---
but most people dont quit BECAUSE it creates addiction and dependence
---
But I'm a horde for life, I just dont think theres much I can do I guess. Thanks for the suggestion though, I appreciate that
---
I absolutely loved tanking in TBC and early Cata, heroics were hard and not everyone was able to do trash, let alone bosses and full runs. Talk about rewarding experience, 1 hour difficult run and all you get is blue gear. Genuinely lost it when people complained about hard Deadmines HC to the point where they nerfed it to the ground.
---
Thanks for checking that! After their comments i wasnt even sure anymore :D
---
Eh, hunters may.be populate bu my they're so average at pvp and PvE that I don't see them really being in demand in the slightest. There will always be 1-2 of them, which is enough for a 40 man raid.
---
Drop shield block.
---
Amen
---
Yeah, no, poor streamers should get priority though. They have it so rough in life already. Everyone else should really just get the fuck over it. It's not like they paid for the same product or something.
---
God bless the United States.
---
&gt;If you don't have dailies, you don't have reputation earning for different BC factions.
---
Not really? Sure they were designed with daily rep rewards in mind but you can very easily retune the factions around non-daily sources, just need to get a bit creative with it.
---
Did the reputation values change from Vanilla to TBC? Doubt it. Regardless, I‚Äôll have it by 60 in the worst case scenario. You are just being a smartass now.
---
&gt;This started out as a super fun nostalgia subreddit and quickly turned into a fucking cesspool. A lot of people here are 12 years old and the definition of immature child. 
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;The game will come out and you can play it. People who dont like streamers arent going to ruin anything. Chill the fuck out.
---
I don‚Äôt really get why that‚Äôs an option if they don‚Äôt want people to have the opportunity for people to stop socializing.
---
&gt;L33T5P34K
---
And that was fucking dumb when I was 13.
---
Pretty sure the class designer Kevin Jordan mained a ret Pally for a couple expansions at least.
---
Anything goes after the first
---
So you never respecced back then, but still know how hard it would be to tank as fury compared to protectiin?
---
You basically choose to flag for PvP.  If you heal/buff someone who is flagged, then you are also flagged for a time.  If you attack an opposing faction's NPC then you will be flagged. 
---
Contrary to current popular belief, there is actually a lot of PvP still happening on PvE servers.  Town/city raids happened constantly, quest givers still got camped which would force the faction of said quest giver to respond in mass, and factions would still screw with each other a lot.  
---
The only real difference is that there isn't the element of danger that a PvP server brings.  You cannot be ganked/camped against your will, and there is always the excitement factor for some that comes with that.  
---
Most of the negativity surrounding PvE right now are from those who have no idea what they were actually like; back then, PvE servers were the most popular by 20%~ by the end of vanilla.  Doesn't mean they are/were better, but it is because you don't really miss out on all that much by playing on one.
---
It was not only honor but eventually it was the pvp currencies, Marks of Alterac Valley or whatever.  You'd get three if you won, and a single Mark if you lost.  And you'd need like...  30-100 Marks to get some of the gear I think.  So when AV lasted 6 hours and you lost...  It felt bad, even thought the battle itself was really cool.
---
100% agree.  For me daily quests were the worst addition to the game.
---
It's also what got me to quit during icc.
---
From what I read there are usually level 58's in the raids that do MC first lockout, not everyone is 60
---
Which is kinda cool in itself
---
because solo players played wow since day 1  
---
they would've all quit if blizzard didn't allow them to play new stuff apart from world content
---
I know how to screenshot, however it was just easier to snap a pic with phone and post it. I did it as I was walking out the door.
---
Why be a jerk?
---
The Classic servers will be newly named ones.  Blizzard confirmed this.  It's a good idea to avoid confusion with the current realms.  So, there won't be a KT Classic realm.  Thus, everyone will be rolling into a "new" server for Classic.
---
Definitely a subreddit for that.
---
Give away your kids.
---
It was designed to be gated content, to require players to log in every day and work towards a greater goal. How else do you do that with reputation if not dailies?
---
It has to do a lot with the fact BfA is trash. In Legion I wasn't even thinking about trying a private server. I'd rather play Legion until Classic release than BfA.
---
How do healers gain pvp rank or get honorable kills in wow classic? If someone they heal gets a kill do they get the points or how does it work?
---
No, you don't get flagged unless you attack a player who is flagged, an opposing faction's NPC, or buff/healer a flagged teammate.  
---
If something flags you, it might be only cities, as I remember being able to attack horde trying to get to stockades.
---
True that
---
Hey, OP didn't say it was Goldshire on Moonguard...
---
On PvE this is true.  Cities auto flag, but NOTHING else in the game will force you into a pvp state while on a PvE server.  You have to attack someone/something that is flagged first, or assist a teammate who is flagged.  Or simply turn it on yourself.
---
Is it still like that?
---
I don't recall if healing shares pvp, but if you are in a group you will share honor even without doing damage.
---
He's got insane knowledge of the game and its history, whether or not he's in the top 0.1% of players.  He is very passionate about the game and it shows.  Some percentage of his following stems from those traits.
---
I doubt it.  That mentality is why the state of MMOs struggle today, a lack of identity trying to please everyone.
---
Not if you don't like getting ganked/camped.  Not everyone cares to play a PvE game with the odd chance someone chooses to camp you for as long as they can get away with it.  
---
Every PvP scenario apart from ganking/full time camping is possible on a PvE server.  There is no trap, only personal preference.
---
Dungeons are crap xp, unless you run them with all quests.

Maybe 20 days? Maybe 22? Or 12? Who knows..but pretty sure it wont be 24 days on /played this time
---
Best friend is a warrior since Vanilla so I just go off of what he says.
---
"I just want to experience the game I've been waiting for 15 years to play by dramatically changing how it plays, I'm intelligent."
---
This is what I gathered from all the info in the replies. The only question I have no is how are places like Elwynn Forest and Westfall treated. Are they Alliance territory or Neutral. There seems to be a lot of mixed info out there, trying to find someone in the beta who can confirm.
---
Did you actually participate in it? Because right now the event isn't on.
---
I'd love to see Shaman T2
---
My friend has a GTX780 and it has shadowplay functions. The GPU only needs to have the integrated H.264 codec and every card from 600 series and upwards has this (obviously nvidia only, I heard AMD has also something like this but I am out of the loop AMD wise).
---
Wow I‚Äôm blind I didn‚Äôt even see that!
---

We dont hate them. But because autistic 12 year old can't understand basic human emotions they take any criticism as hate and flip out.
---
There's already a version of the game which takes everything you just said into account. It's available right now and has a major update coming in a few weeks.
---
That is kind of lame. I really wish that Alliance territory was actually treated like Alliance territory and not Neutral territory.
---
Indeed, a good choice :)
---
Depends how you define max, but generally any mid range computer from the last 5 years will be fine a 1080p/Very High.
---
It‚Äôs pretty telling that Druid didn‚Äôt even make it into your list there.
---
I personally can‚Äôt think of anything right now, I‚Äôll make sure to edit my comment if I do.
---
I just wanted to say this is a really good idea and I‚Äôm glad someone with your knowledge of putting it on
---
You say that as if PvP servers also weren't massively imbalanced... it was rare to have a near 50:50 balance on PvP... that never changed.  It was the main reason I was forced to roll PvE after having started on 2 different PvP servers at the time.
---
My first server had a huge horde advantage, so I transferred to another with some friends where it was seemingly even, only to have the horde outnumber us again by a massive margin a couple months later.
---
We eventually said "screw it" and transferred to a PvE server and just went along with out gameplay without getting super camped everywhere we went.  There is a reason PvE servers ended up being 20%~ more popular than PvP back then.
---
doubt what?  
---
blizzard is the one with numbers and data  
---
there is a reason every mmo has lfr of sorts today
---
I hope they keep the beta server up
---
But you don‚Äôt. You want several QoL changes made to the game over the years to be implemented. So yeah, i guess it is too much to ask honestly
---
Alliance territory
---
I think this sub and the streams give an inaccurate representation of who is going to play.  I strongly believe there will be &gt;60% of the population that has never played vanilla.  
---
It won't be much different then someone who rolled vanilla as it was accelerating in a middle patch, a lot of new people but a lot of people playing alts that already knew the game.
---
so calling yourself a pvp warrior means that you're saying pve objectives are, for you, not fun? and you should be able to earn gold in a way that is fun based on what you like to do?
---
so you wanted more options in endgame for getting gold and progressing? well, I mean we got those with each successive expansion; we got more things for single players to do in Cata and MOP. so I guess that's something
---
ZUG ZUG
---
I think you mean "quote unquote". Just clarifying, not grammar naziing.
---
Except that the drunk is actually a streamer fanboy pretending to be something that doesn't exist.
---
This is hilarious. Complaining about neck beards ruining your game because you went and had 5 kids in the time since classic left us haha. Stop being such a pussy
---
yeah, google voice to text blows
---
I browsed through that and cant for the life of me figure out what you want me to see here, lol
---
that's actually quite comforting to hear. 
---
thanks dude
---
Why do so many people think this was the case?  PvE servers only lack a couple things compared to PvP servers.
---
You wont get ganked/camped against your will.  All other PvP can and will take place, such as NPC camping, town/city raiding, and a form of baiting to initiate constant fighting anyway.  
---
The difference between PvP and PvE is not some vast one and it never has been lol
---
I think it's pretty likely they will. It looks like the beta server is struggling for players a bit, a lot of people are dropping out and not levelling to 40.  
---
They're probably going to do more rounds to keep interest up and just for testing purposes.
---
If you're good at your class, you'll be fine. Regardless of what tour class is.
---
Ya DoOd FuCk ThE kIdS bRo
---
R o u g e
---
You have the beta or are just guessing? Assuming you do have the beta, did you go there on a horde? Were you auto flagged for pvp?
---
I tanked UBRS every single week for months as an Arms Warrior. It was no issue.
---
You don‚Äôt have to play it if you don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôll be just fine without people who want that kind of stuff.
---
Yes, i know... but there are also addons like this groupfinder thing which might get broken by blizzard... So i thought they might block questie also
---
You're a bad father then.
---
Cities will flag you, but otherwise you need to flag yourself in one way or another.

However, NPCs can be attacked at any given time, and this is usually how most fights started on PvE servers.  Town/city raids still formed and happened all the time.
---
Why are you like this?
---
Had to save this thread to always look back to when I need a good laugh, or feel like I‚Äôve been a poor father and need a comparison to lift me up
---
This is my porn!
---
I did not read it myself.

"There are also 4 areas for outdoor World PvP in Outland: Hellfire Peninsula, Zangarmarsh, Terokkar Forest and Nagrand."
---
My guess is the rest are not.

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-horde-races-and-racial-abilities
---
The racials info is correct, some of the class-race best combos are questionable.
---
You keep saying this dude, but PvP servers were also imbalanced, except in favor of horde lol...  
---
Both server types suffer from massive faction imbalance over time.
---
Sorta what i was thinking but lvling hunter purely for that is a big undertaking
---
Yep, same. I started just as TBC was launching so I kinda had the levelling classic/tbc experience but none of the endgame.
---
We will see.  I think it‚Äôll be an interesting launch for a number of reasons.  And admittedly a lot of the below have nothing to do with when they released the beta...but somethings i predict impacting the launch:
---
1. Streamers are not going to reveal their server for the first week or so.  I don‚Äôt know how they plan to do this as all someone would have to do is identify another player on their screen and /who them to confirm it was same server.  But whatever measures they take may make their streams less entertaining.  
---
2.  People playing not watching.  A lot of people watched streamers on beta bc they couldn‚Äôt play themselves...a lot of people also watched streamers to figure out what class they wanted and how to play it.  A lot of people are going to be playing and leveling instead of watching.  And as we all know hype begets hype...with less people watching stream less of that younger crowd is going to purchase that first crucial month.  
---
3.  Rapid loss of interest.  So this game has 2 demographics that will dramatically drop 1-2 months after release.  The first is my group...the 29-39+ year olds who played this game in college and are going to play again based off nostalgia.  My group associates the game with their younger years and being stress free and happy.  Many many in this group will level their characters to mid 20s or 30s but then when it becomes a grind will dwindle as a lot realize it‚Äôll never be the same.  We were different people 15 years ago...and what enraptured us back then is unlikely to impact us the same way.  In addition to changing ourselves...our lives have changed.  My age group will see they can‚Äôt always log on because they have kids, they have totally different social commitments, they have totally different work commitments,  they go to bed at 9pm or any of all the things that prevent grownups from playing video games.  They will lose interest and their character will remain below 40 until they cancel...their nostalgia having been quelled.  
---
The second group are the younger people who never really played vanilla.  This group for years heard how amazing it used to be...or remember their older brother raiding MC...but have themselves grown up with either the easy mode that WoW leveling has become or far faster paced and prettier games like Fortnite and the new Pokemons.  Vanilla WoW is a tremendous game...but gaming has evolved over the last 15 years and the younglings may not be ready to go back in time.  When this group gets that mount or right before it and then realizes they have 100s of thousands of xp to grind before they can reach 60...and they‚Äôre already sick of killing their 3000th furbolg...the game just can‚Äôt hold their millenial attention span.   
---
4.  School.  They released this game right when school starts.  So much of their audience will be more caught up in going back to school and won‚Äôt be able to grind all wednesday night like they could have all summer.  
---
5.  Winter games.  By the time September hits people will already be hype about the big November/December releases.
---
Having said all that...MANY MANY of us will play the hell out of this game.  For me personally, no game compares to WoW.  Never have i played a game like I did WoW and I cannot wait to revisit the game now 15 years later. 
---
Anyways...obviously just my opinions...what do u think?
---
Outland isn‚Äôt Vanilla? I‚Äôm so confused by what this has to do with the subject?
---
Raids are fine but dungeons are very difficult, specifically gearing prior to raids.  Most of your tanks are warriors, most of them are fury/arms and tanking in that spec.  They will want to control the groups and disallow rogues to enter so less loot competition. They will also "reserve" items for themselves and they won't run it anymore after they get theirs.  It's not always like this, but it is a LOT.  For the most part, you will not have as many fair chances at loot as any other class.  I base this on my experiences of having a rogue, mage, and warrior at level 60.
---
My best advise is to make good friends while you level.  In the end, I honestly would have never made it past that initial hump had I not had a few friends I was helpful too that liked having me around personally and within the gameplay.  If you expect to get somewhere in pugs alone, you will be disappointed in this class.
---
that LFR brain at work here I see
---
It's fine. Getting into guilds/raids should be easy. Getting the gear you want might be slightly more difficult than some less played classes, but nothing game breaking. 
---
Getting into dungeon groups might be a little bit harder than some classes too (due to gear overlap and stuff), but not a major problem.
---
I have an RX570 graphics card (2 yr old) and an i3 4th gen (\~5 yrs old) and I'm running BfA at near max while walking around town.
---
the only issue is that when you don't "play for fun" you don't get shouted at by elitist wankers
---
Depends on your commitment to raiding end-game content ‚Äî in other words, how many hours per week do you have to acquire said epic gear.  Arguably, one of the coolest looking sets is Tier 2 Judgement Armor for Paladins, collecting it means clearing Blackwing Lair, not many guilds cleared it in vanilla.
---
You weren't forced, but if it's something you didn't enjoy that is a fine reason to quit.
---
Retail is ready and waiting for you my fren.
---
It's so late in the game and so hard to get it's almost certainly going to go to someone in the Guild's leadership.
---
Bottom line is that we don't know if classic raid bosses will be harder or easier than most pservers.  
---
We do know that all damage/resist/armor/attack frequency numbers are not 100% accurate on pservers, and also some mechanics such as deep breath or flame buffet are completely wrong (by pserver dev's own admissions).
---
In what world is expressing what I‚Äôm exited about in a thread labeled ‚Äúwhat are you excited about‚Äù not relevant?
---
Threads aren‚Äôt independent entities. The discussion of the sub in general, and being excited for the sub to change, is completely relevant to his question.
---
Maybe I will. Fuck this shit it's too much effort
---
You suck
---
Undo this post. Pls.
---
You are all over the place man, I feel like half the time you are half-listening to what I say at best and arguing with imaginary people the other half lol.
---
I don't think anyone expects Blizzard to do anything. They are saying they hope Blizzard remakes future expacks to be more like classic, which includes not having flying, dailies or badges. Those are not hypocritical in the slightest. They want Classic as is because they think it's the best base of WoW, and they want the other expansions remastered and changed to fit the Classic theme in mechanics. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in the NoChanges camp, give me changes if they will actually make the game better, so I'm not defending that crowd, it's just you are arguing unrelated points and claiming hypocrisy where it isn't.
---
Of course people loved flying. People loved being able to get badge gear too. If you just trade someone gold for their mount they would probably take it and say thank you too. That's also not hypocrisy, it's realizing that the short term goodness of these things cheapen the game in the long run and the initial hit of dopamine pales in comparison to the feeling of actually earning a long awaited item. The truth is people will ALWAYS take the path of least resistance. If you give people an easy option they will take it, even at the detriment of their own experience. That's just how it is and something developers have had to fight for a long time. Players want these things removed because they know they will do it if it's in the game and they'd just rather not. 
---
No one is demanding changes, they just are suggesting them. You seem to be very combative for no reason. No one cares if you disagree or hates you for it? I have no idea why you act like you can't possible understand how they feel though. Maybe you don't feel the same way, which is totally fine, but you can very easily understand them even if you don't agree. We have explained it multiple times in multiple ways. Not sure what else to tell you, tbh. I've explained how they and even myself feel the best I can and you can either accept it or not. Idk.
---
Look up their tiers - it's nothing like BFA and will require attendance and patience to get a set.
---
Hundreds and hundreds of hours.
---
Same here. That's when it started to feel like a chore most of the time, and resemble a mobile game
---
All the start zones are Faction owned. Otherwise no one would get past level 5 after about a week. Imagine all the level 30 rogues slaughtering people running from Abbey to Lions pride.
---
You might be right, to be fair.  I know I'll be taking skinning to shore up my finances, but that only adds a few seconds per mob kill rather than being outright grinding.
---
:o *surprised pikachu face
---
&gt;	rely
---
I never said it was irrelevant. You‚Äôre simply perpetuating the very thing you say you hate. 
---
It‚Äôs funny. That‚Äôs what I said.
---
To be fair, Dara Mactire falling apart and the growth of Tichondrius as pvp‚Äôers switched from Alliance to Horde also played a factor.
---
Nope, free for all baby!
---
here's a nice tool, select the sex/race combo on the left and then the class on the right.
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1172
---
Yes, but you need 40 people to all basically play 18-20 hours a day for the first week and rush to 60 (some being warriors who wont go nearly as quickly as other classes without the /sit exploit) and at least get some basic gear going in.  
---
We know that Rag will be properly spamming fireballs on classic as opposed to it bugging out on pservers, so this could mean fire resist is going to be extremely important... if that ends of being the case, it can take a lot of time to get enough people in enough FR to get through the fight.
---
You‚Äôre a piece of shit father and I‚Äôm sorry for your kids
---
Thats simply not true. All it takes is time and a bit of drop luck. If your main or second tank in a casual guild you have a good chance of getting tf at some point.
---
You cannot chase people, so yea a 55mage will evade you, but he would evade about 1/2 the classes in the game if he played it right.  
---
For healing you want stam, int, and+healing, but collect a 2nd set with as much spell power as possible and you can play shockadin while in solo play.  
---
Ideal shockadin is 31/0/20, but can be played almost as well at 31/20/0 which is the primary pvp healing build.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay7RU0N-44Y
---
Most of this guys gear is standard black wing layer level of gear, only the meteor trinket is really rare, but it can be replaced almot as well with stuff like, six demon bag, goblin mortar, or gnomish death ray.
---
This is stupid
---
Lol you posted this again?
---
Play BFA and get over yourself.
---
every little detail regarding specs and min/max theorycrafting is online now for a game that is 3 months away. Lots of people will be going in there with a plan.
---
What? I am asking about PvE servers
---
Dailies could be cool.
---
They way I would do dailies is that any place that you have a flightpath to in the world, Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, can send a letter asking you for help. 
---
So let's say you got a letter from Gadgetzan, you accept it at the mailbox and then you fly there and do a small lvl 60 quest chain. Next day it's Kargath in Badlands or Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows. Each location has a unique set of rewards ontop of some gold. Maybe even a buff is granted at the end of the quest chain.
---
This system makes you go out in the world and increases the chance of WPvP.
---
&gt;If you are convinced that the PvE mobs alone could not be beaten by forty toons working together
---
You are missing the point entirely.  The PVE parts of original AV *could* be zerged by one side without too much of an issue *if the other side left them alone*.  But 30 Horde against 10-15 alliance and the Alliance Lieutenant, Lieutenant guards, and tower archers?  The Alliance would have the advantage.  And *everybody knew this* back then so You'd have multiple fronts where your 15 or so Defense Dudes would be setting up to block the incoming zerg while your Offense Dudes would be off doing other stuff.  The elites hit hard and stunning the tank so they couldn't block or parry or fearing him so he would drop aggro, sending elites to wreck cloth characters...  Everything was so much more interesting and engaging.  Now, the NPC's are a complete joke and there is no point in even having a defense unless it's the majority of your team, because the NPC's no longer pull any weight.
---
Which class does not at least partially rely on grenades? If you're playing on any higher level (which is the only time racials really matter).
---
You don't make the game, play it and shut up or don't, doesn't matter to anyone here. 
---
We hope you enjoy your 3 month stay in Classic! Come back soon ;)
---
Tier 1 is still bis for phase 1 only exceptions being helm and legs because tier 2 is available in those slots.   However if you haven‚Äôt gotten those than tier 1 in every slot is bis
---
A good hunter or 2 is essential for raids tho
---
More like close to triple.  Layering is going to allow for 10k~ people to be on in theory.
---
Hm. Everyone who thinks classic wow is too hard... play Everquest / DaoC or any other game of this time... 
---
Well or even better. Host a Pserver and use GM commands for your needs... win-win i would say.
---
Multiboxing has minor benefits and arguably bigger drawbacks. Also they are not especially common. Really, really not a problem as far as I can see.
---
Forget about the 3 layers lol?
---
Sounds like a multi boxer
---
Rogue were one of the best dps in raids before all that min-max with warriors. Now almost all melee in raids are warriors. They out-dps rogue and are more resilient. Rogues to get maximum dmg need debuff slots. Same thing with pvp. Warrior out-dps and are more resilient. Rogue in pvp mostly guard the flags.
---
The one in the picture is an Asus 165Hz IPS monitor. High-end gaming ips monitors are expensive, I dont blame you if you dont have one or tried one, but they are fucking amazing.
---
Rely is a qualifier for stuns, not grenades
---
Nice try horde scum
---
Only thing to be proven overtuned on pservers so far is the 1-30 experience... we have no idea how raids will turn out yet. 
---
All we know is that raids are wrong on pservers.  They could be harder, or they could be easier.
---
selling consumables on AH is less profitable than selling their herb ingredients
---
The read text on The Eye of Divinity:
---
&gt;When you peer into the Eye, images of a great battle fill your mind..  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This terrifying conflict appears to be taking place somewhere in Lordaeron..  
---
&gt;You can barely make out a lone female figure, standing amidst a thousand corpses, fending off a sea of Scourge..  
---
&gt;She is hopelessly outnumbered..  
---
&gt;Tendrils of light escape her hands, cutting through undead by the hundreds.   
---
&gt;All for naught, it would seem..  
---
&gt;Moments later the priestess is swarmed by the corpses of the peasants that were surrounding her....  
---
&gt;The fallen have risen. 
---
The NPC Eris Havenfire was a priestess who fell protecting civilians fleeing Stratholme during the scourge invasion. You can see her ghost when equipping The Eye of Divinity and do the following quest:
---
&gt;You must do what I could not: Save the peasants that were cut down while fleeing from Stratholme.  
---
&gt;They will walk towards the light, you must ensure their survival. Should too many fall, our cursed existence shall continue - you will have failed.  
---
&gt;Every ability, prayer, and spell that you have learned will be tested. May the Light protect you, &lt;name&gt;.
---
not true. 5/8 t1 is in demand very much so for a 31/8/12 seal fate rogue for pvp.
---
We dont. We just don't like them. And their 12 year old autistic fanboys can't understand the difference and interpret and criticism of streamers as something like "REEEEEEEE fuck streamers" or some shit.
---
That would be grandpas.
---
But when I get a lvl 8 BoE drop, I'll throw it on the AH, and inevitably someone will be running through a main city pissed about dying to Vagash, and go pick up my gear with the silvers they told themselves they'd save.
---
What I'm saying is, the market will form very quickly. People will save things to sell, others will have hoarded gold/silver to buy.
---
I literally said t1 is PvP gear.......
---
nah, there were mines in 1.12.1. Both the kind you step on and the kind you capture for resources.
---
Can confirm. Was a bounty Hunter in old school SWG. My endgame was hunting down every last Jedi skum.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think class matters.   It does perform best on mage, but usually it would go to whoever deserves it the most. Usually a guild leader or officer will take it, regardless of class.
---
It was casual at the time, compared to the modern MMO market it isnt. I agree that the no-changes people are pretty dumb, like you can maintain the design philosophy of a game without keeping things 100% the same, vanilla wasnt perfect. That said, just suck it up, this sort of attitude is what led to things like LFG and LFR, as obvious a troll as it is.
---
Holy pally are support beasts. But if you want to heal and also kill people 1v1 go priest. They are amazing healers (arguably the best) and can totally put out some dmg and 1v1 anything.
---
Was VC for us on Thunderhorn, Garona, Cho'Gall, Onyxia and Detheroc. I played from Dec04 to Legion, and still knew people in the later years who used 'VC' instead of 'DM'.
---
What?
---
Just collect it. 
---
You likely wont have all the BiS pre raid gear unless you no life it anyway, and the same will go for most.  
---
The gear would be better off getting used than thrown away imo.  Tier sets are still decent for certain specs of each class, and in some cases it can be faster to get t1 than pre raid BiS depending on how early you start raiding.
---
It's waaaay more than a beta. We are literally watching streamers play the game three months in advance and it SUCKS.
---
if u ain‚Äôt a millennium or a zoomer, you‚Äôre a boomer
---
I just wish people reacted to Asmongold threads on the front page of this sub, the same way to do me simply stating I‚Äôm excited for change.
---
A gear/character planner would be amazing and something I‚Äôve been missing ever since chardev shut down! Get all the calculations right for hit crit etc and let us measure against different lvls. Weapon and Defence skills are tricky to get right so that would be a great help :)
---
T1 is not bis for raiding. Devilsaur set is better for those slots, I don't even play rogue and I know that t1 is not over gear
---
No, no, no... a thousand times no. There would be a group of people who reach sixty 1st and they would literally farm anyone who hits 50 after that. Not only to get whatever they have on them but to stop anybody from becoming a threat.
---
I'm excited about just taking my time and exploring the world again.
---
Thanks, i will give a heads up if i need assistance ;)
---
Just don't then?
---
Warriors need to be hit or hit to gain rage. Prot war gains more from being hit. I believe they changed it in wrath. I don‚Äôt remember being rage starved from a bubble then. There should be patch notes or a google reference though.
---
The blades edge dailies gave consumables for gruul. I actually really like that model. They aren't chores, they are something you do to get ready for a raid.
---
Certain professions will for sure but I dont think its going to be that bad.
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from. 
---
I‚Äôve never really been big into the twitch/stream scene. I haven‚Äôt noticed that community affecting me at all, however I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just oblivious and it does affect others. 
---
Streamers are both good and bad I suppose
---
I always go Darkshore to like 17 or 18. Make my way to Westfall to get the Deadmines quests. Which is terribly inefficient, but I like doing dungeons. I like getting that damn staff and it feels bad to just ignore it.
---
You would not log back into the same AV but you had a chance to queue into the same AV again.  Back then, each server had a limited number of battlegrounds that could be running, and battlegrounds would only end if the end goal was reached.  So if nobody killed the final boss in AV, that AV would remain running for days on end until one side finally killed the boss.  Same thing could potentially happen in WSG, if neither side capped three flags, but it was a lot less likely.
---
Justifying spending that amount of money ON A CHAIR is hard, even if its only yourself you have to convince...
---
Thanks for wanting to help!
---
//Zhunga
---
Like I don't mind having to do things, I don't mind there been reps I need, I don't mind needing to run dungeons. I just want to do it on my own time. 
---
Dailys make it so that the only effective way to play is to log in for short burst of time each day. Just give me a list of shit i need to get done and allow me to complete it as effectively if I play 10 hours in one day or 10 hours over 2 weeks.
---
I‚Äôm NA! :(
---
I don't think brute force is necessarily needed.  Last time my account was hacked it was back when D3 came out and Blizzard suffered a massive data breach as the chinese came in full force after all that sweet sweet real money auction house dough.
---
That being said, I think we're dumb to put all our eggs in one basket with our games on the same [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.  I'll be starting fresh account(s) for classic.
---
The 6/8 set bonus is a rare source of spell damage in the gear available in phase 1 for a holy build in solo farming/pvp, but beyond that it's pretty trash. You can get some blue pre-raid plate/mail that does a similar job, but six pieces of T0 can fill in gaps pretty reasonably.
---
The servers will allow more than 3k  but there will be layering so that there arent more than a servers worth of people in 1 place. This is because a huge chunk of people will likely quit before 60, so they dont want to only allow 3k on a server and then have an unlucky one where 75% or more quit playing in the first month. So the server size will be inflated at launch to allow for the inevitable drop off of players that quit before 60.
---
Not really, his reddit name is a movie star, but considering it's a 2 year old account, it's probably the Rick &amp; Morty meme. That's not his real name or related to his account in any way, so the key alone would do absolutely nothing.
---
Yes absorbed damage doesn't generate rage. It isn't a huge issue but can be annoying if your priest is constantly preshielding you before pulls.  
---
The bigger issue is pw:s is a poor efficiency spell and priests the spam it run oom, that actually does slow down the group. You should ony use it when necessary (ie you're worried someone will die before a heal lands).
---
Millennials are the 30yr olds
---
Arms still outdamages most other specs in the game (just not combat rogues or fury warriors) and MS is one of the lowest priority debuffs in the game.  I knew plenty of guys raiding AQ40 and naxx40 who chose to raid as arms and did extremely well.
---
I'll have a look into that myself, as I am not greatly familiar with the different variables of a character during classic. But that is noted, thank you :)
---
I'm pretty sure mines are in the 1.12.1 version
---
Id agree except this is fucking nothing compared to the toxicity of the official classic general discussion forum
---
Hell yes shaman t3!
---
Idk, there's always gonna be elitists in games, they were even in vanilla. It's just something you gotta get over.
---
Yeah I recently went shopping for one... Waaaay to pricey for decent performance. I went with a ¬£400 27 1440p va panel instead... Extremely happy with it.
---
There's always the option to grind boars in the forest.
---
__Rely is a qualifier for stuns, not grenades__

Am I really the only one who remembers there being 1-2 PvE arms warriors in AQ40/naxx40?  They were still very good damage dealers and could beat most specs in the game apart from fury warriors and combat rogues in the end.
---
It might not be the best way to min max, but you can absolutely raid as a PvE leaned arms build... the debuff priority is extremely low, so you wont be bumping off the more important ones unless there are too many arms warriors to begin with.
---
Yes, you get more gold, but you also play more characters. Depending on content, it gets quite difficult to control them all properly and 5 people playing 1 char each will often be better/richer per person than one guy trying to control 5 chars.
---
If you add automation or bots to the multibox, that is a different story. However, as far as I know, that is not allowed, only controlling all by hand and switching between running WoW instances is?
---
This comment gives me hope
---
I agree with you, but I think it‚Äôs worth noting that AV won‚Äôt be releasing for like a year after launch, since iirc it‚Äôs in the last phase and each phase has some 3 months of gap between em. Don‚Äôt quote me on that, I might be wrong
---
That is one change that would cause me to quit.
---
and those layers can still interact with each other, because we know they're there. you scrape the 60's from every layer and you're ready. if you're on a server with a population of 10k split into 3k-ish layers, you still have a pool of 10k players to choose from
---
For min/maxing you should give it to a mage first for the buff it provides, then you can give it to whomever. But to be honest, when you're at the point of the game where you can get an Atiesh you don't really care about min/maxing anymore. You should always give it to your most dedicated player no matter what class that might be.
---
Minor thing, shield block is very little damage reduction for its rage.  The main use for it at end game is to push crushing blow off the hit table, but at low level you don't have the +defense to do so.
---
Not saying it is a bad ability, and if you are dying you should use it, but demo shout for example is more damage reduction and more threat for the same rage at the beginning of a pull.
---
I like the PvP coloured version, but yes I agree.
---
Well its currently a mix from diffrent sources wowhead, other open source databases and self obtained info from wikis and diffrent sites
---
What's the general consensus regarding locked chests in dungeons and rogues and blacksmiths with keys?
---
Not trying to start an argument, but how would that affect the game realistically at all?
---
If min maxing isn't an issue, then a PvE arms build is still very high DPS in raids and still gets you that insane PvP power that the OP wants.
---
Terminator reference, In game it is a quest for some blacksmith plans. Some fire res + small ammount of fire damage per hit gloves.
---
Yeah, in early AV, being undergeared was less of an issue because you could still help out your side by doing the summon quests.  Taming wolfs and killing rams to summon the ram riders, etc, far away from the front lines.
---
You could still do that post 1.12 AV, but with the nerfed NPC's it was easier for smaller groups or even solo-players to sneak passed and just wreck the shit out of undergeared players doing the summon-quests in the back.
---
I agree with you. But then that 60% will leave a month or more in.
---
when it comes to leveling, ultimately just get a pet you like. i would recommend something that can learn bite and in my opinion a fast attack speed cat is the best overall pet but in the end have fun with it and change up your pet every now and then. you already know what to do when you hit 60,  [Here's a list of all pet attack speeds.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php)
---
Troll&gt;Orc though. Especially in tryhard guilds. Threat is everything to tryhards and Trolls&gt;Orcs in threat gen.
---
Damn i seen it like 15 years ago but i still remembered that the Shaman CM will get pulled in :D

Im going to renew my account but tbh I have zero interest in retail atm. Solely focusing on Classic.
---
Xfire was also what I used. I have no screenshots either, but haven't tried to get into my xfire account or even fucking remember it, tbh. Was there an xfire conversion where everyone lost shit, or just something that happened to you? Would like to know before I waste time trying to recover account.
---
I almost got it playing pretty casually as a MT in Vanilla. I expect to see far more of them these days. Hell even back in Vanilla during pre TBC event there was Rogues and Paladins with them.

A PvE arms spec still deals high DPS when compared to the vast majority of specs in the game.  The stigma against MS is a bit unfounded imo... MS has one of the lowest priorities in the game and isn't going to knock off something that is of a high priority.  So long as you don't have like 5+ of them at least.
---
25% Stun resist is nice and all but that Regen and Blood Lust makes up for it.
---
lol what a fucking idiot
---
Fury also gets deep wounds, so arms just adds one of the lowest priority debuffs in the game and wont knock off much of anything.
---
I thought about it but I was kicked from my high end raiding guild bc I was dpsing in AQ40 as a resto druid on trash pulls.  I don't think they want to remember me haha
---
People will post in chat if an enemy is seen somewhere, just check the chat of the regions around you. ;)
---
But people here will answer that it's because we're oh so upset that they have beta access or because they make money playing games.  As if that's what the complaint is!
---
To be fair, I only play for short stretches. Maybe a half hour to forty five minutes at a stretch. Last night I played for a little over an hour, which was the longest play stretch I've done. I'm mostly using pserver to build hype and to refamiliarize myself with the world pre-Shattering, which is also why I'm purposely NOT playing the class I intend to main when Classic launches, and am instead playing one of the classes I will be using as an alt.
---
My ui is classic and default, his is cancer.
---
&gt;camp them
---
For 5 minutes until their flag wears off, which is nothing when you consider corpse runs and such.
---
i loved the heroic dailies, because me and a friend were notoriously camping the instance entrances with full pvp geared mage and warlock. i started to lose interest in the game when "looking for dungeon" got implemented and suddenly there were no people running to dungeons anymore... that day was a sad day :(
---
Yeah, ive been looking at the warlock stuff, and in some slots there are dungeon blues with much higher spell damage and better stats that the tier gear. Supposedly the atalai gloves with shadow damage from ST are bis till bwl

Thanks for all your input guys !
---
Even alliance 2h fury is good.  Wont compete with DW, but you still beat out most specs in the game in the end.
---
&gt;players don't have 360 vision
---
basically this. even though the sm will go out once you start to cast the shot, the time of reaction for your target won't be enough to receive the shot.
---
Not Drownging Pool but equally as annoying soundtrack, great find!
---
a normal hunter shouldn't have problems to deal with rogues without stoneform. i think that more experienced players would prefer nelf due to sm.
---
It really depends on how strong the stigma will really be.  I am sure a hardcore guild might be tough to convince, but numbers will speak for themselves in the end.  
---
At the end of the day though.. how many hardcore guilds will there actually be per server?  Usually isn't the common type anyway.
---
You have no idea what millennial means.

you cant do this! Level in Classic meant to be hard and slow, you cant pull more than one mob at a time!

Hello, I‚Äôve made a base stats calculator that does already does this:

---
But being able to input items would be cool too.
---
"Thereat generation isn't an issue for 95% of guilds"
---
Sorry I stopped reading after this. Have you even raided past BWL? Threat Gen is the #1 priority to top teir guilds.
---
It also had so many different ways you could approach it. It was much more sandbox in comparison to other more linear dungeons. Most of the current dungeons are almost exclusively linear. This would never make it to live for a number of reasons including but not limited to time to complete the whole thing, and its ability to be turned into commodifiable competitive esports. Its kind of also similarly why I liked larger battlegrounds to arena. Individual skill should not be the focus of a roleplay game, except at the very fringe. The most important thing is teamwork and team play. Past a baseline skill and gear level, team work should make up more of the end result than individual skill. Then for the top 1% of 1% so to speak, individual skill should work its way back in to separate teams.
---
They are very very very close to the same as far as stats go.   Devilsaur is slightly ahead. But I mean you still want tier 2 pants over devilsaur. And if you break the 2 piece you don‚Äôt want devilsaur gloves anymore.    But either way. You are still using almost all of tier 1. And you can use all of it over devilsaur and really not lose out on much.     To say you don‚Äôt use tier 1 because it‚Äôs only for pvp is just wrong though
---
it took the entire group to get them there, they should unlock it for whoever wins a /roll
---
but really the rogue will say his lockpicking isn't high enough, then stealth back after everyone hearths at the end
---
if you don't know how to play, yes, not useful.
---
meanwhile the best hunter in vanilla has the opposite opinion.

Anything like that where you can just straight up halt of reset another player's progression would need to be a PVE situation. Otherwise you would literally have bandits - cross-faction organizations where one person creates an alternate account on the opposing faction, everyone gets into discord and then suddenly you're surrounded by the other faction with one person from yours negotiating with you for your life. 
---
It sounds cool in theory but in truth it'd choke a server to death pretty quick. Before the end of the content cycle you'd have a couple bandit cartels on each faction who have come to the agreement that fighting each other isn't worth the risk after they've absorbed or destroyed the smaller ones. 
---
Best case scenario is one final bandit war before the server is completely dead once the losing guild quits.

Exactly.  My point being that while most pservers had a 10k cap, 3 layers could potentially go higher than that for a while.  
---
The player numbers aren't the factor here at the end of the day.  The big question is what the true values of raid mobs will end up being.
---
If extra attacks can proc Paladins seals and Rogues poison then I don't see why they wouldn't proc Windfury.
---
iirc it didn't work like that 100% of the time.

A  ¬£400 27" 1440p will not be far off from an IPS panel with the same specs. I have had both the 27" 1440p IPS and TN display from Asus. The only way to see a difference is a side by side comparison.

Oh God, I'm old.

The heat of the fire behind him bathed his back in warmth, sending tingles down his spine. The cold that thawed him to the bone slowly melting away as he relaxed into the chair. A small knot birthed into the chair poked sharply into his back, but he didnt mind. To be honest, most of the furniture in The Kings Reach tavern was rough. Even so, most of it had to be far older than Vymi since it looked just as old and used as when he first saw it as a child. Not to say mr Lain let the tavern go to ruin, the tables and chairs may have been old but the old man and his daughters kept the place neat and tidy. Vymi's eyes glanced around the room. It was a quiet evening, only about 5-6 other groups together talking excitedly about this news or that.   Just enough voices to kill the quiet but too many to keep track of one conversation. His glance fell onto Victoria, mr Lains eldest daughter. It had been over a year since he saw her last. Her beauty took him by suprise then, though he had always thought her pretty something was different now. She was washing tables with earnest, her long brown hair in a ponytail and apron fitted and tied tightly behind her slender back. Vymi stared at her for what must have been several moments thinking of what he could say to her before they left. She looked up and her piercing green eyes met his and she smiled. Vymi could feel his face burning as he quickly turned his attention back to his moonberry juice. 
---
"and we didn't care what nobody thought. it was about honor back then and stickin too it" 
---
It was only then that vymi realized his father had been speaking to him. He wondered how long he had been talking but didnt dare ask. His father cyan was a hard worker, spending most of his life near the reach, collecting icecaps from the coldest clutches of the mountains with no name. Cyan was well known in town, often nicknamed cyan ain't blue for his ability to fight the cold for weeks on end. Vymi was there too of course. For as long as he could remember... but he didnt have the determination of his father. His mind always wandered off thinking about elsewhere or dreaming of moving to the far south with Victoria. When they were kids they used to play pretend by the river near Lains tavern, talking about running away together. They would explore the eastern kingdoms and one day settle in stormwind, Vymi as one of the royal guard and Victoria a lady of the trade district. That was just kid stuff though... there was work to do nowadays.

---
Vymi had heard this story a million times... it must have been more than a decade since his father went off to fight the elemental invasion of "ragnaros" he even claimed to have been there when the final strike was struck. the strike that banished the fire lord back to the elemental plane. He partly blamed his father for his daydreams... always speaking of them as legendary while maintaining that he would never be capable.
---
Just then the taverns double wide doors swung open. The icy howl of the wind whistled in and shook vymi's cloak. The flames of the fire behind him dancing shadows against the wall and settling again as the door closed. The tavern was silent, nothing but the crackle of the willow logs in the fire and the high heeled footsteps of the person who entered. Vymi stared his jaw dropping. A woman walked past their table, slowly and confidently. She was taller then any man he had ever known, her skin a soft pinkish color. Strange markings danced across her face making twists and points, that normally would have been threatening on a brigand but where luring and beautiful on her. Soft white hair flowed behind her to the small of her back, adorned with gold clamps and jewels that twinkled against the dim light of the fire. In her hand staff, about the length of her arm, gnarled and twisted at the end encasing a large green stone. She sat alone at the table in the far corner facing the door. Nobody said a word. After what must have been a  very long moment, mr Lain himself timidly walked up to her and introduced himself. As the voices picked up again within the tavern, vymi heard her say

if I'm all over the place, it's because even suggesting removing flying/dailies/badges from BC is a radical "Suggestion".
---
Hoping Blizzard does something as radical as changing every single zone, dumping dailies, and other grinds is pointless because this isn't the same Blizzard we grew up with. The chance of Blizz succeeding after redesigning every profession/zone/economy/gearing progression is near 0%. My post was actually hidden due to the amount of people downvoting it but it looks like it has stabilized now. IMO, it's hypocritical for the people who advocate for #no changes to advocate for changes to BC when it was beloved as well. I guess we will have to have a difference of opinion there.
---
I feel like keeping those mechanics outside of Azeroth doesn't cheapen the game at all. There was no real "Least resistance path" in BC, unlike Wrath and beyond. My leveling experience from 1-60 was pretty much exactly the same as it was in classic. 61-69 you're not even flying or doing dailies anyway so I don't see the issue. You're rewarded with a cool mechanic for hitting level 70 that is gated in the Outlands. Stop with the path of least resistance nonsense. It applies to terrible additions like dungeon finder, not flying in expansion zones. 
---
"No One" is a bold claim. Combative for no reason? Telling people that it would be stupid to suggest or even imply that current Blizzard can totally remodel every zone/profession/etc is radical and then getting downvoted for it lmao.
---
I do that to everyone spamming for a dungeon I might be interested in. 
---
Gotta check if they're an appropriate level and class.

Trash blade :p
---
There's been a lot of old forum posts from allakhazam and such that they "fixed" shamans at some point to prevent this from happening. I don't personally know how true this is. But as Shaman myself back in Vanilla. I certainly don't have the memory to remember the windfury proccing off those particular items.  
---
But that is what my thought is exactly. But there's no proof behind it.
---
Iirc you can‚Äôt heal someone with pvp on if you aren‚Äôt flagged, it says ‚Äúyou must enable pvp to perform this action‚Äù something vaguely like that, unless that was added into another expansion
---
Only opposing city factions will force a PvP flag to turn on.  
---
Being in elwynn as a horde player will not flag you just for being there.  I remember horde even scaring new players at the starting area but still being unable to be attacked by some 60's showing up.  
---
At the end of the day, everything you hear is anecdotal; as you say, we need people on the PvE beta server to post proof, but sadly the beta PvE is extremely underpopulated atm.
---
A utility to compare equippable items would be slick.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Yeah, ive cleared naxx multiple times over on multiple servers. If youre a warrior and doing progression you should have 0 problems with threat. You run into threat problems in MC, BWL when you are speedrunning snd everyone is turbo tryharding in naxx gear. Your first mc run in classic you as the tank should be miles ahead everyone in regards to gear , no one will come close to pulling off you
---
Joannas guide sends you to darkshore and ashenvale alot, even as a non nelf, also know as one of the faster levelling zones after the starting zones, so i recon darkshore will also be fairly busy
---
Tauren 4 life
---
Lol this is my nightmare
---
iirc the set bonus returns the mana cost for healing spells that crit and you have a buttload of Crit by naxx.  So you can just spam heals infinitely without going oom
---
Please be aware that there is not transmog in Classic.
---
The Tier sets look nice (some of the ) but that means you have to have them AND wear them to look nice 
---
A lot of best in slot items aren't Tier gear and for the majority of your gaming on your toon before and after raiding with have you wearing mix/match pieces of gear.
---
Just don't expect to be running around in a nice outfit that matches very often.
---
The sub will become flooded with "HELP" threads - and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
since the beta is capped at lvl40 it's a bit early to tell....
---
I know for sure that windfury cannot proc off of windfury anymore. I would assume that Windfury can proc off of any main swing, but not off the procs of those swings.
---
Communicate with the rankers on your server and set up a schedule. 1 week of rannk 14 for everyone to get their gear. No one gets rank 14 and keeps it.
---
Better personal threat management/visibility/alerts
---
Wouldnt want a group of pepegas running around in my bgs
---
Not a whole lot to talk about that hasn't been said already. The sub will be better when the games actually released.
---
This is actually mostly for MT threat and melee dps i'm looking at in particular, rather than for shamans. However it would mean that Sulfuras + HoJ could be alive or dead.
---
Bananas how the answer is in the quote, people really like making things difficult for themselves.
---
grenades are stuns
---
You'd have to do a massive overhaul to the expansion to remove all of the bad stuff. The actual geometry of the world is designed with flying mounts in mind. Everything would have to be retuned around level 60 and without a gear reset. No Shattrath. It's possible, but it'd be unrecognizable from actual TBC.
---
Yeah. Never played on a private server.
---
Unstuck used to teleport you a few feet in a random direction too IIRC
---
I am so glad I stumbled across this in the stress test. I never played Vanilla so I had absolutely 0 idea stances came from class quests (in retrospect it‚Äôs obvious, though)
---
It's not necessarily negativity. They were just pointing out that whatever method they had utilized was much simpler than the wall climb intensive one we were referring to,
---
No and nopers
---
Trash Blade is available at lvl 39, so test with that will provide info about how the Ironfoe/HoJ will behave when it comes to procs. (Not proc rates though, but what can trigger it to proc)
---
No, not bfa but maybe future expansions we will see a shift. Especially if vanilla is an overwhelming success.
---
Despite the negativity here, there are a lot of people who would love this idea.  Just do a Google search and you'll see.  There were so many posts about it on the official forums, they've started deleting posts about it.
---
People dont want to play with streamers, plain and simple, and if blizz thinks it might cost them money if they dont stream free servers you can bet they'll offer them.
---
It affected wrath when it hit with ulduar, because now the initiate players took to play roles for other players was now demeaned in a way that made class choice less personal/important.
---
Basically, it diminishes the RPG aspect of the game and changes priorities.  If they could have limited dual spec to only work in a PvP scenario, then I don't think I'd have an issue with it, but people switching from DPS to healing/tanking in 5 mans or raids on a whim just felt like crap. 
---
At the end of the day, they had to make content even easier as wrath progressed (and then into cata) to accommodate the new playstyle of people switching to specs they likely suck at.  It was also done in preparation for the LFD tool as we now know.
---
Literally no one has said that in these comments. Why are you trying to create drama out of nothing?
---
Yeah you don't generate rage from attacked when shielded which is important for keeping threat. Never ever preshield tanks, but it can be used in emergencies for what is essentially a instant heal.
---
It released in November 2004
---
I'm just asking to create a discussion. I know what race I'll play.
---
You're just wrong about threat generation. You are always concerned about it, except when you're just entering MC/Ony and your DPS aren't as powerful.
---
Once you get to Naxx your DPS (even when it isn't on farm) are pushing in your tanks threat, and if they aren't then your DPS are slacking, not your Tank.
---
In the later tiers Tanks were having a hell of a time pushing their threat to match their DPS and that is the exact reason you started seeing Fury/Prot theory crafting. The best Tanks in the world were theory crafting ways to increase threat so that their DPS can let loose more.

It is just about always decided by who was there at the formation of a guild and/or is considered extremely trustworthy.  Whether that be RL friends or people who helped make the guild what it became, that is what earns most the right to get these things.

If you joined after the main formation of the guild and took no part in leading, helping people, or doing anything other than being the TOP dps mage, there is no frickin way you will get that staff.

Why is the DPS so low?
---
I‚Äôm very active in the theorycrafting community. If youre properly geared, doing your rotation right in fury you should have literally 0 problems holding aggro. If you are, you need to call for slows more or youre doing something way wrong. You lose threat by going troll and not having tf. Orc is better because of the axe bonus and racial combined
---
Delete this post please.
---
Nobody is going to raid as 21/30, that's a PVP spec. Also, as long as you're using your pet (which you should if you're anywhere close to being competent), then 20/31/0 is better than Lightning Reflexes even at 500 agi.
---
So please explain to the grandpas. What is mountain dew? A new beer?
---
2-4 times a week
---
Well, any guild running naxx40 is likely going to give it to someone who has helped the guild in major ways or was simply there from the formation.  You can be the most prepared mage and the top DPS and you still wouldn't get it if you had no hand in maintaining the guild in any way shape or form.
---
Done this before, great times.
---
Dyatlov would be an amazing guild leader
---
Best explanation I can give is this.
---
Celebrity players receive a lot of assistance from a large community. It makes them prime candidates for say, Scarab Lord, because they could potentially have a full quarter of their entire faction working to make them Scarab Lord while normal players, best case scenario, have a large guild helping them. 
---
It also means that wherever they go will be on LOCKDOWN for the opposing faction because their followers will swarm the area. 
---
Personally? I never dreamed of having Scarab Lord and I've had regular raids lock down areas in the past. I'm not *too* concerned.

Millennials were born around the early 80s to the late 90s-00s, depending on who you ask.
---
This [source](https://worldin2019.economist.com/millennialsvboomers) states the range is from 1981-1996.
---
So yeah, lots of millennials could be 30 or older.
---
Bottom line is that if you actually want to compete against other good players as a DPS warrior, then you will end up looking like a rainbow.  
---
Over time, you can still get tier sets as an off set for tanking, but for DPS?  There is no logic in regards to the visuals.  I would argue that is what gives it a charm though.  To each their own.

Oh, you're right! My bad. However, combat rogues can still test it with sword specialization talent. 5% chance to proc extra attack on auto attack.

Eventually respec costs go up to 50g.  Earning 50g can take 1-3 hours depending on professions and class.. sadly warriors suck at farming in the traditional sense.

Just write something close to it?
---
Funny most theory crafting I see (Including the comments on here and words directly from the mouths in content videos from Main Tanks) all say Troll is the superior race.
---
You're literally the only one saying Orc. Yes I know Orc has axe specialization but you may never hold an axe until halfway through your raid content. Orc is popular yes, but on a pen and paper level Troll &gt; Orc with swords/maces/daggers.
---
Orc is better with an Axe, but that's it.
---
Yup.
---
You do, but I tend to be a serial altoholic anyways. I will probably level my bank alt eventually, and I will certainly level it to 10 to get access to 150 skill potions, which is enough to process oily blackmouth into blackmouth oil, and I THINK to make free action potions, though I cannot say for sure: both classicdb and wowhead profession recipes are messed up and don't show the min skill required  for specific crafts.

You won't be able to make flasks, or anything, but I have no intention of dropping skinning pre 60 on my warrior anyways, and once you are 60, why pick up alchemy when you could pick up engineering? Engineering is a lot more useful for pvp/dungeons.
---
I'll be taking my sweet time and hopefully making a lot of friends along  the months long trip to 60
---
LOL, hell no. give me no changes TBC. Tbc was alot better than classic. You might disagree but if you're getting your no changes classic I also want my no changes TBC.
---
but they were a part of the vanilla experience?
---
Eh, cooking doesnt slow your leveling down almost at all.
---
And if you are lucky. You may never get a bindings drop or it may take a very long time. If you feel you‚Äôve discovered a more optimal way to tank, join us on the theorycrafting discord and explain

---
Thanks for trying, but I think we're only feeding the troll at this point :P
---
So I have always had the whole group roll for it and never had any problems with it. Recently however someone made a point that if we come across a mining node we don‚Äôt roll for that, whoever can mine it gets it. Therefore whoever can unlock the chest should get it. I still think the group should roll on chests but could see how others wouldn‚Äôt
---
Imo leveling mining will be a nightmare at launch and you will quickly outpace your mining skill. Skinning doesnt have that problem.
---
Then you‚Äôre a scrub. The daily‚Äôs in TBC were def NOT necessary. I did daily‚Äôs for reasons other than the gold. The gold wasn‚Äôt even that much from TBC daily‚Äôs. I made tons of gold farming mats, crafting with my professions and flipping them on the AH.
---
We raided 3 nights a week for 2-4 hours a night in retail Vanilla. The guild was the most-progressed Horde guild on my server (Malygos, US) and we cleared all of MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20, AQ40 (minus Ouro), and about 5-6 bosses in Naxx before TBC launched.
---
Bajeera's pretty "chad" that being said. I wasn't really saying their chads. I was mocking the sad little beardlings on here that are acting that way. As they have been told ad nauseam all of the major streamers are going to play on the same server. Literally just pick any other server and the issue is immediately resolved.

Oh jeez.. oh man.. \*sweats\*

I was just making a joke tbh idc about your discussion

you mean types?
---
Meh. It forces you to Marie Condo your bags. Most junk that people have in their bags you don't actually need to be literally carrying around at all times, especially as a mage with Teleport. 
---
Then once all the water/food is handed out it's like... look at how much room there is for activities
---
Thanks. Hoping that 2 nights a week will be fairly common. I have a son, so priorities and all that.

---
For those that want to participate in PVE content, we are looking for committed players that are able to raid 3 days a week. We don‚Äôt require any private server or past experience, but we do require that you will attempt in obtaining most of your pre raid BIS and a willingness to research and learn your class as well as the tactics to each boss fight.

---
Literally never once in my life saw VC before I played on 2019 Pservers. DM is deadmines. DME/DMN/etc was dire maul.
---
&gt; 2-4 hours each time.
---
Unless they changed it from what it was in Vanilla then yes, you are auto flagged the moment you step into those zones.
---
If not then you would see A LOT of Horde and Alliance just hanging out outside of SW and Org.
---
It would ruin the immersion of the story and game if you had naked orcs dancing in Goldshire.
---
Yeah, but I don't think you need any specific skill to do that. you could very much just wait for level 35 and then drop herbalism for enchanting if you wanted to do that route. And I don't THINK (but I really know nothing about enchanting) that you get skillups from disenchanting in vanilla, right? 
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to not carry around enchanting mats in your bags, not put on .5 stamina bracer enchants at level 10, and  then once you hit level 35 and the enchanting mats aren't worthless any more, you can start actually disenchanting then? 
---
I am by no means committed to herbalism for the long haul, I will probably play it by ear and reevaluate as necessary. But I see little reason to go enchanting pre about 35, unless I am missing something.
---
Yeah I remember joining many more MC / ZG pugs and guild runs than any other but alt runs will be for whatever is the highest/quickest clear at the time.
---
And that's purely solo - guilds will be much more active (at least I believe so) plenty of people will want to level and gear alts since we aren't guaranteed to move to TBC (hopefully not)
---
I imagine a populated server will have plenty of raids going every day.
---
Not too bad then
---
The time Naxx hit most of us had at least 2 alts for Split/Alt raiding alts ofc only MC/BWL etc but yeah it was about 4 Nights a week of repeated death and corpseruns then rebuffing and getting slapped around again in Naxx xD Oh and ofc all those days grinding on prenerf C'thun cuz yeah he just gotta HAS to die sometime right?
---
You could definitely have classic players born from a vanilla marriage/hookup.
---
Is WoW more cpu or gpu reliant? Curious cause I recently upgraded to a Ryzen 5 2600 but still using my gtx 970
---
Imagine a game that has to TELL YOU you have achieved something. Lol.
---
We would clear BWL in \~2 hrs, and then AQ40 in \~2 hours. Next night, we'd head to Naxx.
---
So \~8 hours a week. We stopped doing MC and ZG with regularity after a few months.

When you just need to learn your new bandages but someone's doing this quest so you have to wait.
---
True, AV is a year out probably. Its possible if the community is heavily in favor of pre Nerf version then maybe they'll do it
---
Warriors were oversaturated in vanilla as well.  Nothing will be any different in classic.  
---
As for priests?  Raids can fit in a lot of those lol
---
I mean, you're pointing out the low hanging fruit that is easy to change and fix. There is a very popular private server built on the idea of pvp to loot other people's gear and it is the most fun ive had in wow ever.
---
BC. Very relevant for Kara.
---
That‚Äôs pretty good, wouldn‚Äôt mind messing around in MC/BWL on an alt.
---
If you‚Äôve discovered something unknown or more optimal, please come explain it to the theorycrafting discord. Dw fury orc is better than troll fullstop, unless the troll has tf
---
With only 9 classes in the game, everything is gonna be crowded :)
---
I have an ultrawide monitor and it works great. You need to modify your interface because you can't see the UI.  What's the monitor?
---
Lol. I hope to level an alt in vanilla/classic. Not sure what yet though.
---
major areas of the map will be missing too...east and west sides
---
Shamans are easily the best Multi target healers.
---
The mind sees what it chooses to see.
---
Defense Cap isn't super important in vanilla. Most content is balanced around not having it. It's a bonus not a requirement 
---
The taunt is the biggest issue, but they still make fantastic off tanks, especially for multiple mobs aka trash
---
My guild had some off tank pallys , but they were low priority
---
Literally no one cares.
---
Size isn't what matters, it's the enthusiasm...err, resolution.  What is the resolution?
---
What is your memory like of raid comps during progression?
---
I never noticed this before, but at 1:12 how does he have Death Wish?
---
Were crits in endgame vanilla really that big? This guy is constantly critting for 2.5k at 60. I remember critting for 3k in Karazhan at 70...
---
I mained a warrior and a priest in Vanilla : this is very simple, you never shield a warrior (or a bear druid I guess) unless he's going to die.
---
If he was going to die and complains about the shield he's an idiot (that doesn't deserve you).
---
While you're at it, don't pre-hot the tank before the pull or heal him too early at the beginning of the fight : he didn't generate any threat but your hot / heal is generating threat on every mob and now the tank has to scramble to get back everybody in line.
---
The game (at least the PVE part) is a piece of cake once everybody understand threat and care about it.
---
&gt; But because autistic 12 year old
---
Ah yes, i can relate to this no-hate criticism
---
Isn't that just a small scale eve online?
---
Yeah Shadowpriests whole gimmic is that they are really good at duels same with Warlock
---
It seems like everyone is upset because they are automatically assuming that Soda and the other streamers are going to be blacklisting anyone for the smallest reasons.
---
It's pretty easy to determine when someone is actively stream sniping you and consistently harassing you. I have faith that they wont just be blacklisting people who stumble upon them and kill them once. Either way, we wont know until it happens, so the preemptive rage probably needs to stop.
---
Definitely rolling Alliance. This is my nostalgia kick right here! I leveled horse on classic, but never past 20. Definitely going to make some horse Alts. My main will be Alliance tho
---
The problem hunters have is that their base damage is good, but they scale poorly. They are like reverse warriors, who only scale but have no base, so they go crazy toward the end but start out as complete shit during leveling and before you get gear at 60.
---
During the early parts hunters are fine, and toward naxx they are borderline dead weight, brought for tranq shot and to not waste loot.
---
In PvP they fall off a bit as well, but not as bad.
---
This is from a somewhat hardcore perspective, but keep in mind if you're not somewhat serious, you're probably not going to naxx at all, because you need a big time investment to even get that progressed.
---
If you want to play hunter, do it, but if you look at videos of *fast* (not regular, though they're not that different) naxx40 runs from private servers they have like 2 hunters. Otoh, it tends to be impopular at that level of play anyway, so not that much competition.
---
Can this be pinned please
---
There's a [talent](https://i.imgur.com/MhESyI8.png) that does that in the holy tree
---
If you raided, you could be a god in pvp. I remember a rogue friend who was in a Naxx progression guild. He could easily 1v4 dudes in bg‚Äôs. Also if you try hard your efforts are rewarded. Pots/eng are all usuable in bg‚Äôs which can add some flair to your gameplay. For me personally I liked pvp because i was a 13 year old rogue gnome who didn‚Äôt have time to pve lol

Get a turtle, personal little armored tank
---
That's the entire point of that thread
---
What you did was shoehorned it in the laziest possible way into an unrelated thread
---
Saying it's what you're excited about is a papers thin excuse that everyone can see through - that's why everyone is jumping down your throat. You're just being asshole and defending indefensible behavior with faulty logic.
---
When Chuck Norris donates blood he declines the needle.  Instead, he requests a Glock and a bucket.
---
Trying out Shaman tanking with my friends and going back to windfurying people in bgs.
---
Lmao. By making "your voice heard" you perpetuate the thing you hate. Nice self defeating behavior.
---
The fact that we dont only have 2 years time now to play vanilla.
---
It weirdly enough just relaxes me, knowing you can take the time you need with the game.
---
Bait
---
Once you're questing in the Barrens, there's a good 2 handed axe to be had in the quest chain about killing the harpies to the north-west.
---
I think you can get it around lvl 16, but might be tough to solo as a warrior.
---
IIRC the NPC that gives the quest is on the tower in XROAD.
---
In 2005, I was running vanilla on a PC with a 256MB graphics card, a 6GB hard drive, and a single core processor.  As I understand it, Classic will have slightly higher requirements. But I'd be surprised if you couldn't play it smoothly.
---
Anyone know if blizzard will offer faction, race or realm change for $$ in classic?
---
/sit exploit?
---
They are as they always were. Faction specific
---
49 inches thats all that matters
---
That's how I remember it as well.
---
Do you know what that server's population is?
---
Yah, you get honor for participating in any way. That includes being grouped or healing. (Conversely, if someone in your group gets a DIShonorable kill, then you will LOSE honor for it, even if you did nothing in the fight.)
---
You‚Äôre right
---
Not just rp pvpers but everyone who doesnt want to be on a major streamer server should find their servers, and pick and claim another one and overwhelm the population with like minded people. We have ways to organize without twitch you people know
---
Yup been playing on PServer just to help figure out my route as Alliance.  Been following Joanas guide and have found 2 big changes I'd make so far, for sure fuck Stonetalon as alliance.
---
Maybe they are on EU servers. WoW didn‚Äôt release there till Feb 2005
---
Appreciate it! üíô
---
During Vanilla we raided 3-4 nights a week @ 3-4 hours each raid. We were a semi-hardcore guild that cleared all but Cthun and about half of Naxx.
---
On Pservers we raid 2 nights a week @ 1-2 hours each raid. We were a hardcore speedrunning guild that cleared everything week one.
---
The raiding schedules of old don‚Äôt matter.
---
Edit: As someone more aware than me pointed out, Trash Blade is not available at the moment. 
---
However, the issue or question at hand can still be tested by a combat rogue or arms warrior with sword specialization.
---
How else should I be?
---
BuT iF yOu DoN't LiKe ThEm JuSt DoN't Do ThEm

You could run this game smoothly on a PC that's over 20 years old. You're good.
---
This is what I've been looking at. Do you have any suggestions?

---
You are the worst shaman ive ever heard of
---
Yep, Elwynn, Durotar, Tirisfal Glades, The Barrens, etc. are considered neutral, so there is no autoflagging. Only entering cities and even small villages of the opposite faction flag a player. And I remember being flagged when a guard saw me.
---
I dont have a plan or route or guide. I'm just going to quest and kill monsters and shit. Probably pick up herbalism and not sure what my second profession will be. Maybe tailor like I did back in the day, maybe enchanting. 
---
Going to get off of work early and hop on and take the rest of the week off though.
---
Me!!
---
No fucking way, hunters are mostly a "support" class that has a lot of responsibilty in encounters, they also don't have that great DPS after a whle.
---
I would bet on rogues/mages being most played.
---
In TBC however, everyone and their mom will reroll into Hunter
---
&gt; you also get flagged when buffing a PvP flagged person of your own faction
---
It's true. Buffing, healing or ressurecting a PvP flagged person makes a player flagged too.
---
Druid will probably be the least played class in the game. You either have to compete with warriors in tanking or be the only resto Druid in the whole raid.
---
It actually released in EU in feb 2005. It released in 2004 for NA
---
I played since day 1 vanilla release and it's pretty similar to what he said, honestly. He calls it empty and uncontested and yet I find what he describes is authentic to what I experienced.
---
The dailies were. But you can just replace dailies with a reputation source that isn't timegated
---
I‚Äôve been playing the beta on both my pc and MacBook Air, it runs smooth on both so I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have any problems come classic!
---
I prefer no flying, but to play devil's advocate: even with ground mounts, if you can poly/root/whatever and exit combat to mount up, you get away anyway since you're ahead of them on the mount. So that doesn't make a difference.
---
That‚Äôs what I said?
---
can't wait for the dreadnaught!
---
Oversaturated for 5 mans, but raids will have a bazillion warriors.
---
there are videos of fury duel wield tanks in naxx, its really not that hard
---
\#nochanges people are toxic because their arguments makes absolutely no sense. Blizzard has already made tons of changes and they keep pretending like nothing happened and keeps spewing their bullshit phrase all over the place.
---
RNG was on your side that day
---
We were pretty heavy on melee DPS (Rogue, Warrior). Tried to get one Shaman in each party of melee DPS + tank party. Always short on healers. Only main tanks we used were Warriors. Occasionally Druid off-tanks or for older content. Never any Shaman tanks.
---
Honor Buddy
---
That was my experience as well; tons of lag and disconnected repeatedly.
---
&gt; 5 people playing 1 char each will often be better/richer per person than one guy trying to control 5 chars
---
Of course 5 people are. So a multiboxer is only 4 times richer than usual player. Ok, fair enough.
---
The reason why hunters are a better farming class is due to the quality of the pets-they have more utility and the beast mastery tree improves them significantly. 
---
Now when it
---
It wasn't about dire maul entirely...  It was about the quest that led people into their first instance on alliance.  
---
Even before dire maul was a thing, everyone called the run "VC".
---
Ive never experienced actual people of authority like guild officers and such get toxic over racials. From my experience people would invite both min maxers and non, but they would try to get the min maxers first. 
---
There will be priorities and there is NOTHING wrong with that. I feel like a lot of carefree players get offended when you say that. Apparently people here are around 30 but still cant handle that people have preferences. You just have the bite the sour apple and accept that.
---
Be damned if you do, be damned if you dont. Just play the way you want to and ignore the people that try to put you down for it. That goes for both sides. There will always be toxic idiots. Do you really truly care if some redditor says you're not allowed to play in a certain way lol? Who cares about their opinion? Do what feels right to you.
---
Like most, I'm really torn on which class to roll.
---
**Warrior** \- I really love tanking, the easy dungeon groups is also a massive bonus. I'm concerned I'll be super gimp anytime I want to do solo content, however. 10000+ Warriors on the server might also make it hard to find a guild.
---
**Hunter -** Probably my number 1 favourite class from Vanilla. It has a really high skill cap. My main concern is not being able to find dungeon groups as a DPS. I don't have 50+ hours each week to play. If I can log in and do two dungeons on my warrior in 3.5 hours vs only one on a hunter then it's not great. Good at solo content is a bonus.
---
Who cares if they got priority for beta keys? It makes sense. If I ran blizzard it's exactly how I would have done it. It's free marketing.
---
Amazing. A real challenge might be all the challenge mode sets too. They look amazing.
---
Yeah, pretty much; I guess the main difference would be that scamming wouldn‚Äôt be a legitimate strat in that version of WoW.
---
Don't remember it being a thing until dm release on my server.
---
Can be tested in beta using Sword Specialisation.
---
Yes, but they ban bots/goldsellers, even those paying sub fee, because it's unhealthy for the game. I'd argue that multiboxing is quite unhealthy as well.
---
Here we go, private server chimes in...
---
*cries in enhancement*
---
I'm afraid it might become widespread thanks to WoW tokens. Can imagine some people having quite a few, so they can multibox without paying ridiculous $$.
---
that is what I don't get lol.. I like to play on a pserver right now and it's fun.
---
From my experience mage seems to get the most mileage if you have engineering and good pvp trinkets. 
---
Warriors are extremely gear dependent and benefit the most from the best pieces in the current phase.
---
If I don't remember it wrong we aren't going to have like 12-24 hours Alteracs, but it can still take upwards to 3hours so I'd say there is a pretty fair chance to see cavalry, air marshals, and the forest/ice lords
---
I will for when I solo elites at max level !
---
Yup, so basically just decline duels
---
No I'm totally with you on not running alch on the main (unless you intend to never level an alt to any reasonable level). I mostly just wanted to confirm my memory on that restriction. 
---
I have bounced between what class I want to main like 90 times so far, and I still haven't landed. But I just leveled a warrior with mining/BS on a Wrath pserver and it was goddamn awful until level 78. I was consistently out-gearing anything I could craft, and it just felt like such a massive time suck for minimal reward. I realize the fact that I had no need for level 60 crafted gear plays a part in my judgment of it, but even the MINING was painful. Competition for nodes, constantly be ready to move on to a new zone but needing to stick around until my mining was leveled up enough, etc. 
---
It just felt super clunky when you need 900 ore to level BS to a given level, but like 1/10th of that to get mining up. So you need a ton of mithril but you're not running into mithril organically. And by the time you hit a zone that has it, you're wearing far superior gear than what you can craft. 
---
Maybe I did something wrong, but it just felt like such a terrible use of time and effort. 
---
Can't wait to do it all over but put the mats into engineering :)
---
Dwarf
---
Farming what exactly? Profession mats? Specifically mob drops like cloth?
---
A 100m dash but every 20m you have to wait for everyone. Yeah that seems popular
---
I thought they eventually lifted the limit?
---
If you need to ask you will never get HWL/GM
---
It was added in WotLK, as far as I remember.
---
They do not have population totals listed anywhere, but there are 8500 people currently online who are on their discord server. Id imagine the number of players is fairly high. They have made significant changes to pvp works, and to fix your issue, at level 60 you gain nothing from fighting anyone 59 or lower.
---
You forget that the multiboxer also has 5 chars to gear.
---
So if 5 players play together and earn 100 gold, the boxer with his 5 chars would maybe make 70-80 gold in the same time, while still have the same needs for EQ etc.
---
Meaning that playing multiple chars yourself is only useful if the servers are too empty to find a group; something that, hopefully, won't happen for a very long time.
---
You are wrong. Every leveling zone bellow lvl 15 are ennemy terriorie you get auto flagged.you cant attack but anyone could attack you and then when they do you can attack them too i dont know for how long but they are gonna be flagged
---
Iirc from raiding as late as tbc , pre pull pws was potential screwup as it would ragestarve tank during the pull and mess up with his initial threat rotation. Missdirection would help combat this issue tho,however my initial rotation for healing the mt would be cast renew as he takes first hit,followed by big heal and then bubble
---
GAWD... WHAT A FUCKING GRIEFER, SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERMA BAN AND BLACKLISTED FOR THAT^^^^^^^/s
---
The owners of wowhead (ZAM network, now called fanbyte) used to own IGE, which sold MMO currency and such. IGE no longer exists, so on paper they no longer have any connection to RMT. If you want to tinfoil hat it up, they could still be doing it on the side, but I think it's a little unfair to say the owners of wowhead are all about RMT.
---
This info is straight from Wikipedia fwiw.
---
&gt;dinging 40 and getting your warhorse
---
You must be a paladin or warlock.
---
You‚Äôre delusional if you don‚Äôt think private server players aren‚Äôt more knowledgeable and more experienced and more relevant than all the other people who haven‚Äôt touched the game in 15 years combined.
---
But you could run into someone else who could dismount you, which isn't as true if you fly straight up.  Niche difference, and assumes another player, and someone *could* polymorph+slowfall or similar, but there is definitely a different feel.
---
Still though, really good point.
---
nice
---
Who said any of that was a waste!? Sounds like fun to me :)
---
Night elf isn't really useless. Shadowmeld for one is a unique and usefuk racial. Also starshards is technically the most mana efficient sine target damage spell a priest has.
---
It was a lot of fun during Vanilla! Had a good community.
---
Play retail lol
---
Until AQ we raided once a week, we had a 2nd raid on BWL launch, and ofc sometimes you have to do onyxia twice. With AQ with had to do 2 raid 40man raid per week for a month or two until we could do all of it in one evening. For naxx we quit all other raids and did 3 raids to progress it. 
---
Was an experienced guild though one of the best on the server. And then there was 20man which was twice a week (skipped some resets because fuck me those raids are boring), some tanks basically organized when they would clear and you could just sign up for whenever. Sometimes we did double ZG after raid if there was time.
---
The system that blizzard put in place in order to make certain changes to the classic system just in case a majority of players have burned out on the classic effort to reward model, that relies on time gated content. As far as I'm concerned that was blizzard saying, even in classic we saw how many players burned out by the end of classic because they have absolutely no self-control and cannot do anything in moderation so we are going to build into the game A system that tries to moderate how much players play every day, to progress, the daily Quest system.
---
Or maybe not. But if players could grind out in the entire reputation in one day it would be burning out a lot faster. I honestly like that blizzard tried many different time gating things because I know I am an irresponsible as hell player who has no concept of what moderation means. It's not unlike classic. It's almost a familiar safe warm fun feeling to have specific older restrictions put on us again. The same will be true for burning Crusade and the beginning I think eventually controlled time gated content like dailies.
---
Besides, many of us who are feeling sour about dailies now are not feeling that way only because we are remembering what it was like in burning Crusade. We are remembering what it was like in burning Crusade and all the expansions after where we always hit maximum level and always had to do dailies or so we felt. But after 24 months in classic many of us will be ready and look forward again to the progression that daily quests offers. It's basic tolerance, you stop doing something for a while and the next time you do it you will have more fun doing it.
---
If this is a reboot of 2006 WoW why would it need beta testers?

This. I always loved the launch of expansions where you got a mini version of this. But stoked to log on and the highest level person will be like 4 and not a single soul has anything but white items.
---
Orcs + troll area should be worse than Sepulcher
---
Just lock your exp at 60 on retail and play LFD all day.
---
Me me me.
---
You get it
---
Gearing is another story. He can only focus on their main and let the others simply be his green nuke team.
---
&gt;So if 5 players play together and earn 100 gold
---
Then each of them gets 20, while multiboxer gets 70-80.
---
As a priest, it‚Äôs not a smart option compared to having fear ward which is insane. 
---
Shadowmeld in vanilla isn‚Äôt amazing either, lots of people forget that it is a 10 second cooldown and it is NOT usable in combat. 
---
Night elf in BFA, is NUTS that‚Äôs what my 2.1k Druid main is
---
Wow...so toxic
---
The reason why hunters are a better farming class is due to their pets. They have a better ability to deal and take damage and the beast mastery tree improves them significantly.
---
Now when it comes to end game it really depends on your end goal and the guild your joining. A hunter will be needed-period. The game is designed that way so hunters are needed in some encounters due to tranq shot -its also not 2006/2007 anymore so I doubt guilds will be trying to min max by swapping out hunters for non tranq fights.
---
With hunters, after T2 they don't scale very well with gear so don't expect the crazy damage upgrades other classes get. Caster classes like warlocks/mages do really well though. The additional spell power, spell penetration, hit/crit make a world of difference. It will really depend on your self on what class you'd rather play as the playstyle is completely different -its hard to say what class will be needed on a server without the server being released yet.
---
Lmao u nuts
---
Daily anything was a bad choice for wow for this exact reason. Before you do anything don't forget to repeat the same 20 quests for the 100th time.
---
lol does this nerd keep getting banned?
---
This statement seriously confounds me. It was VC on my realm (Deathwing) from pretty much the point dire maul came out to avoid confusion I guess, which was like a few months after the launch of the game. Sure people would say DM occasionally but most referred to it as VC.
---
IGE definitely still exists, wowhead just claims to have no affiliation.
---
on top of shoulders i also had SO much hype for getting my first super-long cloak... once i had shoulders plus a long cloak, i knew my character was now a serious badass
---
You should do another mage.
---
In fact 2 more mages, never have to respec!
---
This is good
---
Hated them in both TBC and WoTLK. I'dd much rather just grind furbolgs at my own pace rather than feel like I'm delaying exalted rep because I was away for 1 day. I think it was a big reason I stopped playing in both those expansions.
---
how about 4 core loot council + 4 rotating guildies each raid, never the same guildie until the entire raid roster had a chance on council?
---
Here's a toast to the our fortune of having played during those two brief eras of the game. Phenomenal stuff.
---
If you have 5 kids maybe don‚Äôt play any video games.
---
I agree with both of those sentiments.
---
Please dont show me your weird hands ever again.
---
Yay another copy paste!
---
Lmao this guy has issues. Go play something else we don‚Äôt want you in the community
---
I adore all the things you listed
---
1.;The community is so important. While there are gonna be a few shitheads, most of them are going to filter out quickly or adjust their behavior. You can bet the people creating all the drama right now or feeding into it are probably not going to last - anti social behavior like that gets you shunned. If they do last, they'll probably learn to be more low key. Some of my fondest memories of vanilla are from grouping up with randoms on my server, and having such a fun time with them that we became friends throughout the game, grouping together frequently and competing. That's just not possible in retail wow right now. The ONLY cross server thing I actually like is cross server BGS - you can't actually speak to the opposing team so it doesn't matter if they're not from your server, the rest of your team is. The beginning of the end of community in wow started with global chats and the LFG system, and I'm glad the LFG system is a wrath thing that won't show up
---
2. I feel like it's hard to put into words how much I love vanilla's itemization. The items weren't all numerically optimized for your class. They were cool, unique items that had stats that while not "optimal", still benefited you. You didn't care so much that your weapon had spirit on it as a warrior - it still helped you a little bit. Going Fury and wearing leather made you feel like you were dedicated to your class. You wanted that crit and hit enough to sacrifice armor, it made you feel like you were committed to your role as a dps. Plus, you wouldn't really get hit anyway. 
---
Sometimes it was cool to have a little intelligence - your int was so low that the small boost from one piece made you feel like it helped level your weapon skill. I know I hoarded some int gear for when I needed to level my weapon skill. I use to throw that stuff on, then go to SM to level the new mace or dagger I got - there was a self healing mob that there i could slap for a long long time to level my weapons.
---
All the little trade offs you had to make for your gear in classic actually really improved the experience. Plate felt defensive. Leather felt aggressive. Cloth felt casty. It had such a cool feeling. You used whatever was good for you, regardless if it was "optimal".
---
3. Spell batching allowed for some really cool things. Seeing two mages pollymorph each other was hilarious
---
I haven't even decided on what my main character is going to be never mind my alt.
---
First Aid got merged into Tailoring, so it wasn't totally removed.
---
One for food one for water
---
As far as I know they will support all resolutions so even if you're monitors optimal resolution is 4k or 8k or whatever you can play WoW on it.
---
streamers good, community bad
---
I never really got into watching streamers because I‚Äôm old and would rather play a game,  but I‚Äôve heard of some streamers bitching because someone is watching their stream and then killing them in game. This is apparently a bannable offense in some games and I think that‚Äôs stupid. If someone is showing their game they are asking for it.
---
Plus I‚Äôve seen a lot of stupid drama on Reddit between streamers. Plus I‚Äôm fairly certain all those YouTube blanket copy write problem is probably just some of the more popular streamers keeping the less popular streamers from getting popular.
---
The 5 guys can do the same, make one of them OP and have the rest nuke.
---
Everything a multiboxer does, a group of people can do better, if they want to. The only reason to use a box is if you can't find friends to agree on a plan.
---
Inc lvl 60 and mc clears on beta.
---
Why are you so butthurt over this? Y‚Äôall are redic. It‚Äôs some random reddit thread, aint rly a big deal
---
Hi, /u/Bestoftherest222
---
fuck streamers
---
I still have some minor form of PTSD relating to the quel'danas dailies. It was after getting exalted with them that I pretty much swore of daily quests or rep grinds from that point on. Wrath, Cata, Mop, Dreanor, Legion, etc. I never do dailies anymore, and it hurts my progression pretty immensely.

---
The guy I trust for reviews. Hope you got a kick ass graphic card to run all those pixels.
---
So to sum up you are playing a shaman and complaining about warlock's sac shield?
---
First, you should open your spell book and go the letter "p". Tell me what spell you see there.
---
I know you wanted to say more but stopped reading at this point. Cba these people. Please play Bfa if you want "balance".
---
It's not like going from darkshore to lochmodan and back. Stonetalon, Ashenvale and Dakrshore are all close to one another, and it actually makes the most sense from 20 to 04.
---
Once server lists drop there will probably be a lot of that going on.
---
Me and a couple of friends are going to play on a pvp EU realm. I kinda want to find a guild for us all to join. I have been looking here https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq ,  maybe you will find something aswell. Maybe we will find ourselves on the same realm. /wave
---
Streamer's fanboys usualyl aren't skilled enough to carry, specially for pvp
---
Making a mage first so i can farm gold and hopefully get one of the rare Enchanting patterns early so i can make a ton of gold. I'll use this gold to funnel into a warrior so i can grind to 60 without wanting to kill myself.
---
it's more or less a twitch meme at this point, you've got twitch'ed
---
That wouldn't work in WoW though really would it
---
Yeah, world pvp is more of a "I can keep doing this until you get tired of it and leave" situation.
---
You can also slowly walk him over to allied NPCs, or have your wife fly in from ironforge to kill whoever it is for you. I've done both of those!
---
I don't have this method because it's slower, but the hill just as you discover gnomeragan is easily climbable. Stay on top of the white mountains while going north, till you see a huge gap and brown mountains below. Suicide there, and rez.
---
I mained priest in vanilla. I started every pull that mattered with pw:s renew the sit and drink and the party was on their own a moment while I mana up
---
Glad ill be on an oceanic server, away from the streamers.
---
Main as a rogue and a mage alt üòÅ
---
Yeah, I have two kids and could not disagree more with you. No one is forcing you to play classic and if the playstyle doesn't match your time commitment then I guess you can play only small amounts or find a different game to play.
---
Totally possible, in Naxx on my Rogue (fully buffed) I was doing 1k white melee crits (with a one hander).
---
So a fully decked 2h warrior with buffs (+abilities) can easily crit 2k+ on clothies.
---
But Its not about just the shield? Did you even pay attention, their damage output is insanely more powerful than anything a mage and shaman could produce with BIS gear. So before you go ahead with your "I cba, bfa" incel nonsense read.
---
7 is my record aswell, been doing those hops alot
---
Thank you! I really appreciate it!
---
Wowhead *aren't* really affiliated, though, it's not really a claim.
---
Wowhead is owned by fanbyte, fanbyte is owned by Affinity Media. Affinity previously owned IGE, but no longer hold a stake.
---
So if you believe there are shady backroom deals still going on, that's your personal theory, not anything that's actual fact, unless you have a source for this
---
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
Nice now I don't have to talk to people about where to find things :-)
---
This will never happen.
---
Just be informed where streamers start to play, avoid those servers? How hard is that?
---
You could /sit and force the mob to crit you, which activates the enrage proc from talent points (warrior). Basically you had a crazy strong buff that you could get on demand every fight. This exploit will not be possible in classic.
---
I feel like frostfire would be cool even with a blank hole in the face :)
---
Well I started trying to reason with them and they just acted like kids so I then I called them 12 year olds. Now they spaz out so I call them autistic 12 year olds. 
---
If they didn't act like autistic 12 year olds and actually accepted that different people have different tastes then we wouldn't have these problems.
---
A less funny joke.
---
I hate to be that guy but all ‚Äúprogress‚Äù on regular WoW is irrelevant too. It‚Äôs about the joy of playing the game.
---
"Click to summon the MT so we can get started!" 
---
\*casts portal to Orgrimmar.
---
49" inch widescreen yeah no thanks, unless you're using it in a living room? If it's on a desk I'd run wow windowed and have browser/discord off to the side, you're not gaining anything by running wow in ultra wide ratio.
---
Certainly not nowadays. Warrior will be #1 then mage then rogue. We will also definitely be seeing a lot more warlocks this time around
---
I've been using this for Classic:
---
 [https://unreasonablereviews.com/philips-499p9h-review/](https://unreasonablereviews.com/philips-499p9h-review/)   
---
I prefer to split the panel into two sides, one for maps/quests, and the other side for the game. But you can actually do a lot of customization on a screen sized like this.
---
Average player is average at pvp but a good to great player is God tier at pvp. 
---
And we all know how raiding goes at this point lol
---
Since I posted that I've been looking at the alienware aw3418dw. I agree I think the 49" is a bit too much.
---
P server guilds have cleared MC in greens on the first lockout in the past... I‚Äôll be interested to see if any guilds pull that off in Classic
---
All wait and no play makes Jack post memes
---
Fuck that, I will not let my kids dictate what I can or cannot do. This is MY life and I can do whatever I want.
---
Just FYI private servers are harder than the beta. I've played both and the beta is a lot easier. The world is still dangerous of course, but private servers have turned it up a notch.
---
Uh, back in my day we only communicated by banging rocks and sticks against cave walls after a good ol' mammoth hunt.
---
Twitch bad, leddit good. Uphipsters to the left.
---
&gt; but der waz no such thing as dps warrioz in vanilla
---
I plan on rolling on a PvP server, as I did in Vanilla. I'm hoping it'll be RP-PvP, but if not? That's fine. Myself and a few friends plan to RP regardless of what server we're on as it's fun and the reaction from non-rpers can be amazing to work with.  
---
I remember people simply stopping to watch when I'd RP with friends on Maelstrom. I typed out that terrible troll accent and everything as I had a Troll Shaman.  
---
On WRA, you'd find people wandering about slowly. Making the rounds or hanging in the Pig and Whistle. Remember having my Guild slow walk on our mounts to a section of Duskwood to put someone ICly on trial. We gained a few tag-alongs because of that. Another time we took down the green dragon there and a lowbie warrior watched. He freaked out ICly and we all had to calm him down as he'd just seen a dragon and we had killed it all on our own! He later became a Guild member and good friend. I'd also hang out in Redridge and pass out bags to lowbies ICly. Some would take the bag and run, others would thank me and sit for a bit of a chat.  
---
Plan to do about the same come Classic.
---
Please do the dreamwalker set on a night elf!
---
&gt; I am not sure why you think that would lead to more min maxing though.
---
I guess I meant that people already know what and when content is coming, so they are going to prepare and make all the content that MUCH MORE trivial. AQ gates if you start saving from the get go will be ridiculous for instance.
---
I managed to get the horde one to spawn as recent as cataclysm. But not since. Though I blame that on me simply not playing enough since.
---
Really interesting point.  It's gonna be pretty fucking lame if all the scarab lord's are just streamers who got people to donate materials.
---
Good troll, üòé
---
Renew is fine, and is more mana efficient than PW:S or if it saves a flash heal (since it "slows" the damage via healing ticks). PW:S on a Warrior/Druid is annoying, particularly as everyone's gear increases. I have done it on dual wield tanks because the majority of their rage is from smashing stuff in the face rather than incoming damage (which will be higher anyway without a shield).    
---
The whole cast/sit thing is fine if your runs move that slowly. In Strat 45 you really aren't standing still most pulls.
---
Bayer might not have anything to do with Nazism today, but it owes its success to its affiliation with Nazi Germany from the past.
---
Wowhead can claim not to have an affiliation, but it still has Chinese gold farmer blood on its hands.
---
Stupid troll
---
As a warrior? I doubt it.
---
31/8/12? What kind of joke build is that. No imp sap, no imp sprint, no preparation, can't even max out Ambush Crit if you wanted to and without Dirty Deeds + Initiative you will never want to open with CS.  
---
How gimmicky is that, Ambush &gt; Backstab and if your opponent survives you die. Nice for WPvP when you're stalking weak prey but not duels or premades.
---
Scary shit! I was under the impression though that greens in TBC were massively better than even top items from vanilla (other than stuff that had powerful effects, like Thunderfury, which lasts even into Karazhan AFAIK). It would imply that only 70 heroics would provide better gear than Naxxramas gear if lvl 70 heroic players were only dealing a bit more damage? Then again, IIRC my memory of "critting for 3k" wasn't actually me but a warlock in my guild who was shocked / hyped at the fact. How much do warlocks crit at the top of vanilla, any guess?
---
To complete what the guy said, you still get crit when you sit on live, but it doesn't proc enrage/reckoning/etc...
---
A nice thing with spell batching though, is that if you stand up at the moment you get hit, it works. I don't think it will really be used as nobody wants to spam /sit during leveling but who knows.
---
Are you aware of layering? Yes total players per server will be higher, but the number of people on your layer will be way lower than the population of fresh private server launches (12k+ in some cases). If people can get ahead of the curve with 12k pop on a p server release they will easily get ahead with 2-3k pop on Classic release, or whatever blizzard decides to cap the layer at.
---
My man really just ran around the whole time.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/tz3QwQh.png](https://i.imgur.com/tz3QwQh.png)
---
So, less than the 14k cap of most popular pservers launch.
---
We had two main raid days, Wednesday and Sunday 4 hours each, and two raid days for Onyxia and Zul Gurub, just as long as we need
---
And i wouldn't have it any other way, 2.0 barrens chat is a near perfect recreation
---
Yo Normund, I have a few more but lost alot of my screen grabs :D will have a look at somepoint
---
I feel both are fine for beginers maybe mage might be easier by a 10th of a mm if that makes sense
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
I thought aesthetics were the best reason *to* roll orc. Alliance has always been jealous of our enormous shoulders.
---
I started playing during BC! I‚Äôm sure Vanilla was a bit better, but the community aspect was definitely still there on the horde side of the server
---
lol, whatever dude
---
back in the day with cherry picked agility gear the 21/30 spec just scales too good and spanks the llama's ass on the dmg meter in PvE and PvP
---
What does being a warrior have to do with making money from professions?
---
Oh Man! I loved those comics they used to lighten my day no end!
---
True, but all in all it still is quite the same a if the server was capped at 2 or 3k, competition wise.
---
Honestly it's not as bad as you think, warriors are the hardest class to level (followed by rogues), and extremely gear dependent , so expect a lot of warriors to give up and reroll hunters .
---
but there's definitely going to be a lot of mages.. like a lot
---
You didn‚Äôt play warrior, obviously. They were by far the slowest and least efficient farmers in the game.
---
Warlock Tier 3 was the GOD tier dont lie to yourselfs :D
---
Always a troll mage. In every sense of the words.
---
That‚Äôs not how layering works... what you described is more like sharding.
---
Yes, this is by far my #1 wish for the site as is, but I use this more than any other site for Classic so I am very grateful for your work. The fact that you‚Äôre not monetizing it at all is very noble and I hope you get what you‚Äôre seeking out of this project.
---
Maybe you just don‚Äôt know how to play
---
I used to have a lot of fun with the boar‚Äôs charge in pvp. Good pet control would allow for a timely charge to give you a chance to gain some distance.
---
using pets in raid encounters mostly get them killed.
---
A healer or a tank have the most responsibility in a group so I wouldnt go healer if you are worried about not performing well. 
---
I would go mage. Their kit is super fun and even if you dont play them to their full potential you will still do well in a group. Their playstyle is pretty intuitive, cast spells at people, dont let them hit you.
---
Can confirm, also you're the first other person I've seen from Bonechewer!
---
I thought it was 99 silver. I made a ticket and the GM told me sucks to suck. I cried lol.
---
Yeah, but it's the same for mob competition.
---
My fianc√© felt that mage was the best starting class, with that being said if you dislike the idea of healing I would suggest mage. 
---
Though if your friend goes paladin or warrior, finding groups for 5 mans would be super easy as a priest.
---
Asmon makes more money than you ever will, bitch.
---
Someone already said it
---
Anti streamer circle jerk man children
---
IIRC Blizz said about 3k population per 'layer' - which was less than that fresh launch had. Admittedly there was dynamic respawns though.
---
Found You Norm! check my other posts.
---
Eve is dead*
---
Blizz makes more money off the multi-boxers than the account sharers. That's why multi-boxing is allowed but account sharing isn't.
---
I thought that guide gave you a choice between Loch Modan and Darkshore. Most will go to Loch Modon to save themselves the boat ride.
---
why is that bad?
---
Even 40" is kinda ridiculous on a desk, but whatever floats your boat. Just buy it off a place you can return it. I know a lot of people that have the money to spend and just order a 40 or 50 inch screen and then when they get it they're like wtf and just send it back straight away for a smaller one.
---
Its not wall running, theres a jumpable way out.
---
Dude I'm literally saying he leveled slow as fuck and he plans on leveling slow as fuck again and enjoying it.
---
&gt;When I raided back then, you didn‚Äôt go out of your way to raid MC and BWL when you were already at a Naxxramas level. You‚Äôre never forced to do anything, but have something for your guild to explore/experience at the level they‚Äôre at. This isn‚Äôt like Weekly/Daily quests.
---
Then the don't exist for primary progression. Nobody will end up doing them other than for fun.
---
hahahahah. Hi asmongold's mom.
---
let me repeat myself in case you didn't hear it the first time:
---
fuck streamers.
---
It is alliance territory. I just checked.
---
Tier 3 btw &lt;3
---
Not when they combine
---
I like nostalgic, long winded posts about peoples experiences with the game.
---
I use a 47" monitor. I do CAD work so it's warranted. And I will never game on something smaller haha
---
Well of course it doesn't work in combat. You use it to surprise opponents in PvP or to safely eat/drink.
---
they took that out? Why?!
---
That desperation /who...
---
Id like to see them release with the post-nerf damage and health values for the NPCs, then as they release more content buff the NPCs to their pre-nerf values.   
---
Essentially making up for the increase in gear people will have with naxx gear and so on.   
---
I do prefer the 1.12 BG, but I really like the pre-nerf values for the NPCs. (So it would be great to have that in my opinion)
---
I thought they said that there was dynamic respawns :o didn't they say that in the interview with tipsout? Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I know onhit enchants work with wf, i had a shaman with a fast dagger that had lifesteal on it and you would get multiple procs off 1 swing
---
Quick! Someone make a meme out of this post!
---
If the group wanted it I said my lock picking wasn't high enough. 
---
Then I went back. 
---
Why cause drama by debating it?
---
ikr, I went though all five stages of grief
---
I'm almost 100% certain this will be one of the QoL changes that makes it into classic, no reason to cap ignore lists.
---
This is going to be long, sorry!
---
In original Vanilla I was a Hunter and a Rogue. I played Rogue til Wotlk, then went enh shammy the rest of the way for the most part. 
---
Rogue is way too popular and I kinda want a change of pace.
---
Hunter - to show how much I actually loved hunters, I had a 19, 29, 39, 49 twinks and a 60 main. I tried a hunter on a Pserver a little while ago and wow, I just can't play it anymore. The auto shots feel clunky, the aimed shots feels so weird, and everything about it just killed the vibe for me.
---
Enh shaman - its basically a worse warrior, and impossible to pve with.
---
Feral - highly considered this but again, no one likes ferals it seems, and they have difficulty tanking supposedly. Idk.
---
Ive always played either melee or Hunter so then I decided maybe I'd completely switch it up and go caster, which I've never mained a caster in any MMO. 
---
I tried mage, fun but idk, not my thing.
---
Tried Lock, and I've always liked the look of Locks, especially the old school gameplay of dots. I played a lock for a few months on pservers and decided this was the class I was most likely gonna play. I really didn't feel like I loved the class, but it was ok, viable, and going to be in demand imo. In PvP it was getting a little tedious with the ramp up time on dots, and then PvE got seriously stale just spamming shadow bolts.
---
For the hell of it I tried Shadow priest, which I only leveled a priest to 35 in Vanilla and never played one any other expac. Man I loved it. The PvP was so fun, being able to burst with 1 powerful dot, and fluid casting, where as the lock seemed way too slow. It's also really fun to pop out of shadow to heal people in BGs. The only thing is they go oom quick, but every class has downsides.
---
As for playing Shadow I'm still on the fence. In Vanilla I almost never saw Spriests, and from research people really only want 1. Might be hard to get in groups, but not sure. I wouldn't mind healing to get Shadow gear, but then I'd be waiting til our group over gears the content and I get the second pickings of caster dps gear.
---
Tldr: Vanilla and BC were my favorite expacs of all time, but I definitely had an awakening with how limited and niche every class is. Can't just play how you want to play, which is a good thing and a bad thing though.
---
Lock main to no life and enh shammy/ resto to heal the boys when they‚Äôre playing
---
If you make a priest everyone will want to be your friend. You will always have a spot in raids. Priest is challenging and fun to play.
---
They put an internal cooldown of a couple seconds on windfury Midway through vanilla so windfury could no longer proc windfury which could proc windfury... But I believe any melee attack outside of that CD window can proc it.
---
Not at all true. It depends on the server.
---
Feelsterribleman
---
I would say the hunter is the best and easiest class to play... and the hardest to master.
---
The mage only comes into their own at level 30 and that is a long time to wait.
---
Sure, but speed levelers will be level 60 by then so who cares.
---
starting to feel old. :/
---
Have fun cherry picking kb‚Äôs and being otherwise useless in bgs... ._.
---
Well good luck on finding something! You've still got a good 70-something days :)
---
People think that you can make 100g/hour in classic.
---
4 Mages.  Then a 5th wand-spec mage.
---
Joke's on you, Darnassus is still my favorite city.
---
That's a great idea! I was considering Warrior
---
There's a weekly stickied thread called *Looking for Group Monday*. You can find them all in the sidebar or by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
---
Because it's the popular thing online. Many people want to play the top popular thing, regardless of what it is. There's something nice about playing a game that everyone is talking about.
---
For Healer I was thinking Priest. Idk how much id like tanking
---
Mage was my first main that I levelled to 60 back in my vanilla days. I'd say it's easier to play, but playing a Priest isn't really hard either. I plan on re-rolling a Priest come August, but that's because I thoroughly enjoyed playing that class.
---
Achievements was the weight on myself.  The decreased community segments, LFG, flying, treadmill of tier sets.  No of that bothered me as much.
---
I had a ton of achievements when Wrath came out.  Chased them all in my spare time.  Had about 90% of the achievements.  Then Cata hits and makes you feel like you just got reset.  Or you take an expansion off, come back and feel empty.
---
Regardless of what you think about achievements, they definitely wore me out and turned me away from the game.
---
That was a travesty
---
If time is a factor go warrior. A friend and I are in our 30s now so it's not like when we were 15 and could play 50 hours a week. We have lives and need to make sure we pick classes that won't have to wait hours for groups
---
Hmm. When I played vanilla I was always jealous of paladins that seemed to effortlessly keep aggro of 5+ mobs in instances from levels 30-50. Our raid even had a few paladin off tanks that did a good job of holding trash packs together.
---
What was going on there? Was it just retribution aura ?
---
Also, I should still be flash of light spamming when I first get it? I know it only heals like 70 health when people will have around 600.
---
Did you go there as a horde? Does it auto flag you?
---
I'm gonna play a priest. They have awesome kits! Their solo leveling is pretty good too
---
480p.  Thought 10p per inch.
---
People giving advice in this thread and they dont even know what a super ultrawide monitor even is. Classic wow will 100% support any 32:9 super ultrawide as its using the same engine as modern retail.
---
You can play it yourself on one of the numerous private servers.  I'm in the beta and the leveling experience is basically identical between classic beta and a private server.
---
The only real difference is private servers have dynamic respawns and the beta doesn't.
---
Except druids 8(
---
Wow thank you for all your input! This is the kind of reply I was hoping for. Priest has been in the back of my mind but I think I would want to heal for PvE as well as PvP. But I've heard that they get farmed easy in BGs, so im still not sure. There are so many decisions to make!
---
Never said that at all?
---
I just love the ‚Äúall raids will be done in 1 hour first week of launch and they are all easy‚Äù mentality...
---
Literally no one says this, unless they're talking about a warrior.
---
You realize hundreds of thousands of people still play the game right? Nostalgia goggles aren't an argument.
---
Hey I started on Greymane too! Human warrior. Never made it to 60 though...
---
I since transferred the character.
---
Why put a mage in tbc gear on the cover?
---
How are they as healers in end-game PvP?
---
Lvl 60 rush and MC cleaned within 7 days: "Classic has no content, we need more content or classic will die"
---
&gt;  Something that can only be done by Stream Sniping.
---
Oh come on false stream sniping accusations are gonna be thrown around all over the place. Most people don't watch twitch streams, the vast majority of deaths are just gonna be getting outplayed by random people.
---
This is a very mixed opinion thing
---
This sub? Man I honestly doubt it.
---
If you‚Äôre not here to bitch and overreact about streamers and how they‚Äôre gonna ruin ‚Äúmuh classic‚Äù then sadly you‚Äôre in the wrong place!
---
I think a lot of people who say they will play warrior, wont realise how painful it actually is to level, and will reroll.
---
Aw shit, was 1.12 before or after the Windfury nerf?
---
But not enforced by blizzard it would be a community thing
---
Yeah but not dynamic as most think, classic it only kicks in if the majority of mobs in an area is killed by multiple people, if it kicks in the timers go from 5 minute respawn to 2-3.
---
I wonder since Fury Warriors filling main DPS spots was a private server thing &amp; threat will matter more on classic compared to private servers that fury warriors will fall down a bit since they have no way to reduce threat
---
That kindof makes sense actually. Still don't see the point of it but I suppose cheering in sports is kindof pointless too.
---
I didn't make the video. Found it on our old website.
---
There‚Äôs very few pieces that anyone would wear from the pvp sets if they have access to aq40/naxx gear.  
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure rogue and hunter wouldn‚Äôt wear a single piece.
---
If people drop their accounts because of streamers it will most certainly cost blizzard money.
---
They were using concecrate. Its great for AoE tanking, but theres no point in AoE tanking if your group doesnt have any AoE.
---
70 health is plenty, the last thing you want to do is wait til half your group is down to 50% and watch half of them die because you cant heal fast enough.
---
Seems all the streamers with cult followings are north American
---
I'm still can't decide between undead and troll :P
---
Fortunately for classic, the overwhelming majority of its players will not have played retail in a very long time and won‚Äôt have any significant amount of gold over there. 
---
On bfa there are quite a few multiboxers around but that‚Äôs almost entirely for gold farming. herbs/mining nodes can be gathered by up to 10 characters and mobs in the open world can be looted by up to 8, which makes it stupidly lucrative to multibox if you spend enough time farming. 
---
Even without the box price for classic I suspect multiboxing will be super niche since you can‚Äôt pay your sub with classic gold, and you don‚Äôt just get a flat multiplier to your gold farming.
---
shammies, shaman gear is weird but you make the most out of raid sets, the pvp set is plain weird... Paladins you only go for it if you want to reckbomb some dudes later (it is fun), if you don't want to reckbomb then you don't need it as well  
---
So healer paladins or shamans don't really have a use to those sets..
---
lol, rekt
---
Play a LOT
---
We designed a speed running route for Alliance over the last couple of years for launch.  
---
Darkshore is the quickest area not Westfall.  
---
Splicing quest chains into one coherent design is pretty involved. Like the horde side guides, getting around efficiently will be the key to getting ahead.
---
I'm just 2 years older than Warcraft 3.
---
&gt;before the first lockout.
---
Even p server heroes cannot bypass just the sheer amount of time it takes to level, it will make it to the 2nd lockout, not much past that.
---
I just finished the written version over on my blog, if you'd like it early ;)
---
https://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/06/gear-your-heavy-healer-fast-shaman-and.html
---
I have second hand depression for you man. Ouch
---
They changed it in 1.3 as far as i know to have an internal cooldown on windfury
---
They can be considered squishy compared to pallys who are almost impossible to kill, and druid/shaman are crazy slippery. But their healing and buffing is top notch. Power word sheild plus heals will save the day. AoE fear is awesome defensively and they have great utility with mind control and mana drains.
---
There are two trinkets from Wyrmthalak from what I found.
---
Well, it'll probably work, but you might be oom a lot ;)
---
They said they might offer some form of server transfer at some point, as they did eventually in vanilla, but not the others
---
Were calling you old. There's nothing more to it you boomer.
---
I guess that was before the TF nerf? Crazy dmg!
---
All the surveys and all the Beta census data proves you wrong.
---
Thats my presumption, but I also was one of those that assumed that dungeon damage was too low on the closed beta. I was then proven wrong when i dug up old youtube videos and such to see the same damage numbers.
---
Nooooooooooo
---
Why would you trust blizzard to make an expansion to classic lol. TBC is very good, any expansion blizzard makes will be ass
---
Yup :( its either a 1second or 3second cooldown. I believe its the later.
---
The only concern I have is that warriors will be to shit tier to learn to tank.  Warriors will be one of the top 3 classes easily, and most of them will want to dps while the inevitably shortage of tanks happens.
---
The reputation values did change from Vanilla to TBC. If you are basing your plan on PC values you will need to review your plan. Sorry :(
---
I was looking for this the other day with no luck! Thank you!
---
Awesome dude, some good memories of those raids. Brodjah and Laerdo were top blokes. Honestly had a blast in that guild. Except for the Vael wipes, I still have nightmares :P
---
I honestly find 5 mans a lot easier to get groups with as Hunter, in terms of the DPS classes. You only half compete with Warriors and Rogues and not at all with casters. Warlocks and Mages absolutely hate running with eachother because their dungeon gear is identical, so the casters would also rather have a Hunter in the group. Finally, nobody wants heal classes DPSing for extra gear competition.
---
Not sure if copypasta...
---
&gt; You are missing the point entirely.
---
With respect, *you* are missing the point entirely.
---
You are assuming people will defend, which is almost certainly wrong. It is not in their interests to defend and that knowledge is widespread in the player base.
---
If both sides want to zerg for the finish line, nothing whatsoever stops either of them.
---
Decent troll, I give it a 5/7
---
Sounds like you should go find a group on Roll20.net and play some tabletop RPG that way instead of WoW.
---
#No CHange
---
Kargoz made a lot of really in-depth guides branded as Classic WoW, but all use private server info. I'd take a lot of the specifics with a grain of salt, but the dude at least does his research.
---
Oh I know damage and tuning is off on pservers. I've been around on this subreddit long enough to see the discussions about Classic vs Private tuning.
---
Knowing that private servers are off does nothing to diminish my hype. If anything, it makes me more excited because I can't wait to see how things will be on a real server and how it will change the way I approach the leveling process.
---
4th times
---
This post is so cute.
---
Remembering Quel'danas gives me headaches.
---
Nope. :&gt;
---
great thanks
---
I might add that grinding mobs/dungeons is also no longer an option from what I have heard.
---
Actually you are part of the toxic community. Most of us on this reddit for example are very passionate (yes sometimes it causes arguments) but your entire post had no substance and nothing helpful or insightful. 
---
You‚Äôre acting like a spoiled kid yourself, if you don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs happening with classic then don‚Äôt play. Simple.
---
You probably made yourself angrier and ruined your day by posting this anyway.
---
Sharding layering call it what you want. You are split up.
---
I hope your kids don't grow up to be like you
---
Mining is good. Fishing is great on any char.
---
WoW was designed to play on toasters. 
---
You can actually set the graphics to "classic" settings. 
---
Your computer is going to be more than enough to handle it honestly.
---
Ah, SoupaSoka... I have heard of his frightening tales. He wields the infamous Post Locker, browsing by new and sniping every imaged thread down. Looks like this victim was spared.
---
Sure some might but the vast majority don't.  People going for PvP rank don't want them and people going for AV Reputation don't either.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to putting in the original AV but it won't change anything.  Everyone now has tons of knowledge of Classic WoW so they know what the most efficient way of getting things is.  And that is going to be rushing and either losing or winning quickly.
---
Trolls have the highest base agi in the horde.  
---
If you have a pocket healer, then troll is BiS, the racial is just that good.  
---
One thing to keep in mind, is that when you get to naxx tier gear/weapon, in the horde the troll becomes the strongest race
---
\&gt;might
---
Its unclear what he meant. Get off your high horse
---
Yeah it's crazy to see him in that role as I know him best as a hilarious comedic actor on the show "Friday Night Dinner."
---
Is that a 4k non crit?
---
Fury warrior with mining engineering(engineering is must for any real gamer), and find a healer preferably paladin/shaman with enchanting(and optinally herbalism), then farm DME 2man. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto
---
What are you playing while you wait for classic to come out?
---
Then play BfA. There you will be able to do exactly that.
---
There will be no "Balance Patches" in Classic, no matter how often you ask.
---
OP's inspiration comes from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byoery/this_community_is_really_toxic_specifically_the/?st=jwpjyqab&amp;sh=5a5e834f) and he made some strange modifications.  
---
Not sure what the goal was here.
---
Reported for personal insult.
---
Yes, I am going to play BfA. I'm also not asking for balance patches. I was just responding to your question 'is this a better game for being balanced?'
---
This belongs in a museum. It's one of the first forms of video shitposting that's very popular today.
---
There is unfortunately very little to be gained from slowing down the leveling process. Other than your sanity and perhaps the smell of roses.
---
Rofl
---
Hahahaha :D that was a nasty fight although im not sure if i had moved onto Triarii by then. Thunderhorn was a great server!
---
You are clearly delusional
---
There are only 3 reasons not to go troll and those are if you want to be a druid a warlock or alliance scum.
---
And on horde we got green human, dead human, cow human and ugly human! :)
---
Honestly dude... that's sad! But still, it's about recreating an old game with as less changes as possible.
---
Avoid wow classic or happy riding! Blizz is not responsible for making the game working for you. And as far as I can see it's made for the no changes people that actually fought for it. I guess you didn't back then...
---
Unless you give your account to your kid in your will and then they play.
---
The female troll is thicc.
---
MC/Onyxia will be in the game at launch just like they were at the original release.
---
Ah okay thanks
---
Is this where we form the circle?
---
&gt; Something that has me worried about classic is that now that almost everyone has played through live wow, won't classic be viewed as much simpler and lead to more min / max style characters and crazy trick pulls etc that took literally years to learn right from the get go in classic?
---
The major difference will be pre-knowledge ***and*** current resources available. 
---
Back in the day, there were not many resources for you to go online and learn about the game and all it's little quirks. 
---
Now you have access to massive data bases, large forums (like this one), and a lot of content created about the game that is easy to find. 
---
The only difference I would say will be that some people will know ahead of time before you "get to that information". 
---
What will serve you better is knowing ***exactly*** what to expect when you reach max level for the class that you want to play.
---
&gt;Scary shit! I was under the impression though that greens in TBC were massively better
---
The greens in TBC were better mainly in terms of stamina and rarely in terms of damage to begin with. It took me until around level 66/67 to replace the warlord gear because of the set bonus accompanied with it that provided flat AP.
---
This said the clips you see aren't a true representation of warrior damage. Pat is buffed up the fucking ying which is rare in battlegrounds but he also has an extra talent point because of a bug, and if that wasn't enough he also consistently has the berserker buff.
---
Your mom.
---
This is a Copy of a deleted post a couple of hours ago...
---
My answer stays the same...
---
Please play any othe mmorpg of this time... DarkAgeOfCamelot for example.
---
As an Alternative - set up your own P-Server and use GM-Commands to get what you want... 
---
That would be truly a win-win. You get what you want and we... can have what we want...
---
Why wouldn't I trust them? Every time they expanded vanilla WoW, it was great (BWL, ZG, AQ, Naxxramas).
---
TBC is not "very good." It's the first thing that steered WoW towards the garbage bin.
---
if you want to kill shit in wpvp go holy reckoning dude, if not go holy shock build, in most cases holy paladin will be healing/dispelling the warrior so he can give the other people some FREEDOM, it is fun to kill people yourself but seeing someone go in a killing spree as you keep them alive is fun as well lol
---
The only class that race matters on is Priest.
---
For real look at his post history. This guy should be banned
---
Regardless of class your best bets for money are probably Skinning/Enchanting with a Fishing secondary profession.
---
Not if you're managing them correctly.
---
Wow +1 that was incredibly fast. This will be very usefull, thanks a lot's!
---
nope. on a paerver i played, people waited at fps to wpvp till their bg pop came up. rolled the bg permade and came back to camp burningsteps and so on. it would be literal aids
---
if you watch his debuffs you can see he isn't using death wish every clip though. so it's still mostly legit
---
Yes you‚Äôre split in both cases but they are way different in how they function
---
Day 2 I woke up early and ran to Thunder Bluff to meet my shaman and druid friends. I didn't know that sticking to pathways meant you didn't get attacked so I went, as the crow flies, through Durotar and The Barrens.
---
Whenever I saw a mob I would send my imp to get agro, then run past the enemy.
---
It took fucking ages.
---
It is hard to say how the economy will look in Classic when you first start out. 
---
In general, it might be worth it to get gathering professions for when you are leveling so you have a source of income. 
---
However, ***everyone*** might be doing that too. Which would mean that supply might be high and demand low, which would mean less money for you. 
---
So going for gather / profession that compliments that, might not be a bad idea.
---
And here I am with my roughly 9 incher...
---
It's pretty common to wear 3-4 pieces while gearing up. Even if it's kinda subpar compared to pre-raid BiS, it's a lot better than the random greens you're probably wearing when you hit 60.
---
Some of the BiS items are 1% drops, or don't come out until Dire Maul, or they are BiS for 4 different classes so competition is high. Loot is more rare in vanilla compared to retail, so a lot of people will be wearing partial T0 for months.
---
I've done this.  
---
Emptied the mail, deleted the letter, and tried to find a group for something all in the space of about 5 seconds in a desperate attempt to not let the event enter my long term memory.
---
Godwin's law, nice one
---
They already are.
---
Hey there it‚Äôs me Tanner from High School
---
Outstanding acting tho by the actor
---
Tusks and Tufts, man!
---
Perfect! Thank you for your help :)
---
From what I understand, holy paladins were hard to kill, but you're probably not going to be killing things. 
---
Although "shockadin" were apparently pretty good.
---
Because it was.
---
Any plans for Giantstalker or cryptstalker ? :)))
---
"Vast majority".
---
In reality a small subset of NA players.
---
Based foxtrot
---
well look at his buffs, see that he is in full R14 gear, and (nothing against them personally) it looks like he is just steamrolling an AB pug
---
Sure, mostly legit for sure. Not entirely though which is in my opinion quite souring.
---
He already has 15+ buffs and the zerker in most of the encounters he didn't need to add bugged damage ontop of it.
---
Guide doesn‚Äôt recommend thunderfury? NEXT
---
I'm leveling a ret paladin because I love the class/spec and my first alt will likely be a clothie healer in case I get asked to heal too
---
Exactly what I‚Äôll be doing haha
---

---
Any time, hope to see you out on Azeroth soon.i plan to level a shaman alt nice and slow with a warrior friend. I'm gonna sit back and just heal/buff and enjoy it
---
I'm not sure how can we still misunderstand each other. Even the best friends want to get something for each of them. Multiboxer gets stuff for himself. Large amounts of.
---
There's no point to compare one multiboxing 5 chars to a group of 5 people. What I'm trying to say is that one multiboxing 5 chars gets many times that one playing normally.
---
I think it was a 3 second cooldown, becuase I remember discussions in later expansions about how the "20% chance" tooltip was inaccurate because enhance could no longer use 2h weapons, and there was no end-game 1h weapons with an attack speed greater than three seconds.  So the tooltip percentage was always wrong, since your 1st attack after Windfury had a 0% chance at proccing Windfury due to the cooldown.
---
Back when we rode in single file.
---
Hope not
---
To be fair you could run around in your Tier gear to look awesome and just slip on the BiS gear when you raid/pvp.
---
You might not of heard of this guy Asmongold but he is pretty chill and down to earch, check him out

# PLANS TO RUIN THE SPIRIT OF CLASSIC  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRzJDDxyZqk)
---
That's a good plan. I'm going Horde so Pally isnt an option for me. If I was to go Alliance I would go Dwarf pally though!
---
Both sides won't all want to zerg.  People defend in AV to this day, it's just not viable.  It *used* to be viable in early AV.
---
Shaman is another one I considered! Too many options!!!
---
Shit man that's a no brainier, go priest. If I could stomach healing all the time I'd go priest. They are surprisingly durable for a clothy because of bubble. You'll get easy pve groups, and if you ever decide to go shadow in PvP it's a lot of fun.
---
Spirit too. Less time eating = more time killing.
---
Shamans sound like a lot of fun
---
Hi, /u/Caesiumguy
---
Man, this is some top-notch propaganda!
---
&gt; Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for
---
2 of the 3 Alliance cities have been built in the past ~10 years or so.
---
&gt;When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? 
---
Garithos was a piece of shit.  He had nothing to do with Stormwind.  Gul'dan was directly responsible for the demonic enslavement of the Orcs and betrayed the Horde in the Second War.  Should we blame all Orgrimmar Orcs for the actions of Gul'dan? Hell no!  Also, idk where you are getting the idea that Garithos let the Sunwell fall?  Arthas defiled it in the Third War, and Kael'thas destroyed it to save his people from it's corruption.
---
&gt;Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps?
---
The Internment Camp Act was passed by Lordaeron.  The people of Stormwind had no say over what to do with the Orcs.  They were busy rebuilding their city and kingdom.  You know, the one razed by the orcs?
---
&gt;And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol?
---
What?! Dwarves fought all throughout the Third War.  Lordaeron, Northrend, Kalimdor. Literally all of it. The Gnomes were repelling a massive invasion in Gnomeregan and STILL sent supplies and weapons north to combat the Scourge, nearly dooming their civilization in the process.  
---
&gt;Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara and Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all?
---
Yeah, I guess when Malfurion destroyed Nordrassil and gave up his race's immortality without hesitation to save the goddamn world that was just straight incompetence.  If you have a better solution to stopping Arhcimonde, I'm all ears. 
---
Azshara and the Highbourne were corrupted by Sargeras which led to the first invasion of The Burning Legion and the War of the Ancients.  You're really going to persecute all Night Elves for this and conveniently absolve the Orcs for their own fall to demonic corruption and subsequent invasions of Azeroth?
---
OP proves just how toxic it really is
---
Yes. Classic fury warriors with Tfury will not be going this kind of damage output.
---
I like how he said "you can run to the dungeon if you want" but fails to realize that he can do the same thing, if he doesn't like the game he can just not play it. I feel sorry for his wife and kids if this is how he acts.
---
Man, Dark Age of Camelot is a terrible suggestion for a casual friendly game. The whole thing is designed for max level PvP in mind.
---
if u dont respond to their threads they dont care
---
When Classic comes out there will be a lot of players who have never played classic, or even WoW, before.
---
A lot of people will be rerolling! If you don't change classes, you'll be fine.
---
I just didn't do them and just did what I enjoyed?
---
I don‚Äôt get why people feel the need to ask why people want beta keys.  It should be pretty obvious that the current beta server is a cool semi-twink meta that looks super fun even if it only lasts another couple months.
---
Also for those of us who‚Äôve planned our levelling routes out - we can only rely on private servers and those have been shown to have so much shit wrong.  It‚Äôs so obvious that we‚Äôd want to test that kind of thing.
---
Then it comes to addons - there‚Äôs a number of addons that have not yet been updated to classic and I for one have a list that I really want to use from launch day1.  If I had beta I‚Äôd look at updating or recreating any addons that I really need that aren‚Äôt being updated.
---
Technically correct, I guess. There's mines, but they're not the kind that explode, they're the kind that you walk into. Originally there were both.
---
Mage
---
Priest might just be the move! Thank you so much! Now we wait for August..
---
Classic will be a brand new fresh start. Never a better time to start
---
I just want to know what the BITCH macro does.
---
Skinning and control the devilsaur mafia
---
Yeah but would have been a negative shadow resistance mob, would assume cant see logs for it.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the hugely important ‚ÄúVanilla WoW saved me from xxxx‚Äù
---
roflmao, what he gets for not using CC
---
The reason players complained about Old AV was because you earned less honor and often didn't stay alive to win.
---
Players did BGs for the fastest honor gains.
---
Very good point! Thank you for your input
---
You can
---
If you mean something similar to shift-hover to compare, the classic beta had that when I played the last stress test.
---
Nice to get Details, if you have Recount ark uninstall it and get Details instead
---
Going to main a tauren warrior. Alt will be that undead rogue.
---
Hes gone on record saying this...which is just wild to me. You'd think he would have at least given a LITTLE attention to them
---
There is no such thing as spell missing, spells can only be resisted.
---
Casual in 2004 != Casual now.
---
You can just play BFA and get all the QoL features. Why try to ruin the game for people who want the alternative?
---
&gt;Shaman can wear tier with set bonuses.
---
Kind of - Legs are best served with Salamander Scale Pants for quite a long time, and 3 piece Ten Storms is best in slot even into Naxx for the chain heal buffs (since they're based on a percentage not a set value, it's incredibly strong). 
---
As a shaman in vanilla, the only time I rocked full 8pc Earthfury or Ten Storms was basically as a meme. Pretty sure I did 8pc Ten Storms before a boss in MC to see how much damage the lightning shields would do - Turns out its not much.
---
How are we supposed to know?
---
You want to full clear naxx but you don't have much knowledge.  
---
Ok, mechanics are not as hard as some raids in retail, that is true, but you won't be getting through c'thun without time investment.  
---
Most guilds will break in AQ, I would say that at most 15% of the guilds will get to naxx. Its not hard, but it is not easy, and the time investment is ridiculous...  
---
If you do want to get on naxx however you will need to fork 6 - 8 hours a day AT LEAST. You need to farm shit, and there is a fucking lot of farming to do. That's why we all say that only hardcore guilds will get to naxx, casual players will never get there. There is so much gear checks in naxx its amazing.  
---
Classic wow doesn't have titanforging or all that shit, you either get the gear from farming the fuck out of something or you don't, that's why there is a lot of people that doesn't even get to raid, because they don't have time to farm pre-raid, consums or other things, and that is fine, if you put in the time, you get stronger, and that's what we love about classic!
---
2nd totem is all the same quest for all 3 shaman races.
---
Why was this deleted??
---
You like melee and a grind! I respect it!
---
For naxx40 progression?  I call bull on that one.  Most guilds back then were running 4-5 days a week for 4-5 hours each day to clear naxx.
---
Since noone answered fully yet, let me share my memories after having farmed r14 on a relatively well known and fully populated pvp server. 
---
\- The time estimates shared here by others is fairly accurate
---
\- Your progression in ranks depends on how the other people on your server are doing compared to you. If you are lucky, the top honorfarmers have a weekly honor of like 400k for example. If you're unlucky, 800k, Difficult to say beforehand how much time you'll spend, but it's probably 12h / day farming once you're high ranked. One thing people haven't mentioned yet is:
---
\- You do NOT need to spend those inordinate amounts of time the entire time. I started out just liking BG's and queueing alot. Then I noticed the gear I could get from rank 11 or 12, I don't remember exactly, but anyway I started getting abit more serious about it and joined a premade after school. I believe I was rank 7 or 8 when I joined the premade, It was only at rank 10-11 where I went full crazy mode cancelling all raids all social conventions and just farming honor all day long neckbeard mode.
---
\- Once you're in a premade, you will most likely be assigned a number of honor that you are allowed to get. You're not supposed to go over this amount, or you'll be kicked from the premade. The way it works is:
---
\- The people who are at rank 13 and want to continue to r14, need to place #1 or close (on their server) in order to see any progress in their honor rank progress bar. The people at r12 need abit less to still progress, and so on and so on. So there will be some people trying to orchastrate this on your server. Not everyone is guaranteed to agree (those who don't will have to solo, but there are some people who share accounts and even though solo farming is slower than premades farm honor, them playing night and day is a huge threat) and if you're very unlucky, there are more than one premades for your faction on your server. I say unlucky because when there is no concensus on how much honor everyone can make, then it's kind of FFA and that means the levels of no-living will go to high extremes.  
---
Even when this all can be organized, you'll still all need to be higher than the normal pvpers that aren't in your premade though, and you need to please everyone in your premade as well (say someone is told to stop at 250k at #10 place, while he can easily farm 400-450k and be at #1 or #2.. that person is not going to be happy and will argue that he should get the #5 or #6 spot or something close. The standard solution to these kind of issues is: everyone just farm more). 
---
So, the amount of hours farming will definitely always be high, but depends on a few individuals in your server. 
---
Someone correct me if this information is incorrect due to this 'change' some people mentioned. My assumptions are that only 1 person can be come r14 per faction per server, and that this zero-sum system where I ranked in, will be the one going live in wow classic.  
---
Hope this helped
---
The boots give a 15% speed bonus to ghost wolf, very useful.
---
Play on a private server then.
---
Pretty sure it is.
---
These need to stop
---
i mean using 3set t2 all the way into naxx sounds a lot like using tier to me ;)
---
This is as far as you need to look. It's the only warrior specific gold farming profession advice you can get. Otherwise it's the same across classes.
---
What mandatory daily quest did you have to do in wrath? Pre raid the tabards got you the rep for pre raid gear. The only daily I remember was hodir but if it bothered you just take inscription. Daily dungeon was not the end of the world to miss one. Maybe you dislike dailies because of the mindset it puts you in?
---
I'm in my 30's now too. My issue is that once I have done a ton of 5 man stuff I might want to raid. Guilds have a LOT of warriors, hunters seem in demand.
---
mount takes same time and you will be using epic by then....
---
Haha you're welcome glad to help. And I know, such a shitty wait.
---
We will have 60s on the first week, I'm 100% sure multiple groups of people will take turns playing the same character with 100% uptime.
---
The no-sleep 300 page leveling guide guys will be there on the 2nd week.
---
Paladins were still invited to raids, so he didn‚Äôt see the big issue. Not every was intended nor required to be valid on bleeding edge content.
---
lol pay to win im just getting more for more effort feel free to do same, its basically the only challenging way to play wow, to control 5 characters sametime. It shouldnt be taken away. And for that effor i deserve extra income too, i mean i have to gear all those characters too. Control 1 char if you're a casual but dont take the challenged gameplay from us away!
---
The bottom line is that the raid mob values are wrong on private servers.  We don't know in which direction, but we do know that deep breath and flame buffet is not working correctly, as well as rag's lavaburst/fireball not being cast enough.  
---
Yea, content will be cleared a lot faster than it was back then.  I don't think anyone doubts that.  But going into MC with greens and no fire resist to down rag?  I would pay money to see that one happen in week 1.  
---
Also doubt the average semi-serious or serious guild is going to be able to clear all content within 7~ hours of raid time.  I can't even begin to fathom how there would be that big of a difference in AQ40/naxx40 with players compared to now... people were a lot better by the time those raids hit and the guilds who were progressing through content the fastest had good players overall.  
---
We will see I guess.
---
Also, I'll be Alliance. In a 5 man you'd want 1 plate, 1 mail, 1 leather, 1 cloth plus one extra. As a hunter I don't have to worry about someone not wanting me to take their gear. Plus, bows/guns aren't in crazy demand either.
---
I'm stoked for things taking longer, it's part of what makes the game actually interesting. The point isn't just doing the things, it's experiencing everything along the way. If you have an hour to play then you play for an hour, you don't have to play longer just because the time spent isn't 100% doing the standard thing. Source: also a dad
---
Apparently first aid doesn't even exist in retail now.
---
&gt; What classes are good for pretty much all pve content? MC - Naxx.
---
All classes are good for pve content. The real question is, which spec is good for pve content. 
---
Most hybrids will be pigeon holed into healing roles. It will be rare to see a hybrid class in a raid that isn't healing spec. Not only are their gear options in general more demanding and random (you have to put together a hodgepodge set), they are often not optimized or better when compared to other "pure" dps classes. 
---
&gt; I hear alot of "95% of all x's wont see the inside of naxx".
---
That's players. Most players did not see the inside of Naxx for a variety of reasons. 
---
1) Attunement was required to get inside and it was pretty lengthy. 
---
2) Gear progression was set up in such a way that there was no catch up mechanic in the game. There was no new dungeon, no new source of gear or anything like that to get new players or current players "caught up". 
---
This means that you had to literally do previous raid tiers in order to even set foot into Naxx. Naxx was tier 3, so that means you had to have players generally do tier 1 and tier 2 raids to get caught up first. 
---
3)  Naxx was released 6 months before TBC. So one could argue that players were not interested in working hard to get to Naxx only to not do it because of the new expansion.
---
If you make 30ish on Classic I think you'd feel the sunken time.
---
I was going to say that your comment somehow  contributes even less than the other responses, but it appears that you somehow managed to actually read the OP which is all I was really concerned about.
---
With the right gear, hpal should be able to aoe farm lashers.
---
Is this another post of you complaining? Didn‚Äôt you do this already today
---
Father of the Year Reward inc
---
&gt; JUST LET ME PLAY THE FUCKING GAME I WANT TO
---
You can, but that game isn't Classic.
---
Finally a quality Post that's Not shitting over Streamers or asking for a beta key.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure even if they did attempt to use CC, it would be resisted most of the time
---
I don't really want multi-day AV's because getting the tokens/rep was absurd.
---
I mean don't get me wrong, it was pretty epic logging off after a huge push back into our encampment, only to come back and learn we'd managed to rebound half way up the map in my absence... The sense of a real, continuous battle was actually pretty sweet. But the actual mechanics side actually repping up and such was a slog.
---
I agree the game was made for casuals. So let‚Äôs keep it how it was.
---
You will use the Blizzard Desktop App to access the game. 
---
Classic will be a separate download from the main game. It is in essence a completely different game to retail. 
---
Beta is currently set at around 8 gigs or so. I am not sure if that is the final size of the game tho.
---
Making a human paladin do the first few quests to get level 4 then head to darnassus. Plan on getting all the night elf rep I can so my first epic mount will be a saber. Since dire maul won't be out till phase 2 I'll probably end up buying a regular mount instead of waiting for the charger. Figured with that being the case I might as well go for the mount I truly want from the beginning instead of wasting time farming rep at 60.
---
You could always...ya know... go tend your 5 kids instead of shitposting on a subreddit for a game that isnt out yet. Crazy I know but as an adult you need to understand nobody is making you play or making you read the subreddit.
---
0/10
---
I played horde through vanilla so never really experienced Alliance‚Äôs zones, with the exception of maybe NE once or twice.
---
Gonna roll a dwarf priest and play a completely new game. Can‚Äôt wait!!
---
You‚Äôre pathetic
---
You don't run to Stratholme to play the game, the run to Stratholme and the interactions you have on your way there are part of the game. By the sounds of it, classic isn't for you. Luckily there is an option for you, BFA.
---
The more serious guilds will have no issue what so ever until hitting cthun and naxx.  
---
Every other guild is still going to have a lot of people needing to be carried.  I don't think being a keyboard turner really mattered in vanilla 'too' much for most raids, but clicking makes a big difference.  Though, even that isn't as bad as people think if your rotation consists of 2 abilities for an entire fight.
---
&gt; All "progress" is irrelevant for the players and the sole purpose is to test the game. 
---
All games are irrelevant except for entertaining the player, which is what a Beta can do just as well as a full game.
---
Someone get the guilneas world records crew here
---
Exactly! I‚Äôm only salty in the sense that I wish I had access, but not at any person in particular for having access when I do not (streamer or no).  And I love video games but I could not and would not want to do what streamers do.  My issue with streamers and their fans are the effects on servers.  An MMO is susceptible to pressures an FPS or other kind of game is not, and I want nothing to do with a server infested with the mega streamers and their fans.  It may pan out poorly or it may not, but I don‚Äôt feel like risking my time investment on it.
---
I'd add that even rag for a guild of players who haven't done it before could prove to be a bit challenging.  But yea, if you can clear BWL consistently, then most of AQ40 isn't too bad.. just time consuming.
---
Oh without a doubt! That entire mini series left me both satisfied and wanting more because it was so damn good.
---
That‚Äôs not the average raiding guild hours, the guilds trying to compete on a server-best level don‚Äôt represent average raider schedule.
---
This post is what's wrong with the world. As a father myself I would expect another adult to be rational and not out cry asking others to get something changed for selfish reasons... you literally have the ability to port to dungeons in the live game. Leave my classic alone #nochanges
---
This was copy and pasted from a previous shitpost. Downvoted.
---
6 starting zones with 3000 players per layer. Using the WoW classic census (22,406 responses) that would put the following number of people starting together:
---
Human: 669 (22.3%)
---
Dwarf/Gnome: 504 (16.8%)
---
Night Elf: 360 (12.0%)
---
Orc/Troll: 636 (21.2%)
---
Undead: 579 (19.3%)
---
Tauren: 255 (8.5%)
---
3 of those starting zones are going to be a mess to get out of.
---
Don't play classic then if you can't handle running across half the world to a dungeon. If you want quality of life changes play BFA.
---
And alt runs. They‚Äôre still part of primary progression for everyone at one point.
---
Don‚Äôt fall for the bait man
---
My fault, misread this thread as being using a full tier set. cheers!
---
Think of layering like filling up cups from a gallon jug of water (players). Once the first cup is full, it is set aside and a second cup is next in line to be filled. So on and so forth. 
---
This is done to make sure that the servers do not crash and that everyone that wants to play can actually get into the game and actually get stuff done.
---
Imagine trying to do your starter quest with 500 people in the same zone. It would be impossible. It won't be fun and people will quit. It's super important that launch goes smooth in order to retain as many players as possible. 
---
Blizzard expects a lot of people to be initially interested in the game, which is why they are using layering. They anticipate a drop off of player participation, which would mean that those cups that were full are now getting low. Their next phase will be to merge cups together so they are full again. Eventually getting to the point where it's one cup.
---
Layering will not prevent you from playing with other players, however. You will still be able to group and hang out with each other in parties.
---
how much extra threat does searing pain generate?
---
I‚Äôm super glad you‚Äôll have no time to play and can remain irrelevant for the entire duration of classic wow.
---
Can we ban these trolls?
---
Not in naxx patch or anything they put in after. Just carry people in AQ or whatever raid is the second newest. 
---
Nobody will go back to MC for their alts in things after naxx patch.
---
It is a separate download because it is a different game entirely from retail. 
---
Much like how you can play Starcraft I off of the launcher and it doesn't require you to have Starcraft II downloaded.
---
This does not happen. Look at Darkfall. Open world PvP
---
You can't mount up while you are carrying the flag. This is a pvp item by the way.
---
I'll be playing with a friend who is going to level a warrior. I think I'm settled on leveling a priest with him and I'll level a shaman when we can't play together. I primarily mained a lock since vanilla but am honestly just burnt out on it. He was great to play and fun in pvp but I think I want to take on a new challenge this time around.
---
Ya, that‚Äôs not what happened in Vanilla WoW.
---
Way too big.  Everything is going to be spread out all over the screen to the point where your head/eyes will constantly be sweeping left/middle/right to capture everything that's going on, as opposed to a smaller screen where everything is more condensed within your forward field of vision.  Make sense?
---
&gt;\&gt;might
---
You quoted one word. Also, even if he doesn't intend on taking 24 days to get to 60, it's pretty clear that he doesn't intend on rushing it in as few hours /played so idk why you min/maxers are raging at us.
---
depends what addons are made for classic really so we dunno but most addons you can turn the location thing off
---
Because 2006 wow ran on my toaster, and classic is on completely different hardware.
---
I feel like we just need to apply a bit of math here.  Assuming most servers are maxed on day 1 (who knows), then all 3 layers are, in theory, going to have the max cap of 3.5k players anyway.  Only real difference is that there will be no dynamic respawns.
---
It will be bad either way.  It was horrible when vanilla first launched and you really couldn't even function.  I suspect it wont be any different this time.. just less server lag that might hold people back a bit.
---
Now if you happen to get in the 3rd layer, and said layer isn't maxed, then you will have an advantage. 
---
Pulling ahead of the pack typically means you are staying on the longest.  People who play for 15 hours straight are easily going to get ahead of the majority of people.
---
This makes me happy.
---
Sorry. Would not recoment Daoc as casual friendly. WoW was the casual friendly alternative. Thought i was saied often enough that classic wow was the casual friendly newcomer of its time...
---
Oh you had naxx on farm for several months in vanilla? The meta has changed. Unless your guild is insane slow you won't be revisiting MC when you're farming naxx or stuff they put in after it
---
Pathfinder: Kingmaker
---
Heck of a challenge, and a pretty complex and deep skill/talent system but the combat feels kinda weird. 
---
But the gameplay overall is satisfying, and so far it's kept my fantasy craving fulfilled.
---
Love it. I‚Äôll be sure to download.
---
Streaming isn't even as fun as a lot of people think. You have to constantly present this curated version of yourself and strike a balance between being honest and entertaining both on camera and social media. You have to be on and in character most of the time as you eventually develop a streaming persona. It's definitely got its perks, but it's a stressful and sometimes relentless job too.
---
Depends, how many noobs can you kill in a week?
---
&gt; I really like the play style of optimizing a groups dps by doing damage as a healer when there is nothing to heal. Is this possible on classic wow with to healer mana issues and damaging abilities costing mana?
---
This is what I like to call "Special Healing". You're helping the target die faster so you don't have to heal as much. 
---
It is case by case and you will have to gauge how much damage you can deal based on what's happening to the group. The ability to downrank your healing spells, and thus getting maximum health per mana spent, will make this work.
---
&gt; I play a druid on retail so do a lot of cat/boomkin weaving depending on the fight, is this possible in raids on classic? how to cat form ability scale (or not scale) with healing gear?
---
Not really. Hybrid classes are gear dependent and don't do roles outside of their spec / gear very well. In this case, if you're specced for Boomkin, you're going to be in Boomkin. You'll very rarely, if at all, go cat form. I mean, you just spent 31pts buffing boomkin. There'd be no reason to go cat unless you ran out of mana.
---
Unless you could only loot bodies that were lvl 60 as well
---
Druids decurse as well so they got that going for them which is nice
---
Classic should be really easy to pick up for anyone.
---
It's very casual/new player friendly.
---
Making hella sick money as early and as fast as possible.
---
I‚Äôm going to use Joana‚Äôs guide, with a few changes to add a little more time grinding and decrease time running around. I‚Äôve got a limited amount of time to play every day, so I want to be able to make some progress towards 60 without wasting too much time.
---
Never thought about the "get into 3rd layer" idea. Maybe it's smart to wait an hour or so after servers go live so the first couple layers fill up. Very interesting.
---
Hell, I played closed beta for vanilla wow..I dont even want the beta
---
Unless you've memorised where quest starts from every wanted poster, basement, and attic in the game, then yeah you'll want use one. Finally getting a group together and getting to the last boss only to realise you don't have the quest and it can't be shared is not fun.
---
Nah. I've leveled so many times I know where everything is at. My brain will be on autopilot for just about the entire leveling experience.
---
Which someone said is the solution that the private server implemented, yes.
---
What the fuck is lolcats
---
I dont think you would ever get past 10.
---
Depends on the length of phase 2 but you will be able to rank to 14 if long enough
---
Ahhh that makes sense, didn‚Äôt realize it was a graphics thing.
---
Hey, that's the guild I was in too! I was Thunderdruid, the noob druid. I had the best time though :D
---
Now this is a nice breakdown. Thank you!
---
just play a private server in the mean time you absolute idiots LOL
---
No one needs engineering.  It isn't like the difference for most of your gameplay as fury is going to be that significantly different for not having it.  
---
Yea, if you want to min max to the extreme, then you pick it... no one in the raid could ever pick it and you can still clear naxx40, farm a lot of gold with jump runs/mining, and still have fun.
---
LOL the outfit and the music that was hilarious.
---
That could be the case, but I'm probably a better dad than anyone in this sub
---
From what I understand druid tank is somewhat possible, but you have to collect a hodgepodge of gear and you'll sometimes have to grind unorthodox items in order to maximize your potential. 
---
For example, one of the best Druid Tank weapons is the Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomer, a level 30 instance. It increases your attack speed by 50% for 30s and has three charges. So you'd have to farm up 3-5 of them before raid night in order to have enough.
---
Will there be rank 14s during phase 2?
---
Wrong thread
---
‚ÄúOhh it‚Äôs too expensive to pay a sub...‚Äù
---
Dude... it‚Äôs 50c a day to play classic wow. Are you joking?
---
Your question is very hard to understand. Respec costs are as follows:  
---
1, 5, 10, 15, ..., 50, 50, 50. Decay rate is 5g / month to a minimum of 10g.
---
Go play a different game then lol
---
To be fair you see that on retail a lot as well. People get super upset because other people aren't forced to play with them.
---
Heck yeah! In my opinion it's the little things like that which make WoW a fun game.
---
I've been trying to come up with a good Chernobyl related name for my classic character. Something like 3.6Roentgens...
---
Not a chance of this. Rank 14 requires 12-16 hours a day of nonstop bg grinding, dodging, and a guild willing to support you through it. You won‚Äôt get above rank 10 with world pvp

Mages are overall much easier to play, especially in the long run.

He's tanking in zerker stance with a 2h...
---
Yup, 50g max.
---
Best music of any city!
---
Yeah just sell 5 healing pots, obviously
---
&gt; Unregistered HyperCam 2
---
&gt;quest pretty much exclusively on Kalimdor until 60.
---
Good luck with that.
---
The game treats it as another "hit", so yes. 
---
Your melee swing can hit, and your Seal of Command can get parried / dodged as well.
---
Why do people not try out private servers? I've been playing on a 1.12 server a while and having an absolute blast. It definitely fills the void for now. I'm leveling, but I'm not taking it seriously because I mean, it could be shutdown randomly, or it could last up to classic release where everyone will most likely migrate over and roll new toons like everyone else.
---
Classic is easy enough, most people in game will be friendly and happy to explain the game.  Find some nice people in game and friend them and ask if you can quest or dungeon with them.
---
...*chosen one*...
---
Maybe, possibly. You still haven‚Äôt said whether or not you played warrior.

Since you haven‚Äôt played a warrior, you have no clue what you are talking about by default. Thank you for playing. Try again.

I feel fire was superior if the target didn't need to be kited at all.  You could do some serious burst around the lvl 30ish range.
---
To each their own, but fire is a solid leveling spec as well, just not great for aoe grinding.. which I doubt most people are going to do anyway.
---
It is helpful to have it. At least on ability you know you'll be hitting often.
---
Ha
---
Look at my edited comment. It take some prep but its very doable
---
Thank you!
---
Lmao no one would ever do instances
---
When doing this kind of content, far higher than your level, it's just harder for ever hunter you don't bring. The easiest way to run it would literally be 4 hunters and a healer.
---
Yeah you're correct. Heart of the scale will likely be in at launch, heart of wyrmthalak most probably not.
---
Yea, the 3 layers are going to have a massive impact with more players pumping more gold into the economy via 3x the amount of mobs in the same amount of time. 
---
If you are one of the few players who focuses a bit on the side to make some money, then I have no doubt you can profit on the AH early.
---
I will probably get shit on for this but I actually hated TBC.
---
The locations were great... but the whole storyline and the attunement stuff including the daily quest grind? That really turned me off from TBC.
---
The only really good thing that came from TBC was the balancing.
---
Hybrid-tax was still a thing but you could actually do great damage as a Shadow-priest/Retribution Paladin/Enhancement Shaman without feeling terrible about it.
---
It‚Äôs 50c a day... Must be a Huntard.
---
Earlier, since I remember playing Counterstrike-Source &amp; HL¬≤ before I got sucked into world of warcraft.
---
What‚Äôs the etiquette if a rare piece comes in a chest from a dungeon that someone else needs? So you‚Äôre all in a dungeon, there‚Äôs a chest, everyone /rolls, and the winner gets a rare blue weapon that someone else in the group needs. Is it considered toxic if the person who won the roll doesn‚Äôt give the item and instead puts it on the AH to make a big profit?
---
Don't do it, man.  78 more days.
---
It's all worth it when you get to Dun Morogh
---
And the kinds of people who  answer WoW census surveys and actually got into the Beta skew the numbers dramatically and paint an inaccurate picture lol
---
I guess title is misleading, but ty. Understanding correctly, cost becomes a 10g min after the first 1 and 5?
---
Yep. Classic is supposed to be an authentic recreation of Vanilla. So Classic TBC should be just that.
---
And if they don't like it, they can just stick to Classic, just like they tell all the changes crowd to go play retail.
---
From what I remember if it‚Äôs BoE everyone rolls need.
---
Ok... there were gold farmers in vanilla to an extreme degree.  Didn't stop everyone from being broke still lol...
---
The solutions are to beat them to the punch, and that itself is also a form of gold buying anyway.  Remember, they have long since been able to better trace and detect gold buying.  It wont be quite as bad as it was back then.
---
Define "viable". Do you mean you got more rewards per hour that way?
---
It's a pointless conversation anyway in some sense, since we are getting 1.12 AV, so we will never know how people would respond to the old AV. But unless the rewards change people won't defend because people do what is rewarded, not what you wish they would do because then AVs would be like these mythical AVs which very, very few if any of us here actually played.
---
It's kind of like how there's brd, lbrs, and ubrs. Nobody just calls one of them BR and names the others after bosses.
---
Though, i guess more appropriately it would be BD for depths and BS for spire.
---
frost can aoe farm at 30. both got their ups and downs

"All right, Mr. Kalsembar, you win. But beware, we Germans aren't all smiles und sunshine.‚Äù
---
I'd say Herb/Alch is your best bet. Going to need those mana pots if you are dedicated to "Oomkin".
---
Yeah. Man I cant wait to play classic. Retail just takes too many things I consider fun away.
---
I‚Äôm still lost in a big old world

WoW Census doesn't require any participation...
---
Pfft, no one ever talked about that crap on the official WoW forums back then either.  That just isn't stuff the average person is going to be talking about.  
---
Your best bet is to find a small community of like minded individuals to talk to.
---
Yeah that's very true. I played a rogue to 30 about a year ago and enjoyed it. I also just finished playing a mage to 20. Might have to go back now and play a rogue again lol
---
Not for tanks.
---
what is dead may never die
---
Generation X exists, you know.
---
This is just stupid at this point, lol. You are a pretty big moron
---
Anyone else notice he is using recount, and the recount UI looks like something designed for Windows 7, and now a days people use Details which looks more likes it‚Äôs for Windows 10. Probably because Windows 7 was the OS at the time and same goes for Windows 10. Idk why I‚Äôm still typing, I‚Äôm sorry.

Blizzard is not just doing Classic out of the goodness of their heart or because "people asked for it".
---
They are putting the work into Classic to not only tap into a source of potential revenue, but (and here comes my speculation), they're going to be doing research on player behavior and "what works". 
---
The reason the game has evolved to where it is today is primarily because Blizzard has the data and numbers to look at what players are doing in their game and why they are doing it. 
---
For example, some quests in Vanilla were group quests. Some of them are not group quests and require a little help from nearby players if you want to have a smooth time with it. This is all well and good at launch and after the first couple of months since most areas will be populated. 
---
But what happens when most players are at endgame content? What happens when a new expansion drops? Those quests become near impossible to do due to low population for those old areas. Blizzard sees that people are not doing those quests, that they are skipping them. The goal from a design perspective is to make the work and effort you put into those quests last. 
---
This is precisely why they redid all the old zones in Cata. 
---
So Blizzard is going to be collecting a boat load of data and seeing what players do when given these old "issues" that the game has evolved out of.
---
Re: Warriors -- I know some players run R12 boots, gloves and legs along with T2.5 helm, chest and shoulders for end game pvp. Although, I guess as prot or stam stacking T3 may be better.
---
Mages it seems like you would always want the blink CD reduction, so you'd be wearing minimum 3 pieces.
---
&gt;All the surveys 
---
Surveys do require participation, which is what I was referring to. You should probably level up your reading comprehension. 
---
Again, the kinds of people who got into the beta are not reflective of the actual class population at launch. The numbers are fun to look at, but to project that launch numbers will identical is silly for a lot of different reasons.
---
Level 30 meta. Level 40 meta. Maybe a 50. Some classes are better at 30 than they are at 60. It provides a unique incentive to roll one class over the other. 
---
Looking at the Beta census or a survey and trying to project as what the actual server populations will be is really short sighted and dim.

This is Azeroth

^oh wait

An hour isn't enough time do run any dungeon in vanilla, honestly.  With a drastically overgeared group, yes, you can run max lvl dungeons a lot faster.. but even then it takes time to get into a group and travel to the instance.
---
An hour a day is mostly something suited for a more PvP focused person.
---
This comment is correct.
---
Literally saw VC a hundred times in West fall chat in Vanilla.
---
Buy 40 accounts. Level 4 characters to 60 on the opposite faction on all 40 of them. Aoe each set of 40 down 10 times a day on your main for 2-3 month. Grats ur rank 14 with world pvp
---
How exactly does the dungeon lockout work? Is it 5 of any dungeon per hour, or does every instance have it's unique lockout of 5 per hour? I've seen people vary between different dungeons in Scarlet Monastery to "avoid to get locked out" which confused me here.
---
Because that is a lot of extra time being spent between the two.
---
I enjoyed watching Amaz for auto chess stuff, but I fucking hate when they say twitch emotes out loud. Like it's so cringy to verbally say "monkaS" out loud
---
If someone can use it and need it, then often everyone will agree to pass on it for them and then they will equip it in front of everyone to show they are using it and not just trying to ninja it to sell on the AH
