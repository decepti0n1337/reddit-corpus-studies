I play a mage tho, so I don't need them anyway :D
---
---
---
there shouldn't be any coordinated groups in av
---
Great shit post.
---
I like to hurl obscenities at them. Gets the stress out. They won’t report me.
---
The BWL trash packs are harder than Molten Core bosses. Generally each new raid tier has more (and harder hitting) mechanics on both bosses and trash.  
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think the easiest way to look at it is MC is LFR, BWL is normal, AQ is heroic and Naxx is mythic. Obviously Naxx isn't as hard as something like mythic Eternal Palace, but the jump in difficulty between raid tiers is similar to the jump in difficulty between modern WoW difficulties.
---
Just farm muggers belt and bring it to raid to prove you intend to go daggers
---
Prepare to be downvoted to hell.  This is all facts and 100% the reason why I stopped playing this dogshit.
---
That’s pretty much a good summary of my point, yes.
---
But “y’all take this too seriously” said to someone who takes something too seriously, is unlikely to make them go “oh hey, you’re right.” They’ll probably just ignore you.
---
So if your intention is to be right, then congratulations. If your intention is to be heard, try again. My guess is your intention likely isn’t altruistic, so, oh well. Probably wasting my time. There’s a reason I didn’t just make a post and say “y’all take this game way too seriously.” It would have been downvoted and ignored. But the thread here has actually been quite positive, and helpful for some people, so...? Not really sure what your point is.
---
Yeah, but probably a pretty good change, or next toon I levelled I'd queue up at level 19 at night, then hit level 30+ before it popped.
---
Just bring muggers belt and show it to RL in trade before the PUG
---
I've legit seen 2 of these drop in half a dozen runs. I had no idea it was so rare.
---
Who would win:  
---
• A $200/mo underground russian hosted emulated server  
---
vs  
---
• An international multimedia conglomerate with multibillion quarterly revenues and the original source code  
---
I think most people agree this has been the worst *F R E S H* in 5 years and woulda died right away if it wasnt officially blizzard hosted.
---
that's not the reason for the strategy
---
Is this sold out completely?
---
Stfu with your private server rose-tinted googles.
---
How did the nostalgia change from vanilla to private servers, Pay your $15/m and stop complaining every chance you get.
---
All i want at this point is no more 30 minute queues.
---
In a few levels I’d recommend the nagas in Azshara beach. Easy to kill, so many that you never have to wait for respawns, and you can get golden pearls from the clams they drop.
---
&gt;risk of losing your character
---
If saying this makes you feel better then go for it, but you know that it is a hyperbolization. I've logged in to my Nostalrius character I've made in 2015 when WoW was announced this spring and it was still safe and sound.
---
[removed]
---
Warriors get good in the 30s. They're also good if fed gear from another char
---
No, no, no... Everyone back then was just "bad".
---
If its worth a lot of money it should be free roll for anyone. As gold as is BiS for all classes. Not fair to auto claim a boe just because you can use it. Only on items worth over 200g id say
---
Shit gets hacked.
---
Had someone try to log into my account 42 times over 2 hours. Had 2FA so I just got spammed with emails instead of hacked
---
Don’t bother, he’s jaded as fuck and is only here to argue.
---
Do Hunters really fall off that hard?
---
I was thinking about coming back to the game and leveling up a hunter but I keep hearing about how they're going to suck more and more as better gear gets released.
---
You can hate the game all you want, its a 15 year old game thats going to have some archaic mechanics. If you don't like it don't play it but it's not really an excuse to go tinkering with everything in my opinion.
---
Any suggestions on INT gear?
---
Well Id hope its harder then MC.  MC is so insanely boring.
---
This was obviously more for guilds not just open rolling every drop
---
Haha, grabbing +1 agi over start or int. That's BiS lists for you..
---

You must be horde.
---
Isn't blizzard owned by chinese? Makes the question irrelevant
---
Blizzard did this for MONEY. They don’t care about you, they care about MONEY. In case you didn’t get that: MONEY.
---
Liked this better when it was a huge thread on the bliz forums. That said, never played private servers and haven't played wow since bc but I generally agree with some of your points regarding classic. It's unfortunate, the lack of foresight on Bliz's part. However, long queues for BGs were inevitable when so many pvpers rolled horde without considering the obvious: there's only two sides, can't have all the players on one side without causing a delay in matchmaking. That wasn't bliz, that one is on us.
---
The trash is harder than most of the bosses
---
How?
---
100% - so many people use the same damn password everyday. I think theres a website called haveibeenpwned or something of the kind that will tell you places on the internet your information has been mass-dumped. 
---
"Pwned on 12 [breached sites](https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#DataSource)" for me, but I use a generic password for unpaid accounts and a unique one for everyone else. I haven't had any issues with hackers in years just doing that and avoiding dumb, sketchy sites. I don't even use an anti-virus (they used to use all my CPU years ago)
---
Zynga, Zomato, XboxISO, WarInc, Nextgen I don't remember signing up to any of this shit cause it was so long ago but the info is out there.
---
1.12 also drastically increased the threat of warriors so they could maintain their lead above the higher damage output of players in naxx gear.    Threat was a much bigger concern in vanilla than it is now.   Rogues had to use vanish to drop threat back then.
---
I mean I suppose if you ignore 95% of the game it is, but then so is warcraft.
---
Why would Biizzard Enterteinment ban one of their own employees?????
---
/s
---
I'm not sure I'd rely on a "well, *technically*" in cases like this.
---
Spell bashing somehow with master demonologist?  Dunno
---
No relevance for "needing" for an alt - if everyone is needing for greed it is a separate case.
---
How about using the on-screen keyboard? I can't remember what led me to think this way but if I ever need to use a card on a computer or device I don't trust (more like my families devices not public computers) then I will use the on-screen keyboard.
---
I was told it helped against keyloggers but that was probably a decade ago now.
---
Its not a perfect plan...
---
Removing actuall players to get more spots for bots, smart...
---
In your opinion, what is the preferred way to air grievances against the current state of the game? Or should everyone just zip it and let Blizzard so what they're going to do?
---
&gt; I did the r14 grind in vanilla, and - gasp - I had a lot of fun while doing it. 
---
I don't believe this and if you arent lying thats really sad
---
because we want to PvP
---
1) stumbled across it
---
2) people need to realize how scummy blizz is and that you are willingly eating shit from them
---
You'll be saving for a looong timea
---
I feel like the first private server of classic ever launched was terrible and barely playable. Private servers now are only good from so much trial and error. This is the first time Blizzard ever recreated a game of their's. For that reason, I'm gonna cut them some slack.
---
At level 49, level 41 mobs are green. Level 40 are grey.
---
What? Perfect drops equal \~16,3g in vendor loot. That times 5 is 81,5g. And getting all 3 bosses within 11 minutes should be doable for anyone with alright gear. Then add random greys and shit from the bosses, and the herbalism stuff. You always get AT LEAST 1 ghost mushroom, that's 1g per run, usually 2. Blind weed should be AT LEAST 2 nodes with an average of 2 per node, but let's say minimum of 1 per node for arguments sake. Minimum loot value from bosses per run is \~5,2g. So with the absolute worst luck in drops it's 33g/h. It literally can't go below that unless you're slow as fuck. Now let's say we're lucky in herbs instead. 2 ghost mushrooms, 4 nodes of blindweed with 3 per node. With absolute highest luck in Maraudon we then have \~103,5 G/h. I have no idea where you got 60g/h from.
---
Oh, totally. We had another pally with Ravager, and his AOE procs unsheeped mobs at least a half dozen times. Had to remind him that he was the healer lol
---
You do realize honor is comparative right? My honor scraps are plenty, sadly with your WSGs you’ll probably fall behind. Been building my gold back up too, it’s not so bad. 
---
Thinking the horde built this entire situation is like thinking the British had no influence in the Indian/Pakistan conflict.
---
I juat threw a stack full on the ground. Such a waste of bag space.
---
Lol so many jelly people.
---
&gt; so what would you say to someone who doesn’t like levelling? Just don’t play WoW?
---
I would say that if the reward is not worth the effort, and if you cannot play without being toxic, then don't play.  I don't like doing work, but I like getting paid - that's why I don't work for fun.  I wouldn't work if I didn't have to.  Nobody has to play WoW, it's not your job.  You don't need your PvP gear or raid gear to put food on the table.  If the rat race of the game is making you a toxic asshole who spends hours a day trudging through unenjoyable gaming, it's time for you to quit and find something else that you love.  Holy hell nobody is making you play world of warcraft.
---
&gt; champions (?)
---
Heroes.
---
That's one way of looking at it. A better way to describe it is that you are literally running two differentoperating systems at the same time. Imagine wow in windowed mode. change whatever is in that window to an entirely different operating system filled with different data and applications. That's basically what a virtual machine is. Kind of like what picture in picture is for TVs
---
Whatever is minimum system requirements for wow is probably what you want. Before you go this route look into whether or not running Windows would change how wow and your "3d card" interact
---
Mate, they're just asking for an improvement (at least in their eyes). Nobody's being tortured.
---
Yes! This happened to me, I logged in from a second account to find out that my character was running around Scholozar basin with some kind of teleport / flying bot. It would TP to the next node, and then on and on.
---
I figured out when they logged out - it was like 3-4AM my time and then at 2 I jumped on, changed my password and had about 20k + a guild bank full of herbs and ore. It was fucking amazing and has never happened again.
---
you care about improving. That's good.
---
The blunt truth is, you will not improve in this environment. You need people that are significantly better than you to push you to improve, and also people that care about improving. I don't get that sense from your group - if they did, they'd bring the barest minimum of consumes and show initiative like you did to figure out what they are doing wrong.
---
You'd be better off farming your pre-bis + organized pugging (generally, these will have signups, tank/cc/heal assignments, and mandatory consumes - look for ones with ideally sub 90 minute cleartimes) - this will at least put you in an environment with people that want to improve themselves, and generally you can find yourself a guild among such a crowd.
---
Finally, learn to combat log yourself - its probably the single most important tool to getting better, since it provides an unparalleled level of detail for analyzing your fights.
---
I like this idea and thanks for summing it up so simply. Gonna pitch this idea for my guild.
---
So in this same train of thought, dealing with the massive problem of faction imbalance should be made an exception for until the issue is in a better state
---
People still need Jed? Lol that’s so September 2019
---
If anyone has to switch - i've been Horde since 2005' when I started playing. I didn't pick them for the PvP bonus' so I just want to say "Shotgun NOT switching" :P
---
GMs will see them partying with a bot and will probably at least slap them with a suspension for directly benefiting from a third party script. Maybe if it's just a few minutes or a little while they'll just assume it's all innocent, or they'll see the guy was sending whispers to his friends lol'ing it up that bots are dumb and know they had knowledge of it/it wasn't innocent.
---
Why is blizzard going to ban itself dummy!
---
What if capping all 4 towers gave more honor?
---
if you count satyrs you could get some in darkshore, havent played a nelf since 2007 tho so I dont know what level they are. might not be possible to get to 20 but if you're a purist I don't think its possible
---
You don't seem to understand the back end stuff going on.  Most of your complaints are strictly server related. Sure timeline and patch squabbles are up for debate but all the #nochangers gave blizz literally no room to do anything different. With that said they definitely mismanaged everything else.
---
 Blizzard has far more server infrastructure demands than p servers which is why they can't host as much on the front end(our end). Blizzard takes far more logs than p server and runs on a more reliable(less buggy) codebase. Besides, the sheer amount of bugs on p servers is insane compared to classic. Classic servers may not feel as powerful on the front end but that's because they're more powerful on the back end.

I think they look at it in the sense of if the guy would have gotten away with it, the money would have entered the economy anyways.
---
And it makes the guy who has probably had to go a few days or weeks locked out of their account happy when they finally get to log in and see they're rich lol.
---
Because you made a smart ass remark from what I see
---
Watch you get banned for exploiting LOL
---
No, just some light theory crafting that has no plausible evidence to support it.
---
I see what did there. Noice.
---
I need to join an alliance EU cross-realm premade. I will play at least 3 hours a day, lmk if you can put me in touch with anyone.
---
Yeah but on the other hand you have countless private servers that up and vanished into thin air. As a more casual player, it takes me months to achieve what other do in a week. I’ll pay the $15 just to be secure in knowing my account won’t disappear.
---
you dont have 4 Alts on lvl 60? Lol casual
---
There's nothing wrong with that, you do you. Most people have already leveled their mains/alts at this point though and finding groups as a lower level, is going to be easiest with a supportive guild.
---
True. Shield slam didn't even give threat until Nax. It was a broken talent when it was implemented. That meant classes like DPS warriors had SEVERE threat issues and mages really had to watch their threat if they went arcane frost. 
---
Add to that 1.8/1.9 prob increased threat as well due to the drastic changes to one handers. WoW Classic is basically "Vanilla timewalking" and people who think they are doing real Vanilla raids are simply delusional. Naxx will be close to legit but I'm sure Naxx was nerfed to. I guess you could try doing them without world buffs and consumables up the arse and you will get a real vanilla raid experience. People didn't have 20,000 gold stockpiled by then. They were flat broke because previous raids all required consumes, repairs and people had to spend 100 gold to respec between pve and pvp on many classes like mage or rogue. Naxx will be facerolled with stockpiled consumes though. The only thing limiting a day 1 clear is gold, which you should have plenty of due to all the nerfs in previous content.
---
Fuck them seriously. It's not his bot lol
---
&gt; Spell batching, melee leeway, nerfed AV, incorrect animations, zone phasing lag thanks to the shit modern engine, (and previously layering) have significantly watered down the experience for me. 
---
thats all vanilla experience.  
---
Im not sure what do you mean by "zone phasing lag", i do not have that problem.
---
US Army forced us to use on-screen keyboards, except where I used it, the computer monitor was projected onto a smart board so everyone in the room just had to avert their eyes whenever someone logged in.
---
Tight security.
---
The bots aren't getting banned.  There's no way they'd ban OP when they've ignored these bots for months.
---
Noone expected to be the only on farming. Everyone who was "serious" about ranking knew it was going to be a grindy shitshow. The system simply forces you to play whatever is the most efficient. And AV is just way anove anything else. Blaming the players for playing the only viable way they can compete is kind of missing the issue.
---
&gt;tank warriors likely don't get to roll on big damage items
---
Not saying you're wrong, but this hasn't been my experience running my alts in pugs.
---
I'm sure that happens way more than people just being greedy.
---
Nostalrius has a fraction of the players playing.
---
Well they were intending to sell the gold but in both our cases we logged in / got the account back before they could do so.
---
I imagine it was a teleport hack mixed with a bot so im sure it was a minor nuisance at most. Back in WoTLK we had Gatherbuddy which was pretty sick, it would fill your bags with ores and herbs then run to the Guild Bank - chuck it in (if you set it to that) and go back to farming.
---
I'd make 15-20k a day botting anyway.
---
&gt;What makes classic WOW great is the journey
---
[Why thank you, I try :)](https://i.imgur.com/SAr7EUq.png)
---
Welcome to the club! Being a fresh 60 feels great because there is so much new content and pretty much every item that drops is an upgrade.
---
I don't need Jed anymore but some of my guildies do.  I'm an engineer too.  Gonna try this next time I get a chance to sit down and play. Thanks for the tip.
---
why would you open with a fear after seduce? you should be seducing CoE soulfire searing pain agony fear corruption siphon life. that should be the opner imo. i almost never lose this matchup with succ out
---
Except large pvp battles also happened. At least 24/7 the first week. Cities were invaded. It stopped after 2nd week though, since people were too afraid of DK‘s. I think those civilian npc should either not be targetable by aoe spells or even not be targetable at all.
---
really not that useful aside from spamming rank 1 arcane explosion on like 15+ mobs to get some mana back
---
Nevre been a big fan of blizzard, used to despise them even. That said I've been having a great time in classic so far as a new player who hasn't played wow before. This is still a MMO experience that I haven't had in any other games, and while I don't doubt that original vanilla or even private servers may have been a more vanilla experience, I still think that classic is wonderful and that many others have and still are sharing a great experience. Of course, there are still things blizzard needs to do better. 
---
Comparison to the original game or private servers is normal, it's harder to take things at face value if you've already played vanilla a bunch of times through the years with different private servers or even way back. I feel like most comments in this thread come from people who played on pservers consider that blizzard is ruining there game, but lets not forget all the new people that got to experience classic for the first or second time and who are still enjoying the game for what it is.
---
&gt; even if you rank slower
---
That's the thing, it's not about ranking slower, it's about being able to reach rank 10 at all. You would have to no life WSG to compete with hobbyists in AV.
---
Ah okay
---
i have sold over $8000 worth of wow gold and 0 bans. 
---
blizzard doesnt give a shit
---
My job is ethical hacking/pentesting and this is exactly how and why accounts get hacked all of the sudden. People use the same email and password combo on numerous other sites/games that probably had a databreach at some point.
---
The safest would be to use a unique email/password for bnet only and have 2fa enabled.
---
To be fair, there weren't horde in or but there were 4-5 alliance groups on the way from Mojache to Dm and 1-2 groups roaming around in the courtyard as well.  That's just p2 in a nutshell to popular farming spots
---
Played ESO for almost 2 years and would definitely recommend the community. It’s truly awesome. Plus you don’t get much of the min-max mentality bullshit we have on WoW. Others will accept you no matter your race or gear.
---
ur months behind so finding other dungeons is going to take a lot lot lot more time. if u already done the classic dungeons, i suggest you just skip them and level via quest
---
The one that pops up in the middle of your screen when a cooldown is ready again?
---
Undead male warrior, the armour and swing animations are sick, plus I love the shout/change stance animations too.
---
Yeah that might be the one. The one usually after broodlord
---
Yeah, did the same with one of these naga farmers the other day while grinding them a bit to level. Found out if I assisted with the kill versus only tagging I’d get about 1% every 90 seconds. Only one golden pearl but adding up the value of it (15g on my server) and the drops I probably denied the bot about 35g too.
---
Didnt play much nost but did play alot of lb/nd and they were the true vanilla experience
---
all i did was facilitate wc and sfk runs with my 5 mains with my play time and parked them in the 20s not yet advanced out of that tier.
---
me is baby yoda looking up at scarlet monastery from there.
---
thats the game as i learned to love it at the end of classic running Strat dead and scholo all the time.
---
havent done anything else yet, remain subscribed and log in to run it another time every now and then.
---
How does one reach the summit?  I’ll head up there and pay my respects.
---
That's what I'm thinking as well. Except my guild doesn't have any 2H fury, so I am thinking that if I just shrug off the fact that they're accepting of a somewhat less optimal DPS (since DW does deal more damage) I can be 2H fury and get better weapons that will literally be uncontested by the other warriors in my guild.
---
3 weeks 5k gold at a modest 50gph assuming you waste literally 0 time and are always making gold means you spent 100 hours farming, or 33 hours per week doing nothing but farming gold for a weapon. That’s 5 hours a day for 3 weeks assuming you spend all of those hours making 50 gold per hour which you definitely aren’t doing. It’s a pretty big grind. Not r14 bad but the vast majority of people don’t want to be pigeonholed into 5 hours of farming a day to get a PvP weapon.
---
I remember they changed at some point in wrath if I'm not mistaken. Guess they overlooked it in classic huh.
---
At least you could still buy GM/HWL weapons before 60 and then equip it as you ding in WSG, fun times.
---
Not to be a dick or anything (because I agree with you)
---
But it's spelled rite
---
Classical scams
---
If you can get to 10, and do WSG and kill only nelfs you can. The mark turn in quest gives xp
---
I'm convinced that there is gonna be a F R E S H private server project that pops up once classic has nearly run its course that wins back the hardcore community.  There is a huge market for a proper vanilla wow experience and blizz has failed to provide it so far.
---
This is a prime reason to sever transfer. Make some lvl 1s on different servers and seek a guild
---
You should do that, it's what im doing. I'm in a very similiar situation as you and i have rationalized my best bet is to grind for Unstoppable Force until OEB or Bonereaver or Spinal drops for me, and I am up priority because of the lack of 2h warr's in our guild
---
By that logic Night Elves are just purple trolls.
---
It hasn't been 15 years playing wow for everyone (including myself) but this shit right here is basic internet culture, a bit of trolling is part of the nature of the beast
---
Yeah, they spilled coffee on their lap five games in a row.  I see the same guy doing the same thing.  AFK sympathizer.  No one needs you.
---
Genius. Still need that wand.
---
I am so glad I had the chance to play on Nostalrius. It was 100% a much more authentic and much, much more fun experience..
---
But that's almost a given, when their devs (and owners) actually cared about the game.
---
Blizzard is literally the definition of corporate greed and every mistake they have made so far have been so painfully predictable.
---
I will definitely /who you when Im on thats sure :D
---
It doesn’t even take that long to farm it. People dumping $ into gear and professions before their epic mount are clueless.
---
Happy kek day
---
Honestly, that’s the most fun part of the game for me. Sure, I could enjoy the journey or whatever people are still spouting, but I’m 60 with full bis except one raid item. I took my time getting there, but now I’m there, and I’m still enjoying the game, just in a different way than you. You should be okay with that.
---
Not sure the Chinese would object to their players not being allowed to play/interact with North Americans. 
---
They'd probably consider that a win.
---
That puts you in a very small minority. I would say a normal good speed is 2.5-3 hours, getting closer to 2 hours the longer the guild has been raiding. Sub 2 hours is pretty damn fast, and sub 1 hour is insane for a normal raiding guild.
---
It was way faster for me to grind in winterspring and epl. I went from 59-60 in 6 hrs just grinding mobs.
---
What's a caster ult?
---
Yes, however rogues can "stretch" their dollar, due to the fact that you can fall back on stun locks and have escape tools (Blind gouge vanish etc..).  
---
  
---
A warrior who gets in over their head is just fucking dead.
---
Nost had a lot more, lol. Not only that, their realm had no downtime. It was 6k pop at its lowest player count during the day and peaked at 13k+.
---
That's significantly larger than most classic realms.
---
How to fish for Jed 100% as a Priest without any unnecessary items:

/target Blackhand Elite. It's always there.

Look for Jed.

I agree with you.
---
That's why people were looking forward for Classic. But they got fucked in the ass instead by Blizzard.
---
Didn’t even notice.
---
Thank you Jimmi!
---
username checks out
---
That’s assuming the current standings continue to shake out at the current clip. In 3 months from now the threshold for R10 is going to be lower than it currently is, because the majority of try-hards will have moved on.
---
After looking into it a bit, I walk away with a couple impressions. 
---
1. If you look here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7czdqb/alterac_valley_15_111_timeline/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share , people seemed to have mixed feelings about how Nost handled AV. So I'm not sure how I feel with respect to the bulk of the post, as those comments paint a completely different picture. I'm not saying you're wrong, just that I've never played Nost and don't have any first hand experience to feel one way or another.
---
2. When I was playing classic (perhaps 6-9 months pre-BC), I remember some AV games lasting *days*. These games would have both boss baddies summoned on both sides multiple times in some cases. But one summon was a common enough thing. I remember the tower guards being somewhat a bitch to kill, and that a decent chunk of the raid had to be disseminated to kill the guard towers, defend graveyards, etc. This made AV so fucking awesome for me. It almost really felt like I was taking orders and helping a battalion of people see victory. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like current AV has people just skipping everything and zerging (I'm 49 so I can't do them yet to know for sure, but my you get brother is 60 and he makes it sound like a zerging spree with all the honor he claims to get). This breaks AV for me, and I think I'll end up walking away feeling let down if this is indeed how AV is currently set up. 
---
That being said, after having looked at that link above, it does seem like th old style AV I remember, may not have been all that great from a population stand point. I don't rightly remember how packed each server was. Only that AV games had us playing objectives and that the battles felt epic (although this may be nostalgia / Rose colored glasses, not sure). 
---
So I'm honestly not sure where to stand. Can anyone pitch in here to help me understand the details of each approach? Pros and Cons?
---
yaaah that's why classic has a lot more bots than private servers, :)
---
You'd leveling from exploring new areas.
---
Saved.... Leveling a priest and this is top notch info.
---
Only advantage of selling it now is for hunters leaf quest. I think it will go up but not anything dramatically. If your expecting it to double or something like that don’t. It wont. Maybe 10-20g more tops
---
Muh private servers
---
Then you are foolish as well as selfish. If you are rolling on an item with the intention to sell it for profit, that is the definition of greed. By your logic, everybody should just roll need on everything and vendor the BoP's we can't use because we all need money. That is how stupid you sound.
---
If you didnt want me to attack you your name wouldnt be red.

A mage this good clearly uses a CPAP
---
This is exactly it, it's easy to micro-analyze a 15 year old game.
---
Because the private servers had experience with running vanilla for like a decade, but everyone was busy spamming \#NOCHANGES spearheaded by clueless fucking twitch streamers and people drolling from nostalgia without playing the game for 15 years.
---
The private servers also realized that 1.12.1 talents and itemization has a significant impact on the game, and altough they couldn't do anything about the talnets (since most pservers don't do modified clients) they at least started 1.7 itemization which is basically a nerf to all classes.
---
The \#nochange movement are the biggest offenders, and they were the largest voice. Ofcourse Blizzard listened, as by that request they had to put in the minimal amount of effort to actually theorize the game (or just literally copy private server tuning).
---
Still slower
---
You lost young blood?
---
Yup. There's a reason why all the complaining posts seem to be from players who rushed to 60, zerged pre-bis nonstop, camped flightpaths in phase 2 and lived in AV in the first week.
---
Me and my buddies are still in our 40s and having a total blast. We don't even want to hit 60, given how much complaining we see on this subreddit from people who hit 60 months ago. 
---
The leveling process really the game here.
---
Is that 404: Rend Not Found?
---
&gt;Also OP, +18 or up to 18?
---
It literally means the same thing. The up to 18 is on specific spell type gear, and the 18 is on spell damage and healing.
---
They functionally have no difference other than one works for only one school of magic, and the other works on all schools of magic and healing.
---
You can - that item is one of the few you don't need the prof to equip - but I'm not familiar, do locks often use that trinket?
---
Classicwow must mean something different in the gay community.
---
My hero
---
Nostalrius had Devs and owners that cared about the game. Blizzard doesn't. Blizzard is just a greedy, corporate (and publicly) company that doesn't care to spend a single dollar on the game.
---
Nost put a lot of effort and man hours into perfecting research, upkeep and authenticity.. lot's of GMs and staff.
---
Blizzard is only putting effort into saving money where they can, and that's it.
---
ah wrong sub I guess
---
Im not looking to save 3 seconds
---

Cool.  No one cares.

[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95YXxO2cZ8s)
---
It’s for sure possible. That’s how I leveled my pally. It is slightly less boring than right clicking mobs to death as ret.
---
You can basically just watch any mage aoe video to find the best spots to level.
---
You need shield spike and prot spec plus consecrate from the holy tree before this is really viable. But you could start around level 33ish in arathi highlands. 
---
Basically you will just seal of light and melee mobs down while they take your thorn damage. You will have to experiment to see if you can get away with other seals. Very gear dependent. Eventually when you get seal of wisdom you can pepper that in to lower your down time, but I would say you are probably going to be drinking after most fights regardless. You will want mainly stamina and intellect, as you won’t be dealing too much damage with your weapon, but inevitably you will have lots of strength as the available gear is mostly containing strength. You want to prioritize armor, defense, stamina, intellect mainly.
---
The most important thing is pulling the absolute maximum number of mobs you can without dying. This will greatly increase your efficiency. You will be able to kill 4 mobs in roughly the same amount of time as you can kill 1 mob, so pulling fewer mobs is clearly a huge hit to efficiency. You will have to learn this through trial and error, but just start small and work your way up. Basically your goal will be to pull so many mobs each pull that when they are all dead you are at very low hp and mana. 
---
Good luck
---
Gnomes have escape artist brah same thing
---
Well I think you should do shaman simply because it's a class you're not used to and they also have some decent class quests later on.
---
Well both places have twinks and lots of leather harnesses, but I’m afraid that’s where the similarities end
---
Ah yes that makes perfect sense, thank you
---
does it give XP after first turn in?
---
When you create the item set you can filter which items should be included (raid, dungeon, world etc)
---
Alt will respark that joy podsibly. Yet also, you don't play as much, and that's usually a good thing lol
---
Damn.  Are profits so low that they have to resort to scamming their own customers as a side gig?
---
100% correct, its astounding blizz has done so badly compared to a server hosted in a basement in romania
---
leaving only the PvE yes.
---
what make you think adding a shit ton more NPC will make the PvP worth it?
---
Welcome to Classic. Remember, you asked for this.
---
No. I apply different logic to BoE items than BoP items because it simoly makes sense. Everyone needs gold equally and the boe item is literally just a bag of gold.
---
hahahah
---
its gone now, LH was shut down when classic launched iirc
---
bruh i remember not being able to play a melee class on nost because mob location was desynced between the server and client. i remember the atrocious pet pathing. i remember the completely wrong elite damage. you just have more fun with nost for whatever reason... nostalgia or w/e idk. it was objectively at best a less stable version of what we have now.
---
Spells learnt before lvl20 have a penalty to SP coeficient.
---
Hey there,
---
I share the grievances of your message but the post has already garnered several reports under Rule 4. Could you please remove the names of Private Servers in your post to prevent auto-moderators or other mods from removing it.
---
As for the post, yeah the handling of Classic - particularly the AV situation hasn't inspired much hope for Classic+.  AV provided an opportunity to create a hybrid version of earlier and later patches in the time between Classic Release and AV release. Instead a few months just saw a handful of bug fixes, and hundreds more not acknowledged (Paladin Consecration still needs a word for any Blizzard staff reading this!)
---
5%
---
Yes. Again. Words don’t mean what they mean, despite you using a dictionary definition as part of your earlier argument.
---
Is it fun to be a needlessly argumentative gatekeeper?
---
Eh, I know what he means.  Before BGs we raided Org a lot, and the Zone line was a known deathtrap by both factions.  You would lag for 4-5 seconds regardless of hardware and almost always die.
---
Say that everyone did research classic like you suggest. Then what? Everyone rolls horde and then all servers become PVE because no1 would roll Alliance for PVP.  Why not change the root of the problem?
---
Not in vanilla though most dodgy shit was goiing on with tbc and wotlk
---
Does Blizzard look for patterns of something so benign to try and determine that there is griefing intent? Doubtful.
---
I'm not an AFK sympthizer, I'm just being realistic. AFKing is lame. No one needs your bias and drama in a conversation that could be had with logic. Fuck outta here.
---
Do you realize how hard people fight for upgrades such as 2% crit? Why would any capable guild bring ppl along that are too lazy to spend ~100g for such a large upgrade. 
---
 You have people that dont lose out like healers making flasks and such.  Or I dunno make an alt if it's that important.
---
You can get away with that kinda stuff in mediocre guilds. The people that bring your mindset will struggle hard in naxx and wont ever parse well.
---
im using rank 3 which allows me to MC up to level 64 which these mobs are
---
Anyone who gets had by one of these scams, or gets their account hacked fully deserves it.  It means they failed to secure their account, put their details in somewhere hella shady, tried breaking the tos, or didn't pay attention.
---
Nost doesn't exist anymore. It's history.
---
Try hard.
---
You’re totally right, and I agree 100%. The way that I look at is if you do indeed hit level 60, than you are level 60 for a long long time, as compared to the sliver of time you are level 40.
---
Damn that’s some next lvl slavery
---
Keep flexing it's funny
---
Is this subreddit owned by Blizzard?
---
I'm well aware. Interpretation and enforcement of rules is not universally the same however so I'm advising OP to give the best chances of the post remaining.
---
I did a druid during actual classic retail... But I did balance rip. Eventually did respec feral around 50 though
---
If it is then I'm still waiting for my paycheck.
---
https://wago.io/WFI-OVL05 weakaura that whispers you when queue pop
---
I'd say its much harder, especally if you are a class officer/raid leader.
---
I think using nost as an example is kinda whack, considering it was one of the worse vanilla private servers
---
But why shouldn't you be allowed to mention vanilla private servers?
---
They should always be referenced and compared to classic, and those there were the servers that made classic happen in the firstplace.
---
Blizz removes posts on their forums mentioning private servers, but why should that be the case on reddit?
---
Yup!
---
I believe they made the decision in order to incentivize the hardcore minority (and anyone else with similar aspirations of ranking glory) away from ruthlessly camping the ever-living shit out of the opposing faction.
---
Most concur that phase 2 pvp was not a healthy mode of existence.  But I think they did have to make a decision and chose to do so without addressing the phase 2 problem directly.
---
Lots of honor in AV = lots of people in either their own capital cities or a remote locale to re-queue - rather than in the opposing faction's capital cities fucking people up upon landing from contested territory.
---
I'd much rather piss and moan about AV not being perfect than the majority of the world people an impassable fortress guarded by neckbeards with no qualms making life miserable for everyone in order to secure incremental gains on a weekly basis.
---
I saw some horde player from another server with over 900k honor in AV, according to one of those honor spy announcements in chat.  He was standing 66 on his server for the prior week and in bracket 12 of 14.
---
What does everyone think he would be doing if not being holed up in AV for over 90 hours that week?
---
We all know those people that shouldn't be allowed out in public for one reason or another.  Just be glad these people are confined to their literal and proverbial homes, and willingly so.  I dont want to run into these people in the grocery store, and I dont want to run into them outside of AV.
---
been doing this from day 4?. just go in the corner you can target him :P
---
There's something wrong with his medulla oblongata
---
The rule existed long before I became a mod and I actually received a ban for accidentally linking a pserver item dB. I don’t make the rules here.
---
Why would blizzard ban its own account?
---
But you're actually farming for them, it's gotta be for a reason.
---
And stop acting like opening 3 doors and killing one fire dude before you get to arena is hard.
---
I feel like 2 hour MC is probably about the norm at this point.  Anyone thinking a sub 1 hour MC is normal is clearly having a very different experience, and has no reason to even be concerned with the main question of this post.
---
Hopefully someone ninjas your 400g BiS boe and you can learn your lesson the hardway.
---
&gt;You clearly violated the rules man.
---
And so did the 3 links I provided. The rule mentions nothing about evidence. In fact it clearly states names must be blurred, yet the very titles of the threads have the offenders name in them.
---
Proof is being uploaded
---
Mage t2 8 piece is insane.
---
Been doing this for ages and making spyglasses for guildies after they started wondering how I always knew if he was spawned instantly.
---
&gt; WTF folder
---
What is this one?
---
Ah yeah, great idea just moving the entire folder structure -- I may just do that.
---
1.) it was lagging, but nothing compare to blizzard shit show with 100v100
---
2.) yes, abit more then what blizzard did while w ranking was going on?  
---
3) no they didnt, it was old AV, you had to have warrior with shield wall infront to surv archers. and everyone needed to use fap before going through the gauntlet....
---
4) ye that one was abit yikes  
---
5) cant remeber that much lag going from zone to zone but server crashed alot at 11k+
---
6) cant really say, cant remeber.
---
Funny, horde wins like 80% of the AVs I'm in nowadays
---
I am planning 4/5 slam. I think the best is OEB but I could be wrong. The orc factor is the only thing that makes Spinal somewhat competitive for an orc. There are some easy to get hit gear pieces out there u can stack, it is more important to be at cap than build other offensive stats
---
&gt; You are delusional.
---
Coming from a person that can't make a quick google search.
---
Some classes like warriors and druids kind of have to...if I'm dps warrior and I end up tanking...in still rolling on dps gear MS.
---
What's that mean exactly?  Just failing to kill him?  I honestly never really got into BWL in vanilla.  Just MC/Ony and the 20 mans.
---
Any tips on finding a guild I can tank in? Heartseeker.
---
I rerolled from my mage because it bored me to tears, and found a love for tanking. I recently hit 60 with my warrior but I can't find a guild that needs one.
---
My raid times are limited (m/f/sun) and so is my knowledge (classic was my first experience with wow.)
---
So I know it's stacked against me, especially considering most guilds have their tank line set up already. However, I work hard, I do my research and try to do my best and am consistent for raid timings. 
---
More to the point , any specific suggestions for finding a guild that might suit me?
---
I've tried lfg in /world, posted to my servers discord, and been on the lookout for 2 weeks but no luck so far. I've been offered spots in multiple guilds as a fury warrior but that really doesn't interest me.
---
I would never buy gold, but this is the one situation that would tempt me.
---
It's true that Hunters do fall off as the patches move on. As far as I'm aware this is a PvE issue, not a PvP one or one that afflicts solo grinding.
---
Whaaaaaahhhhh... /Shrug Still having fun.
---
If you wanna get crazy you can cast pain before the mb to maximize its dps
---
you're right, no one should want a paid experience to be better than the free one. It should be literally illegal to have constructive criticism of anything, I can't believe people are so entitled.
---
I would argue the paladin would get more benefit from it. It is a great healing weapon, and it is a great 5 man tanking weapon.
---
Better efficient healers means you can roll with more dps and clear faster.
---
Also imagine "airing grievances" over 50 cents a day, that's some entitled shit.
---
Been thinking this but honestly the biggest thing is leveling time. I’m burnt out after leveling a shaman. What was your /played if you don’t mind me asking?
---
From memory the number is closer to 70%. 2FA almost removes the need for passwords, and in fact Google have been favouring 2FA over password authentication (at least for Pixel users, you can login with just username and phone).
---
The pre-shared key model needs to end. WebAuthN is the way to do that \^.\^
---
Lock has more DPS potential in the long run but can be tedious with having to farm shards and summon people every raid.
---
reddit is trash and mods make it worse, more at 11
---
Fuck people like you.
---
Fair enough.
---
You are just full blown pepega. The mods need to delete this thread, the idiocy is infectious and your protesting is invalid.
---
Sometimes I organize trivia contests with my guild and gift people 16 slots bags. I would have my epic mount if I saved those pennies, but I’d rather imagine the happy faces of those lowbies who win. Who’s the leader of Ironforge? Why do you have to kill Hogger in Elwynn? Where can you find Kharan? Be the first to answer and get a free bag!
---
It would be so easy to automatically suspend such accounts or just reset their rank progress.
---
Could I use this to find Spirestone Battle Lord? I still need the Blackrock Slicer
---
It used to be a dismounted only city until enough people complained about r in the forums then blizzard changed it. Riding a kodo through that place means you get stuck in the damnedest places.
---
dident some guild argue that this was better for mages so they where not a priority on the loot council for mageblade.
---
Pallies are casters
---
Why is this funny wtf
---
You say as much, but what argument have you offered besides that you disagree? I asked a question, so why do you respond like a petulant child? Is it perhaps because your only reason is your own entitlement?
---
Good I'm a druid
---
Exactly the response I expected when you got shot with facts in your face. 
---
Sit down, thanks
---
We could start by not having pvp players roll horde and pve players roll alliance. Racials are off and skewed, so are shamans vs paladins. Alliance players have 100% given up any hope of winning, so 10 people are afk every match, so it's 40 horde vs 30 alliance unless it's a premade.
---
I would personally love to really give it a go, but I've given up any will to actually attempt to win when everyone else don't even try. So I've stopped trying as well unless it's actually a premade. I'm currently trying to find a premade group so I can do actual pvp, as the current PUG AV has zero pvp as an alliance warrior.
---
When you try to compare apples to oranges I am going to throw the oranges back at you.
---
I once had someone get into my account and they had the audacity to open a ticket and say my account had been hacked (before they did anything), idk what the outcome was with that, but then they proceeded to vendor all my stuff, take all my gold, etc. When I tried reporting that I'd been hacked, they said they had already taken care of it. It took a little extra work, but I did finally convince them it wasn't me who made the initial ticket, and everything got fixed
---
That's the thing that pisses me off the most. People can just spam AV all day and rank without ever having to play pvp.
---
Stop with the stupid whataboutism. What Microsoft does is equally wrong and has been subject of investigation.
---
Because passion always beats profit. It's that simple. Many of the guys running Private Servers did it because they love classic WoW. Sure there are some more shady private servers, but most people don't choose to run a server for potential profit. They run it because they love the game.
---
&gt;When I am presented with facts I have a meltdown and down know what to do
---
Yeah, I fixed that for you.
---
Warriors op
---
Hey bud, glad you like it. We've expanded on the original list a bit and have a current 'work in progress' version for Phase 3.
---

Cheers
---
My wife and I just count to 3 and both queue. We usually have to try a few times. If you’re Horde I’m not sure it would be worth trying :(
---
It’s definitely not bad if the goal isn’t rushing. There’s 1 sub hour run on my server so far (59 minutes and some change) and the logs show they were heavy on raid buffs. 
---
Two hours is a great time for a guild that isn’t trying to set a record. Anyone saying anything over 45 minutes is bad is out of touch with what most groups are doing
---
You're leveling in the wrong zone. Go to Darkshore or Loch Modan until you're lvl 14-15.
---
Found the retail zombie. Brave blizzard sheep.
---
People are toxic on alliance side because they lose almost 100% of their AV games. Horde would be toxic as well if they experienced the same.
---
Yes. That's what the OP is doing as well.
---
However, you need to wait to see if he's patting. OP is saying with the Spyglass you don't need to wait at all.
---
This version of AV was not even part of 10% of vanilla... This was legit in the final patch just before BC only. Wtf U talking about
---
Didn’t everyone hit p2 in Rag fights back then? I didn’t play but that’s what I heard
---
Feenix’s Emerald Dream realm disappearing hurt pretty bad.
---
What the fuck lol.
---
People downvoting me to oblivion instead of correcting me. What a wonderful world we live in. I'm curious too.
---
Int would be the best DPS increase anyway due to being able to cast another multishot or lower ranked AS.
---
Obviously if you're decking yourself out to be the very best using flasks, pots, runes et cetera than that 1 agi would be better but...
---
Is there a way to train my main pet new abilities without depositing it at a stable master, taming a new pet, learning the new ability, and then abandoning the new pet and teaching my main pet that new ability? Seems like there should be an easier way
---
Retard alert
---
I feel like you're far, far more likely to find a guild that raids on weekends.
---
In all of vanilla, tbc and classic i never saw a morning raiding guild.
---
This, well said. You don't NEED a BoE epic, even if it's your BIS. You'll do just fine without it.
---
&gt; Nevre been a big fan of blizzard, used to despise them even. That said I've been having a great time in classic so far
---
The game was made by the old blizzard, the one that wasn't universally hated. Moderm blizzard doesn't know how to make a game as good as original wow.
---
What the Alliance actually thinks
---
And I was only 2 silver pieces short of buying my first mount at level 60.
---
Yes, which realm and how much u gonna give away?
---
Some sped monkey gobbling blizzards nuts
---
Oneshot everything. All the way to naxx.
---
If you check Atlas you can see the other spot. You have to take the first left as you enter Strat UD. To check if he is there, you kill the first pack as you enter Strat UD, then you go left to the next side. Before you engage any other mobs - you can do "/target Skul" to see if he is there.  
---
So me and my guild mates will do 3-4 checks on the Strat UD, before running a full Strat UD (so we dont get locked out). All you gotta do is kill one pack, then check, then reset.
---
Low level queues aren't always instant for ally, my 19 twink has had some 25 min queues off peak.
---
A couple weeks ago we were basically on top of Jed before we realized he was even there (we had looked a couple times on the way there). 
---
The UBRS run at that time was really just for onyxia attunement, so Jed was a pleasant bonus. One of the guild mages got a Briarwood Reed :)
---
It's considered Real Money Trading (RMT) and it's 100%against both blizzard AND twitch TOS. You can't even do raffles on twitch.
---
Right that’s what I meant, the loot table is the same. The satyrs actually have higher chances since they are elites but you wanna be killing more things if you’re looking for big drops.
---
I've never had an AV que of more than 5 seconds. Maybe faction imbalances are the result of min/maxers who refuse to play Ally, and that some of these problems are completely your fault.
---
Read the rest of the thread. Ive offered plenty of arguments. I dont care to repeat myself to yet another scrub.
---
I made it up there this evening via help from youtube. I don't have a gun, but I did shoot some fireworks in your hunter friend's honor.
---
I'm currently 1 bar from level 60. This will be one of my final leveling memories, and certainly the most poignant. I am glad that I could share in this experience.
---
Fairbanks alliance pays tribute:

---
I used to enjoy AV.  It stopped being fun as horde though when most games started becoming alliance premades.  Now they have voice coms, and a fully coordinated strategy.  Trying to pvp doesn't work, because someone just yells over discord to get help.  Nothing we can do, except slow them down, or just get some bonus honor before they win in 10 or fewer minutes.
---
"Hey OP I'm actually having fun on Classic, I think the problem is you, not the game"
---
The only possible conclusion: SoulNZ plays retail WoW.
---
They made it as easy on themselves as possible to get a whole bunch of people back into the game and hoped many of them would get back into retail. It's blatantly obvious.
---
How. Are you rolling for gear or something? That seems insane under any system.
---
It's ,200 honor and the rep is about 400 lost but if it makes the game slower it's not worth it
---
I'll not pay my sub lol.
---
Just bot gold to pay for tokens. At around 15 free tokens so far.
---
Fuck blizzard
---
A botter saying fuck people like me? Youre actually a certified moron lol
---
They definitely are, Chromaggus has 1.9M health and nefarian 2.1.
---
Ragnaros has 1M health and most MC bosses 600k. fights like razorgore, nefarian have lot of  add phases in top of that.
---
Expect nefarian to be at least a 8/10 minutes fight for most guilds,  guilds back in the days could spend 20+ minutes on him lol
---
What a great nonanswer lol
---
Money.
---
It isn't just questionable sites. Telling people that leads to the "Well, I don't visit such sites, so obviously I don't need to worry about it" mentality that I so often see.
---
My system was infected twice via flash based ads on perfectly legit sites before I disabled flash. Most online businesses with advertising subscribe to ad services, so their ads are only as secure as their ad provider. 
---
Fortunately, Flash is going the way of the dodo, but it's still worth remembering that even legit sites can get you in trouble.
---
I've seen a good number of pets get punted into the whelp cave without spawning any adds. I don't think they can, but YMMV.
---
I did that from 39-40 during vanilla. Was awesome! I think it was AB, so I ran off on my mount and capped LM before horde could get there!
---
...we lost handily. =/
---
Because self proclaimed statistics are totally reliable and absolutely not a lie.
---
Oh ok, you don't sympathize with AFKers but you decided to speak up on their behalf because the Knight-Commander who is in the cave every single really needed your support.  Because... he's clumsy and spills so much coffee he's nearly drown in it.
---
Orc warrior that i have now. Only way u get thunderfury is to be a warrior (rogue is pipedream and even if u get it its replaced in naxx) engi/alchemy so i can have the best profession and make my own consumes
---
I think having all quest scripting working (which no private server achieved) would have gotten them at least a little bit of credit.
---
Zzz
---
There is a Heal/Tank spec for druids https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05500302501, not sure about Paladins.
---
Druids can tank/off tank in Raids, Paladins not so much, due to mana issues and having no taunt - overall the Druid is the better tank. Pala is the better healer, although the beauty of classic is that they are different in how they heal or tank.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Not when youre a dps warrior for any phase.
---
probably more noticeable in AV becasue its extremely not fun to do that bullshit over and over again because its most efficient way to farm honour. some people do this like 15 hours a day, anyonne would be miserable after that
---
You need the key to get in the back door, but that’s it. I’ve pretty much lived in dmeast since it came out, have made close to 8k gold there
---
lmaooo show us the logs, i want to see those out dpsed fury warriors. without any logs this comment is like durr Im top dps in mc with 2h deep prot dps build.
---
&gt; Even AQ is nerfed due to shield slam threat
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Right now if you play solo queue Alliance you will loose after 50 minutes of Horde turtling and Alliance whatever-the-hell-they-are-trying-to-achieving. If you are playing on Horde you have 50% chance to get utterly destroyed by an Alliance premade in 6-10 minutes or 50% chance to be on the winning end of the cluster fuck previously described.
---
Obviously he can't speak for the behavior of every raid leader, but it's an accurate explanation. There are some 'exceptions' to this rule, like Onyxia's head, because it is just so good for tanks and DPS.
---
&gt;If this classic was released as a private server, it would be conpletely dead in under 2 weeks.
---
Rogues you need to keep up with weapons only.  Warriors need to keep up ALL gear
---
So I did what you said and looked at patches 1.8-1.10 and fury was essentially unchanged (if not nerfed) so is your argument that ppl were shit back then or what ? I don’t get it
---
Then go play private servers. Just seems like another blizzard hate post. Classic has been amazing.
---
Nah. We need less people like *you* here. Get out.
---
We use DKP and a lot of Rogue loot has dropped... Probs got most tier for min bid and was the only Raider-rank Rogue going daggers when perd+tooth dropped :P
---
Whichever is cheapest
---
ahh ye, thought it was known trick, you can also as a rogue/mage/druid go up to the door and instant target him, mage just go close to the 2 packs in the start, blink through them in the middle, you shouldnt get aggro and walk up there, just be careful of the pat
---
Priest can hop around with mind vision and spam a /tar skul macro in the 2 spots
---
Pretty mediocre. Most non speed run guilds on our server (including us) hovers 1.30-2h depending on the night.
---
It literally saves time and there is no downside to it except spending a couple silver to get it.  How is it a waste of time?
---
Sitting in that spot waiting for Jed to patrol to the right area is the waste of time...  Somehow you have this backwards.
---
Whichever group also attacks NEs should be tolerated for now imo
---
Shh let him pretend he’s cool.
---
It's not so much the fact that we're on 1.12.1, it's the fact that it's a 15 YEAR OLD game that everyone knows everything about and we're on computers that aren't running the game at 5 FPS like back in the day
---
With addons, insane game knowledge, much better computers, every raid will be cleared the first day of release, including Naxxramas ezpz, it's a 15 year old game mate.
---
By that point I'm sure some guilds had a phase 1 kill, but any guys that was capable of killing Ragnaros when BWL came out was probably usually doing it with one sons of flame phase.
---
Total population is kinda irrelevant since you run each server in parallel, it doesn't directly affect the performance of each server if you have 10k pop on one realm or 100k on ten.
---
Doing gods work 🙌
---
Yep there's only 2 possible spots. The square 1 west of ud entrance, then vision through the gate over to the tobacco shop area. The whole scout is 5-6 mind visions
---
Basically it actually, lol.
---
If you have many warlocks the other thing that can boost dps is a shadow priest shadow weaving, and deep frost mage boosting arcane frost mages wirh Winter's Chill debuff, but those don't have to be in the same group.
---
Not necessarily. I'm saying dont make a post about it, not that you cant *post* about it in comments or be happy in general. I just dont think we necessarily need to hear every single one of our happy stories of why we like the game. I give r/wow more shit for this because I dont think its the right platform to tell these campfire stories.
---
I support your endeavour, please let us know how it goes lol. What server are you on?
---
&gt;(thanks to the clueless #nochangers)

It's the blizzard devs are that clueless. Nost did the job fine, too bad a multi billion dollar company can't.

PlayTBC (lol).
---
Frozen Heart raids on friday nights.  I'm not a member, but I know a few of them in the real world and more from online, pretty decent people.  They're quite good at the game too, just too serious for me :)
---
I remember seeing a post on here a while back about the approximate average clear times for every dungeon and I was wondering if anyone knows where I can find it. 
---
Buddy and me aren't familiar with the late game dungeons and made the rookie mistake of starting a BRD at 11pm on a work night, so we're looking to try and avoid making similar mistakes in the future.
---
You shouldn't be below lvl12 before leaving Elwynn. You clearly missed  some quests. Also Westfall is hard. Alliance leveling is a clusterfuck if you don't want to grind a lot. I really really recommend Zygors leveling guide, although it does cost a small amount of money.
---
Lol okay boomer
---
A helluva feeling of accomplishment but theres also that feeling of "I have so much more to do."
---
Tank can do more threat, dps can do more dmg, boss dies much faster, healers don't go OOM. Threat was added/changed for Naxx because tanks woudn't have been able to hold thread on DPS races and casters were scaling really well. When put in AQ it will simply make the content much easier. Not to the extend the myriad of nerfs that were done to BWL/MC will, but it will still be much easier.
---
The "real" classic wouldnt have retained as big of a audiance as this version has.
---
youll be fine

You might be better off looking into transferring to an EU realm, it looks like the timezones line up perfectly. 11:00 PST is 20:00 CET, raid primetime on my server.

Of course not, but spending 6-7k on a weapon you'll upgrade the next raid seems mildly stupid, wouldn't you say? Unless you're a gold buyer of course.

You have it confused with punting people as a group, I'm talking you vs someone who is straight afking in the bg, the afk timer is 5 minutes, if they have been in the bg for longer than 5 minutes and they haven't moved, they're botting or intentionally afking the BG \^\_\^

Vanilla karazhan hype. 
---
It seems a bit ambitious though and will probably get  a cease and desist from Blizzard.
---
Which is a shame because this is what I wanna play.
---
no we cant smh. the current iteration is alrdy out and blizzard is not gnna change it now
---
But the raids aren't nerfed. What was nerfed in this version of MC? BWL?
---
Truth.
---
Toss a coin!
---
[smiles in bard]
---
Do you know when it was changed? Was that in beta or at launch?
---
Your link doesnt disagree with me, they tried to emulate old behavior.
---
Anyone why ever used slam in vanilla and uses it now knows things are very, very different.
---
Repeating yourself using the wrong terminology won't make it any more right.
---
Nost didn't just say "Lol okay lets make this harder to compensate".
---
They studied and researched to find evidence for the ealiest versions of raids, bosses, battlegrounds and items and implemented / adjusted them as they progressed through the timeline.
---
Which is something Blizzard has not done, and won't do. Blizzard just took a carbon copy of 1.12 and said fuck it, ship it.
---
How do you know they could have done that easily ? What place do YOU have to know this or pretend to know this. You're just a mad reddit commenter thinking that the private servers that did this are perfect and did it all for free means anyone can do it for a low cost, you have NO IDEA what you are talking about. You know jack shit yet keep commenting under the pretense of being an all knowing god. Pathetic.
---
I haven’t been using block on the pull. 
---
I should be though, shit, thanks for that. I still seem to have a problem with getting the graves all open in time. Do you use a click macro or something?
---
I know which one you were talking about, but it was for experienced players, if you've never ran the dungeon before it wont be accurate.
---
Bonereaver has more stamina, crit, a proc that is better than ragnaros' with over 2 times the proc chance, and it enables sword spec, which is infinitely better than mace spec for anything but fringe cases. It also drops off of the same boss and doesn't cost 6k in mats.
---

I do not think that at all. The private servers had lots of bugs.
---
lol until dodge, miss, parry, dodge, miss.....
---
The zoom on the health bar was tops.
---
It appears you listed buffs instead of needs, although the effect to make content easier is the same.
---
I know this is off topic, but how do you like warlock? I was playing a rogue and got to 40 before I took a break. I was highly considering switching to warlock because they are needed more in my guild and they seem way easier to level and farm with as well.
---
why are so many classic players clickers. i dont understand
---
You just made a post on a forum to shame people trying their best to win games in AV.
---
Because you want to play casually and them wanting to play in a different way is "wrong" and make the "not enjoy the game".
---
Both of you are doing exactly the same. one is being toxic in game you are being toxic on forums, which is worse is up to whoever reads what both of you are doing.

Hope you have a better day tomorrow.

---
Yeah. Classic wow is dead. Was good while it lasted. See everyone in 2 years when they come out with burning crusade expansion
---
I love them, my favorite class by far. Very easy to level with, and they're one of the lowest played classes for some reason despite being the best 1v1 pvp class, which brings me to the next reason I love them. I pvp a lot, and I almost never lose 1v1s, and even win some 1v2s. And since they're one of the lowest played classes, you don't have to compete with as many people for gear at 60 from what I've heard.
---
Even the C'thun nerfs aren't documented on wowpedia, so exactly what if any other changes were added to the raids is hard to say.
---
But 1.12.1 itemization (spell power, hit chance for casters etc), more efficient/better talents and the 16 slot debuff cap will all be indirect nerfs to those raids as classes only improve throughout the vanilla lifespan.
---
Throughout most of Vanilla warriors didn't even have a threat reduction modifier.
---
Why should one person be able to say what they want and another not? We need all types around here to contribute.

How to update Nvidia Geoforce GTX 970m driver? 
---
Getting message saying world of Warcraft hardware changed on login. I used to be able to play on max settings. Now the frame rate isn’t as smooth there. 
---
I tried the nvidia website. Got the geoforce experience and updated geoforce game ready driver. Idk if that’s it but it’s the only thing I could figure and it says it auto updates drivers so idk
---
Payback for pre-bg horde corpse camping. Karma works in great ways!
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
So that makes the comparison to TBC faulty. Those raids were nerfed. It wasn't just itemization and talent changes. Nobody was still running SSC in 2.4, but people were clearing MC until the end of vanilla.
---
Honestly, it’s easy enough to skin the mats and have someone else craft them with a tip and go enchanting. Especially with not getting Raid trinkets, the Smoking Heart of the Mountain is too good to pass up IMO.
---
As if anyone ever wanted Grizzly or Washed Up on the server to begin with.
---
Who cares?  They're a bunch of nobodies.  What can they say they've done that's impressive?  It's Classic Wow; nothing is impressive, this time around.  Even the bullshit they did, which should have resulted in bans.
---
No one will remember a single one of these morons.
---
Blizzard shit the bed by letting people join servers willy nilly, instead of balancing A:H ratios.  These shitty guilds really are negligible to the health of the server.  Don't flatter them; they really don't deserve any recognition, for anything.
---
Bro, you could probably benefit from a chill pill.
---
Bro you’re the best class at AoE farming. Either tip your healer for healing and your tank for taunting, or don’t whine about using your abilities to help the group.
---
Frostbolt or Cone of Cold? I think we determined it was single target. The banshees for sure do the silence, not sure about the Shadow Volley on death. 
---
The Curses weren’t an issue with 2 mages and 1 paladin. And upstairs was simple as long as you didn’t pull extra.
---
I'm having a blast and haven't played this much WoW since forever, or at least since Wrath maybe beginning of Cata after which I went super casual super quick.  Classic has brought me back to loving the game again, sucks to be you.
---
Is there an artistic or non map representation in atlas?
---
[Educate yourself](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game).
---
How about blizz creates a system based on performance? Where sucking at a BG is going to give you way less honour than being good or decent. The more people you need to get working together the harder it will be to perform as a team and thus is worth more honour. Then people would stop AFKing in BGs to soak up minimal honour gains and actually participate.

Im a hunter that do solo trib runs and looted plenty of books by now.

---
Is Demo the best spec to level with?
---
There was a hunter that rolled need on the RFK axe cuz he melees often, his words.
---
I actually loved this quest. The thing didn’t drop for hundreds of kills, literally almost an entire level, but it was quiet and peaceful there and I got into that grinding groove and just went with it. I dinged and was going to give up when it dropped next kill.
---
for sure, that website is really good for checking if any of your old ass accounts have been breached. my email that i use for everything had shown up there so many times, and even a google search of my email address had shown up on some random hacking forums, password beside it out in plain text, for spotify accounts. spotify is a real huge culprit for password breaches, theres hundreds everyday with peoples emails/pass out just plainly for anyone to see. all it takes it someone trying out your info on other services and boom theyre in.  
---
that led to me making a brand new email and starting to use a password manager to generate random shit for everything i use now.
---
Except you’re making 80g ph in dm e. Throw your tank a gold.
---
It's a good thing that you can't turtle in all BGs then, so why not give the old AV back and let those who like turtling have their fun? At most it comes at a small efficiency cost to those who use it to farm honour.
---
The banshee looking ones do an AoE shadow bolt and also do an AoE silence. The super blue ones spam frost bolt all day. The darker blueish ones have a frost shield on them and curse occasionally. Finally, purple bois patrol and are invisible.
---
Shackle undead helps a lot. Freezing trap helps a lot. As a resto shaman main i drop frost protection totem to help mitigate some damage. The ghost hallways of DM W are the hardest thing in any classic 5 man, period. I might be biased but i see them as a gear check on the healer because no amount of tanking can stop those AoEs. 
---
My recommendation is to mark targets well and be ready to wipe anyway if the banshees decide to AoE a lot. Good luck

I dont know about NA but in EU my experience has been more like 20% and 80%. It felt like it increased to 40% and 60% because of the increase in premades but then some premades are utter carbage so it didnt matter.
---
Every single turtle of any kind seems to always be a victory for Horde. And usually we end up half-turtling which means we have strong defense and offense that still manages to do it... only in rare occasions both offenses get wiped but regardless we end up winning.  
---
The meme: Alliance only wins with premades has been true in my experience.
---
This is just my experience in EU. If some other horde has a different one feel free to tell... i do see in almost every match someone whining and bitching.... yet we win anyway so they just made themselves look like an absolute fool.  
---
"our offense is carbage" - 5 minutes later we win. True story.

---
I’m not saying to get rid of grinds or rewards. 
---
What I’m saying is that people are going to do things that they don’t want to do in an MMO so that they can do things that they do want to do. 
---
Like, do you think that people enjoy farming gold? No. Almost no one  inherently enjoys just chain-killing mobs or chain farming dungeons or running around the map for herbs. 
---
If those activities didn’t reward you with gold, no one would do them (or at least, 99.9% of people wouldn’t do them). 
---
But if you want your epic mount and good boe gear and consumables for raid, you have to go farm gold and do the boring stuff. If you want to respec and play cool new PvP specs, you have to farm gold. 
---
That’s a part of the game that most people don’t enjoy in and of itself. They only farm for the rewards, because the reward (gold) lets them enjoy other aspects of the game. 
---
Someone sitting in AV to get amazing gear is really just another grind like that, and saying ‘well if you don’t enjoy AV then just don’t do it’ is like saying ‘well if you don’t enjoy farming gold then just don’t do it.’

Where are all the GM shenanigans we had in vanilla?
---
Frostbolt spam 24/7. IIRC it's the blue-ish one, and I'd try to have the priest shackle it if we had one in the group. It might also do Frost Nova, but it usually spams 35 or 40 yard frostbolts unless you LoS it.

---
This is completely wrong, manapool above a certain treshold is only relevant when AoE farming and doing PVP. 
---
By lvl 30 you can easily increase your frostbolt damage output by 30% just through some cheap frost damage items, while still having more than enough mana to kill a few mobs in a row.
---
Mace spec isn't better for pvp. People are using Rag because they haven't gotten BRE. The casters have commented on this since the tauren guy had his first duel weeks ago. The idea is that sword spec will not only give you the auto attack that you were going to get while your target was stunned anyway, but also get the bonus rage as well as the instant burst damage. To be suddenly bursted like that make people panic, which is incredibly good in pvp. Yes, there will obviously be cases where the stun is better, but for the majority of scenarios, the burst is heaps better.
---
The BRE proc is a self-buff, not a debuff on the target, and it procs off of practically anything at over 10% chance. Rag is a 300 damage proc with less than 5% proc chance.
---
But you're right in that HoR obviously isn't a trash weapon. It's just not as good as BRE, and since they drop from the same boss, and the worse of the two even takes as ton of mats to make, it's a no-brainer.
---
When I farm gold, I don't do it for the gold. It's part of the process to get what ever I'm working towards. It's part of the process for getting my epic mount, or what ever I'm grinding for at the moment. It actually makes me appreciate getting that reward I've worked for ever more because I feel like I've actually earned it. When they started giving mounts and other rewards away in retail for cheap I stopped caring about them because I no longer felt like I earned them. Feeling like I've earned my rewards is part of classic's appeal.
---
piqued*
---
I'm not sure about authenticity, but Nostalrius and Northdale were definitely more *fun*.
---
the only thing is, it would be cake walk to anyone who raided past LFR in retail of any sort I think.
---
I mean, the mechanics may be new to them since they won't have played it, but after one or two fatboss or whoever will put out videos it would be easy, if not just read up on it tbh.
---
i really don't know how many players play classic who will raid and continue raiding into the later tiers who are not already a wow player. at least my raid team is filled with people who at least raided before in some capacity.
---
Such a poor phishing attempting lol

exactly this

Go to advanced options on the display settings menu and select your nvidia graphics card.

I feel the same Fattens, but you never know this might be the "late adopters" and early majority is next big influx of new players.
---
I vaguely recognize the reference but I'm not sure from where, but very nice.
---
To those who don't like this, as a mage main let me say this. I don't expect a tip in any instance or during group content. But when you ask for water and I'm on the other side of the zone and I have to spend 5 minutes running to you, I expect a tip. I feel like I get tipped less by people who make me run across the zone to them...
---
you sure can.
---
Let the members arrange weekly pugs, that clear 11/11 and being tryouts, new members, alts, puggers, this way People will be drawn to you, and you need to execute good if you want good players.
---
and solo kill skul, just takes some time. less time than running the whole dungeon tho
---
EU players make up such a small percentage of the classic community that they don't get as much support as us in NA. I heard they only have 2 GM's handling all of EU. When they only have to handle 10% of the player base, its probably the most cost effective
---
I'm not sure why you refer to it as rose tinted glasses, as if people are misremembering what their experience on private servers was like. Northdale was literally 6 months ago. Also, you can't exactly "go play a (vanilla) private server" any more since their populations all died with the Classic release.
---
It is known.

As an additional note, I used this trick to (somewhat) fish for Stonespine.
---
Use the gnomish cloaking device to slip past the first pack in Strat UD, move up as far as possible and use the spyglass towards his patrol route.  You need to constantly spam your target macro and give it a few minutes.  To reset you can try to run out or just die.  
---
Because of the 1 hour CD on gnomish cloaking device, this trick is only good for one extra shot at getting Stonespine, but it essentially doubles your chance every time you go to run UD strat.

So many "oh shit" buttons, I love playing pally.

spelldamage is pretty shit in low amounts at low level.
---
It's almost always better to just have int instead of spellpower until higher level when you can stack more spellpower.
---
“I'm just calling people stupid for generalizing all horde to be a certain way, then trying to get even by emulating that same toxic behavior.”
---
People generalized what horde did to them -in the game. Because math.
---
The “trying to get even” is a handful of comments calling them shit heads-for being shit heads. 
---
Your argument read as if you think the name calling by a few alliance on a subreddit is the same as the in-game behavior. 
---
Not. Even. Close.
---
Yeah, I always hear that argument and as someone who heavily advocates for a Classic+, I understand fully. Blizzard has not done Classic as well as they really should have, particularly in terms of servers. (Faction balance being the exception rather than the norm is unacceptable...but it's not like TBC is going to do better than Classic+ could when it comes to this. It is what it is.)
---
The reason we advocate for Classic+ is because we would rather see Blizzard try Classic+ at all, even if it crashes and burns, than simply have them rerelease TBC. That expansion had a ton of factors which I admit aren't necessarily bad at all, but are much more Retail-like than Classic-like imo. I'd even dare say that TBC is closer to BFA than it is to Classic, and if I wanted to play TBC, then I would have and always still could play on a private server.
---
And yet, here you are, browsing in a subreddit about wow and trying to put others down who enjoy the game.
---
I thought this was how everyone fished for jed?
---
I know atleast a dozen ppl who switched from alliance to horde because we were tired of getting flightpoint camped at level 30+.  
---
Im pretty sure Im not the only one with his circle of friends who did that
---
Back in day when i played on wrath pservrer, I had 19 twink hunter, when i got bored, I would go to org gates and do this so so many times. Just waiting there dead till see someone flagged lose duel, revive and kill him. Ofc Instantly die after in most cases. but boy it was fun. esp between bg q.

You want the slowest 2hander you can find. You're weapon speed has nothing to do with flurry uptime.

---
Cough paladin tier bonuses cough
---
What makes alliance awful is the attitude. If the first push doesn’t work everyone just starts arguing and complaining. My sense is that horde actually plays to win, regardless if it’s 10 mins or 40 mins. Alliance automatically assumes it’s better to lose quickly when the first push doesn’t work.
---
Blizzard wont ban him because he brings money.
---
tehnically correct -&gt; the best  correct.
---
Did this after dinging lvl 70 in BC. Had farmed a few honor epics too. Best 3 bgs ever
---
Lights Hope for example had way more players online at peak time than the average WoW server. It saw roughly 13-14k at peak hours. It still performed better than Blizzard's layered laggy bag of white servers. Had a lot of fun in large scale pvp there. Not so much here.
---
We allow pvp specs for Mc, since it’s so easy. Fury does more damage in raid, especially if you play alliance. Did top dps as an arms 2 weeks ago. So easy :)
---
I have hundred of level 1 characters on every AH of every servers and none of them are automated. This is how I have fun with wow, playing the AH.
---
If then loops are not ai.
---
Every single class has a rotation of 1-2 buttons.
---
I had a similar camera glitch where it would lock into one direction.  For example it would always return to north west no matter which way I'd move. Clicking another player to Follow was the only way to fix it.
---
yeah and I use my feet to kick a ball at a giant wall keyboard which is how I play hands free
---
I was 55 in wintersping at the start of p2. Got camped since then. Decided to play the economy instead with lvl 1's.
---
But I'm not doing something I don't like, I'm working towards something I want. Now if I start hating the process I'd stop within minutes and move on to something else. Either an alt or another game. if this game does nothing but bore me with grind then I'm likely to unsub as I've done many times in the past.
---
As much as I dislike this whiny post that's not a very good example as Nostalrius was literally shut down at one point
---
Just shy of 8 days playtime. I was not the most efficient leveler. Had to relearn a lot.
---
It's actually even more than that. If you read stuff about Uldaman and the archaeological quests, Dwarves basically literally came from the stone. Which makes sense with Stoneform and all that.
---
gnome warrior with 2h is hilarious, but i rolled human for pve reasons and is doing one on the side for funzies.
---
Min maxing wow classic or being competitive in this game is like showing up with a formula one in a 1955 grand Prix.
---
Everything has been done 15 years ago lol.
---
Good advice, thank you.
---
Vael will break 90% of the so called raiding guilds because you need hunts who know their class.
---
i'm not sure what changed between then and now but the last time i hardcore grinded AV before this (end of TBC) the boss and adds were all linked and none of them could be kited out of the keep
---
didn't matter with end of expansion level raid gear as you could just rush drek, tank all the warmasters, pop hero and delete him through the 25% hp buffs
---
but pulling the warmasters out one by one to kill them individually seems stupid and easily fixed
---
Therezanes for pvp/aoe/dungeons
---
Ice lord for raiding(currently)
---
Fire offhand for future raiding(possibly, since staffs get better as do late raid off hands)
---
And here I am, just happy I finaly got a official vanilla server after 14 years :)
---
I can list the features that I think make TBC cross that line to better explain my viewpoint if you'd like, but I don't really want to be condescending and "you're not allowed to like this" so I can just leave it here.
---
What is the most popular battleground discord?
---
IIRC, he starts at 40%, so not that as close, but still pretty close to Execute range.
---
&gt; but I'm not sure what to do about that yet.
---
Can also use it to farm gold for a new main. Warlock has similarish gameplay with caster benefits and utility with summons and stuff. They're also still decent without a pet which I feel is less true of hunter (outside of like raids where pets aren't much use). Rogue has similar agility itemization for good gear. Given how rigid hunter is in terms of its strengths, druid for flexibility is a change of pace for sure.
---
"Your whining is super-effective."
---
It works surprisingly often...though not often enough, alas.
---
Pug = Pick Up Group. 
---
People you randomly group with for raids or dungeons.  Impressing them is a way to get recruits for your guild. 
---
Also see if your server has a Discord and advertise there.
---
It's basically another MC as far as difficulty goes. No challenge at all until the last two bosses. Vael had a reputation back in the day but he's not hard with the talents and abilities we have available to us now.
---
Visually, BWL is a lot more appealing than MC. And there are more mechanics to keep you engaged (suppression room, etc)
---
Best meme I’ve seen since launch hands down
---
Buffing aint an issue with 15min buffs, very cheap on mana cost too. Just download pally power for raids. :P
---
If the AI is good enough to pass a turring test, then Blizzard stands to gain a lot from it. By simulating players to alleviate population issues in certain level ranges. There's also the case for adding such an AI to a raid and letting it evolve to counter the meta strategies run against it. Would make for an interesting dynamic raid scene.
---
I agree with your sentiment that this is an issue that needs addressing, however I feel like Zelden isn't in a position to give us answers and we're derailing a useful thread, as such lets move it across to another thread?
---
I used drain tanking while level. A lotta guides online on how
---
For open world, i think herb is better.  But as a warlock doing solo (or with healer) jump runs in DME getting the 2-3 rich thorium veins at the end makes mining better IMO.
---
No. For an example, if a rogue cheap shots you, spam blind and if he fucks up his next move and gives you that .1-.5 seconds or whatever, you’ll get the blind even if he’s behind you. Then you can reset if you don’t have dots on you or do what you gotta do to handle business :)
---
It can be resisted, it can miss, and it can be poison cleansed.
---
Of course, but Chinese gold farmers probably support and are endorsed by the Chinese government anyways.
---
Horde side btw
---
Some people will have a hard time,  it's not as forgiving,  most people should roll through it
---
Only marginally so. In 3 months, fewer people will be getting their 15 weekly HKs. Regardless, you would get half the honor per hour in WSG, which will still make some ranks completely unachievable.
---
I want to pug suppression room just for the lulz
---
no joke, recently leveled a hord char jesus christ its insane how much easier it is, every quest is just ''go kill appropiate level mobs at x''
---
Deathrolling is gay
---
Doesn't make a living wage?  Mages shit gold bars...
---
Its also the best version of AV.
---
The reasons for this could be, that their healers or tanks missed the queue.
---
I would say, make sure your guild has laser focus
---
it could be just being a lvling guild, where you auto invite all the unguilded people (I hate that but hey, you do you)
---
it can be a end game raiding guild that only takes in min maxers (a bit late but hey), or a casual one, or just one looking to do dungeons for funzies.
---
an RP guild that everyone has to RP in guild chat and have meta stuff in discord.
---
a PvP guild that does WSG premades or sync AV drops (well for horde less so) or do roaming world pvp
---
laser focus what you want the guild to do, so you will find the same minded people.
---
any hunter that would go with 1 agi over 7 stam is braindead
---
World pvp shouldnt be rewarded.
---
One of my guildies is a warlock running people through deadmines and SM. And i think its as fast as a prot pally (me).
---
Hopefully your not rolling for loot.
---
AV was at its peak when it wasn't about reward which has all but ruined modern WoW including classic. People only play for rewards in places that give big rewards, but if it was reverted to its more fun turtling version the people just playing for fun would show up and have a good time.
---
What's great about AV is it funnels everyone into a semibalanced 40v40 fight that can last for hours simulating world pvp without the population imbalance. I don't know how Blizzard fails to see this.
---
i would blame anonymity &amp; to a lesser extent convenience on Blizzard's decisions with Classic. crossrealm battlegrounds were added in the very last patch of vanilla so they aren't representative of what battlegrounds in vanilla were like for the majority of the time, same idea can be applied with battlemasters but they were added much earlier in patch 1.6 so they were a part of vanilla for a significant amount of time. 
---
i do agree with the rest of the points though, especially how awful the honor system is.
---
How would a bot owner report you? Isn't the point of botting that you're going afk while it plays?
---
For Deadmines and stockades, you NEED the group to be full of low levels so the group average drops and so then the XP gained is better.  You should be able to find guildies or other people doing it and needing to fill space in the dungeon boost groups for free.
---
On private servers we easily killed dragonkin on that fight withiutbwo of buffs.
---
How much of Blizzard's cock do you gobble a day lmao
---
This was me all night haha. I need my honor. /spit /spit /spit /flex
---
0.25 Blizzard bucks have been desposited in your account
---
In your first raid? I highly doubt that. Sure ince you have a lot of bwl or aq gear. Maybe a top 10% guild could do its but the average guild no way.
---
Again a bot a scripted to follow a specific set of instructions. Where as an AI is trained, as in humains let it take what ever actions it wants and then rates them and repeats the process. The AI is encouraged to take actions that lead to better chances of success, but decides on it's own what those will be within the confines of the game. Early such matches are clusterfucks situations as the AI just tries random things but as it does so billions of times it learns which of those actions are more useful than others so it tends to favour them more. That StarCraft AI for example kept making more than the maximum amount of workers for resources for an unknown reason. Could it be on to something or is it just a random fluke that hadn't been eliminated?
---
There's no way you aren't an autistic fucking nigger working at Blizzard based on your post history. I hope your family and you get lynched!
---
How do you pull more than 5-8 mobs there at once? I always get wrecked by melee leeway
---
There is a very stronk cross realm grp - but you need an invite for the discord, and then there is a vetting process - as someone mentioned below they want to see your gear etc
---
Essentially what happens is you are all on disc, raid leader will count down que - he will then announce the bg you need to get into - sometimes you won't make the queue for a game and will need to sit out and wait til next.
---
Look at the 5 set bonus though, it's hot garbage.
---
I prefer /Tar Gor, which targets that one boss no one ever does Gorulak Anvilcrack(or something like that).
---
Flash of light max rank on 1
---
Holy light max rank on 2
---
Flash of light min rank on 3
---
I use default raid frames, with MISSING health number shown over the bar. Dungeons: max width, inr aids min width.
---
  For reference, i have 600+ healing, 4400 mana unbuffed.
---
As a fight starts, i start chain casting max rank flash of light.  If I start "losing" aka the tank is taking more damage than i'm healing, i'll wait till he's down like 1500HP, then cast holy fervor and then cast max rank holy light.  Generally the cast finishes at about 2500HP missing, putting tank back to full.  Then depending on pull size, max rank holy light again, or max rank flash of light.
---
For raid healing/heals between pulls.
---
 If someone is missing more than 600hp i use max rank flash of light.
---
If theyre missing 200hp i use min rank flash of light.
---
For raids, get healComm, and have other healers get it too.  Shows incoming heals to targets.  I use all healthbars green, and then blue as incoming health color.
---
Why rank 4 and not rank 1?
---
No, they don't. A friend moved to the US from the UK and had to make a new account. They refused to move his characters.
---
Every class and race combination? Redoing the same shit with a different skin isn't content lol wtf...
---
Can anyone confirm that this would work with the engineering helm?  I know it has a cool down but once is better than nonce.
---
Be good and they will come.
---
Try being a fury warrior, we have like 4 upgrades from pre-raid BiS in game at the moment.
---
And yes! Pally power classic too!
---
Yeah there was a similar line on Northdale in one of the centaur caves in Desolace.
---
That comment has replies and upvotes, it's contributing to the conversation, you just disagree with it and want them silenced.
---
World PvP was always trash and blizzard was always in a state of trying to incentivize / promote it but failing. It’s why they added halaa in tbc and many other failed experiments during wows life time. There of course was very rare occasions where fun raid type things would happen but that was the exception not the rule. Not sure why people fantasized vanillas world PvP. It was always about griefing.
---
I do them on my hunter. Kill zevim, the water elemental boss. For the final  boss I use nature protection pots to be safe, when he’s at 50% I FD and then run into the cave to mine the RTV.  
---
I do DM tribute runs as well and average about 16ish mins per run. I can attest DME farm on hunter is easier than tribute.
---
Then dont play.
---
Hell yeah takes a few min to get there and when I wanna do bgs I just hearth
---
Yeah only takes a few min to get there then just hearth to sw
---
Ooof I’ve seen someone do that, that’s actually what inspired me
---
Love this. This is what made wow the iconic mmo that it is. Retail is just the poor sequels leeching off the brand. If they really want to recapture what wow was 15 years ago they need to invest in some fresh writers (or the original writers) and classic+. It won't be as fiscally efficient however, so it's really just a dream. 
---
A man child can dream... A man child can dream.
---
Similarly, I very much judge a race based on its casting animations. That is why my main is a Female Night Elf Druid.
---
I do what I can
---
What do you farm? Those 2 bosses? Do you need to kite and shit?
---
I love drain tanking as well. It is so much fun. The Warlock quests are a lot of fun as well.
---
Only need 6.5k hahaha. I got fucking 7 epics and bene. Got like 5.2
---
It was one of the best places for herb farming, also had a lot of Cobalt and adamantite deposits that would spawn. There was a place by the titan lady where mobs would endlessly spawn, you'd see a pile of death knights standing there 24/7 farming mobs as they ran out, they would get death gripped and killed, then looted.
---
They eventually nerfed the spawn rate. It was crazy. You could have 40 people farming them constantly and you still couldn't kill them fast enough. They dropped raw gold, as well as items.
---
It's not a 1 for 1 remake of the game.  So asking for different parts of the original game makes a lot of sense.
---
Launching with just MC but on patch 1.12 balance is already a massive difference from the fresh launch of Vanilla.  Asking them to go with the better version of AV instead of just sticking with the 1.12 version for no real reason is definitely not moronic.
---
But hey keep slinging insults I'm sure that helps your asinine argument.
---
Hey I use Arcane Power + Presence of + TOEP macro too!
---
The only thing that would fix that is an ELO like rating system. Where better players would be favoured to play against better players and bad players would be favoured to play against bad players. It's a common thing to do in PvP games like mobas, that is to try and balance out the matches so that players of equivalent skill (and in a game like wow, gear) play each other.  
---
Otherwise you're just randomly picking from the pool and unless you're near the top it's just going to be a luck of the draw experience.
---
I never had as little fun in vanilla wow as I have on classic. It's just shit tier counterfit compared to these pservers. It's first time that im demoralized from going for r13-14 just because how blizzard handled pvp systems (late honor, stupid bg version/bg split into phases). These servers were way better than thing that blizzard served us with classic. It's just a money grab before shadowlands with content pushed as fast as possible so average wow player will go to next exp and leave classic. Simple. 
---
**NEW FRESH WHEN**
---
The people bitching about 15 min games are doing av for the rep not the honor. Going to wsg isn't an option for them.
---
Except back in the day people were queuing over and over again for WSG to Rank 14.  Av being less efficient would pile the "pvp elite" into WSG instead.  Not the world.
---
I remember I did like 5 brd runs and didn't get a single item as my druid healer. Started bitching about it and next drop I got my very first blue 
---
Bitching is legitimate strategy ;)
---
They would turn way more people away from the game if they buffed the raids so only a few guilds on every server were clearing.
---
I agree there is no reason to censor old private server projects.
---
Atleast with 10man wsg premades they have to have enough skill to win 95+% of their 10v10s if they want to rank successfully.  But they also have to no life it because the Vanilla pvp system is about who play AND win the most.
---
I sure was running ssc in 2.4, even karazhan.
---
Not saying everyone liked it but "Nobody liked it back in the days either" is completely false.
---
Horde cant premade av.
---
Yes, we had Nefarian on farm and were working on AQ40 when we approached this idea that maybe it would be possible to kill Ragnaros before submerge if we didn't all run away and setup traps 30 seconds before it was due. We ended up canning the idea.
---
&gt;Except you have to also life tap, mana pot, dark rune, and keep both curses up, ending with a well timed shadowburn 
---
The fuck are you talking about. Warlocks can only use 1 curse so they can't "keep up both curses", they also last 5 minutes except for Recklessness which lasts 2 minutes and is the 3rd curse you want up at all times, and since no fights in mc last over 2 mins you never need to reapply curses. You also don't NEED to use dark runes you can but there totally overkill. Lastly if your DS/ruin you don't have range limitations you start the fight with your curse back up and shadowbolt spam with life taps thrown in. It's very much like a mage...
---
How should he los the cast? Dont we have to go into the tunnel?
---
I don’t even understand the context for your first comment. Do you really believe class design, raiding and the PvP system are not archaic or was it just an elaborate way of shittalking retail?
---
Your comment literally added nothing to the discussion, and your surprised I think your a moron?
---
DONT INSULT BOBBY BOUCHER, JR. BY CALLING HIM HORDE FILTH. 
---
(This is a joke, also great meme)
---
Which is kind of crazy because with so many people pursuing good ranks you'd think some would throw in the towel and just enjoy pvp instead.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;  No challenge at all until the last two bosses.
---
I remember the first two being the only ones worth talking about.
---
Lol yeah lets wait a year in total. Also like that will change anything, oh wow fireball instead of frostbolt and then after that its back to one button spam. Mage is just an extremely boring and overrepresented class, i can barely even log on my mage anymore.
---
In MC 90% of healing spells used by priests are flash light. Raid healing is not even remotely close to dungeon healing unfortunately
---
It seems to me that the mods don't even know how to enforce the rule. It's worded in a very specific way, but the way they moderate it seems very broad.
---
----
---
***Rule 4:***
---
*Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour.*
---
**Removing some words to clarify where I'm going with this:**
---
 
---
*Do not share or encourage the use of private servers*
---
So the rule is, in regards to private servers, to not share or encourage its use. Does mentioning private servers, especially by their name, somehow considered sharing the use of private servers, or is it considered encouraging the use of them, even if it's just referencing them in a proper context? 
---
I personally don't think so, and I agree with OP, it's an outdated rule now that most of the decent private servers have shut down anyway. I also find it sort of creepy that you can't mention private servers, it feels pretty dystopian to be watching your words that carefully in a gaming subreddit.
---
It’s generalizing ofc but you get my point. 99% people don’t wanna be stuck in the same bg for 5 hours
---
&gt; That wasn't bliz, that one is on us.
---
A new grammar school opens and takes enrollment through the summer, with new students arriving to the new campus in late August. The students arrive to see there are only 3 Male students and about 450 Female students. The administration leaves it up to the students to fix the problem they created, no Boys Extracurriculars are allowed until more Male students enroll in the school.
---
Students' fault?
---
BWL isn't honestly much harder you just can't carry as many lazy/bad players through the raid. The fights require you to pay attention and know what's going on, you can't watch TV and raid BWL like you can with MC.
---
I never said it wasn't archaic.  I said the game isn't a 1 for 1 remake of the original so asking for a different implementation then the one we got makes a lot of sense.
---
Did you think I was the other commenter?
---
Hahahaha!
---
Awesome!!! I'll hop on tonight!
---
That is a warlock.
---
Layering was the best thing to happen to classic.
---
I mean, kill em once, sure, just don't camp them.
---
Yup, our first BWL. We also didn't think we could do it that way, so we tried the kite strategy first and failed miserably like 6 times, so we thought we'd give the other strategy a shot and it worked the first time. Just gotta set up the groups properly with windfury totems, battle shout, true shot auras and all that jazz.
---
Warriors have a legit rotation and some cool stuff like Heroic Strike Queuing or slam batching to make it more complex.
---
because playing wow 20 hours a day isnt fun no matter what cope you try to bring up
---
Well the issue with guild run is they expect you to be there every time. I love the flexibility of a pug.
---
Hey guys, if you're wondering what a young bootlicker looks like, here ya go.
---
Future Fascist
---
No it wouldn't. Every mons he hits gives them a chance to proc the effect, if it was chance on cast then it would only have 1 chance to proc per cast even if it hit 15 mobs. Would you rather have 1 chance to gain 100 Mana per cast or 15 chances?
---
What are you talking about a full set of teir gear
---
If you are a bear, you want molten helm and molten belt.
---
I do not think guides explain this enough. Threat is not a simple topic to begin with and repeated dps=threat I think leads to assumptions. Stance dancing is logical but majority is still def stance.
---
FRESH
---
I know enslave only lasts for a Max of 5 mins but the real question is can you only have 2 enslaved through this bug or could you gather yourself a tiny demon army for a few minutes.
---
Not really.  You're more useful in a handful of raid fights.  Humans are better in every other one.
---
&gt; You cannot compare an illegal FTP private server with something that is a paid service. It is just not proper logic, pepega logic.
---
You're coming across as rude and stupid, just an FYI
---
Yeah northdale would have been the smart choice. 14k people online at launch with no lag.
---
because alliance just tries to zerg win and just afk's out if it doesn't work.
---
how about you play the fucking game
---
Not sure if you got autocorrected or not but it's spell batching not bashing just in case you didn't know.
---
You'll never reach crit cap.
---
uhm no.. it's because horde just let alliance zerg win until the pve'ers hit exalted and stopped queueing
---
Probably a mage. And it never crossed their mind to make every warrior's life hell, either.
---
Is that relevant for t2?
---
It is correct it can proc on any offensive spell that lands.
---
He's not too bright and is attracted to authority.
---
He's going to have a long, angry life.
---
Daybreak, an alliance guild on Herod is recruiting for our second raid team if interested. Times are thurs and fri 10am - 1pm est
---
I'm a 60 combat rogue. I've done about 50 Rend runs to farm his swords. Finally saw the main hand today and a fucking Hunter rolled need on it and won. I called him every name in the book, and frankly he deserved it. You have to be a seriously stupid mother fucker to roll on Dal'rends as a hunter when you can literally do one AV and get Ice Barbed Spear. 
---
But outside of truly egregious shit like that, I tend not to care much.

lol pservers suck
---
Wouldn't hunter's humanoid/beast(druid) tracking become OP in WSG with this information.
---
Looking for the flag carrier? Spyglass + tracking sounds insane.
---
Only on offensive spells so unless you can somehow figure out a way to use an offensive spell on a friendly target (it's classic might be possible) it can't proc on friendlies.
---
this is incorrect. horde has a higher pvp population, and alliance pve players stop queuing up when they hit exalted.. that is why there is a queue imbalance
---
C'mon Roach.
---
From what I've read it can proc on any "offensive spell" definitely doesn't have to do any damage as I know for a fact warlock curses like curse of Shadow can proc it.
---
yeah cuz they are sweaty neckbeard addicts lol
---
I use Parallels to run Windows 7 in a VM for job requirements. It totally jams up a MB Air with 8MB RAM (without firing up WoW at all, just Office. While this Air is capable of running WoW on the Mac side on potato graphics quality settings, I have never tried running it through Windows.) I think 16MB RAM would be safer.
---
Hooray! Mods that actually do mod stuff!
---
I would say, its a good idea to have atleast 1-2 feral tanks though for BWL
---
that's an aggressive take
---
I tried originally. I was outnumbered by friends who have all since quit playing
---
Well there you go. Undead rogues are the supreme dicks.
---
I like when people that are obviously botting try to convince others that weren't even suspecting them that they aren't botting.
---
Warrior and Shaman is the strongest duo for jump runs. Fire totems, thornlings, dynamite, crystal charges, etc.

Wow 76
---
There is lots of corners in the tunnel, the entrance to the tunnel, and the pillars. You don't *need* to go into the tunnel, its just generally more convenient.
---
I don't understand how that logic is hard to follow. What nodes are there in capital cities or at flight paths? The nodes and gold farms are out in the zones. Like, you and opposing faction player see a black lotus or rich thorium vein spawn and you duel over it.
---
wow 76
---
Except if your not a hunter
---
I’ve been looking for myself also. Currently checking past kill times on wcl and then watching details fight timer.
---
Let me provide the actual alliance perspective. Most games are either premades or premades waiting out queues without punishment leading to games starting 15 v 40. Most of these result in turtles due to late joiners, which is bad for everybody but inevitably results in a horde win. For us, each AV has about the same odds of being a 10 min win as being a 30 min loss. The clear solution is to learn from every competitive multiplayer game made since 2004 and punish players with deserter type debuffs for declining queues.
---
You can get an AV mount for 640g, and rank 3 in the process
---
Arcane explosion to extend pull range as you run through if body pull radius isn't large enough. Other than that tip, assuming you don't already use it, get more stam and int if possible
---

Grats

&gt;It's not so much the fact that we're on 1.12.1, it's the fact that it's a 15 YEAR OLD game that everyone knows everything about and we're in computers that aren't running the game at 5 FPS like back in the day
---
I'm sorry but if you really believe this uour crazy. The player base is better no question but the reason every raid is a joke is because of the insane strength of items and talents that is 1.12.1
---
I have a MacBook 2011 and used it for WoW just fine under Bootcamp / Win 8.1
---
(GPU broke again so doesn’t work anymore)
---
Majove is NOT supported as it needs minimum a 2012 MB. 
---
Just use bootcamp with an inactivated 8.1   You don’t have to invest any money and only for WoW you don’t need to activate 
---
https://superuser.com/questions/498714/is-windows-8-pro-usable-without-activation

Good luck and have fun
---
Maybe they’ll accept summons :o
---
Pvp happens across all levels.
---
Nope they are still green to them 39 is max
---
I do Tinkerer+ Rotgrip+Princess + Herbs
---
Bingo.
---
Yes making players massively stronger is in effect a nerf to all raids...
---
There's something strange with kiting/pulling mobs for sure. I had a regular bear in Hillsbrad aggro my warlock, and I just let my voidwalker auto it once and keep running. Well long story short I could kite the bear across the entire zone just by using my pet auto attack once in a while.
---
When I finally chose to stop kiting, it teleported away. It didn't run back to it's regular path, it disappeared completely.
---
I mean, did you buy him 6 slotters?
---
FRE
---
Blizzard chose a patch and decided that would be what it is, no questions asked. It is a good strategy.
---
Lets say they decide to change AV to an earlier version. What next? Buff the raids so they aren't so goddamn easy? Change the honor system to not be so shit? 
---
By stating a version they are basing everything off of, it leaves no room to be biased. Their only other course of action would to have the game come out on an early patch, like the Mauradon patch or something, and have us go through the same buff/nerfs through major patches throughout a server's life. But this is pretty hard to do.
---
No this just makes it faster
---
Meanwhile I have basically instant queues in all level ranges on ally side :&gt;
---
It's amazing that people like you still have faith in this shit company, lol.
---
Fuck those huntards
---
I just did it in PvP gear
---
I agree. Most of the vanilla private servers simply don't exist anymore. There is nothing wrong with talking about the differences between them. How can I encourage the use of something that isn't around anymore?
---
There's only roughly 300,000 players playing Classic.  If 1 in 1000 are bots, that's only 300 accounts.
---
The price is definitely right!
---
Main issue with that is back in the day, I am pretty sure people just picked what race/faction they felt like playing. They wanted to play an Elf or a Dwarf or a Gnome so they went Alliance. Maybe they mained humans or Night Elf in WC3.
---
Gamers seem to optimize everything now down to the choice that yes has tiny advantages and disadvantages but is ultimately cosmetic for most players. It is just a problem with gaming in the 2010's for the most part.
---
Ah! I run it fine on a 2013 MacBook Air, but that doesn’t help you...
---
&gt; raids were harder 
---
It was stated early on that pservers probably had inflated armor values.
---
Blizzard has the source. They can't be wrong. 
---
&gt; vanilla feels better without it
---
Please enlighten us on how you disabled it on Classic to test. We would love to compare for ourselves.
---
I partially agree, Blizzard doesn't give a damn about how many people bitch on reddit about one thing or the other. What they do care about however is sub numbers. If a bunch of camped to death Ally unsubscribed, it's likely they noticed and took action.
---
Dire Maul might have been the same IMO: a reaction to a bunch of early 60 unsubscribing.
---
Handily

Last night we had an Alliance rogue ganking in Booty Bay.  Keep pretending only Horde are shitters though

You definitely need to wear plate/mail, and it can be damage oriented.
---
Warlocks outfarm the shit out of mages in my experience playing both. DM east solo runs are better GPM then anything a mage can do.
---
Blizz isn't investing one fucking dime of our sub money into supporting this game.
---
I don't think the advantages are that tiny, especially in PvP. I only played Horde (Orc Shaman and Undead Priest in Vanilla, Orc Hunter in Classic) and I've constantly felt the racials were a pretty important parf of my PvP toolkit.
---
its pretty ugly
---
&gt;Why would people recommend lock to solo dm east when he wanted something less tedious.
---
Because he asked if a lock can compare to a mage in farm speed and DM east solo runs are a locks best farm so of course we're going to suggest that... Also dm tribute is not easier then dm east DM east is a joke and can be done naked as a lock.
---
What a loser.
---
2h Fury is pretty fun because it has a priority-based rotation with some depth.
---
1. If the time until the next swing less than or equal to your Slam cast time, Slam.
---
2. If you have 45 or more rage, Bloodthirst. If Bloodthirst is on cooldown, Whirlwind.
---
4. If Overpower is available and switching stances won’t drop 25 or more rage, switch to Battle and Overpower, then switch back to Berserker.
---
5. If the target at less than 20% health and your rage is close to the cost of your Execute, use Execute.
---
And then there’s general stuff to consider like prioritizing Whirlwind instead of Bloodthirst when there are two or more targets
---
Have fun with undead rogues hihihi
---
I'll kiss your ass if there even is a "ban wave".
---
Couldn’t blizzard just change the whisper colour of official GM whispers?
---
Why would you still be farming Mara at 60 as a lock when dm east is like 3-4 times better gold?
---
The irony is people have tried this one since day 1 on alliance and I've literally never seen someone fall for it.
---
...says the person posting in a wow forum. Piss off, hypocrite.
---
UBRS buff was huge help the first 2 weeks we downed Rag.
---
Warrior leveling is definitely the "hardest" but leveling in general isn't really difficult.   Warrior just doesn't get any of its good buttons until pretty far into the leveling process and all of its cooldowns are super long compared to other classes.
---
Locks are much better you can do the first 3 bosses literally naked, only remotely difficult part is last boss and even then it's not hard once you get a feel for it. I regularly farm the first 3 bosses in DM east in my bloodsail pirate costume.
---
These servers cost almost nothing to keep up.   They're not gaining anything by banning a few people before their sub renews.
---
this whole subreddit is so fucking scared of blizzard and anything "illegal"
---
It's because it is blizzard support. Why should blizz ban a blizz account? /s
---
How many times has some variation of this same thing been posted?
---
This post is half a day old now, and you're still a turd.  Time won't change that.
---
Just wanted to reiterate that and remind you.

Geralt killed plenty of elfs and human so i wouldn't put him as alliance . Neutral as it will
---
&gt; in an entire year, you would manage to find and ban 8000 accounts
---
There's only like 300,000 people playing classic!   If 1 in a 1000 are bots, that's only 300 accounts.
---
I average 100g an hour with tailoring/enchanting as well. De those greens into greater eternals and turn the felcloth into felcloth gloves.
---
People who are stuck in vanilla. No 2factor. Goes to shady websites to get add ons. No researching before looking for add ons. Believes such whispers from "blizzard"
---
The Ram from AV is Bind on Pickup so you can't have someone else give it to you.   
---
I don't know about ram riding but I don't think you need it.
---
I'm a lock soloing DM east solo is both easy and relaxing...
---
They have their own chat window, they're blue, and there's a GM logo next to their name. You'd have to be stupid AF to fall for these scam whispers these days.
---
It's not a single person and it's not new. This kind of scammer has been around for at least a decade. Your post might as well be spam.
---
Yea social engineering is hacking. But this isn't even that.
---
details fight timer is not working for me, it doesn't show a timer or a clock beside the thing, how do you enable it? I got it ticked in the options but it doesn't show?
---
What's wrong with paladin consecration??
---
This is like watching a cripple fight.
---
I know they weren't the right values, in fact it's well known they were quite a bit above the original actual values. The raids were made purposely harder on pserver devs, this has been known for awhile and honestly I did prefer harder raids, just less of a snoozefest.
---
That's not what they look for. This is incredibly false.
---
Can I DW or do I have to slap a shield on?
---
Who’s Yennefer?
---
Female Gnome Prot Warrior, I love the imagery of something so small tanking huge monsters.
---
He should los the Mana burn if he doesn't he needs to use an elixir of poison resistance to remove it. Other then that thornlings, grenades crystal charges for the imps should be easy.
---
Your addon is causing the problem.  I have no problems with no ui addons.
---
Don't need the pillar there are places to LoS in the tunnel.
---
Truefaith vestments are bis for priests I believe.
---
Yes
---
Those are bind on pickup like everything that is locked behind a reputation wall
---
Not for a long time it hasn't. Unless you have a chat add-on that's messing with it, but if that's the case I'm surprised blizz has that part of the UI be accessed by add-ons.
---
We are playing 1.12 AV, realm transfers existed in 1.12 as well.
---
You can disagree that going with 1.12 was not the optimal choice, but that does not seem to be what you are implying.
---
I do see that more honor in WSG would increase the amount of people that queue for it. But more horde would also queue for it, so I doubt that you would see an improvement in queue times.
---
Resto 100 Mana feral 3 stats imo.
---
R1 frostbolt surely. Also if were being technical OP should get frost book for AV anyway and switch to pve set at drek/vandaar for that sweet sweet parse
---
You describe a strategy with "would be nice if people do it" despite a lot of people already do it. 
---
As an example: "warlocks will have better DPS if they understand itemization in vanilla wasn't good so they can ignore their tier1 sets. It's so easy: but for some reason every lock out there strives to get their 8/8 t1 as soon as possible.  Like do people just not know this stuff or something?"
---
It is though.  
---
They are using stolen accounts to attempt a phishing attack(social eng) against other users.
---
The stolen accounts were aquired either by a different phishing attack or through finding dumped passwords from a separate hack on the web (osint/recon)
---
No matter how they obtain control of the account, it's a hack. It's not glamorous, it's not original, it's not clever. It doesn't take any leet skills or 0days or rces or sqli, but its still a hack.
---
No need to glamourize hacking, it's not the movies.
---
With how easy it is to farm the recipe i don't think it will spike much if at all in price.
---
As I see you have been given your reply which I completely agree with. Alliance queues are instant, so while both ranking factions requeue immediately after they finish their BG, alliance is forced to have another BG right away while horde has a short (or not so short) break.
---
The engineering helmet doesn't work like Mind Vision and it works differently from the priest Mind Control spell. It basically turns your target to a pet that will attack your targets, you can't move him or cast spells/abilities, it's all automated.
---
You guys are pathetic. There is nothing even close to constructive critisicm in OPs post. It's all just comparing what private servers supposedly had better compared to classic.
---
Calling other fascist for calling out your whiny asses is desperate to say the least.
---
And use the Authenticator app, there's no good reason not to.
---
What's aep?
---
I am a lvl 30 gnome in stv, and Im not afraid of anyone. The whirlwind axe boosted my ego too much
---
PvP never drops off, pve the drop off around aq40/naxx. We haven't even got BWL yet so you still got like a year before the drop off really becomes felt imo.
---
it’s beautiful fuck you mean? lol
---
Good luck getting those.
---
No.
---
absolutely love warlock! really easy leveling, pets are helpful, pretty good in pvp. good CC. and free mount which is also the coolest one :D i want to make a rogue and priest alt too
---
Shamans destroy mages. So you have that going for you. 
---
I main a shaman I’m abit biased. I’m a huge fan of totems. And their EE resto pvp build is stupid strong. 
---
Even raid deep resto you’re tough to kill and can usually outlast/heal and shock in between them to death. 
---
Shaman gang gang
---
Do you really think I care what some angry, very sweaty WoW nerds think of me? Of this anonymous account I am going to wipe within the month?
---
I know exactly what all of this is really about, and the irony is sweet. The amount of time the Horde wasted by ganking my guild alone deserves hour long queues into a shit pvp game. The universe seems karmic really, despite any direct evidence.
---
Whatever the case, this is not in any defense of Blizzard, this is ganking horde getting THEIR time wasted now :) I am so happy all of your fun is ruined, and you have no private servers to go to!
---
It just seems like someone was  being overly careful and a little silly. Nothing was was deleted in regards to rule 4 but it does seem like a crappy rule where someone can use the letter of the rule to defeat the spirit of the rule. 
---
The language is bad, I'm sure it was written to be brief and in haste.
---
The idea is not to share the use of cheats, ect, ect.  
---
Stop the promotion of private servers, as this subreddit is for classic wow only. 
---
Changing the language seems appropriate, nobody is going to stop sharing their past experiences and opinions if people enforce this method of ruling, in fact people will just stop interacting. Nobody is being hurt by this.
---
No, fuck off.
---
Locks are in high demand hunter are in low demand (at least on my server). If you wanna walk onto a strong guilds raid core play a lock. If you already have a guild that will let you raid on your alt a hunter might be good.
---
Riiight.
---
Doesn't matter, player attitude isn't gonna change either way. Nerf AV, players will exploit WSG and then blame blizzard
---
I don’t get it? Why you run back and forward?
---
Effectively yes. But the raids themselves are unchanged.
---
I believe he's switching to berserker stance has he charges
---
I don't see them changing this rule. The bigger a subreddit gets, the more they want to align with the views of the parent game to increase the chance they become a corporate pet and blizzard may start posting here more often. Happens with most big game subreddits.
---
Why? Couldn't you get better badge gear?
---
My locks /played to 60 was about 7 days but I afked a lot.
---
Cause they lead to the same issues.
---
See, even then if you get a login attempt on a unknown pc they need e-mail access. And IMO, if you use the same password for anything as your e-mail you almost deserves to get hacked, almost. Certainly that is begging for it.

---
Its cringe reading your sad side bragging man. Some wow players...
---
Core changes to classes is opening Pandora's box. If you want to play a more balanced vanilla then wait for TBC.
---
depression is kinda thicc..
---
It's pathetic
---
Are you sarcastically talking about me?
---
I only mained a fury warrior for my entire time playing wow, so it would be that
---
started in BC when humans were bis and give swords and maces extra stats. which is also a thing in classic, and then eventually swapped to worgen when it was the best.
---
alliance as I mainly pve, and alliance typically have the better pve racials.
---
i did mining / bsing first, then when I get an alt dropped mining for engineering. but with classic and how slow the lving is, my mining / herb alt will be here, by maybe august?
---
now throw in being on a 80/20 horde to ally pop server it just becomes even more frusterating and inconsistant. to the point where players who can just auto click 24h for 7 days in av can compete with bracket 1-2 honor depending on rng. Also they just arnt being banned so thats just adding more problems if u want to maintain all the work youve done so far pushing top ranks
---
Honestly at least on my server your better with herbalism then mining. Killing the last boss at least doubles your run time and you only get a crystal one every 5 runs at best in my experience. Getting 2 stacks of dreamfoil, a stack of gromsblood and a stack of ghost mushrooms is already more gold then an arcane crystal on my server is easily picked up and does not require you to get good rng.
---
Well on my server titan mats are like 80g and the flasks sell for 120-140 occasionally. So depending on how much you want to grind you can turn a good profit. 
---
BWL is also around the corner so alot of people will flask titans including melee dps.
---
pservers always make raids harder. If they sell gear in a shop, it's to sell gear so raids are easier, if they don't sell gear then it's to make people play more on the server. I've done private vanilla, wotlk, and legion and it's all unquestionably more difficult than retail and for those reasons. The vanilla and wotlk especially, those aren't progressive servers, when people hit endgame and get bis, their will to play often leaves so devs have to crank up difficulty to make this process take as long as possible.
---
.
---
Stop pulling numbers out of your ass.
---
The robes are supbar for everyone except Holy Paladin for which it is great and BiS.
---
And Nost II only took off because the Nost team went on a course to learn about marketing befoire they relaunched.
---
I was around and played the BOTH of their realms and in no way were they better than the competition at the time, what they did was produce HYPE, and utilize marketing
---
Wrong! Enchanting makes you a shit ton of gold if your farming dm east. You DE the greens the boss drops into greater eternals and turn a 2g item into 10-14g greater eternals. In general I agree with you enchanting is not a good money maker but I've made close to 1.5k gold selling greater eternals since dm east came out.
---
Im hitting a brick wall right now
---
Your argument is "Mageblade is only a slight upgrade over healer weapons, but a huge upgrade for DPS, so casters should have priority". But at the same time, you could argue " Mageblade is only a slight upgrade over pure caster weapons (e.g. Staff of Dominance), but a huge upgrade for Paladins, so Paladins should have priority".
---
&gt;Healers should be using Guiding Stave of Wisdom
---
Paladins cannot use Staves.
---
Hmm.
---
They've hashed the compromised  passwords and they compare the list of hashes against the hash of the password you type. The password doesn't get sent to them.
---
I'm a tailor enchanting warlock and I make at least 100g an hour doing solo dm east. You disenchant the greens into greater eternals and you turn the felcloth into felcloth gloves. Greater eternals sell for my server for between 6-8 gold and felcloth gloves for 120-140g. If your going to drop one I would suggest tailoring but it depends what recipes you have for each.

Chain heal is a lot less healing though so fairly pants on a tank unless loads of you are spamming it.

Sounds like something a gnome would do!

Falling for this scam is absolutely not hack ofc. Makes me wonder if people fall for it. Presumably yes or they would've given up by now

Zug Zug.

That charatcer data can still be used, for example on an upcoming TBC realm, which I will not name.

What does to Turtle mean? In terms of AV?
---
Wasn't this version of AV mostly out when the Honor Ranking system was replaced with the Honor currency system?

---
Yea seems pretty obvious you dont know shit about this, Nerfed av isnt shorter games, npcs hit Much Harder, especially the archers. In classic they removed moonwalking for some reason?? Lets talk about northdale the last big private server. We used to have 2-3 horde guilds fighting 2-3 ally raids in brm with no lag, imagine that. No shitty batching and the staff never gave stuff to players. If you truly played one of the big private servers you would know that classic would be a shit private server if it was released as one
---
It isn't just different skin colour, they have subtleties with racials first of all, but more importantly is that you can do the same class with different specs at the same time. Smite priest etc

I remember WoW being so fun when I first started playing it, and turtle AVs with a married couple I met was a big reason for it. Everytime I come back to WoW tho it's almost entirely rush it down in 5 mins type games and really ruins the experience. Was considering coming back to WoW Classic this time but apparently not even that will save it I guess? Such a shame people wanna get back out of a game instead of actually playing it and having a battle...in battleground.
---
True I just didn't want him to buy the mount on his main only to find out he can't mail it to his alt.
---
There's probably a funny joke about Macs in there but I'm not smart enough to make it.
---
Since it requires a computer restart could it be a mouse problem? Did you do anything different with that? 
---
Did you check the ingame camera settings before and after it happens? Camera pan has some settings that might be screwing with you. Also check if you don't have some camera commands bound to any of your keyboard/mouse key and you're accidentaly pressing that.
---
Can u give me an example? Sorry just cant find any good youtube guides for this
---
You say that but tonnes of people still struggle with onyxia
---
Guildie fell for it 2 days ago, luckily he has 2factor auth and changed his password immediately after i screeched at him.

Lmfaoooo
---
Was actually hosted by one of the biggest data center's in France.
---
You are clueless, BWL was always the best and most popular phase or pservers
---
Which is exactly why all experienced players roll need. Other players just don't know, or don't understand the value of specific items.
---
Sell tank services. Farm jump runs in a duo, strat live as three. Farm eye of shadows as a duo. Any of the usual spots are decent farm if you can play on off times for your server (elemental fire, water essences depending on your server).
---
Well in retail People stop playing once they reach the end or finish any of the raids too and if there is a new expansion they come back and if not they don’t 
---
Well with classic people might stop leveling bc they feel that the game is dead once they are there and if it won’t be revived there is no point 
---
But as soon as sth is announced or out most come back
---
Tellmewheeeen
---
I wish it was this empty on our server ...
---
Youre probably gonna crush bwl in like 2-3 hours as well. And ZG basically feels like running ubrs.
---
Are you supposed to not take seal of command at lvl 20 when leveling a paladin? When leveling my other alts I noticed quite a lot of ret paladins (with details so I can inspect them) dont have it. I didnt ask them then but now I am lvling a paladin a bit myself so I am curious.
---
short term gains or long term investment. I would learn it personally.
---
Same. Never seen shoulders drop. I'm 7/8 t1 with rhok delar. 8/8 is a bitch for me.
---
Wow head has definitely helped me a ton but still any discussion there is like a decade old and I’ve read some misleading things that don’t relate to the classic version we are playing.. still love that shit though wouldn’t be this far without it
---
You should have about 4 locks and they should all be able to use corruption, regardless of spec. If you have a shadow priest, one or two might fall short - so you proioritize those with SM/Ruin.
---
Regardless of spec, it's a DPS increase.
---
&gt; No let's mention them you have Lucy where you don't need to max range, gehenas again don't need to max range, garr you can easily position yourself to multi corrupt and banish, Sulfron you aoe down so all in melee range, golemagg the adds are tanked within 30 yards of you, and Domo you aoe down and even if you don't range isn't an issue.
---
&gt; Lucy where you don't need to max range
---
But you still have to multidot and -DKP if you curse the MC target, obviously. Mage though? Frost bolt xN.
---
Magmadar? Back and forth, max range fight. MAges? Frost bolt again. We are already at 2:0
---
Gehennas? Multidot again. See I don't think you understand that for dots to be efficient, you have to understand how long the mob is going to be alive. Obviously, it's not worth dotting them when they are on 10% hp. Mages though? Frostbolt.
---
Garr? Multidot, always watching on broken Banish (god forbid you are in the middle of GCD or the mobs are not positioned well). Mages? Frostbolt once again.
---
The only fight that mages get to do anything is Domo, but even that gets AoE'd down in certain guilds.
---
So yeah, we should really not go through it.
---
The mindset that Alliance and Horde players are fundamentally different and deserve different treatment (e.g. justifying 25minute queues) is Neanderthal levels of tribalism. Fascism requires that same mindset, just with the addition of violence. In practice that’s a massive difference of course, but in theory they’re pretty close.
---
Hate that for us.
---
I sure hope so.
---
&gt;At least with the cut content, it would be just adding it back into the game instead of the extra stuff that people don't trust nu-blizzard to create and be good. I'm sure there is plenty of work someone in the blizzard vault as reference material for the cut content.
---
Blizzard doesn't have backups of vanilla wow before 1.12  that's why they had to release classic at the latest most broken patch. Knowing this I highly doubt they have this cut content just sitting around somewhere just waiting to be implemented it would have to be recreated from scratch.
---
Done this a lot on my mage, you can stand at the entrance as well. First target gorulak so you face the right direction then target jed
---
Agility equivalency points, easy way of simplifying strength of various stats.
---
Kiddo confirmed!
---
It should also be pointed out that once your guild is clearing bwl you can also just invite a friend to a “raid” walk up in the instance and there’s an alchemy lab you can use in there. I’m pretty sure the trash doesn’t respawn. Either that or my druid stealthed to it.
---
can you send me your discord? I have some logs I can show you from tonight's raid.
---
if you're at the door you dont need spyglass. can just /target
---
While this may be amusing it is also very true.  Many gamers are using escapism to deal with real life issues, sometimes compounding them.  Mental health is a serious issue and there will be at least one person in this world that has played wow to help them stop thinking about real life issues for a few minutes/hours/days.
---
can you check my logs if I send them to you? can you please keep it private though? I'd love to pick your brain. I want to know how to use these logs to help my team.
---
I cannot image Blizzard not doing TBC. It is a lot of money for not that much work.
---
So in TBC there were no talent changes? Arena gear? Badge gear?
---
Wow, how disgusting can the alliance be.
---
This is good advice, always handy to see extra uses for some of the engineering gadgets.
---
Stonespine is on my list of rares to farm, as I hear the cloak he drops is white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape...
---
Is there plenty of mana?   
---
Either way, I kind of feel encouraged to roll a priest.
---
I think he is talking about the Nostalrius that lead to Classic being released because, you know, that server is actually relevant. 
---
I think he is also talking about Northdale for that same reason.
---
How is he making money of lashes? Just going for raw gold?
---
Hey hey hyped man grizzly just left stalag, wonder if they went to heartseeker.
---
Maybe talk with Enhancementshaman, he just told me I'm wrong.
---
Honest but maybe unpopular answer here...
---
This game is old and has been conquered in many ways so there are lots of resources:
---
Get your bis list and start grinding out those preraid bis items. Then get your raid bis!
---
Get a guide on maximizing your class's pve dps.
---
Learn engineering and read up on how to pvp as your class.
---
Farm rep! I find it relaxing...just hit exalted with argent dawn! There's probably great AV rewards as well.
---
This is from a total nerd's perspective but it is a good endgame strategy. Have fun!
---
You know the auction house says the name of the person who put up the auction right? If there's 10 pages of black diamonds at 19g a pop all listed by the same person it's pretty easy to figure out what happened.
---
Most people have their t2 pants and legs and with no gear to replace them with till BWL at the earliest the demand plummets. Add in that phase 4 adds in much much better enchants from zg there's even less of a reason to stock up on them.
---
I'm not disagreeing with most of your points nor am I trying to invalidate most of what you said, BUT I do take extreme issue with your 5% statement. If feral, ret or enhance dps was 5% behind rogues and warriors; I'd be playing one of them. It's more like 60% behind. If you compare the top rogue and warrior dps to the top hybrid dps, it's not even close. It gets even more bleak when you realize that top feral and ret dps have to invest insane resources, some at the expense of other dps that would benefit much more, in order to pull those numbers. Ferals have to farm a gimmick item for hours just to compete with mediocre similarly geared rogues. Rets have to utilize multiple PI's in order to compete with a mediocre rogue. The nail in the coffin is that rogues are 20-30% behind warriors in those same fights. 
---
It's not 5%. It's like 50%.
---
Playing games all day, gee I wonder who wouldn't be depressed.
---
Macro issue. I'm using
---
showtooltip Mark of the wild
---
/cast [nomod][mod:alt,@player][] Mark of the wild
---
/cast [mod:shift] Gift of the wild
---
The first line works correctly, i use the alt modifier to be able to buff myself while still having another player targeted. The second line doesn't work. Any ideas?
---
I can't not DoT a passing gnome
---
Hmm
---
True. But the lag doesn't really have anything to do with that.
---
&gt;Which part? The ones where GMs got caught selling level 60s to Chinese gold farmers? Or when they fed tier 3 to guilds during AQ? lol
---
That was Elysium, the people who used Nostalriuses core YEARS later... not the Nost team..
---
Check your graphics settings and make sure that your graphics card is selected. This happened to a few people who found that their integrated video card had been selected over their discrete card.
---
Those are some cute neckbeards
---
Who's Jed?
---
While their voice emotes are indeed superior, the jokes from male dwarfs are more alcohol centric. I am still torn. But dwarfs overall &gt; everything
---
The stairs as soon as you port in I mean. So basically takes about 5 seconds to see if Jed is there.
---
If theyre sporting an mc level weapon yeah.  Undead rogues are rough.  If i use consumes it changes, keeping invuln pots for undead rogues but that gets expensive fast.
---
PvP makes open world levelling way more interesting for me, it adds a layer of politics and complexity to the game. Dying to a level 60 occasionally is fine, I don't know why people find that some traumatizing experience. The good outweighs the bad heavily. 
---
But what happened in Phase 2 has nothing to do with that. Trying to attack people who said "PvP servers are the best type" with what happened in Phase 2 is unfair and stupid.
---
Hunters can level to 60 in greys without dying once, gear doesn't fucking matter on hunters.
---
You obviously never played those servers because there certainly was phasing/lag in zone transitions. People would disappear.
---
How so? And as a priest specifically?
---
F R E S H is what they did. It's the single biggest private server meme.
---
And your "thinking that the private servers that did this are perfect" is not a stupid blanket statement, that gives no shit to anything aside your own entitlement?
---
SAVIOUR!!! 🙏🙏🙏
---
Don’t delete your characters if you want them back.
---
I'd recommend going outside now and then, too.
---
That would depend on how it was coded. It could be coded so that on cast it has a chance to proc and if it procs everything hit is affected.
---
To focus on defending the opposite faction's push, rather than forming a push of your own.
---
Basically you defend until the other faction is out of position/fragmented enough that you can win through a counter push.
---
Lol!
---
I was kidding
---
Why have you concealed everything?
---
Years...
---
You're absolutely entitled to your own opinions, and there are LOTS of people who agree with you. But for me, WPvP, as aimless as it is, just gets in the way of things I'm actually interested in doing. There's no benefit to engaging another player beyond impeding them in whatever they're doing, and a tiny bit of honor--neither of which, frankly, I am at all interested in anyway. 
---
I'm sorry if I came off as hostile, but I'm pretty tired of seeing PvP servers presented as the "true" or "most authentic" way of experiencing Classic, because it feels coercive, and for some percent of players won't add value to their experience.
---
I fully agree and have been saying this but unfortunately no-one wants to listen - #NOCHANGES was the worst thing to happen to classic. Initially it started out as "no transmog, no flying mounts,..." internally in the community - but it went too far, and people started mindlessly applying it to everything. Blizzard of course welcomed it with both hands.
---
As long as it isn’t at the cost of your life around you, this is something that is 100% ok and to feel good about.
---
Game's literally only alive because of private servers. Get a grip.
---
People that like that.
---
Blizzard invested and is going to invest least amount of money possible.
---
If you just dinged 60 you either started playing 2-3 months late, or you play a couple hours a week, most real gamers hit 60 first few weeks.
---
If they cater any game to you naxx would be released in 2025, fuck that.
---
I used to play WoW nonstop, but since classic has come out my main is only 43. I’ve learned to enjoy the game in moderation (thanks loading screen tip!) and it makes it all the better. I can’t wait to try MC one day far far off lmao
---
Every gnome has to die, specially the pink haired ponytails.
---
So...all horde rogues?
---
Hide it? Why?
---
Yup. I have a lvl60 Horde Warrior and I'm currently lvling a Paladin (lvl54). Westfall had surprisingly few quests. You have to go out to practically every other zone Alliance has to offer (Darkshore, Loch Modan, Westfall for reaching lvl20 alone). Despite having way more quests as a whole they seem to yield a lot less experience. And a ton of quest start and end in the main cities, so you have to travel back and forth a lot. If it wasn't for Zygor i had to grind a lot, which isn't fun as a Paladin.
---
how do you play an alt without losing your spot in queue? every time i try this i get booted
---
Of course it can be interesting, and there's far more to it than "impending someone in whatever they're doing". I honestly feel kinda sad for you because there are so many funny and awesome moments that make your levelling experience way less boring.
---
There's nothing better than getting a huge crit and killing some dick three levels above you ganking you, or getting revenge on a player who's killed you in the past, or having your little group of friends and an opposing factions group of friends trying to do the same quest, and everything starts out peaceful and eventually it ends in a brawl.
---
Trying to sum up world PvP as "griefing" is just honestly condescending, or makes you sound like a bitter person who can't handle 30 seconds running back to his corpse once in a while. I don't know.
---
We have Death Coil, Howl of Terror, and Fear. Fear can only be used against one target at a time.
---
Should read nedder123 comment then.
---
so its the horde's fault you rolled on the wrong side of an imbalanced pvp server?
---
Fuck.
---
if they just nerf the insanely high honor gain from av (where win or lose doesn't even matter) and bring it down to a somewhat balanced level it would help A LOT
---
Epics aren't that big of a deal compared to 5% crit and 140 AP. And to be clear he said full pre-bis blues, not just some rando freshly capped leveling-arms specced warrior you picked up for your pug.
---
Fury warriors don't have many gear upgrades, so it takes time for their upgrades to grow in aggregate. The ony buff is constant over the lifetime of classic, and hits pre-bis fury warriors right in the spot where they still benefit heavily from more crit, the 25% zone.
---
5pc nightslayer is actually pretty good man that 10 energy allows for a much better rotation. It's even stronger in PvP
---
Don't feel sad for me. I tried PvP servers in Classic, and I started out on a PvP server in retail TBC. There are of course occasional memorable and fun moments, but most PvP interactions--*for me*\--aren't either of those things. I don't especially find revenge to be satisfying, same for initiating ganks on other players. 
---
I suppose it does make peaceful interactions with the other faction more meaningful, but for me that's outweighed pretty heavily by the aspects of PvP servers that I don't like. I much, much prefer cooperative gameplay in WoW. I don't enjoy feeling like someone else's enjoyment comes at the cost of my own, and I don't enjoy putting other players in that position either.
---
It is pretty reductive to call all WPvP griefing, but that's just my perspective, and like I said, it's frustrating to see PvP servers presented as if they're the only valid way of playing Classic.
---
R
---
This is because the horde leveling zones were designed after the alliance ones. 
---
You'll notice the early alliance zones, especially the human areas of Elwyn and Westfall, are really tied together with a bunch of quests that relate to each other. 
---
When it was time for Blizzard to design the horde areas, they were a little more crunched for time and they had already figured out how to design zones so that's why everything feels so much more streamlined and straightforward.
---
at least it's fun to play wsg and takes some skill to win
---
Yes, one showcasing the hypocrisy of calling a 3-in-1 one shot
---
Woke up to a notification from my Blizzard app that someone from china tried to log in. Its so fucking sad
---
mage
---
I mean, grinding gold does not appeal in the slightest to a lot of pvpers.
---
It's been a pretty good outlet for me, started making dumb memes for my guild discord. This happen to be one of the ones I thought would be worth posting. Moderation is definitely key, it's just nice to come back home from a long day at work to a fun community.
---
Honestly at this point just join a guild, never understood why everyone and their mother must be a GM. Most guilds fail or dont get off the ground bc of several things like, poor guild management, bad GM, other guilds are clearing content. 
---
There are many reasons why, plus there are a lot of people that are guileless bc they dont want a guild.
---
&gt; Come on, again. The private servers were hosted in the basement of some guy. Blizzard is an industry giant. If you take that into consideration, the private server devs were on the fucking spot all the time.
---
Why does this come up every time, most if not all of the well knows pservers werent hosted in basements, they we hosted at professional hosting company's in professional datacentres. For example Nost was hosted at OVH ( https://www.ovh.com/world/ )
---
Forget Titan Grip. Dual wielding demons is where it's at.
---
People who manage to get infected by keyloggers.
---
The most usual way to get infected is clicking on every link you find, everywhere.
---
Pvp is not pvp if you can't fight back, is it?
---
We owe all of this to private servers. It is appalling that it was ever banned.
---
When I streamed I had some guy in my chat who spent hours and hours trying to get me to delete system 32. I guess he thought he was funny. I just ignored him.
---
"real gamers" lmao
---
During the early av days of classic when everyone on alliance was grinding exalted, most of the best geared tanks consistently rode 60s.
---
Go get a job/some friends/go back to school
---
Just reached lvl 50, done with (a few quests left currently doing) Searing gorge, Tanaris, Hinterlands and Blasted lands. Where do I go now?
---
It's definitely a experience to full clear MC, my guild did it a few weeks ago with only 2 ppl left remaining
---
T
---
For casuals and non-hardcores, yes it is.
---
As an aside, I would recommend not doing this because Blizzard can and may ban you for benefiting from botting, even though you yourself are not running the botting software yourself, because Blizzard believes in guilty by association, even if that association is combating botting activities.
---
I get it, and people like you are why PvE servers should and do exist. But like, it's the World of WARcraft. It's in the name! I dunno, to me it's what makes the world feel alive, and makes doing even the most menial tasks when levelling interesting. The whole fundamental concept of the game is about two factions who are at war. It's why when I was a kid I preferred WoW over Guild Wars (underrated game).
---
Like to me, Vanilla at least is a relatively simple and boring game outside of raiding and battle grounds, world PvP gives it that spice that it needs, IMO.
---
Priest is only the best healer on alliance in 5 mans where they can truly AoE heal. On Horde they compete with Shamans for that title. 
---
In raids, their ability to AoE heal goes out the window. Healing 5 people out of 40 isn’t AoE. The best raid healers in classic are Shamans. The best snipe/spot healers are Paladins and it isn’t close. To say Priest is the best healer through any of classic let alone all of it is nothing but bias/disinformation
---
It's pretty much BIS until MC loot or tarnished elven rings  at 60 for feral since it has armor on it.
---
    [nomod][mod:alt,@player][] Mark of the Wild
---
What this line means is: 
---
`[nomod]` if you press the key with no modifier, cast MOTW.  
---
`[mod:alt,@player]` If you press the key holding alt, cast MOTW at yourself.  
---
`[]` Otherwise, cast MOTW at your target or cast MOTW at yourself (assuming auto self-cast is enabled).  
---
So obviously it never gets to your second line because `[]` is a catch-all.  
---
Here's what I would use for what you're wanting: 
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Gift of the Wild; [mod:alt,@player][] Mark of the Wild
---
is there some addon that auto loots item that i want
---
basicly i press on corpse and if there is "linen cloth" it auto loots it
---
Their point is that a lit of people consider it optimal to run around with one (perhaps only outside of raids) anyway
---
Keep pushing mate.
---
Even if I post this I'm actually on SSRI and a bunch of other meds. But I did go to the doctor and unveiled what happened to me.
---
Now I'm OK when I'm alone, some stuff in life can really fuck you up, but I believe in the "not broken, rebuild harder".
---
If you can find help, and its possible for a majority of people in this subreddit, try to go.
---
Why would a bot Invite you randomly?
---
Usually first orb goes to tank. Then everyone (including tank) gets to roll on the rest. When you have an orb you stop rolling. Keeps it fair.
---
No if anything it just adds a little extra time on raid night. In terms of the long grind it doesn't necessarily add all that much time overall.
---
I'm 3000/12000
---
Did you only do intrusions or all 3 quests?
---
Grats man, gl on your gear grind
---
Theres an in game option to activate auto loot. Cant check where atm as im not at home.
---
Love giantstalker! We’re disenchanting our gs shoulders now though they have dropped every week but one for 9 weeks. Got 6/8 so far, but we have 5 hunters and we haven’t seen a single helm and only 2 chest and one legs.
---
Remove the [] in first line, it makes Mark of the wild cast no matter the condition. Also you can just have \#showtooltip at the top and it will change the icon depending on what spell will be used
---
I dont generally like people tbh, just need more games to kill time.
---
Kill the allies, corpse camp them, make them unsub.
---
I had 4000 HKs in world pvp phase. Some of them unsubbed.
---
Horde won the war.
---
i didnt even bothered reading but nost/lb/northdale was far from classic. too much hardcore ppl stacked on a massive 10k+ pop server.
---
that wasnt ''true vanilla experience'' cause that cant exist anymore, and frankly, only ppl that havent played on pservers wanted that. we justed wanted a ''fresh'' server that was under blizzard tag and would run smoother and have no huge bugs etc.
---
but then came layering, scuffed servers launches, wpvp, itemization progression being weird, spell batching, leeway, etc.
---
anyways, i just cringe every time ppl say ''vanilla experience''. which was pretty much 2k noobs on a server having no idea what to do. hell, killing broodlord took 10 fucking minutes lmao. i def dont want that experience.
---
Which is weird, half the time it is a free pull with two adds and I would say he drops the 5g mace 50% of the time?
---
25s per player is not a ton, but it usually does not cost time as this is a place where people move up anyway and drakes are what could do damage.
---
Username checks out
---
His post was about leaving horde stalagg. Im sorry to see the ally menace as I legit had 0 HK until BGs.
---
But horde is still fine and with cross realm BGs every realm is eventually going to be favored mostly by horde and a few by ally.
---
The server itself for horde is still great. Im sorry that it's not for you.
---
When I did it on my priest, it dropped within the first three kills. That's why this was so frustrating. I cleared all the elementals three times and waited for them to respawn.
---
FR E SHA VOCA DO
---
You should have searched youtube before trying to re-invent the wheel.
---
It is a way to think about something else. Some people read books, watch movies, go walking, go meet people. It all depends on your personnality. As an introvert person, I see WoW as a way to recover energy and mental stability after having to meet lots of people (to much for me) at work. Without WoW (or video games), I think I would have suffered of much more troubles.
---
seduction may as well be a fear.
---
Crusader only drops from one type of enemy in the game, The Scarlet Spellbinders in Tyr's Hand. 0.5% drop.
---
The highest voted reply is utterly moronic. Search YouTube instead of listening to someone that tried to re-invent the wheel to farm the wand in *2 weeks* when all you expect to need are a handful of strats.
---
We had a wipe on sulfuron because one of the tanks thought it would be fine to go without waiting on healer mana... Poor ony buff :(
---
&gt; I dont understand the thought process. I need nothing else in the group yet I'm greedy for wanting something for my time? If a dps didn't need something in there I'm sure they'd farm gold somehow else. I just enjoy helping others gear up.
---
You're perfectly entitled to form a group with whatever rules you want, that doesn't mean people have to join your group (it's a different issue entirely if they're aware of what rules you've put in place and yet still moan about it).
---
Haha lol, this is precious!
---
I've done my share of pugs, and even helped out a few other guilds when they were lacking manpower, but I've only been in 2+ hr raids in pugs. Maybe I've been lucky, but most guild are running pretty smooth by now.
---
TIL you need a bot to auto-run.
---
Ungoro is that many quests?
---
Jed's dead baby, Jed's dead.
---
Right but I guess I see things *Slightly* differently given how my characters work. One of them is the gatherer, the other is producer. As I said above my rogue has mining &amp; herbalism, and my mage has engineering and alchemy. My rogue gathers the professions for my mage to use. I didn’t sell the recipe, and everyone clicked need roll, even 2 people who admitted they just did it for gold. I still go bitched out. It sounds like according to the majority of comments that the general consensus is that because they didn’t set a precedent before hand &amp; everyone else rolled on it it was fine.
---
So play other games. You won't find one single game to kill all your free time forever, especially if you don't like people in an mmo.
---
Lol why is everyone defending the obvious use of afk bots here? You guys know the AV-afk-bots is just an autorunner right?
---
That's quite easy: if people like you are majority, then you shouldn't have a problem finding a party. If people like you are a minority, then it's hard to expect Blizzard catering to you while they see the majority quit the game out of boredom.
---
Good
---
the only time I have seen them despawn is when they get upgraded from handins. everything briefly despawns and is replaced with the upgraded units. Perhaps if you cap it at just the right time you can stop the newer ones spawning?
---
I just finished getting exalted yesterday, and I spent a lot of time in those towers killing those bowmen.
---
Yup in comparison to give you an idear there where 123 guilds that cleared MC on Northdale (the last big vanilla pserver before classic) and only 16 who cleared Naxx.
---
That doesnt include chinese guilds because they usually dont have logs.
---
Sorry for your loss my friend
---
unthinkable
---
I play undead for the same reason most people play human: they look the most like me irl
---
and I play warlock because I'm a troll at heart, fear dot dot dot /lol /bye is just the best way to pvp :D
---
\+best dance +teabag racial +warlock-1v1-counter-racial
---
Classic plays 99% like K3. K3 died 5months in after a huge initial wave played and then left due to poor design decisions like giving the updated PvP gear around BWL patch (see the trend)?
---
Someone needs to test it and report in. Does Eagle Eye allow you to /target jed because it extends your clients load range.
---
If so, the answer to " **How to fish for Jed instantly with 100% accuracy (You've been doing it wrong this entire time)** " is tell your huntard about it...
---
Probably for saying "ye." Folks on the 'net have been getting really tired of seeing/hearing that.
---
what are all the objectives that award bonus honor to your team in AV?
---
What does the /yell you did translate to for the horde?
---
people like that are not gonna be competitive with the actual rank grinders
---
Sounds like pvp happened in a bg
---
&gt; It comes up time every time because the pserver staff (devs, CMs, GMs etc) was almost entirely made up of volunteers or paid with donated money. 
---
That has nothing to do with hardware being hosted in a basement though. That part just generally isn't true. Pserver were generally all hosted at professional large scale hosting companies. 
---
The main problem is, is that ppl don't seem to compare Apples to Apples, but Apples to Oranges. Unless pservers implement the same aniticheat measures and serverside validation you can't really compare the 2, as atleast to me as a server engineer the pserver foundation feels vastly inferior. 
---
That being said, i think that a lot of the comments overexaggerated. I for example am playing on a medium to high Classic server in EU and the experience has been really good i have to say. It hardly ever lags, even in BRM or worldbosses it has not been really bad from what i've experienced and definately not like some of the movies that had been posted here. All in all the overall experience is a lot better than on Pserver in general, a lot less crashes for example. All in all both classic and pserver have their flaws compared to how vanilla was, mostly induced by over population that has been a big problem in both pservers and classic. But all in all i don't think Classic is being ran that poorly.
---
Works every time.
---
Could you at least tell us what server you're at lol
---
Have not tested it with eagle eye, but as a hunter I just run up the ramp near where the door opens and feign death. Then I can /tar Jed which works 100% of the time and is pretty easy.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
Except nah because it breaks on any instance of damage and you're kept completely still instead of running around/potentially away from the enemy.
---
This pic speaks far more to me then I’d like to admit.
---
That's not what I meant when I typed this but it did pop into my fron so good for you for picking up my unintentional reference!
---
I have used WoW myself as a way of taking down time, I have also slipped far down the rabbit hole at times, ignoring real life responsibility.  WoW has been part of my life since the original beta to varying degrees, its a safe place that never changes for me azeroth doesnt change even though the people do.  I have played on dozens of private realms, as well as classic and original vanilla.  It has taken me many years to find a good balance, between life and escapism.    
---
I was a proud member of the emulation community trying to keep vanilla alive for many years, and at times I spent FAR too much time trying to play vanilla.  Now Classic is available, and I always have a private realm to go to, I feeel I no longer need to invest dozens or even hundreds of hours a week, just dip myself in for a couple of hours then get on with my life.  Knowing I have that safe environment where I feel comfortable being myself, is a huge relief when I am having a hard time.  My kids been driving me nuts for 4 hours, or my day at work was aweful, no worries 10pm tonight I can log into WoW chat with some buddies and maybe do a  quest on an alt.  
---
You can find more information on my views on gaming and mental health in one of the really old countdown to classic podcasts if you are interested.
---
NEW F R E S H happened. 
---
It was awesome. It was hype. I understand where the Classic+ crowd is coming from but Classic+ is going to be shit (because Blizzard) and NEW F R E S H is will be 10 times more awesome. Yes. I will die on this hill.
---
Watch this video and a lot of your questions will be answered  
---
[https://youtu.be/lLD12oUwJoE](https://youtu.be/lLD12oUwJoE)
---
My server has came full circle. We que, we hearth, we camp alliance until it pops. Those horde players are still waiting in the world for you. The longer the que times the worse it will get.
---
I would say like 28ish for graveyard and also i have to ask why would you level Another mage?
---
I wonder if that kind of logical fallacy has a name.
---
„A and B“ does not imply that „A“ implies „B“.
---
Probably something with causality in it.
---
Undead warlock for wotf but the running animation is a big plus, reminds me of /r/tippytaps
---
Then why is he lumping Daemon and Viper together with the dirtbag Crogge and Shenna?
---
Nost wasn't the shady shit crew, they even tried to get the code back once they saw what criminal energy Crogge showed (working with goldsellers etc.).
---
well it's required to have summon gear if you're a mage. you were asking about mage so i just listed what i know about their gold making
---
People on my server 2 man or 3 man live so we rarely have orb res because these 2 people will just split all the orbs and gold and it's a non issue so the people who are 5 maning it are there for gear or xp so orbs tend to be round robin for them.
---
Right, and this is important to note because 30% Vael is 900k HP, and Rag is a million, pre-submerge rag is sub 3minutes and vael just happens to be 3 minutes too. So with the unlimited rage/mana/energy, assuming you can handle threat properly, the DPS check will be an non-issue if you already kill rag pre submerge, even with the forced deaths on vael.
---
shadowpanther.net is a good start
---
This exactly.  Azeroth is the safe place people go to, when RL is really bad, people with depression or anxiety will naturally want to spend more time there.  It can be both a good and bad thing, its about balance, some people find it others dont.
---
... Or NEW FRESH, as we called it. The hype was real.
---
No, Northdale sucked, mods were corrupt. You’d get banned with false positives and it took a week for mods to reverse it. Chinese farmers were blatant, unmoderated, and ran/ruined the economy. 60s chain camped every low level contested zone 24/7. 
---
Classic was a breath of god damn fresh air.
---
People see "reserved" and then automatically think you are a selfish prick. They think that since *they* need something from that dungeon themselves, then you must too so drops should be fairly distributed. They don't realize that decked out tanks need nothing from Strat live. They don't understand that the group wouldn't even be forming if it weren't for the tank.
---
Luckily people are starting to catch on and the people who complain about reserve runs get called out for it.
---
I partly blame this sub for this mentality. During the early days people were incredibly sour and angry at people reserving items, and this spread throughout the game community.
---
Long que times for horde only means you will still be camped anywhere you go in the world.
---
Yeah the fresh server launches were really awesome though.
---
My ignore list includes people who whine about reasonable group encounters because, the second that
---
&gt;someone moaned in chat and convinced 1 person to leave
---
they no longer exist to me. They are removed and never interacted with again. Suggest you do the same. 
---
You get the first orb and can either include yourself in the five person round robin or let the other four people roll for ensuing orbs.
---
As much as I hate bots, this ain't videoproof of him botting at all... He could be AFK and just do some weird moves with one hand while standing up eating a sandwich to not get kicked.
---
What you're doing is a witch-hunt with nowhere near sufficient proof to go after someone like that. I agree that it's extremely suspicious and it's likely he's indeed botting but you cannot state it like that, claming you have proofs when you don't.
---
Because he has no clue.
---
I hope this as well. MC is pretty much just heal sniping. There is no need to communicate or organise how healers work. Top heal numbers are always pulled by priests who pretty much 100% flash heal and snipe all those heals. Most priest I also see are running out of mana quite soon due flash heal spam. And it's fine as bosses take around 1min to kill. I hope those priests know that they can't continue like that once bosses take longer to kill.
---
Hey now, they have a couple orc ones too.
---
Exactly. K3 saw a mass exodus when Northdale launched one month later.
---
If the tank needs nothing why are they doing it?
---
Delusional
---
Watch Skarm on YouTube, he is all about warrior and Druid tanking, for aoe I suggest demo shout and make sure your the only one using battle shout, because battle shout also gives threat
---
The scholo requirement killed any interest I had in mounts. And you need highly scalped herbs with flasks like black lotus and silver sage. The profit wasn’t nearly as big as I expected when I did the math... so I sold my supreme power recipe. Lol
---
The truth is, AOE tanking is extremely hard for warriors, especially in the 50s. Biggest thing is know the pulls, know what mobs are dangerous, which have to be tanked, and which can be ignored.  Heavy hitting melee mobs are dangerous to leather/clothies, but casters/healers really arn't.  Throw a skull up on one of them and let the dps worry about it. 
---
Honestly 90% of tanking is knowing the pulls. Knowing what corners to use on which packs, which mobs are the most dangerous. And which to kill first.  Corner pulling, is essential in every high level instance.  At this point in the game, everyone basically knows all the pulls, so if you need help, just ask someone in the group where you should be pulling to.  
---
The point of corner pulling, is to group up the mobs, casters, melee, etc.  Then you can actually sorta-aoe them.  If you are arms spec,  Use Sweeping Strikes on every single pull.  If not.  Use Cleave, tab and sunder, and revenge.  If you are feeling frisky, you can also pool 25 rage and swap to berserker stance for a quick whirlwind. on cooldown.
---
NOw.  If you have those annoying aoe classes that open with AOE attacks, there is nothing you can do.  Your job is to make sure the healer doesn't die.  Then make sure you dont die.  Then worry about the dps. If they pull threat, then they can tank it until I get everything else under control.
---
melee is much more fun to play in PvE
---
TBC had it all. A lot of raids, insane lore moment of WoW (Illidan), still felt like classic wow AND had arena!
---
You are going to get absolutely awful xp in smgy before level 27 or so. You gain reduced xp from mobs much higher level than you. My buddy was running his lvl 25 alt and my level 3x alt through gy. The lowest level mobs there were actually gray for me (I think they are 28?). I was just there for an item and to help the level average drop lower for him and to activate group xp bonus. I was receiving almost 2x the xp his level 25 character was even with some mobs being gray to me. You don't want to go in at too low of a level.
---
 "Prove that he didn’t have an epileptic seizure and the tonic clinic activity didn’t result in him mashing his hands on the keyboard while autorun was on. "
---
kinda what you're saying right now, but not joking
---
sure I don't have proof of him downloading some bot and using it, but its obvious what hes doing. I could have recorded for longer but whats the point? do you really think this isn't proof enough? what would be sufficient proof for you lmao
---
Heaps, you can also hit up felwood, there’s some quests there but they’re spread out - not really a hub. 
---
As you get closer to 60 there’s quests in winterspring too! (Would recommend 56+ for that zone). 
---
Lots of grinding and quest xp in black rock depths and maraudon (if you’ve not been there already).
---
I am playing a shadow priest and have two friends with a mage and an enhancement shaman. Are there any good gold faming methods for two or three people out of this pool? It doesn't need to be super min-maxed. It would just be more fun to farm together than doing solo dungeon runs.
---
Exactly. Tanks need nothing from the instance except the orbs.
---
They wanted to catch you slipping haha.
---
My vote is for new fresh. It's worked for 15 years. Why wouldn't it work now? 
---
TBC was the beginning of the downfall.
---
I couldn't believe how badly the UBRS arena event was tuned on K3. All people just stacking on the side to AoE the waves.
---
On Nost/ND you had to fear/hibernate/frosttrap the flametongues as soon as they were out of the gate, otherwise 2x flamebuffer, 2x blast wave, 2x fire blast could nuke a 5k health warrior in two global cool down. All dragonkins were taunt immune. You were in fight the whole duration, healers had to work with their mana, people had to bandage between waves, so the healers could save up mana.It was a fun and engaging encounter with Gyth + Rend at the end as the cherry on top.
---
Then I played classic's version: Oh...
---
Because otherwise there would be an even worse shortage of tanks. They're fulfilling a need and using it to generate gold equal to what ever other farming they could be doing.
---
I think this is true for a lot of gaming.
---
At the height of the P2 madness, when I was doing my 8th corpse run on my way to BRD, I saw two Hordies dueling in the tunnel near the instance portal. I waited for my resurrection next to the losing player, and when he lost, I Holy Nova'd to finish him off. The other guy didn't even attack me after that. I ran into another Horde group that did, though.
---
&gt; wondrous game design
---
Oh fuck
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
I play since launch...my played was 14 days and 9 hours for 60. I have work you know. Also, I would have hit it a month eariler if not for Horde locking down my server before BGs were out. I am pretty sure I spent at least 3 days corpse walking...
---
No, Naxx out after 1,5-2 years would be fine with me.
---
depression will destroy you, trust me.
---
seek help.
---
My advice (and I get that this is a rarity in this day and age) is have a public name/shame (even if it is only your own guild website/discord).
---
+ List by &lt;Guild&gt;&lt;Player&gt;: The stupid stunt they pulled
---
***
---
If you're going to expose yourself to 'pick-up-groups' you need to be willing to swing whatever power you can grasp in your hand (either as an individual, or a guild). Even if it ends up seeming petty, the behavior that you don't like, many others are unlikely to like as well. Fundamentally that's how 'guilds' are supposed to be (collective of like minded people/shared interests). If you refuse to party with those people going forward (and so does your guild/friends/anyone-who-doesn't-like-playing-with-tools) then they screw themselves off the server.
---
Dont use blink, try to get "of the eagle" greens, use level 1 frost nova. Learn coc kiting.
---
Why is this even necessary?  People take time to get to UBRS, I've not once not had time to do 3-4 resets just standing in the corner and waiting 90 seconds.
---
It takes 10 minutes usually for people to fly to BRM.
---
The first words our raid hears every Onyxia fight:
---
"*You're going to DPS very VERY slowly.*"
---
Threat management is as much a DPS role as it is a tank role.
---
Good job ignoring all of the negatives that came from Private Servers like account selling by Admins and all the other corrupt shit that happened.
---
I usally reserv first orb for myself if im going with randoms since i dont need anything and i have pretty much full bis gear untill bwl but if i go with my guild i always do RR, i have also done runs with all orbs reserved but then you only get the worst geard people wich is fine if im going with a good healer wich as a tank i have alot of haha
---
Hear hear. Big time rankers are usually very chill about it all, you won't last very long if every game is played as if everything is at stake.
---
Takes no effort to win 95% of the game, even if you have a shit group. Most premades would take turn throwing games against other premade anyway on big servers because otherwise game could go on for hour, and that's no good for honor.
---
Yeah I'm sure that has nothing to do with 2 puggable raids being all the content there is to do. I'm sure it's all because of reddits talking points.
---
All 50 of them
---
This thread is fully of people who are finding mental justifications for not being efficient at the game. You, for some reason (probably feeling inadequate for playing a game for “neckbeards/people you feel superior over” yet not being highly ranked or something), feel a constant need to assume that people who minmax are in someway miserable or mentally deficient. You just did the same thing with me - assuming 1. that I must be trolling for disagreeing with you and 2. There is something wrong with me.
---
When I said by week 5 or 6 we were at 3 hours for MC + Ony I got downvoted by all the people saying an average run should be around 1.5 to 2 hours.
---
Honestly on Ashbringer EU it feels like 80% of the horde is undead. With a few tauren warriors and shamans of different races sprinkled around.
---
If you only do your alt in there it'll be slower than if you invite 3 more lowbies. The lower average group level increases the xp gained by the lowbies. However, if any of them are too low that person gets nearly nothing. I guess within -5+3 levels is probably the best but I only did that in SM Cath up to now so it might change.
---
Yep
---
You've sold around 60,000-100,000 gold? I doubt that.
---
You want 5 players in the group. Exp is calculated by average players level. So by having 4 people that level appropriate you will get better exp, close to normal but at a much faster rate. 
---
Try to find some guildies or people in trade/lfg that want a free boost.
---
To be fair, MC trash is also harder than MC bosses. We have fewer deaths on rag than some trashpacks.
---
Haha nah man, dont play the "it was a joke card" the idiot here is you that has such a problem with people not agreeing with you. Pathetic
---
I did this recently with a 60 mage to level a warrior 1-40. Here's where I found optimal xp ranges
---
WC/DM 16-22
---
SFK/Stock 22-26
---
BFD 26-28
---
SM GY 28-35
---
SM Lib/arm 35-40
---
Hope this helps. Managed it in under 2 days /played
---
With MC, poly and shackle you may be able to 3-man strat live trash for dem sweet tasty orbs. I know 2 mages can do it. 
---
Dont forget to MC the battle mages - their damage is insane! 
---
For the undead trash packs stock up on holy waters, oil of immolation and grenades.
---
Wasn't there a mention somewhere in the rules that defunct private servers like Nostalrius are ok to mention?
---

---
A general rule of thumb is the mobs in the dungeon want to be mainly yellow/orange definitely NOT red to you for best xp gains
---
Of course that's the case (it's just you never get any horde who can be bothered, or some fool runs into aggro range and ruins it).
---
Not proof. Just a witch hunt.
---
Nice red herring.  Saying people in full greens are the same as people with 60% mounts.  You literally can’t compare the two, do you know why?  First of all, it’s a fallacy to compare two unlike things.  Secondly, BWL, like MC and omg, would be possible to do in greens.  In fact you just made my own point.
---
You would need to prove op knew it was a bot. He could just say he was playing with said hunter and prove it otherwise.
---
Our guild never survived a submerge phase. Only reason we killed rag is because it was pre submerge.
---
It's because the ban waves help and are easy to do where complaints add a name to a list instead of a person sitting there looking into every report. 
---
So the ban wave gives a couple weeks of no bots instead of forever with less bots.
---
Has to be different account
---
They do, it is just really hard to get them out of combat (they don't despawn in combat).  
---
The only times I have gotten them to despawn was when they had aggro on someone outside while I capped and that person ran out of their range after cap.
---
Raw gold + herbalism. If you just kill the lasher packs and herb efficiently, you can do 5 resets in 35 or so mins usually pick up ghost mushrooms, Dreamfoil, and gromsblood
---
I don't really see a point to leveling in Ret. I prefer holy or prot (even if using 2Her). You don't have many abilities, and Repentance isn't a damaging ability. It's a CC when you already have HoJ.
---
Compare that with getting Cons and Holy Shock. In addition to 10% Str and Imp SoR, in addition to 3% hit. Those would actually make a difference.
---
Actually not much experience. Too easy
---
Reserve orbs in Live Strath, DM:E jump runs, or herbalism.
---
Would Cone of Cold kiting just be slowing them with it and running around a circle at an angle waiting for it to come off cooldown?
---
Naw, I still love it
---
I think you posted this twice?
---
On the technic panel at blizzcon they said they have all patches 2.0+ so there is a good chance we get patch by patch tbc
---
witch hunt? what witch hunt? i have nothing personal against this guy, i don't really know him. i know what i (among others) saw in AV though, and is clear in the videos.
---
The reason I followed this sub is because I thought it would enhance my joy in classic. This sub is nothing but whining and crying. Jesus christ people, I didn't even know half the things that was wrong with the game untill i joined this sub.
---
This post is theast straw. Imma head out and just play the game. Jesus.
---
It actually just looks like a 15 year old game. In fact it is set on the same and newest engine retail has.
---
Sure am glad I have a guild to play with. All these people treating wow like a real life job are funny. God forbid you do a dungeon to help others.
---
I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time, and a I’m always working on it, but it’s something I know I will always be working on. But WoW has been great for me, I started when Classic was rereleased, and I think a big part of it is great guild members and such a great giving community. Shame people are not as thoughtful outside or WoW
---
F R E S H
---
Just mind your business Karen
---
Oh I just had a rogue take the stonespinr cloak from me. It's my bis tanking cloak. And a rogue took it. We're literally running strat so he has a chance at barons cape... And he takes my bis tanking cape... Off a rare mob... Boy was I livid.
---
Idk man, there are so many tiers of talents where you are taking nothing useful for questing when leveling as holy/prot.
---
AQ isn't coming soon, it will be released with phase 5.
---
This is amazing LOL. +1
---
Both shadowpanther and the spreadsheet have quick strike over don julio.
---
I had similar issues doing my mage. Practice obviously but also no blink if you can help it. What I do is this: group-&gt;FN rank 1-&gt;run until about 50% of FN timer left-&gt;blizzard-&gt;run 2 steps or so-&gt;blizzard-&gt;either reset with FN or finish with CoC. If I misjudge health arcane explosion.
---
I mean, that’s your opinion.
---
Read the comment chain you're commenting on. You got triggered because I said alliance have victim complexes and so you said i should switch to alliance for the welfare of the game, which makes no sense when my server is already balanced.
---
Just because your server sucks doesnt mean it's Horde's fault as a whole. Contrary to popular belief, there are plenty of PvP servers with decent faction balance. You all chose to play on those servers, and are the only ones responsible for that imbalance. Even then, can you really blame people for not wanting to throw away all of their progress and reroll in an incredibly time-consuming game just to appease you?
---
You can whine on reddit at people who probably don't play on your server and are completely irrelevant to your situation, or you can do something constructive like reaching out to the opposing faction on your server or suggesting ways for blizzard to fix the problem. I.e. faction changes, incentives for rerolling, etc.
---
No that's just fat
---
For expensive items you’re better off spamming trade chat to avoid deposits and the 5% ah fee anyway but I wouldn’t sweat it for stuff under 50g too much
---
Yep, that's exactly the trinket you're thinking of.
---
Aye, i would like to know that too, probably a weakaura script eh ? Can you share it with us fellow warriors ?
---
Can't unsee
---
If they’re not in combat and the bunker is capped, they despawn.
---
This isn't proof of botting at all. Simple explaination is the guy is just AFKing doing stuff around the house and returning to his PC every few minutes to pop a flare and autorun the other way.. 
---
You say he is a well known streamer? If so why would he do something so stupid as botting when it's so likely that he would be caught?
---
It does suck that people AFK in AV though.. a better afk detection system would be nice i suppose.
---
Everyone who is serious about PvE would just go horde for bloodlust.
---
Say it with me now:
---
"Just because you don't personally see a ban happen, does not mean they're not happening"
---
People botting in AV is his business though, because it's making the honor grind harder for everybody when people AV bot without getting punished.
---
And it's even more of a problem when streamers do it, because of the effect it has on (mostly younger) viewers watching and their attitudes towards cheating.
---
Now I didn't watch the video and I'm not going to, but let's not pretend cheating isn't everybody's problem.
---
Done all quests in Maraudon already, was planing to start doing BRD at lvl 52 (as a healer) if that is not too early
---
No shit
---
Are you making a point that i’m missing? If you don’t like it don’t play it - I don’t get people who come to a game that has been remade with a Vanilla mentality and demand changes.
---
Are you saying because its technically running off the Legion client we mayaswell add mechanics, balance classes and change the PvP system? If so I really disagree.
---
insane lore moment my ass. Burning Crusade is the point where the lore seriously took a nosedive,
---
5% spirit is negligible. Desperate prayer, fear ward and stone skin are op for pvp and pve
---
People who are depressed, primarily
---
Suppression room and broodlord are basically same area, but yeah the trash in bwl can be annoying but not bad enough to quit over xD
---
Acting like your reaction was some kind of joke when it clearly wasn’t is gringy af.
---
Sometimes it’s better to suck it up and accept stupid behavior instead of riding a dead horse because you can’t swallow your pride.
---
Grow up.
---
I play nightelf because it was my favorite Race in WC3, after playing horde in WC1 and 2 I aranged with the alliance. Oh, and female, because of the looks.
---
you can target him from the tunnel, just gotta be standing on the ledge
---
Uh, no, it's very easy to see if there's a screenshot or not.
---
Cuz bro ony mechanics are very hard after 15 years ok?
---
I'd sit on my 3s for safe glad and would grind Gladiator in 2s from a fresh team to 2350 in one day with other gladiators. No comparison.
---
Not sure I understand what you’re saying, but whatever makes you happy go for it!
---
Nope. But even the movement animation of shitty kodos don’t look as clunky and ugly as those crappy warlock mounts.
---
Totally agree, with the caveat that I don't care about BGs so the long queues on horde don't bother me. That said it's killing my guild and I fear we won't recover from it, there's been a ton of "let's start raiding in retail again, it has arenas and BGs without queues" talk, which makes me incredibly sad but it is what it is.
---
Solely for pve yes.
---
Sounds like you want a harder version of vanilla, not how it actually was back then. Think you're in the small minority on that one
---
It would be hard to list every single positive AND every single negative thing in a reddit post.
---
Is this a joke lol
---
But they need orbs? I was confused because you said they didnt need anything.
---
Yeah I tried doing it with 3 shammys. It’s slow as there not geared but I couldn’t see a reason to stay as gold was so low. How many characters is he running?
---
In the old days? are we now pretending your older than 15?
---
spare me
---
Go play them then.
---
Such a cute little pupper
---
Sunk cost fallacy. Leveling a new toon to 60 takes 5-7 days of /played time. 
---
If you're unhappy then reroll.
---
I tried that method and it didn't work. I was around 250-300 kills before it dropped. :)
---
Not sure which helm you mean. As far as I know the zooming helmets were only added with The Burning Crusade and they aren't in Classic.   
---
Only other thing that comes to my mind is the Gnomish Mind Control Cap and like /u/darker_ryoga saiad, that has absolutely nothing to do with Mind Vision.
---
Human and undead make up about 20-22% of a faction each, by a decent margin most popular.
---
How do you do that?
---
What is the best AoE/raiding spec on a mage?
---
From my experience, we made alts to clear Naxx, we also tried to min max Naxx runs. Our server was about 30% harder than real vanilla, so it was actually super hard to do 4HM and KT even in full T3 and world buffs.
---
No lag loooooooooool.  
---
Just can people stop saying no lag. Everything connected to the internet at all times lag.
---
WoD also had that pre-Legion event, you could get a new character to max level in less than a day.
---
Yes, but you don't call your mother in the middle of the night yelling about how bad of a fucking apple this orange is...
---
Capped on specials, but since Rogues can't exactly 'queue' heroic strikes (like Warrior's due to overwrite hit thresholds) extra hit isn't going to hurt you. The rest of it depends entirely on your gear composition and short of actually running the sims with your exact loadout there is no good answer.
---
Will never pay blizzard $15 for one account. Pservers are still out there and with some rise in population would no doubt be better than what blizzard is provided. Seek them out.
---
2.5 hr
---
Skull is very easy to fish for locks. Send in VW to attack the 3rd group. Run in to that group's depth, hug left, hit target macro. If he's not there, die, reset, repeat. His spawn chance is kinda low. I'd say 5-10%
---
Thank you all for this great info and I also joined the Classic Mage Discord.
---
Why ban him lmao this is just natural selection at work and the guy is just accelerating the process.
---
I thought I read somewhere that mentioning old servers like Nost is allowed? Can't find it in the rules now but I'm pretty sure I've seen it somewhere.
---
/r/im14andthisisdeep
---
So when I hit 9% hit, personally I went with eye of rend for the crit.  You don’t really need to go past 9% hit.
---
We've had a lot of debate about an item being 'BiS', since in many cases an item may be BiS for a particular scenario but not others (e.g. Mitigation gear for tanks, mp5 gear for healers), or an item may not be the absolute BiS because of a world drop item or rank 12+ item being better. Also it depends which list you follow as to which items are considered BiS, which also generates a lot of debate.
---
So with that, it came down to an item being BiS or near BiS, and if so, it would cost the maximum amount in our DKP system. There are some instances where an item may be considered BiS for a class, but they are still 2nd Prio. Examples would be Band of Accuria, or Brutality Blade/Core Hound Tooth for Hunters.
---
So it is the same person. Just a different account
---
I don't understand why people farm for Skul's wand instead of doing Scholo for Bonecreeper Stylus. +3 shadow spell damage just isn't worth +4 Intel and +8 dps, not to mention Gandling is *always* there.
---
wPvP isn't dead but thanks for trying.
---
+ fucking dots and hots
---
&gt;It's too streamlined.
---
It's more streamlined than vanilla, but nowhere near as much as modern retail.
---
&gt;Flying is still ruining the game.
---
The only thing it "ruins" is ganking out in the world.
---
&gt;Dungeon finder.
---
Nobody used it, especially not for heroics or pug raids. Also it still required you to talk to people. It's literally the same thing that vanilla has with meeting stones, just, you don't have to visit an inn to use it.
---
&gt;Boring ass dungeons.
---
No more boring than vanilla's endgame dungeons.
---
&gt;The zones are pretty but boring. Too much "eyy we're in space LUL".
---
"I have no valid complaint so I'm just going to call it boring over and over"
---
&gt;No world PvP.
---
Yes there was...? Multiple zones had wpvp objectives.
---
&gt;Cross faction capital (wtf???).
---
You mean like all the cross-faction hubs in vanilla?
---
&gt;Nerfed engineering.
---
It's still the best profession.
---
&gt;Weak class identity.
---
?
---
More subjective, vague whining.
---
&gt;More balanced my ass.
---
It literally is. Hybrid DPS/tanks are finally raid viable, while still having weaknesses. TBC's class balance directly fixes all of the biggest issues with vanilla's class balance.
---
&gt;Shamans/paladins on both factions is a big oof.
---
Why are people mad about this? I don't understand. Blizzard was balancing Paladin and Shaman to be equal to each other so that one faction didn't have a clear advantage over the other. Instead of balancing these two classes to make them the same, they just gave the classes to both factions. Would you rather they stay faction-exclusive and end up being the same class with different colors?
---
&gt;And if you can’t, go somewhere else, this isn’t the “I hate classic wow listen to me reeeeee” sub.
---
Many people want their game subreddits to be echo chambers of "this game is perfect". Unfortunately many subs are like this. Why is it a problem that some people have issues with the game?
---
You confuse complaining about something with "hating the game". It's either a dishonest or a lazy argument. The people who truly hate the game, or don't care at all about it anymore, are not posting or reading this sub anymore.
---
Yo ask around in your AV matches. A guildie mentioned a cross server Discord channel. He said everyone ques up and then moves into respective channels
---
Ah, another person that calls everyone they disagree with a "shill mod" or a "neckbeard." *Very* refreshing indeed.
---
Transparency is important in these situations. All blizz has to say is "Ban Wave Happened this last Pacth targeting &lt;insert offenses&gt;" and people will stop doubting that anything is being done. Maybe they've already done a wave, idk.
---
I can reset for Jed once or twice and I get locked out, and my groups tell me "oh you can't count I guess, must have reset 3-4 times." Nope, I reset twice actually because it's really fucking easy to count to 2.
---
Anyone have recommendations on how to not get locked out looking for him? UBRS is the only instance where I've ever seen this issue.
---

Your mom doesn't care how old I am.  :)
---
I won't claim to be very good at the game or anything, but I did do a little bit of mythic raiding in legion. Perhaps that  is why when I read up on the BWL mechanics I thought "is this it?" In the later raids and difficulties one person screwing up can wipe the entire raid and so people had to be paying attention. Compared to that stuff I think BWL will be fairly easy. I'll just have to wait and see.
---
Shattrath is the main hub that's what's wrong. 
---
And then there are the portals. That stuffs just straight out of a custom server's, run by 14 year olds, playbook.
---
It is his option but it also the opinion of Blizzard. In interviews, Blizzard devs have actually said that they wish they could take back flying. That is why in retail they have the pathfinder system which makes it so flying doesn't exist for the first 6-8 months of an expansion. Blizz can never go back to no flying cause when they tried in WoD people lost their shit. This was the best compromise they could come up with.
---
Don't lie to yourself man. Compare wpvp now to pre-bg, heck even pre-honor patch.
---
There are 110% bots in Azshara.
---
Neither does anyone else
---
Guess Allan was right, you people really didn't want Classic. Ah well.
---
And still no winterfall firewater
---
Sadly even on heartseeker horde are still doing it.... At 5 am no less...
---
Considering the games on 1.12 which was tuned/designed around naxx I'd say you'll be waiting a while for hard pve content and even then I dont think everyone will struggle.
---
Bloodlust isn't faction specific...
---
&gt; were able to provide a better Vanilla experience than what I’ve experienced in Classic.
---
You actually had game masters fixing obvious stuff like botting. I feel like Blizzard barely does anything against bots. 
---
&gt; You're comparing a bloody multi billion dollar company who owns the original game to a bunch of basement dwelling neckbeards. Yet, the latter group had fixed issues at a much faster rate, were more engaged with the community overall, and did more things right. Let that sink in.
---
It is often easier for this to do with a smaller group of people (surprisingly), as the organisational structure enables people to have more autonomy in their work. When someone from Blizzard would communicate it would need to be approved by some middle manager / community coordinator, checked for content, if content violates some plan it can't go through etc. I also doubt any Blizzard employee posting news or anything about classic gets rewarded for spending time on that, so they simply don't. Its bad for the customer since there is no interaction between the developers (or their thoughts / discussions). 
---
&gt; Maybe it's just me I don't know. Anyone else feels this way?
---
Yes, but I kind of expected it since I don't hold Blizzard in high regard after Wrath of the lich king anymore.
---
Literally this. I spend over a level during this quest. Helped alot with the absence of quests around that level.
---
But I looked up several sides if I was really killing the right opponent
---
Nah, it's not worth much. I sold mine on Gandling for 35 gold, was decent imo. 422 is downright insane lol.
---
You got all the way to 60 without buying your 60% mount? the fug
---
Yeah let's pretend Flying didn't do anything to wPvP. Yeah right. 
---
World PvP is fine now. The reason you don't see a lot of wPvP, right now, is because people are still grinding rep. Just wait till the rep grind is over.
---
I don’t agree. I don’t want everyone to say this game is perfect  I don’t think it’s perfect. I’m just happy I have access to it, and it’s still the best game I’ve played in 15 years, even with its flaws. 
---
What I’m tired of is the cry posts. If you follow this sub over the course of a work you’ll see the overwhelming reeeee, for the sake of ree.
---
Probably [the only non-elite mob that drops it.](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4494)
---
I was fishing in AV, and the players all reported me AFK.  I was removed from the battleground.
---
Two problems with this:  it’s a false positive in the data that blizzard has to make sense of as they try to address the bot problem.  They also had to spend time responding to the ticket I opened against the players that abused the report AFK feature.
---
At this point it's just fun to see how up in arms everyone is getting.  I love it.  It's only a stupid picture.
---
Lmao mate I sold one for 300 like 2 months ago when the economy was weak. You need to do some research my man
---
Op don't listen to this
---
Good game but pvp system is scuffed :/
---
Lol at comparing Priest with Shamans.
---
Not even close bro.
---
Yeah real fucking nice to just insult us like that. Some of us are 14.
---
The only thing imo that is going to be worse in TBC is faction imbalance. It’s already a problem and then when you add bloodelves and Paladins for Horde it gets wayyyy worse.
---
Oh, but for months you salty allies were saying a lot of “I told you so” about horde having to deal with queues when alliance complained about getting roflstomped in PvP, so it’s only fair that they lose all their games, I really have no sympathy for you guys cry more though
---
My family! My main is named Yourecute :D
---
stop being such a neckbeard. You know exactly what they mean. 
---
Get out of here with your akschually bullshit
---
There were mad amounts of bots in bfa. Blizzard doesn’t want to upset daddy China and get their pp slapped.
---
You seem like a dated rule.
---
This happened to me. Thankfully Only my neopets account got comprimised though 3 years after the fact (pure lazyness on my part to change the password) as it was the only account of mine that shared that password and it got frozen/banned for my protection as soon as they saw it wasnt me logging on as usual (different IPs?) So nothing was taken, no neopets pounded and I was already broke as shit. 
---
Bad part was that it took an extra year to get support to get off of their asses to recover my 10+ year old account after badgering them consistently on Facebook with my support ticket number. They didnt believe me that I was the real owner and demanded me to tell them *what my original email was that I signed up for neopets was in 2004.* an email thats now deleted and belonged to my father. I pretty much had to go on an older pc of mine to grab screencaps, provided all possible email addressed linked to the account, older even worse passwords I used as a kid previously and even list off all of my neopets I created on that account and transfered over to sides for the dipshit support to finally believe me and unban my account.
---
Tl;dr: Neopets is a fucking mess and a shell of its former self and a giant security risk. Its going to die in 2020 with Flash being killed off as 90% of the site and 99% of games run Flash.
---
It's elvui, it's just a redskin it works for me
---
I believe you're looking for "correlation is not causation"
---
I think he was getting trolled
---
Lookint at most gaming subs, and looking at this one as the rules relaxed, I think it's more 'many people want their gaming subs to put aside anything about the game, and focus on shitposts and memes'.
---
Meh I feel like you’re overestimating it’s value quite a bit.
---
are you out of your mind arthas
---
On horde, you could sell it for 250ish on my server. I can't see any reason why it would be worth much as alliance. Humans would be better off with sword spec proc offhand with higher dps/stats. I guess some non-optimized non-human edgemaster warrior could use it with deathbringer. They'd be better off being human though.
---
What about female nelf druids and human mages? Those are the only alliance that ever attack me on sight swear to god
---
I too took Phil 100 brother
---
&gt;So you think that the people arguing don't have merit in their complaints? You're equating talking about issues with "crying". That doesn't seem fair. You don't have the issues that other people have, so you choose not to understand them and reduce them to "crying".
---
Having read almost all of the posts on this subreddits recently, I definitely don't think it's unfair to characterize a bunch of it as crying.
---
Sadly as an alliance warlock, it feels like I only have death coil, everything else is useless against 90% of horde.
---
nonsense, Blizzard has a smaller support staff, that is true. But getting in contact with a GM aint hard at all. I doubt they interfere in stuff like this though, as generally Blizzard bans in waves.
---
That’s why I’m trying to price it for horde lol
---
I wonder why most people quit during AQ prepatch, while temple was actually difficult the ruins was easy and fun
---
You're forgetting another obvious solution: Fresh.
---
1k needle, stonetalon, hillsbrad, redridge, duskwood, barrens imo.
---
Usually start a twink until you have 2 accounts full of BiS geard chats. Most people stayed for the pvp though.
---
Just get ridd of fucking spellbatching and the ridiculous melee leeway. Both drive me insane in both PvP and pve.
---
Don't worry, I learned how to become a super leet PvPer like you and leveled a Rogue to 60 just to camp lowbies in Redridge and make life miserable for them. They can gtfo and play on PvE servers if they don't like it.
---
for example what about blastershot rifle? that's a pvp item. but I understand what you mean and the dkp cost of the item pretty much tells me whether or not it's bis. thank you again! how's your guild doing? ready for bwl?
---
&gt;I’m tired of seeing people shit all over it because “private server X did a better job
---
One thread today, some posts there and there since release. The people who hold that opinion also love WoW, but feel private servers did a better job at capturing its essence. How is that 'shit all over it'? 
---
'Hating', 'crying', 'shit all over it'. That's how you see people that hold a different opinion than yours. Reddit is definitely the right place for you.
---
Yeah it is, but it's the same as it's always been. People complaining about such a well known quantity makes no sense - the system is well known, opt in or out.
---
If there’s need for tanks or healers and its the last spot , orb reserved for that person to promote joining that grp.   This orb reserving has blown out of proportion.
---
Ashenvale and 1k Needles for sure
---
Pretty sure were
---
This guy fucks.
---
There is no haste
---
I was an advocate for a frankenpatch in which anything from patch 1.0 to 1.12. is fair game.
---
Seeing how we had 1.12. itemisation and talents set in stone, I hoped they would use unnerfed content to balance the powercreep which happened over the various patches. Many classes are pretty much twice as strong as they were when the game came out due to high +spell damage on gear and very strong talents that got added later on.
---
Pom pyro is gimmicky, elementalist build is good if you can chug lips.
---
Sell it 100 and take 80 - Mankrik US horde here and that seems to be the going rate
---
Look mate. If you wanna Argue with me about how I see things vs how others see it, while offering no opinion of your own, reddit is the place for you.
---
Look up 3 minute mage
---
People seem to forget that the reason people asked for Classic in the first place was so we wouldn't have to deal with pservers' bullshit.
---
This includes but is not limited to unjust bans from mods who don't really care, *constant* gold selling advertisements because it's a free server and anyone can join without any investment (which meant that when one gold seller got banned, two more popped up in its place), sudden server crashes (happened more than you might remember on Nostalrius), and the community which had its own flavor of toxicity at many points because, again, it's a free server where you can easily make another account. (though I did like that it didn't have quite as strong a feeling of minmaxing-ness that Classic has today. It certainly existed back them to an extent, but there was not nearly as many resources back then other than forum guides and some YouTube videos.)
---
Grats !

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't like when the sub of a game becomes just memes and art, but I definitely dislike to see any dissent to be driven of by forum rules, overzealous mods and insecure players (not the case of this sub).
---
And you think people would believe that?
---
Blizzard literally has a blue post full of bug fixes they have made for Classic, and yet, people on this sub are still screeching that "blizz isn't fixing anything, they're just letting classic rot so people switch to retail".
---
Maintaining a guild is a real challenge especially when you need a specific ratio of 40 players to even be considered relevant.
---
It felt like 50% of the server were Chinese just for everyone's information.
---
It is a bit dissapointing imho. I only seriously played tbc/wotlk and I just dinged near the end of vanilla and did some light pvp.
---
For me the main problem is that from my pure pve perspective there is nothing to do. The 5mans are easy, the raids are easy. When I first cleared Rag (the first day I dinged 60 in a guild doing its first full raid using dkp) I was sad because it was so easy. I think the only endgame thing that compares to my tbc/wotlk memories is doing 20man ony or 3man strat because it feels what I do actually matters. Every guild is 10/10 1/1 and has one raid day while in tbc/wotlk the casuals and the best guilds on the server had more raid days. Five raid days with minimum attendance of three per week was the standard, but now that would be entirely too much. I think a lot of these problems stem from classic having the reworked gear and talents.
---
If BWL is not fun and at least a bit difficult I am out.
---
What?
---
Honestly I am a dps and I encourage this behavior in tanks. They can't solo farm like I can. And they are helping me get an item I want.
---
After 10+KT kills the guild members stopped playing. The game was finished and the last bosses (4HM, Saph, KT) were time and mat consuming. Nobody wanted to farm that much for content that has been cleared regularly. However without preperation the bosses could not be killed (even with a BiS raid).
---
You asked for a price check
---
AV chat is the worst.
---
That sucks. I have catseye goggles+elixirs exactly to get rid of the rogues camping menethil from time to time.
---
It’s preraid bis, and I have the only one on my server atm so maybe a lil but I think I’ll have a good turnaround on a 40g investment
---
Dude... I hate you.
---
   
---
For the last nearly 2 weeks, for at least a few hours a day (7 hours a few days ago), I've been doing nothing but killing Scarlet Spellbinders. No drop. I've killed thousands of them.
---
"Breaking Brackets" is a community thing though, Blizzard should not police that ever. I'd rather see them act on botters destroying the economy. Those impact a lot more players than the top 0.5% players on a realm that are colluding amongst eachother to keep other players out of those brackets. 
---
I agree that bots in BG should be banned, but i don't agree its big enough to act out on immediatly, i would prefer Blizzard to wait till the day that the first rank 14's would come out, and then do a banwave that:
---
1. Bans players exploiting in PVP for a certain time period
---
2. Reset their rank to 0
---
3. remove all gear / items they got from ranking. 
---
And do this for every single player that botted, account shared or used any other exploit during the ranking proces.
---
On Kirtonos, and you didn’t actually say a price. It also has crusader on it which is a 70g enchant by itself..
---
422g would be a steal on horde Herod
---
Not in Tyr's Hand...
---
3 Times and already moaning? I got 2 level ups out of the quest pretty much farming uncontested.

I checked, must have been around 55 mins then, because our record is 37 minutes. I say our, but I wasn't even *in* the instance that night as I was supporting instead.
---
If it wasn't for all the undead trash in the way I would consider it.  But with that worthless trash included it seems easier/more profitable to just 2-man DME jump runs.
---
Winning isn't the objective of AV, killing as many lieutenants and commanders as possible or capture towers/bunkers if it's a turtle. Then just let the other side win.
---
wPVP in vanilla was one of the most casual, laidback, family-friendly version of wpvp compared to other MMOs back then.
---
Not salty, just hate when idiots comment on my shit
---
I know it’s just a WoW bot, but this whole human-like AI that everyone seems to want is absolutely terrifying to me lol
---
Ya I'd report you too. Don't fuckkkkking fish in PvP go sit in a capital
---
&gt;What I fail to understand is why icyveins is saying 1 crit is 32 attack power at level 60..
---
Yea that exactly is what is confusing me. So here is what I did. I took the base agility of a night elf hunter at lvl 60 and converted it to attack power. 
---
1 agi = 2 AP
---
So 130 * 2 = 260 AP
---
260 AP would then be the base amount on a night helf hunter at level 60. 
---
I then took 32 AP and divided it by the base AP which is 260
---
So 32 / 260 = 0.12 or 12%
---
According to this math, 32 AP is a 12% increase in attack power relative to the base attack power at level 60. 
---
1% crit being a 12% increase in attack power seems way off. 
---
This was just my way of figuring it out. I could very well be wrong. 
---

Meanwhile you can get to early 20s on Horde without even leaving the Barrens, which you have 3 FPs to easily get around.
---
Try mara for above 45-52 scepter required !
---
I agree that's portals were a huge convenience but Imagine if someone wanted to go to org from shatt without it. it's probably 30-40 minutes without it. there was No good solution.
---
With a fookin, pencil.
---
Not sure if arguing over word choice but tank is there to make money and only money.  Alternatively the group could just cough up gold and the tank would also gladly run and even pass on orbs if you make it worth it.
---
I'm challenging your beliefs, as you put them out in public. Feel free to challenge my opinions and beliefs when I do the same. There's nothing else to argue though, you will continue to belittle those who have grievances with the game and reduce it to "crying".
---
World PVP has calmed down a lot since BGs came out, at least on my server. But the areas posted above sound about right.
---
Totally agree with you 100%.
---
Gaming, not just Classic WoW, has just changed so much and instead of realizing how cool or good something is, some gamers tend to think they are entitled to "this and that" when in reality there is almost always something pretty special right in front of you.
---
I get it, everyone will never be completely happy, but man sometimes I look at forums on games (again, not just WoW) and I see the stuff they say. I just sit there in awe, thinking to myself, "Is it really that bad?" Most of the time it isn't. I also feel most people get too powerful behind a keyboard.
---
That all being said, enjoy what you have because we could not have it at all.
---
Same , i watch them pass by just like bimbos in the street.   Point and giggle.
---
Just go deep fire.  Combustion is underrated. You'll blow people up. Scorch is also much easier to get off than either fireball or frostbolt and has no travel animation if you're hiding or blending in.  Blast Wave is excellent control or part of a devastating burst combo with Fireblast.
---
I've never seen a solid line of players like the one in this possibly doctored screenshot.  The most I've ever seen jumping that back door was 2 at a time.  I've played both sides in AV, and before you get all bent out of shape (I guess it's too late) about the back door into the allies base, it is just as easy to run directly through the horde base to our aid station.    If you run straight in to the stormpike base solo, across the bridge, between the 2 camps of NPC's, and up to the flag, you'll be picked apart and at low health (if not dead) from the archers that have LOS on you starting at the bridge.  As an ally running in through the frostwolf base (again, I've done this many times on my ally warrior) you will catch 2 or 3 arrows from the towers and that's it - all the way to the aid station.  
---
As far as I'm concerned, the back door into stormpike base equalizes the ease at which a single ally player can run straight through the horde base completely unmolested until the flag NPC's at aid station.  If you try to run through the ally base like this, you will not survive.
---
Not much of a PvPer pesonally, but it's kinda funny to watch rogues hack away at my feral tank set, especially after I've been in resto gear just healing the duelers and they challenge me not knowing I'm feral.  Gets absolutely melted by anything other than rogue/warrior though.
---
52 is fine for first part.
---
is there an alternative to reddit with decent traffic?  not just for wow but in general.  I always hear about 4chan but not in a good way
---
TBC is literally free money. They have everything backed up from TBC they've said and they've already done all the technical stuff to make the old game playable in the new engine.
---
I'd very much prefer classic+ but TBC feels more likely since it would be very little effort.  I'd love a TBC with no flying mounts however, not that that will ever happen.
---
Agreed! I asked a serious question about enhancement shamans and immediately was under fire by someone saying I was a piece of shit and lazy and that I didn't want to try because I didn't play Resto.
---
I was like "oooohkkkay? I figured I could play what I wanted, not what you wanted."
---
I had a good laugh.
---
Exactly: it SHOULD go to whoever is going to use it. But in a pug you all roll need cause you don't know if someone is gear switching or just going to straight up ninja; everyone is forced to need in order to protect themselves.
---
What game subreddits are echo chambers of “its perfect “?
---
Pretty much every game subreddit I’ve seen that’s used regularly is much more populated with whinging and complaining, because reddit has become the unofficial official forum for a lot of games so if you want the devs to listen to you and make changes (they won’t) this is where you whine
---
I had great fun PvPing with a fire raid spec in Vanilla. It puts a strain on the enemy team in a way that only a Shadow Priest can as you are either deleting your chosen opponent from life or, at the least, putting great strain on their healers by demanding exclusive attention.
---
I can't speak to how well it functions in higher level PvP against premades but it worked very well in general PvP against the general player base. You are the epitome of a glass cannon as the single most vulnerable and probably also the most destructive player on the field. I'd only recommend trying this to someone who has a sniper mentality. Someone who enjoys trying to find safe places from which to turret. Once you get good at it you can not only single handedly determine the results of entire battles but you can do so regularly.
---
If you aren't having fun in classic wow it's because you are a boring and unfun person
---
thats true, but if you go 1-40 you are kinda stuck and mabye bored to make a alt :P Many doesnt enjoy all the leveling.
---
SquadW, Nukky died for those furbolgs lol
---
I did, first ban was 7 days. 2nd Ban was 3 days. 3rd ban was 24 hours. Never got banned again after that despite me keep botting.
---
Blastershot we originally had as a PvP item so was just 1 DKP, but the Warrior discord updated their BiS list and BSL was then listed as BiS due to Human warriors only wanting 6% Hit, so Striker's Mark wasn't needed so much. We would still prio it to a Warrior or rogue over a hunter however. Even for PvP since hunters have better options from dungeons/quests.
---
I'd like to clarify that this build is only viable in PvP and extremely subpar in PvE content.
---
Super hyped for BWL!
---
Go herbalism for money making, you can also have an alchemist friend make potions for raids with the herbs you farm
---
That's definitely not an issue since most of the current AV games is 20 alliance vs 40 horde.
---
I have to agree with this one.
---
Those mobs stopped working in classic. That info is outdated.
---
While it's not haste in the retail sense, troll racial is :
---
 Berserking — Increases your casting and attack speed by 10 to 30%, depending on your current health. The lower your health is, the higher the increase. This lasts 10 seconds and have a 3-minute cooldown.
---
False
---
No guild had 5 raid days to do Naxx and Malygos when wotlk was released.
---
And ofc killing Moroes was more satisfying for you, because that was your first raid accomplishment ever. Now you’ve run thousands of raids returning to the introduction to raiding will never feel like an accomplishment.
---
You would feel just the same if Blizzard had given us 1.4 talents and gear, because ultimately Molten Core is Raiding 101 (don’t stand in the fire, kill adds first, etc ...) and from the sounds of your five day raid week you’re up to raiding 743
---
Anyone that came into classic expecting the PVE content to pose a significant challenge was in for an awakening, and I expect you’ll find TBC and most of wotlk to be similarly limp when it comes to providing a hardcore raiding challenge.
---
The joy of classic wow is not in challenging raid content, it’s a sandbox for you to find your own challenges and thrills. BWL speed running is fun (more so than speed running MC)
---
This is correct. Horde has the gy a bit furthur away but you can run in with no issues. If you're not a stealth you will die simply running into the ally base as horde. They even have the wandering commander who sees you a mile away in stealth so ridiculous. These people simply have no experience in AV and can't see the benefits on their end, they just want to complain.
---
You were under the wrong assumptions then, we all knew what we were getting. That's still like 300+ hours of playtime for 1 character, not sure how much more you wanted within the first few months
---
My guild did it in 25 minutes dude. But they did it while I was getting a happy ending from a Thai massage of course.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNI3OPAUUIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNI3OPAUUIY)
---
None on the horde AH right now on Kirtonos.  This is my tooltip from TSM/Auctionator: https://imgur.com/WwcAeKH
---
Hahaha I’ll take that on board
---
Because the backdoor jump is tricky, especally if you don't have an epic mount. While this route is just run to the wall and tap space a few times.
---
White damage is MOST of rogue dps. I definitely notice a difference when I'm wearing my dire maul 2% hit fire resist trinket (which puts me at 11%). I'm curious what 16% would like like for dps.
---
You can doubt it all you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that people got pissed when they tried to completely remove it.
---
Classic+ would be nice. After naxx there is no content so guilds will quit after few clears. Last great expansion was wotlk so i don't have much hype for new exp (still buy it like every exp so far and quit after realising it's worse than previous). Tbc is also good option but the classic should also stay playable.
---
Mage frost is so brain dead and so powerfull honestly I wouldnt bother with fire. As fire you can delete someone every 3mn, with luck, but you have almost no survival tools.
---
Smaller subreddits are better.
---
Healing priest means I can die to a single ambush or get stunlocked unfortunately
---
Elementalist build is tons of fun
---
It was added because horde were way under played.
---
Just checked for you. Joined specific AV in EU and got a invite to that specific AV.
---
Just mentioning loatheb as an example: one clean Kill will require 40x3 greater shadowprot pots, which is 480 fadeleaf and 480 grave moss. 
---
Not counting progression/wipes.
---
You will need dedicated members Who keep farming/buying consumables. Raidloggers wont make it.
---
But it was not just me. The majority of casual guilds were not clearing the earliest tiers as fast as we are doing with classic now. Like a bazzilion guilds were stuck mid SSC/TK and in Ulduar hardmodes. And even the first tiers were harder.
---
No, you are. You land in STV from Duskwood. You still have to run around the entire STV on foot or ground mount encountering players and mobs all around while you quest or level mining. The flightpaths also doesn't take you straight to an instance portal, you still have to run to it.
---
Not to mention the flightpaths aren't optimal, they take the scenic route, flying from Darkshore to Winterspring on a flying mount takes like a minute, on a flightpath it takes like 6 - 7 since it flies down through Ashenvale and then up through Felwood or something.
---
Like if you think just a little here there is no way the two or even remotely comparable.
---
He farms on his mage while playing AV. He honestly plays really well with 2 characters, he rarely misses inputs it at all and he can split his attention really well. (He levelled 5 accounts at the same time grinding dungeons just for the practice tanking)
---
Wow, your lack of self-awareness is truly astonishing. 
---
The op was complaining about the tone of people’s comments. 
---
You pop in with a comment making this all about you. 
---
You take this shit so personally when no one gives a fuck about you or your balanced server. It’s not part of the conversation. 
---
Your ego is so wrapped up in this game that you basically told the sub your feelings get hurt when a random person calls a completely different group of Random people names because you’re a member of that faction.
---
You’re pulling a “Not-all-Horde” here.
---
And no one is triggered.
---
This isn’t causing me ptsd. 
---
Again. This isn’t about you.
---
Well they’re handing in the same exact work as 15yrs a go except worse sooo seems fair to me
---
Yeah fuck me for expecting more than free loot content I guess.
---
Everybody’s got a little nerd in them :)
---
Get in on the action.  Your mom knows the truth :P
---
&gt; I also find it sort of creepy that you can't mention private servers, it feels pretty dystopian to be watching your words that carefully in a gaming subreddit.
---
Except that it's illegal in most countries? I can't imagine any gaming subreddit permitting widespread discussion of theft of the very game the sub revolves around.
---
Haha your mom upvotes to the left comedy 100
---
But private servers ran on the original 1.12.1 client and maps, so private servers should be 100% accurate in that regard, the only outlier could be doors/walls that are scripted.
---
and I am 100% sure this did not work in vanilla either, as I've never heard or seen it prior to classic. The backdoor jump path was known, this one was not. And this one has  a huge effect on AV since its so easy to pull off.
---
And it doesn't even involve dicks. Amazing. /s
---
&gt;head's up.
---
The sub community is always good for a heads up.
---
I'll delete it after I'm through having fun.
---
Same as Pandaren actually!
---
&gt;the only thing is, it would be cake walk to anyone who raided past LFR in retail of any sort I think.
---
The thing is, there are plenty of people who can't even get past LFR in retail. Hopefully they didn't end up trying to raid in Classic but you never know.
---
As someone who's done that jump many times you're just doing it wrong.
---
With 305 weapon skill, you need 6% hit to cap your specials anyway. At 310, you're only gaining an extra 0.2 hit (as well as the same amount of crit, and dodge/parry negation), so you still need 6% hit to cap specials. You could even consider swapping out your Mugger's Belt (or ACLG) for some other piece of gear.
---
That really didn't make any sense...
---
They were indeed nerfed. Just look how they butchered Scholomance and Stratholme.
---
Tons since I usually could only play on the weekends due to work.

All classes can easily solo cap the alliance base, and it happens in literally every AV to force a defense.
---
I have no idea how you know they're bots if they literally just afk in the cave.
---
If we choose it.
---
Yeah im guessing they don't want to thin out the playerbase but they kinda have to imo. It would be a misstanke to release TBC and not offer fresh vanilla servers at the same time.
---
But from a financial perspective TBC just makes sense since it would require very little effort, it's not what I'm hoping for but it just seems logical.
---
"no u"
---
Good counterargument.
---
This is true too, but didn't the population die out once they did all of the raids up to Naxx? They got bored just as much it seemed. IDK because I never did them.
---
I've done it.  I do the jumping back door in 75% of the AV's I do, and I often see 1 or 2 people doing this one while I'm doing the jump.  It's not an exploit, and the jump that I use to get the same job done is certainly not an exploit.  If blizzard was to patch them out, it wouldn't change much about how we play AV.  We would adapt, and you'd find something else to complain about.
---
Soon*tm
---
I would get locked out if I manually reset right after dropping group. Dropping the group automatically causes a reset.
---
So I leveled up my enchanting while I was leveling pretty much only to get the Smoking Heart of the Mountain Trinket. I was always hurting for gold. That's enchanting in a nutshell.
---
But honestly, you're a mage. Just stick with it until you level it up and get what you need, then drop it after if you don't want it. You're a mage. You are THE best gold making class. You may be hurting for gold now, but you won't for very long.
---
Ahem, fire spec has at least 2 buttons
---
I agree with you, but good luck convincing hunters not to roll on upgrades with that logic.
---
What a sight for sore eyes. Your positivity has refreshed me. For that...i thank you.
---
Any class can do the same to frostwolf aid station by running directly through the base.
---
&gt;I've done it. I do the jumping back door in 75% of the AV's I do, and I often see 1 or 2 people doing this one while I'm doing the jump. It's not an exploit, and the jump that I use to get the same job done is certainly not an exploit.
---
The jump is more difficult, and means that you probably won't get a huge number of hordes into the base in less than 2 seconds. Its easier to defend, its easier to spot and its hard to pull off without epic mount.
---
&gt;We would adapt, and you'd find something else to complain about.
---
You would have to cross the bridge, and that way alone alliance would be much more viable in pug AVs since defending the base would be possible without needing 10 people.
---
&gt; All blizz has to say is "Ban Wave Happened this last Pacth targeting &lt;insert offenses&gt;" and people will stop doubting that anything is being done.
---
Blizz has already stated that they want to prevent the bot-coders from discovering their methods for bot-detection (and thus, building around them) so that's why they don't announce these things.
---
Shadowlands is the reason.  
---
The number of people who quit because botters is infinitely lower than the number of botters.  Blizzard is a corporation, fuck capitalism
---
&gt;But private servers 
---
The truth comes out.
---
lmfao this was in Punkrat's video. Love it.
---
It's simple. That's why it's great.
---
I also like Paladins mount for the same reason. Simple enough to know exactly what it is: a noble steed.
---
I am not even a vanilla fan boy (tbc/wrath are my flavors) - but i have loved classic. It does not feel the same as vanilla which i was salty about to start, but at the end of the day its been an amazing trip. Lots of drama, lots of exciting moments. The tears on forums and reddit over everything blizzard does. Everything. 
---
I am just waiting for bwl at this point but im excited to see where this goes at this point.
---
Must be me then ;)
---
ever hear of in-house account sharing. Its a real thing, and some people do it. EX. Husband anf wife share a PC, work opposite schedules and play wow. This isn't uncommon on my server

I sure as hell feel like that too. I was expecting Vanilla, but I got Classic. Maybe it's on me.
---
I just wish we'd have had actual Vanilla. The excuse everyone always gives when this issue is raised is "b-but that was the earliest version they had saved !" ... so what ? Surely they can just watch old vids, read old discussions, find old data and recreate the early versions from scratch ?
---
Obviously they just wanted easy money. There's no better explanation. It's not lack of ability, it's lack of will.
---
Tbh this is one reason I like playing on a try hard sweat server. I see the same people at farm spots everyday and I know they are all players because we all communicate.
---
You shouldn’t need to flask but you can probably get away with 100g a week for major mana pots and some protection pots while AFK farming felwood Saturday for runes. You may need more than that if your guild is wiping a lot or you choose to flask. In MC in farm status I use like 10-20g in consumes per raid since I’m using weaker mana pots for farm bosses.
---
Grow his neckbeard, polish his tinfoil hat, work on his diabetes and keep evolving further into his egocentric douchebag-personality. Im fairly sure this guys dislikes people because nobody likes him.
---
and banishes! I don't think there's anything to banish in BWL.
---
I was thinking that the build you showed (with both nightfall and soul link) implied being level 60 already. I had a lot of +shadow damage even before lvl 60 so Ruin (and Shadowburn) + SM or DS felt much better than soul link. That being said I was drain tanking with succubus + demo talents pre-60 as well, but as soon as I respecced DS Ruin I dealt a lot more dmg in instances (and shadowburn is an extremely satisfying spell to use).
---
The wowservers subreddit was just terrible
---
Right but those guys actually play, we have 30+ vids of us snowballing the same 8 people from a guild out of portals constantly.
---
It's pretty much bis for prot paladin

Does Threatplates work as a full aggro meter?

I've been looking for one, however it looks like they don't work unless everyone has one.
---
AHHH That is different, id be getting in contact with live support and asking :) Not that they may be able to do much!
---
If anything you were the one "abusing",not the ones who reported you.

Reverse psychology always works.

Helped me get my HoJ on my last run before I was about to give up

At 43 get executioners axe. You'll continue to crush it.
---
&gt;As for the post linked in the op, we as a team don't approve of any currently ongoing private server projects and don't want them advertised on the sub. 
---
Can you explain this a bit more? Why is that? I'm having a hard time understanding how this affects current mods it members and I for one don't even know if any currently ongoing private servers but banning speaking about them doesn't seem to make sense. 
---
You don't go to an iPhone sub and as soon as somebody mentions Android the ban hammer starts flying around, that just doesn't make any sense when they are in direct competition.
---
Send in vw, gib one, run out. I used about 30 shards. The first and last pulls are the hardest, but skul himself resets coming out of his room, so you can fight him alone after trash is dead
---
Go female troll they arent hunchbacked for whatever reason
---
What are you struggling with on rag?
---
You reallllly want a tank to be fire res capped, 315 with buffs. That's 235 from armor and 60 from pally/shaman buff and 20 from Mark of the wild. That will make a huge difference depending on where you are at now. Moving from 200 to 300 essentially halves the damage taken and makes the tank healing very chill
---
Yeah the same guild who were never pushing hard for the first 6 weeks or anywhere close to top honor, 8 of them decide to farm all night out of no where. They sit afk at the AV portal for 10 hours straight, and just afk in the game in the cave. They are obviously botting since they literally never move.
---
this is for people who can't get to the door
---
Server is dreadmist EU, also reported the cheaters ofcourse
---
I agree, this guy is misremembering private servers or never played it
---
i have come to learn that pvp is so trash that even legion was better (and that was horrible)
---
it really ruins the experience for me.
---
For the first part, if i understand correctly, you can turn on enemy nameplates to see their HP bar without having them targeted. Turn them on with CTRL+V (default keybind). The second part requires an addon: RealMobHealth.
---
Yeah but why? No fun whatsoever involved for me in one tapping a lowbie walking by. In fact, it makes me feel like an asshole, which is why I don't do it.
---
PvP server, don't like it leave
---
From an RP perspective, I absolutely love the idea of a Gnome Rogue.
---
This is my thought as well. As others have pointed out in the past, while TBC(and ultimately) WoTLK would offer blizz the most short term financial incentive, it would split the playerbase and longer-term is a deathknell for the game. 
---
I'm really hoping that's not the path they go down, but knowing shareholders it will be. I'm just glad we got to have a vanilla-ish experience with the beginning of classic.
---
It is both good and fun, you can pump some pretty gnarly damage and still decent cc especially if elementalist. Frost is probably still better for high-end wsg premades (better peels and survival for helping the fc or running), but fire is still perfectly viable 
---
would recommend either doing elemental (can do blast wave or an ignite barrier one) or 21/30 arc/fire, which imo is way more consistent than AP pyro. POM is miles better than combust, that extra burst or a clutch insta sheep will save you in some gnarly situations
---
This isn't even true. When I started in 04 my sub fee wasn't $15, I think it was $11,90
---
Good thing it isn't science in the first place then.
---
do i get same amount of rep with warsong outrides per win/lose regradless if i am 19 or 60 ?
---
is it same with honor ?
---
Hahahahaha I just bought my epic so I gotta flip this I’m down to 400g atm
---
Exactly it was insane.
---
You are mage farm dme lashers or zf zombies.
---
More g/h and no competition
---
You still managed to find it though I’m impressed
---
r/gatekeeping
---
We've had "wow this game is so great" posts since it came out. We all think it's fun, that's why we're here.
---
how much is the recipe going for on your server?
---
&gt; And is it really theft? I had no other way of playing Classic except illegally because it didn't actually exist as a market product
---
You're right, it's not legally considered theft but rather a charge of [disgorged profits](https://www.geek.com/games/blizzard-wins-88-million-from-scapegaming-over-illegal-wow-servers-1277800/) (charge applied to the server creator) as well as a personal "void of license".
---
"Blizzard may suspend or revoke your license to use the Platform, or parts, components and/or single features thereof, if you violate, or assist others in violating, the license limitations set forth below. You agree that you will not, in whole or in part or under any circumstances, do the following:
---
Unauthorized Connections: Facilitate, create or maintain any unauthorized connection to the Platform including without limitation (i) any connection to any unauthorized server that emulates, or attempts to emulate, the Platform; and (ii) any connection using third-party programs or tools not expressly authorized by Blizzard."
---
So Blizzard has gone after Vanilla servers in the past because, even though retail is very different, the two games are still too similar.
---
I mean fuck you for playing Vanilla and then being disappointed with Vanilla, I guess..? All the stuff you're describing cropped up in pretty much every explanation of the game. It was said months in advance that MC would be the first raid tier for a while.
---
Idk what to tell you, quit if you don't like it.
---
While I 100% think you should play what you want (it's your sub money after all) and thay anyone trying to bully you into doing otherwise is an idiot, I also think the other extreme is equally bad. The other extreme being trying to bully people into accepting anything in their groups because 'play what you want'.
---
TBC was absolutely the best.  It was downhill after that.  
---
Bring on TBC after Naxx
---
It ends when TBC comes out
---
I didn’t attack anything, I said I like the game and I was tired of all the anti classic sentiment in this sub. I’m not gonna argue with you, as that’s not why I made this post. If you want to be angry and support the posts that tear down the game we love, you can. I’m just saying I’m over seeing those posts
---
How would you get to the bottom of something like that? How'd you trace the infection to a flash based ad on a specific site?
---
Ya but your logic on needing for an alt is invalid.
---
The flaw with your argument is the map was balanced around horde starting further up and the ally having a harder base to breach. Eventually hordes spawn position got moved back, but no so in 1.12.1. One non stealthie also gets blown up when trying to get to the relief hut. I don't know what bias you are trying to dictate on your ally warrior, but unless you were with other people, the archers have range on you all the way to the relief hut. With this skip, the horde hardly get touched with free access to the GY. 
---
Basically, as it stands, horde have all the pros and none of the cons where Alliance have all of the cons and none of the pros. Also, this skip makes it so the ally don't have a legit choke hold to defend, where the horde have at least 2.
---
Agreed, I didn't even know this item existed but now I'm gonna use it all the time.
---
Sound like half the losers on this sub get a fkin job
---
Exactly... no haste, just a cooldown
---
I think it depends on what you want.
---
There are a lot of classic players who avoided pservers solely because the idea of losing your character and having to start over unpalatable. 
---
The first time a fresh server comes out those players are probably done with classic. 
---
It is not a small population of the playerbase.
---
I just did it the way I described because you have to die anyway and it made me feel sure I was far enough in, I couldn't get a target without getting aggro standing on th ledge.
---
It seemed to be right past the first torch
---
You proposed a possible way to test for a hypothesis. That's the scientific method at work. Only your test is terrible because it involves completely separate systems from what the hypothesis does.
---
Youre assuming the only goal somebody might have in playing AV is to farm honor as efficiently as possible.  Some players are more casual than others, and dont know the most efficient strategies.  Some players do not like to percieve that they let the other team win.  Some players might just be doing it to screw over players like yourself.  Maybe some players just want to pvp.  You cant pretend AV is a bubble where the social aspects of the game do not exist.
---
Boring dungeons? What does Classic have, exhilerating ones?
---
Boring zones? What does Classic have, exhilerating ones?
---
No world pvp? Just...what?
---
More balanced your ass? Just..... Ok you're trolling.
---
You're confusing "anti-classic" sentiment with "anti-dev/blizzard" sentiment. People are upset with the way the game is being handled, not the game itself.
---
Phase 2 was a stupid idea to begin with and lasted way, way too long. It should have been cut short and Phase 3 should have been dropped early.
---
Not enough cheaters/botters/scripters are being banned. Which given the honour system of the game fucks with legit honour grinders when people can afk/bot and get just as much.
---
That's pretty much... it. Neither of those things have to do with hating classic. Just disappointed with the devs.
---
Same here, love to listen to Defcamp, Kargoz and You nerding bout wow!
---
You still haven't read the part of my comment where I said that an ally can run straight in through the horde base, and solo cap the aid station without any problem.  If you tried to do this as a horde player - running across the bridge, you will die to the NPC archers alone.
---
Seal of judgement prevents enemies from fleeing
---
Isn't that the assclown that ninja'd the Staff of Dominance?
---
Cut the tail brother, cut that tail...  haha
---
Not important enough to hire people to police. It’s just classic honor grind.
---
I’m just saying I like the game.
---
Very nicely done
---
At one point, queues were bound to your account rather than your character, so it was possible to enter the 10-19 bracket on a 60
---
Priests with decent gear can do DM:East lasher farm by spamming holy nova. There was a decent post about it yesterday. It requires you have herbalism though, which is always a great profession to have it you just want to make gold.
---
Yea before I went shadow, my strat in mc was to stay light on the heals and let other healers "race" their mana pools down and I'll be the guy with more mana to carry some of the weight if shit hits the fan and some people are near oom
---
Wtf this is not the backdoor AV I’m used to
---
Thats cool, I'm merely refuting 'pvp server means pvp' point. Its griefing if they can't fight back, simple
---
Do you mean you're on a private server?
---
Yes they absolutely can.
---
Nagelring + ret aura + essence of the pure flame + shield spike + Blessing of Sanc + consecration + a shield with native thorns
---
It's pretty damn good. The only issues you will have are when you are dealing with casters.
---
&gt; But can mentioning private servers, especially by their name, somehow be considered sharing the use of private servers, or is it considered encouraging the use of them, even if it's just referencing them in a proper context? 
---
Well, it pretty much is. Saying something along the lines like "Blizzard can't fix shit, private server XYZ did this so much better and even did \*that\* and \*this\*" is advertising and encouraging players to use this private server since it seems to be so much better.   
---
It does not really apply to closed servers though, but could still be seen as advertisement in my eyes.
---
How the heck do you have two sixties I’m barely level 49 on my main
---
Just press V not control-V?
---
Yeah I think they skip all the way to unforgiven with invis pots then clear a few packs the  invis again to humans. Small investment for massive time skip
---
that isn't turtling, that is when they take SHGY and wipe you at galv then push you from SH all the way to your base, and the only loss i've had in the last few days was from a premade, the other premade we did turtle and win (even though it was an hour) the HK's and honour earned made up quite a bit (for alliance it would be like 5 games + worth)
---
I'm having an absolute blast with my friend group - This game is the most rewarding game I've ever played.  
---
Sure there are a few QoL things I'd like, but the game is fantastic as is, for all it's shortcomings it's given multitudes more enjoyment.
---
It's weird, because in my experience we end up picking off enough alliance that they trickle into the base and get wiped and have to start over from SH, meanwhile the horde has capped or almost capped IW and SH bunkers with some people running north to ninja the DB bunkers.  
---
    
---
Also it's in our best interest to have \~20 minute games  seeing how our queues are that long to begin with.
---
Whats a more profitable profession? Enchanting?
---
That was amazing. Nice job.
---
There is :)
---
What's important to understand with the private server scene especially later part of the decade was the "fresh" craze, people don't stick around for servers instead they were hypeslaves joining whatever fresh server launched, played there for a month or three and then on to the next.
---
So what happened was around the time of the War Effort you generally only had established players and guilds around, with some new blood trickling in, and once Naxx was over and done it was on to the next server.
---
Lol, I did say "in the back" but I've seen it with melee too. "The logs are saying that you cast sinister strike 32 time in a row... and nothing else. Maybe throw a Slice or Dice or two in there next time."
---
As 19 horde twink I did
---
Westfall, Dustwood, Redridge, Strangethorn, Elwyn, Hillsbrad, Arathi, Wetlands, Dun Morog, Ashenvale, Barrens, 1k Needles, Stonetalon.
---
Might be an overkill.
---
I don’t care what anyone calls themselves in this game. In fact, I don’t really care what anyone does. It doesn’t affect me at all, so why should I care? Telling someone who is excited about their name that the name is dumb and doesn’t fit in a fantasy MMO is the definition of gatekeeping. You even gave a fucking list of “acceptable” names. You saw this post and was offended to the point that you had to comment. Insanity
---
Presumably after waiting for 5 days first?
---
Thank you for the transparency, it is hugely appreciated!
---
Details damage meter plugin Tiny Threat seems to be the go to.
---
so allies have the defensive advantage BUT also win in a straight zerg so you have the offensive advantage? So why is the backdoor a problem then if alliance have all the advantages since initial start position doesn't prevent them from winning before horde can even if it is further back.
---
&gt;But getting in contact with a GM aint hard at all. 
---
I've had 5 days wait time minimum. Not "hard" per se, but I wouldn't call them easy to reach.
---
What does it matter what happens with it? You just agree’d to everyone needing valuable things. Why does it matter if I use it or sell it. Your argument imploded on itself.
---
They’re not happening.
---
I enjoy rogues wayyy too much haha. 49 is no slouch though
---
congrats fellow warlock! got my level 60 also in LBRS right after the spiders :)
---
For me AQ patch is actually quite interesting. The whole rep grind thing is quite cool but the rep grind is also really long. 
---
I think it might be because the whole insect thing is kinda weird but IDK.
---
BG's are totally ruined by twinks, not even worth bothering with.
---
I relate strongly to the “addicted as fuck” sentiment
---
Ally can run straight to vann with barely fighting any guards.
---
This is simply leveling the playing field, what are you on about?
---
It's keeping me and several others from even bothering with PvP ranking. I'm staying around for the PvE though (waiting for BWL), so I guess in my case it's irrelevant.
---
Yea alliance had heroism, the exact same thing as bloodlust.
---
Wow... Shut up. You are wrong, no need to be so toxic about it. I was just trying to help :) Kinda hurts to not see my efforts bear fruit though... Unlucky.
---
Ty
---
Right-side clip is 1.12.1 stock client (same as vanilla, Nost, etc) on local private, left-side clip is modern 1.13.3 on Classic.
---
I believe real mob health has to calculate (read: estimate) the health on each type of mob before it correctly shows on every mob of that type. I can see that working not so well with enemy players as they all have different health.
---
If you are hard enough to kill Hundred of them you can make silver from just looting, meat dont sell at high price but they do loot a lot of grey and green, the best is if your lucky and get your hand to a Golden Pearl.
---
Where do people get the idea that MC is too easy haha... There are still pugs and even guilds who are struggling to down Ragnoros... I think the current level of difficulty is fine... If you are in a group of people who are committed to knowing mechanics and having half-decent gear, you can do the content... None of this old vanilla nonsense where you would need multiple runs worth of MC gear to do Domo/Rag ;)
---
The game isn't too easy... Many people just take it too seriously :D
---
Play Priest. Every raid team will want you either for healing or filling a fringe shadow spec role if you’re top notch. You won’t be tanking ever, but let’s face it...neither does a pally lol. Priest is an excellent pvp class and although the leveling may be slow at start, you can heal your way from 50-60 pretty quick. No competition unless your friends/guild are desperate for a paladin.
---
It's really not that bad if raiding is your main goal. Consider the time the average person spends in dungeons a week, then consider that hardcore raiders have no need for them. You can easily farm the mats/gold for your weekly raid consumables in the time you normally would be grouped up.
---
Op here : No.
---
Also increases queue time when the finite number of AV battlegrounds are in use
---
Yeah the best pre raid cape I want is that stonespire one. Was definitely shitty that rogue took it. Seeing as how were literally running a dungeon that gives him his BIS off a boss. Mine Is off a rare mob.
---
23 mins in wsg queue, on a Saturday, only a couple weeks after release to lose the majority of them as horde - is this supposed to be a enjoyable aspect of the game? Why is PvP hot garbage?
---
F\*ck didnt try to exchange wile in group -\_- but would have make me target of mods i think ...
---
Lol stalagg is way to sweaty for 400k 500 standin.
---
Yep, I get flamed a lot whenever I say that I min-max because I think it's fun, because apparently I have "No reason to do so in a 15-year old game" and "It's not reason enough to not allow memespecs in your raid" and "It's not fun min-maxing in a 15 year old game". I've got no clue as to why they think that they can decide what I think is fun to do in the game. It's actually shocking how commonly you get replies like this. I just want to play the game however I feel like, and I don't want to get flamed for doing it.
---
Toi même tu sais, farmer les bots c'est mérité !
---
Funny story... while they are technically BoE, I spent 3 days searching for somebody who could make it but got no response lmao xD. In the end I had to learn LW and get the recipe myself... :)
---
wPvP is not and never was a central part of the game and the people that continue to say this and repeat it constantly are projecting their own desires onto other people.  No one gives a shit about the lack of wPvP except for those who miss not being able to gank people who were unprepared. 
---
Saying BGs ruined the game because they reduced the likelihood of another very minor part of the game is a real stretch
---
Learn it son
---
Lol he can't write rite right
---
Ya sure, if its easier just DM me your discord I'll add ya.
---
&gt;as possible in 8 minutes regardless of who wins?
---
This was the case when horde queues were below 10 minutes. However the queues are now 18-25+ minutes.
---
You can transfer for 20 or 25 dollars if you change your mind.
---
I fkn hate taurens
---
I disagree. 
---
It makes the world feel dangerous.
---
Yes it is amazing and I agree it is very enjoyable.  
---
However, the real reason why people are complaining is that private servers were able to pull of better server quality and faster bug fixes with a fraction of the budget. People are upset because they feel that Blizzard is not providing good enough quality for the subscription fee and for this I can agree on.
---
Smokey's Lighter for additional aoe dmg

....this is so Fucking weird. I used to listen to a song called 'Out in the fields' by Gary Moore and Phil Lynotte. Hadn't heard it in about 12 years and so googled it today... I've never heard of Powerwolf before in my life and I noticed that they did a cover of that song... and just 30 minutes later this post shows up on reddit. Creepy.
---

This is the real answer.

Rogues can't even use deathbringer? Don't have to make things up to look cool
---
You’re not making bots to win premise BGs, you’re making bots to gank other bots.  Just gear out a rogue and have them wait to attack until Coldblood is off cooldown or something.
---
Thank you.

Here's the problem with tanking:  
---
There's really only 2 viable tank classes at the moment. Also, due to usually being the only one in your group rolling for tank gear, you gear up quicker. On top of this, tanking comes with a lot more responsibility and less room for error than most other roles. Also tanks are not in demand at all for raids. So combine an already much lower amount of players rolling tanks with a quicker gearing up path, a fresh tank will be running end game dungeons MUCH less than a dps.  
---
There just needs to be an incentive for tanks to run dungeons or there will always be an imbalance. Whether its helping guildies, getting the first orb, whatever.
---
Who but a scammer would name their character 'Biizzard'? I guess it could also be an idiot, but somehow don't believe this thread is legit. Why the upvotes?
---
I think you missed the point. Video games are an offshoot of capitalism. Without capitalism nobody would have leisure time or money to do anything fun with that time, and thus video games wouldn't exist.
---
You've described the majority of my experience in WSG over 15 years - and that's why I don't play it.  It's often not fun when you're on the losing team, but somebody has to lose every game.  If it's not fun, don't play it.
---
"hey guys, in this AV we are not going to cap SHGY"
---
Oh and maybe set a trap on Galv
---
To clarify, point the camera toward the water and move forward.  Either by holding right mouse, keeping the camera pointed down, and w, or both mouse buttons.
---
The above language seems to indicate that you are aiming your character towards the water, rather than your camera.
---
This prevents you from pancaking on the surface when your helpful friend is being a dick.
---
Bis for what? We're talking actual things, not imaginary specs.
---
Yes you should be aiming your character (via right click/running whilst facing the water) simply having your camera looking at the water won't help.
---
I actually bought the game but still have to play it due to wow, is it alive and well? I heard it had problms on launch with the battlepass
---
Do you think people are going to abandon ranking? The people ranking aren't playing "for fun," they are playing to brag that they played for 20 hours a day versus the guy who played 18. Same issue happened in old runescape, all the fun activities are dead there too.
---
So we can't discuss things that are illegal on the sub then? 
---
Better hope everyone talking about playing while high is in a state where recreational marijuana is legal. But it's still federally illegal. Hmm, how do we account for law differences between countries when modding I wonder?
---
The truth I, the legality of the subject has nothing to do with the conversation. So there's got to be some other reason.
---
Lol, blaming private server players for blizzard's mistakes. 
---
Why was MC possible in less than 1 week? Oh ya, there was a bug that allowed raid groups to get insane experience in dungeons. Add that to MC content that is tenfold easier than private servers, 1.12 talents and 1.12 itemization, and people knowing the fights, it shouldn't be any surprise that it was cleared as soon as people abused there way to 60. 
---
But wait, private servers didn't let you zerg down a dungeon with 10 people and get the same or better experience. Dungeons were harder, and the raid experience penalty was properly in place. A lot of private servers did progressive itemization, meaning a lot of the items that are in classic dungeons weren't even in the game. Some even included the old itemizations. Those servers provided an experience much closer to actual vanilla. But ya, let's blame private server players because why not?
---
Endlessly grinding AV, you know where that wasn't a thing? Private servers. 
---
Most released AV months after WSG and AB came out, and when they did release them, there wasn't crossrealm queues so that AV always popped. AV was really only played during AV weekend. It sure as hell wasn't the main source of ranking, especially at the beginning of a new server. 
---
And speaking of bg weekends, they aren't even in. Another reason we're stuck in the endless loop of AV to rank. But ya, that too is private server players faults, right?
---
And since we're on the topic of ranking, let's not forget that 1.12 patch was released a few months after Naxx. Who was still ranking then? Was there anyone? Naxx items are miles better than the rank 13/14 items. At that point in the game, no one gave a damn about ranking. Yet, here we are. Ranking on 1.12 patch in classic, something that no one did in actual vanilla.
---
OP is 100% right. Private servers provided an experience that is much more like vanilla than classic. Classic is an abomination of vanilla.
---
Exactly. Being a part of the day 2 and 3 shift in strategy was so damn fun. Seeing people listen, coordinate, and overwhelm 30-50% of the Alliance zerg was an absolute blast. Then it developed further into 10-20 of us hearthing back to defend and last as long as we possibly could to give our buddies up north time to get to Van and finish the game. Some games felt like fucking Braveheart and it was beautiful.
---
He looks a lot like my blood elf death knight. But he is probably more close to a human death knight...and I can think of one that killed his own.
---
Why is everybody here out to get me? I try to be helpful... I try to be kind... I try to be supportive... But there is a conspiracy against me... Why!? I don't deserve this. What did I do to you ItsShortsy? If I truly wronged you, how can I make it up to you? I haven't wronged you though... At least I don't think so...
---
The program is probably not designed to handle being in an instance.
---
You'd think people would realize that not everyone has fun the same way. Every single online game has 2-3 "factions" that all derive fun from the game in different ways. Yet everyone thinks only their way is valid.
---
You asked for a price check. About 200-300g for horde. Remember neutral ah takes a 30% cut. Might still be worth selling. You're going to need to advertise on discord, though bc no one checks neutral ah.
---
I don't tend to like pug groups where players reserve items, but Strat Live is the one where I'd expect it for a tank. Like you said, a tank has no drops in that dungeon. Giving the tank some orbs (or w/e the group agrees on) is about the only way you'll pug that place without waiting for hours.
---
Ahhhh that makes sense
---
Would it be enough to just enter a sketchy site? Dont you have to give them some information like a username or Something?
---
I can't believe this is Legion "feature". I played on scriptcraft vanilla back in 2010 and it was there.
---
Figured I would let you see the finished/framed product. Looks good dude, thanks again. 
---
Hope the holidays are treating you well. https://m.imgur.com/a/eEkJC7f

Blizzard doesn't make money that way, people would quit within two months once they cleared Naxx.
---
avg is 35min fam.
---
so what do you do for PvP?
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
with data from back in the day.
---
its 2500  only when the ajustment is negative: (RP - Deacay) = ajustment
---
Generally high cost recipes and BOE epics you all roll, unless it is a MC or something that’s different.
---
That was part of the private server community, but I feel like a lot  of the retail players bought into the hype of "min max classic" or the competitive aspects. On launch the way people rushed through the entire leveling experience spamming dungeons with the mentality "just hit 60 nothing else matters".   
---
I think a lot of the private server players myself included, enjoy the more RPG aspects of leveling and had more fun on the way up.
---
The bottling programs out there are trash. They mainly work off of waypoints. If you’re in a zone that doesn’t have any, the bot is now broken.
---
Battle ress :)
---
Or perhaps Briarwood Reed.
---
It's not that, we just take longer to adapt because it's not as big of a loss for us. Our queues are still instant. Also, due to the way queueing works, horde has their good players spread out in every AV, whilst alliance stacks their players in few of them. So rather than having 1 AV with 30 really good players, horde has 5-10 really good players in every AV, whilst the non-premade AVs om alliance which is the mass majority of them, has mostly average players, since the good ones play in a premade. This alone gives horde a much greater chance of winning, since just 1 good shotcaller is more than enough to tilt the game in your favor. And then we're at it with the queue times, since horde have longer queues, they're more likely to listen to calls since it's more important for them to win games.
---
I think the biggest issue is people want to ONLY play classic wow, when really there isn't a ton to do right now. Takes like 3 hours a week to do your raids and farm some gold. After that there's only very minor things to do.
---
Meh hunter you have to time/weave AS and MS between your autoattack, keep serpent sting up (often enough debuff slots with 16 limit)
---
All while micromanaging your pet
---
And then you can add the trinket swap and mana management with fd
---
It' not incredibly skilled gameplay, but much more entertaining than my vanilla mage
---
And you don't get finger pain because you have to spam the 1 button for hours
---
(Otoh in pvp I often regret not playing a mage and I am preparing a 39 gnome right now to get that nostalgia kick going)
---
For maximum threat get perditions blade + corehound tooth and the dagger gloves...Vishkag is way to slow for tanking.
---
A raid that gives vishkag to a tank shouldn't be suprised when their melee dps quit the raid tbh.
---
And why do you think pallies cant tank raids? Can easily do Ony. Taunt is useless against bosses amyway.
---
If it is ripe with cringey stuff like the "first to hit 60" and "I am a legend" stuff it might actually be kinda entertaining.
---
Gosh you’re cool.
---
Not entirely true, if you tag then your 60 kills you only receive portion of the xp 
---
It’s better xp than if he was in group but not much.
---
I used to do this 
---
Just use 60 power lvl threw quests and dungeons
---
What addons are you using to show the cooldown of counterspell, cooldown of debuffs, and cd of psychic scream on player portrait?
---
Does it really matter if the playerbase is split though?  We have a ton of servers right now.  Game is clearly financially viable with a fraction of our current playerbase since the original plan was for like 10 servers.  So long as blizzard starts merging when populations decline.
---
Can confirm, am leveling human mage. Red is dead. I even tempt my luck with those ?? Lvls.
---
6 -8 minutes. Go get gud and stop crying
---
I mean, he’s sort of right. Private servers would ban botters within the hour they were reported because there’s always someone willing to go watch the player and make an executive decision. 
---
Classic just doesn’t have this. That’s why the botters I’ve reported/friended are still farming.
---
120-150g
---
Have Blizz done anything about any bots at all?
---
I would think so. The CS who helped me get my account back said it happened through one of my addons, so it may have been less the site and more the add-on itself.
---
They don't care. That's why.
---
"Hur dur it is not that eeeaasy".
---
No, it is that easy. Ban at least half of them randomly and most will think twice about using it, this would already improve this issue a lot.
---
*while the dark worgen*

Can’t even hate on the confidence, keep doing you homie

*Joins a PvP battleground with honor rewards and a page dedicated to tracking killing blows, deaths, etc*
---
“Hurrrr AV isn’t PvP” 
---
Yes it is! Just because you can do PvE things DOES NOT MAKE IT 100% PVE. 
---
You’re a lazy fishing leech and there’s no beating around the bush.
---
All of the changes private servers made to make it more difficult are BECAUSE sweaty neck beards ground the content to dust and made it boring.  
---
You’re basically saying blizzard should have planned for how private server players played both in time played and research done when those players ruined the game for everyone who hadn’t spent 10 years playing the same game.  No thanks, no catering the worst type of player.  You all can enjoy the bed you made.
---
Get ganked
---
Is it intended that when I  frost  shock someone they take the damage (it doesn't get resisted) but the slow doesnt get applied? Seems to happen quite a lot
---
Idk but I read that as “she scute” and wondered why they didn’t use scoot instead.
---
meh if i have felhunter i dispel hoj off me lmao
---
Are u saying that none of these problems are problems?
---
Yeh briar wood :)
---
Buff timer or something like that
---
Keep up the good work
---
Tyty was so nice to take my time and enjoy it!
---
Thinkin this was just a troll post, by someone who got ganked a few times while trying to level :/
---
Awesome, grats!
---
shares dr with fear though. i agree locks are op in duels. i feel  bad dueling warrs.
---
You can file a ticket, wait a week, then get a message from a GM that they’re taking a hands-off approach in classic. It’s really satisfying.
---
You just told that poor soul to shut up, and said that he was wrong, when he hadn't said anything to warrant that.
---
I quit after the second paragraph.  On another note, does anyone here know about lawn care?  Should I mow my lawn and "scalp" it on the lowest setting for the winter, or am I supposed to leave it long until it starts to green up in the summer?
---
So many reddit gaming subreddits have the same trend. Starts out extremely hyped and positive on release, things die down somewhat, toxicity takes over and it becomes a cesspool of complaints and demands on perceived fixes. The only subreddit ive not seen this happen on was totalwar
---
PvP will die in late AQ/Naxx just like it did on every private server. People aren't going to play a game where you die to scorch fireblast or face unkillable warlocks that are played to kill all the players who can burst the other classes down in a second. In addition you have things with idiotic procs like the 2 hander from the end of AQ that doesn't break on damage. 
---
PvP simply loses all fun and any semblance of balance in the late game. In Tier 2 it kind of works.
---
1600 rep for a 40m-1 hour game. For anyone not already exalted it’s definitely preferable 
---
Also way more fun
---
This^ most alliance would rather lose than defend and make a game take longer. I think some of it is the fact that the Zerg does work sometimes and no one wants to give up the possibility of a -10 min win.
---
You’re doing the lights work
---
So if
---
 t=time you need to farm on the mage to break even
---
X= farmrate (gold/hr) on the hunter
---
Y = farmrate on the mage
---
t•Y= (96hours)•X 
---
assuming the mage can farm TWICE as fast as a hunter which I think is generous, he would need to level the mage and farm with it for 192 hours to just break even and start benefiting from the mage's farm
---
You guys have a bridge chokepoint... we have a few huts that you can just blow past. 
---
I mean if you want to talk about map imbalance we should bring up other parts of the map too right? 
---
Are we supposed to push bridge when 30 alliance are snowballing us off the bridge? Fuck no.
---
Except against the premade alliance groups, then you just get smashed again aye?
---
The differentiation has been that public figures are allowed to be discussed and named, because they're already publicly known. There is a limit to this, certainly, but it's the general guideline we've implemented for months or maybe even years now.
---
There are times we've messed up and missed things, that's definitely true, but we try our best to be consistent with this.
---
The underlying logic behind our stance is this: there are numerous examples of people, online, getting unfairly or mistakenly harassed due to the weaponization of a large audience. r/classicwow has 400K+ subscribers and we simply cannot allow for the, even if slim, chance of someone getting harrassed by even 1% of the userbase. We make the exception for anyone that is publicly known (e.g. streamers, people that make public posts themselves discussing their ninjalooting) because, at that point, the person is already likely well-aware of the potential impact internet forums can have on them if they're choosing to be a public figure.
---
I'm sorry that our stance can be frustrating to deal with. It's not about not allowing people to call out shitty behavior, but it's about people abusing that power and falsifying an accusation or in some other way misleading the general audience of r/classicwow. We try to strike a balance by allowing the call out of well-known people and leave it at that. Beyond that, I can only suggest you take it to your realm subreddit/Discord or the official forums.
---
I’m saying how you broke tos if you’re harnessing a bot. It’s not that serious ;-;
---
Yeah. I've always found it perplexing how willing people are to just give up gear they spent hundreds of hours obtaining. Freshness is good in some situations, but I marvel at how replacing those endgame epics with greens from random quest givers doesn't snuff out motivation to play when the meaninglessness is made that transparent.
---
lol its 6 or 8pc dreadmist which noone is gonna use over tier 1 and 2. id argue its more time to farm full dreadmistthan tier gear. its also only a chance to happen when meleed. would be cool to test out but im not gonna farm that shit lol.
---
Whatever makes your dick hard buddy
---
Just hoping they remove spellbatching and leeway before that. Arena with spellbatching and leeway would be the most miserable joke imagineable. It would be the most devastating mistake Blizzard made since WoD. It would be so embarrasingly bad that it'd make Fallout 76 look like a blessing.
---
Fishing to summon a boss != fishing instead of doing the content.
---
And you agree there is PVP in AV. Glad we're on the same page now.
---
&gt;&gt; Weak Class identity
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's watered down in TBC.
---
Can you give examples? The only thing I can think of is warrior/rogue with spell reflect, cloak of shadows.
---
&gt;&gt; It literally is. Hybrid DPS/tanks are finally raid viable, while still having weaknesses. TBC's class balance directly fixes all of the biggest issues with vanilla's class balance.
---
&gt;In PvE maybe but Faction and PvP balance is completely broken. Speaking of Balance. TBC servers are always 80% horde. Seems balanced /S.
---
Why would Horde have an advantage in PvP? There's plenty of race/class combinations that alliance is best at.
---
Alliance mages don't really do things
---
Oof
---
Come to Reddit for the memes, not the discussion
---
Dude posting this was AFK on reddit while his discord AV premade team rushed Drek and without warmasters or wolves pulled with a snowball. 
---
But sure, let's highlight this.
---
Probably because they all have that issue?
---
Yes. I mean, I liked it and have a few alts and find lots of things to do that keep me engaged (love playing that ah and hording.) That said, I think that a lot of people don't have the patience or love for the simplicity that I do. Bigger, better, faster, more! That's what people want now a days.
---
Not every bot will do this. Good ones auto decline trade and invites. Always worth trying though.
---
I believe going at least 10 points into ret for persuit of justice is the "best" way to level paladin.  8%(?) Movespeed is just huge as youre leveling.
---
 Once you have persuit, likely you should go into holy for sonsecrate, and then protection for the hit.
---
Yes. Every wow expansion was this dull between patches. Vanilla was overhyped and the "You think you do, but you don't" guy is unironically correct.
---
Viskag in the bank because it is such garbage for tanking. Mirahs some OH with QS.
---
QS isn't even that great of a tank weapon even it is too slow, but it is accessible without taking dps loot, and still faster than most alternatives right now.
---
I hope you got that Viskag in a pug. Because otherwise you should be apologising to your dps profusely, for not doing your research BEFORE going for it. There is a very good chance you never ever equip viskag.
---
Post the export string to pastebin and post it here
---
No- blizzard step it the fuck up
---
The others in the run need gear just as much as I need the orb. If they're not guaranteed a drop, why should I be guaranteed an orb?
---
Stop spreading false information. This is only true of botters who trade massive amounts of raw gold or items to their main. Most of them are doing it through the auction house as there is no guild bank and it still provides the same level of plausible deniability. 
---
If they banned everyone who’s ever bought something from a bot on the auction house, that would be basically everyone.
---
Once every 30 seconds dots are not part of your "rotation".
---
I can enjoy my favorite game, while also making my voice heard of on some of the issues. I always do my best to present it as though Blizzard were reading it, and not like a toddler tantrum, but they’re still complaints. 
---
Just saying, it’s not always hypocritical to have complaints and still play/love the game.
---
&gt; but for months
---
How long do you think AV has been out?
---
The reason is blizzard runs this sub and they see private servers as a threat. If 3 Russians in a basement can provide an authentic vanilla experience then what excuse does billion dollar Activision have for all its issues?
---
Last time I saw it in the AH (horde), just under 400g.
---
I would like to remind people to remain civil. Bashing an entire group of people because some make or use bots is not okay. This sort of behavior will not be tolerated.
---
Giggity?
---
This also isn’t the echo chamber for “omg I love classic.” Both opinions have a place here.
---
Congratulations my friend! May you enjoy the life ahead and the many challenges that will head your way!
---
Thanks for this! :)
---
ITT: Alliance players think it’s really unfair that one team can just skip straight to the final boss of AV with very few NPCs in the way.
---
This isn't vanilla. This is a game with thousands of changes between patches that has killed all PVE difficulty until Naxx, destroyed World PvP due to layering and cross realm BG's allowing players to stack one faction with little to no punishment and garbage virtual servers that have destroyed any fun that could be had in large battles or world bosses. One of the two BG's out is also completely broken, TBC game design and has destroyed group play in favor of solo queueing or worse using a third party exploit to play premades against a solo queue.
---
**This is timewalking Vanilla WoW. Not Vanilla WoW. It's falling apart because all the things the community warned Blizzard about have destroyed the game. It's why they need illegal reputation management on reddits and forums to attack and downvote and criticism while they sell you revisionist history and pretend like Nostalirus didn't exist and even try to limit any discussion of it having existed.**
---
That's sounding more and more like a cop out.
---
&gt; You guys have a bridge chokepoint... we have a few huts that you can just blow past.
---
Which horde completely bypasses anyways with backdoor, and the archers die in 2 seconds and are easily soloable.
---
Killing people doesn't give optimal honor though so why the fuck would you promote people doing it. This is the fucking issue with people's mentality. 
---
Go tower point - Kill LT/Commanders - Wipe - Go galv kill LT then go fish and let horde win. It isn't rocket science. Every player you kill makes you a worse honor farmer and honestly just griefing your own team at that point
---
CONSIDERING AQ was never released on Nost the one that EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT why would any of you claims be valid? Someone should take your upvotes away for spreading false info
---
It’s fairly simple. If you can beat Razorgore you can beat the next 5 bosses, and if you can beat Chromaggus you can beat Nefarian. Vaelstrasz was only hard because 150 DPS was considered the norm rather than downright sad back in the days.
---
I actually think it was much more calculated than it looks. Rogues provide no buffs to raids or utility in any form so blizzard intentionally, imo, made their tier set godlike of an upgrade. T1 set reflected the game in its state blizz wanted it to be. You also don't see things like itemization for shadow priests or boomkins and that was intentional too. That mindset evolved closer to AQ
---
I'm leaving the moment Light's Vengeance opens their pvp server. I would've stayed on Light's Hope if I could over the shit show that is Wow Classic...
---
You are PERFECTLY wrong.
---
Seriously, take all of your understandings and flip them around 180 degrees and there you will find the truth.  Learn to think, idiot.

Submerge really isn't too hard. As long as everyone doesn't lose their shit it's really quite manageable.

We  still have to deal with submerge face quite often cause no one uses any consumes and raids in PvP/farm spec, and it's fine.
---
I agree. I am in mostly bis blues, MC and Ony gear, but I like to run everything from BRD up just for fun. Cleared BRD with 55's and 57's yesterday and it felt great!
---
they predicted queues months before bgs were out, after phase two made too many allies realize they belong on PVE servers picking flowers
---
Imagine using YOURSELF as an example LMFAO blocked trash kid.
---
Omnibar
---
No, its a genuine case of "you think you do, but you don't." Don't try to pretend that this game was any better than it was. Vanilla has always been fundamentally flawed, its just that people couldn't detect those flaws in 2005, so no one abused them. The honor system is the biggest example of this, but its not like the faceroll raids are much better.
---
Its because alliance premades dont get enough on that AV instance and all dodge. Causing basically unplayable AV matches. Do yourself a favor and join a premade server or stick to wsg. If blizzard doesnt fix it, its unplayable without a premade.
---
Not to put gas on your fire, but the WoW classic ranked scene was always going to be garbage and meaningless.
---
It's effectively LFR for classic.
---
They're delusional. The current servers will become the "TBC servers". The vanilla-only guys will have the option to transfer to vanilla-forever servers that will die in 1 month.

I haven't done a ton of 39's but from what I've seen it's taken around 5-15 (similar to the other response you got).
---
Here’s a quick tip to make sure you don’t make mistakes. In your settings, turn on “display target of target.” So now your display will show the target of whoever you have targeted. When in doubt of who the current target is, click the tank, then click on the mob he has targeted.
---
That’ll eliminate 95% of your mistakes, which for dps tends to be targeting the wrong mob and pulling aggro. If a mob aggros the healer though you definitely want to deal with them though, that takes priority over the tank’s target.
---
You might check out a walk-through guide for each instance so you know what to expect in the way of mechanics, but there’s really nothing too difficult that you can’t learn how to do while in the dungeon.
---
Good luck! I just got to my mid 40s so I’m glad to have quest hubs again instead of continent jumping five times for each quest, lol.
---
I know with my mage that they can get hit by frost bolt but resist the slow debuff
---
Does anyone know if AB premades will give more or less honor than AV? Will it be close enough where we could totally ignore AV and honor grind through AB?
---
I am just lvling with minor speed on boots.
---
You’re operating under the false assumption that all of us one want to mindlessly get max honor per hour doing the same exact thing over and over for 12 hours. 
---
What if I just want a fun AV game? Fuck me because I’m not sweaty enough?
---
2 cups a month with how many subscribers this game has should be more then enough for them to remove cheaters from their game. They are getting millions - a month lol.
---
I agree, it seems like a win-win situation to nerf the honor from AV but NocHaNgEs
---
It's like being able to hang out with your old friend again before they got addicted to heroin.
---
Priest of power... gotta be.
---
I see this comparison over and over again and it's so dumb. In LFR, damage is completely cosmetic. Half the raid is afk, only 2 healers are actually doing something and yet noone dies. You can actually die without trying to in classic, even in MC. Even more so in later tiers. In AQ/Naxx, the majority of people raiding MC today will definitely not be able to clear the raids without improving. The mass majority of the playerbase in retail don't raid at all, even though there's LFR. You've got no clue how bad people actually are at this game. When AQ rolls around, the good players from the average guilds will leave for better guilds, and their old guilds will crumble. This has happened on every single private server with progression that has ever existed. There's No reason to believe that it won't happen in classic.
---
Np
---
Right. My point was it’s not a fair game no matter what side you’re on, kiddo.
---
I agree with everything except Alterac Valley.  Using the 1.12 version is a dishonest portrayal of what it was actually like for a majority of classic.  1.5 or 1.8 should have been their go to patch for this specific BG, while utilizing 1.12 for class content.   Other than that, good post.
---
BWL demands more people to actually be paying attention on boss fights and even trash. The fights aren't hard but there is more of a demand on individual attention.
---
Aq40 has gear checks build into fights (ie. Huhuran poison resist, twin emps)
---
Naxx is all about bringing your A game every week.
---
It really is quite clever.
---
I know what you're trying to say, and I agree. However.
---
In all games that have banwaves instead of instant bans all still ruin your current/coming games. 
---
It doesn't matter if they ban cheaters in waves, your current game and coming games until they are banned are still going to be ruined by the cheaters. I don't want them to be banned in X weeks, ban them now, because it's now that they're ruining games.
---
In 4 weeks when they ban some of the cheaters, that's neat and all but those hours are still wasted where you have been against a cheater or with a botter. Cheats are always one step ahead of the anti-cheat, when the wave comes, they all create new accounts and go again and learn from their past "mistake".
---
They usually try to kick/bash regardless of where you stand.  Best to try to bait it out.
---
Assuming 6-month sub ($12/mo), that’d be a $6 cup of coffee, which can easily be met or exceeded buying a fancy medium sized latte of some kind at your average coffee shop in a metro area. A handful of small batch shops in cities have regular coffee at $5/cup.
---
At least that’s how it is in San Francisco.
---
Classic does this as well, more seamless but also with way more shards (every zone). Mobs won't disappear but you will rubberband/desync completely for a couple of seconds while transitioning to another zone. Sometimes it doesn't work very well and breaks. See: Crocodiles at the barrens river, or Mind Vision.
---
It really is lol.
---
The show in general is bad too, but the fascination with this lame song is a mystery.
---
Personally, when I am making a group as a mage, I TELL THE WORLD 1ST ORB ON RESERVE FOR A TANK and I quite literally get 3 tanks messaging me at once, I do it so I don’t have to wait for a group to form
---
And I actually only want to play tbc again tbh classic is cool, I love my guild and what we do and preparing for bwl but it could be so much better.
---
The only reward needed is seeing people like you cry about it. 
---
And I say this as alliance.
---
Why?  The ones at max range can either deal with it if it aggros to them, or run their little legs to you if they can't deal with it.  Why should you stress over it?
---
Yeah mods exactly. Why don't you involve dicks in these meetings?
---
I grind for gold and i create flasks and sell other shit.  I.E., I CONTROL THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION. I get 100% of the profits I create and I get to create as much or as little as I see fit without exploiting my power-dominance to have nameless / faceless Others to die in a sweatshop so I can be a wage slave.
---
Learn to think.
---
**Cool story. Is that why they put old AV in live WoW and kept it from this fake version of Classic?** You Blizard apologists are hilarious. Then again most of you are just shareholders, people who earn a living shilling for Blizzard or illegal forum manipulation which is a FTC violation from a crooked company.
---
The dullness of the game seems to have a lot to do with everyone knowing everything about the game and playing to be as efficient as possible. The more efficient the players are, the faster they complete the content, the faster the game gets dull.
---
This guy gets it, keep the spirit alive!
---
They are that easy to get, people just don't want to go farm them...
---
good luck a) getting the pugs to not defend (theres always a few) and with most of the horde team turtling it can take a while for the 12 horde attackers to finish the game for you oh and b) with the 25 horde camping between IBT and GY from their gyard right there good luck and have fun gettings any lieuts.
---
 I consider myself lucky to get more then 30 rep in a game and my last three took 30, 33 and 42 mins respectively to lose.
---
They're probably notoriously overfarmed on any server.
---
The thing I hated since the Beta are the huge servers. The Game would be so much better with Original Vanilla Servercaps. 
---
I gave up PvP because I just can't bother with this boring grind anymore. I will probably continue to login once a Week to Raid but not do much else.
---
Lol how is it working now with the LAWNMOWER?
---
Its not a fair game in 1.12 version.  Earlier versions saw the horde base riddled with land mines that rogues had to disarm.  These could knock players out of the horde base, if they weren't one-shot directly.  But for whatever reason, they went with an inferior version of AV.  The 1.5 version still had balance issues, but was much more "balanced".
---
Do that in real life then and make something of yourself using capitalism rather than sit on your computer bitching and masturbating all day NEET.
---
this is the no changes experience.  this is how it was.
---
You're right in the level range to farm for bis, so that's what you should focus on doing. You will still be farming bis at 60 so might as well start now.      
---
Don't worry about making mistakes or doing those instances for the first time, we've all been new at some point. The biggest strength of classic is the community, so don't be afraid to reach out and ask people for help or tips, there will always be ton of people willing to help you out.   
---
You can also check out guides online for dungeon strats if you want
---
They don't care. The name Blizzard is always used and abused and they don't outlaw the name from being created on new characters. Don't forget, a lost account to Blizzard is just more revenue from someone having to purchase the game again or pay another monthly fee, there is no benefit for them to enforce their own rules because it would cost them more revenue than that's lost from being quitting over being mad about hacks/bots.
---
The same bots have been roaming servers for weeks and they don't care. People will talk about ban waves and whatnot but that's just BS
---
I wish I had your commitment/willpower to focus on one class. lol
---
Shouldn't need to adapt to an exploit.
---
I wonder if we will see execute tanking in arms stance. That seems like the way to do it.
---
Thank you man. I appreciate the advice
---
First time in BRD I asked my mates if I can roll need on one since I need it for my mount. Now I have learned they drop quite a lot.
---
on alliance people are getting 200-250k a day every single day lol. its not stopping. 150k is a normal/slightly slow day for me now.
---
even though you are a filthy alliance, you have my respect.
---
Never knew about that! Thank you man
---
Call me pessimistic but I wouldn’t be surprised if bots are set up to send a message to their owner once they encounter an error or stop working making it probably a day or two at most before the bots get manually “fixed” and back to farming.
---
nice shadows
---
This is what makes me quit the game. It already is pretty harsh comparing MC gear to AQ, but if they invalidate all gear with each expansion I lose the will to play.
---
I mean why? These servers usually lasted for a year, then naxx release, and after naxx what do you do?
---
1. I personally could prove it by releasing bank statements etc but don't feel the need to prove it. Fan sites and forums have been running since the birth of the internet, previously at the cost of fans setting up the services. Taking up a role in a fan made community has never been easier. People used to do it as their expensive, therefore people doing it for free is not at all inconceivable.
---
2. I can not vouch for members of any existing or previous mod-teams that I have been a part of. If anyone is getting paid by other companies for their moderation I've never heard about it. I have had instances where companies have reached out via private mail/modmail to try and influence posts (this happened on /r/2007scape) however whilst I was at the helm there the demand was firmly rebuked. I of course cannot speak for subsequent mod-teams or teams on other subreddits.
---
3. Only 2 of those 13 subreddits are "real" subreddits. The others are throwaway or dead subs which never took off or just died out. Moderation takes up as much or as little time as you let it, no-one moderates an entire sub solo and most of the grunt work is done by automoderator. Doing small actions here on there on a second monitor isn't massively time-consuming provided the team is big enough to carry the workload together.
---
4. Never worked with marketing or pr agencies. Happily go against the grain of my own existing subreddit teams etc. Integrity &gt; Cash tyvm.
---
Lmao. You sound like someone who has never played horde.
---
Ok zoomer.  Using a spongebob meme doesn’t suddenly make a true thing not true.
---
I mean, there are people who can't clear ony or mc, so yes, they exist. I just think that it would be a smaller % of people since they'd want the conveniences of retail. And classic don't have pet battles.
---
Blameaux represent!
---
Gold is far easier to obtain than it seems. Just stumbling through dungeons will get you a lot of gold. As a priest I was always holy and I farmed less then ten hours total (water essences around DM release) and I got my epic mount money and enough to buy all craftables I want. Priest is especially easy because there is not much to buy. I dont know if paladins have expensive BoEs to buy.
---
Just be smart and always have space in your bags to pick up everything.
---
You are right, it definitely can't.  But the design at least attempted to.  The length of the bridge and archer range for alliance was balanced out by needing to have rogues south to disarm mines to gain access to the Horde Base.
---
It's not the same...but its an obstacle for an obstacle, and thus "balanced" even though these obstacles might not be of the same difficulty.
---
Removing the land mines and making no changes to the archer range/bridge area however shifted balance in favor of one faction.
---
Where is your coffee 6-8 bucks each??
---
Ive been playing on vanillagaming, which has been around 10+ years. You can definitely see where people have fallen off, but there is still an active community of people, always finding things to keep doing. But Blizzard doesnt want a good community they want money first, so they are going to just release TBC.
---
The +3 will give you 45 mana (15 per point if int), a bit of mana regen from spirit (emphasis on a bit), and a fraction of a percent of spell crit.
---
Unless a fight is lasting long enough for the 15% of mana regen from 3 spirit to add up to more than 55 mana, the +100 mana is going to be better.
---
Also dont be afraid of the dungeouns. For one, your dps so just follow the tank. For two, they are all easy as pie. Cant promise they will be fun, can promise they will be easy :P
---
that's just a RP guild rofl. haven't you hear what MMORPG stands for? Many Man Online Role Playing as Girls.
---
Good thoughts. Also your user name is awesome.  Ho Lee fuk
---
He's right about damage scaling, but everything else ughh.. why even continue playing if you dislike the game so much?
---
Although I find your question annoying, the answer is yes it was boring between patches if you're the type of person who gets bored easily.  There was a longer gap between patches than we have had so far, and we likely will see those gaps abbreviated going forward.  People will complain that content is coming out too fast, and people like you will complain that it's coming out too slow and there's nothing to do.
---
Yes but most bots don't have their owner sat watching it. Most people use bots to farm overnight or while they are at work
---
Yup! I call people who complain about Classic ‘Retail Babies’.
---
If you don’t like it and need your hand held to play the game, Retail and it’s fuzzy unicorn handholding and sparkly things is over there. Off you go now - mommy is waiting with your diapers and blankie.
---
Yes, this is a good time to start farming BiS. As DPS you should be fine in a group, just follow their lead and listen to the tank and you will be fine to get your feet wet.
---
Questing, I think I was in Un'goro, WPL and EPL to finish out, but if you're looking to dungeon grind for gear, you'll be there soon enough.
---
Good luck!
---
They could have some sort of spell like blessing of freedom or free action potion.
---
Shadowplay - Nvidia software
---
I mean if you want, go open a webchat. You can talk to a GM in like 10 minutes. I guarantee he will tell you to report in game for botting and that he will put a note on the people suspected of botting. The GMs may handle small cases of botting, but huge widespread bots get sent to the devs in Cali to deal with. From there they will issue a ban wave.
---
I find it's more just needing people to be heads up for dispelling or damage spikes. We lose 1 to 2 with our full raid, but when we went in for the luls with 21 people the day after christmas (to conclude with wiping at 10% on lucifron) we had only 1 or two trash deaths.
---
Let people like things. You dont have to like things that are popular
---
&gt;everyone else has to play more (and therefore pay more) in order to rank up later. 
---
So by this logic your saying people are going to unsub from the game after they rank up? Yeah that doesn't make any sense.
---
Im shocked no one ever talks about dark pact. When i was lvling it was my favorite spell by farrrr. Healers who were used to life tappers LOVED me cuz i just drained my imps mana and never needed heals haha
---
Before I even start reading more of this: thanks for the drain tanking guide.
---
Beeing a idiot on reddit and dragging it out for hours. Yawn.
---
I'd consider that decent gear because you were going for a set. The most important thing to do this is a good Mana pool.
---
Not a direct answer to what you should be doing, but rather something about you being nervous about running the end game dungeons;
---
People are generally speaking very nice. If you give them a heads up, saying something like "Hey! This is my first time doing this dungeon, are there anything I need to be aware of?" You will almost every time get someone to guide you around if there is anything special happening. 
---
This is a social game, so don't stay quiet in the background because you feel like "you should know this by now"! That MC geared tank running with you is also just a person sitting behind a screen. :)
---
It's important to remember that for 99,9% of the playerbase back then everything took much longer to achieve. Much much longer. No one had a pre-bis list of what instances and bosses to kill. Doing dungeons themselves took much longer due to poor gear and skill. The vast majority of guilds spent months just progressing through new raids before they were on farm etc etc.
---
What does this all mean ? You didn't have as much time to get bored between patches. The way I remember it every new patch was more of a "great, more cool stuff to do" rather than "finally something to do!" 
---
When BWL dropped we didn't keep doing MC just because of Bindings (hell, we didn't even know what they were yet), we did it because BWL gave us 3 drops per week and half our raid was still desperately short on gear.
---
When BGs arrived we didn't grind AV rep in three days and never stepped in there ever again, we spent a few hours doing BGs every night because it was fun and we had rivalries with other guilds. 
---
The first time I can remember being straight up bored with the game because of a content drought was the break between Black Temple and Sunwell in TBC, which came out nearly a year apart.
---
At this point, I wonder what Titan would have been like if they quit making WoW at the end of WOTLK and instead of cataclysmic pandas, time travel, and demons they put all that developmental energy into a new MMORPG.
---
Yea I have a somewhat small mana pool and huge + healing with my gear right now so I'm thinking the 100 mana will be best
---
There is/was some bc servers (not sure of they are still running). So the options were there, but i think vanilla was the one with most servers and players :p
---
Why do people farm these grubs?
---
Hey man. Your guide really helped me level super quick on my warlock alt. Really helped me understand the class much more deeply than I would have otherwise. Currently lvl60 gathering all my pre bis gear. Thanks for the info and all the hard work.
---
I think they'll do it to appease the guys who cry because their bwl/aq purples get replaced by greens in outland and don't want to lose their character. No work for them and it shows they listen to the community. 
---
Only way classic+ will happen is if they launch a new WoW 2.0 cycle after going through tbc/wotlk
---
Again not sure what part of my UI you're asking for, but I think you might be referring to the AddOn called Doom CooldownPulse
---
Jesus I hope not lol
---
Full ret is about waiting for procs. 
---
The fun leveling you're seeing doesn't really get rolling until your mid-late 40s. You go 11 holy for cons, and the rest in prot. Blessing of sanctuary plus holy shield means you can pull tons of mobs and aoe them down, especially if they are undead. Before that it's doable, but not super efficient.
---
Not sure never played back then but i find it hard to imagine that capping flags and winning can give up 4k honor like you can get in av
---
Just wanting to clarify for the OP in case they think that decent gear has to be farmed in dungeons, when in fact it can all be bought off the AH for like 5g a piece.
---
&gt;This is implying blizzard will actually ban the bots, which they probably won’t.
---
They ban bots 100%. I've reported several bots and haven't seen them ever again.
---
Horde pvp is just what the allaince call turtle.
---
Cuz they don't care
---
loot every corpse you can, use recall trinket before they take over the base, turn in everything for rep.
---
Lesser reason. Cus console CPU's were an outdated, slow clocked pre Ryzen AMD CPU that couldn't handle a MMO and ACTIVISION/Blizzard only makes games that are on all platforms now (outside mobile).  
---
Main reason. Bobby Kotick also became convinced that the future of his company was Esports (Overwatch transitioned to Titan). Same reason WoW has been run into the ground and balanced around failed esports that no one watches on Twitch but viewbots and a real audience of a few hundred. You could argue Kotick was initially right . He got the fools at Twitch/Amazon to give him 90 million for Overwatch rights and also made deals with Disney/ESPN.
---
Amazon probably realizes that the audiences for most of these esports is all fake/bots now though outside Asia and MOBA's. So that contract ain't happening again. Amazon is also now trying to make their own games (and MMO).
---
If you are an alliance premade, the goal is for horde to try and stall you out and hope you will just afk out because of the ineffeciency.
---
Larval acid
---
Ah yeah that's garbage
---
I haven’t lagged in Classic since P2 launch day.
---
Fishing and cooking yield a profit on my server. If it didn’t, you may have a point. Inflation is normal in mmorpgs and in real economics so I don’t see that as evidence of botting impacting the economy.
---
Your acting like Private servers were perfect, I heard plenty of horror stories about them. And it's doubtful any private server had the population of Blizzards  servers.
---
Dude no. Im saying my chat is full of “name added to friends”. Nothing else is happening. It’s not people going on and offline. I’ve played this game for 15 years. I know when something isn’t right. I am getting spammed with people being added to my friends list but they are not on my friends list.
---
How is it not the same?
---
But if they make shit products they don't maximize dollars. They only maximize dollars by making quality products.
---
Why do you talk if you don't have a clue? Smaller the server higher the price. Any server in EU that is not FULL status has them for 800-1000.
---
Lol hard to do as the GM. I need better raiders. About 8 or so of us actually try hard.
---
I'll preface this and say I worked there and have friends that still work there. They have someone to go check on the botter when you report them, but it's not the GMs "job" persay to ban them 1 by 1. They generally document everything and punt it to the devs for a ban wave. It's been discussed like years ago that banning 1 by 1 gives the cheaters and edge and keeps them 1 step ahead. Steam bans in waves, blizz bans in waves, almost every big company bans cheaters in waves.
---
Blizzard ban in waves, they always have. There will probably be a ban wave at some point.
---
I remember when glider was still a thing you could just open trade 3 times and it would automatically log them out. Obviously same faction.
---
I hate people like you who try to defend obvious bots. We wouldn't be calling these bots out if it wasn't so painfully obvious.
---
Thats kind of how I've always thought too with the expansions since watlok being kinda hit or miss with nothing really matching the same level imo and much of that stemming from overstretching a game and trying to keep it new where I've always thought they could have done it better in a new game.
---
Items that are totally grabbable for a leveling paladin
---
I only dislike how fast they go through phases, and afraid they would then add TBS, then WOTLK...
---
I dont know the talents and couldnt find the old ones online, but the gear is far more than a few %.
---
I bet a mage in new prebis does at least double the damage compared to old gear. 
---
And this is not just prebis. Like nearly every item you can think of had no spellpower before rework.
---
love the technique here. god bless you OP
---
people will never understand this, no matter how many times you tell him.
---
you should always do ban waves as opposed to individual bans. wave-banning makes it harder for hackers/botters to get around anti-cheat.
---
Also they nerfed the stats of early raids later into the expansion to make intro raids more doable.
---
Were fighting literally nerfed versions of the fights with buffed versions of talents and gear. It would be the equivalent of going into a prior raid tier on BFA with gear from the current tier and going 'how did it take method so long to clear this?' while also studying their strats and video walkthrus how to do it.
---
Well by that logic it is fair.
---
You get less honor per minute winning a zerg than you do losing while doing objectives.
---
Something went fucky with a lot of the quests and you can't complete them.
---
Was just doing Jintha'alor a few days ago and we couldn't get the key from the guardian in the cave because she didn't spawn. The ancient egg was also despawned and hasn't been seen from the day before already.
---
This will continue to happen until people who fail the quests abandon them which will continue to happen on a weekly basis until Blizzard fixes this.
---
People around me who are depressed spend 16 hours a day infront of the PC. I meant those people
---
It yields a profit still, sure, but the profit would be greater if not for bots. Not necessarily so sure about cooking, as I don't really think bots influence that economy too much. But sure, inflation is normal, but bots is increasing it. The thing is that bots will not destroy any one part of the economy but it certainly affects almost all of them. And my issue isn't that I can't fish or w/e because of bots, it's that my time becomes less valuable when farming gold because of bots, since even if I can farm much faster than a bot, a bot can keep going for much longer, which means that the people with bots have a large advantage over the people without bots.
---
OmniCC
---
A Mod actually discussing and considering reason? And not being a dickhead?
---
Reddit Mods could learn a thing or two from this.
---
Hostile spell triggers the bot to continue attacking is my guess
---
This completely glosses over the arguement that a lot of people played Classic with the hopes of those long AV battles that were legit the only time anything has ever felt like a WAR in Warcraft's pvp.
---
You know that BG ques are based on players queing on either faction right ?
---
if 18 horde que and 10 alliance que for WSG the game will open faster for alliance and the 8 other from horde will have to wait for a new game to open....
---
The purpose of slow offhands is so you don't eat enrage stacks. That's pretty much it.
---
It’s really not
---
At least it's an additional annoyance for the owners I suppose. We all must contribute to win the not war!
---
Wow, with today's online community Im surprised no one griefed it yet.
---
I'm objecting to an exploit. You're whining that you can't win conventionally...
---
My server has level 60 Hunters in BoE greens, no trinkets with pet names as Chinese characters farming one spot for hours and hours.
---
We all know bots suck and ruin the game.  Especially honor farming bots.  Why not take the easy way out and address the REAL ISSUE with why these people are botting? Because av awards too much fucking honor.  Nerf av honor to the ground and release AB.  The entire ACTUAL PVP community rejoices as goes to premades and people have 0 reason to bot in av anymore.  Win win win.
---
TB and Mulgore in general are just so visually stunning.
---
Ya.... No. You are wrong lmao
---
It might be possible that the bot have a “reset” setup. After x seconds of inactivity or error it uses the Heartstone then follow a “reset” path before restarting the farm.
---
But aren't those subscriptions usually using stolen cards? So the charges will eventually get reversed?
---
&gt;Post evidence
---
Ive been playing since launch and I'm still enjoying the game with my 1 character.
---
Does that video not prove you wrong?
---
ofc
---
The best thing about classic are the classes. Making an alt is so damn hard, I kid you not I've   gone in with the mind that this next class will be my main! And ended up switching still several times, they are all so damn good at different things.
---
That's just because nobody knew any better
---
Yes, most of the end game is grinding mats and rep.
---
To keep them aggroed I guess
---
I think you're misunderstanding the viewpoint a lot of pro-TBC people have. It's not that they desperately want flying mounts, it's that they don't really think it's a big deal. Flying mounts might've been the first step into what WoW has become down the road, but by themselves they are just a few small baby steps. It took years and years of further development down that road before people went "oh yeah, I guess it all started with flying mounts". 
---
And there's no "slippery slope" argument to be made against them either, since if Blizzard just decides to follow the path the game went back then there's no design decisions to be made. It's all already planned and laid out. 
---
You can keep saying that Blizzard has admitted it was a mistake, but back then they really weren't. They were just one of those things that become a problem way down the line. But that doesn't matter if you stop before you get to that point next time around.
---
I'm a noob at discord, how do i get to the warrior discord?
---
What derpy hunched over combat stance? Let me present you... YAAAAAAR
---
Don’t listen to this idiot.  Join the rogue discord. Use a spreadsheet.  Hit is very good past the cap still
---
What are the best dungeons to farm BiS 55+? I'm in the same range now and feel like I'm not doing as much dps because my gear is meh
---
no one asked you
---
What level did you farm these areas? I’m just making my first Twink and am doing DM and WC bosses at the moment at level 10.
---
It's pretty easy to kill all the archers solo...
---
I think your mistake is thinking this is a "now" problem versus the real cause of the issue is your actions 4 months ago and your lack of setting the right tone at the beginning.
---
To everyone agreeing to this post - please go back to your favorite private server. Frustrated from Blizzard? You won't have to deal with them on a private server. Don't want to pay a monthly subscription? Private servers are free to play. You're tired from the behavior of the community of Classic? Private servers have their own community.
---
The majority of the people playing Classic at the moment are loving every second. Please leave us out of your toxicity.
---
Shutuuup. We get it, private servers were awesome. We don’t need 10 posts and hundreds of comments about it every week.
---
Yes, mediocre products typically cost less than quality ones.
---
&gt; maximize dollars
---
This isn't what I said, is it? I said "maximize dollars in, minimize dollars out". If I have to invest $100 on a quality product and get a 10% return, or invest $50 on a mediocre product and get 100% return...
---
"Companies have to make good products" is an on paper capitalist argument. You would /hope/ that companies succeed by creating "quality work", but that's not necessarily the case in the real world.
---
Imagine ranking in classic wow.
---
Imagine.
---
I do. In fact, I do more than you. In particular I work as an educator deconstructing capitalism as the engine of globalized inequality. I'm not bitching.  While I am forced to work under the oppressive boot of a capitalist system, I undermine it. It can be changed, it will be changed.  The flower is blooming.
---
Got benediction and 5 tier pieces still not onyxis attunement lol. God damn qurstline is long
---
If you’re a geared tank who knows how to make the instance go smoothly, and you’re running with undergeared or leveling healers and dps I have no qualms with you reserving all the orbs. If you and the healer are both geared and don’t need any loot while all of the dps need something or aren’t geared/doing more than double to triple your dps then tanks and heals should have claim over all the orbs. If you’re NOT a geared tank or healer and you need loot, then hell no you don’t deserve to be reserving an orb. 
---
As a geared 60 mage who doesn’t need any gear from strath live, I am down to go in if I have an equal shot at an orb. I’ve made deals with tanks where if I’m responsible for 40% of a groups overall damage when the first orb drops then I’m allowed to need it with them and seeing as half the dps who want to run it are either not level 60 or half their gear is greens my service is just as valuable to the group moving efficiently as a tank or a healer. 
---
The other thing I’ve done is set up 3 man groups with a tank and healer who know me and know I’ll do the dps of 3 leveling dps’s and those go smoothly (though slightly slower than if you had 3 geared dps) and we round robin the orbs where if you won one you pass until the other two have one as well. 
---
Basically just cuz you’re a tank who doesn’t need anything and has run the instance 20 times doesn’t make you special. There are capable dps out there who don’t need anything either and are just running for rep/orbs. If you’re melting through the packs at a fast rate it sure as hell isnt because you’re a geared tank benevolently helping your group, it’s because there are dps making your run go twice as fast as it’d go if you were running with entry level dps. Time is money and if dps makes you go significantly faster they deserve just as much as you do.
---
instant Q allies still bitching ? reddit is the best
---
And to compund on it, the first few raids you may have got a couple of items outta MC for the entire raid. Having a full clear every week for 7 to 12 more weeks worth of gear to the raid is a BIG deal
---
&gt;(which WoW also doesn't have)
---
Huh I wonder what this is.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warden_(software)
---
all right let's not pretend flying mounts didnt affect wpvp
---
Ironforge is badass for sure (that music!). But more than Thunder Bluff?
---
Could they not just have different ban strategies? Like ban wave for leveling/farming bots and instant ban for av afkers spamming 3 buttons in a repeated sequence on a time loop?
---
The warmasters were always able to be pulled out
---
You got the iceblood tower choke so what the fuck are you even on about and then towerpoint you get max value from having archers meanwhile alliance shitty stoneheartbunker gives no use at all...
---
What pserver was this on?
---
Very cool post! Thanks for sharing! However nothing good comes from complacency and praising billion dollar companies.
---
 "Haha i love Nestle bottled water and anyone who doesnt is just complaining haha"
---
The ppl complaining are the ones who care. The people blindly praising blizzard are the oned enabling.
---
You vastly underestimate the number of people who love TBC and WotLK.. you will be increasing your possible players, not decreasing them.
---
Hey I won’t hurt ya, some others probably won’t be as nice though :(
---
Can you help with how you got consoleport to work properly with xbox 1 controller? The auto setup doesnt work at all.
---
I explored everything between level 11 and 14. I as a Priest dont need much gear from dungeons.
---
You can explore everything before level 10 with a higher level escording you. ( I did most without and wasted 15 hour on exploring. )
---
This is actually a pretty reasonable explanation, thank you for responding
---
looks like he has Bartender installed, you can hide the keybinds with it
---
I mean, if you hit 60 and did MC, there hasn't really been any content dropped that was a huge upgrade over it, barring the like 4 people who get High Warlord/Grand Marshal and get the gear from that.
---
Maybe. I just wonder why TBC private servers were never as big a success as vanilla ones.
---
Please don't put everyone in the same basket, that's not right.
---
Thousand Needles is awesome as well.
---
They just don't give a shit, it's that easy really.
---
Hmm, i am talking about, when abilities with cds appear on middle of the screen when they can be used again, like a pulse, :) i guess its the addon you said, thanks !
---
if u get into a good guild they might get u geared fast but otherwise getting raid gear will take a while
---
preraid bis u can just grind, u can grind gold and buy braces+belt for ur boe if they're any good
---
just play if u feel like playing
---
Lol this needs more visibilty. Saying it's a légion feature and linking a 2008 video of the shortcut lol
---
You forgot to mention how useless improved drain soul is lol
---
And this will potentially ruin BWL too. MC gear was mega buffed. Mageblade had no spellpower on it before for example.
---
People will be walking into BWL with like ten buffed MC items.
---
I sold mine for 300g and regret it now. Wish my alc had it.
---
I thought running to top left corner of the first hallway and spam /tar jed was enough?
---
Didn't know this was so controversial. MB
---
Paladins are objectively inferior in almost every way to warrior tanks.
---
Which server?
---
Makes sense
---
Any server you recommend?
---
I'm going to be honest here. I totally expect nobody to agree with me. I think Classic "failed" because of you fucking goons. Seriously. Vanilla WoW was fine existing on servers like Nostalrius. And then it went mainstream (among the regular gaming populace) and you fuckin shitheads ruined it. It only works in a small carefully managed ecosystem. Money being involved *very much*  ruins what this is. 
---
This is obviously my opinion. You're welcome to agree or disagree. I don't think or expect anyone to approach me with some real game changing perspective.
---
You know if any :)
---
How do you know they're bots?
---
&gt; Male vs female population has no bearing on how a grammar school works.
---
It's an analogy
---
&gt; no Boys Extracurriculars are allowed until more Male students enroll in the school.
---
An analogy that you ignored
---
Yeah but you can execute again so quickly anyway is it really worth waiting?
---
300ms plus non-terrible server tick rate feels better than this awful 500ms spell batching garbage if you ask me.
---
too bad you’re a gnome.
---
Lol... no. The tone and actions are good. When the alliance pop dies you can no longer recruit.
---
Why does everyone on Reddit always assume something negative? We are up front with everyone on the goals. However, people are complacent because they know we can’t replace them for underperforming. 
---
This is a now problem. My guild is considered the best English speaking guild on my server and we’re currently ranked number 2 on Warcraft logs for the server. We want to be number one not just on our server. We need players who want to raid at a high level. We need players who enchant their gear. We need players who research every possible boost to their dps. 
---
The problem is as I said. There isn’t anyone to recruit until recently. If you aren’t there stop assuming it’s so negative.
---
What do you mean that they are "hidden"?
---
Those BiS lists all assume you have songflower and ony head buffs. Stacking crit should be locks priority till you can have imp SB up 24/7 in raids.
---
They could have chosen to enroll in a school that didnt have a gender imbalance.
---
Also, thanks for explaining the human birthing process, but I was already aware that I did not start my life at a Gender Select screen. It's called an analogy.
---
People were troglodyte.
---
tank building like tin can with no +hit gear, people going full fire resist on ragnaros and so on.
---
even the average LFR raider nowaday have more game knowledge than the world first rag raider.
---
Crit cap is useless. Who cares about white hit cap? Blaster is not useless. Yellow hit cap is all that's relevant
---
OP just wants to find something to whine about. The fact that Classic's game client is based on a Retail fork is still upsetting so many whiners it's hilarious.
---
That's what I was thinking. No way you'd make a bot and not have a feature to hearth to UC and fly back. There's a good chance the bot can even repair gear as well.
---
So when should you use the macro? right after you complete a swing? and also, is it worth speccing into improved slam if you have BRE?
---
I'm on a PvE server, and not huge into ranking either haha. Otherwise yeah 100 hp would be a huge gain.
---
I mean an efficient one ;)
---
[Funny, I dinged at pretty much the exact same spot.](https://i.imgur.com/RZvZlyb.jpg)
---
Keep in mind that priests can do solo Maraudon princess runs. With herb it’s 40-50g hourly for sure. Granted you have to be 60 to do it.
---
You just sound vengeful and its consuming too much time.
---
I feel like most peoples main complaints all boil down to 1 thing. The game hasn't changed, the way we play has. It's all about getting max level and gear now. Before its was about community and the leveling experiences
---
Grats! What is the Addon that outlines your items with colored borders and is it ranking your items somehow? Or is that just ilvl?
---
PvP was also much more rewarding for casual players. Arena system made it more skill based and meant that BGs weren’t dominated by premades or raiders shitting on you with their gear. Also getting PVP gear was accessible for everyone. I was a big PvP guy back then but I can’t be bothered with this current iteration.
---
I never said they banned people that bought from bots. If a GM sees you knowingly partying with a bot though or directly benefiting from them at no cost to you, *it is basically your bot too*. Have fun dealing with customer support in that case.
---
peak wow subs was bc/wotlk so not sure why you think the game would die if they released servers for it? 
---
as for the private servers thing I think thats because no pservers ever did it right and also you could never copy your vanilla character over to BC meaning you'd lose a lot of character progression
---
not really, you can get 2 cups of coffee for about a online game.
---
Coffee here is far less worth.
---
im 60 and 4747284483 runs into the sgc+hoj grind now.
---
Same with quest drops? Say I need the corrupted brains from BFD naga I just stay in ghost form and a friend kills everything and then I rez and loot?
---
the sims i linked allow you to disable world buffs and see how that affects gearing decisions. give them a shot!
---
And if the gender balance in grammar schools mattered to how the school functioned, that might be a worthwhile point to make.
---
Yes, you made an analogy. A bad one, where the crucial piece of information (the consequence of the imbalance) wasn't the same as in the subject being discussed.
---
Not downvoting or engaging in the discussion above but, I'm curious, why do you still play? Why not just stop playing since you clearly hate the game/company?
---
the geometry may have existed since 1.12, but i believe there have been some wall physics changes on retail since vanilla to change how players interact with walls when they run into them. not sure how it's playing out in this situation, but i'm fairly sure they changed wall physics to reduce the amount of wall-climbing players are capable of doing but autorunning into walls and hammering jump
---
so maybe it's that?

At first I thought it was just the two of you
---
I was so excited to see someone generating a story with 
---
actual in game footage (holy shit!)
---
but it kept building,
---
more characters,
---
more body language,
---
and then you guys started blowing my fucking mind!
---
first of all this is next level shit starting right here
---
wave of the future type stuff
---
second of all the wow classic forums is a safe place to practice being bad for a while, till you polish your craft. (something we all need but few can find).
---
For instance: at 3:13 forward the voice actually switches which character is moving their hands while talking for about 5 seconds.  Is disorienting.
---
but the use of actual ingame mechanics to tell story just blew my mind.
---
Combat with multiple npc's followed up by 4 actual players wearing the same gear
---
respawn of mobs while yall were camping in their camp, so over her shoulder a mob just faded into camera, but framed perfectly at the edge.  Timestop 13:27 Just OMG, ingame effects like respawn being used at an academy level of cinematographers acumen.

**TLDR:**  Flashes of genus, consistently funny, a few technical glitch.

It takes 10,000 hours to reach talent

Here's a video about what you realize along the way
---
[Ira Glass on The Creative Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHrmKL2XKcE)
---
Yes my fond memories of BG's were likely from before they became cross-realm. I remember queuing up with my guild and getting matched against rival guilds, that was awesome.
---
The whole "teleport to an instance and get auto-grouped with some random strangers" clearly inspired dungeon finder, raid finder etc.
---
If this is your main I would just sell it. You’ll replace it soon anyways with quest bows (e.g. cliffrunners aim) so the gold is more valuable for you at this point.
---
I am
---
on Dreadmist as well. Farming
---
a lot fel cloth recently. Guess who’s there? Since Weeks every 2nd Day a Hunter with same equipment and bot behaviour. Reported dozens of times by me and others. Does he still farm? Yes, logged in a few hours ago :-)
---
Same. Hopefully they add faction change because   id take it up in a heartbeat. 25 min av and 14 min wsg queue time id absurd
---
No but we still often beat 40 man alliance premades because they suck balls.
---
Twisted Realms

Tank here, I raid log now.

People willing to offer orbs or payment for a run typically arnt worth the headache.

Is that supposed to mean something? Plenty of vanilla servers are 80 20 too.
---
&gt;You guys have a bridge chokepoint... 
---
Which  you can just skip, not being able to read is a thing, but you aren't even able to watch illustrations.
---
I’m in the process of learning how to solo DME as a warlock. I’ve heard people talk about using weakauras to make enemy cast bars visible from a distance for bosses like Hydrospawn. I’ve downloaded weakauras but is there a particular script or something I need to add for this purpose? I’m not familiar with weakauras yet.
---
Still are. I had a 6 minute loss to alliance yesterday with no towers down, no nothing done, just all straight to Drek, down and over.
---
I hate pvp so I cant really speak about that to be fair. But yeah the arena matchmaking clearly adds fairness and turns a pretty mindlessly grind into something closer to a real competition.
---
My point is how do you differentiate a bot selling an underpriced item to a normal player compared to the bot deliberately selling it underpriced to their main? Smart botters have gotten clever with how they move gold around.
---
Properly pricing things you want to sell is more of an art than a science. Try selling for what you think it's worth. If it sells, great! Raise the price a little next time. If it doesn't sell, either keep trying if you're patient, or lower the price.
---
I don't think that blizzard runs this sub, at least that's what people have been saying so that doesn't make any sense. 
---
Honestly I'm struggling to come up with a reason why mentioning a pserver, whether dead or alive, is a community-decided issue. 
---
Advertising, in any form, is generally annoying but simply mentioning and discussing something should be fine, especially if this is not a blizzard backed subreddit and is a community subreddit.
---
I can't tell you how many times on onyxia or rag or whatever when I'm the only healer alive after onyxia turns and breathes/swipes because I have HP enchants :).
---
So it does carry over into PvE as well.
---
Can't heal If you're dead.
---
You are not counting correctly. You think you are , but you aren't.
---
You can't see real health of enemies.  
---
Addon just know health of that mobs and show it, but with players you can't predict their health.
---
POGGERS
---
From what I’ve gathered on this sub, one thing people loved about vanilla is that the game wasn’t optimized by every player. The majority of people just played for fun, didn’t try to get rank 14, didn’t clear raids asap, specced for enjoyment and not to min-max. 
---
People then turn around and think a game where the majority of players all min-max the same build and chase an optimized experience the same way will be the same game as vanilla. 
---
Blizzard isn’t forcing anyone to only play AV like OP is complaining about. The problem is players can’t fathom doing something that isn’t the most optimum thing and would rather be miserable and chasing that extra dopamine hit.
---
Not really. I know exactly why your guild (doesn't) work.
---
I've been looking around the web trying to figure out what "Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to X" means, but I can't find a conclusive answer. Can someone explain this to me or at least point me in the right direction?
---
Huh
---
So characters in full Naxx gear can solo Stratholme, or what? Because I remember soon after TBC went live people's jaws were dropping at seeing a paladin solo the Baron at level 66 or whatever.
---
I guess you could
---
Not what I'm talking about.
---

---
He patrols. You'll only tag him if he is patrolling near the entrance. You have to stay there for 1-2 minutes to be sure, spamming the macro constantly or using unitscan. This method is much faster.
---
&gt; That all being said, 
---
What follows this clause should be contradictory to a previous point
---
&gt; enjoy what you have because we could not have it at all.
---
But instead you just summarized your post. People do this when they are not considering an opposing viewpoint, merely doubling down on their own.
---
You want your cake and eat it, too.
---
Wanna rank up among the first and get those titles/mounts/gear? You gotta do what the farmers are doing.
---
You want to rank up slowly and play by having fun? Play WSG and you will get there eventualy, probably a few months after the hardcore crowd.
---
I bet if WSG was the primary honor farming spot people would whine there's no variety and that AV should have the same honor gain to make it more exciting for others.
---
When my account was hacked it was turned into a gold farming bot. It was banned within the day, this was only because my in game friends reported my account because I wasn't replying and spam running bc dungeons
---
Just being a higher character level helps a ton with soloing due to mobs chance to hit on you being lower.
---
It's called "Loot filter". Don't know if such addon exist.

What if you have a grp of 6 l, clearing to Jed/tend in a short time and you want to knock out 5 runs? 
---
I can also imagine other reasons you would want it be more efficient. But I'll let you exercise some critical thinking.
---
Ah, yes I remember hearing this 3 months ago. Okay. \*still waiting\*
---
I’ve been playing classic for about 3 months casually. I have a level 23 mage and a level 17 hunter. I love coming online and hopping on one or the other and just getting my chance at chilling out on the pc in the evening. I don’t feel behind, I know when I’m at 60 I can go raiding or dungeoneering and do what I want to do. Which will probs be farm rare profession patterns and try and make gold.
---
One can criticize its shortcomings, but a blanket statement like "fuck capitalism" just makes one come off as an edgy college freshman and contributes nothing.
---
i can assure you that i have read the entire post. i still think that my initial claim is correct "ppl managing it can't prove that they aren't getting payed and commentators can't prove that moderators are getting payed".
---
would u consider this a witch hunt or a logical conclusion?
---
you didn't answer this: is it possible that a multi-billion company may invest in astroturfing to protect its assets? is it possible that such a company may *or may not :P* manipulate threads in order to protect its interests or limit costs? is it a thing to buy votes on reddit?(yeah i can link several sites where you can buy votes but i guess you're gonna ban me for that) :)
---
&gt; therefore people doing it for free is not at all inconceivable.
---
i never said that is inconceivable. all i said was that both hypothesis are believable. also i think that both are actually happening. there are moderators on reddit managing for free and others for mercantile purposes. the only weird thing here is the reaction:
---
Astroturfing on reddit? vote manipulation? YOU'RE INSANE, HAHA, EVERYONE LET'S SHAME THIS PERSON FOR SUGGESTING THAT! this is a an overreaction and it creates suspicions.
---
another thing that's weird is that moderators from hearthstone and wow are moderators here too. btw most the moderators here have at least 5 or even more subs in moderation.
---
happy new whatever
---
yes much better architecture
---
There's no threat API in classic, so there will be no "normal threat addon".  
---
All threat addons estimate your threat based on combat log.  
---
Either Blizz add new API or wait until TBC.
---
Muh...Muh...Muh immersion.
---
Bro that sounds like more than one line of code
---
Have you been watching me play through the window?
---
You can blame that on streamers and try-hard chads. My friend said he’s get auto kicked all the time from AV because his gear wasn’t “good enough”. Like really? That’s not the community was at all in actual vanilla. Another reason why I won’t sub back
---
Even if you didn't need to min-max in a 15 year old game (which is wrong of course, you don't need to min-max if you just want to clear content  but you absoultely need to min-max if you're going for stuff like server/world first, clear times, or just want to be more efficient), min-maxing is fun for some of us :)
---
&gt; Not only that but you have a choice at character creation between horde and alliance. Nobody had a character selection screen at birth where they choose their sex after months of life-beta and looking the consequences of their sex-choice up online
---
Read that.
---
That's what you wrote. That was your contribution. Explaining that Gender Selection screens do not exist in real life. 
---
Forgive me if I don't value your opinion on my own contribution, given yours.
---
Congratulations!
---
The point is they have access to it. The class with 3 fears can get another one just coz.
---
Berserker rage &gt; Charge &gt; Zerk stance &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Def Stance &gt; 1 Sunder on each target &gt; Taunt skull/main target and keep threat on it until it dies. Caster mobs can essentially be ignored other than an occasional taunt if you have a melee dps in your group
---
&gt;Pretending raid logging isn't a plague affecting classic player 2-3 week after reaching max lvl heh?
---
I'm not denying it, I'm saying I don't understand it.  If you choose not to log on between raids, that's fine.  But don't come here complain that there's nothing to do.
---
Good stuff here, closing in on 60 on my warlock. Your drain tanking guide was extremely helpful
---
I tell everyone I talk to that wants to get into classic; just do it. 
---
You may have this feeling of being behind but you have plenty of time to catch up. And like a few people have said, people will run MC and all raids through the life of classic. 
---
Just play the game and enjoy it to your hearts content and you’ll find yourself with the rest of us. Enjoy brother and I wish you luck!
---
&gt;You want to rank up slowly and play by having fun? Play WSG and you will get there eventualy, probably a few months after the hardcore crowd.
---
thats not how this system works though, there is no "you will get there investually" every week you need to finish in a higher bracket than you want to each (or 3-4 weeks in the same bracket) or you will never get there. So if you aren't more efficient than other rankers you will never get there.
---
Are you new to WoW? Blizzard *always* hands out bans in waves
---
It would be a good argument if Blizzard ran this sub.
---
You expecting a multi billion dollar company to pay attention to a digital museum?
---
Hi fellow Dreadmist Alliance!
---
They do have an incentive to run strath live: a chance to get an orb, just like everyone else. Or you can do non-rr groups with multiple chances.
---
The myth about strath live is every other class needs items from that place. False. That place drops almost nothing for anybody. The mask of the unforgiven is the only real good piece of loot and not only is that bis for warriors before lionheart helm, it has like a 70% drop chance ime.
---
It's mostly warriors who need strath live for righteous orbs for crusader enchants. And most warriors who reserve orbs rely on taking advantage of (the dwindling) people who need quests completed, not people who need items.
---
Funny part is, when the tanks need quests completed too, they'll still try to reserve orbs at everyone else's time and expense.
---
while TBC raiding is definately many time harder than vanilla raiding... it's still a complete joke compared to modern mythic ( or even heroic).
---
raids will be cleared the day they come out ( +/- the level'ing time for the first raid),  every PvE'er and their mother will be leatherworking, you'll see tons of warlock, next to no mage, 2v2's will be filled with Dru + hunt/rog/war ...
---
legion is the first expansion that actually gave PvE'er something to do after their weekly raid clear.
---
Not really etiquette if people are being asshats. Just leave
---
When you upload logs you could mark them as private, to hide info.  
---
If someone else uploaded this and they are public - you can't do anything.
---
It increases the damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to X
---
Do ur ony attunement IMO too many people hit 60 then have to spend hours tryong to fjnd groups for that chain, it starts in LBRS and leads to several classes bis items through a long quest chain worth plenty of xp.
---
The bard in the Witcher sings toss a coin to your witcher, so I started tossing coin to mages and wrote a little poem to go with it. Judging by the responses hear I could salt all of the roads in the Midwest this winter.

If you want to leave a dungeon early, just be an asshat so people are happy you leave :P
---
It wasn’t the supervisor these are special AI machine learning bots!
---
I could think of one or two valid scenario. Like when you left the guild saying that want to take a break from WoW, but actually you are raiding with another guild)
---
&gt;I'm not denying it
---
&gt;But don't come here complain that there's nothing to do.
---
sounds like you are denying it....
---
Agreed. Such a comment is just about as useful to discussion as “I’m sure you hate the grocery stores” hehe
---
I refuse to join orb res groups.
---
The tank's time is not more valuable than mine. Don't care that they're less in demand, I'm not going to literally pay someone to perform their role just so I can play the game.
---
I would rather just go level my alt than run an orb res group.
---
&gt; I know exactly what all of this is really about, and the irony is sweet. The amount of time the Horde wasted by ganking my guild alone
---
Your entire point seems to be self-centered spite. 
---
Rude. And stupid.
---
I have a feeling we're getting the EQ tlp treatment.
---
They're a "are the dps and healer present?" checks because you need some cc and single target burst that shit down before they melt the group.
---
Congrats, bud. My roommate has been after that weapon for a couple months now. Send an me of your luck his way please.
---
Get rekt pleb
---
If they already have a more powerful slow effect applied it will not show up.  Not a shaman myself, but my warrior hamstring will get overridden by FS, and if there is a FS on a player or mob hamstring does not appear.
---
Very true, it was mostly Vanilla private servers.. probably because the leveling questing experience is much longer and richer in Vanilla. You are still going to see an up-to-date ck in subs if you release TBC and keep the Vanilla experience for leveling
---
Its not about that.  Its about reservations on items, people selling tank services, pug ony, pug mc, warriors in full leather gear, aoe farming most instances, most warriors tanking in 2h fury, etc.
---
Thats not how people played vanilla.
---
Love you
---
Lol
---
Ok boomer
---
I will be. Just citing personal experience playing a lock in pservers and now classic . When the locks focus on pure SP we are below mages in total dps . When we started stacking crit our dps is above mages for the overall instance and some fights we parse way higher.
---
We had this drop and no one wanted it. The other tank took it just to mess around with. I hate when stuff drips no one can use.
---
Calling bullshit
---
It should be the other way around
---
the only reason to relive wow was world pvp
---
&gt;you guys have marksmen in the tower pummeling the players backdooring in as is.
---
wtf are you talking about, you can go up the backdoor and jump on the ledge on the side to enter the tower without ever getting hit by the archers.
---
Nifty + Cloaking into a Gnomish Mind Control Cap as an opener on a group. Allso I'm a mage, so yeah fun times :)
---
Except no one is "LF Raid geared mage live strat".
---
They are looking for a tank, raid geared or not. They can grab any dps they want, the essential part of the group is the tank. If you are doing strat as a way to make money as a raid geared mage you are wasting your time.
---
My main is 60 undead mage
---
Ah, you're almost certainly right. I know nothing about fury wars.
---
I just checked on the 1.12.1 client, and it does not work like it does in classic.
---
Uh, dismount hut? Not that it dismounts anymore but that is absolutely a major choke.
---
Updoot for useful information.
---
I guess my thought was if they were going to follow the natural blizz release there would be no such thing as "a fresh TBC server"
---
I know right? Its like they never even heard of honor
---
you can farm Mara for ghost mushrooms or just farm routs in felwood/other zones
---
I believe there's a large percentage of the community that believe TBC was the only good expansion, and some say it was better than classic (not an opinion shared by me)
---
That’s exactly my point; If I’m wasting my time just as much as a tank is and making the tanks runs go faster and smoother then I’ve got just as much of a claim on the first orb that they do. I’m not gonna join a group unless that’s made clear in the start and I’m not gonna bitch about it because everyone can do whatever they want; I just communicate my position and if they agree we go and if not we move on. Simple as that. I’m just demonstrating that there exists scenarios where the tank doesn’t deserve it more than a dps.
---
To me it doesn't make any sense to use exclusively ban waves . It does make sense to use waves on spotting cheaters with technology but why would you not also add individual bans from reports ?
---
Eh, I respectfully disagree. I prefer the wooden naturalistic look. But Ironforge is definitely awesome.
---
Posting about doesn't do a thing. Report them, then blizzard has to find a way to confirm, detect, and break the bot. Which usually means a ban wave. Going through individual accounts is entirely pointless and spamming here won't do a thing about it.
---
That's because GMs on private servers had the power to ban people. If you are a GM for blizzard you have to send your report and then after the person might get banned based on your report. When I used to be a GM for Blizzard a long time ago we couldn't even view the person we reported.
---
GMs on a private server such as Lights Hope were the judge, jury, and executioner. When you report a botter they move them around or teleport them to a room with nothing in it to see how you react. 99% of the times they ban the bot that doesn't react at all in the room.
---
Why wouldn’t they allow that? That’s how it worked back in the day when TBC was first released.
---
It's more like 10 coffees to go here in Germany or around 6 in a cafe
---
quest givers inside of houses,  and in oddball areas
---
Tanks are not rare at all. Run any strath ud, ubrs rend, brd arena/anger and you'll quickly notice how you get too many offers from warriors. Anyone who agrees to allowing any tank reserving any orbs is actively artificially creating this shortage until one side bites. It's a classic mexican standoff.
---
Some sports team subreddits are just as bad
---
What's your combat log say?
---
Man if I pick up on more goddamn unadorned seal...
---
are there really that many botters on classic?
---
So I should be good since I use questie?
---
It wont split. Those who will still be playing once TBC comes out are the hardcore crowd and they wont stay  behind to do naxx forever and ever.
---
Maybe you just didn't notice, for my part online communities have been really toxic ever since the original xbox took online gaming to the standard it is today.
---
You right. I take that back. As long as they provide a /value/ oriented product for the consumer I don't see why fuck capitalism.
---
I think it falls in between people who like the grind in vanilla and people who like the streamlined and more skill based gameplay in wotlk.
---
I'm sure the hype and players will be there once it gets official servers.
---
WOAH, none of your warriors wanted deathbringer?? Its insane even for non orcs, ally included. 
---
RIP
---
Find the reddit for your server and have alliance farm him til broken
---
If tanks aren't rare at all why are you here complaining about them reserving orbs? Just find the next super common tank wanting to tank a dungeon for you with nothing in return for them! Should be super easy if what you're saying is true, but it's quite obviously not.
---
&gt; Lmao alliance can literally kill drek in 5 mins
---
Yeah if literally no Horde ever defends
---
You can say you do amazing things on the internet all you want. But the fact you are rallying against the best way for the most people to be successful in the history of the world just tells people with common sense that you couldn't succeed in that system and are now mad at it.
---
1) World becomes smaller.
---
2) Immersion. When you are forced to run for 40 levels (druid and shaman get running form earlier) you feel like you are actually part of huge world. Getting mounts (and some people will not get them at 40 and will not get epic mount at 60) changes it a bit, but you already think about this world as big. And lack of option to travel in 3 directions also adds to it since mountains and everything like this matters. Quite honestly current wow world feels like too small because I can fly all over it so fast.
---
3) WPvP is dead. You just fly past zones in safe mode, you don't need to protect FPs, hell, even strategy of catching opposing faction at fp during world boss spawns. Also less random meetings. All you get left is meeting near dungeon entrance (no meeting on way to them) and major city raids (harder to provoke respnose since nobody gives a damn about FPs, you can't attack invaders on their way to your capital).
---
4) Lowbie ganking actually becomes even worse with high level gankers just howering above leveling zones and droping on everybody they can see.
---
How is it possible to "bully somebody into accepting anything in their groups'?
---
If you don't want to be in a group you just leave.
---
What's the issue you're experiencing?
---
You screw ever Druid and Pally in there. I hope it was a pug
---
If you are a rogue heard that mining in Silithus is good gold. Rich ooze covered thorium veins underground and sneak past all the elite bugs
---
Oh Im lvl 49 so I haven't seen a lot of the raid drama yet. Cant comment on that. Once WSG hit Ive just been enjoying my lvl advantage for a bit and grinding out the sentinels rep.
---
Exactly, and in the time you save looking for a tank you can easily farm the gold for an orb of your own. It's a win-win situation for everyone
---
For sure! And they have every right to bribe a tank to do that. But if a tank wants to maximize their return on time investment a case can be made for them to bring at least one well geared mage to make the trash packs go faster, with the understanding that they’re all there to do multiple runs. If a tank wants to spend 4 hours farming righteous orbs they’re going to get way more of them running with a geared healer + mage aoe clearing the instance 6-8 times than they’d get running with dps who are just there to finish quests, forming multiple groups, waiting for people to arrive, etc. you’d be lucky to clear 3 times with newly formed undergearwd groups in that time span and I’ve been able to clear twice per hour with two competent dps and geared tanks and healers. That’s 5 more instances, more chances at the 4-5 orb per run/chances to mitigate the runs that yield 0 orbs. So if you’re a tank who’s only running it for orbs it makes more sense for you to get over yourself and roll with the other people who don’t need anything but are fast to clear than it does to go through groups of green wearing dps who only want 1 run for quests.
---
Screenshots or it didn't happen
---
I'm exactly the same. Will quit wow for sure if tbc comes but would love classic +
---
Bots have been a thing for over 15 years. Why do you act like a reddit post is gonna suddenly change anything?
---
Thanks!  Question: is it ever really worth casting rain of fire?  Seems underwhelming compared to hellfire and poor in terms of mana efficiency.  Maybe for low hp trash?
---
I'm still leveling my lock (46 atm) and am honestly tempted to take it off my bars.
---
Also added Home Assistant automation for running scripts if you are into that stuff..
---
I use mine currently to have my Alexa's announce when the BG Queue is ready.
---
I love when people act like it isn't in Blizzard's best interest to ban them.
---
You complaining about it isn't going to make them do a thing that they **want** to do any faster.
---
&gt;In 2.0 tbc your naxx epics were actually better than most of t4.
---
No, they really weren't. But you could raid T4 with Naxx epics instead of HC Blues.
---
It's generally cast time/3.5 times your spell power.
---
Doesn't really matter that much anymore. Now we just mow horde at the start and they never seem to recover.
---
Ez honor.
---
Guild chat mainly...
---
yeah i really miss getting crit for 900 damage from Lupos every 5 seconds while wearing full plate armor.
---
I love priests and am one myself but leveling them is kinda boring too but also very good. But you just wand most of the time. I would always recommend priests because I love them so much but if you want to PvP paladins are excellent healers there. Priests of course also but way squisher
---
The issue with this excuse is bots are fucking up the economy every single day. Saying they always have banned in waves causes two issues, first it means they can be silent for any length of time and you can always say there's a wave incoming and second it doesn't undo or mitigate the damage being caused in the meantime.
---
? He has no responsibility to change his point so that it better fits your point.
---
Yes. Learn pvp and you won't have to run premades to beat pugs :-)
---
Mods: "How can we improve the sub"
---
Everyone: "Stop the Facebook posts"
---
Mods: allow this shit 24/7
---
nicely executed and awesome music choice too :p tho idk about that english cover
---
I queued specific last night and it worked fine. Not sure of why it wouldn’t
---
you need them for the zg enchants though..
---
Imagine being in a raid with 0 warriors
---
Reddit mods are such fucking losers who put stupid rules in place so they can feel special. On every single subreddit. Change my mind.
---
Rain of Fire if you don't trust your mages to nova, your tanks to hold aggro, or your healers to heal you.
---
&gt;Also chance to hit % was a huge reason why naxx gear was still relevant. They didn't make the conversion from % -&gt; hit rating until a later patch so in 2.0 1% hit at lvl 60 was 1% hit at lvl 70. 
---
this is incorrect.  
---
The % to rating conversion (Combat Rating System) was implemented with patch 2.0.1 which happened 1 month before TBC went live.
---
You may be overthinking the situation.  Most world quests are solo'able by design so you are just along to enjoy the ride.  Pretty much any class including your mage will probably be fine once she has a pet to tank with.   If you really want to sync up try rolling a hunter yourself,  there isn't much out there 2 hunters can't handle.
---
It's not intended for raids. See: you can't queue as a group. You're just running premades because you get shit on otherwise because you're bad at pvp :-(
---
How can you stand all those numbers on your gear
---
It doesn't matter if you like it or don't, if they advertise truthfully then you don't have to join that group. I play a druid so I've tanked a fair bit in 5 mans, whenever I see some salty cunt bring it up like I'm doing a disservice, I just point out that I said orbs res on the lfg ad. Had someone get salty over me ressing runes after 9 of them dropped in scholo a couple weeks ago, like level a tank then.
---
So what you're saying is that we have less support now because there are less subscribers? Seems to make sense to me.
---
Preferably just clone your character like the PTR.
---
GL looking 4 dat carry?
---
Burning Crusade is a given.  Classic+ is one of the dumbest ideas the community has came up with in a long time. 
---
Continuing on in BC with my level 60 is also a given.
---
What is unclear is what they will do with Classic.  If they don’t leave level 60 servers then we’ll be in the same boat of people wanting Classic back.  But keeping level 60 servers will fragment the population with some staying level 60 and some moving on to BC.
---
Yeah but this doesn't fix the botting problem, which has other repercussions aside from the honor farming.
---
I did pally lock with my wife. We both get free mounts, triple value from auras, can AoE or single target... value town!!
---
Plus you both have no movespeed, so you both go slow. 
---
I’d honestly download some addons and set her UI up for her, so it’s the easiest/most accessible it can possibly be. 
---
My Wife has a much easier time playing when she can click stuff and it works (auto loot, auto sell Junk, auto repair, etc...) 
---
I also used dominos for ease of keybinding
---
The dramatic IP change can cause an instant ban if reported
---
lol that 1% enchant on lionheart Helm feels Bad man
---
You should be picking up the crossbow anywho.
---
It's a lot the same but honestly they should've left the spell power changes for later and left the debuff spots alone. Biggest changes that made classes scale too hard and raids far too easy
---
So lying :( That's just one reason. And not a valid scenario.
---

Yikes NE priest with Aurastone haha

It's not in their best interest. Blizzard just needs to keep the servers up.
---
Happy cake day and gl on your twink!
---
I remember at 70 my guild decided to 25 man AQ40 with no knowledge of the raid (thinking it would be a joke). We had some issues figuring out the mechanics but it wasnt too bad until Cthun. 1st attempt we all ran in together and were nuked by chain lightning. 2nd attempt we got in correct but had no idea about what we were doing and were killing the wrong tentacles. I am sure that most know the fight by now, but BT/Hyjal geared 70s wiped in there is my main point here. 
---
The mechanics are not that hard - but your raid better listen when those fights are being explained or it will be gg
---
I think the problem is people have very different ideas about what Classic+ is.
---
I for one would love a "TBC/WotLK+". Where we go on to TBC so the devs can reuse the content that a lot of people liked, but change it in key areas. For example, making sure the old world is still relevant despite Outland and Northrend being accesible. Making sure the Dungeon finder is never introduced in WotLK. Flying is fine in Outland imo, Cata was the problem, when Flying in every single zone in the game became possible. For me the optimal version of WoW is progressing up to WotLK with changes to the things that were garbage, and then making NEW content after WotLK. I.e, not doing Cata. 
---
But everyone has a different version of what is optimal, so they're fucked if they do Classic+, because eventually they'll introduce something half the population loves, and something half the population hates.
---
THANK YOU!
---
You will get 150 first aid just questing to 15
---
No. Because the community is trash
---
My guild was getting roflstomped in MC at this time if I remember right.
---
Doing the lords work.
---
+atk speed actually scales better than the +8 strength. Especially with slower weapons like DB.
---
Go play retail if you want content shoved down your throat
---
Yes, you are not counting the # of instances you are entering. There is no wow conspiracy where just your account can only enter 2.
---
I keep seeing "classic+"
---
But I'm not 100% sure what that means. Mind helping a guy out? Thanks!
---
You are wrong.  [Read this article from 2004.](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/blizzard-entertainment-announces-world-of-warcraft-street-date-november-23-2004)
---
They will never do anything. Blizzard cares more about botters and multiboxers than people who call out their BS like Ion giving the live game an older AV, while withholding it from Classic. Activision Blizzard simply wants stupid customers. They don't care about the old customers. They want sub 75 IQ people who watch influencers, who believe in fake hype, viewbotted streams and who call a vastly changed Classic "no changes". They are already using those influencers to trash their changed classic while hyping up the next expansion.
---
They wanted Classic to fail. Botters helps that fail, multiboxers helps that fail. The only reason they made Classic was to get people on the modern game. The old AV put into the modern game that Ion withheld from classic should scream that fact to you. The fact that the same clown is in charge of both games is a joke.
---
Prot paladin is nuts on levelling. At least it was for me, i tanked spellcleave groups so ot was quite fast. Ret is best for solo, prot is best if you can group. Since i levelled at start i always had  group.
---
10 more levelsssss. Already have all my bis boes including the only svbb ive ever seen on thalnos. 39s are my jam.
---
Frostbite! I prefer the slower off hands to not chew up as many flurry procs.
---
I just wanna get my truefaith vestments man.
---
Holy shit this is probably my favourite feedback I've recieve - thank you so much! That's the goal, were aware we've got lots of kinks to work out but we're gonna go keep making videos and trying our absolute best till we perfect it :)
---
Nature protection pots. 1 stranglekelp + 1 liferoot = supa dupa cheap.
---
We don't need literal 24/7 gank squads and people camping FPs to make the world feel dangerous. People will often fight each other without that. Just not when the other player can literally fly off whenever he pleases a la flying mounts.
---
Reminds me of botw
---
Short version: Your rank is actually a point system called RP. There's 5k RP between each rank(except rank 1-2-3). Your bracket determines how much RP you get. For bracket 11 you get between 9-10k RP per week depending on where in the bracket you are. You lose 20% of current RP per week(called decay) which is before your weekly gain. With only br11 it could take you easily 8 weeks to get r11
---
logged in a few seconds ago and 1 bot was back farming again :(
---
o7 good work soldier
---
Indeed Omnibar with OmniCC
---
&gt;A tanks time is not more valuable.
---
By the universal law of supply and demand, it quite literally is. That's where your main misunderstanding is and why you're wrong on this.
---
It won’t be. The only parts of BWL “harder“ than MC are Razorgore, Chrommagus and Nef, and people deal so much dps at this point that Chrom and Nef will probably just be brute forced.
---
Even in Naxx numbers checks could be met by MC pugs, to say nothing of people actually in AQ gear.
---
If you’re looking for challenging raids, you won’t find them here. The hardest things get is around Karazhan level.
---
fantastic job with the bots! Btw whats the title of the song :)?
---
Good thing alliance can easily solo cap the horde base.
---
You also take like 1k damage worth of arrow damage if you want to avoid pulling any extra NPCs. You also risk dismounting when pulling the graveyard NPCs away from the archers.
---
Horse archers are known to de-aggro and have poor attack lines. Do alliance not have a similar experience just running to horde relief hut?
---
Just to let you know most bots can hearth, repair, and get to back where they need to be. Gl with that.
---
Thank you so much! Glad to get some good criticism. My friend has pointed out recently that actually he curses way too much when he doesn't know what to say so he's been putting an effort into cutting back on it. Though we write general outlines for our episodes beforehand the dialogue is almost all completely improvised. Which is also why the jokes really drag on
---
I suggest reading comprehension. I said the population difference in TBC would be much worse than now and favor Horde. 
---
As far as MT's for Arena? People like Reckful ran human rogue for a reason. Perception is very strong in Arena. Not so much in BG's. People who play mainly Arena don't care about any of the things you mentioned. They don't care about raids other than to get a few items, they don't care about BG's or queues because they consider that beneath them. They only want a high rating/number in a minigame. Do you see Reckful in Classic? Nope, because it has no number that he can point to. Competitive people don't give a single f@%\^ about Classic WoW other than streaming it for money. Those people also stream arena at night.
---
He should start a YouTube so I can see how he manages everything lol. Some fresh advice would be swell.
---
We have killed Ony every week since the beginning of October. This was the first Deathbringer our guild has seen. Good luck! It will drop eventually
---
ez
---
How does the ilvl and performance work in Warcraft Logs? My best has been 75.8 and looks purple, is that compared against every other lock in Classic or is that compared with people of the same ilvl that i've?
---
That's just your opinion. I like to read these kinds of posts more than the ones complaining. Fight me.
---
It is definitely this, and horde is just now starting to use the backdoor, mostly to catch up to aid station or to ninja cap it. And there are hardly ever any ally there. I've capped the gy solo as a hunter several times.
---
You know what the easiest example of horde trying harder is, though? The disparity in turning. I've been in well over 100 games, and I've seen the alliance tree dude like 3 times total, all after horde already had rock boy
---
If you're going to simplify a bulleted list of examples to "private servers were better than Classic" then you arent having an honest discussion anyways.
---
You gave a possibly false anecdote about being banned from a private server for arguing on Discord, and then told OP he should be happy for his freedom to make a post like this
---
But that's WoW. The gear treadmill is part of the entire games DNA, if you stop the treadmill then the illusion of "Now we can finally play the game!" falls apart. The grind *is* the game.
---
Classic+ means creating new content from scrapped plans in vanilla like finishing and releasing zones like Mount Hyjal and planned raids like 40man Karazhan.
---
What are you talking about 1/3 of my runs have had zero orbs
---
Of course it’s made up for 1/3 of my runs having 4 orbs
---
sure but im pulling 50 mobs, how am i supposed to put it on all of them? :D
---
God dam that would be fucking amazing.
---
Zero chance of them doing that though lol
---
You are free to believe that, but you are wrong.
---
Solving a game has a strict mathematical definition, and WoW is not solvable.
---
On the horde side I've since adjusted my schedule to queue for AV at night/morning. Queues are shorter, arathi fire ele's are usually uncontested, and less premades to deal with. Playing during prime time or even in the afternoons on the weekends is cancer.
---
I played alliance in vanilla so this has been an interesting experience to say the least.
---
&gt;They died usually either through voluntary shutdown because Classic or through a new FRESH being announced.
---
I find it hilarious that most people don't want the TBC gear reset because "muh ebigs" while they flock to FRESH like ants on honey.
---
Ok thanks!
---
You mean the same thing you can?
---
It's okay if you can't grasp the sentence. 
---
Just play optimally or premade to go casual
---
Uh no you don't? You need to be friendly with zandalar and have a primal hakari idol and your classes voodoo doll.
---
the title’s a little unclear, this is how you get PAST 150
---
I'd level as disc priest with her until 40, then switch to shadow.
---
And on those servers were some seriously geared people. 
---
Somebody is gonna get owned no matter how you to try to balance the launch, because Alliance will want their Shaman and Horde will want their Paladins. They didn’t get a level boost to 60 when TBC launched, they had to start over.
---
Ideally they’ll keep Classic as a separate game, but create TBC server copies for each realm (like “Atiesh TBC” for instance) where TBC progression continues and there’s no massive hole of characters between level 1 and level 60 on launch day.
---
The key is to go between the first support log of the roof and the side wall of the entrance, you will not get dismounted and the protection of the support log ensures you will not fall down the bluff!  
---
Source: My home town
---
&gt; it was the players creating all the "if you want to pvp you have to roll horde" media content.
---
It was a handful of "content creators". You're coming across like you're just an angry Alliance player happy to eat shit if it means the Horde have to smell your breath. 
---
&gt; Horde players made their bed. Time to sleep in it.
---
So not players per se, specifically Horde players, deserve a flawed game because they rolled Horde.
---
What are you doing in DME? I've just been killing the 8 lasher packs, one or two solo satyrs, checking for the two courtyard books, and picking any courtyard herbs. Is there something else in DME I could be doing that's better use of my time?
---
Enough that they go oom in mc while using Mana pots/runes?
---
&lt;Five FX&gt; can suck a fat one
---
&gt; They may allow you to keep your Classic characters on a non-progressing server of sorts but absolutely no way they will allow Naxx geared 60s on a fresh Tbc server.
---
Care to elaborate the thoughts of what I am guessing is a window licker?
---
You mean you can do the whole of Shadowfang Keep in 3 pulls?
---
He's not MAKING ANY POINT.
---
He states "flying was the biggest mistake Blizzard made" without providing any reason.
---
So we assume his reasoning is the same as every moron out there, "flying killed wpvp" which isn't true at all, like Classic just demonstrated.
---
But, if his reasoning is different he's free to tell us so.
---
Where the hell did I ask him to change his point? Can you even logic?
---
His guide has an addendum re: the nuances of imp drain soul. I found it useful for contributing to my sustainability while leveling, but then I'd begin channeling a rank1 drain soul several seconds before the mob's death.
---
but then I can't afk farm AV when I'm at work :/
---
Shortage of tanks is not based on supply or demand. Overflow of tanks in ubrs rend, brd arena/anger, strath ud runs confirm this. Shortage has more to do with spillover culture and the gullible on the server allowing tanks to reserve even 1 orb. This was never a thing or a problem in vanilla WoW, even though in classic you have 50 million more players rolling warriors. I, and many other warriors like me, tanked that shit for an equal chance at an orb in vanilla.
---
We don't have that now and we don't have flying mounts. 
---
That was because Blizzard added Honor a whole month before releasing battlegrounds. 
---
You know this.
---
Anyone having a good template/URL i can copy for ElvUi?

Sounds like you are making it a shitty experience for her. You are only allowing her to experience the game babysitted by you. If she ever goes out and do something alone she will have an incredibly warped view of how to play. 
---
Let her play alone, fail and overcome obstacles. Babysitting and guiding is the absolute worst way to show someone a game.
---
She doesn't need you.
---
Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans didn't exist until Cata iirc
---
Hide of the Wild
---
Believe me we’re not any more organized and I imagine it’s just as dumb as what you hear on your side at the start of matches. We just have more incentive to defend and farm rep/honor in a longer match since we have to wait 20+ minutes to get in the BG.
---
Av was zergable in vanilla. Kill the first officer cap closest Gy and two towers and it was over in 8-10 minutes
---
Healers and DPS are dime a dozen. 
---
There's a reason the common refrain in LFG is "LF1M Tank".
---
What does wanding mean? I’m going to level an warlock alt and guides explain wanding techniques. Is that not just quipping a wand in primary then white hitting? Or am i missing something casters do?
---
oh shit are we evolving a new generation of super bot?
---
This 100%
---
"Personal experience," aka the bane of all good testing and simming.  
---
Warlocks are entirely too streaky in this phase to make the kind of statements you're making without deep dives into logs.  
---
You can literally get resisted 35% of the time in a 40 second boss fight, or you can have 35% crits with 5% resists in the same fight next week. 
---
For now, you have to trust the math.  It's not super complicated math.
---
Skul took us about half a day to farm 3 wands. Mind Vision ftw.

---
Well said - Wow is, at its heart, a social game. Find your niche, whether that's playing with try hards and winning every bg or having a fun Dungeon run with some random people from across the land.
---
Some people seemingly tend to forget that both can exist, and coexist at that. No need for forcing people to play how you want, or accept you for doing so yourself
---
You're getting downvoted for being rude, but your point is true. I dont blame the mod in this thread, he is simply doing his job, and good on you /u/ but the fact remains that the people above this mod should communicate better for the mods and the community. Looks really bad that their own mods dont know why sketchy, blizzard-supporting rules are being enforced.
---
40g every few runs would take well over 1 hour, so again.. No incentive.
---
Agree that there are a lot of QoL things that are not fun, but have you ever tried to solo tribute runs? Even with a proper spec (that's useless for any other situation, improved FD is 100% necessary for it and nowhere else) it's extremely hard, and basically impossible to do efficiently, ie 4 runs/hr. Too much rng with pats, FD resisting even with the right spec. Anyone claiming that hunters can make 150g/hr is talking out their ass, to do that you'd need to finish 3 runs, get a TER every drop, and find a buyer for each, within the hour. In the end, for most people trying to do it, it won't be much more g/hr, or nearly as efficient, as solo mara runs.
---
Point being--if you can solo DMN then you deserve all the gold lol
---
&gt; Plus you don’t get much of the min-max mentality bullshit we have on WoW
---
I guess you've never ever done trials such as vMoS and vHoF.
---
I wonder how many guilds stuck around, or will stick around, to get Atiesh and the like. Kinda of something I want to do or help someone do just for fun
---
You could take this path https://streamable.com/aryzk
---
but not this one https://streamable.com/domd5
---
Exactly what I did to farm up wands for myself and a couple warlock guidies.
---
Not on private doesn't mean not in Vanilla. It's worked since at least retail WotLK. Honestly can't say anything about earlier since I haven't done AV on retail since then because it's so garbage.
---
Hi, /u/Seith180
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/egvgt6/can_anyone_explain_why_this_happens/). 
---
not doubting you, but do you have source?
---
Right? There isn’t some elite task force backdooring offense every game. It’s a bunch of sick rankers in mid getting pissy about leechers, and people half afking/existing past balinda but before the bridge.
---
There is both. On rankings for an encounter Parse % is for everyone and ilvl % is for same ilvl.
---
When viewing your profile you can toggle which shows.
---
&gt;Now, before you say “roll on pve server”, I do enjoy pvp and fighting opposite faction which is similar level is very fun
---
literally pve servers.  be unflagged, find someone your level, decide you want to fight eachother and flag up.
---
You're blaming the players for somehow preventing Blizzard form policing their own property.
---
What does the bottom of a boot taste like? Does it depend what mastah last walked through or is it a neutral flavor like Artificial Banana?
---
For those of you not in the know; this means he has to pluck the feathers off some pheasants (think smaller turkey, game hen, etc.) to presumably prepare for a meal. 
---
This happens when you hunt or someone hunts for you.
---
Because no prio list leads to chaos. It may not be the meta. But it’s how we work. The mage blade being on our list is actually a compromise with spell casters so that healers don’t roll on the choker of the fire lord. Our class leaders got together and figured out a good compromise between each class so that each class has a fair chance at some loot. Mageblade is one of the best healing weapons for paladins for several phases. I want to say until AQ. Although I won’t say I’m exactly remembering that right. I don’t have a loot list in front of me at the moment. 
---
On the case of aurastone. It really hasn’t been a issue. I think we are down to one priest who still needs the eye. So usually they just pass on it. 
---
While our guild is by no means a bleeding edge of raid progression. We aren’t exactly a casual guild either. We have two raid groups with current content on farm. Down to 2.5-3 hours for a double MC/Ony night. We are close to getting our first hand of rag on our own merits without having to do shady and unreliable deals with other guilds. Oh wait. Hand of rag sucks for progression. So do ret pallys, which we have one each for our raid groups. 
---
We decided to play for fun. Not to burn ourselves out by nitpicking over  little loot details. 
---
Sorry about the rant. Just annoys me that the prevailing thought is there is only two ways to play WoW. Either as a hardcore raiding progression guild that tries to theory craft the crap out of the game or a super casual guild who can’t even get a ony kill in. There are gradients between the two.
---
Old Outland looked kinda sick tbh. It was more in line with the Classic style.
---
Never say never. Classic was "zero chance" for years.
---
Ors did the + pretty well from what I've heard
---
Horde mass defend towers, often with 20+ so you can't really capture towers if they decide to not let you and delay their win.
---
It's so hard to fight the brainwashing that has happened in America over the last couple of generations. America used to be THE country of individualism and the idea of thinking for yourself and making up your own mind about things. People from around the world praised America and Americans for not taking shit from their government and for standing up for human rights. Now we just worship the almighty dollar at the expense of everything else.
---
First half of AQ is easy, last 4 bosses (2 of which are optional) are much more challenging.
---
Sooo defend when you see horde use this strategy? They're literally bottlenecked fish in a barrel if just a handful of allies port back
---
I like it. I dump on mages as a lock, and our mages are real good. I also consistently dumped on meters on private servers but for some reason people didn't believe me when I said this prior to classic launch. Warlocks are god tier DPS for basically the entirety of classic if you stack Shadow Wrath spellpower gear.
---
&gt;World becomes smaller.
---
You can make the same statement even for current mounts. Any speed increase makes the world smaller.
---
Still you get flying only at max level, any exploration you do before that is on the ground.
---
&gt;Immersion. When you are forced to run for 40 levels (druid and shaman get running form earlier) you feel like you are actually part of huge world. Getting mounts (and some people will not get them at 40 and will not get epic mount at 60) changes it a bit, but you already think about this world as big. And lack of option to travel in 3 directions also adds to it since mountains and everything like this matters. Quite honestly current wow world feels like too small because I can fly all over it so fast.
---
You can still get the very same sense of exploration, since, as I stated before you get flying at max lvl. So you get to immerse yourself in the world while leveling up, and to get actual shit done in a timely fashion at max lvl.
---
&gt;WPvP is dead. You just fly past zones in safe mode, you don't need to protect FPs, hell, even strategy of catching opposing faction at fp during world boss spawns. Also less random meetings. All you get left is meeting near dungeon entrance (no meeting on way to them) and major city raids (harder to provoke respnose since nobody gives a damn about FPs, you can't attack invaders on their way to your capital).
---
WPvP is dead, right now, on Classic. I play Alliance in a 70% Horde majority pvp server. They are more than double our numbers. I've been ganked exactly TWICE since BGs are out. I could be playing PvE for all that matters now. It was a massive gankfest before, 20minutes to go from Thorium Point to UBRS. Now? you could do that naked without a mount.  
---
Big outdoor PvP battles? Gone. Flypoint ganking? Gone. Ironforge Raids? haven't had one in weeks.
---
BGs killed WPvP. Flying mounts had nothing to do with that. We are saying this for years, I'm glad Classic proved it.
---
&gt;Lowbie ganking actually becomes even worse with high level gankers just howering above leveling zones and droping on everybody they can see.
---
Sure, this point is valid. Still if I ride into Thousand Needles on a 100% mount there isn't much lowbies can do to avoid being UnstoppableForced in the face.
---
Other way around, the “play what you want” people can’t get into groups. They’re annoyed that min-maxers don’t allow the bottom-ranking specs into groups, and people often post or comment guilting or shaming those min-maxers.
---
How is Twin Emps a gear check?
---
private servers ran on the official 1.12.1 client, and the maps was exactly the same as it was in vanilla.
---
For scripted content, sure it will be off. But the map is identical
---
Iceblood tower chokepoint, galv is harder than balinda, horde towers much harder to defend than bunkers, etc. etc.
---
Honestly stop giving a shit. I run groups and do RR and all BoEs and patterns are needed by everyone. It's good cash usually. There is always someone who will bitch, just don't run with them.
---
All races have 5% stun resist as a base so Orcs have 30%. But it does feel like 80%
---
I don’t remember things being so cancerous the first time round. Shows how the mindset of people has changed over the years.
---
Yeah, having C+ of be of any decent quality (offering brand new features and content without departing from the classic feel and esthetic) is such a long shot given how all new content has been since patch 3.3 onward. There’s definitely been some good points along the way but it’s clear that the departure of 90% of the original WoW team and Metzen being gone took its toll on the games quality and what made it special. The new devs just really don’t have the same ability to create new content that feels anywhere as good as vanilla through wrath.
---
The point of my post is I disagree with the assertion it's a supply/demand thing. The supply is high. It's based on culture and nothing more. The less suckers there are, the more this problem goes away.
---
One of my guildies was smeared on our server's subreddit with fake screenshots. They were later proven to be fake.
---
Imagine thinking screenshots are proof.
---
Thats the exact opposite of reality though...
---
 *Applying dots will tag a mob.* 
---
How I wish this was true, the first 20-25 levels at launch were a complete nightmare.
---
This is simply awesome, great job!
---
A quick question: when was Eye of Kilrogg fixed? Last time i've tried it still transferred aggro to me, rather annoying, and practically rendering the spell useless - definitely not like in Vanilla... -.-
---
Eh, by AQ40 / Naxx it started getting hard to justify bringing some classes in vanilla. My guild started benching lots of rogues and hunters, for example.
---
They have stated in interviews that they are now in the business of vanilla for good. So if they double back on that and remove all the classic servers people will be pretty upset.
---
Only if they use Divine Intervention
---
Gnome anything is cool lol
---
Yeah but those bots use actual botting programs rather than auto hot key spam so you have to do it in waves otherwise the botter just reloads and restarts
---
Im leveling 2 alts right now. havent hited 52 yet, but in most popular EU realm I have never been camped by horde. every pvp fight is one I started. will be intresting once i hit plague lands to see if its like you said. 
---
O and about people using fap against you as mage. well yea. ofc they will othervise for example warr will just be kited to death. Using 1 pot doesnt mean he is using every consumable there is.
---
Fight club is going to tell you to use a slow OH lmao.
---
&gt; My friend said he’s get auto kicked all the time from AV because his gear wasn’t “good enough”.
---
Don’t think that’s possible bud
---
Literally never heard of that ever happening or seen it
---
Sorry I simply mean its easy to win 95% against pugs. You simply just leave against any premade and go for easy honor
---
What matters at the end is honor/hour, not wins/losses.
---
I thought hit cap for orcs with axes is 6%. Is there a reason why you decided to go up to 10%?
---
Lol you have a hunter rolling on all SP bops so they can shoot slightly harder arcane shots?  I'd be gone lmao
---
Got any data to support that?
---
derp
---
Your satisfaction satisfies me. Thank you.
---
Honor bots especially...
---
You're awesome, big props to the whole mod team. I wish blizz hired you for your communication skills
---
Why do ally’s on this subreddit act like all horde were doing the flight path ganking during phase 2? It’s probably less than 20% of the player base that did it and were trying to rank (including plenty of ally’s who were doing the same thing) but you act like anyone who plays horde was a camping asshole during phase 2.
---
Try questing in ungoro, feralas and winterspring. If you're horde, AOE kill in blasted lands.
---
Plaguelands in general are hell right now
---
Imaman Sheaman Suchaman
---
i saw that  Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn is best enchant for sholders but it requiers to have  exalted with argent dawn
---
how long does it take to get it ?
---
Would you say that a title is a simplification of a body of work? 
---
For example, a term paper may be titled "China's Manufacturing Sector Overtakes US", while the body of the paper expands on that topic greatly?
---
Would reducing the paper to the title be dishonest?
---
Thankfully not in my guild. Was a post here in the sub about two weeks ago. When I showed my guildys it, even the hunters were cringing.
---
They’re probably waiting for a banwave. You guys are so impatient
---
I disagree because if she’s anything like my girlfriend, she wants to play and be a team. Leveling to 30 is a LONG TIME for a non-gamer, and she’ll probably lose interest without cooperation along the way.
---
No one said there shouldn't be rules, just that the post from the screenshot isn't breaking any rules. The guy I was replying to just wants posts he doesn't like removed and that's not how it works, nor should it.
---
would also know more about that
---
I added a small note about how to tag as a warlock :)
---
Ret paly here. 
---
What did I just skim?
---
Funny enough, naxx has the best dps class spread. Mc bwl are fury rogue heavy, aq is caster heavy but naxx is balanced caster/melee representation. Just low hunters (2-3)
---
Will I get banned for using translator sites and typing in phrases that the other faction can understand? For example, I come across a hordie in ashenvale and so copy paste "Ä Ÿ À ßi ‡ Ÿ" in which means mak gora. Will I get banned for doing this?
---
You could poke around https://wago.io/ to get some templates to mess with.
---
[Here's](https://www.codepile.net/pile/Y2PaNl8b) my string if you just want to copy it over.
---
Yes, that's what I wrote. It explains to you why your analogy is dumb and unnecessary. If you still don't understand why your analogy added nothing to the conversation after two people have now explained it to you, I feel for you.
---
^ this guy actually played vanilla, what a rare sight here.
---
And to be fair, ZG is as hard as you want it to be. AFAIK no-priest Hakkar has still never been accomplished.
---
What level is needed for Ony quest?
---
&gt;You never see anyone in the world, everyone just flys and alt tabs.
---
Opposed to "you never see anyone in the world, everyone just sits near AV battlemaster".
---
Depending on language all code is one line of code, if you're a monster.
---
What about the Infernal and Doomguard? I remember being able to summon them in a low level area and watch then go haywire killing guards and low level players etc, last time I tried this they just kept despawning, this is surely a bug?
---
I wish it were every 2nd week.  Our guild has had a grand total of 4 drop clearing MC since last week of Sept.  Went on a 7 week spree without one for my eventual drop and are on a dry spell again now.
---
Meanwhile we've already had a binding and Eye of rag drop.
---
Eye of kilrogg was fixed very recently; you can see several threads about it in the past week or so by angry people wanting to "spell cleave" or pull tinkerer/rotgrip/whatever.
---
Personally I prefer the fixed eye (and advocated for it during beta when the spell was changed several times), as it is now actually useful as a scouting spell.
---
If you remove the backdoor, Alliance are hilariously favored. 
---
This sub has a very high concentration of petulant, reactive idiots.
---
The positivity we need...
---
It’s not about changing bots. It’s about reacting faster because BG Bots destroy a lot of pools atm
---
You do the Lord's work
---
55 for the Lbrs part, then u gotta go to ubrs, then ubrs again, then world dragons, then ubrs again full clear that time then ur done iirc.
---
I would start doing Arena-Anger-Golem runs which can be decent exp. Your pre BIS belt comes off an Arena boss, as well as 2nd BIS ring and then your 2nd BIS boots come off Golem boss. 
---
After that I'd probably focus on LBRS / Live Strat. You have 2 pre BIS items in each of those dungeons
---
I've been doing the same and currently 58. May as well get exp while farming the gear that you're going to spend time farming at 60 anyway
---
unfortunately... this is "working as intended". I will add it to the post in hopes of generating outrage.
---
Fishing is the hardest to detect as well. I used to do it in wrath/BC and found really secluded spots in the world. Took time for people even in my own guild to find out. It wasnt even the best gold either, but it was pretty damn safe.   
---
I decided not to risk anything with classic but I'm not going to lie and say I haven't done many hours of research into fishbotting for classic. I would rather not risk my main tho even tho it's relatively safe. Sad to see the market go so bad
---
Right but if you created the "hasn't picked up anything" function already, why wouldn't you have already implemented the "if not then hearthstone" piece of it?
---
find them on wowhead and click the ingame link button which will add it to your clipboard
---
We had a lot of good fury warriors experimenting with things like weaponskill stacking and slamspec, and by AQ40 rogue dps had fallen way behind.
---
Do you have a flurry axe?
---
I use the fury warrior dps spreadsheet on a certain warrior discord
---
Probably
---
This post is bad
---
Because I will be crit capped with buffs and consumes if I don’t wear more +hit gear.
---
Exactly. Working and studying dad here. One of the huge reasons I am investing in Classic is the hope that the hours that I put into my gear will not become just irrelevant in the future.   
---
I would really hope that they would do Classic+, not in terms of making more and more powerful gear but in terms of making more different set bonuses and stat combinations one could use and more different and interesting weapon effects. Basically even more customisation and diversity when it comes to gear choices.
---
I found it pretty difficult to keep high HP/MP at higher levels, this seems to be the usual, that was with ~250 shadow power 45+, so heals etc are all more efficient.
---
eventually you get the point where you're just using corruption + CoA and even that can't sustain you indefinitely with DL. 
---
at 55 i swapped to Soul link/-interruption on drainlife, as it gave an extra 3% damage and mitigation with soullink, which seemed to solve that problem somewhat (needed to heal pet here and there still though).
---
also helps you a lot more in dungeons as you can SB spam rather than throw up dots (though if you are in that position, your dots are basically just as strong if you have a succu out, stronger even).
---
Not true at all. I farm silithus heavily on whitemane and while it’s very competitive, once you get a timer chances are good you can do nab the next and so on. It takes some patience and luck and a chunk of rng. Honestly if you have the time, I find lotus farming to be an incredibly effective gold farm.
---
Honorbuddy and WoWglider were truly amazing. Almost every bot now is a simple waypoint bot. Makes me sad that none are being banned but I'm hoping Blizzard is going to do a huge ban wave after the new year.
---
I don't reserve orbs as a tank. Reason being I'm not a prebis+ geared tank and i need gear from there. It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.
---
If however I was geared, fully repped and someone not in my guild asked me tank it, I would want first orb as I'm essentially doing it as a service (without first orb it's v low gold per hour). It's Like 1.5 hours of my time too, it's not like mages charging for water, that's my entire time in the evening after work I can spare to play. That's time that could be spent on alt's\helping guildies or doing something to help a my character. I can earn twice as much gold farming otherways so tbh it's not even worth it then.
---
Tanks expecting first orbs for just being a tank when they need to run it as much as you do (in my case as a druid tank) is not cool. I agree some badly geared tanks are abusing this orb expectation.
---
Dps expecting geared tanks to tank for 1 or 2 hours out of the goodness of their hearts and getting confused when they don't want to run a dungeon they need no gear from is also not cool.
---
The main priority of most players is to gear themselves and their guildies who they are friends with. Whether that's the way it should be or not is up to debate. But I don't see dps offering to boost sm for randoms for free as pure charity very often so it's not just tanks with this mindset.
---
Imagine as a kid how long it took you to beat a game like Super Mario World. Now imagine going back to play it and how you can probably beat it without hardly dying. Or a game like Shining Force 2 where as a kid I could barely get past the big boss that only got damaged by Achilles Sword and now I can go back and probably beat the whole game in a day or two
---
Older stuff is easier to beat
---
Sorry to say but....
---
OF COURSE Shadow Mastery’s 10% damage increase scales with additional spell power. The same goes for any %damage increase. If it didn’t it would be really shit and a bug.
---
And of course SM/Ruin is viable, DS/Ruin is simply better. 
---
I’m happy you tested it but this was all known for a long time
---
&gt; - *Improved Imp for the extra stamina.*
---
&gt;  - Please don’t ever make your warlocks spec Improved Imp. Seriously. SM/Ruin warlocks can use their (untalented) imp for the stamina buff if you truly find it necessary (it should not be), and that is fine. But requiring your warlock to spec into Improved Imp means they either a) cannot get 5/5 shadow mastery, making their dps gimped, or b) cannot sacrifice their succubus, making their dps extremely gimped. The extra bit of stamina is not that important, let your warlocks use a proper raid spec.
---
As a matter of fact, if your guild tries to get you to go Improved Imp for raids then do yourself a favor and **go ahead and find yourself another guild** because any guild that thinks this is needed is likely a dogshit guild that won't make it anywhere close to AQ. 
---
30% more blood pact looks nice on paper but the actual increase is laughable (like only 140 more HP over standard Imp). If tanks who are already hitting over 8,000 HP are dying  in a fight, then Improved Imp will not be saving them and will actually cause more harm than benefit because one of your warlocks is hitting like a wet noodle and doing the same DPS an SM/Ruin lock in greens would be doing.
---
I mean it was only the bis combat trinket in wrath
---
Happened all the time
---
&gt;Faction identity is lost completely.
---
I don't feel any less Alliance just because we have draenei shaman and they have belf blood knights.
---
Resto druid's bonus to rejuv talent doesn't scale with healing for example.
---
before you get upgrades for it, it feels incredibly minor though, like you spam it 3-4 times because it doesn't scale with spellpower between each mob. even towards 60 it starts to fall off again. 
---
it does make a big difference to levelling speed though.
---
Get that rank 10 helm/shoulder combo, my dude, the stats are absurd and the horde version looks incredibly cool.
---
You get past 5 instance cap by going Cath then armory then resting. Everyone with a brain knows this
---
Uh ok?
---
Time locked progression.
---
no.
---
&gt;Blood Elves' racial paladin seal. Retri PvE paladin just doesnt work on ally as far as i know.
---
It's a seal Alliance paladins have, with a different name and visual effect.
---
If you were around when this sub launched it was fairly obvious that the goal was to segregate the r/wowservers population from the r/classicwow sub, altruistically to offer a dedicated community to a Blizzard-operated Classic.
---
I find it interesting that I can repost a worthless meme about getting a purple item and get a thousand upvotes with mod attention, but bringing up valid concerns with the game and saying the word "Nostalrius" will draw the mods' ire.
---
Do they have a way to transfer from a PVP server to a PVE one?
---
Don't know about the rest of it, but you can bug out the Imps either by running out of the arena as you drop the boss below 50% and hopping up on the ledge/railing that goes up the sides, or by jumping from the small rock behind the boss up onto the base of the pillar.
---
Uhhhh no? Defense should be wherever the base needs defending.
---
Literally no reason to not have ban 'waves' every 2 weeks, especially those lvl 50+.  Oh boo hoo they'll figure out what banned them, but its so obvious at this point why not.
---
GL even getting one black lotus on any medium + higher pop server lol. 
---
Herbalism will always be solid though. Everyone buys potions all the time, for all sorts of content. You’re generally just power grinding DM:E lashers tho..would say that’s much faster than riding around in the world competing with bots/other people.
---
Did you play the video?
---
Doesn't work as in partial functionality or not recognized at all?
---
15 minute enrage timer
---
Alliance players*
---
Well one thing we have found is that changing the loot prio can cause issues, since it can mean a player that once had access to an item having that access taken away. So I would recommend only changing if absolutely necessary. Changing DKP cost is usually fine if you're using it. 
---
For the gun, any warriors using the Fight Club sheet will have seen that BSL is useful to them, but so is Striker's Mark and many will still go for that regardless. Rogues generally aren't interested in the gun aside from dagger rogues but it's mostly just for PvP. However all rogues want the bow. So you've got to weigh up giving a bow to a Warrior, who also has the gun they can use, but only if they are hit capped.  If I were on a loot council, I'd generally prefer to see the gun go to warriors, but only if they want it. And having it shouldn't exclude them from getting Striker's Mark later on down the line if their gear changes and they do need the hit. You might be able to convince a few warriors to take guns which frees up more bows for Rogues in the meantime :D
---
This is the sheet I'm referring to:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#

No, I do not.
---
Yours makes WAAYY more sense.
---
&gt;1 fake screenshot happened
---
&gt;screenshots are never ever proof!
---
Yikes.
---
&gt;Lol. 80% horde, 20% alliance wants to have a word with you.
---
As opposed to the wonderful faction balance Classic has.
---
&gt;Those are outliers
---
Those are most definitely not. Hell a server DIED because Alliance were so few they literally migrated.
---
Try giving him some wine.
---
FALSE- i play a warrior and am able to facehit the keyboard and win.   This is wow. It is not a hard game.
---
It reflects on your intentions prior to submitting the post
---
You are being dishonest
---
The answer is 100% no. The experience today is unrecognizable.
---
&gt;Mages were using intellect gear instead of spellpower etc
---
Maybe in MC. But by BWL they figured out spell power was the way to go.
---
If BG queues are such a game breaking issue horde players have two options. Re-roll Alliance or stop playing BGs.
---
Bitching about blizzard not doing anything to prevent faction imbalance 4 months ago accomplishes absolutely nothing.
---
Find a premade server, man. Had forty matches yesterday and lost two.
---
gz, one more to go
---
A good point to make with all of this is to know that the overall WoW community has just simply gotten better at playing it. We were all new then and now we just stomping the competition. 
---
40v1 Comp Stomp!
---
The gear also plays an important role in progress raiding. At first the new raids are difficult and only top guilds can beat them. With the new gear it becomes easier every week and other guilds can progress through the raid.
---
Without the gear treadmill there is no progress raiding.
---
Expansions just provide a clean reset to prevent power creep and it lets new players and re-rollers catch up.
---
AQ40 is the first raid with an actual dps warrior "set" - fury jumps in dps like none other there.
---
&gt; Way to get me censored though with the phony downvotes
---
Wow, you really are a special brand of stupid. You think anyone cares enough about your opinion to build an army of sock puppets to downvote you? If your opinion were actually a reflection of what people thought, you'd be upvoted by far more people than one person with some bots.
---
&gt;this fake reddit
---
What the hell is a "real reddit"?
---
&gt; I'm reporting this subreddit for failure to monitor and for pretending to be a fan reddit instead of a Blizzard reddit 
---
Uhhhhh..........reporting to who for what? Good luck with that!
---
&gt;reporting and your account to the Federal Trade commission of astroturfing
---
HAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA holy shit, do you actually believe there's such a thing?! Check this guy's post history, I knew he was stupid and out of touch but this is a whole new level of pathetic.
---
No the CL just shows that it did damage, I think
---
Nah sounds like he's remembering a friend and sharing a positive story about a game he likes. While you, on the other hand, are making an ass of yourself.
---
top kek
---
Meh fuck PvP gear. Upgrade not worth the time at all.
---
Something you know little to nothing about from what you said.
---
yeah, i mean i skip everything after fenrir cause the door only opens when you kill him, its not worth the gph to kill nandos and arugal after that
---
I played all my life on pvp server, I have never seen anything like that.  
---
But what else can I expect from this sub, no matter what I say, the default response is always "***RolL on PvE SeRvEr YoU sCrUb***"
---
A perfect score!
---
Indeed, i also  missed being able to peak around without pulling half of the zone :)
---
Alliance have been backdooring straight through the Horde base for 15 years.
---
Yea! Safe to drop truestrike shoulders for high str or AP option :)
---
Try GearMenu, I think you'll find it works much better.
---
Leveling in STV at lvl 30? Too early. You’ll get ganked all day.
---
Gehennas EU - Alliance, it is horrible.
---
&gt;I haven't mentioned PvP in any way, you bring this up due to the world PvP argument for flying mounts or? I don't understand what your argument is here, is it that world PvP should be better for honor farming? I'm confused.
---
Sorry mixed up two different things.
---
Anyway, most people are sitting around AV battlemaster, 15 people in Easter Plaguelands, 11 in Winterspring, several thousands in AV. Sure, it'll die down, but not by much.
---
I've been doing deep fire because I wanted some variety in gold farming so doing Mara now, and been keeping it for AV. It's a lot of fun, the ignite and impact procs are a dream. Just be aware that you are to stand at the back and be artillery, you'll die very quickly if someone jumps on you.
---
Ok. Since according to sims the combination DB+FA is only bested by DB+DB (with critstone).
---
Lol yea, not true, just have to itemize  for 9% hit instead of 6% hit!
---
You have a point but if thats the situation youre probably running with people you know and trust. Idc how geared you are in a pug group. I dont know you, i dont know if you actually know what youre doing, all i know is that you have gear but not skill.
---
If i run with guildies that i know are competent then yes I will split the orbs RR, that isnt the case in pugs. 
---
In pugs i always assume youre bad, why? Becuase it is the case a lot of the time. Im not just getting hit by mobs, I am leading the group, telling them what to kill first, where to go, what not to pull, ti be careful with packs, to not grab the fake ass crates that you know theyll break and then we have to kill the little bugs that spawn, I have to put up with the AFK's that are making my run less efficient, the healer that doesnt know how to downrank. The mage that AE's 1 mob at full hp(yes this has happened more than you would think,) the Dps that are each attackking different targets when youve clearly marked each mob and explain that yes, skull is the main target that needs to go down, the noobs who for some reason think its a good idea to go in front of the tank and end up ass pulling something, again making my run less effiecient.
---
All that doesnt happen when you know who youre running with so if im putting up with you then im running that dungeon on my terms and you can decide wether thats ok with you or not. 
---
The alternative is the green geared tank who has probably never been to the dungeon and actually needs the upgrades.
---
That's really unnecessary for 3 SP. That's a negligible difference at best.
---
&gt; and I will donate to any legal battles they have where they can easily prove Blizzard has failed to deliver anything resembling Vanilla WoW
---
There will be no legal battles because it absolutely DOES resemble, almost perfectly, Classic. Further, no matter which version of the game they implement, it can be argued as "not resembling" because it's a constantly changing product the use of which requires accepting a TOS/EULA that clearly states anything can be modified at any time.
---
You know there are important things you could donate money to, right? Feeding a hungry family is more important than suing a video game company for....not doing something you didn't pay for and weren't promised? That you'd never get anything from a settlement for anyway, not that it'd happen? Pathetic.
---
nah it doesn't make sense and people who parrot this have never actually been involved in botting. Do you know what happens after they do a ban wave? In a day or 2 people fix it and resume. There's never once been a moment of "oh shit they got us and we don't know what to do now" that's why botting still exist in retail. It's a convenient well meaning well sounding solution but it doesn't work and its weird people keep parroting this.
---
Your second statement isn't true (about the lifetap).
---
Also, Ds ruin isn't a true +5% damage increase. In multi target fights where you're allowed to use some corruption spots, you can fish for insane nightfall procs while being SM Ruin.
---
During flights like Garr / Majordomo Executus, you can easily do way more dps as a Sm ruin warlock with an average rng. During single target fights like Ragnaros, if you take about 2mins to kill him you can also easily fish for 2 or 3 nightfall procs ; when you take those into account, you don't do 5% less damage, but more like 2 or 3% less on a pure singletarget encounter. 
---
Benefits of being Sm ruin : versatile for pvp / imp out for HP buff to group.
---
gz on acting like 5.
---
Whitekidney fresh when?
---
That's against ToC as well, not a good argument.
---
&gt; And going "waaa i'm getting ganked stop eeeeet" isn't childish?
---
What's childish about addressing a problem (and it is a legitimate problem), and suggesting a solution to it?
---
You're interpreting his post in the worst possible sense, and the only reason I can see why is because his post was *slightly* rude in tone. Are you really that thin-skinned though?
---
Whats the incentive of spending gold on consumables and enchants under such a system? Seems to be extremely unfair to both those investing in their character beyond the bare minimum, aswell as those doing PvP or other activities between raids other than farming tribute on their hunteralts for gold.
---
I don’t think those 2 mindsets belong to the same people, wow players are not a hive mind.
---
&gt;I knew that the development of Titan was canceled in part due to the hype and success of overwatch
---
It was not. Overwatch is built using resources that were made during the development of project Titan. Titan was put on hiatus and then cancelled long before Overwatch was even announced. Blizzard just didn't formally confirm the cancellation until Overwatch was polished to the point of being ready for beta testing.
---
Straight up quotes from [Jeff Kaplan](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-14-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-traces-line-from-project-titan-to-overwatch) and [Mike Morhaime](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-26-ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-on-why-the-studio-bins-50-percent-of-the-projects-it-starts):
---
&gt;But because Titan was an MMO the Jumper started getting tons of progression abilities... you know covering a whole level up system... so the jumper got shotguns, and knockbacks etc... *it was very cluttered and confused*
---
&gt;"We failed to control scope," Morhaime said. "It was very ambitious. It was a brand new universe, and it was going to be the next generation MMO that did all sorts of different things, it had different modes. We were sort of building two games in parallel, and it really struggled to come together."
---
&gt;Blizzard struggled to wrangle Titan's engine into a workable enough state where it could handle all of the game's demands - but this left other staff waiting while the tools they needed were still being put together. And it was then Morhaime and other execs took the decision to take a step back and consider Titan's future.
---
The project was too ambitious for its own good to the point where it may have been too complicated to be fun to play. Blizzard decided it was better to cancel and salvage the project (hence the development of Overwatch) than spending even more resources for a pivot.
---
they are running the dungeons you mentioned because they need shit from those lmao. they dont need much from strat live thats rare.
---
Stop on by whenever and see what we have to offer! /r/dogshit
---
lfg is a custom channel. nothing you can do about it.
---
No one's forcing you to "keep up" with pserver players
---
And to make it worse shes immune to our like main dmg right?
---
Been looking for this info as well so following =D
---
Nah, fuck that shit. Mages are a dime a dozen. Tanks are not.
---
In theory you could but doubtful they would.
---
the real community man right here.
---
&gt; Then again most of you are just shareholders, people who earn a living shilling for Blizzard or illegal forum manipulation
---
You forgot your citations. Major shareholders have WAY more valuable things to do with their time than....post on Reddit in hopes that it impacts the value of one of their stocks by mere pocket change? Hey please direct me to these jobs "earning a living shilling for Blizzard", because as someone who once worked for Blizzard this sounds like a WAY easier job and I never saw those job listings! Unless, of course, you're a conspiracy theory peddling idiot who can't back up anything they say.
---
&gt;Hope people are ready for this companies stock value to tank again
---
Hope you're ready for some facts, it hasn't "tanked" in years and when it "tanked" it was still more valuable than it had been for most of its life. Do you even have a 401k, kid?

"click for feast"
---
lmfao idk what your server you’re on but you’d be ridiculed if you posted these “terms”  in lfg/world on my server. may as well reserve the greens and runecloth at that point.
---
herod already has one for horde and alliance. I think some if not most of the other servers have setup a discord for their servers.
---
A lot of effort went into this, I appreciate it. Kinda hard to follow at first, but if you go back and reread a few things it’s really informative. Keep up the good work!
---
I have fun playing it, and the moment I stop having fun I stop playing the game and do something else. What he's saying is that he's not going to do something for hours and hours and hours every day for weeks and weeks that is not fun, in order to then get a reward so that he can then "start having fun". If the grind is not enjoyable or fun in some way to him, then he won't do it. I.e. he won't be on here complaining about "having to do the pvp grind" to get the gear, because if you're not having fun doing what you're doing, and it's such a big chore that you hate, then why the heck do it?
---
Gross
---
Worse dps than MT LOL
---
we insult eachother a bit then proceed to balinda
---
yeee
---
I am ridiculed but i'm also the one actually able to get a group and run the dungeon so it's not like i care.
---
It's just arcane damage greens that nobody else wants anyway. That guy's from a guild that is fine with having total meme specs, don't see anything wrong with that.
---
Except the math doesn’t account total raid damage so I won’t trust it.
---
Thanks a lot Dive! 
---
You could add the part about DoT snapshotting behaviour in classic since it was confusing for me for a long time.
---
It's always been $15/month with discounts for buying it 3months and 6 months at a time which could lower it to $12/month.  Same offer as you get now.
---
Unless you're outside the US where currency compared to the $ has varied.  The price has never changed in the US.
---
It doesn't matter you wasting a player slot that could progress the PVP BATTLEGROUND. NOT THE PVE RAID
---
Yea its pretty incredible how many quests in classic aren't scripted right. Escort quests are especially bad, a lot of the NPCs just ignore aggro
---
naw feelsgoodman cause all the braindeads in your team just left on their own.
---
&gt; Cus console CPU's were an outdated, slow clocked pre Ryzen AMD CPU that couldn't handle a MMO
---
The Dreamcast and the PS2 handled MMOs. Try again, maybe with some technical citation for your laughably ignorant claim. Good luck with that!
---
Word has it the bots are still soloing the dungeon
---
&gt; Ret pal have 5% parry, +5% crit, +6% damage, +8% movement speed and +15% vengence procs speedup leveling quite fast. 
---
The utility of being able to heal or tank can greatly increase the speed with which you find groups. Holy tree can greatly increase your own survivability. And you still deal approximately the same amount of damage.
---
I've never liked Ret leveling because the bonuses from the entire tree are honestly abysmal.
---
&gt; You can't use Consecration during leveling, it's too much of mana. 
---
Cons opens up the ability to tank regardless of spec. That's the point of it.
---
&gt; Two Judgements deal same amount of damage for the 1\\3 of mana. 
---
You can use 2 judgments in addition to other abilities.
---
To each their own, but personally, I've preferred to lvl all my pallies as holy/prot. It was always faster than pure ret.
---
It's Christmas, 80% of my guild haven't been online for a week. It's already died down, AV launch week I got standing 1400 on my server with 125k honor, the week after I got the same amount of honor roughly and I got standing 300.
---
There's a few hundred per faction that go hardcore PvP grind, the rest quits when they get exalted which is already a lot of people.
---
Its paid, but they do
---
no, classic wow isn't.
---
Not always. I’ve been in games where we see we are against a premade and enough of us head to Drek to defend that we can wipe the zerg. Doesn’t always work but it’s pretty satisfying when it does.
---
It used to be in vanilla. 5-6 hours a day of WSG, even a little less with a premade, was enough for slowly pushing to rank 10.
---
What if you were shadow priest?
---
Old school runescape is better than classic WoW
---
You are the hero Azeroth needs.
---
Well, until the ban wave occurs they are doing absolutely nothing. Then after the ban wave has hit every botter will again roll a mage and hit level 60 within 2½ days played - and we're back waiting for the next wave sometime in the future :)
---
At the end of the day I think bliz sees classic as a way to get people back into retail, or at the very least easy subscriber numbers for people that would never swap to retail. But what I don't understand is why would they think I want to swap to retail when this game gets such shit support? If they won't do anything to fix botters/cheaters in this why the hell would I want to swap to retail and have the same thing happen?
---
What about the tanks that require this to tank for you on strat live “ That’ll be 20-30g , all orbs res’d, greens res’d, whites res’d, non-bis blues/BoE’s res’d, epics res’d, for my service thanks”. I don’t mind a tank that is reserving the 1, 2nd or even all the orbs, but damn... the guy wants the whole instance plus upfront gold and still ends up putting on his argent Dawn trinket to gain rep / loot scourge stones. What a gentleman and a scholar, these tanks do exist and I never ask them to run anything for me.
---
Sure galv is harder than balinda, but you can literally solo pull drek as alliance.
---
I have to get my TUF though bro
---
I think you don't know what he's trying to say, you missed his sarcasm lol.
---
Looks like you should’ve rolled pve server mate
---
No I would say I’ve known it ever since 2008
---
its /roll gambling for people with more gold then they know what to do with.
---
The more gold you put in the higher you get to roll first  to roll a 1 loses the game and every thing they bet.
---
I agree. Also it’s weird to me how everyone on reddit talks as if every MC group out there is doing a sub 2 hour clear while in reality most pugs  don’t go 10/10 and the majority of guilds still wipe on rag.
---
You managed to misuse the word legitimately, so at least yours will come with a learning experience
---
When you were being camped in IF, did it not occur to you too unflag from pvp?
---
maybe there’s an extreme tank shortage on your server. I specifically remember one guy on mine where he tried to res all orbs in a strat live run and was lf2m dps for 30-40 minutes (all of which people were making fun of him in chat) and he ended up giving up. that shit is ridiculous. you better be god’s gift to earth if you’re taking all monetary value from a dungeon
---
night elf priest, now are we talking
---
Good stuff, now I can ask: any private servers running with this updated 64bit client for vanilla, without all the dumb shit changes blizz made to the game?
---
I'd love if we could get 64bit client private servers going!
---
Don't forget the battlestation posts
---
Get the addon AtlasLoot, you can find most items there and can directly link them
---
If there was a dungeon that took over an hour, possibly 2 and required a mage to complete but offered no gear but a couple gold for your time. Would you run it for other people you didn't know for free?
---
Maybe you would. Maybe you'd run it a few times to help the community, but you'd stop eventually or do it rarely during downtime.  Probably just do it for guildies most of the time. Most people just wouldn't do it though and there's be high demand for mages for that dungeon.
---
You'd probably be miffed if a bunch of non-mages were posting about how selfish you were for not doing it for free too.
---
The situation you describe is one in which I completely agree that you deserve all the orbs if you’re running with idiots man. I’m not tryna call you entitled for doing that or downplay the work you’re putting in when you’re tanking for people who don’t know what they’re doing. If you gotta “put up” with them that’s your choice and you deserve all the orbs you get. I was simply trying to show that situations exist when the blanket tank gets first orb no matter what doesn’t apply. 
---
That situation, more often than not, does not apply to pug groups where you create the team with “LFM strat live orbs reserved for geared tank come get your pre bis with no competition!”. Advertising like that will be a magnet for dps who will make you work as hard as possible. 
---
I’m not trying to say that mages are a valuable commodity either. Obviously they are not because the practice of charging a group an orb while spamming lfg for a mage to complete the group is common practice. 
---
But mages who understand how to run the instance and burn trash down without requiring the healer to oom to keep them alive, that make your runs smoother and NOT have all of that headache inducing drama you described above, aren’t gonna ever run with you if you decide the headache and extra time/effort of dealing with that is worth you reserving your first orb / all the orbs for that run. 
---
If you haven’t tried running live with a group of people who are competent I highly recommend it. You will clear the dungeon in half the time (sometimes less than half) and if you all agree to repeat it for an interval of time you’ll have no downtime between runs and get 4-5 runs in the time you’d normally do 2. And you won’t have to tear your hair out telling people to attack the skull first in the process.
---
2k seems quite low to me though, i have had several games of 3.3 to 3.5k honor in 10 mins. 
---
Over 1 hour that would be 20 min queue, 10 min game, 20 min queue, 10 min game = 7.5k honor per hour
---
While with turtle that would be 25 min queue, 30 min game and 10 min in queue is 6.5k per hour in your example.
---
Looks messy and this photo is clearly admiring gear
---
Yeah bro just go get rank 10! Ez!
---
Similarly u could aim for frostbite + BSH.
---
* Ignore Complaints

---
If you saw you'd understand the botting they do. They literally sit there all day and night. Theres upwards of 6 of them at a time not moving at all while theyre online all night.
---
That odd moment when you put words in other people’s mouth and look foolish
---
ElvUI reskins the whole UI and allows you to easily change fonts. If you're not into that, MonkeyQuest comes with a separate quest log.
---
I've always said this. WoW isthe journey. The levelling. Seeing peoplehigher level than you and lower level. Thinking damn that guy looks cool and haha look at that noob. 
---
It's fun clearing dungeons and getting upgrades. And even if you dont get loot you got exp.
---
Life at 60 is boring. Everybody feels entitled. Theres a shortage of tanks because they have all the gear they need from dungeons and are raid logging yet tanks are made fun of for res rules when making groups.
---
Life at 60 is spamming LfG chat or sitting in a que. And raid logging.
---
It feels so pointless to farm gold etc.
---
I got my epic mount and most of my pre bis and bis and even for raiding I'm not so excited for anymore.
---
Might be time to hang up the ole WoW coat for now.
---
I wouldn't take it until after all the mages and warlocks got it
---
Boomkins also want arcane damage, but ye there's barely any competition.
---
You're mistaken in your assumption about people who dislike flying mounts
---
Damn, the amount of damage that thing deals is a 7:4 ratio of what it did to the caster. That death ray would have CHUNKED based on how it melted their hp. And yeah it’s too bad it doesn’t work with bubble haha.
---
I didnt deal with the crashes later on with lights hope, but the community was most definitely more toxic. At least we dont have neckbeards spamming the n word everywhere in classic.
---
Wait a sec, are you trying to trick me? The video clearly says you need to jump backwards.
---
I tried it myself and it worked just fine on the 1.12 client (but I suck at jumping so I used a keyboard bacro): https://streamable.com/grad3

The top DPS on the world first Rag would only spend combo points on eviscerate, overcap on energy, and click abilities.
---
There’s dozens of these posts every week dude. We really don’t need your specific and not unique version of events on pvp servers, especially with BGs being out and it being a fraction as bad as it was a few weeks ago. Stupid post is post. It’s not an insult. It’s a fact.
---
dunno whether that's complimentin or hatin the post
---
I mean, the bot has to execute some kind of action to pick stuff up. In that same action, a log could be written with the timestamp. Then, on a timer or per-x-amount-of-frames basis, check if the log timer &lt; datetime.now.secondofday-9000. If true, use hearthstone, restart routing.
---
It really doesnt sound too complicated.
---
DME lasher runs are easy to get gold if you have 270+ herbalism. I get about 50 ish gold an hour very consistently. I only can play about an hour and I always find myself with 50g after auctions sell.
---
And you'll keep waiting until they're confident they not only get all the botters, but also properly distinguish who is a botter and who isn't.
---
As someone who was banned for 6 months for botting many years ago during WoD, I have a particularly keen sense of how the whole thing typically goes down - I spent a lot of time on forums reading about how the Blizzard anti-bot system works.
---
I have since rescinded my bad behaviour (I used to script on many games, not just WoW) and have reformed. But in the years since then, it appears not much has changed with the botting community, except the bots seem to be a bit smarter; mine would have never be able to defend itself properly in world pvp.
---
I've seen several bots being banned
---
It can be done, but is hard.
---
You can maybe backwards it, I didn't manage to get up that way.
---
But you certainly can't do it mounted up like you can on classic, I tried for 5 minutes to run into the wall and couldn't get up that way.
---
On classic I can do it in 2 seconds
---
Because we're playing Blizzards classic wow, on private servers t his would have been taken care of instantly.
---
They’re often on the AH at a huge mark up but it is an option
---
It's different from person to person, server to server I guess. I've always played on PVP and I've ALWAYS seen this, all the time, then and now.
---
I just got done selling off my whole set minus the chest. Need that valuable bank space and gold doesnt hurt either.
---
8silver when honored for a teleport rune and 18silver for a portal rune I must spend 2g a day in teleport.
---
Sometimes I even teleport to the same city im already in because it faster than running to where the portal takes me!
---
Private servers were better though.
---
&gt; Coming from someone who never played the game prior to its most recent release. I’m addicted as fuck. Rolled alliance before my buddies stopped playing and since have rerolled horde and have 25 days played on my shaman. 
---
Hey Horde reading this, this is why your AV queues are so long. You made all the Alliance quit! Good job with that.
---
Ok man, thanks feeling the need to comment, no matter how unhelpful and actually useless your comment is, it is actually appreciated.
---
Min/maxing a 15 year old game LOL
---
Just be warned, life as an ally priest is hell on a pvp server even with for the most ally favored servers unless you are shadow since virtually any time you step into the world there's a horde rogue camping something that can insta kill you.
---
you have the front gate and the ramp/tower right in front of the frostwolf towers, a VERY solid choke point that alliance has zero way past without fighting through, you guys can just skip the one choke point in the ally base with ease.
---
Back in vanilla I remember LFG channel was removed for this very reason during a patch. I also recall blizz being very strict about language in this channel too as I've had friends reported for swearing in LFG and getting temporary bans for it.
---
Hello bot, my old friend.. I've come to report you mining grubs here again..
---
that document is gr8, exactly what i wud also love for the other classes i play/plan to play: priest, rogue, warrior and mage
---
Your entire post is 10/10 useless and stupid
---
Never said voicing concerns / complaints 4 months ago was the wrong thing to do. But complaining about decisions made 4+ months ago and require a time machine to correct is a waste of time and an excercise in futility. 
---
The game is at a point where there aren't any good or easy solutions to faction imbalance. Even if paid faction transfers were implemented not enough people would make the swap to result in a positive impact. Instead of 35 minute queues you'd have 33 minute queues.
---
You are more than welcome to contine yelling until you are blue in the face. It won't change anything and BG queues are only going to get worse when the PvE players get rank 10 for their handful of BiS pieces.
---
I would argue +4 to chest is never worth it until you have like Tier 3 or whatever. 100x more gold for like 20 more mana? Phooey
---
Who said it was supposed to be enjoyable?
---
Remember to lead your shots in halo 3
---
go for most populated realm. u dont want to play a low pop realm that will die in 1-2 yrs

Battlegrounds are cross server
---
I think you’re wrong about the sunken temple reward:
---
1. It is not comparable to “just” a soul shard as this one slot can generate 2 shards an hour, over a days worth of /played that is at a minimum 48 shards
---
2. It’s the only VW summon one the game that can’t be interrupted (ok fel dom is basically untouchable but can in theory be blanket silenced, this trinket should be able to be used even while silenced)
---
3. You say it’s a wash on all the rewards because they’re all bad, but the other two rewards are literal vendor trash and this trinket is decidedly not that
---
I asked a mage in iron forge the other day. He said he makes 200g in tips a day.
---
What add-on can I use to see what spell enemies are casting? If at all possible?
---
you don't need to convince me.
---
once again i am saying that suspicions are in order as long as proof is not provided. 
---
another thing - i didn't say that you are suspicious because you have an interest in a certain type of mmo, i said that is dubious that most of the moderators have at least 5 subs to manage. also if you pair this with some complains that subs are poorly moderated and mods come in and say : you know, some of us have jobs, families, duties. also the fact that you find same persons modding several subs seems like its a closed casket. do you have to be a Freemason or a Scientologist? is it based on eugenics?
---
&gt; You're also suggesting that three rival MMO companies are paying me simultaneously to manipulate content in a certain way to their purposes.
---
whn proof is lacking suspicions are here to stay. i think it's a logical step. we're not talking because you want to be friends that indulge each other, we're talking to support our principles, our logic, our fundaments.
---
i mean, after all this, i'm gonna ask you to borrow me 50k euros. in order to convince you i will say "Integrity &gt; Cash tyvm." and " integrity is of personal importance.". would u lend me the money? replace 50k with trust. tehre is no proof or sign that i will keep my word except for the fact that i'm telling you that i will keep my word.
---
&gt; I do joke about getting paid for moderation because in all my years of moderating it is hilarious to me that I would ever be paid by anyone for doing it.
---
i think we both agreed that astroturfing exists and is present on reddit so it shouldn't be that hilarious. :)
---
&gt; In reality I suspect if payment was offered for moderation that people like myself would be forced out of moderation roles to protect the interests of whoever is bank-rolling mods.

are you familiar with the concept of [Benevolent dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship)?

Eyeglasses are very useful for black lotus farming as well
---
The nostalgia is worth the bank space to me. For now, anyway.
---
Also on Atiesh alliance I haven't had to many issues with this as I usually just ignore the main trolls who try to get a rise out of people. You can try the Add-on Puggle you can set it up to look for specific dungeons when people say LFM XYZ.
---
Tf..... lol
---
Lol what do you need to move in and out of to curse as DS/ruin? Even Magmadar you can max range.
---
I love when people give perfectly structured and punctuated sentences that are just factually wrong. There should be a sub for this kind of content. Confidently wrong maybe.

Ony attune was a lot smoother than ppl make it out to be.

So you didn't keep your word?

What happens if I drop the Unfired Ancient Blade in front of Onyxia but die before it gets breathed on/ I loot it? Do I get it back? Does it stay in the ground? Do I have to get another one from library?

Gnome rogue because just imagine being a big mean tauren and getting killed by a small gnome

List how to

It doesn't take too long to get leveled up (which is the best part of classic i think) and most guilds have MC/Ony on farm so its not hard to get into raids either.
---
Correct! But I still firmly believe it worked!
---
But if they're private, how could I show others?
---
Second this, would also like to see minor balance implementation between talents and abilities, give druids a normal rez, etc. Just to change the meta up a little bit without bastardizing every class the way retail has
---
So I played a bit back when classic released but started doing other things and stopped playing. Is now a good time to try again I want to play on a PvP server but from what I can find online there is apparently a lot of faction imbalance and alliance is getting annihilated. I was playing a orc shaman on Stallag when I last played but wanted to try playing a human rouge now but don't think Ill have fun if its as imbalanced as people say. Is there any place where I can go to find the most balanced servers?
---
First time playing the game and you aoe leveled instead of questing? Interesting choice...
---
&gt;-cannot become uncrushable like warrior can
---
Paladins can. Druids cannot.
---
Completely agree here. The trinket is 100% unique. We have nothing else like it. Any decent PvP warlock will be swapping trinkets constantly. 
---
I use my Nifty Stopwatch on cooldown and I'd use the voidy trinket on cooldown too.
---
If sappers are still expensive you can add mining for solid stone
---
Technically true but you just failed your job interview
---
Well yea. I guess we have another "one shot" situation at hand.
---
Sounds more like a cute multibox
---
Not really, you gave no good reasons for anything. Your just full of shit.
---
It's not okay to shame people for not being min-maxers. 
---
It's also not okay to shame people for being min-maxers. 
---
But it is okay to shame people for shaming other people.
---
Oh, just play a paladin it gets way worse.
---
As a 60 warrior what's best solo way to make money, currently leveling herbalism but it's slow process. Any good item grinds? I've seen to have success just grinding mobs and selling greys more than anything else
---
Its is! I get bored with games really easily, but I've been going HAM on classic since release and not bored yet. IMO though, I think the leveling/interaction with people out in the world way more interesting than Raiding/BG's
---
Nothing wrong with either. Dwarf is only good in a few specific boss fights and realistically you only need 1 or 2 in a raid of 40, if at all. In PVP it depends on what your are fighting, as Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer are nice, but so are Shadowmeld and Star Shards. The Aurastone Hammer is fine? Maybe they're waiting on an eye to drop.
---
Better on a Paladin than priest
---
So people who love ganking and camping people, like flying mounts?
---
pvp happened in a battleground. send help.
---
Strategies mean nothing when bosses die in less than 45 seconds.
---
PvE is a joke because it’s 15 years old and laughably easy.
---
I remember Muru being quite intense but I dont know modern raiding so it might be easy to current standards.
---
Well, if blizzard wanted to tackle premade alliance queing I wouldn't ptorest it.
---
that way the average AV match wouldn't be complete aids, and make the game more enjoyable overall.
---
I'm using a macro like this in the meantime, 2h weapons so I don't even need the slot number just /equip item.   I was just posting to see if anyone is using an add-on for item swapping that does it in combat
---
ive heard these points
---
agree to disagree
---
Yes sir,  tysir
---
Hks arent related with your rank, you get honor, get as much as you can and if you get more honor than people in your bracket youll climb. It will take a while to get any important rewards if you start this late.
---
I'm wondering: How much does the 6 piece (?) actualy do on average in a boss fight?
---
in silithus some of the spawns are in the elite areas right? How does that affect you.
---
go DME with a pala/shaman preferably but priest works fine too.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIf2wiKTSow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIf2wiKTSow)

Make sure you have mining + enchanting, herbalism is a nice plus.

Awesome write up, I just finished leveling lock to 60. What an awful experience it was.

---
Would love to see Grim Batol (Wetlands) and Uldum (Tanaris) turned into raids.
---
Boting is clearly against TOS. But is AFKing against it? As long as they move or click a spell are they doing anything ban-able?
---
I play 3  months and have lvl 59 still xD
---
The priest +10% healing talent also only applies to the base spell value.  Same with Improved Renew,
---
60 pally here.
---
For me, holy reckoning is the most fun and versatile spec at 60. That's 25/26/0. You can tank dungeons, aoe farm, heal any content, play support in pvp, healing and using reckoning for burst damage, and solo kill mobs quite efficiently if you learn how to sit for reckoning stacks (incoming people who say you can't do that). It's very fun and you feel like you can do anything when combined with engineering. I tried ret reckoning but that is a very selfish gimmick spec as you cannot heal, tank, or dps well. Now I'm 20/0/31 and it's alright. But holy reckoning is baller.
---
However, for leveling you should go full ret until at least level 40. I tried respeccing to prot and hated it. At 45 you can choose to go ret-reckoning for sit crits, or just start putting all points from 41-60 in holy.
---
It is important to realize that different pally specs are only good with decent gear. Full ret feels like trash in pvp if you are in anything less than pre-raid bis with unstoppable force imo (I would know), but is quite deadly when you get some good MC gear and high crit. Reckoning acts as a crutch so you can fight back and cheese classes that are better than you. And holy is good in pvp regardless of gear because of all the utility. So I think holy reckoning is good overall.
---
You have to want to be a paladin, and be willing to sacrificeca bit. It's usually an up-hill battle, especially if you are alone. Make friends that appreciate your support. If you don't want to be a paladin, you will probably hate it after level 50 and reroll eventually.
---
Also, there should be guilds that let you play as whatever spec, class, or race you want. At least on my server there are. Don't worry about that. End rant.
---
Blizzard has a long and distinguished record of not giving a fuck when it comes to AFK botters in AV.
---
thx brother!
---
i was losing sleep, not eating right, wife said i wasnt hard enough and she doesnt understand what's going on!
---
oh well, not anymore! 
---
was thinking of starting r/im14andthisiswow wanna be a moderator there? 1 herb baked egg every tuesday. NO EXCEPTIONS! or my name is not herb.
---
So improved Curse of Agony will only add roughly a flat 63 damage whether you are naked or in full raid gear?
---
No, they weren’t.
---
This is such bullshit....  Blizzard can easily download the fucking bot script, and figure out how it works.
---
Which one? 🤔
---
I made a comment that wasn't even directed at you and you jumped in and wrote a fucking paragraph about it so you're definitely a little upset about it. Maybe you've been ganked too many times? You're acting like you're going to fix ganking. you aren't. your options are to get killed take the L and move on, go do something else, or the last option play on a PVE server where this cannot happen. Nice ninja edit to throw in an insult, very adult of you.
---
I am an officer in a guild that feels like it's going nowhere. Through absorbing some smaller guilds recently, we finally have enough bodies to start working through MC and Ony on our own. However, our GM doesn't seem engaged in the people management/wrangling required to organize a raid team. Our officers have tried to pick up the slack with limited success. It feels like we lack organization and leadership. Personally, I'd love to raid and be part of a successful team but I worry that it isn't in the cards for this group. 
---
My questions for you are: have you ever been in this position? How did you handle it? Should I give it more time to see if we can get things moving in the right direction (my preference) or cut bait?
---
I'm on a small server so there aren't a ton of big guilds around, and the ones that do exist don't seem to be recruiting my class. But I might have options if I poke around.
---
Then why not include them in your post? It’s entirely disingenuous to suggest that slot is just a lackluster soulshard when it produces 2 shards an hour or failing to include that you can summon a VW while locked out of shadow spells or spells entirely
---
Well, I haven’t played AV in classic yet but this wall jump isn’t something that came out in Legion as your title suggests. Do the archers hit them? They should cuz it’s not far at all from the tower but I think I recall alliance archers always having an incredible long range with their shots but that may have been tweaked or nerfed over the years.
---
Seriously. It was 100% there in vanilla but not widely used because it was harder to get up there if you played on a potato. Fucking u/reebers43 is making shit up.
---
No changes was a streamer-led thing, vocal minority. 
---
Also it was never "no changes" just "we don't trust Blizzard to make changes". With good reason, since the only thing they had wiggle room on, which AV version to release, they completely fucked up.
---
ICC heroic had easy mechanics. Bad example to use. All bosses but Putricide and LK were killed within a few hours from the first pull. The reason Putri and Lk took longer was because of artificial difficulty due to limited attempt and God awful tuning
---
TMI
---
Really? I didn't even level with drain tanking but found it to be a pretty easy experience. Between my VW and fear I could manage just about everything solo.
---
I have a 47 rogue.  Currently questing Feralas.  Hinterlands and/or Searing Gorge are on deck.  As far as dungeons- Zul Farrak and Uldamon will get you XP and useable drops, but I am looking forward to Mara to get the thrash blade quest reward for killing Princess.
---
Please accept friend requests.

Ty mate
---
From my understanding, if you ban them slowly then the figured out what their doing to detect them. Ban them all at once and it's a lot harder for them to piece together what got them caught and make a change so they remain under the radar. It's always been their policy. If someone can invent a method that can ban botters as fast as they make new bots, then you got yourself a good job opportunity.
---
Im the complete opposite, if they announced that they were gonna do a hard reset with "seasons" like PoE or diablo then I'm literally quitting tomorrow.
---
Most players were and a great many still are. The average player is pretty fucking awful today, though better than higher end players from Vanilla. It’s both impressive and depressing at the same time.
---
You CAN, but you need to eat a crit to get there, which negates the whole thing.
---
&gt; THERE IS NO PROOF ON EITHER SIDE SO CHANCES WILL ALWAYS BE 50/50.
---
That statement is so blatantly wrong it actually made me stop reading for a second to marvel at the idiocy.
---
As long as it's fun, you're doing it right.
---
I love jumping off that with levitate and floating all the way to wetlands :)  the game is truly beautiful sometimes
---
There are no mobs between the burned-down inn at the entrance into Dustwallow Marsh and Brackenwall Village, you just need to stay near the mountains/hills on the left side. No need to go mountain-climbing. The roads through southern Barrens are also reasonably safe.
---
Didn’t all players have to reroll from level 1 when TBC launched???????  That’s what I remember.  People were up in arms about it.
---
Feelspaladinman
---
I'm going for it. At that point, expenses probably won't be an issue anymore and I'm a sucker for that blue steel.
---
They're not.
---
&gt; Nostalrius did not give us nerfed AV
---
&gt;What? Yes they did,
---
AV in Nostalrius had way stronger NPCs, minelayers etc. Yes, obviously games were still pretty quick. But the AV was mostly the older one. The meta was to destroy 2 bunkers/towers and then kill the end boss.
---
&gt; Which part? The ones where GMs got caught selling level 60s to Chinese gold farmers?
---
The part where they did stuff like introducing AV in its older version. For example.
---
&gt; Nostalrius world was seemless. There was neither phasing nor lag when you crossed zones
---
&gt; You're in some crazy denial if you don't think Nos ever lagged or broke when you crossed zones
---
Of course Nostalrius lagged. But the world in Nostalrius was seamless. You did NOT have this very specific lag when crossing zones that you get in Classic. In Classic (and I think it's very evident) every zone is still sharded. All players are put in the same shard. But the shards exist and as you go from one shard to the next, there's this lag.
---
&gt; Nostalrius fixed bugs and issues at a much faster pace than Blizzard devs
---
&gt; Just not the duping, or safe spotting, or hacking because there was literally no anti-chat, or any of the old paladin bugs like SOTC...
---
At least they did something lol.
---
Blizzard does literally nothing when it comes to botting. Blizzard does literally nothing when it comes to phishing. Any reasonably experienced player can tell IMMEDIATELY whether someone is a bot or not. This "banning in waves" shit is a joke. Botters get out ten times what they invest when they bot. And Blizzard does nothing for 13€/month.
---
I was gonna say this, but decided not to.
---
So if they did it without the bot they couldn't get banned?
---
Wow congrat! I *just* hit 60 on my dwarf warrior (15 days logged or something like that). This was my first WoW experience ever - so I’m going easy on myself for reaching 60 a few full days later than some of my guildies. 
---
Just interested, what classes were your two characters! Cheers and happy new year man! I’m loving the game too
---
I was going to not say it, but then decided to.
---
diddly squat
---
Oh
---
I freaked the fuck out!
---
If you thought the item was worth the market value you would have bought it already. But now you want to deny your group the chance for the gold because you dont want to pay the items worth?
---
Who is really greedy here? ;)
---
&gt;This gen consoles CPU's were trash
---
Your ignorance shines through! This gen's consoles ALSO handle MMOs just fine, far better than the console MMOs that existed at the time of WoW's development and release as well as what would have been Titan.
---
&gt;Try playing modern WoW on an AMD FX CPU clocked at 1.6 ghz
---
And that has anything to do with what?
---
I mean is coordinating rank 14s across the server, pretty much making it a play by our rules or get blacklisted a disservice to those who farm honor? At the end of the day, blizz doesn't care about the essential match fixing of rank 14s, so they don't care that someone didn't get theirs when they "should have"cause another botted. Yes they ban the bot eventually, but should they ban the people fixing rank 14s too?
---
Imp. CoA doesnt scale with your spellpowe, so it's a very small dps increase for your skillpoints.
---
I can easily ban av afkers faster than they can lvl a new 60.  Give me GM powers and pay me 30+ an hour and I'll do it.
---
I get good rates for squid in Bay of Storms Azshara. I don’t have any stats on when is best or exact drop rates but I do well in BoS for a couple hours.
---
You can do the same with Vann lmao
---
Servers are restarting right now, I assume a hotfix is incoming
---
works fine for me, there is a trick to getting them to work, buuuuut id rather not have more honor competition so im not gonna tell you how to do it :P
---
Talk about proving the other guy's point with this reply.
---
If u plan to play classic longterm as a raider u could start farming stuff right now. We only have 1 raid available by now (i dont count ony as it takes less than 10 minutes).
---
Imagine BWL,ZG,AQ20+40,Naxx being there.
---
Then you dont only do these raids with your main,you do some of them even with your alt.
---
It will be way more relaxing if you manage to build up gold and stock up on consumables now...
---
Who said about white crit vs yellow crit. Blastershot is a pvp weapon.
---
yes and your demonstration seems to be as vast as your ...yeah fuck it 
---
you're and idiot buddy so fuck off on the ignore stash
---
How so? It only removed random ganking from the game
---
I decided to pick up Alchemy to make my own consumes for raiding, anyone have any tips for making money with alchemy outside of the basic sell your Xmutes. I mean obviously make potions but are there specific ones that sell always and forever/are there good ones I can farm up now and sit on?
---
You set your own goals in this game.
---
Not everyone is raiding end game, not everyone is aiming for rank 14. Not even everyone has a lvl 60 char.
---
If you aim end game content you will be behind, but you still can catch up.
---
Will you have fun? If that is your goal, you most certainly will.
---
Every 2 or 3min u get to 1 shot someone.  Sounds worth it to me.
---
https://streamable.com/3h9p4
---
are you happy now? If you still don't believe you can test yourself.
---
True. Cuz of weaponskill and glancing blows.
---
No, paladins can get crushing blow immunity. You dont need a crit to get there. Look up holy shield.
---
My guild has grown and our 2nd raid team started and cleared MC/Ony last week.
---
If they do it seasonally like Diablo it won’t impact the standard playerbase.
---
I'll second the trinket/naglering/thorns combo. Absolutely love watching their health plummet as they're smacking away at me.
---
Mainly drops in raids. It's pretty damned rare. Expect to pay hundreds of gold.
---
Good write-up OP, but you are wrong about spirit.
---
Until spell power comes about, Spirit is your second best stat.  Stamina &gt; Spirit &gt; everything else.  Spirit is the reason I was one of the first locks to hit 60 on my server, significantly bypassing other locks.  Sure in some situations it's not very good, but generally speaking it's an amazing stat because it takes advantage of down time too.
---
Your hit explanation is a little weak too.  There is more to it than spell power.  1% crit is better than 1% hit as well.  This is because of improved shadowbolt.  1% crit isn't a 100% increase in damage.  It's actually 100% + 20%\*4 damage increase.  (So 180%).  Very simplistic and incomplete math here, but let's say your short 1% hit, you deal 99% of your potential damage.  But if you replace that 1% hit with 1% crit, you're actually doing over 100% of your potential damage.
---
I mean you will replace it in bwl with the literal exact same thing except with a set bonus and mages will continue to use it through.
---
r e r o l l a l l y
---
I was going to say that if the GM isn't up to that then they should probably step down to something trustworthy who is willing to, or promote a 'raid-coordinator' to it for them. 
---
If they're not willing to it says pretty clearly that they don't really value progression or the intentions of their guildmembers and probably just enjoys being the big chief more than being a real leader
---
i know man, that's why they call me Slayer of Stupid, Incompetent, and Disappointing Minions
---
Try talking to him first. But if that doesnt work I would bail. You are not ruining your reputation because you have a valid reason to leave and removing bad officers is hard.
---
Yeah but if they don't pay me that why would I leave the job I have that is?
---
And av afkers are not botters.... they literally just use a keyboard macro, auto clicker, or some other easily accessible software to repeat the same actions.
---
You sound like you don't really understand the difference between them and farming/leveling bots...
---
No
---
Omg there IS a secret society. 
---
What reason could there be in the PvE scene to keep information secret from other players?
---
If you can play early in the morning the usual spots might be free even on a big server. Elemental fire in Arathi/various essences.
---
Not enough to justify 25 days played XD
---
Maybe if you aren't queueing with premades
---
I managed to find the 1 of maybe 3 ppl on my faction side server. My friend laughed at me tho. He said it’s a waste of money. And I’ve been checking out other casters’ chest pieces and a lot of them go with the cheaper +3 enchant. +4 does make me happy but he’s not wrong about maybe it being a waste of money. Oh well.
---
Only seen 2 getting sold on my server, one went for 1.6k on AH.
---
I think I have lost all my AV matches the last 2 days as alliance. Not sure if you can answer this question but, why??
---
&gt; As a pally. I don’t mind.
---
Why?   The staff is 50% drop rate, and it's far far superior.
---
You can always make those mandatory to join. How is that any different from regular DKP? What incentive you have to spend gold there? What's the difference?  
---
Why do YOU choose to invest beyond bare minimum in anything you do? Is it to get invited again as a valuable raid member? To show off you're good to flex on others? To make every pull easier for everyone? To increase  
---
your chances of beating the boss? To not get kicked because the bare minimum is actually set at a really high level in your guild? To feel more powerful and enjoy the fights more with all the bigger numbers? Or just because you enjoy the grind?  
---
Or is it really something like "if I'm the best of the best I will get more loot from the loot council"? There's a ton of reasons why people do anything in the game and it varies from person to person.
---
And how are you punished by doing PvP and other stuff? Remember that raiding with GDKP is a steady source of income for you. That way you have money to spend on whatever you want, including resources for PvP, BWE gear or let's say an epic mount. People that hate gold grinding can now just grind gold by raiding instead. Isn't that a fun alternative? Remember that if there is a lot of gold hoarders in your raid, yes, you will have to wait for your turn to get loot until they're equipped, but in the process you will get a shit ton of gold because the prices will get pretty damn high that way.  
---
Again, it has already been mentioned, this system has flaws too. It isn't perfect, there is no such thing as a perfect system. But I think a lot of people look at it from a wrong point of view and ignore some of the benefits.
---
Gnomish protection belt macro to death ray is so OP, negates the damage to caster
---
Dive my dude! Thanks! Great write up #WARLOCKGANG
---
Blizz doesn't care about the individual botting. They care about the people infringing on their IP, which creating a bot is. The dude who bots may get banned for 6 months, but they want the dude who made it fined or in jail. They gotta throw  around their millions of dollars of lawyers weight or bots would be worse. The real threat of consequences for the creators will deter more bots than anything else. Example would be people making scripts for Lol in S Korea faced fines and jail time when caught. Since they cracked down hard on the creators, league doesn't have a terrible problem with scripts(at least in NA), but obviously theyre more complex to pull off than afk bots.
---
They did both in Cata and didn’t have any concrete plans for either back in Vanilla. 
---
With all due respect, what do you expect them to do with those areas, in that case? 
---
Would they reuse the Grim Batol map from Cata and just repopulate it? That would be kinda boring. It’s basically a hall with two side paths. 
---
Lore wise that wouldn’t make sense as we clear it in Cata. Before we clear it, it had been infested by a dragon faction for *quite* some time (since an early novel iirc.) So making it fit lore wise would be tricky. 
---
Would they reuse the zone map for Uldum from Cata as well? Not sure if you played it, but it really wouldn’t fit in Vanilla and is 100% made for flying mounts. 
---
I understand the desire to see that stuff, but as it’s been done I always wonder what people really think *could* be done with that content. Since Blizz is way less into the concept of Classic+ being a “reset” than the folks clamoring for redone content, seem to be.
---
were probably too many people queued on the realm, an artificial limit probably wasn't designed for these megaservers
---
I wish they would rebuild loch Moran in retail.  I miss it.
---
&gt; I don't mind at all, being corrected is how we learn.
---
Exactly, it's good you came back and learned of your mistake. We need that. most people just say something incorrect and never actually realize they were wrong. Well done

Even has the fake traps stance in both; lets everyone know you're not to be messed with.
---
Not defending anybody, but I watched both videos and it looks like that's exactly what he's doing
---
Nice!
---
That is an outdoor dungeon you need a real group and 2 hours of time. Also get your ZF mallet part 1 done firstand finish it there. And theres a tanaris quest that goes yp there
---
Yes, yes and more yes.
---
lol he deleted his comments
---
No, those were never there in vanilla (was added with darkmoon isle)
---
Yeah there's one narrow path for alliance to even get to the horde base. Meanwhile a single horde can just walk into the ally base and cap gy with no resistance.
---
There is none. No world pvp anywhere except maybe searing gorge due to close proximity
---
In Hinterlands, any allies I saw just ran away
---
Telling him to play faerlina is probably the worst advice you could give
---
I linked math and sims that counter all of the points you just made.
---
Where is this pic taken from? Did you take it? Like I said, haven’t played AV in classic yet but in every other version of the game the archers always hit you and the only blind spot was once you successfully completed the jump and hugged the tower.
---
I double checked and even used addons to scan my inventory.  Only 2 were crafted.
---
it's TBC. Some of the streamers have let it slip that they have knowledge of TBC classic in development.
---
Yeah, I took it like 10 min ago.
---
and there is no jump, this is the path I am bitching about https://streamable.com/uzdsx
---
Can confirm i roll for looks and not stats, sexiest gnome in azeroth
---
Well thanks for the information! I was guarding the East tower and saw the west NPCs disappear and thought I was going nuts.
---
Honor system is honor system. They are not popping every consume to prove they can kill you. They are doing it to get 4 extra honor kills before their queue pops.
---
All zones near org, alterac and undercity will contain honor grinders looking to get a few extra kills between queues.
---
Go to ungoro, silithis and those far zones to get more relief.
---
Or literally just roll a over server. You say you've played a PvP server before. Why are you shocked history is repeating itself.
---
Bots are not getting people to quit WoW or at least it is definitely not the only factor when people quit. Bots also make blizzard a lot of money, so isn't it obvious that they will never fully get rid of bots?

Some things can be subjective, but a few are not.
---
Spell batching makes the game objectively worse, for example. Feign death, vanish, and other abilities constantly fail because of it. In the case of fd, my trap fails afterwards a lot in group play. If I stand up too early, i keep aggro. It is so bad that I have just gotten accustomed to pausing for a second any time I use it. Never mind interrupts not working when they should, because of batching. Or not being able to spell juke as effectively. This was done much, much better on private servers that did not have those issues while still having ops mechanics from batching (gouging a blink, for example).
---
What exactly do you mean by "that"? I'm frankly confused at this point what you're arguing against.
---
Well those expansions are still kinda recent. I guess TBC and wotlk are the ones people are nostalgic about so I kinda always assumed those are the ones they will re release.
---
I see myself playing TBC but not wotlk. Wotlk was truly the beginning of wows decline for me in many ways even if it really started in TBC with flying mounts.

uncrushable is based on defense skill, not avoidance. paladins and warriors get the same +def from talents and paladins are perfectly capable of gearing themselves above the soft defense cap, making them uncrushable
---
you're thinking of crits probably, but crits once you're above defense cap aren't really a big deal
---
&gt;-much less defenses
---
see above
---
&gt;-garbage ST threat
---
depends. greater blessings on a stacked class do an absolute meme amount of threat - 60 threat per target affected * 1.9 with talented righteous fury. 6+ mages/rogues/warriors in a raid and you're in business
---
&gt;-much lower base health
---
???
---
&gt;-very little plate gear with spell damage on it
---
you don't really need that much tbh. azuresong with +30sp, sp rings, and t2 basically cover your needs, the rest of your gear can pretty much just be regular tank plate
---
AV chat is the funniest shit. Just say one thing like 'all def' and sit back and enjoy the show.
---
So, you turned in to big fire hammer? That's nice!
---
Mechanically M'uru isn't too bad... but it is indeed a tight DPS check.
---
a lot of guild gave up on him cause they didn't want to replace all their mages with warlocks and force everyone to go leatherworking for drums...
---
However, if (when) we have TBC 2.0... I suspect most PvE'er will be aware of that fact and swap to LW somewhere in black temple
---
tauren warr with QS &amp; skullflame (got draconian for raids). someone in AV told me I have meme gear :(
---
Made the game unplayable. No where safe? Even in the middle of IF? For weeks on end, it was complete bullshit
---
Hi I just hit 49 on an undead warlock. I Just specced into DS/ruin thinking 
---
A) it would be fun to change it up
---
B)get to know my raid spec before 60
---
Is this gonna make the last 11 levels a rough time? I’m already noticing it’s less efficient then the affiction spec I was leveling since day 1.
---
&gt; Go play retail if you want content shoved down your throat
---
sounds pretty accurate to your words.
---
Bet he looked like shit compated to you tho ;)
---
Alliance players : oh noes 5 horde are using the backdoor
---
Also alliance: let’s not put 3 ranged dps in defence to kill them
---
That seems to be pretty common amongst people who suggest things like this.
---
As someone that played Cata, which was arguably Blizzards attempt at Classic + back in 2010, I’ll pass on any further attempts by them to “recreate” the feeling of vanilla.
---
What’s the right answer? Isn’t Crit cap 100-40 (glancing) - 24 (dw hit)?
---
Yeah, that path has been there since the beginning of AV. I know cuz I’ve played since Feb 05 as alliance but if in retail I’m now horde. That wall jump isn’t something that came out in legion. Also, alliance archers and base design is far superior to the Hordes. Also, also, there is a similar wall jump in the hordes base but allies don’t use it cuz they don’t need to cuz Hordes base is super easy to take over, unlike the allies bridge of turtle. 
---
So move on, you have no argument here.
---
....
---
ok. you're a special case.
---
after 6 at max level people are either farming rag, or buying drops in MC for their alt... heck, even on my little earthfury server leaves/eye of divinity are given to alt.
---
if i wasnt in a nice guild rn, i would reroll to faerlina
---
The number of times I’ve mistaken holy Paladins for Priests...
---
Been a bug since classic launch. People were losing stuff like devilsaur leggings too. Just mats gone, No product. I thought it had been fixed, havent seen this complaint in a while.
---
I tested it on a 1.12.1 client tho, and it does not work.
---
The other backdoor jump was always known, but this one I have never seen until the legion client.
---
Yeah why would they pay you in the first place when you clearly know even less than me lol? If you want it the wild west where Blizz shoots anyone on sight for just being afk in av, then by all means let's do it. If you're a programmer, go apply for a job and figure out how to stop them. Otherwise, it's up to the devs on how they want their employees (aka the GMs) to handle av afkers. Seriously though, If you care that much go  develop something that can detect these auto clickers and use it as part of your cover letter when you apply. I guarantee you would at least get an interview if you pulled it off.
---
Been saying this from the beginning.   Even if it made fiscal sense to do classic+, which it doesn't, but even if it did, why would you want them to make it?   The odds they make something even remotely as good as TBC is 0%.
---
Lol yea. Wanna help?
---
Real life is the real monster
---
Yup
---
We use team speak now to all hang out while we use premade discord
---
2 of my tickets were regarding scammers. If that's low prio... well that's bad. I haven't tried web tickets.
---
ok killerduki
---
There's no way to exclude one person from 40 man log.  
---
Of course, technically it's possible for creators of WoWLogs to add this functionality. But you need to ask them about this)
---
I have no idea what you’re trying to argue about here... simple statement: premades were not the majority of games I played in vanilla. No idea what you’re trying to take from that but have fun with it I guess.
---
You may have done almost no damage, but you can rest assured that you at least brought a smile to the faces of four mages.
---
I remember GMs contacting you almost instantly.
---
In theory yes but I don’t think fights are really long enough to get an extra swing in. 
---
But then again those Librams are like 50s vs 80g for 8 strength.
---
Massive W
---
At the same time, vanilla's major mistake was announcing TBC too early and killing the hype/desire for most guilds to even attempt Naxx. We're not even at BWL yet, there's absolutely no rush in announcing what their plans are post-classic because it'll kill most of the motivation for people to do anything, just like it did in vanilla with tbc's announcement
---
No you’re confused. Re-read my topic paragraph. Everyone rolled need. I rolled last. When he lost he went agro 12 year old. It didn’t matter. There was no precedent. His digression didn’t come from me saying I was going to use it, and then not using it. His attitude came from losing the roll period. There was no prior agreement. We all rolled need. When he lost he attempted to coerce the group into giving him the recipe by forcing me to use it. Which again, we all rolled need for the money and I won, so what does it matter what I do with the recipe? I won. I rolled last, and I won. No precedent. Nada.
---
Hahaha. Well done.
---
If you're an alliance player you should go shaman, as that's the horde-only class you'll not do. It's amazing with some good quests.
---
I wouldnt. Every aspect of the game has all the fun sucked out of it.
---
Summoning to world bosses should be assigned to non-warlock mains who level up a 20 warlock imo :P
---
We have to summon them all the time, they can pick up the slack once in a while!
---
Cool take, only the third time this has been posted today!
---
Nope, it is true. Look at the spreadsheet.
---
Nah that BS, that back door jump has been around since the beginning and that’s all there is to it. You can keep arguing about it on Reddit but that ain’t changing history nor will it change the future. 
---
Time to move on.
---
Operating a private server is not illegal? Do you have a source for that?
---
Yep gimme some crit buff mister oomking &lt;3
---
That's unfortunate.
---
Having never played those, I would still like Classic+ to stay on the current continents but add the zones that don't exist, raise level cap to 70, TBC talents, but don't do flying mounts or Outland.
---
This should help

---
So the lvl 40 guy is not falling behing the guy who whos clearled mc 100 times?
---
Bullshit yes you dont need to compete with everyone but that doesnt mean you dknt gall behind.
---
Classic wow is the game you can fall behind the most take a month break and your prettt behind.
---
you can go SM at 20
---
Deathbringer is not good at all for humans, which are the main ally race for pve warriors.
---
If you can find proof on it existing, sure.
---
I think I have pretty strong case
---
Get naked and dance on a mailbox.
---
Just Google it lol. It's not secret.
---
I wish we had Classic WoW, but with updated graphics, QoL improvements and more content.
---
He's following the rules
---
Wow you were correct!  Relogged and it appeared.
---
Thanks!
---
Blizzard has nothing to do with CoD
---
eh. i’ve picked my fair share on Blaumeux
---
I genuinely had no idea about class discord’s until you guys told me. Have had some good reads today. Thanks guys!
---
How much is classic costing you per hour played?  It’s a pretty good fucking deal imo
---
My statement was in response to the iPhone/Android argument.
---
Personally I remember av queues being really long so you could play 2 or 3 ab games in the time a av q would take so av wasint a good way to honor grind alone.
---
It gives you a menu for whatever gear slots you want to swap. Disable any slots you don't want shown. Items can be queued up to swap once you drop combat  as well.
---
Well, my proof is my experience and game time. I’ve been playing since before the release of AV. I played alliance at that time and remember well the horde would use a couple of backdoor strats cuz the bridge was OP. This was when AV would literally last for days and days, before the nerf. Now as horde in retail, I’ve been using that backdoor anytime I play AV and I’m usually the only one doing it. 
---
This backdoor wasn’t created In Legion, you’re dead wrong. I’m done going in circles with you about it. Move on cuz it’s as old as AV itself and clearly ain’t going anywhere.
---
It can be used to generate a full soul shard. You summon the VW then run out of range, giving you a soul shard when it despawns.
---
Most talents work this way. Druid's improved rejuv only increases the base amount. Paladin's healing light only increases the base amount. etc. etc.
---
I don't think there are very many, if any, "+x% to (spell)" talents that affect the total amount instead of just the base amount.
---
Sounds basically like itemrack, I'll give it a try ty
---
How are you gonna fine or jail some chinese bot devs?  Unlikely.  At best you get IP ranges banned.
---
As a software dev, there's tons they could do to combat botting, but the fact they are running rampant says they simply don't care.
---
&gt;bots would be worse
---
They are already bad. If bliz banned those that were obvious [time/day played, responses to automated whispers, analyzing combat patterns for bot-like consistency], there would be less.  If they banned bots before they reached 50 or 60 as a rule, it would not be profitable to run bots at 15/mo, and so it would not be even close to what it is now.  Bots are bad because they know bliz sucks at / doesnt care to deal with them.
---
You always get more xp from a full group. If not full bring some randoms and it will help alot
---
&gt; also reported the cheaters ofcourse
---
Won't do shit, because hurr durr banwaves.
---
Had a mage boosting me in SFK. there’s only a few mobs in the courtyard outside the door that have anti magic shield I believe(I could be wrong) and then the human ghosts that can silence. 
---
The best part of SFK Is that you can leave alts at the portal and they’ll still get full xp as the dungeon has a small footprint. 
---
We did;
---
Rfc 8-18
---
SFK 18-22
---
SM 22-44
---
ZF 44-52
---
BRD 52-56 (can now do gorshak spam to 60)
---
LBRS 56-60
---
I'm starting to get burnt out on my low pop mostly soloing horde character but I still have a lot of fun when I group. Maybe ill take a little break then roll on a high pop ally server.
---
voracity is better
---
Pvp grinding for rank is a full time job if serious.
---
I would have to be the one to get your ticket at the time to pass judgment on if your scammer tickets were misplaced. Maybe it got put in the wrong queue to where it should have been. There are tons of factors at play I can't really speculate on. My only advice is if it's something that can wait till next week, open a ticket. If you need assistance that day like you were hacked and have no gear, open the web ticket. You can even open them for small things and they may frown upon it, but they will still help you. Just work with them and they work with you. Honestly I would give anyone who was nice on webchats game time or battle pets.
---
I did the same sort of test on a boomkin (yea it's fun for an alt) and the 10% dmg (moonfury) did not apply after spellpower, which sucks.
---
If you’re on myzreal, my holy pally would love to join and heal
---
Its 50/50 between all 40 people rushing for towers and commanders and having an actual game where we wipe alliance at Galv and get some recalls.
---
Most horde games are an expected loss where we just mop up the honor. Sometimes somone will type fuck it wipe them at galv and thats we win.
---
I didnt play  vanilla. but from what I have heard that this version of AV was intruduced in late vanilla, so till late vanilla it wasnt effective way to farm honor.  I could be wrong thou
---
Shouldn't be any excuse for not having NR gear since everyone knows ahead of time it will be needed.
