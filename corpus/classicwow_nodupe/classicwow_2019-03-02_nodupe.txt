As a rogue if I engage first from stealth I like my chances. If a warrior engages me first I’m toast.  It’s all me picking and choosing when I want to fight it out.

---
A non-combat progression character could only be done on a role-playing server. But you'd need to rely on combat driven role-players to level you up.
---
Reminds me of Hyjal in Vanilla. Too bad there were no mobs or anything in Hyjal.
---
Wow, no love for the nature resistance?
---
I'd trust a dwarf pally healer over human anyday.
---
You can’t trade an item that you have already equipped, even in current retail, with the way loot trading is implemented. 
---

---
The minute you try you get a pop up that tells you equipping the piece (or selling it, or enchanting it, or or or) will make it untradeable.  
---
I don't think they will have an extensive beta, potentially 2 weeks to a month tops with the ability to create characters at a few different lvl intervals. The release isn't far off and content wise I don't think a lot of testing is necessary.
---
Because people can, did, and will just use addons to work around it otherwise. There's good tedious and there's bad tedious.
---
It’s a buff to professions how do people not see this??? /s
---
Dang, wish the actual health regen was workin for the demo, just to get that full experience... oh well, soon!
---
Yes, &lt;APES&gt; I presume. Mytos (how do you spell his name?), their guild leader, takes PvP too a completely different level. I actually regard them as the best guild the game has ever seen due to their diversity of domination. I'm basing this on stories from friends who play in APES, but I think at the end of the day, their focus is PvP. And PvE is an ingredient in that for gear and resources. It benefits them greatly in their overall operations to be able to clear MC, BWL, AQ, Ony, AQ20, and ZG splits all done in under 4 hours. I don't know for sure, however, if they want to put speed run times down for the sake of speed run leaderboards. That is my primary focus going into classic. So min maxing every pixel for all 40 people inside a raid is what matters too me.
---
I imagine that a lot of human pallys are probably the people who go on /pol/ and say shit like "deus vult" unironically.
---
Was fun to do some PvP against my friends who played on a private server. I got a bit low on health so I bandaged behind a pillar. They got confused as to what the hell I was doing and just killed me right there and then.
---
The servers didn't have line of sight mechanics, just range.
---
Year has not been decided on though!
---
It's slower to implement via add-on and mail limit is reached way sooner.
---
This counts. They've now fulfilled their obligation for more information soon (not soon™).
---
I don't think you need either tbh, with servers the correct size there would really only be overcrowding in the very first zone, so after a couple of hours it's no problem at all, and if you are impatient you can always skip the quests that are the most affected
---
You can totally complete the cactus apple quest in Valley of Trials.
---
Wake up the lazy peons...
---
Pick up a bucket at the well in Camp Narache.
---
Collect acorns in Mulgore.
---
Gather the Tirisfal Pumpkins from the Solliden farmstead.
---
Deliver the burden from Valley of Trials to Razor Hill.
---
Take the rogue's letter from Death Knell to Brill.
---
Delivery to Silverpine Forest.
---
Inspect the boat wreckage across the road from Sepulcher.
---
After that, I'm completely out of ideas.
---
It is if you just spend ten less dollars out of the first five of those six.
---
The amount of people who will play classic wow for “speed running” will be less than a hundredth of a percent.
---
Try to install software from 2005 on your windows 10 machine and let me know how it goes. Its that x1000 without even getting into security and authentication.
---
&gt; That's en extremely pessimistic view of the community. 
---
No, that's realistic.
---
Having very cool community aspects won't prevent some people from abusing loot trading. And the simple fact you can doubt that someone potentially will abuse it in your PuG is already a disaster.
---
No loot trading and no GM tickets is the simplest solution. Why denying it?
---
Hyjal was cool. Wall hacking in their to see the "under construction" sign was pretty cool. I am talking about ungoro being a fully realized zone though. Just one they make on the DL and don't mention is in the game or put on any map. I think it would be amazing if all the "dino" zones were like that.
---
I'm one of the worlds worst PvE healers. It bores me to tears and I don't pay enough attention too it. PvP healing, on the other hand, is beyond awesome.  You get to hide, drop massive heals at the last second to save someone, tank everyone trying to kill you, kite, it's a shitload of fun.
---
&gt;If you ever get in a 1v1 situation in the world, there's not much you can do but run.
---
Depends on the class.  If it's a mana base class generally you can just out heal their damage until they go oom, at which point you can slowly kill them or they just run away.  If it's a rogue or warrior, kite, dot, and keep yourself topped off until they die or run away.
---
You mean like reading Wowhead comments on a podcast?
---
I'm annoyed that the netcode issue got swept under a rug, as in mages could polymorph each other if it occurred in the same tick. Nowadays one player always "wins" and that stalemate doesn't happen.
---
It's a significant difference in terms of tech so I understand why they keep the modern netcode but at least be honest about it and don't exclude it from "will not be fixed" list. That's just avoiding a backlash.
---
We're looking at now, now.
---
&gt; Eh, I feel like this isn't that major of an issue. It literally only affects PUGs pre-60
---
What? lol. It will especially be abused in PuGs post level 60.
---
Don't tell people what to do you absolute melt. 
---
come on man, you really think blizzard would ever even consider having low cap and high cap realms? there's no way they would bother.
---
If they implement intentional lag I will be shocked.
---
If you're gonna go ret, you gotta be human for the +5 weapon skill. It makes a significant difference in your PvE DPS. I think that probably is why rets tend to be humans and not dwarves
---
Ummm what did you call me? (Seriously asking lol)
---
Why would you always carry around a fire resist set AND nature resist set? If you include those than so can a hunter..same with a PvP set and consumables. Not to mention one less bag for hunters(if they choose to) to carry just ammo/arrows. Most raiding DPS warriors won't get a raiding tanking set until the tanks get those sets first, so most of them won't carry a tanking set, but what do I know -- I only tanked MC/BWL/AQ in vanilla. I haven't done any of the private servers, so maybe the times have changed. 
---
That's exactly the point. If only you and 1 other guy need it it should be 1/2 chances of getting it. Not 1/5. It's a huge difference, even more since the item won't loot every run. Why denying that loot trading is bad with such arguments? It has really nothing positive to bring in comparison.
---
I'd prefer having more mana instead of shield specialization and I would rather used the 5 improved healing wave talents elsewhere.

Sometimes just getting to the dungeon was as much as a adventure and challenge as actually completing it! I remember doing the run to SFK and dodging horde ganks half the way there. I think it took my group about 45 minutes just to get everyone to the entrance because we kept getting killed. On top of that, you actually had time to chat with people. When it took 45 minutes to get to the dungeon and another hour to finish it, you usually were able to have some good conversations will people along the way. If they were decent at the game and enjoyable to be around, you'd add them to your friends list and hit them up the next time you were looking for a dungeon group.
---
Uh, absolutely? Have I not been arguing that the entire time? That I want the PvP system to reward reflexes and skill, not hardware technicalities and refresh-rate based luck?
---
Rogues and Warriors don't use it to farm gold, warlocks do.

---
Called you an idiot lmao
---
He comes off incredibly disingenuous. I was watching some of his in-depth class guides featuring people who are actually good at the game (or played at all, unlike him) and he sounds so incredibly clueless, adding no smart/clever/knowledgeable commentary because he has none. It’s very obvious he’s in this for the money. Sad!
---
It says melt. Typo?
---
They cost money, take up bag slots and are just an annoyance.
---
Arrows and literally everything about the pet are the reasons I will never play hunter
---
Honestly bro 3 years ago I woulda said the same thing about classic wow. Now though? I dunno. To be honest I am not a programmer so I do not know the complications of hosting 2 different server sizes. From my perspective it could be as simple as moving a slider. Or be as complicated as being forced to program a new game. I have no idea.
---
It is not lag. It is the system that resolves the difference in latency between two clients. You are okay with them replicating everything else about Vanilla into Classic, so why are you averse to replicating this factor of game play?
---
Boom
---
No melt means idiot
---
So only one person's sub fee, plus taxes, plus employer coverage of any benefits per hour per GM? Meaning that they are paying out 24 player's monthly fee per day, per GM. Actually, with the other stuff maybe 30-35 per day per GM. 720 (Assuming the lower 24 per day) players sub fee per GM for an average 30 day month will quickly eat into any profit they were going to get from Classic. Seems like it would be simpler for them to just use the system already baked into the game that allows players to solve loot problems. Despite the sky is falling nonsense on here it has worked for a long time and never had the kind of widespread abuse people think they will see.
---
Nah, you don’t get to make this about some social issue: the dude is a scam artist taking advantage of the hype. He’s *not* a Vanilla player. Otherwise he’d prove it. 
---
I think that'd be an awesome idea to please all types of people, but since it requires more work and makes too much sense it wont be utilized.
---
Players who are familiar with how the latency is resolved in the Vanilla client can use that to be competitive over their adversaries. It is only luck based in that low skill players will sometimes benefit from spell batching in PvP. This whole argument is again beyond the pale, because it is core to the gameplay of Vanilla and should be replicated in Classic if Ion was being truthful when he said, " If someone in 2004 who was playing Vanilla woke up and played Classic Wow, they would not notice".
---
I understand all the arguments made on the other comments but, I'm always anxious of having a situation in a dungeon where, let's say a leather dps item drops. Both a warrior and a rogue that have a green slot roll. The warrior wins it. Then later a plate piece almost or even as good drops. No one needs it. Therefore you just lost an item for one of the group member for no reason. Like, plate/mail wearer have intrinsecally more choices than the others with that method. Is that fair? I get the cases where for example cloth with + crit fits paladins better, but the example I gave with rogue/warrior there is nothing like that. It's just plain unfair to rogues (and I don't care myself I will play a plate class).
---
Don't you care about such cases?
---
You can "fedex method" the early levels, that is you can explore and 'discover' areas and with that exp level up.
---
But after the very first few levels that's no longer possible. Discovering areas gives about as much exp as a couple of mobs. Harvesting doesn't give exp.
---
It is impossible to get max level without killing mobs.
---
RIP TB man... 
---
So as far as Rare Mobs go, did we just get better or were we that bad in the original that we thought Rares did more?
---
well when u do mc bwl and aq in one night u need them all? and no hunters don't have resist sets
---
BoE's that are needed on are instantly bound to the character and can't be traded. All other BoP loot from dungeon bosses or raids can be traded. 
---
I dunno. I think they only have the 1.12 game engine files, but they probably still have the older database stuff because that's entirely separate and would be backed up separately too, so they could pull older item data, npc spawns, etc off that. 
---
And used a boss from ZA in the thumbnail and he tried to claim he did it on purpose. 
---
&gt; Why denying that loot trading is bad with such arguments? 
---
What I am saying is that, even in the WORST-CASE scenario, your chance of getting an item never drops below 20%. That is not the end of the world.
---
That's very inaccurate unfortunately. I did that all the time back in the day and it was fine. There are shitty tanks whatever their class. Pala tank is more than fine in dungeons. Even in ZG.
---
I think rolling need on an item simply to sell it is far worse.
---
An enchanter rolling need on every item that drops, including bops, makes a stronger argument.
---
&gt;I can't believe some people really think Blizzard cannot set up an internal 1.12 installation.
---
They've already stated that they have a 100% functional 1.12 client working internally, *including the backend.* That means all the loot tables, all the mob values, spawn rates, absolutely everything.
---
You get 1-40 without even going to kalimdor? Why not quest in ashenvale, stonetalon, desolace?
---
You just have to travel more. Go quest in Arathi, Dustwallow, Badlands, Swamp of sorrows etc.
---
imo 40-60 feels a lot faster than 1-40
---
Yes, I know. It's a minor inconvenience. That's my point. 
---
[removed]
---
Except that isn't how it was. Fixing loot problem was a common thing for GM's and blizzard's stance has always been that they would fix said problems. Changing stance after it being the same way for 14 years is not a great idea, and would not solve the issues anyway. You will still have a flood of tickets whenever something is mislooted, and no amount of "We can't fix that anymore" will stop some GM having to open the ticket, look at it, and respond. 
---
The abuse everyone here seems to be sure will happen will not be widespread or common. The system existed for a long time before personal loot made it sort of redundant and there was no real abuse. Some edge cases may happen, but that is dealt with by ignoring that person, calling them a ninja and moving on with your life. Blizz will not spend the money needed to have GM's to fix all these little issues, but with this decision it is clear they don't want to change 14 years of company policy with regards to loot.
---
&gt; In true vanilla with good group composition and without loot trading, its 1 in 2 or 3 chance of getting it.
---
So run the dungeon again. Don't you like playing the game?
---
Maybe these competitive players should learn to be competitive in real time combat  instead of relying on server side lag to artificially buffer and slow the fights down.
---
You know, like every other game.
---
Sssshhhh man, get out of here with your legitimate concerns about classic.  /s
---
I completely agree man, this "news" should have came out the week and at the latest a month after the demo.  It's crazy to me how people think this is amazing and we finally got news. This is not news, at all.  Blizzard shouldn't be pat on the back when they come out with these updates once every half a year, it's ridiculous.  There needs to be stronger communication, but this sub doesn't like that clearly. 
---
They will be able to track how many accounts login to the classic servers so they'll get their data that way for clarifying interest in classic. 
---
I tried it, it seems to work pretty well. If you get spirit tap + spiritual guidance, you can get good +spell damage at the start of the fight as long as you pull the next mob within 30 seconds. This mechanic also has some nuance, because you can decide whether you want max +spell damage, max mana regen, or something in between. So you have a little more to think about while grinding.
---
Honestly thank fuck, creating 30 letters to send your alts items is not something I’m too keen to scream #nochanges for
---
I can argue both sides but didnt they just fire a high-level employee? Likewise, several others after reporting a great year financially?
---
Whatever the case, I just want Classic to be a great game and for everyone involved to have a good time.
---
I was number two when I played. I often felt used back then but thinking of it now, giving is more fulfilling to me and is what I'm best at in this game. Though this time I want stand up for myself and others a little more.
---
1v1 is relevant for wPvP and duels. It's not uncommon to play PvP for those. I for one don't enjoy BG much in vanilla, I play to duel and wPvP and have known many that does the same. So you are basically just acting like an idiot without a point. 
---
This post is stupid. Blizzard has a working copy of vanilla wow, original source code and database and private servers do not.
---
Yeah, most of the weaknesses of BfA are really for people that wants to commit to the game. For casually burning off some time before moving on it is an amazing xpac. Give it a try, I had several months feeling like WoW had finally captured me again (something it had not achieved since cata).
---
Couple things, firstly that is supremely naive as nobody really paid much attention to those "X is a ninja, him and his buddy stole from us in UBRS!" posts since at least half of them were BS and the ninja was calling the other guys ninjas too. Where are you going to put your screenshot and complaint? Can't name and shame on reddit, or the official forums. There is a line of reasoning that with newer policies you may not be able to do it in game chat either. Some few will abuse the system, you ignore them and play with other people. It won't be that widespread, it never was and has existed in the game for a long time. 
---
The right click reporting is a real issue if they have it automatically mute or kick anyone without a GM looking at it first. That is where rage should be directed, since a mute could kill your ability to do much of anything and one large group of douches could cause it through mass reporting just because you did something they don't like.
---
Yes an experienced pala tank might be better than a noob warrior. Still I assume equal gear and equal class knowledge. I have played retail vanilla and private servers, it's very hard to remember a pala tanking especially in raids like zg. 
---
&gt;You are okay with them replicating everything else about Vanilla into Classic
---
Nope
---
Funny, that totally defeats the purpose of the tool. So when you misclick need on that thing you don't even want and can't give it to the guy who needs it you now have to go to the GM's. 
---
I had a human paladin in vanilla, was much closer to the dwarf side here. This is just private server bull crap. 
---
50% btw
---
But he did. Why are you lying? 
---
Players like you will poison the game.  
---
You can scam with the old system too. The leader of a party can easily “scam” people out of a much needed drop. And it happened to me and my friends plenty of times. That’s why re refused to join any group that didn’t have the rules set to need/greed
---
Plot Reading will save Blizzard Money and all will be fine, relax dude
---
"Because it is an upgrade" is not a reason as to why it should be yours. 50g is an upgrade to everyone. I don't know at this point if you're just trolling or you're just really gready but you better get used to it because that's how it's gonna be in classic.
---
This is part of why you attack the boss from behind as DPS
---
if they parry your attack they’ll slap the shit out of the tank
---
Ironically the loot trading thing being in might make the BoE problem go away as needing on a BoE under the newer system instantly binds it to you so you can't AH it.
---
What happened to then?
---
You earn minimal XP from exploring and none from nodes. You can do non-combat quests (deliver X item to Y NPC) but that’s pretty limited. 
---
Doing every non-combat quest caps out before level 10 as horde and before 15 as alliance. 
---
You aren’t pulling Doubleagent shenanigans in Classic. 
---
Haven't you read the latest blue post? There was so many shit proven wrong because the community didn't remember right and reported "bugs" that were in fact, not bugs.
---
Ever heard of anecdotal evidence?
---
you do you man, I think that crazy time will be 90% fun 10% crap.   
---
but its the crap that brings people together
---
They fired the exact people who would waste time mowing loot around
---
And they vires developers of content instead

I took a giant dump this morning, and it said Classic will release in July.  I thanked it before I flushed it.
---
Dude :-/ 
---
You're usually one of the reasonable people on this subreddit. 
---
&gt;Blizzard has a working copy of vanilla wow, original source code and database
---
Why were there so many inconsistencies and bugs in the Classic demo? (far more inconsistencies than pservers, not even comparing)
---
Yeah they fired GM's, the guys who would be dealing with loot issues. But in the end they are going to cut costs places, but it is necessary if we want them to see this as a cash positive game and not introduce nonsense like cash shop items.
---
Time will tell.
---
As long as everyone is having a good time then.
---
If you carry all of those on you at the same time, that's on you. You could easily make the swap out at the bank in-between raids, and you know that. Just because you make things difficult on yourself doesn't mean the entire player base of that class does the same. 
---
r/divorce
---
Exactly
---
Thats ok, noone cares about your opinion anyway lol
---
The real question is, why would you do this?
---
Uh, no. No fucking way. Pservers are *not* closer to Vanilla than the 1.12 codebase they’re working off.
---
First off, it’s the known bugs that don’t get fixed on pservers because devs are working for free. Like the /sit macros, which completely distort the viability of certain specs, like Fury Warrior and Ret Paladin. 
---
From what I recall, it wasn’t until recently, on a current pserver, that SotC was finally fixed to lower your weapon damage as indicated on the tooltip. 
---
It wasn’t until last year that Consecration scaled with Int and not with Strength. This bug had lasted a decade in the code core that all the major pservers used. 
---
Secondly, there’s the stuff pservers will never know. 
---
To this day *no one* except the people working on current Classic actually know how much armor elites and raid bosses had. 
---
Anyone correct me if I’m wrong, but the only guesstimate was an old video of a hunter inspecting a boss (I’ve never played hunter so I’m probably butchering this explanation) and it showed the armor rating. But no one knew if that was the armor rating for just that boss or for all bosses in the game. 
---
So what did the core code programmers do? They just made all bosses have that armor rating because fuck it, beats making up arbitrary numbers. Except it’s been hotly debated that no, bosses had different armor ratings. Since no one has access to that data, a compromise had to be made. 
---
Another thing I like about the bluepost is the fact that they have the actual data, which will run up against all the myriad ways in which players misremember the game. 
---
Google the 80-page Post-Mortem by the N server guys. It shows you all the places where they just guess at mechanics. Sometimes educated guesses, sometimes not. 
---
Players also have terrible memory. Go read the ridiculously passionate posts by players here and on the official forums regarding the demon summoning issue. 
---
If we didn’t have access to the actual 1.12 code we’d think they must be remembering accurately—otherwise why be so confident. Lol, everyone is confident when they misremember shit. 
---
So no, this idea that pservers somehow have access to data that nobody else has is ridiculously misinformed.
---
This is not just making a small code change, terrains and models are assigned a texture and would have to make modifications to every single model which would cost development time that could be used on way more important sections.
---
You mean you tried it out, found some content you enjoyed and stuck with it (or not)? Instead of leveling to 100 and wondering where are all of the people that played that content 5 years ago are? Or basing your opinion off of teenagers (literally and emotionally) on reddit without actually trying it? And you were downvoted? Shocking. Stop trying to be a reasonable person.
---
actually  about 70% of those quests require a pre-requisite that involves killing something.
---
I completely agree. From what I’ve seen so far, I sincerely doubt that Classic will have the authenticity of current private servers. There will be a million little things wrong with Classic. But there won’t be a wake up call, because people will choose to ignore most of the faults. They will shill for blizzard and say this is how vanilla was, you’re remembering it wrong, private servers have clouded your memory etc etc. 
---
The only people who will be disappointed with Classic are private server players who are used to playing a carbon copy of vanilla and now have to settle with Classic. 
---
Scratch that, I did do some questing in Desolace. Totally forgot about that. And you can add Hillsbrad to the previously mentioned group of zones. That’s about it though. For the most part I stick to Eastern Kingdoms and just grind some mobs in STV for a level or two if need be. For whatever reason, Stonetalon and Ashenvale never appealed to me. They feel like Horde-centric zones which puts me off from visiting them I guess...not to mention their aesthetics and atmosphere are a lot less enjoyable. That was the main reason I hated Desolace!
---
That’s part of the problem for me. It gets tiresome having to constantly go back and forth on boats and do 30 minute runs to get new flight paths, only to get a total of say 4-5 new quests before I gotta make another trek. But I guess that’s inevitable after a certain level and just a part of the Vanilla experience. Places like Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow, and Arathi just don’t seem to have a ton of quests, at least from what I noticed when I checked them out for a bit on my last character. 
---
Or blizz doesn't research as fervently as pserver devs do because all they care about is getting your money and not authenticity.
---
Holy spam dude you dont have to send the same post 4 times holy shit lol
---
not gonna lie, that got me excited.
---
Getting my head around this. 
---
Besides PUG raids, it's only a problem in dungeons if there are 3 classes capable of using the gear that drops. How often does that happen? 
---
The most likely scenario I can think of would be a priest, mage and warlock.
---
[Goblin Sapper charges](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10646)
---
Just a small thing I noticed reading your reply. How exactly is Consecration scaling with Intellect, an attribute, instead of Strength, another attribute? Or are you thinking of spellpower and attackpower?
---
Vanilla WoW is returning.
---
Official Blizzard Pre-Expansion servers will be (hopefully) released early this Summer.
---
Blizzard are releasing the original version of wow again in summer.
---
Who's that white dude behind him? His conjoined twin?
---
I mean, I'm with you that most tauren are chill, just, the druids can really be hit or miss.
---
RIP me, you’re right, I meant Spell Power. Ditto for SoR, which nobody knows for sure if it scaled with Spell Power or not, so on current pservers it doesn’t. 
---
&gt; Why were there so many inconsistencies 
---
A bunch of them had already been fixed but didn't make it to the demo(HP and Rogue energy gen).  Version control issue. Another one of the issues was something they'd previously fixed, but the fix didn't work consistently when tested in the demo.  All it means is programming tends to results in bugs and these bugs are discovered during testing and then fixed.
---
&gt;and bugs in the Classic demo?
---
Wait, do you think software development is a bug-free process?  Unlike private server developers, they can easily check the original source code when they're not sure how something should work and then implement it.  Private servers often how no idea how it worked because they don't have the code and they have no reference game to test it on.
---
&gt;(far more inconsistencies than pservers, not even comparing)
---
LOL, wut?  The private server I've been playing on has endless pet, zeplin, warrior, node spawn problems.  They didn't even get the speed of most of the mobs right.
---
what 1.12 codebase?
---
they have imported vanilla models into the current build and have to manually key in shit like regen , crit , slowfall mechanics.
---
Im sure they will do a much better job than private servers because they have access to the data but i dont think there will be many or any lines of 1.12 code in classic wow
---
Sadly many people on this subreddit has put their faith into blizzard, regardless of what they’ve done. I completely agree with your post but people have not woken up yet, but they will hopefully do so when “classic” launches..
---
&gt;Pservers are not closer to Vanilla than the 1.12 codebase the Classic devs are working off.
---
This was never the claim. *Classic WoW* is less authentic than pservers. We're obviously not referring to the actual 1.12 client they have running internally.
---
Downvote me to oblivion 
---
So many corporate apologists in here, makes me fucking sick.
---
&gt;It’s safe to say there will be a million little things wrong with Classic. But there won’t be a wake up call, because people will choose to ignore most of the faults.
---
The general userbase of this sub (retail players and TBC/WotLK players) are so ignorant it can be disappointing.
---
Thankfully there are popular community figures that are clearly genuine fans and very knowledgeable. Hopefully Activision Blizzard will allow the needed dev resources to make Classic WoW at least 95% as accurate as pservers.
---
I mean the classic community consistently loses its mind about everything so it's no surprise. 
---
A lot of people ACTUALLY believe that it's better for classic to launch with no system in place to help the load of players that will be logging into the starting zones and that it well be nostalgia similar to vanilla release... You know not being able to play. And this same community gets upset at the idea of sharding existing only in the starting zones in the first week of play. 
---
Blizzard wants to foster and create an authentic experience it seems very obvious to me and anyone paying attention with a brain. But they aren't just going to do a launch that fucks everyone. They want people to be playing and having fun and spreading the word about how awesome classic is, not waiting in a queue or servers going down. 
---
And I trust me I get it. Us vanilla junkies are going to wade through any potential troubles when it comes to launch and are going to play the shit out of it. But normies won't. And as someone that wants to see classic grow and maintain itself for years we need outside people who aren't obsessed to play and stick with it. 
---
If that means sharding for starting zones for the first week or so then I'm down. 
---
The 1.12 codebase that they recovered from backups with the accurate algorithms, calculations (remember when haste and threat were recalculated differently over the course of Vanilla) and the actual data tables. 
---
Already the algorithms are going to be a huge part of the code incorporated, so your claim that “not much data will be used” is a silly claim to make. 
---
And in end game, valuable herbs/devilsaur is just so locked down on private servers due to population
---
Waaaa me want to be snowflake
---
hunters, rogues, warriors, paladins
---
I've been in dungeons from WC all the way up to Mara where the "tank" was actually a shaman/hunter and lock combo with pets/whatever. So I have no doubt Paladin can clear anything 5 man. As long as people understand aggro mechanics (let the tank hit the boss a bit before jumping in, delay heals for the same reason) and how to CC and prioritize mob kills, I don't think there will be anything too difficult.
---
Same! Another horde Aussie here!
---
Oce as well and going horde, since I way prefer the vanilla races for horde. I find the alliance ones boring
---
Look, I know that getting screwed by an unscrupulous loot trader would suck. It would feel bad. But the bottom line is that you still have a minimum 20% of winning the item so it's not like the end of the world. And let's be real, the chances of there being huge swathes of players exploiting the loot trading system is almost zero.
---
There are definitely bigger problems in the game than this, like mainly the large contingent of players who seem to equate "boe" with "free ninja".
---
And masturbate.  And poop/pee.
---
Showering gets skipped unless it's combined with masturbating.
---
oh really. I had no idea. That actually sounds like a great side effect of loot trading. 
---
&gt; Miyamoto once made a comment to the affect that a game released too soon will always be garbage. 
---
Yep:
---
"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is bad forever." - Miyamoto
---
I don't know what year its from. But I like the attitude of not wanting to ship a terrible game then trying to fix it with a million day 1 patches, lol.
---
They have said they will probably be using sharding for the first couple weeks when starting zones are flooded, but stressed that this will be for a limited time only. So don't listen to all the idiots saying sharding hasn't been addressed and is going to ruin vanilla.
---
Means if you have two warriors in the group and they are together they both roll need even though only one needs. If the other guy wins he passes it to his buddy. You will never know, since he was eligible and it is normal for him to roll. Much of the endgame loot is good for several classes, so it will be hard on most items to know if the rolls were legit or not.
---
It's just standard Holy/Reckoning PvP. You can find it online.
---
And it’s disingenuous to pretend that “scamming” people of loot didn’t exist in vanilla. It certainly did happen. If anything loot trading makes it more fair because it’s a chance for players to undo some scamming people like the OP do (but obviously don’t consider it scamming because they’re the ones doing it)
---
I mean, either way it's pretty cringe.
---
I'm one of those idiots expecting the Vanilla server to actually be Vanilla. 
---
No sharding. 
---
"I think theres a bit too much that they missed, I hope they are starting to 'hunker down' and really start to push these issues further, I think some of these things should not have been missed, but that's just me, I'm not a developer.
---
The last thing is, they didnt say anything about loot trading, about sharding, these are the most important issues in the Classic WoW community, cash shop.
---
We have to pressure them, not in a (sic; a bad way), in a good way, but try to make sure they (Blizzard) answer those questions"

---
I don't know enough about BiS to know if leather would be.  
---
Weapons could be. Personally if I'm going for a low drop BiS, I won't bring along a competing class.
---
So change 14 years of blizzard policy because you are a douchebag and have douchebag friends? Seems like an overreaction when we could instead just put you on ignore and never have to deal with you ever again.
---
&gt; You make it seem like everyone and their mother is gonna scam loot away from you, all because it's possible for them to.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That's en extremely pessimistic view of the community.
---
Im guessing these guys come from private servers. Available to all forms of disgusting, moral less, brigand from across the globe. 
---
Some suppppper slimy shit goes down in the wild wild west of Pservers man. You'll have no faith in humanity after extended time there. 
---
For leveling dungeons, warrior tanks will always be in high demand. In raids they're still needed for tanking, as well as for large amounts of melee DPS. 
---
Since you probably already knew that though, Warlocks on Alliance  (especially on a PVP server) will also be in relatively high demand, since Forsaken's WOTF racial makes their lives more miserable. 
---
I've run with 2 mages, a lock and a priest with a paly healer. In that case, everyone rolls... even the paly on a cloth chest. 
---
ActiBlizz is a mega-billion dollar publicly traded corporation, so the question about "shady shit" happening behind the scenes is already answered.
---
Shady business practices are happening every second of every day.  But since it's a large corporation and we're paying a monthly subscription fee, we just accept it.
---
I don't know why private server players expect the server owners to be a bunch of angels.
---
How is loot trading any different than changing the loot rules as group leader to be able to give your friend(s) loot at your discretion?
---
The truth is that we don't know how big a change it would be, and that it wouldn't offer much benefit to us. That's why it's best to just say that we don't want it. Worst case scenario is that it becomes a mandate to cheat or be cheated. God knows there's plenty of corporate and criminal precedent for otherwise honest people feeling cheating because of competitive pressure. 
---
In early Cata I saw people roll need on things they didn't need *in case* somebody rolled need on something they wanted later. At the end of the dungeon or raid people would then trade loot. I also saw people roll need on items and then offer to trade them to somebody who *actually* needs it in exchange for the highest bid. People would stand in Hagara the Stormbinder's platform and make deals.
---
Isn't rolling on what can't be equipped server suicide? A player would get blacklisted.
---
Well no-one \*will\* notice. I bet you that there's fewer than a thousand of the people who played wow back then who knew about spell batching at all. For everyone else, nothing has changed; it still works the way everyone thought it did.
---
This reminded me of my guild in Vanilla, we were pretty late to any progression and still working through MC when I hit 60 and got my spot. We had a husband and wife pair in our guild, dwarf pally and priest, with these adorably heavy midwestern accents. The pally's armor looked pretty cool to me but I didn't really know anything back then.
---
Took me a long time to realize he was in full Judgement gear from his previous guild and joined us to help his wife's guild get started :')
---
you are mistaken if you think they can just import 1.12 code into the modern client.
---
if they could do that all those minor things would be identical 
---
im sure they have access to the original code and id be surprised if they dont actually have it playable internally to test things.
---
but classic is a manual replication of the 1.12 client , its the modern client modified to replicate 1.12.
---
Astute observation.
---
Worgen druids are canonically the best druids. They were old druids that became insane extradimensional wolf monsters or something. And then they bit some guy and he became a wolf monster too. Or something I dunno. So now you're a person who can turn into a wolf who can turn into a bear. The only part that sucks is running Shadowfang Keep until that key drops to unlock the race. I for one look forward to playing a Horde Worgen Druid again, just like the old days. So unfair that they backpedaled and gave them to the Alliance later.
---
Are you saying warlocks will be more in demand because most warlocks will choose to be forsaken?
---
Overall it will not be an issue like people seem to think. Those clothies rolling on leather, or plate, or melee stuff will be added to ignore and you leave the group. You won't generally run into those people, so the few times you do you ignore and move on, never dealing with that person and perhaps never their guild again.
---
The instant gratification generation sucks. 
---
Yeah, gonna change the game a lot now that your demons disappear when you start the cast for another one and not at the end of the cast. 
---
Depends on the item and the level. Early levels, I'd talk to but forgive a player (since they are new). Later levels with valuable, hard to find items... yeah, I'd chew him a new one and, if he's properly contrite, I'd trade chat spam his ass into oblivion.
---
Otherwise, a player can claim they made a mistake and apologize profusely (hard to judge their sincerity with text chat).
---
Besides that, just say the magic words: I'm an enchanter..
---
Yeah they changed it sometime back (I don't remember when) to avoid issues like you are seeing over BoE loot need rolled to be sold. I don't know that they will do that, the system might be different for classic, but that is how it stands right now.
---
Yeah, all of that sucks. What we'll have to do is put those people on our "do not group" list and move on. We can't prevent people from being jerks and we can't predict who the jerks will be. All we can do is respond by giving them one less person to group with. 
---
The nice thing is that most of the min-maxers will be in specific guilds on the server and so it will be easier to identify who to not group with.
---
Hey bud congrats on unlocking the OPs point. Why would you risk going with people you don't know when there is potential they can screw you over? It will make people less likely to meet new people and become buds.
---
moo
---
Shaman. Most Horde raids want 8 and they aren't that popular.

Tell us how you really feel

Very good

Why, why, why. Who enjoyes leveling up every time you swing your weapon... I would never resubmit before Classic is announced.

FOURTEEN:TWENTYAIGHT AAHAHAHAHAAHAHA

You're still trading money now for no benefit. 
---
What does pre ordering get you other than less money right now?
---
I'm thinking of maybe subbing 2 or 3 days before Classic drops, I'm sure their website will suffer all the people coming back but that said Classic is still 3-6 months out

Yeah pretty much. Anybody who wants to run ret needs to minmax the fuck out of everything they do or they're gonna fall miserably behind. Going Dwarf either proves you're the manliest fuck around for taking so many disadvantages and overcoming, or a total noob who doesnt know how to assess their class and racials. 
---
Really? The starting zones not being a laggy mess for the first couple weeks is taking nothing away from vanilla. 
---
that Heroine was BOE your fucking supposed too!
---
Prot Warriors, Dwarf Priests, and Resto Shamans. 
---
Feel like I was pretty clear. If you are going to abuse a system you are the problem not the system.
---
Nah nah nah that shit is for amateurs. The correct choice is actually
---
Tauren.
---
The problem with paladin tanking is that it's less reliant on the paladin than it is on the group. If people people know how to accommodate a paladin tank it is entirely viable for all 5 mans. The reality is that most people are impatient and stupid.
---
not really, just private servers
---
Just like REAL LIFE! 
---
Oh was that the only difference between them?
---
you can still tryhard with memespecs and do really well. A lot of the accusations of 'memespec' are hyperbole. All classes can meet all dps checks. Play well and build your character with intent and you'll be fine. 
---
Private servers also have missing defense on the vast majority of tanking gear.. people seem to think not defense capped is A-OK until BWL? What the fuck? I distinctly remember being defense capped before even stepping foot in MC.
---
Can’t wait for people to realize what classic was really like 
---
It's not fair during the leveling process if a plate/mail hybrid spec loots it for their healing spec and you loot it for your LEVELING and healing spec. You have more usage for it and it's a pure AC determinate. That's just my opinion tho
---
There would be no system to abuse if all loot is final. You just won't be able to whine to blizzard when you forgot to turn on master looter and someone ninja'd your pre-BiS.
---
This is a wild amount of speculation that is entirely unfounded.
---
Of course I hope you're right but this is a classic reddit detective move. Congrats you earned the badge
---
Why are all these sandcrawlers hoarding wold dicks? There aren't even any wolves in this zone!
---
It's rather annoying to play Alliance WL because the Forsaken characters all have WOTF, which makes it frustrating to play. So a) it's more annoying to play a WL as Alliance, which means that they're more likely to pick another class if they're set on playing Alliance and b) if people really want to play WL but don't care as much about the faction, they're more likely to pick Horde. Both resulting in less Alliance WLs
---
People love to rationalize and they will rationalize this all day. Just don't give someone the option.
---
Interestingly enough,
---
This guy made a post about a month ago about how he hopes they will continue on to add content up to Cataclysm, since it was his favourite expansion.
---
You know, that expansion that completely eliminated any remaining Vanilla content? Yeah, that one.
---
Here's one of his replies to a comment on that post:
---
"I'm sure Activision Blizzard is capable of designing content for Vanilla within these design goals. I trust them to add content to or alter Vanilla 100%."
---
Dat be a troll, mon.
---
Ret has a handful of offensive spells. It's just in a wierd spot, because it has so many SP coefficients and needs spell and physical crit. 
---
Considering how many people in this subreddit apparently feel entitled to ninja-need on BOEs, now I'm wondering how much opposition to loot trading is taking that into consideration.
---
I was about to challenge you thinking you were going to say the actual quests listed involved killing something. But yes, I do believe you are absolutely right, my dude.
---
Love that pumpkin quest.
---
Yes, they could extrapolate that logic to such a ridiculous degree. And yet, I doubt they will. 
---
So you’re arguing pointless semantics?
---
Got it. 
---
But mandala effect is likely cause of why private server devs scripted it that way
---
if you're not gonna pay attention to what blizzard says they're doing in classic, don't post about classic.
---
I like tips out :(
---
Why specifically dwarven priests?
---
*spams subreddit with annoying podcast*
---
Resto shaman, I assume?
---
PvP: Horde not-shadow Priests
---
(please)
---
Makes sense.
---
In their defense, Blizzard did give it to them. 
---
It’s like if I gave my four-year old son a cookie and then took it away. He would cry. But if I never gave him the cookie, he’d probably be fine. Still a good chance he’d whine for a cookie randomly and repeatedly, but it definitely wouldn’t be as bad of a whine as if I had given it and taken it away.
---
And you feel qualified to make such an observation? I feel like you're not realizing the majority of the community doesn't interact with you, or hell even post on this sub.
---
Man, redditor delusion is a bitch. 
---
Because fear ward. If you play anything other than dwarf priest on alliance you’re doing it wrong. At least for raiding.
---
Because they have Fear Ward. In Vanilla every other boss has some kind of fear mechanic.
---
The problem is its so easy to make it invisible. especially if you share armor. Paladin / Warrior buddies can run a racket. If something like HOJ drops and you are in a pug with a paladin healer / warrior tank. The paladin healer can roll on it and just give it to the warrior. "Need it for my pvp set bros". Instead of it being just you v the warrior.
---
wow sure got em there bud
---
But I love Dwarf Holy Pally. The ultimate anti Rogue. Plate, shields, cleanse, freedom, stoneform.....just laugh at them.
---
Ever heard of 13-15 years of private servers =/= actual vanilla?
---
You’re not telling me anything they didn’t already explain at the Classic Blizzcon panel. 
---
I’m reminding you that algorithms and calculations can be imported into Retail WoW. Or like they explained: Injecting systems like the Pet Happiness code back into Retail (obviously by tweaking some of the connective code.)
---
At the end of the day maths are maths. There’s nothing “special”, like some weird concept of a “soul” in Vanilla that can’t be implemented into retail. 
---
Like the devs have said before (with a sigh of frustration btw) that there is still, shockingly, code from Vanilla in retail to this day. 
---
So we are now going to change how vanilla was and invalidate 14 years of blizzard loot policy? I'd rather stick to vanilla and not have trading but they will not pay for the GM's needed to fix it so this is what we wind up with.
---
Ever heard of 13-15 years of anecdotal evidence?
---
how do I go to the bank? I go to AQ, then hearth to kargath and clear mc and bwl, tell me where do I get access to the bank huh? 
---
Yes. You also have the ability in most cases to roll 30/0/21 which is a sick PvP spec as well. 
---
Fear Ward. And that’s the correct answer. 
---
Warriors are the most needed class in raids as the best Tanks and elite melee DPS. Shaman and Paladins are both needed for buffs, but because Shaman buffs are only for the group, you need more of them. And dwarf priests are needed because priests are the most needed alliance healers and most players role human instead of dwarf even though dwarfs are better because of Fear Ward.
---
But muh dark gods
---
Yes and no. As long as you meet DPS checks and contribute to the success of a run, any player is fine, regardless of spec. You will have bad players on good specs and good players on bad specs. I'd rather have a good ret than a dogshit fury. A good ret can pass the dps check, offer blessings to the entire group, and offheal or use defensive cooldowns on allies as needed. In my experience on Ret 1-60 in PuG dungeons, that ability to pivot to offhealing has saved me and my groups countless wipes. 
---
I clearly wouldn't want a bad player on a bad spec, they're literally dead weight, but a well played character can meet any dps check in the game, regardless of class, excluding elemental resisting bosses on specs that primarily focus on a single element. Ignoring the pros of memespecs and hyperfocusing on the bad is a great way to get a very incorrect view of the situation as a whole. 
---
I guess that’s the issue you’re having. 
---
lol right
---
I'll likely try hard as ret. I like too play the underrated stuff as much as possible. Survival hunter in vanilla and bc until I finally got glory in wotlk. Fury warrior after that. 
---
Definitely not ele, most guilds will probably have 1 or 2 enhancements to buff the warriors and rogues.
---
Elemental is just too mana inefficient to do shit in  a long fight.
---
I was planning to play a Druid but you have me second guessing myself , I’ve done little to no research on ret during vanilla. Can anyone offer some insight ?
---
&gt;Issue you're having
---
I guess by "you" what you mean is me and the approximately 140 people upvoting this thread?
---
What are you going on about?
---
The reason you don’t see a lot of prot warrs is not because people are worried about finding groups, it’s because their lives outside of groups can be miserable — they either need to respec or farm and handle all other content as prot (and they can’t respec because farming as a warrior sucks). Oh and they have the worst repair costs.
---
Are you not aware of what this thread is about?
---
I kinda think beeing ganked by a [insert race] hunter is the worst. As soon as I see "dazed" on my screen I am 180 degrees tilted 
---
&gt;Blizz never stated it would ONLY be at launch.
---
Yes they did. 
---
You just agreed with me that you have 13-15 years of evidence that isn’t vanilla. You’re goofy friend. 
---
With no cross-realm options, the problem you list solves itself. If you group with a guild that bullies you out of a piece of gear, you know not to run with them again. Very quickly they will be known to do that on the server and carry that rep.
---
Whats this about a sit macro messing with viability?
---
Lol leveling and gearing a Balance deuid just for Dueling. 
---
Ahaha. That is hilarious. Good luck gearing that up with actual endgame gear haha. And you have the balls to call me an idiot with that delusional plan?
---
I’m gonna hit you up in a year and see how far this has gotten u haha. 
---
&gt; The problem is its so easy to make it invisible. 
---
Yeah, I do understand that. But there's no rule system that cannot be gamed by unscrupulous players.
---
As a healer, I can see advantages to loot trading. "Hey guys, I'm going to roll NEED on caster items for my dps spec, but if I win an item that the mage also needs, I'll trade it to him since he has dps priority"
---
I think the number of times that loot trading will undo accidental ninja'ing will far outnumber the times greedy players try to game it for advantage.
---
The problems I listed are the problems that have been endlessly repeated since the announcement of loot trading. I completely agree with you that these issues will be minor and that the community alone is enough to deal with any thing that comes up. But, to settle everyone down, it would be nice if loot trading transactions were recorded and that they only take place in raids. 
---
I thought this thread was going to be about Windows XP lol
---
You were quoted on the latest episode of countdown to class on the undercity part of the show, if you didn't know. 
---
It's kind of cancerous though, I'd have to play with /dnd on from all the whispers. Just leveling out in the wilds solo and you'll be flooded with whispers.
---
you can thank them to even have classic
---
Looking forward to playing horde
---
You seem to have smooth brain, so I'll try to make this more clear for you. You suggested that because you have 15 years of experience being a human paladin that means that human paladins can't possibly be a stereotype. However, I am suggesting that your 15 years of experience is irrelevant because it is still anecdotal evidence whether it be 1 year or 15 years. Then you said, "no u," which is a stunningly compelling argument, by the way. To which, I suggested that by "you" - in this case, me - *you* must be referring to not just me but also the majority of the people in this comment thread who are upvoting an image macro about a human paladin stereotype. My reason for pointing that out is that in a way you are correct that the stereotype arises from anecdotal evidence. But the difference is that you have 1 person worth of anecdotal evidence to the contrary of the stereotype, while there is about 150 people worth of anecdotal evidence in support of the stereotype existing - and 150 people worth of anecdotal evidence is not anecdotal at all.
---
Catch the point this time, friend?
---
On pservers you could /sit to force abilities that activated on getting crit. 
---
This hasnt been fixed because either its too hard or the pserver devs can’t be arsed. 
---
This was fixed early on in Vanilla so that you couldn’t /sit to gain a charge of Reckoning, for example. 
---
This makes certain builds/specs that are incredibly powerful and viable on pservers totally nonfunctional in O.G. Vanilla. 
---
I’d link to all the proof and stuff but I’m on my phone. 
---
I kind of want dual specs for this reason. Normally you'd have to run some goofy hybrid spec to PVP/Tank with but you're losing tons of potential.
---
you seem to not be under the impression i'm fully aware of that.
---
Absolutely nowhere did i say it was a "small code change".
---
The OP's delivery could have been more measured, but I think his central point is correct.
---
Private Servers had a lot of values wrong, Blizzard's internal version of 1.12  helps prove that. **BUT** we aren't going to be getting that internal version of 1.12, we will be getting the modern game modified to resemble 1.12 more closely.
---
Owing to this the #NoChanges crowd should really be the #LotsOfChanges crowd. It will take effort to recognize and modify the instances where the modern game differs from 1.12. It's a frustrating task identifying these differences - especially when many peoples views of the 'correct' behavior comes from the dubious pserver implementation.
---
In total, I think it's totally reasonable to expect that the net experience of the best pservers will be closer to vanilla than what Classic will end up providing. For the sake of example I fully expect Classic will have more accurate attribute values for raid bosses, but will the content release schedule in Classic show the same level of granularity as some private servers (still not perfectly Blizzlike, but closer than the most recently announced Blizz plan)?
---
You don’t. My point was VC is for Van Cleef and on certain servers people say DM instead (where DM really means Dire Maul). It’s always been a point of debate and the downvotes I got show that. 
---
Not going to bother reading that wall troll. read what you said in your reply. You said you have 13-15 years of anecdotal evidence that proves your side of this argument. Not vanilla being the case where humans were decursive bots who healed and wore cloth. Good try. 
---
Thats why they post about it so much. With every update, and every passing month, it becomes clear the classic community is going to play and enjoy this project regardless of whether every single minor demand is met, and this clearly bothers people who want the devs to believe that their pet issue is a "line in the sand" that if crossed will kill the project.
---
That's clearly not the case. Loot trading or no, there's no stopping this train.
---

Leveling dungeons: Warrior tanks (don't level as prot though). Druids too because tanks are always needed but you can heal if a group has a tank (although many people don't like druid healers in 5-man - often times not much choice when you've been LF1M for a while). Priests are very valued too but not as in demand as a (good) tank

Raids: Priest, Shaman, Paladin healers. It'll vary from guild to guild whether a priest or a shaman/paladin is more needed but generally you will be in high demand as one of these healers. Warrior tanks are not in high demand since you only need a couple in most cases and there are many people fighting for that job (and it usually goes to people who are incredibly dedicated to the guild because the best gear is funneled to them and the guild relies on those tanks' gear and availability)
---
Battlegrounds: Paladin healers are always going to be wanted. Priests too, but more on Horde. If you're an elite PvPer, almost regardless of class you'll be wanted: hunter/rogue that can defend/pester flags, warrior that can call out targets, druid that can flag carry, mage/warlock/rogue that can burst focus targets and CC properly
---
Overall you're looking at a healer if you want to be very valued in any group play. You have a tougher time in solo content but if you're a social person and like the concept of feeling valued, healers are very fulfilling
---
I see so enrage and reckoning for the most part.
---
Also I doubt those 150 played vanilla. 
---
As a cloth wearer this shit is super annoying to have a enh shaman take the sfk blue belt... In any case it should have gone to one of the three cloth wears in the grp. 
---
To be fair those are very small mistakes, and if the pserver people find a "bug" that isn't one, blizzard just has to double check. Pretty sure pserver players still bring much more info to the table over people who haven't played the game in 13 years.
---
Yea, I’m of the opinion that not every change since Vanilla is evil, but it’s a slippery slope to let someone else decide what changes. I think the big issues are cross-server grouping and mass sharding, but something like free spec changes is fine with me. 
---
&gt; you're here for you, for your enjoyment, not here to be a team player.
---
I always get this so mixed it. Are Vanilla raids going to be so easy that every raid is on farm within 2-3 weeks of release, or are Vanilla raids going to be so hard that everyone needs to min-max their class instead of playing specs they enjoy?
---
what kind of argument is this? What if i roll need on ironfoe as a healer and win the roll to give my friend it instead of you getting cause you were the second highest roller? "Dont you like playing the game?" What. Might as well throw a penny at your face and say "dont you like money?" 
---
Don't worry. I didn't peg you as the type to have much reading comprehension.
---
&gt; wtf blizzard I can't frontstab pls fix
---
Ohh this is going to be a BIG one I imagine.
---
God, Metroid Other M. Who would have thought that hiring Team Ninja, mostly known for their giant booby cheesecake fighting games, to write the OG videogame heroin Samus Aran would turn out badly??
---
Can’t say I’ve ever heard that. I hope to see you calling people melts in the Barrens chat, sir.
---
0 - When asked in the past about class changes, devs have cringed because because they don't want to open a can of worms.
---
They're going to speed level to 60, clear MC with every possible world buff, and then spend the next 3 months on Blizz forums complaining about the lack of content.
---
I was thinking the same. I’ll probably sub the month of.
---
Yep, which sucks because its what prevents me from recommending Kargoz’s YouTube guides for each class. They’re so well done and detailed, but unfortunately he goes hard on recommending builds and hasn’t listened when we tell him that there’s a 99.9% certainty that Classic isn’t going to allow it, because it didnt actually work in Vanilla. 
---
and poopknife
---
Best comment 
---
Should be fine if it ran wod. Just keep shadow quality and view distance on the lowest setting. 
---
It seems like every other hunter I group with is either a chump who runs out of arrows mid dungeon and also meat for his cat, or an absolute champion who saves the day with clever kiting and ice trapping.
---
Fill your quiver up, and then fill up a bit of another bag with some arrows. By the time you need that bag space from all the hyena bollocks you've scavenged or dungeon loot you've picked up, you'll have shot enough arrows to clear it up for you.
---
Remake this as classic and u get an upvote
---
&gt; fogged their memory.
---
Or they just never played vanilla originally anyway. I guarantee that's the case for most. A *lot* of people here have ideas about vanilla that were never actually a thing back then...
---
This
---
&gt; How ironic.
---
GOD_DAMN.GIF
---
You’re totally right. They can obviously see who is playing what. I do think knowing how many people will actually start a sub JUST for Classic is an important number for Blizzard to know. I think this is because a lot of retail players will check Classic out but would have been subbed regardless. This is a good opportunity to say”I will NOT sub to WoW in its current state but have a passion for Vanilla.” 
---
Will it make a difference? Probably not. Maybe Blizzard will try to make a change to retail here and there to make the game seem pure to its roots. However, I think it is much more likely for game devs to see the success of Classic and say “Maybe there still is a market for a true MMO and not this micro transaction-filled mess.”
---
&gt; what kind of argument is this? 
---
It's an argument that people are getting worked up over almost nothing. Even if everyone is conspiring against you, you still have a 20% chance of winning the item. And if you don't win the item, the worst possible scenario is that you'll get another 20% chance the next time you run the dungeon.
---
Oh no, the horrors! I might have to run Scholo multiple times to get Cadaverous Armor. Oh wait, I was going to do that anyway even *after* I get the armor.
---
Yea its fine to skip some zones 1-40, especially if you do a few instances. 40-60 is when you need to start moving around a lot more and trying to do every quest.
---
Quests can be hard to find, or they are part of long chains which span multiple zones. Swamp of sorrows is mostly for horde but those other  zones have around 15-20 quests you can do. Use a leveling addon or guide, or check classic.db  https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/
---
I always adored the Alliance pvp weapons. Grand Marshal’s Claymore and Grand Marshal’s Stave were my favorite.
---
And of course the legendary’s were all awesome. Seeing people with Thunderfury is always amazing. But just imagine getting Thunderfury yourself. 
---
Same dog so badass
---
Nah, I'm not convinced. The demo wasn't meant to be taken seriously, they put that together hastily for blizzcon. They've had 6+months to work on it. I don't see the need for a beta because the gameplay is fixed, there's nothing to test in that sense. You just gotta match all the values and numbers to the 1.12 patch. 
---
I feel like In-house testing should be enough to work out the biggest technical problems that might occur.
---
I hope they keep the concurrent cap at 2500. I could see the first two weeks being a little higher but I’d like to see familiar realm sizes to Vanilla.
---
Again I disagree. My statement with clothies are the simplest case. Thats as simple as old ninjaing and open and shut, but for vanilla you have classes that actually use the other gear types. So you can't always figure it out.
---
In other expansions you see cases of tanks rolling for DPS gear, healers for DPS/Tank gear etc... It is justifiable in a sense, because if you don't reserve something you can't complain but it still leaves a sour taste in ones mouth if 2+ people stack the deck vs you. 
---
I've been playing WoW in private servers, and retail for probably a decade straight. It happens much more often than you think. I've been on both ends. I've been in the dick party run that needs a pug or 2 and stacks the deck vs them on an item they need and I've gotten my shit taken away. It happens so often that I am of the belief a simple blacklist will not be enough to police it. When it becomes so commonplace I don't think people bat an eye at it in the end. 
---
Either way I'd rather not have it put in the game and stir up doubt when joining a group. 99% of the time when you join a group you think *"sweet, gonna have some fun and maybe get some loot"*. With loot trade ninjaing potentially being a thing i'm going to be thinking *"should I waste my hour hoping for my low drop only to then have a chance for me to have a 33% chance to get it??"* or *"can I trust this group?"*. To me that is not what vanilla should be about but if it is implemented we'll see how it goes, but i'm of the opinion it will be bad for the game.
---
Ret is pretty much useless in all capacities, however Classic is going to be much easier this time around so it genuinely doesn't matter. 
---
Nice attempt at Karma whoring repost.

---
Played a human paladin in vanilla. Holy spec from an early level as I figured out that everyone would help a healer who would help them. Solo questing took awhile but I never had an issue getting into a dungeon. 
---
&gt; It’s still a change though. It’s not authentic, no matter how you spin it.
---
No one cares, no private servers ever had spell batching working correctly either. In fact only 2 servers try to emulate it. Neither of them are vanilla wow, and neither of them have batching working properly either.
---
So no one gives a crap.
---
It breaks my heart that this question seems so “alien” in current gamers. We’ll waste any small amount on any micro transaction thrown at us now :(
---
Not necessarily "something to look out for," as it wasn't particularly great by any means... but two items that hold a special place in my heart are the [Phantom Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7961) and the [Embrace of the Lycan](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9479) from ZF.
---
I remember being mid-40s leveling my very first character, a Rogue.  I had recently gotten my mount and found a cloak with a cool, longer model... I scrounged up the mats to have my Blacksmithing friend make me a Phantom Blade, and I won the Embrace in a ZF run.  For the first time in my WoW career, I looked at my character and thought *"wow, this guy is starting to look pretty badass!"*  The hat had more character to it than the other random helmets I had found, the Phantom Blade sheathed on your character model's back instead of at their side, and the first long cape I had all came together for just a really cool look.  Riding around my skeletal horse, I was finally starting to feel like a stronger character and not a noob.  It's a pretty great memory.
---
The post is more pointed at people who hate retail but for some reason, are subbing now so they can play Classic. 
---
Do it bro. I will be.
---
*played tauren shaman during retail vanilla- 
---
Yeah no, I’m not into pegging, but if you like it that’s between you and whoever is tapping it in the hole Happy. 
---
Like... WoW? 
---
One thing I like about Vanilla questing is how so many random quests turn into important chains. With modern WoW a guy can be like "collect 20 bear asses. Got em? Thanks, here's 20g and some exp." It just doesn't feel like it matters. In Vanilla a lot of those random quests turn into "Oh you brought my bear asses back? Great, here's some silver. Now I can use these bear asses to make the bear ass potion you'll need to summon the Primal Lord of all Bears, Ursulus the Grizzled, inside the dungeon you'll be going to anyway in 5-10 levels. Return his hide and choose between 3 blue items."
---
are you a blizzard employee
---
Engineering trinkets: net and frost/fire/shadow reflectors. 
---
I don’t think so but I had heard a bunch of rumors. I am fairly certain WoW classic is “free” if you have a retail WoW sub.(it’s still $15)
---
We're talking about PUGs, you dunce. Guilds have literally nothing to do with the conversation. L2read.
---
Yep, if the dps is on point paladin tanking is possibly the best in a 5 man. HOWEVER if you have a single dipshit dps the whole thing falls apart.
---
I'm curious - why ditch the imp healing wave?
---
I actually quit in WotLK but for a totally different reason. I was spending all of my time playing! ... but a friend bought me one sub as long as I did 1 BG... I played a lot more than just one BG that day.
---
I can totally agree halfway... If the Shaman had a piece of crap belt, can you really blame them for rolling on a belt that is a major upgrade? To really complain confidently, you'd have to be able to say "Hey man, there is actually a leather belt from this other boss that has the same or better stats, could you not roll on this one please?" And when they do roll need, because they dont intend on going after that leather belt, there's not much right to complain other than at the game makers for designing armor types. The fact that clothies can only wear cloth is a negative aspect to playing them, that is indeed meant to limit your ability to use gear, and extenuate other classes ability to use any type of armor they want. You're paying a tax for playing a clothie essentially. And it's completely fair to a degree like I mentioned.
---
I wish I could say the same but I can’t. I bought every expansion except BFA, hit max, and then realized the game sucked after the first raid tier and quit.
---
What do you mean by "No hunter weapon dropped". If a weapon dropped, it is a hunter weapon. So it should be "no weapon dropped".
---
&gt;no private servers ever had spell batching working correctly
---
Trolling or...?
---
They do man. I mean there are even people in this thread who said they sub’d already.
---
Let me rephrase. Why would I spend $15 just to get upset and crave vanilla EVEN MORE!?
---
Enhancement gives like 10 more strength to the melees and is a dead weight. They have piss poor damage and the single worst uptime on Nightfall on top of wasting debuff slots if they use Stormstrike. 
---
They aren’t just a bad hybrid spec, they’re the worst of all hybrid specs for PVE. Even prot/ret pallies are more useful. 
---
Haha I knew what you mean. I know I took what you said out of context but couldn’t help it seeing the innocent satirical value of the question.
---
Imagine being so mentally ill that you think that some losers on a forum for bootleg servers that aren't blizzlike represent the classic community, check out what people say on THIS forum and you'll see that you're wrong.
---
No facts, shit I included the link from the very man who brought spell batching to our attention. Feel free to go and tell the guy whose research you are using in your argument that his results are wrong...
---
Or you can just ask the server GM's in discord. NO PRIVATE SERVERS HAVE PROPER SPELL BATCHING WORKING AS OF TODAY PERIOD.
---
Thats why I laugh at this argument. You guys only make it because you thought it was a leg up in your Private Server vs Blizzard Server fight; but you didnt listen to the man behind the research... No private server even has this shit working, so your whole approach is shit to begin with.
---
I don’t know that. Until I get some kind of proof showing otherwise, I can’t believe it.
---
100%. Once the game is out, the people craving classic wow will just obviously play it instead. They'll then start to find people who're actually good at the game, like monkeynews, etc. (Though I don't expect MN to make how to videos.)
---
Your link is literally some random guy who did all his “research” on terrible stock TBC servers
---
I think you got downvoted because you pointed out an "obvious" thing but didn't think about what the context of the obviousness was.
---
They are talking about the idea of a slower paced combat that rewards consistency within the combat and tenacity to keep along with the grind to complete each quests. Each fight has the possibility of tipping out of your favor, such as if you pull too many enemies or if you mismanaged your health or mana. The consistency in fights lets you use your abilities efficiently, and tenacity makes or breaks your focus in a fight.
---
The more recent expansions, while being the same types of quests, are very fast paced and can be done in a line all at once generally. The way combat is balanced in the early game causes you to be able to one shot some enemies with some classes abilities, while later game many classes just use one ability over and over (not saying some classes in classic didn't do this, but there was less prevalence). The combat and quests lining up the way they do is to cause the euphoria of completing a task be faster and faster, but it ends up cheapening the experience (double meaning ftw) making the leveling feel like a slog despite being faster.
---
Also I remember pretty frequently the feeling of "yeah we're all fucked here, but if I can manage to take out that caster mob it will be easier next time".
---
I mean...it makes sense that it would work on those spells. Reflecting the part of it that hit you, like 1/10 of the dmg and effect back to the caster.
---
I actually thought about subbing for the same reason. Makes totally sense to want to pay for what you are playing.
---
You want them all as a druid, net, reflectiors, invisibility, mark of tyranny, nifty stopwatch, arena grandmaster if u can get it, pvp trinket, rune of metamorphosis, zg trinket, tidal charm etc.
---
I want my main to be a Lock, but god damn I NEED to level in Teldrassil.
---
ps - I am not doing the boat run since I want to attempt to get ahead of the game
---
Unless you’re in a severely undergeared or struggling progression raid, or if you’re in a caster group, no one will notice 
---
So anyone with an opinion is not allowed to say it unless they're qualified? Mate, you're the epitome of reddit with comments like that.
---
classic r/wow joke rip off. well done.
---
My link is from the same guy who originated the research, and also who tested it EVERYWHERE. But we don't need to argue. 
---
Go ahead and name the private server you think has spell batching implemented properly so I can quickly prove it wrong and laugh.
---
Remember, you asked for this. Go ahead.
---
I think there’s a pretty good chance they’ll add them 3-6 months in when the overwhelming majority of players is asking for them and no one is pvp-ing or tanking.
---
I respect your opinion and support your sub if you enjoy it. I did not buy BFA because I wanted to wait until the honeymoon phase was over and reassess. 
---
I did not like Legion for a lot of reasons. It has aspects that I think are great (Mythic+), but it just doesn’t seem like an RPG anymore. BFA doesn’t to seem to have the answer I am looking for.
---
So I’m gonna wait to sub until Classic and not use retail to fill my time until then.
---
I hear ya man. Tell them with your wallet!
---
Same for bear Druids. They're amazing dungeon tanks.
---
Actually no hes right. It doesn't mean that it shouldnt be pursued for classic. Thats a subjective opinion. But he is right that no Private Servers to day have accurately reproduced spell batching. As far as I know 3 have tried with varying results, but none accurate.
---
Dwarf Priest (fear ward), Ally lock (having 40% of the enemy faction with a free trinket against your CC is enough that the ally lock population is usually pretty low), Resto shaman (you want one for every 5 man in a raid, so 8).
---
To a lesser extent resto druid, they aren't a very popular class overall and you want a few in your raid.
---
its 9 seconds, but yeah, you're right.
---
*unless they decide that that was cancerous and remove it when Classic launches---because it seems pretty cancerous....
---
sweet! experiencing wow for the first time is always something magical, so that's a good choice :D
---
haha that's so true, i stand corrected
---
not as a paladin
---
“Accurate” is a pretty relative word and this whole argument is just a straw man anyway.
---
Go watch any Neilyo or Vurtne movie from retail Vanilla and you’ll see lots and lots of spell batching.
---
No spell batching = change. Period.
---
&gt; Can't wait for this sub to explode with bullshit posts of "X is wrong" after Classic comes out because people "know" it different from private servers, retail or simply forgot how it really worked back then.
---
Im thinking this will happen too for the first few months at least. Theres going to be sooo many videos from classic posted to prove stuff right. Bring back Warcraftmovies.com man.... 
---
I always thought Zin'Rokh looked awesome
---
as a paladin, yes.
---
Of course. There are plenty of bis cloth items for druids,shamans and paladins. Robes of the exalted from baron rivendare comes to mind. You will see plenty of paladins and shamans running round in their cloth dresses.
---
No. I am a normal human being with a life that doesn't revolve around obsessing over loot in a video game.
---
There are a lot more of us than you realize.
---
that's actually a pretty good comparison. i don't think i've ever run out of arrows when i needed them, but seeing them tick down in your inventory can definitely make you forget how many you actually use and go aw fuck i'm gonna run out of arrows
---
the loss of a bag slot is definitely a downside, but my first real character in classic was a hunter so i didn't notice as much, and quivers are just cool so i'll take it tbh
---
What's with the private server playerbase hate?
---
You can go on World of Warcraft's website and look at what you need. They have a section on their website that shows what minimum quality equipment you need, and what equipment they personally recommend.
---
Here is a link. [https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/76459)
---
I hadn’t even put much thought into this. I remember back in Burning Crusade seeing the main tank/GM of the top guild on the server standing in Org in full tier 6 with bulwark of Azzinoth. I was just starting Kara and was so impressed. His name was Quantity, and he was a Tauren warrior on Greymane. Never talked to him. Never ran anything with him. But I knew the name.
---
Have never recognized anyone based on reputation alone since then.
---
yikes this thing^^^^^^^^^^^^^^gender ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^neutral has a disgusting post history 
---
&gt; I am asking what will be the most "valued" class.
---
For raids, it will always be healers. Any kind of healer. After healers, it will be more healers.
---
For pvp, see my comments about raids.
---
Which is fine.
---
it's like watching a slap fight between two people who both have no arms
---
Haha good point
---
I'd estimate that 90% of the dungeons I ran in Vanilla and TBC had bear tanks.
---
It was worse than that. Hell, I got paid to make stupid replies while he typed a whole life story. 
---
Download and play right now. Test it out. Free to play under level 20.
---
Skyfang!! So cool how many memories that brings back.
---
It should be banned, but it won't be because Activision are greedy.
---
Can’t say priests are often in melee groups though, especially on horde side. 
---
That's because there is no other race option for druid on Horde. Everybody is forced to Tauren if they want to roll druid.
---
The only times it sucks is when you gotta farm mats/gold.
---
I love healing in pvp. One good healer can make the worlds difference in a battle ground match.
---
That was beautiful. Sadly a lot of people think private servers are correct on everything. They're correct on _almost_ everything, but some take them as pure gospel.
---
Dodges made me giddy.
---
This.  While I understand that private servers are not perfect, I think they're close enough that the game theory from private servers isn't going to change in any functional way to WoW Classic.  BiS lists are not suddenly invalidated, raid strats are not going to change, it's minor mechanical stuff that only affects gameplay in corner cases.  I suppose with the exception of the sit/crit thing that will force warriors into hamstring kiting or stand-and-bash leveling.
---
There's still some merit in discussion. Managing expectations is essential for clothies to not get upset &amp; for shy non-cloth healers to feel eligible for loot
---
The only game I have really put serious time into besides WoW is Overwatch. I gave Hearthstone a try but that kept my attention for about two weeks. I would love to find a good F2P MMO to play that could keep my attention until Classic launches - cause once Classic launches my life will be officially over (kinda joking, kinda not joking). I may give Guild Wars 2 a try like you said, although I may just do the campaign if that is the only free part of it. I really just need a distraction besides my college courses until Classic comes out. The wait is agonizing! Thank you so much for your advice!
---
seems kind of weird for a dps'er to roll on a healing off-spec. I'd say they can roll on it but if the healer needs it as well, they should loot trade it to the healer.
---
they literally said that in an interview

Thanks a lot! I appreciate that link. I’ll probably end up actually using it (at least for 40-60) once Classic launches. :)
---
I was going prot warrior because I always have, but my pocket healer wife decided she wanted to try dps. So I was going to play shadow priest because I enjoy it but she wants to play mage and fighting over gear if/when we get in a dungeon seemed less then ideal. Was gonna rogue but I've never managed it because stealth isn't my style. So I'm playing ret pally. I've held steady on ret for 3 weeks so it may happen

Arcanite reaper, I've always had a weird obsession with axes in this game.  Krol blade for a 1h axe but I never had the krol blade.

High threat proc and weapon speed. You want slow weps for huge ww's as fury.

Straight up it's going to my best pally. Other classes get dibs on way better weapons.

As a rogue I won't mess with a warrior unless he's like at 40% hp and below or fighting two mobs and that's the honest truth.
---
LOTR, POTC, Narnia... kingdom of heaven.. and many more movie scores I used to listen to. I gotta compile a playlist of them all before classic comes out. 
---
Spec changes should NOT be free. And they werent when they were introduced. It just meant you had two options to pick from. If you wanted to change your second spec from buildB to buildC, thats gonna cost gold.
---
Still churns me and I understand why they CAN take it but it's just a kick in the nuts is all. I plan to try and mostly run with guild/friends to avoid this bullshit and have an understanding of who benefits most from what. 
---
It's real!?!? I need to visit that place. I wish AR was more developed, so I could do some kickass LARPing over there.
---
Also, I believe on of the WoW devs on Classicast said that the premise of Un'Goro Crater was a place for the Titans to expirement with life (I believe that was how it was worded). Hence those high ledges at the edge of the map where you can stand on and gaze over the zone like a Petri dish (he didn't say this last part, but that's my interpretation).
---
Snide reply aside, I think that would be viable for gameplay, but unviable for ~politics. Yes, your idea would prevent the alleged "bunch of friends all need on everything to distribute amongst themselves" problem. But this compromise alienates both the "absolutely no loot trading" crowd &amp; those familiar/accepting of loot trading. And it will frustrate a handful of people when there are 2 ninja looters that role above them.
---
TL;DR it could work, but people are going to fight such an idea.
---
&gt;trade chat spam his ass into oblivion

that brings up another issue of right click report. :(
---
What I mean is they can't just skip a mechanic that was initially in classic without providing some proper explanation. Any mechanic; even "unimportant" things like mail delivery time should be added.   
---
Especially since they've stated that they already going as far as trying to make the very same light colors of lanterns/their placement/fog/shadows.

Loot has a grace period before being soulbound, during which you can trade the loot to anyone that could have received it when it dropped. Some like it in case of misclicks, misunderstandings, and takes away the excuse of a lying ninja looter. Some (this sub) despise it because they expect it will enable extortionists &amp; friendgroups all rolling need to multiply each of their chances at getting loot.
---
It was such a plot twist when he was indicted by Robert Mueller. I didn't see it coming.
---
Did you actually visit Ngorongoro Crater by the way? Or did you  copy the topic title from somewhere?

I think their "Did you hear something?" is expressive enough

I just wish the Pokemon games didn't start going to shit since Gen 5. Gens 6 and 7 were both absolute shit and Gen 8 is looking to be more of the same "on rails until the next cutscene" garbage. Nintendo is dead to me until they can climb out of this streak of poor Pokemon releases.

Silithus was an awesome zone once they completed it for AQ. The Arabian-like desert was somehow really soothing to be in. Especially during evening Sun.
---
you shouldn't level as ele though, its horrible.
---
Let's all be real for a second, not having a beta so there are plenty of issues at launch would be the best way to get the Vanilla experience.
---
"Dwarf master race" with obvious priest sign next to your name....I wonder why you might think that...
---
But in all seriousness, I really hope they let other races have access to fear ward, and maybe in return give dwarf access to some of the other abilities too. I know theres some problems with changing things and being "not pure" about it that some people don't like, but there are some obvious changes that the game NEEDS to make things correct...I mean come on just look any anything Paladins do ever!
---
It wasn’t. Thunderfury is a Warrior tank weapon. 
---
&gt; Pretty sure pserver players still bring much more info to the table over people who haven't played the game in 13 years.
---
Citation Needed? Because so far all PServer players have done is claim the Warlock Pet thing was wrong and get embarrassed by videos proving its right, then also claim it was impossible to charge neutral mobs without being place into combat immediately on the charge which was also proved wrong with video.
---
Its pretty bold to claim how high your value is when you are batting 0-2.
---
You auto attack things, and you re-apply your seals.

---
Not cancerous and actually gives life to the world.
---
Accurate means accurate. No wiggle room. And the lack of batching on private servers wasn't proof that it shouldn't be on classic, its proof that there's no significant amount of people who will give a shit if its in or not. That's why I said: "No one cares".
---
At least you have stopped trying to pretend I was wrong about no classic servers having batching.
---
Get close and use judgement in melee range, that makes it a melee attack right?
---
&gt; Any particular kind of healer?
---
Raids might have more specific requirements depending on guild needs but in pvp they all have value. 
---
Healers greatly increase the chances of success in group pvp because everyone wants to pew-pew.
---
Not sure which build you're referring to.  I did adjust the 2nd full resto build though because I accidentally provided an incorrect link.
---
Same with his rouge and druid guide telling people to front stab...
---
It should be noted this was for two reasons. One, unique effects. Hand of Edward the Odd has a chance to make your next spell instant cast. You didn't wield it for damage, that wasn't the point. When you have effects that are on no other item, the item is irreplaceable if a build depends on it for some reason. Even if the build isn't good, if it is fun, you'll wear that item for years. 
---
Two, itemization sucked. Starting in TBC except for sometimes trinkets, every raid you could upgrade every slot. Maybe you don't for a while, bad luck on drops, whatever. You also have craftable items, reputation gear, arena gear, etc. You will eventually upgrade everything each tier (again, except sometimes trinkets). In vanilla you could get an item and then wear that item forever. Rejuv Gem is a BWL drop. No healer who gets it is ever going to get anything else. I wore it well into TBC raiding. 
---
There is a third thing, that if you didn't know what you were doing leveling took so long in vanilla that you often would get an item that was so markedly better, usually from a quest or dungeon, then anything you would see in that slot for a long time that you'd wear it a long time. There are people who leveled slowly who literally wore the same weapon for hundreds of hours before they were even level 60. You remember that. 
---
ow, so meta!
---
There's this little thing on reddit that tells you when someone responds. You click on it and see their message and can easily respond.

Where I come from it's considered polite to respond when people want to engage in conversation.

i came from Everquest to WoW and it was funny seeing people think WoW was punishing or grindy....

Blacklisting is a meme that rarely takes effect in the real world. Do you think every party going into Scholomance knows of this infamous black list? Do you think a guild will kick a good reliable player because he 'stole' an item in a 5man with strangers? Do you think ninja looters never have friends they can continue to play with?  
---
  
---
You'd have to directly piss of an extraordinarily large number of people for it to have any real effect and even then if you're a good player or an in-demand class there's still going to be people willing to group with you and invite you to their guild.
---
You know that's not how it works right. 
---
Did you even read the blue post? It literally said they fixed those issues and they continue to work on getting as close as possible to vanilla. 
---
Where’s the realization? It’s not a finished product yet. 
---
Pagan calendar is supreme. May 1st launch date incoming.
---
In actual vanilla no one knew what it did, so it went to Rogues (and even Hunters) purely based on guild loyalty, essentially. Only after it was figured out that it was hands down the best threat weapon in the entire game did it get prioritized exclusively to Warrior Tanks specifically. That was a few weeks after the first few were completed. 
---
You're right. Based on your vast amount of strong evidence and contradicting what blizzard itself says has happened, CLEARLY, in the entire history of wow, no one has EVER accidentally given out the wrong loot... Not even in situations where the raid is rushing to the next fight to avoid respawns... nope. It's never happened. Thanks for your input. 
---
Doesn't work in the real world, people still find groups the server population isn't some hivemind and most guilds won't care of their priest that turns up for raids and does well steals an item in a 5man.
---
I’m confused why people actually want vanilla. The game was legitimate garbage lol. I dunno how many people actually ran MC to naxx but the fight mechanics are not even remotely difficult. Even the green dragons/azuregos is just slight strafing. Theres no real pvp. Grand marshall was a time grind, nothing else. The game was dope because everyone was playing and it was new. Bringing it back is like kicking a dead horse imo. 
---
Before they adjusted the spell power that wands could give, you could get a green wand that gave +20 spell power. I didn't get one of them before the change went out, but I did get one that gave +14 I think (maybe +13) and I kept that thing for a long time.
---
I'm 100% certain there is a folder on their dev servers that just contains all the old WoW versions that have gone to live. I would not be surprised if they couldn't, at a moment's notice, just drop a rollback to any version they previously released.

My WiFi was really shitty and wouldn’t posting the comment on my UI, apologies

After you get in from a full server queue, do a /who. Multiply by 2 or watch for a forum post from the opposite faction.
---
I’ve just been fucking around on pservers a bit in the last month, literally just hit 60 and got started raiding in the last week or so, it’s already impacting my friend and gf relationships negatively... be very ducking careful out there guys.
---
(GF wanted attention while I was tanking Hakkar in dungeon blues and greens, tf am I meant to do? Prioritise my real life?)
---
What a stupid extrapolation. Not at all what was being said, but sure. 
---
From my experience I would say Shaman on the Horde, just due to the sheer number guilds try to amass.
---
On Alliance, I would say druid. Paladins and priests are fairly equally sought after, but druids are (by previous standards) the rarest healers.
---
Really, though, most guilds are always recruiting most healer classes so I would say pick that has the race combo/spell animations you enjoy most. You can't really go wrong with a healer.
---
Nothing in there reads as mad. Not everyone who makes fun of idiots is mad about it, in fact almost no one is.
---
That'd be a real stupid thing to waste anger on. 
---
Heck yea we both non mad 
---
The first build you linked, there's definitely a lot of personal preference on where 5 talent points can be distrubted in Tier 1 of Enh and Tier 1 of Resto.  It depends on your playstyle. I know this seems like crazy talk, but a shaman \*can\* tank 5 man content with decent agility/stamina gear and good knowledge of mechanics.  If your guild is letting you raid as Enh shaman, then you can tank some of the dungeons and help gear up people since ...well let's be honest.  Tanks are rare.  People just have to know to be careful on aggro, and a threat meter addon is pretty much required. (Along with Rockbiter and pretty much 100% earth shock usage)
---
As for the 2nd build, I'd agree that's high end-game build there.  Lots of damage, lots of aggressive synergy; but requires high end hybrid gear to be justifable. 
---
Also, at that point I have no doubt that's more of a PvP build as well, I'd actually drop the 1 point from Elemental Warding and put it into Earth's Grasp.  The reason being is that Earth's Grasp actually has huge benefits to shaman in PvP (and a little in PvE):  Both totems it buffs are useful for breaking stealth.  Earthbind's AoE is increased which makes it great for chokepoints in Warsong Gulch, and the little know vanilla mechanic is that Stoneclaw Totem actually "pulses" it's taunt for 0 damage.  So while in PvP the taunt aspect does nothing: it's pulse of the taunt applies an AoE 0 damage hit which will break stealth.  
---
This gives you 2 earth totems that can break stealth in addition to the usual magma/fire nova totems that can break stealth as well.
---
At least reduced cost in gold. 50 gold a respec, and respecing a few times a week is nuts.
---
Literally me.
---
I’ve swapped between most classes and every role in the last week. Warrior, priest, hunter, warlock... I can’t decide. My last 3 vanilla mains have been warriors so I might want to mix it up and do something different. But I might also want to use my skills and experience to be a reliable tank in classic, because god knows they’ll be needed to lead the scrubs through the dangers of Azeroth.
---
This complaint is the equivalent of telling your wife who used to be a model but has let herself go a little bit that despite her diet and exercise the last several months you still like her hot sister who is a small-time criminal better because she reminds you more of who your wife used to be. You need to buck up and believe that this relationship is for the long haul instead of trying to take the easy way out. 
---
I was talking more in the fact that its a terrible system to have only one race on one side have such a powerful ability. From peoples descriptions of how amazingly useful the ability can be, you can only guess how desperate the horde must be to get it. And how pissed human priests must be when they find out they are the inferior race because of a thing they had no control over except to delete their character and start over...
---
True story, I logged onto the test server during a pre-patch and dueled him—we were different servers—he proceeded to spank my ass purely on the weapons dmg alone.  Mind you, this was while Tier2 legs still had placeholder models, and well before BWL.  Jubeis name wasn’t really known before this point yet as he’d just acquired Hand of Rag.

Watch the AH for flasks and message the first person you see selling a flask. Sell all the Black Lotus to the player that you want because if I'm in their position as one of the first with the recipe, I'm buying mats and making as many flasks as I can.
---
Ah.  I see.  Thanks for the explanation.  Thanks can certainly see why this is such a hot button issue.  Seems totally unnecessary and so easy to exploit. 
---
I saw someone on a private call Molten Core "Mountain Core" any everyone made fun of him until he logged off.
---
He did but didnt reach 60.  Pretty common (asmon and tips both didnt reach 60 i believe)
---
I mean i hit 60 but i was utter garbo and only did lvl 60 dungeons before quitting as a 13 yr old
---
I was talking about the last ele/ resto hybrid build.  I was just wondering the about the reasoning behind taking the 5 % mana reduction to healing spells rather than the quicker healing wave. 
---
If I were pissed off enough, unlikely it would ever reach this point but, I would post a video of the ninja-looting on the server discord and tag every guild leader. Sure, the player will still get by but they'll at least be slightly hindered.
---
i know i want to play this... i hope i can. over the past months ive been just unable to get into any games, i have such a long list to get through... :/
---
I guess what I meant was you would just use an enhance shaman in the melee group if you had one?  But yeah I think you are correct.
---
I would still need everything, but now no one get to use the item, ever.
---
If you had to choose a priest or shaman in vanilla which would you choose?  
---
My druid ended up with the eye on a solo farm run.

Now my druid has the hand of rag.

Honestly as much as I hate to say it I highly doubt they’ll hire more GM’s to handle loot issues considering they just fired so many people.
---
armor value on bosses and things like onyxia breath. so basically every boss fight was different back then.
---
Have you ever listened to his podcast? It has good nuggets and a lot of insight into the game and the making of it in interviews. Unlike the youtube retards like the dipshit tipsout that has absolutely nothing worthwhile to add.

Do we still care about this?

“The location, or "zone", "Un'goro Crater" in the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft takes it's name from the Ngorongoro Crater.”
---
If that was you then it looks like you need a little grammar lesson:
---
its = possessive pronoun
---
it’s = contraction of “it is”
---
I understand not wanting things to be taken away but, just like Pathfinder, this is arguably much healthier for the game.
---
A death spiral for games is the thought of needing to add more systems with each new generation. Gold/Silver added berries, Ruby/Sapphire added secret bases and beauty contests, etc. This system creep kept growing to where I didn't want to play the post-Ruby version stuff, so I didn't. I would prefer tweaking and perfecting UI, telling a new story etc with each new game. 
---
All three options are equally ghastly.
---
Except when you get anything other than cats, then the fish option is out of water (ba dum disss).
---
Best for tanks thanks to the insane -as proc. For a fury it's inferior to bis bwl weapons, let alone r14 or aq/naxx stuff.
---
Never seen it mentioned before but rogue pickpocketing is probably the fastest way to get gold in the first few hours after a server launches. There are neutral humanoids in the starting zones that drop like 20c and vendor trash each pickpocket. You can easily get 1g in an hour. Far more than anyone will have while just questing. 
---
Honestly you'd spend more time doing that than he'd lose in extra time spent looking for groups, you should do it either way though. I don't support people being dicks even though I think being able to be dicks is a part of MMO's. I'd rather they just made loot final and not do refunds.
---
The two builds were intended to be mid maxing in a raid.  I agree about the shaman tank.  With respecs being pretty expensive you would want a build that allows you do do more outside of the raid.  I would definitely move talents around in that regard.  
---
Yeah, I really like the earth’s grasp talent too.  Rogues never avoid that stoneclaw totem.  It’s nice in AB to completely cover both sides of the flag to pop them out of stealth.
---
what, is using a wow resource on a wow centered podcast a bad thing? 
---
Blizz has access to the actual 1.12 code, whereas pserver devs do not. 
---
That's exactly the thing that the underappreciated races should have though. I know most people don't consider it but in my opinion the most desirable races like human and undead should never be the most powerful because they are going to be overpopulated based on appearances. Vanilla WoW is actually good in that respect. You see a healthier balance of races when the less attractive races appeal to people who care about min-maxing.  
---
It's the same reason why cute girl characters and 'super cool' male characters in mobas should never be strong (looking at you Yasuo/Riven), you'll always get people playing and maining them regardless of their power, make them powerful as well? Suddenly they're in every game.
---
God why is it so true
---
Big if true
---
I'd like to add that from a purely PvE perspective, alliance WL have an advantage over horde WL due to the fact that alliance have blessing of salvation. WL have no threat drop, so salvation actually lets them put out 42% more damage on a target before pulling aggro from the tank.
---
I mean.. why would they even care? Let it be anarchy with the loot, make a rule that is visible before writing a ticket saying: "We can't restore any items for anyone".
---
If they really want loot trading then add it for the items you buy for a shop ONLY and not for items that drops from raids/dungeons.
---
That sounds really cool. Thanks for sharing! I’m definitely going to do it. I’ve never leveled a night elf either so it’s going to be fun!
---
"All content is the same, regardless of the, well, *content*, so it's hypocritical to criticise crap churned out by a know-nothing grifter who never even had a vanilla sixty and recommend you watch something better-produced by real vanilla players".
---
People complaining about loot trading are the same ppl who would always bitch to a GM that so and so stole their item, or they deleted an item by mistake. Loot is classic was fine, some items are bound, other can be traded. Just because you can use an item doesnt mean you are entitled to it, everyone in that party was contributing. If they wheret, why did u leave them in the party.
---
My hope is they take the middle ground and just not handle loot issues at all.  Looting will be final.  No need to hire GMs, no loot sharing
---
Classic will use 7.3.5 infrastructure. 7.3.5 is nearly identical to current build, which you can play for free.
---
Install, and see how performance is in SW, etc. It should be a fair representation of how classic will be.
---
How is it not how it works?
---
Yep, community figures and passionate fans still don’t want this. 
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
Did you just unironically prove the stereotype of how a human paladin would behave?
---
You can just play fury/prot with a spec like 7/31/13 or 0/31/20, or arms/prot with the classic 31/5/15.
---
You can DPS and tank effectively on the same day. I MT’d Hakkar while undergeared in 0/34/17 today. No problem. There’s a good life for both a levelling and a 60 warrior as both a DPS and tank with the same talents.
---
You want around 4-5k online. It's the perfect mix between bustling activity, yet not to busy that killing quest mobs or farming is impossible no matter where you go.
---
On the 10k server no matter where I would go no matter what time of day, everything was contested and it was extremely annoying.
---
Text posts dont even give karma lol, he literally just wants his favorite game not to be ruined by a silly dev decision.
---
Exactly, everyone did their part,so why do they get no chance at the gold. And in guild, friends group its a non issue, they have plans in place, either sell it and split gold, or gear a friend. Its randos that the issue arises, why should i care about someone im never gonna play with again. And if i do want to play with them again, im gonna let them have it anyway, since i find value in someone else getting stronger. If im in s group that i hate, im gonna take as much as i can, and risk them telling others. But likewise, if that same group is always bitchin about looters, then no one will pay them mind. Comes down to your reputation. Will stealing from these guys be bad in the long run? If yes, i wont do it, if no. Im taking it.
---
Your argument against giving ninjas a free tool to ninja WITH THEYRE FRIENDS is that ninjas already exist... This will make them much more prevalent not less.
---
The makes me rethink about rolling a Human pally. But maybe I can help change the stigma?
---
How does this help me heal better?
---
Yeye Boi 
---
Personal preference to be honest.  And because the 30/0/21 build is a popular pvp build, if I'm healing myself I'm pretty much using lesser healing wave.  Only time I'm using regular healing wave is either with a NS macro or out of combat.  
---
"At least we got the Lupine Horror" I've heard a lot in SFK.
---
If it wasn’t for the Charizard line I would have simply believed you.
---
I've found hunter to be a much tougher matchup than warlock, but that's at pre-BiS and MC level.
---
[Garthd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n2bjIsjn4M) is about as niche as [Akrios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJOPwwtznJM) - most Warrior videos were Arms, and majority of Fury videos I recall watching back then were with high top-end weapons like Gressil, Servo-Arm, or the R14 weapons. And most the other videos with the Warrior using it was an Arms Warrior breaking it out just to flex on their opponents &amp; try to get a proc before going back to 2h.
---
Another reason is that it's an ideal Tank weapon, any guild would be shooting itself in the foot to give their first bindings to anyone else. All the DPS Warriors in my guild back in the day salivated over getting the MT a Thunderfury since that would result in the guild being able to raise the DPS/Threat limit. But MC was out for such a long time that it was easy to expect to see a Thunderfury in a Rogue's hands eventually.
---
Sadly there used to be lots more videos up on WCM, but they were culled years ago. Now almost the only ones available on the internet are the super popular ones uploaded to YT and a small fraction elsewhere. It looks the coolest for a Rogue to be using it in PvP imo, so flashy and overwhelming like you're being destroyed by a flurry of wind and lightnight and steel, though I bet you'd kill something faster with a Maladath or CTS in that slot.
---
Wow, the sledge so nice, you had to get it in twice &lt;3
---
Resto and dropping windfurry totem and the warriors and rouges will love you 
---
what is the the 31 wand?
---
It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea.
---
Yeah I agree with making all loot final but I think and I could be totally wrong that it won’t stop people from submitting tickets anyway and wasting GM’s time.
---
Why would the holy priest never run out of mana?
---
And they have retail that caters to people who can't put in as much time. You can't please everyone. All the simplification to make retail easier for people who cant sink in a lot of time, makes that no fun for me who can. Trying to please everyone end up pleasing no one.
---
Outrageously ironic coming from the guy with the 2.5 hour podcast for sure.
---
I must admit, I do have to pay this.
---
Two monitors is godlike for questing.

They did not have 6+ months to work on it. They had 1.5+ years to work on classic. Ythisens said on classicast that he knew about classicwow 7 months before blizzcon2017.
---
Since they downported the legion client there are going to be bugs and glitches that they may not see, hence the need for testing. In this “news update” they said how much the love feedback, and if they love feedback they would want a beta. So by following a logical sequence, Blizzard disagrees with you. I guess you are too deluded or underestimate the amount of work it takes to redevelop an mmo on a new client. 
---
I would say that while your example plays out perfectly to show "yes you can" but I want to ask a bit of a side question then out of a different angle...what if, instead we were talking about DPS gear. Not talking about any sort of balancing between classes because I don't care about that, instead thinking about awkward situations like boomkin/ele shaman existing and likely wanting cloth gear, or melee DPS classes likely all willing to dip 1 armor type down (i.e. plate classes wearing mail) for better bonuses trying to get gear from classes that can only wear that gear (shock-shamans/hunters taking from rogues/feral-druids, ret-pally/warriors from shamans/druids). 
---
While I don't doubt they should be allowed to if its available, I'm really curious as to how much room you have to stand on the concept. I guess an actual example would be "Having both a rogue and a hunter on the team, a piece of leather drops that has the stats for both classes (no int but hunter doesnt have any int on his current gear in that slot anyways) and both characters see it as an upgrade...they are both similarly helpful to the team, (same dps, not fucking up yada yada)" would the hunter have to hesitate to roll for the gear, and is it a situation that the rogue could legitimately get angry over if they don't get the item? Would a team as a whole be able to get mad at the hunter? 
---
Healers get a pass because they are important a lot of the times, but also because they are all the same, so they have no real debate....whereas dps is rather multifaceted and requires more thought than "ooh shiny" *click*. I think the above scenario "shouldnt" be a problem, but will randomly become an issue if, say, the rogue in the situation loses or feels like the hunter roll was a ninja attempt. Its a super undefined problem since most people only ever seem to talk about how tanks always get items first and healers always use clothy gear, but the others caught in the middle seem left out of all talks.
---
[Nerf George](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apgkI-0tOB4). It was a great fury warrior weapon. Fury warriors weren't really considered a big thing early in vanilla history though and by the time that was figured out we also figured out it was the best tank weapon in the game and having a higher threat tank weapon should be a huge priority for any serious guild so it started going to the main tank. For fury warriors and rogues I'm pretty sure you get better weapons. I do not think there was a better tank weapon until TBC.
---
*Laughs in Druid*
---
I think only by dispelling the pet. They can buff it again for less mana than your Dispel though.
---
You really can’t go wrong with priests. They’re such a good choice for every situation. I think in the game in general they’re one of the most valued classes for every situation. Everyone loves fortitude. They’re surprisingly fun to level. 
---
Uhh no, itemisation in 1.12 was perfect and provided classes with the best balance imo, it would make early dungeons a lot easier granted , but it would also mean more people willing to raid
---
Just because someone doesn't have as much time to put into an MMORPG as when they were young doesn't mean classic isn't for them too.
---

their friends*
---
My argument was that you should find friends of your own and run with them instead of rely on PUGs. On top of that, you should know that ninjas would exist no matter what, new or old loot rules, so it's best to get used to that idea and work around it rather than bitch on the internet.
---
Also, as it was back in the "vanilla" era and at least on Elune (NA), we as a community didn't let ninja looters into groups after their first offense. The COMMUNITY aspect of publicly calling out those ninjas and using the forums really helped to build a list of people to /ignore and blacklist from future events. Since nobody could name change or server transfer, most people didn't behave like jackasses as the grind to getting another character up to 60 was too arduous.
---
almost like different people have different opinions? 
---
Nobody's asking them to hire more GM. Fewer GMs is good for us as it means the game can run longer since it cost less to run. What everybody is asking for is them to simply do nothing to "solve" this "non-problem."
---
Quel’Serrar. Amazing tank sword. 
---
Obsidian Edged Blade and Zin’Rokh are 2 popular 2h swords to look out for. 
---
Ironfoe is much sought-after early on, though I think it’s a little bit of a meme.
---
No, but they shouldn't expect to keep up with people who do have the time.
---
The only time you should shield before a pull is if there's a chance the tank can die on the pull. Like for a really big pack with a chance CC might fail or take some time.
---
Shield, for mana purposes, should really only be used if you need instant protection and it would be risky casting a heal or waiting for Renew ticks. That's in addition to what others have mentioned about rage starving your tank.
---
Illumination Reckoning is op and hilariously fun. Not op though
---
I hope they stay on point and DONT do progressive itemisation, it would be a big mistake to have a 1.12 iteration with any earlier version on gear ( class , spell changes..etc), all these iterations were improvements on many pieces of gear that were added early on hastily and then had more thought into them ( and allow certain specs to be more viable).
---
Add to this the fact that these itemisations while might make dungeon contest easier for some, it would make them more accessible to many, which means more people experiencing raids
---
No one is saying they should keep up.  The point was that loot trading abuse isn't solveable by 'community self policing'.
---
I get it, it just sucks playing a Druid and having clothies call you out in trade chat after your dungeon because you rolled on cloth armor you really needed.
---
want from an STV quest called Venture Company Mining. You can get the quest at 31. but the mobs to kill are level 41.
---
Think of it as a DoT that you don't have to recast on the new target.
---
I think it's used in some raids to get mid-fight low health mobs off you. Things that have more health than holy nova can deal with but less health than is worth getting a DPS to watch over you.
---
It's mostly just leveling. I completely understand when your doing 60 dungeons. Most hybrids go melee damage during the leveling process, just please don't take my cloth gear
---
To be more specific, sometimes random people got bindings, but quite frankly, the vast majority of people who were doing MC knew that it was a warrior weapon as the top tier guilds passed down the knowledge quite quickly once BWL was out.
---
I don’t recall a single person in our guild getting a binding that wasn’t a warrior.
---
Ever looked at the Activision quarterly reports? All they show is revenue and monthly active users. And we know from the past that if you're subbed to WoW or log in at all you're a MAU.
---
World pvp basically just means levelling pvp and I would say the best fighters are hunters but being able to choose a fight is really powerful for rogues/druids too.  
---
For dueling really the only decent classes are mage/warlock/ priest/rogue. Warlock or spriest is probably the best overall.  
---
For premades every class has a spec and situation where they’re good so it doesn’t really make sense to have a tier list. You want a balanced group as long as people aren’t using meme specs.
---
And the point is adding bloated looting rules ruins the game. If you cant play enough to be apart of the community, then that's the price you pay. At that pint you have more important things to do anyways, and adding rules to benefit someone who can't play much doesn't really solve anything.
---
what about gnome mage
---
Short version:
---
In Cataclysm anyone could roll Need on anything and trade it. This led to jerks rolling Need on the best loot and holding it to ransom or trading it to their buddies.
---
That was stupid and bad so they changed it so that you could only trade stuff you Greed rolled and that was fine but still caused them to have to process support tickets. This is the version I think they will implement in Classic.
---
Then they went with personal loot and eliminated loot rolling nearly altogether, so they didn't have to process any support tickets at all.
---
The possibility that they will use the Cataclysm system, which was awful, is leading to the usual fearmongering and Chicken Littling which this sub is famous for. Blizzard did just lay off a lot of support staff, I guess, and they didn't *explicitly* say what system they would use. But the howling about it had been vociferous so even if they originally intended Need-trading I doubt they missed the hint that Greed-trading is a better system.
---
I've left out some details but that's the essence of it.
---
I'm not sure, but my hairy paste is working just fine.
---
Blizzard make us proud we know you can
---
&gt;Back in the summer of 2005, WoW Vanilla had 700 realms, and 7.2 million subscribers. In other words, roughly 10k subscribers/realm.
---
That's the average, not the cap. There were still big population differences between servers even back in vanilla. the realm pop would be well over 10k for the big ones.
---
I would normally agree with you, as I've never multiboxed on an official server. But in the 8 years I've played official World of Warcraft, I've never run in to a multiboxer.
---
They are so rare, because it's quite expensive having to purchase 5x copies of WoW and subscribing for five accounts a month.
---
I need on everything, go ahead and blacklist me, thats what you do. 
---
This is what I've been wondering about. I don't bother multiboxing in BGs as it's basically wasted slots and is pretty much a guaranteed loss. I'm wondering what you mean by "World PvP"? Is the follow command basically disabled throughout the game, since in a PvP server you can pretty much PvP everywhere?
---
No
---
The rig is fine. I also have the ability to offload a few slaves to my laptop
---
I never do. I don't like losing. But why am I a dick?
---
+ 5 account purchases. Very few will actually do this
---
Run 5 copies of 1.12 for several hours, during raids and farming. You actually need a decent rig. The GPU is barely used, but you need a decent CPU with a complex CPU management system for thread optimization.
---
Those macroes were backed with an addon that did it for you. But yeah, I'm not planing on doing anything fancy.
---
People will have stuff on farm in a matter of an hour. Those guilds those are going to be well beyond the average player.
---
Didn't know this. This is great piece of information. But I had a seperate AutoIT script in the background that managed to get my Warlocks to AOE in the exact same spot. Great to know I won't need that anymore
---
Anyone who played in vanilla does. 
---
Only nu-wow players want this trash in the game 
---
Nah I just cba to argue with morons on Reddit
---
So EMA is an addon? 
---
No because I wouldn’t play a paladin anymore. Hunter or bear Druid for me. I was 13ish when vanilla was current. I was all about doing what the class was intended to do. Good try though. Huntard attitude. 
---
not completely accurate.
---
Krol blade was a sword tho?
---
Why not just use the old system though?   The occasional ninja just got blasted on world chat and it took care of itself.  I never remember opening s ticket over loot and I ne de remember anyone else doing so either.  U just need roll all BoE and greed whatever else or pass right?  Seems simple.  
---
I still wish they were releasing classic with updated textures and lighting 😩
---
Just the cosmetics. Pretty sure the cosmetics are why my brain thought it was an axe. Its been a few years 
---
As long as your computer has as much ram as your toaster you can run 8k 120fps ultra max settings on 12 monitors.
---
Only if they're the exact same role and armor type. Aka it's only undetectable for the 2 other dps, meaning you joined a group of 3 dps all sharing loot.
---
The tank or healer rolling on something they're not supposed to is self-evident, or a dps rolling on your tank/heal item. So it would have to be a dps rolling on a dps item they don't need, and if their friend needs dps items then they're most likely dps too.
---

---
Where's the rocket?
---
Self posts have given karma for years now, it was changed.
---
If they are able to confirm gameplay using the 1.12 client (and presumably server to play test) then, well it might be possible to just release that instead right assuming ties to battle.net are sorted out, no?
---
In diablo 2 scamming made me get smart and eventually it became a non issue.
---
our hands don't need to be held. 
---
its a big problem in ubrs and depending on ur class quite big in a lot of 5 mans too.  I would say this will encourage a lot of items being "Reserved" during runs and masterloot which really isn't vanilla like at all.  I don't think its the end of the world to be honest, but it is certainly not good
---
If your horde you have access to the wand from the quest in BFD gravestone scepter. 
---
Yep. Don't want to risk your loot? Go find friends to play with it's an MMORPG.
---
&gt; And it is known that they generally line up patches or other releases with the releases of other rival games.
---
Insiders have claimed this is pure coincidence, and that in a company so big, and with lead times being what they are, they can barely coordinate around their own releases.
---
Sounds to me like there will be a lot of room for meme specs, then.
---
No, the flying bullshit they pull in modern expansions is garbage.
---
"You can only loot trade master looted items" &lt;--- Every problem fixed.
---
That's what I would have thought, and argued for a long time, but apparently for as far back as Classic that's not quite true. You'd have to dig into the Blizzcon panels or something to get the details, but I believe they said it was a bit of luck that they were able to recover the 1.12 backup, and most or all earlier builds don't exist any more. Obviously the client and most player-facing data could be reconstructed, but the server-side code and data sets may be gone forever. 
---
Music was my go too also. Leveling and even endgame farming. 
---
What do you see as so great about it? 
---
Wow... an upgrade is 100% why it should be that players. Gold should not come in to play. That’s straight up greed. This ain’t pservers. You’re gonna be in for a rude awakening come classic.
---
Don't need to, I have AutoIT for that ;)
---
Plate gear can be a problem you can easily have 3 plate wearers in 1 group. And 2 of those might have an "rolling for offspec" excuse.
---
Also because much like the holy priest you'd be a masochist to level up as a protection warrior when you can lead every instance up 60 without those talents.  
---
This was such a fun item to run around with,  especially on a twink I had in the 29s
---
Yeah, and everyone else have the same opportunity to do it themselves. It just requires time and money.
---
I wouldn't(please read my post) I only group with guildies and friends, it is a non issue. And I dont care what "people" do, give me a specific instance and I can offer an opinion.
---
Tauren are terrible! In low rooms and tight spots the camera always freaks out because they are too tall. 
---
He did LMAO
---
It will launch in August.
---
People care how their heroes look in mobas? Rather have a good skill set. 
---
I love TBC balance especially how you mentioned it did it in unique ways, not just buffing dps. I also don't have any problem with seeing a return or an dps shaman or a spriest in raids.
---
Just want to address the whole warrior hybrid thing. Vanilla raids run 8 to sometimes 12 healers, split between 3 classes, with usually 1 to maybe 3 healing druids at most. You usually run 2-3 main tanks. Warriors were one of the most played classes in vanilla before they were elite raid dps for many reasons, it's one of the core RPG classes (pretty much THE core RPG class). They're the highest in demand class while leveling up and they play a central role in any iteration of group PvP - people will always roll warrior in great numbers. 3 out of 40 raid spots going to warriors is not a fair ratio. Sure, warrior dps may be a bit too OP, but imo having warriors as a top dps is more necessary than having healing classes as a top dps. 
---
You don't have to spec prot to tank dungeons.
---
The real purpose of this post is to round up the chumps for the inevitable yet unsatisfying "I told you so" post I'll make in a few months.
---
Hopefully it will offer at least the slightest treatment for the incredible Dunning Kruger syndrome of the vast majority of this sub's userbase.
---
I think it was in reference to Ocarina of Time. Which Miyamoto felt still needed another year of work when it was released. Talk about perfectionist 
---
What are   some other vanilla recipes in there?
---
That's my issue with having to be a Nelf in order to be a druid alliance side
---
It is! I visited back in 2013, and it was an awesome experience. Here's a lioness we saw just chillin' https://i.imgur.com/2NJzhz6.jpg :)
---
&gt; Does this mean it will release early/mid summer rather than late summer?
---
I think so. The phrasing certainly implies it will be available for the majority of the summer.
---
Gonna be a dwarf pally or priest to start. I actually like healing and I only play Dwarves since we are the master race
---
GMs can just ignore tickets and have that as a policy
---
What they include in their financials doesn't tell us the extent of what they know and use internally.
---
Haha me too thanks
---
I was hoping to hear something about the sharding. The lack of comment probably means we're getting it. Nice to have an update anyway, even if they basically didn't say anything new. 
---
True but my experience with meme specs, for raiding, was almost always negative. You can make meme specs work BUT they require way more work and research to catch up and most people dont know, wont bother or just plain expect to get carried when they run one. 
---
Had a ret in my old classic guild who was a straight boss but he worked his ass off to be viable and, even then, he would never make the 10 top for dps. It's a bridge too far. Single pulls yeah. Entire run never. That is with farming mats to make elixirs and pots and getting world buffs. With that said, he was a damn good player and his understanding of his toolkit was unmatched. He was definitely worth bringing. Sadly, all the other clowns in my guild who wanted to run meme specs didnt put in the same amount of time and dedication and they were getting out damaged by the tanks. So yeah, we had 1 guy make it work but went through 10 or even 20 people that wanted to run that shit and sucked
---
I meant based on the above composition. One warrior, one paladin, one hunter, one rogue.
---
How about a replacement for Loot Trading with minimal impact, which still takes the burden off the GMs: Retroactive Passing.
---
* Only works when all members of the group who were present when the item dropped are present in the party.  
---
* No rerolling takes place. The item then goes to whoever rolled second highest, (and then if they retroactively pass third highest, and so on), etc. If all Need rolls retroactively pass, Greed rolls are generated for those who greeded.  
---
* It also prevents most of the whisper issues, since it's pointless to whisper you unless they're the person who rolled directly below you.  
---
* Master Loot: If retroactively passing on an item masterlooted to you, it goes back into master looter for reassigning.
---
nothing wrong with allowing a 30 min trade window among people who were there for the drop.
---
also, correct me if i'm wrong but why do people seem to think they'll allow loot trading in any form anyway?
---
it's not in classic, they're remaking classic, why do you fearmongerers keep soapboxing about features they havent commented on.
---
also, how does loot trading save them money?  yeah activision is shit but you're just making bullshit up at this point.
---
but maybe you enjoy being "terrified" so you make up boogiemen to be scared of.
---
Im going to test this into upcoming weeks! 2 wand hits for 1 slow 2 hand hit seems like the way to go!
---
Cue [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5s0MQvF9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do5s0MQvF9s).
---
Did that's pretty cool. I'd like to imagine that you went there because you wanted to visit Un'Goro Crater IRL. Was it just a coincidence that you visited Ngorongoro, or did you know before hand that Un'Goro was based on it?
---
Retail has instant mail now? When was that changed?
---
Well I'm talking about leveling. A Feral Druid leveling up, needs Stam/Int gear badly. If you only stack STR/AGI you can only shapeshift like 3 times before going oom.
---
I see true enough.
---
This is one change I'm willing to rejoice over. 
---
That human paladin was 90% of the raids I ever experienced.
---
Time for people to complain about youtube videos they could very easily not watch.
---
Yup. lol
---
The words "Classic Summer" bring a tear to my eye, I hope this soon(not ™!) means that we'll have an alpha or beta by the end of March or beginning of April. Can't wait! 
---
I have ibuprofen, tylenol, and tums. I keep a little baggy of hygiene items just in case I need them. I also have a variety of chargers. I keep a glasses cleaning cloth and finally my flash drive.  
---
Because there's no point with it. It's an old game. They'll continue fine-tuning things after release anyway.
---
No loot trading and no GM loot support is the only sensible option.  
---
I'm glad they caught the silver mobs thing. I definitively thought they were tougher on pservers than they used to be, but it's always hard to say from memory.
---
&gt; no mana: PW:Shield -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; SW:Pain -&gt;  
---
That's a lot of crap to cast with no mana.  
---
Well we still don't know about sharding or whether the game will be able to support a large number of players in one place better than retail does now. If they don't fix that we'll have a sharded AQ opening too. 
---
Long time ago I think.
---
I'm not batting anything, I'm not playing on a vanilla server. But no, it's not 0-2. It's more like 4213-2, "something works as intended" is as much of a needed input as "something does no work as intended."
---
"This pserver doesn't work like that" is good feedback either way. It means blizzard can double check. 
---
&gt; most guilds will probably have 1 or 2 enhancements
---
doubt
---
That and what else? Off the top of my head, the biggest pserver mistakes were wanding starting off gcd, which actually has a significant impact on leveling and crit related procs. 
---
I'm just going to assume you haven't replied because the news that vanilla WoW is making an official return has sent you into convulsions and you're currently in the hospital.  
---
Maybe he literally [tips out the baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater)
---
Vanilla is wabi-sabi. It's imperfect and flawed but that's part of what makes it special. 
---
Untamed blade, Spinal reaper (raiding req)
---
Eskhanders claws looked awesome but were junk (Raiding Req)
---
Hand of edward the odd (World epic BOE) 
---
Pretty much a coincidence. A friend and I went on safari to 3 different places, and Ngorongoro happened to be one of them. After we got back, I thought about it a bit and realized the relationship. Wish I thought of it before to try and pick out some landmarks from Un'goro!
---
Hand of edward + fire shaman build was OP it was very niche not many new of it but you could easily 1 shot even naxx geared it was hillariously broken
---
&gt; is op and hilariously fun. Not op though 
---
Getting mixed messages here
---
Honestly, the amount of times I've seen this fact restating, means that I don't think it's going to sink in to a lot of people's brains until Classic actually launches.  
---
Oh well, knowledge is power, power is king.  
---
Has nothing to do with Karma and making sure a key issue stays in the public consciousness. I don't give a fuck about karma. 
---
To be internet famous, duh.  
---
&gt; requires that the group knows
---
Anything after a statement like this might as well be a wish list.  
---
Hey it's tipsout baby
---
it's absolutely insane!
---
Not even a question. For sure fair, I’ve seen warrior dps in leather gear. Whatever makes your stats better tbh
---
Unless they announce a surprise Brewfest in April, I'll refrain.
---
Additionally, everyone knows this trick. It's going to be done by a lot of folks.  
---
As everyone said, healers and warlocks. 
---
As for PvP, Hpally.
---
Maybe it was because I leveled a warrior first, but to me priest leveling felt pretty smooth and easy by comparison. I just kept stocked up on mana drinks.
---
Ornate Spyglass. You never know when you’ll need to have a good look at a bitch.
---
I don't understand what you are talking about.  Who is suggesting adding bloated looting rules?  I am of the opinion that loot should be final and loot trading (a bloated loot rule) should be removed.  Are you agreeing with me?
---
While I'm planning on going priest for that sweet sweet healer spot in dungeons, even if I decide to go my alternative as a mage, I will likely be going deep into herb/alch, so an herb bag, some empty bottles, and some filled ones for sure. If I go priest I can just stockpile double rations to mana and heal myself if I need health-if I go mage I will likely have a couple stacks from that at all times. I might even start off as skinner instead of alch and save up the herbs at first and just sell the leather at AH for however long that stays lucrative (probably abuse until level 25-30, drop for alch, and abuse the massive number of low level potions I create at that moment for more profit). Also, my last normal bag is always saved for gear that I am leveling up to (i.e. quest gear a level ahead of me, random mob drops, or if I buy from AH to prepare a replacement for a really old armor/weapon). Everything else is empty as things can get full pretty quickly when questing/farming mats.
---
Interesting. You'd think, but I guess not.
---
Not sure I have enough experience to identify a trend, but in my experience gnome mage guildies tend to be capable players but unreliable when it comes to raid attendance.  Usually quirky in guild chat but not often aggressive.  shrug
---
That is very cringe. Hate that guy. 
---
Did you just pretend my gender?
---
and asmon rightfully knows fuck all about vanilla. 
---
I'm going to play Warlock so it'll be entirely full of soul shards
---
Bandages, profession items and usually a shield and 1h. This time I'll ditch the shield and 1h since I'm not going warrior. 
---
If it ran WoD fine it should have no problem with Classic 
---
It's only 3 dps higher than the BFD wand? Why do you think it's such an important power spike? Also I don't think spell damage gear affects wands either.
---
It’s a taco?
---
It is never that bad. If you rely of fear spamming a target to kill him, you will lose. Warlocks have plenty of ways to bait will of the forsaken. I played an alliance warlock for a while and I never had any problems, unique solutions can’t solve.
---
But to a lot of people looking at it theoretically, yes it does drive them off. However when playing and finding out how to beat a will of the forsaken player, is easier done than said.
---
Unstoppable Force --- Really enjoyed using it on my Shaman. I wasn't in a raiding guild and most of my pvp was with randos. Watching the windfury procs of that thing made me happy. 
---
I heard that Loot Trading means that needing on a BOE binds it to you. That reason alone makes Loot Trading worth it because it will almost completely eliminate ninja-looting on expensive BOEs.
---
Remember that you speak only for yourself. 
---
It saves Blizzard money and so it will be in the game. Any justification they try and come up with will be damage control lies. We have to accept it and make the most of whatever weird version of classic we get. It sucks. 
---
Thing is that you aren't good at the game, only a retard would spew off gibberish like this. Fake Vanilla player detected.
---
I think the intended recipe is a taco. This is something else. 
---
But a hundred #nochanges private server superstars would claim the exact opposite before this blue post.
---
Laughable.
---
Thunder fury for rogues is good for them due to the synergy with its nature resis reduction on top of the rogues instant poisons.
---
For Wars you want to be a tank to get the most out of the weapon, as the nature resistance reduction does nothing for you.
---
Thunder fury does around 70-100 threat per target that is afflicted with the debuff, which makes it an amazing main tank weapon, and aoe tanking weapon. Fury Wars already have threat problems if they go ham to early, giving them more threat is a bad thing, and there are better weapons for them in the game anyways.
---
Just givin' you shit, lol. Glad we have members like you here that make their own content and share it with us.  
---
Playing tank on pserver, can confirm.
---
I think Blizzard much prefers smaller, hidden outrage in the comments of other posts as opposed to mass concentrated outrage. 
---
Yep
---
I’m prob rolling enh shaman, we’ll see if any random groups let me try tanking..
---
/who shows like the top 100, not the entire server 
---
It seems like a lot of the die hard, highly vocal #nochanges crowd are from the private servers player base (which makes sense since they are obviously passionate about the game). But the fact is private servers have a lot of things that aren’t accurate representations of the original game. Rogues being able to backstab while not behind the target for example. 
---
Lol wut. 
---
--Insert nervous laughter/smile here--
---
every time lol
---
they are dorfs, come on. look at em cute faces
---
Well yeah, after the world first Hunter got it and everyone knew. But it wasn't great for top guilds, there were a LOT of Rogues, Hunters, and DPS Warriors with one binding who were really upset (at the time) that it didn't make any sense for their guild to let them have the other binding if it dropped. Half a Thunderfury on a tank was much better than a completed Thunderfury on a non-tank for everything but style points. 
---
That's sounds like me lol 
---
Yea this guide has me scratching my head a lot
---
I fully agree that a memespec player needs to be good at the game and bust ass to make it work. Not many players should even consider it if they want to remain competitive. 
---
Flip it around and you'll have the true, non edgelord reality.
---
I disagree with reviews as often as I agree and apparently I am a good judge of how I will personally like a game because I’ve never been really disappointed in a preorder. I AM going to buy mortal kombat 11, so why wouldn’t I just preorder and get shao Kahn? 
---
The thing with games, and it has nothing to do with preorders, is that people overhype the whole concept of an anticipated title. You end up with fallout 76 and Anthem, which are 100% everything they were ever purported to be, yet everyone freaks out because “omg it’s not fallout 5 and destiny 3!” Even though they were never supposed to be that.
---
You're right, but unfortunately that bleh is *still* faster and more efficient than any other build, so...
---
&gt; I never remember opening s ticket over loot and I ne de remember anyone else doing so either.
---
Well, Blizzard seemed to think they got a *lot* of tickets like that so much so that it made up a big chunk of their GM hours. So despite the fact that you didn't do it, a lot of people did. Or Blizzard is lying for some reason I can't imagine.
---
&gt; It kind of worked but you had to spam it to abuse latency.
---
Can you show proof of this? 
---
Curse of tounges anhialates shamans
---
I'm leveling as prot paladin and doing 5 mans as a prot paladin. I'm not going hardcore and try to tank mc in the first progression phase but I'm sure tanking aoe stuff like suppression room in bwl.
---
It'll be fun to go 5 mans with friends and guildies and at times it will be a pain to go with randoms. I also don't mind not getting invited to a group. People with a few properly working brain cells can adjust to the pala tank style and mages / warlocks love aoeing packs to death. 
---
Pala tank for me will be 95%+ fun 
---
I mean he has the basic starting principles outlined, which should be enough for most priests.  
---
Use these talents, get these wands. There ya go. Have fun on the a class that rivals paladin for "most boring to level"  
---
I used to walk til 45 because I couldn't afford the mount!
---
If you have any interest in making money you absolutely do look at what people are doing with their subscription to figure out how to milk them more. If you have no interest in money but want to satisfy your players you absolutely do look at what people are doing with their subscription to figure out how to cater more enjoyment for them. If all you’re doing is making art and allowing others to see your own vision then by all means ignore what people think about your product.
---
sharding and loot trading confirmed staying i guess
---
Then I'm happy of being a dwarf paladin in a human body!  
---
I look like the left, I act like the right.
---
I'd prefer old radio shows (opie and anthony) and podcasts. You can listen to them and don't have to look at your other monitor.
---
I'm glad they are adding it.  I was a hardcore vanilla player and long time MMO player.  Doing things like restoring loot is what set WoW apart from other games at the time.  It's better for the community if people can handle their legitimate issues.  If that's the experience you want you can have it right now on a private server, but not being able to resolve mistake wasn't what this game was founded on, nor was it ever.
---
As a player who has leveled 6 Priests to 60 over the last 3 years, i van sat that this guide made med cringe... So mich og the he information here is half truths ør boreerline wrong..
---
Btw please dont try to Heal BFD at lvl 19 unless the rest og your grp is way overleveled for the dungeon.
---
Thanks for jogging this memory for me.
---
Go any anocdotes about being bullied in school you wanna help give me PTSD about?
---
if you play priest optimally you actually don't need to drink much, if at all.
---
And mage.
---
Yes, but how good that will be has to be seen. It will perform WAY better than private servers though and this is why.
---
Vanilla was DX 9 and old OpenGL which could only use 1. Just like Guild Wars 2 and SWTOR which is why their performance sucks on the CPU.
---
DX 11 can use more than one but Nvidia did it better than AMD. This is because the driver teams are who have to try to get it to work and Nvidia simply had more money for that. AMD's DX 11 driver HAS gotten much better in the last couple years though. Example when a R9 290 first released it was = to a GTX 770 in a lot of games despite being stupidly more powerful. These days that GPU is close to the lower end 1060, which is pretty crazy when you think that it is from 2013. The 770 on the other hand is a joke. It just was really well optimized from the driver teams back then.
---
Direct X 12, Metal, Vulkan API and any low level API (consoles use proprietary ones, though the Xbox API is probably really close to DX 12 now) gives the power to the developer. It IS harder to use though. So most initial DX 12 implementations of old games end up as a "wrapper". They usually perform around the same or slightly better on AMD and the same on Nvidia.
---
WoW HAS gotten a lot more out of DX 12 recently with the 8.1 patch on any make GPU. It's no longer just a "wrapper"

I actually saw performance skyrocket on my VEGA GPU and it appears it really improves performance a lot on Nvidia as well.
---
Now I don't know if Classic really needs DX 12 optimizations and DX 11 might be enough, but it's possible they might be able to bring the 8.1 optimizations to Classic as well. Like I said it might just not need it though. We are talking about a game with CPU overhead designed for ancient CPU's.  Blizzard's servers are probably a bigger concern. We have to see if they can get their virtualization to work better. Maybe it will without phasing. We will just have to see if Classic can handle big battles with 100's of players on screen. CPU usage should be fine.
---
Thank you! Which expansion brought in XP from nodes?
---
I can't, but around 6 months ago I planned on rolling a pally and I *really* wanted to know if reck spam worked in actual vanilla, I scoured the internet for old forums etc to give clues, I eventually found an old grainy vanilla video "guide" on how to get reckoning stacks.
---
It was a vanilla era video that showed a pally in spamming a /sit key in Blasted Lands. It had shitty overlay text explaining that there's a brief period in the spamming where the server thinks you've been crit while not sitting (or something similar), thats when you get a proc.
---
I'll try to find it when I get home.
---
That's nice I suppose. I'd rather drink much, if at all, rather than mapping out a specific wand optimization strategy. It's just priest leveling, it's no big deal.
---
bur
---
You're too good for us.  Thanks for this detailed answer.
---
Doubled edged sword though, you're expected to lead whatever group you're in. If you don't know the dungeon or any of the pulls, you'll be called out
---
I'd throw Paladins into dueling because from what I've seen...  if they get to cherry pick gear pre-fight they can really shut down almost everyone.  Great list though.
---
Before level 40 (shadowform)you always want to use renew over PWS. It heals more and costs less mana if leveled At same rate as PWS
---
I can be wrong about them being from 'nilla, but:
---
* Boiled Clams
---
* Buzzard Bites
---
* Crab Cakes
---
* Herb-baked Eggs
---
* Mulgore Spice Bread
---
* Soft Banana Bread
---
* Bean Soup
---
* Clam Chowder
---
* Dragonbreath Chili
---
* Beer-basted Boar Ribs
---
* Crunchy Spider Surprise
---
* Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops
---
* Roasted Quail
---
* Savory Deviate Delight (I know)
---
* Others?
---
Unlikely as of now due to them using a build prior to the recent DX improvements. 
---
I was jumping back and forth on the issue, but as soon as they started cutting employees that work in this particular area.  I'm really just hoping Blizzard puts their foot down and says tough luck if you assign loot improperly.  I'd rather raise the stakes on loot distribution than have loot trading.
---
Who cares what the policy is? They can change it for classic alone. It's not one of the ten commandments. 
---
I always wondered whether the translation was 1:1 reciprocally. I only have played alliance until now, so I've only seen kek. Typing kek as an ally, do the Horde see lol? Or do they see byb or what have you (some other 3 letter combo).
---
Hordies, what did Ally "lol" look like to you?
---
Simple solution: rolling Need binds item to you with no loot trading option. Rolling Greed BOE to party members.
---
The current client is heavily bottlenecked by the CPU because it is still mostly single threaded. Even high-end systems get huge frame drops in raids.
---
Nice but I wouldn't go to Tanzania if I got paid to.
---
If I wanted to see a crater in the jungle i'd go to Hawaii and see the diamond head crater near Honolulu
---
/moo is love.
---
/moo is life.
---
This right here.
---
This is correct and at the root of high level PvP for all classes.  You can just throw on a Smoking Heart of the Mountain and Mark of Tyranny and never think about trinkets again, but if you want to shine then you need to learn to manage like... all of them at their appropriate moments.  It sounds ridiculous but I see top tier players swap trinkets like a PEZ dispenser.
---
Lol i did the opposite, i liquidated all my stuff on my account turned it into wow then into tokens and then unsubbed and uninstalled and downloaded a classic private server to practice for the big launch 
---
I know man. I can just remember leveling my night elf warrior on a long weekend in March of 2005. Like I can remember the exact friends who were over playing Halo 2 while I played wow. Shit was lit haha 
---
The would be considered doing their job for all of 5 minutes until this community finds some other petty pathetic issue to complain about.
---
Never did 
---
Quite a few players in that thread literally make jokes about the idea of buying Mage portals.  To a degree I see how retail thinks that's archaic but it's eye opening to see how little they value community interaction... boiled down to other people being an inconvenience.
---
&gt; Within the instanced content, all class roles were important, CC was required, communication was required. Runs took time and if something went wrong, people worked together to figure it out and make it work rather than kicking someone - you didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes to find someone, then have them make their way to you. This promoted a lot of mentoring - when someone was struggling you figured out why and helped them, advised them on gear choices, talent choices, etc. Many times this would lead to an ongoing interaction and often friendship.
---
&gt; When was the last time someone talked in one of your retail instances, that wasn't an insult or a meme?
---
I thing this is overstated. In most of the dungeon runs i've been in in a private server, we don't really need to talk about tactics. Bosses do not have any specific spells we need to worry about (and those who do can easily be identified during fight, like a curse needing to be cleansed). The tank marks the targets so CC also does not need communication. You go in, ask for buffs and sometimes for drinking breaks if the tank isn't watching your mana bar. Apart from that, no need for chatting.
---
1 v 1 with consumables and trinkets and engineering the best player usually wins or can make it a very tough fight.
---
1 v 1 without them everyone has counters and they always will because that is how a MMO works. Respeccing cost 100 gold to change back and forth to a raid spec a week and just because people respec for every duel on private servers where it is 5 doesn't mean it will happen in Classic. A rogue pvp offspec with improved sprint can beat a mage as an example. Their main hemo spec shouldn't. So yes a good rogue can beat a mage, but most won't be specced to.
---
In WSG Holy Paladins and Warriors dominate and of course druids are the best flag carriers. Other classes can do well, it's just Paladin/Warrior synergy is pretty crazy.
---
In the larger BG's casters and Hunters are awesome.
---
Specs with the lowest skill cap (does not mean to excel on them you don't need skill)  are probably Shadow priest, SL Lock, enhance shaman, reckoning paladin, Hold Paladins (only due to the decursive mod which may not work in Classic), BM hunter. Anyone can windfury or reckoning bomb people. To anticipate blinds, cleanse them, throw offheals, cleanse CC, use freedom on warriors takes skill. Spriests and SL Locks are just so tanky that they are really hard to beat for a lot of classes. BM Hunters are very strong while leveling and as fresh 60's but that changes.
---
For hybrid/dps Druids probably have the highest initial skill cap to do well. Maybe Marks hunters and rogues next. Frost mage is pretty forgiving once you learn some basics but elemental mage specs are not (no ice barrier specs). Priests probably have the highest skill cap healing unless you are healing/damaging on a ele shaman. *Most classes need a high cap to excel.* Some classes just hit the floor running and some you actually have to be decent on to compete. 
---
Be prepared for people to get mad at the question or answers even when the very first part of my post explains why 1 v 1 is
---
&gt;It seems like every class I run on retail wow I never need to talk because half the time people are speeding through it all without a glance back.
---
Same is true in vanilla, don't kid yourself. People didn't figure out the standard MMO concepts back a decade ago, but nowadays vanilla players do not need to communicate because everything is pretty clear from the start.
---
warriors, all healers
---
I have this cook book too. The recipes are pretty damn good.
---
Hardcore vanilla maintank/guildleader etc player, and I'm completely fine with this being added.  It's certainly a lot better than the idiotic suggestion that they shouldn't add it and they should not help with loot issues either.  
---
Being more vanilla like/retail like would probably be best though in that they actually help with loot issues, but you have to page a gm and wait for the resolution.  Still, loot trading will be a net positive.  The amount of crying about this is just because there's a lot of closeted ninja's out there who can't imagine that everyone won't abuse the system because they know they would.  I won't allow my guildies to abuse the system, I wouldn't abuse the system, and I'd black list those that do. 
---
The sky is not falling and this is not mount everest; it's a molehill assuming it will occasionally be abused.  So, no, they will not be heroes for caving to the crybabies about this issue.  Find something legit to cry about like the inadequate amount of phases or lack of a word on progressive itemization. These issues actually will affect the game a lot more than the 1/200 item trade cases when someone abuses the system and isn't blacklisted as a ninja.
---
I love this trainwreck post. 
---
Shaman farming is great too because if you get mobs on you while trying to herb/mine throw down a stoneclaw totem to draw aggro then ghostwolf away until you're out of combat to mount up.
---
Male nightelf types...
---
Lack of content? No. Just no.
---
Right, so here's the issue. When that one Paladin in early Vanilla solo killed Kazzak (famously) Reckoning was changed to have a cap (it used to be infinite) and to not trigger via /sit macros, which is why that video is probably pre-1.9.
---
[Here's a blue post / guide talking about the /sit bug not working anymore:](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; “Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”
---
&gt; “**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.**”
---
I would add one detail to the human
---
"No more room for melee DPS" (Is the only melee DPS in the group)
---
After 40 I just Mind Blast -&gt; SWP -&gt; Flay -&gt; Wand -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; Wand
---
Usually keeps me good for 2-3 mobs before drinking.
---
Nope. It's just the opposite. They had source control forever, which means they have all source files going back to WoW 1.0 (and further). They, however, didn't have any other data under control, they had two sets. live and testing. After they were happy with changes in testing, they just overwrote live.
---
It was a very lucky find of a complete set of 1.12 data (in a "backup of a backup") which enabled them to even think about bringing back Vanilla. Classic will be strictly 1.12, nothing else.
---
No horde don't see lol, they see other letters 
---
I remember reading that the copy of 1.12 is functional, but not stable. It crashes a lot.
---
No I don't think so. You can solo stuff as a healer with relative ease, sure it's slower than a DPS but if you pull extra mobs you'll likely survive. You can also jump into PvP and make a huge impact on fights. Healing is my favorite role and it has been since I started, but that's just my personal opinion.
---
People think everyone will have Vanilla "figured out" this time around. The fact is it's going to be nearly as noob as it was in the 2000's, except in a sense worse, because back then people knew they were clueless.
---
Now we're going to have everything from BC babies to retail players thinking they understand Vanilla because they watched three youtube dungeon guides.
---
The amount of advantage in terms of knowledge the average pserver player will have is just monumental.
---
When did they add new flight paths btw? I recall Ungoro being a real bitch when it comes to travel, and then they vanillapatched a lot of the flightpath connections in.
---
Like, in the pants excited?
---
It isn't important at all, it's a crap wand. A lot of this guide seems pretty bad tbh
---
This is a mess
---
Wont there be an Auction House with wands on the new Classic servers? Cus I usually buy most of them there. 
---
A sad state of affairs indeed :(
---
I'M SORRY I'M DOING MY BEST
---
Bring it on, I actually can't wait for that.
---
Every time my Warrior friend used charge.  To be honest it was funny for a really long time.  Especially when he got blown up immediately after.  Lol
---
For tanking dungeon, i would say that druid &gt; warrior (i have tanked with both). 
---
I have never tried paladin so i can't tell but there is one hybrid prot holy in my raid guild, when he aoe tank adds in raid, he is just an aoe threat magnet. He is well geared tho so i guess until they get raid gear pala aren't as good.
---
I've been there!! Definitely reminded me of Ungoro.
---
 /cheer
---
"ELUNE BE PRAISED!"
---
&gt; The infrastructure is going to be the same as live
---
Wait what you mean server infra? So 40v40 wpvp crashes the server? Source please
---
What were you a) Hoping to accomplish and b) Expecting to accomplish with this post?
---
Then private servers aren't like vanilla.
---
BfA has stuff to do? Like what? WoD had garrisons, better zones, better quests, Tanaan Jungle, naval shipyard. PvP was better. There were 3 tiers of raiding. Highmaul, Blackrock Foundry and Hellfire Citadel FYI
---
As I said WoD had a lack of gear but for the first 12 months it was good.
---
Mythic + in BfA gets boring if you pug since by mythic 7 most pug groups fail because of 3 affixes. 
---
Levelling up crafting professions (except alchemy) was the grindiest and hardest ever in the game for so little reward.
---
Warfronts are tedious and people only do them for the 400 ilvl gear. Grinding dailies in the lvl 120 versions of Darkshore and Arathi Highlands is about the highlight of the game. 
---
Island Expeditions are so "meh".
---
Legion had things like the Death of Chromie which was awesome fun. Great questlines like the Suramar chain. The zones in Legion were so much more impressive than the bland, slapped together BfA zones. 
---
k
---
love a fish taco. sauce that up
---
Yeah so instead of running the dungeon about 20 times for a 10% drop chance item that only another dps would also need on, I should run it 50 times because everyone else want to either roll for their friend or to sell it just so you can get loot trading. Sorry but no.
---
The storyline of WoD semed like it was shoehorned in because of the cancellation of the Titan mmo and Blizzard had to get more life out of WoW.
---
But I dont rate Warlords of Draenor highly, its just better than Battle for Azeroth. Speaking of WoD and BfA Blizzard still hasn't added WoD dungeons to timewalking yet. 
---
My personal rating of WoW versions goes:
---
1. Classic.
---
2. TBC
---
3. Panda (unpopular putting it ahead of WotLK I know)
---
4. WotLK
---
5. Legion 
---
Then the 3 shit expansions.
---
6. WoD. Blizzard's internal problems and infighting stuffed up what could have been a good expansion.
---
7. Battle for Azeroth is above the disaster that was Crapacylsm since it at least it still has the potential to get better.
---
8. Of course Cataclyms is last for Blizzard basically doing everything wrong. Oh god it was bad. I lasted 3 months in it. 
---
tfw ironfoe drop but then you need on it as a mage, win it and ask the tank to buy it from you for 1k gold, and he will have to accept if he want it and he don't want to do 100 brd run.
---
You will be called a ninja but at least you will have your epic mount.
---
lol that's awful
---
This is woeful 
---
At least a lvl 5 computer with 1000 gammaflops of power 
---
This should be the way
---
For me that's something that I really enjoy. Most dungeons in Vanilla are simple enough that you can tell how to do the next pull, until you get to the later ones like BRD. If you don't know your way around that leading it is not pretty!
---
exept that if you click need a second window comes up " looting this item will make it soulbound".
---
Dartol's Rod of Transformation. Also a bunch of less important crap like a Hearthstone, bandages and health pots, but mostly Dartol's Rod of Transformation.
---
Yes, I did 3 years ago. An amazing safari experience. Best I ever had. 
---
Don't need to level as one to be one!
---
&gt;*Pairs well with: Kungaloosh.*
---
I don't even use cookbooks but I feel like I've missed out on owning this thing after looking at a few pages on Amazon. They've got all these nice little touches of WoW in it like concept art and lore behind the recipe.
---
Classic hasn’t been released yet so we have no idea how authentic it is as compared to private servers. 
---
You’re referring to a demo that was stated as not complete.
---
&gt; The amount of advantage in terms of knowledge the average pserver player will have is just monumental.
---
This is actually a very healthy thing to have happen though. It makes a population healthy to have people who succeed and people who fail. It's what makes up the social dynamic of vanilla.  
---
While I do not enjoy having to deal with people who lack knowledge, I understand that it's necessary. Birds of prey need to eat.  
---
Even if the entire game had double the polygon count, the original vanilla was made in 2007....back when a single 2.0 ghz core was normal, and I think way above specs---nowadays with each individual core being 2.5+ (upwards to 4) massive improvements in efficiency, even if they couldnt get it done by launch I don't think anyone would have any issues with this...
---
And then theres the fact that GPUs back in those days were absolutely useless. GPU wasn't really relevant to gaming until after Oblivion kicked everyone in the teeth (later the same year) so there wasn't any possible way the creators of WoW who wanted everyone to play this game on potatoes was going to put pressure on these paper mache GPUs. Nowadays a lot of processing can be offloaded to the GPU, so this becomes practically like a second core already anyways.
---
I vaguely remember something about them changing the translation from a simple cypher to some kind of hash around the same time as them removing 1337 speak. 
---
Im gonna make that as my next one, didnt sant to include it since i felt that it might be to Niche to use class specific ways
---
Renew -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Wand is the true oom rotation. If you can do that and live for 15 seconds to get a fear off and fresh the renew/sw:p you should people to kill must things ending the fight with more mana and hp than you started.
---
Have you met dwarf male hunters at all?
---
I prefer whining over memes. They make me feel old because I don't understand them. 
---
Let me clarify, everything in the base game is totally free - so that is campaign, PvP battle grounds / arena, and World vs World (large scale 3 way server vs server territory war PvP).
---
When I said campaign I guess I just meant that GW2 has a STELLAR immersive storyline, it feels as quality as a AAA single player game. It is honestly the only MMO where I was totally wrapped up in the story and characters.
---
What is great about GW2 (and I think amazing that they did it) is that each xpac does not add *any* new levels, and it does not add *any* new gear power, and they never will. This means that a player with the base game and player with both xpacs who has been playing for years can cap out at the same power level and do the same content. This means you can take a break for a 6 months and pick up right where you left off.
---
This is also cool because it keeps the "old" zones alive, players still go there to get loot and xp because it is still relevant to them, even though they are 2 expansions ahead of you.
---
This should be a nod to how good the content in the game is because that's the only thing people come back for (not the level up "skinner box" that most MMOs use to draw players back in.) 
---
The game is EXTREMELY casual friendly, one of the best perks IMO is that for PvP you character automatically gets set to max level, and automatically gets full access to BiS gear - meaning that if you like to PvP (like me) you don't have to grind out a new toon just to compete you can do PvE at your own pace but anytime you want to PvP you are 100% good to go. There are a lot of other things about the game that are just "gamer friendly".
---
What you are missing out by not getting the xpacs:
---
Heart of Thorns: a jungle zone, a new story campaign for said zone, and a new set of kind of "prestige xp" that grants you new non-combat abilities to help you survive the jungle, a new class, and 1 new subclass (think talent tree) for each existing class (so imagine your warrior had 3 specs before xpac, and now has 4.)
---
Path of Fire - new desert zone, new campaign, new subclass again
---
for all existing class, and mounts - mounts are all functionally different and you need their abilities to survive the desert (and they skill up with the prestige xp like the previous jungle skills).
---
Both the jungle skills and mounts are disabled in PvP - so again, with the vanilla base game the only thing you are missing are the new subclasses, which while powerful are not outright "better" and you can do fine with just the base ones.
---
I can 100% recommend the game, and since its totally free you have nothing to lose.
---
If you end up liking the game and want to get an Xpac I'd suggest the Heart of Thorns first - chronologically its the first so the story would make more sense, it comes with a new class (not just new subclasses), the new subclasses are more currently meta relevant, and I just enjoyed the storyline more as well.
---
GL HF!
---
Yeah the early private servers were... Interesting. :D
---
I play on project 99 (classic server up to Velious) occasionally. It’s amazing how fast paced and casual friendly classic wow was compared to EQ. Every class can solo to 60 without help with relative ease. You have flight paths, don’t have to regenerate mana for 2 minutes after one kill, etc. 
---
I love both games, and look forward to classic wow launching. 
---
Outside of raid: 2 sets of gear (plus wearing another), mount, hearthstone, sappers, dynamite, arrows, way too many trinkets, some basic health potions, food etc... like 25 free slots, I guess?
---
During raid: Up to 0.5-1 more sets of gear (depending on raid schedule), 4 kinds of Jujus, 2 stacks of every elixir, 2 stacks of every potion, a flask and other long duration elixirs. 0 free slots (until I drink the flask and use stuff like Blasted Lands ROIDS or zandalar elixirs).
---
That's on full 18 slot bags as well.
---
Please kill me.
---
I understand what you're saying completely. It's important for the economy, for the social aspect, for everything about Vanilla.
---
One key disappointing difference will be the Dunning Kruger syndrome running rampant, people arrogantly thinking they know what they're doing and even lashing out at those who are knowledgeable. Like what you see on this sub constantly.
---
It should be a non issue anyway. Indeed the good players do and always will find each other anyway. You're absolutely right. Thanks for helping me find peace with this.
---
Now that I think about it, my only worry is that these ignorant people will negatively affect the development of Classic WoW. I am absolutely looking forward to playing with thousands of noobs instead of being one among many very good players (ie no life nerds) on a pserver.
---
I'm inferring the state of Classic launch based on the demo and the recent dev post.
---
Which is complete nonsense because it hasn’t launched so we cannot judge the launch 
---
HoJ and HoR are better for Paladins than Warriors, so Paladins needing on them shouldn't be an issue. Prove me wrong.
---
&gt; rolling Need binds item to you with no loot trading option. Rolling Greed BOE to party members.
---
Why? This just means you can sell BoP items to other party members for gold, and it doesn't solve the hypothetical 0.0001% scenario of "someone accidentally rolled need on something or the master looter gave it to the wrong person."
---
Here is a radical idea: how about BoP items bind on pickup.
---
When I read the title I thought you meant some weird self imposed challenge to play each class one day at a time. Kinda disappointed but, I'll bite on the actual context.
---
I keep splitting myself between Mage and Priest. Priest would be sweet for early game dungeons as healer, and just feels nice to be able to heal someone that might be near death as you walk by. Mage on the other hand is decently fun to play solo and has free water, food, and portals...
---
I am really split on the idea and go back and forth all the time. Theres also a teeny tiny little voice way in the back of my head telling me to play tank warrior...despite the fact that I actually don't like tanking-I tell that voice to shut up pretty often.
---
In my point about hype. I said that hype is just hype. It doesn’t define a product and is an irrational emotion. You said advertising disagrees. However advertising uses the fact that it’s an irrational emotion to sell you products that are lower quality all the time. My example being WoW BFA. They used the hype of the faction war “returning”, sell you a lower quality product that did not at all meet the hype. This again supports my point. BFA having hype didn’t make it a good game and it was an irrational emotion based on little facts, just excitement. 
---
Now coming back to vanilla. Just because people are hype doesn’t mean it’s their biggest or best product. It means people are excited a game they haven’t seen in a decade could be playable, no matter how good or bad their memory of the experience is. For as many people say they played on a private server and love it, I can find just as many that went to a private server remembered all the inconvenient and annoying BS in vanilla and left it. However all the people who haven’t been on a private server (the vast majority) will not know how their memory serves them until they play the game. 
---
Now back to “biggest current product”. No, I don’t think classic will ever take retail in player count. They may sell more subs because of the hype but it’s going to fall off as people begin to remember. Not only that as they begin to realize playing classic in 2019 is different than classic in 2004 even if it’s a copy paste. However, If it were WotLK or late BC you would have an argument but Classic didn’t have much more subs than current retail estimations until its second half of the xpac. That’s also considering MMOs as a genre we’re much bigger back then and WoW had much less competition. Now that the genre is one of the least populated and their are a plethora of other MMOs to play, WoW doesn’t have 2 of its biggest advantages it had in the day to get players. 
---
Even if they overtook retail WoW, hearthstone being mobile and free 2 play is even bigger. Classic would have to be receiving WotLK type player bases to out do hearthstone. It’s not gonna happen. It’s not going to be there biggest product. It’s going to be a nice gesture to veteran players that would like to replay the glory days. That’s it. 
---
I just recently settled on Orc Warrior and Forsaken Priest. Because I want to have one damage dealer and one healer at 60, not have two casters, and I don't like rogue gameplay.
---
Damnit, have an upvote.
---
Can’t believe they copied part of their country from WoW.
---
Read what Acidburnings wrote one more time
---
Hahaha, thank you for making me laugh
---
I am 100% decided on the 4 classes that I will be leveling.
---
But I am 100% torn between 2 of them of which to main, and flip flop between them hour to hour.
---
I actually think we need multi core rendering more in classic then in bfa because sharding is not going to be a thing 
---
If you level the Sham and Druid as alt / main you would be able to play every role in the game - good way to keep yourself from getting bored, good way to keep yourself desirable to the guild / groups.
---
In a coop situation like that its always nice to have at least one person have healing/rez ability, so I think its a good choice. Plus, you get a free mount and she doesn't, so you can show that off in her face as everyone is going to be super cash starved at first.

Don't worry, it'll be viable by the time tbc comes around
---
Throughout the game my favourites has been paladin and priest, and I think priest is commonly thought of as the best vanilla healers. But in vanilla, I think shaman and priest have a high skillcap and the most interesting gameplay of healers.
---
The major difference I would say is the gameplay. As a shaman it is all about avoiding dmg by being offensive on casters (interrupt, purge, grounding, tremor) and kiting melee (frost shock, earthbind, ghost wolf). Whereas a priest has a better healing kit to deal with the damage, so you want to be more aware of your positioning and outheal the dmg.
---
The curse and blessing of playing a healer are the constant whispers to join various dungeon groups.
---
You can mak arguments for it "dispersing" the effect rather than reflecting, but honestly I don't even really care about the logic argument. Logic is overrated in games anyway and I love it when illogical things allow you to gain an edge over other players who didn't think to try. I think a game in which you cannot game the system is probably an overly restrictive and boring game.
---
So first of all, it shouldn't reflect AoE simply because it didn't. But second of all, it's frankly OP as hell if it does. Imagine a Frost Mage being charged at by a sprinting Rogue with Frost Reflector up. You can try to sheep, but he'll almost certainly be in melee range before it completes so you're gonna have to fakecast or some such. You can run and toss out a Fire Blast (only worthwhile instant with Frost locked out), but he'll catch up before the reflector is down and you'll tank a crapton of damage. You can blink and try to make sure the distance is enough, but putting blink on cooldown for no reason is very dangerous. Frankly, I imagine that in 90% of cases, this situation will lead to an inevitable Ice Block.
---
On the other hand, I know that you used to be able to deal with this by throwing out a well-timed Frost Nova or Cone of Cold. Similarly, a good Warlock player can cast a Howl of Terror while Shadow Reflector is up. Reflecting AoE spells just limits the options so much. Those trinkets are powerful enough without it.

Runed Bloodstained Hauberk from snake boss in ZG. My first raid epic

I doubt that your bis items will be the same as mage or lock bis. 
---
Hoj is bis for like basically everybody so
---
But ret is only fun in PvP and stoneform is better??
---
Click bait 
---
It matters if you wanna play with good players.
---
When playing with randoms, need on every upgrade. When playing with friends/guild, need for bis items, ask other players for non bis upgrades.

It's a /vg/ joke

Also gonna delete my weather app since there's no need to make predictions about the future weather.
---
I can't tell if you're actually this stupid or just a good troll. Either way, you win.
---
&gt;Ever heard of anecdotal evidence?
---
Yes. This thread is so packed with it the dictionary definition now points to a screen shot to it.
---
I've always been in to druid tanking and want to casually do that in vanilla. I'm pretty sure 5 and 10 mans are doable, even though every content generator I've seen keeps strongly suggesting warrior tanks even for leveling dungeons. 
---
I honestly haven't seen legit comparison between the tanks mechanics explaining what makes warriors the best. I know pallies don't have a taunt and run into mana problems, but afaik difference between druid vs warr is pushing crits/crushings off the table, and that's doable only with max level gear.
---
Everyone just keeps repeating warr tank best tank, and there's not so much in depth mechanics comparisons..
---
I’d use demo if there was 2 to 3 mobs or more, demo shouts threat increases per amount of mobs effected by the shout. So if there was say 4/5 enemies I’d certainly
---
Use it. Thunderclap can only hit a maximal of 4 targets and generates a small amount of threat. If you wanted to tank multiple targets say for AOE I’d use demo and thunderclap. Battle shout I would just make sure is always up. 
---
Yeah, what's really lame is when you're half way through a dungeon before their bullshit starts to crop up. It's like bro, if I knew you were like this I'd have never invited you lol.  
---
But we dealt with this in vanilla as well, so it's super authentic.  
---
This time around I am going to do a lot better job at maintaining a list of players I refuse to play with, along with reasons.  
---
The good news is that Classic will always be there. So all you really have to do is decide for now is which to play first.
---
So I would recommend to select the class on which gameplay and class idenity you see yourself enjoying the most.
---
wait wasnt this in retail vanilla? the pala who 1shot that world.boss got all those stacks by dueling a rogue and /sitting 
---
So are you now a pirate or a ninja ? :)
---
They don't want to spend money for customer support which have to answer loot tickets, my solution would be to simply not allow loot changes over tickets.
---
Isn't this how the system works anyway? At least it did on retail before personal loot.
---
Bellular did a great video on how the improvements will affect the game. What I understand is that the client will be the same so Classic and Current will be effectively on the same  client code with just different game files loaded. Therefore any improvements in multi-core use or graphic improvements will apply to both.
---
It's much easier to maintain a list of good players, otherwise you're gonna end up with a tome.
---
I joined my current particular pserver pretty late (some months ago) so I was leveling up while most people, especially the good players, were already lvl 60. 1.12 server, final patch.
---
I ran into some people while leveling which were very clearly very good and knowledgeable. 3 people in particular, two healers and a tank. I added them to my friend list and continued to level.
---
At level 60, we all ended up in the same hardcore Naxx progressed guild. They vouched for me so I got in instantly. This is why it's important to recognize merit and support other fellow players with merit.
---
I always had good luck farming essences, guardian stones, felcloth etc. I'm a glutton for punishment though and enjoyed low drop rate high reward items. Classes that can solo elites and groups (warlock or mage, hunter as well I'm sure) are best for this type of farming. I also liked making groups and farming eye of shadow off the demons in winterspring. This usually requires a 3 man team. 
---
Highmaul and Blackrock were considered the same tier by Blizz. 
---
You literally just listed 4 things BfA has that WoD didn’t.

Tanaan wasn’t out until 6.2 btw. BfA will have the naga zone by then.

Don’t try it, this is an echo chamber
---
As a cook, flintstone and wood. 
---
It's purely for my own satisfaction. I don't expect any of the ignorant average members of this sub to actually learn much from it.
---
The "I told you so" never gets old for me, so it's still well worth it.
---
That’s private server talk wow never did this 
---
In all my time playing WoW I have never seen or heard of GMs trading loot, and therefore had no idea this was something they would do, so for me not doing it would be the exact same.
---
Quirky or just straight up weird? I've deff experienced the latter. 
---
Thanks OP. I was about to whine about Classic but then I read this whiny post and now I’m inspired to not whine anymore, ever! Thank you!
---
Imagine being either of these asshats
---
Ah right, that makes more sense. Strange I didn't think of that since I used to maintain a list of elite players in Wrath and eventually created an elite 10 man achievement/heroic raid group with them since our own primary guilds couldn't complete them.  
---
I understand why blizzard wants this loot trading, it will be so much less work for their decimated GMs but there should be much better options. What about a system where the Raid leader can initiate a loot reattribution poll: if all people in the raid, including of course the person who received the loot vote yes, the loot master can reattribute the loot to someone else.
---
This could allow fixing himan mistakes without implying a human intervention.
---
If anyone disagrees, too bad.
---
Option would be available only for loots attributed by loot master, for all other cases, please refer to #nochanges!
---
Alright, so here's what I dug up now I've had a chance to get to this.

Warlock Pet - Jan 14 - [https://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-News-PC-World-of-Warcraft-WoW-Classic-Blizzard-Interview-8388913.html](https://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-News-PC-World-of-Warcraft-WoW-Classic-Blizzard-Interview-8388913.html)
---
**Interviewer:** What are the biggest challenges for you in restoring the "WoW" version 1.12? 
---
Omar Gonzalez: Many of our players have not only loving, but also very specific memories of how certain game mechanics work. A big part of our job is to reconcile the memories with the workings. It has turned out that in many cases our memory was faulty or incomplete. Therefore, it is important for us to have an original build of 1.12 internally that we can use as a reference. 
---
A concrete example of this was what happens when a sorcerer summons a demon while he has already summoned one. In the Blizzcon demo of "WoW Classic," the demon did not disappear as soon as the spell started to work. In "Battle for Azeroth" the pet is despawn at the end of the spell. Many players reported this as a mistake or at least felt it was a contradiction to the original functioning of the summon, so we checked the problem based on player feedback. While many bug reports entered by players are correct, it turned out that this is not the case here. After a thorough review of our 1.12 reference code, we found that we had correctly replicated the classic behavior and that the Demon Pet actually disappeared at the beginning of the spell.

Rogue Energy  -

November 3

https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/world-of-warcraft/22646759/restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel-recap
---
"For classes who rely on energy regeneration such as rogues, things have also changed significantly since classic. Regeneration used to occur in chunks based on the server ‘heartbeat’. So, to gain 20 energy, it would take a full two seconds. Today, the system is smoothed out so that that 1 energy regenerates every tenth of a second. This difference changed the timing of being able to use certain abilities. What seems like a minor convenience today actually changes the very flow of combat rotations and burst capabilities in classic gameplay. We felt this was important to restore to provide this authentic experience."
---
Also, from 41:00 for about a minute at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
That's just Hazzikostas saying basically the same thing as above - we know energy has changed - we're going to be delivering it in Classic as it was.  So the intent was always there to have the old system, not the way it was in the demo.  They hadn't addressed that it was 'fixed' but as I said earlier, I realise that we hadn't heard anything in relation to them being 'fixed' or 'done' yet, doesn't move the register for me much, as we knew that was their intent.  It's kind of like if they came out tomorrow and said 'remember how you could pull up LFR in the demo? Well we fixed that', then I wouldn't say that's really news, we could easily surmise it was going to happen anyway.
---
The mention of mail -  From the same link as above - and at 39:23 of the YouTube link above as well.
---
"Other conveniences such as auto-completion of names or quickly clearing a mailbox have been left in. This seemed an easy enough call given that someone could create an add-on to do the very same thing and we felt there was no point in removing those sorts of conveniences."
---
You mentioned "It’s confirmation that they’re listening to feedback and taking details seriously. Which is important for them to acknowledge.", which kind of makes it sound like you felt they were silent on whether or not they were listening to us at all.  We'd kind of heard this at Blizzcon through:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=288412/blizzcon-2018-wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-john-hight
---
BB: Some of the challenges we've had through restoring is having those places that wouldn't fit in the code, and we're working so they can fit better, and sometimes, we will find things that do not work the way they are supposed to, and we want it to work correctly. That's another thing that ***we will approach the community so that you guys will help us find those things***. It's a very large, very expansive game. There is a lot of ground to cover. So, ***if we missed something, let us know. Please help us and assume we want to know what's wrong! That's what we want! Help us find it.*** 
---
And again at 27:48 of the Classic panel link above, but I appreciate that this is just them saying it, we would like to see them doing it, so today's news is better for that, I wasn't particularly of the belief this was the first indication they were listening, but I'm basing that off of stuff that I know that others haven't seen, so I won't count that.
---
Anyway, that's as far as I'll get, it seems the conclusion is we'd heard some of it before, but certainly not all of it.
---
The crux of your argument is, I'm guessing, this paragraph:
---
"Nonetheless, we’ve fixed some fairly high-priority issues:
---
* Critical Strike rating: Each item now “Improves your chance to get a critical strike by X%.”
---
* Rogue Energy didn’t work right: it was both benefiting from melee haste and re-calculating more often than it was supposed to. Both issues were fixed.
---
* Slow Fall no longer applies to your jumps.
---
* You again get pushback when hit by ranged attacks and wands.
---
* Dodge, Parry, and Miss were all not happening often enough."
---
I mentioned earlier, (and if I worded it poorly then so be it, that's on me) that hearing these specific fixes is something that doesn't rock my boat.  If we got daily updates on what they fixed that particular day, then I wouldn't consider it 'news'.  But, I've thought about your response to that, and you're quite right, just because it doesn't move me doesn't mean it isn't news. So that's very fair to say.
---
But now, here we are.  
---
And here I am, saying, after weighing all this up, and looking over what I was able to pull up and what I wasn't:
---
You were right.
---
As someone who played human ret pally on vanilla servers for 5 years. I can confirm that I am a douche
---
Hi, /u/MyWaterDishIsEmpty
---
Ah, the child of pad264 has awoken. It is time for more... experiments.
---
Take
---
YARRRRERRRGGHH
---
The main news, to me, is that this shows that they care. 
---
They’re taking details seriously, and are responding to the community’s frustration over a lack of updates.
---
I honestly doubt they can share anything groundbreaking. But they clearly wanted to share something. Which I see as a good sign. 
---
It’s possible I’m wrong, but I’d have to assume both of us would have preferred more concrete info, or something awesome like a beta announcement. 
---
But what we got was at least something worthwhile.
---
The problem with the DM = dire maul argument is that noone ever says just DM when lfg or lfm for dire maul. It's always DM:E or DM:N etc.
---
I don't know if I'm ready for Un'Goro again... That zone gave me nightmares.
---
It was pretty bad for rogues compared to anything from MC onwards and was only fractionally better than the boe blue drop 'Sword of Zeal' or the sword from UBRS. I used to run around with it on my rogue but that was purely for attention. In TBC/WOTLK I'd offhand it in BGs and when I was boosting people in arenas, again just for show.
---
They might not have decided on what they're doing regarding sharding, as in, if servers are bigger they need to accommodate more people at launch and that's where they'd use it or not. Obviously after launch they definitely would need to disable it. The other two are obvious and should remain as they were. 
---
&gt;passionate fans
---
Funny way to spell *informed* fans.
---
Only things that I can think of would be for leveling like front-stabbing and sitting for guaranteed crits to proc talents.
---
This is an Activision Blizzard issue, not a Classic devs issue.
---
That being said, the ignorant nu-Blizzard players vastly outnumber actual Vanilla players or pserver players. Their cries will always be louder than the voices of Vanilla/pserver players.
---
Ironically things like loot trading, right click report, other "modern bnet features" which are the things that will hurt Classic the most are precisely the things that are least likely for the devs to have any power over.
---
Activision Blizzard will have its way.
---
Mana/HP/invis pots, a full stack of the best water which is my backup drank that I don't touch, another stack that I use as needed and a stack of cheaper stuff. Bandages, a backup1H and shield (shaman). On characters that don't have waterbreathing buffs I like to have some potions to mitigate that.
---
Shaman weapon. Only pally because alliance has no shamans.
---
Looks great. How would you feel about drawing a night elf in the stormrage set (tier 2)?
---
Not sure if that falls under your remit or not. Either way, keep up the good work!
---
&gt; So far it looks like the WoW Classic community will be bunch of 35yo whining babies. 
---
So just like vanilla then?
---
don't see loot trading as a issue since it only removes the need for GM in that case.. ninjaing still gonna be a thing 🤟 
---
I said it in the thread: For me the Portals being removed are a good thing, but I have a Vanilla/Classic mindset.
---
The people who play live are a very different type of gamer these days. And live is a very different type of game. I feel for that game and that audience, this was a mistake. Even if it's objectively better for the game. 
---
Which class has the highest uptime on nightfall?
---
Everyone here has said healer and they're certainly not wrong. With that said, dont play a class and spec because what others say. Play what you like to play. You'll enjoy yourself far more than trying to play a class/spec only for it's desirability.
---
With that said, beware going with meme specs in PvE. They may be fun to level, I guess, BUT to make a meme spec work in a raid environment takes a LOT of work and research to pull off well. I'm talking grinding for money or farming to buy/make consumables, getting world buffed prior to raids, knowing your entire toolkit and having the awareness for when you need to use it. Even then you will never hit top 10 dps for an entire raid run unless you have a really bad raid. Sadly, most of the people I've ever raided with that tried to run a meme spec were found wanting and eventually lost their spot. Raiding is a team activity. Most specs can hit dps check thresholds...supposedly but hybrids, in particular, must work hard to hit those. That extra effort required is what separates the few who genuinely have the desire to make it work and the majority who have no business trying
---
As for PvP, that is where spec creativity is allowed to shine for quite a few classes. Just remember respec costs can be expensive in Classic
---
You're reading this wrong. If you rolled need, it'd bind to you instantly. If you rolled greed, you could sell it to other party members... but why didn't they just roll need? So your argument makes no sense given such rules.
---
Master looting thing is resolved simply by making it tradeable under master loot conditions. 99% of the time this means it'll be a raid and if any tomfoolery happens it's up to the guild to resolve that drama and kick the people involved if need be.
---
As for accidental need rolls or PuG raids... at some point you have to accept that not every system is perfect. Is that 1% of cases worth disallowing the ability at all times? At least Blizzard thinks otherwise. Personally I, like you, enjoy the permanence of decisions or mistakes. There's a real importance to not-fucking-up.
---
That being said, I think a system with well-constructed rules, such as no loot trading on need, generally has very few flaws in it and is perfectly acceptably. I just like the idea of permanence even more. All those systems just make things convoluted and artificial. I think a game in which actual, non-trivial problems such as "I fucked up on master loot" occur just makes it all the more engaging.
---
From what I understand, you can get into raids as a Druid tank, though they make better off-tanks than main tanks. Of all the tanking classes Druids undeniably have the best AoE threat generation so you’ll actually be better for tanking trash packs/multiple adds than a Warrior of equal gear levels, and the ability to slip into cat and dps while you’re not in tank duty for bosses is quite useful (especially if you’re enough of a try hard to farm crowd pummellers)
---
What's the issue with it ? I don't get it.
---
That's separate, but I really hope they implement that too.
---
Priest is, honestly, one of the most versatile classes in the game. Shadow does solid dps though you only really need 1 in a raid. It's a great spec to farm and pvp with though. Priest also gets two different healing specs that each have their own niche. You can even be a mage lite with disc and not even have to respec and still provide bad ass heals
---
Would be nice to banish some of them, just for an hour or two.. 
---
So current, much viral.
---
Wingclip hunters.
---
It's actually easy to detect. You can inspect people's gear, it's a matter of seconds. 
---
Then you can see if a person actually needed something as an upgrade or not. 
---
&gt;Rolling Greed BOE to party members.
---
What is your interpretation of this statement?
---
Don't forget the definitive content release plan. 4 phases sounds like a joke.
---
Not only can they get a group, they're usually spammed with whispers as soon as they log on provided they aren't complete Neanderthals and can hold threat half decent and call out CC
---
And you'll be called out on the server forums, get blacklisted and won't find groups anymore. 
---
Mass of McGowan and other similar simple blocks of metal speak to me. 
---
Can anyone recommend me some cool polearms? Always had a fascination with them since they were so rarely used, and polearms were cool weapons IRL.
---
Yet you frequent this sub and post a whiny post of your own.
---
A couple of questions:
---
1. Does spell damage really affect wand damage?
---
2. Why only 2/3 Imp. Shadow Word: Pain?
---
Great now im conflicted between paladin and priest
---
technically this is all anecdotal evidence. A single exception is not an argument against a norm though.
---
Dark edge of insanity is fucking cool.
---
I roll human pally just because dwarves look silly on horses
---
Mainly because it's a 2 point talent.
---
It would be pretty immersion breaking if you had to glitch the game to get there. So a lot worse than how it actually was, I would say.
---
Many vanilla bosses have fear mechanics. Wotf  can be useful in pve.
---
Need: Soulbound.
---
Greed: Can be traded to party members.
---
Therefore, unless everyone rolled greed, you cannot sell items to party members. So I'd rather ask you, what is **your** interpretation?
---
In vanilla bear tanks were not very good until they fixed their armor though right?  Or did you just start later on when it was fixed?  I personally just always had warriors tanking in vanilla I think with the rare exception where we had double hunter pets tanking a low lvl dungeon run ...  That being said I only did 5 mans fairly early on in vanilla's lifespan so it may have just been biased that way.  TBC though definitely remember bears + pallys tanking a lot.
---
I suppose it’s easier to spot King Mosh before he aggros you due to the higher view distance.
---
Someone really needs to explain to me why so many people can't assign loot without the assistance of a GM. 
---
So why are BoP items suddenly able to be traded to party members provided they all roll greed? What problem does this fix?
---
Does this really happen that much?  I have played a healer quite a bit and I very rarely got whispered that I can remember unless I already knew the person.  I cant remember is there an anonymous function in WoW vanilla?  If so I probably just hid myself.
---
Well it's a corrupted place for sure. But the experience is something unique 
---
There's 25mages queueing up for every raid. This isn't the case.
---
It's a two way street, yeah? Let's hope he doesn't spot you first
---
Biggest reason to roll Shaman.
---
Some servers had dedicated in-game custom chat channels. Just a big ass channel dedicated to LFG. But ours was plagued with nonsense the majority of the time.
---
Discord channels I think are inevitable. It's a more consistent way to stay in touch wherever you may be. But I think it'll be used in conjunction with in-game.
---
Not everyone in-game wants to join the realm discord. For good reasons. LFG and "trade" chat are still going to be the primary means for it.
---
Ultimately I'm fine with Discord, it's part of the gaming world today, and I may even use it. But I'd be against anything compared to retail LFG in Classic. That's just part of the experience. 
---
Yeah, bit after they buffed bear form, pre-60 druids were usually better tanks
---
Plenty of times that someone brainfarts and rolls greed before realising an item is an upgrade or useful to an off-spec. To be fair though the main reason I'd argue for loot trading is because of master looter mistakes. Having been a master looter for the entirety of WotLK, mistakes do happen in this area. The interface is so cluttered with names that it's an inevitability. On top of that, players also make mistakes. I've had plenty of times where someone backtracked on wanting/not wanting an item after the item had already been assigned.
---
Soon will be info and a "beta" two weeks from now/from this monday.
---
Loot trading will be removed and sharding only on first week on starting zones, **never** again to be seen in Classic **especially not on AQ event**
---
pls
---
Multiboxing gives you an unfair advantage. 
---
Very good point on a lot being offloaded to the GPU now.
---
Loot trading was never meant to address ninjaing and thinking so shows a complete ignorance and misunderstanding of the matter.
---
Loot trading is only meant to address accidentally pressing "need" instead of "greed," or Master Looters sending the loot to the wrong person on accident.
---
And of course, if Activision Blizzard isn't willing to support the game with GMs, the only sensible decisions is a "zero tolerance" policy to looting mistakes and not interfering.
---
Loot trading introduces far more problems than the potential of fixing an extremely niche issue that will only ever affect &lt;0.1% of the population (accidentally ML'd the loot to the wrong person or accidentally pressed need and willing to trade instead of actual ninja.)
---
Activision Blizzard may not know how to make games anymore but they still know how to do PR.
---
I think you’re missing a few ingredients.
---
Imagine thinking like this
---
When it comes to world buffs if you're doing ony every week there's no reason not to pop the head just before your next raid. Same with ZG though most guilds save hakkar heart for the next big raid. More hardcore guilds will get trib buffs too though those are usually best after your guild knows how to clear a raid with them or for progression on a stupidly hard first boss, so you might find guilds that want raiders to have trib buffs for BWL or AQ40 for example. Outside of that, having trib buffs is mainly a fun way to bump yourself high up the damage meters!
---
Only if you are in the same guild
---
I'm like you except my unfinished business is going past Huhuran.
---
I've also always wanted to heal, and played hunter in vanilla.
---
I also hate benediction which you're forced to take.
---
Yeah I agree.
---
Though tbh I like the idea of instanous spawns and low visibility that private servers used to make launches smooth a lot better. There's just something about it ;) (Also the spawns depend on players in a circle around you or something so it is a lot harder to abuse than sharding). 
---
can they actually do anything about the spell batching issue? what kind of work would that take. im guessing not a lot of people can answer this clearly
---
It's not just human memory, it's biological memory as a whole. Can't wait when we are able to install SSDs into our brain.
---
&gt; Having been a master looter for the entirety of WotLK, mistakes do happen in this area.
---
How many times has this actually happened to you? In years of playing retail Vanilla and almost a year of playing pservers, I've only seen a genuine ML mistake *once.*
---
It seems extremely misguided to implement a system to address a 0.1% scenario that will potentially negatively impact every single dungeon run.
---
But then again, there are only two reasons this feature is being, and is definitely going to be, implemented and that is that
---
1) Activision Blizzard doesn't want to provide the game with GM support and
---
2) the feature is already coded so doesn't require any work.
---
Ony attunement necklace always.
---
you dont get to keep anything that you get/achieved in beta. that would be unfair to others that weren't in the beta

Why is this community so cancerous. I guess blizzard should just refrain from updating since they are sure to get shit flung in their faces no matter what they write in the update post.
---
4 phases btw
---
Dwarf priest.
---
Private servers are flawed. I don't think when we play classic we'll see mobs run away with low health, collide with a tree then just stand on the spot while you kill them.
---
I've always mained a human paladin and consider myself closer to the dwarf example but I get the idea :)
---
They can as long as the group understands you have no taunt. That's a pretty huge condition.
---
There's enough on YouTube these days that explains the threat generation of all classes with tanking abilities.
---
Also youtubers like tipsout do suggest that pallies and druids are pretty viable tanks for leveling dungeons. 
---
Pathing isn't great on private servers. I don't think when we play classic we'll see mobs run away with low health, collide with a tree then just stand on the spot while you kill them. 
---
and it will be even more prevalent if that stays in. it will just be more discreet. say two friends are in a dungeon together, both casters or both melee. one needs a pre raid bis item, the other has. your friend will have unequipped that item before the dungeon so it looks like he needs it to. and now he's needing it just to give to his friend after the dungeon.
---
Why would anyone other than the dev team know if it is possible, or how much work to accomplish it? Independent of it’s difficulty of implementation I want them to emulate the behavior.
---
YEAH LETS HAVE SHARDING SND FLYING MOUNTS AND LFR SINGLE PLAYER WOW BEST WOW OMEGALUL
---
prick
---
Spiritually excited
---
I love the inherit pessimism in this one lol. We're all broken creatures, I hear you brother.
---
Holy shit how did you get that from that.
---
You must have severe problems living independently.
---
Climate change Denier? What no. How childish are you to assume my opinions.....why would you delete your weather app?
---
You’re making assumptions based on no evidence. Please attempt to engage your brain before speaking.
---
Yep this community is just worst. Constantly bitching, toxic and shitting on other WoW versions. I wouldn't suprise if it drives people away from Classic.
---
&gt;How many times has this actually happened to you? In years of playing retail Vanilla and almost a year of playing pservers, I've only seen a genuine ML mistake once.
---
Including the times that people backtracked on wanting/not wanting items, I wager about 5-6 times. I think 2 fuckups were on my end, the others were on other people's end.
---
&gt;It seems extremely misguided to implement a system to address a 0.1% scenario that will potentially negatively impact every single dungeon run.
---
How? How does it negatively impact "every single dungeon run" if it only works on greed rolls? Your argument seems to be entirely revolving around this:
---
&gt;This just creates the dynamic of selling BoP items to people (provided everyone rolled greed) which just creates a foreign, unhealthy, useless dynamic
---
What the hell is this selling of items if everyone rolled greed? That means, first of all, that someone accidentally rolled greed or had a brainfart. This alone already excludes it from the definition of "every single dungeon run". And moreover, dear god the level of dick that someone must be to demand compensation for a greed-won item. What the hell are they even going to demand, the vendor price?
---
And even if, if this happens, SO WHAT? Previously GM's could trade items, but would only do so under mutual agreement. If that player refused to allow the GM to take that item away from him, it'd be the exact same situation. Heck, if anything the system still makes it easier/possible, as the guy can at least pay this obvious dickweed to get the item he desired.
---
But seriously, selling greed-won items? What the fuck is this.
---
As a matter a fact, a properly geared hunter with the appropriate buffs and guild can tank a few raid bosses. However, the recurring problem is the lack of threat.
---
Because all those things you mentioned are non issues, they mentioned actual issues they are fixing.
---
we reserved items all the time in actual vanilla...so not vanilla like at all...totally vanilla like?
---
We also definitely masterlooted UBRS during vanilla.  I guess different servers had different experiences, but in my experience these things were not uncommon.
---
It certainly happened to me in Vanilla. I played a Druid.
---
I don't think there was an anonymous function.
---
Claw of the Black Drake looked awesome in my eyes, it's a shame I'll never be able to get it again.
---
Does anyone remember a decent rare sword being given as a quest reward in Eastern Plaguelands? I remember being told to get it by the rogue class leader when I joined my first raiding guild but can't find out what it was.
---
I knew people would find some way to complain about the blue post.
---
Plenty of misinformation in this thread. Thunderfury in it's original state used to be the absolute BIS mainhand for rogues when it comes to raid dps, due to the original pre-nerfed 30% rate for the 300dmg proc, that also had the similar chance for going off again from itself (doubleprocs), any skill hits, swordspec hits, other damage such as poisons or the darkmoon faire trinket. In the patch 1.9 the procrate was nerfed from ~30% to ~15%, and the procs from anything else than autoattacks and attack special abilities were removed, making it a pure tank weapon. In the patch 1.12 it was changed from mainhand to one-hand, which again made it extremely good for rogues as an offhander even with the heavily nerfed proc.
---
I want them to emulate it too I was just wondering if anyone was familiar with it. There are people that could have an idea outside of the Blizz dev team 
---
Good on you man. Feeling healthy is the best thing in the world.
---
Thanks ! but from what you are saying some boss are too hard/impossible without world buff ? 
---
Or not worth too much try when you can kill them with world buff ?
---
I've seen Nihilum world first kill they had ZG buff too, this look like a really powerfull world buff, would they have been able to kill KT without it ?
---
That is true. However, as someone who exclusively tanked as Warrior, both in Vanilla and private servers, a Prot Warrior is far superior to a Fury or Arms one, especially in 5 men dungeons.
---
A Prot Warrior in a 5  men dungeons, ensure a FASTER run (far less mana breaks) and a SAFER run (because, duh, he is a damn Prot Warrior).
---
Any healer or Warrior tank will tell you that.
---
Yes, you don't HAVE to spec prot to tank dungeons...but damn, if you do, people will LOVE you.
---
Why do I get the feeling 90% of the people who reported bugs never played actual Vanilla and were just comparing the demo to private servers like Nost? 
---
&gt; currently playing on vanilla and as a tank finding it somewhat annoying that i basically have to sit in town to find/create pick up groups.
---
And why is that a problem? Do you NEED to be 100% efficient with every single minute you spend online? If that's your goal then WoW Classic is never going to be a game you'd enjoy. Classic isn't about efficiency it's about connections. 
---
Sitting in town (or relevant world zones), searching for people and TALK TO / CHAT WITH them. Adding them to your friends list for the next days. Inviting them again, prior to having the need to sit in town and search for new groups. THATS THE CLASSIC WAY.
---
Quite frankly, if you're playing with different people every single day then you're most likely "doing it wrong"... In my eyes, you'd then be part of the problem ;)
---
To properly jump in to your question though, external tools are certainly going to be a thing. Specifically for raids. But that's something that existed back in Vanilla WoW as well. And it's far from the majority. For things like normal Dungeons I doubt it though. Assuming we are going to have actual server communities a Dungeon Finder simply won't be necessary as you'll make actual human connections again and you'll have a ton of people to play with.
---
Fogged their memory? Most of them never even touched Vanilla and ONLY played Private Servers, which is why they think the demo is wrong. 
---
Just like IRL, you don't have to be the most knowledgeable or clever, just the most outward, representable and consistent. Which is precisely what Tips is! He does get things wrong, but his videos are high quality and the charisma to narrate. Loved his new UBRS key video since I didn't have a clue how to get it, and now I do...in 5 minutes. I could have read some guides and old articles, but that was way faster and more enjoyable.
---
Damn I'm happy for this update. I just can't enjoy any game because all I want is Classic. It can't some soon enough.
---
How did you manage to bypass the mafia?
---
I drove a safari vehicle equivalent to an epic mount
---
There is a quest where you go and speak to some old titan constructs on the cliffs of Un'Goro - follows the theme of the discs of norgannon from the end of Uldaman. 
---
May have been added in a later expac though because I seem to remember it being linked to Sholazar Basin in Northrend - that zone was also a 'petri dish' for titan experiments. 
---
Yes but these are things you can get used to quickly I‘d guess. 
---
It really depends on what people are after out of the experience. I don't know much about private servers but it seems a lot of people are doing speed runs and the like, so when that's the challenge then world buffs makes sense.
---
One of the problems there is with Classic in terms of competitive progression is that a lot of the fights just aren't going to be as hard as people remember them. I say this as someone who did every fight in vanilla and TBC with only Twin Emperors, O'uro, C'Thun, M'uru, and Kil'Jaeden as something other than progression raiding (guild breakup on Twin Emps and rerolling factions, guild breakup on M'uru and joining a guild who got further to see the encounters and then quitting the game).
---
A lot of vanilla fights were hard due to lack of knowledge. 4 Horsemen (one of my favorite fights ever) was in big part hard because people didn't know how it worked. The Death and Taxes screenshot with all the skeletons in the safe zone basically opened the fight up for a ton of guilds that hadn't found the safe zone yet. Now we're just going to enter with that as knowledge. A lot of DPS checks and such are just going to be easier because we know what the best gear and spec is. That wasn't all common knowledge in vanilla. MC was actual difficult progression when it was first out because of how few guilds understood how to raid and how to manage 40 people. When I was raiding AQ and Naxx you could still have trouble recruiting someone good enough to do them because still the majority of people hadn't done anything like that. Honestly, you even had stuff like people not having good enough computers to do some of the stuff, people dying to invisible void zones on 4H or being behind a block on their screen on Sapphiron but still dying.
---
We'll see if I'm wrong, but I think most of the "difficulty" of vanilla raiding is going to be pretty irrelevant anyway because of how well known it is. If the release of dungeons isn't staggered so quickly that people just haven't had enough resets to gear up, the race for world first etc is just going to be luck and raid times.
---
Hi, /u/mattz2023
---
They mostly deal in horns and tusks.  
---
Sounds like a vicious cycle.
---
Just buy yourself a really good game, for RPGs I need like 2 months and you have a lot of options tbh.
---
Best comment in the thread hahah
---
But.. what if you aren't paying attention when you hand out guild drops?
---
/join LookingForGroup
---
oh my god I forgot to reply to your message, I started drawing it I swear!
---
people werent efficient becuase they didnt have the means to be, nowadays it is a lot different, i would much rather be doing something like mining fishing or grinding mobs i need for cooking than sitting in town, and it seems like the vast majority of players play more "solo" than i remember and only do dungeons once and only when they have all the quests.
---
and if people use tools like discord to find pugs, is it really the classic way? sure teamspeak existed but the closest thing i can think for the chat channels and things we have in discord now was IRC at the time which i dont think was very popular for WoW.
---
also finding people to help with obscure elite quests is definitely a lot harder, maybe itll be different when classic launches but people are a lot less helpful or wont help at all if they dont have the quest.
---
while i agree its the easiest way i think itll be overlooked by the majority of the playerbase
---
I dunno, I tried both and I liked fury a lot more for some reason.
---
I remember killing them wolves in duskwood like nothing, thanks to blood craze and earlier Cruelty.
---
Cruelty feels like such a beast of a talent, sometimes I prefer getting it at lvl 10-14, then respeccing to mortal strike.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Rend....lol
---
CAN I HAVE YOUR GOLD?
---
Top comment here.
---
Loot trading means I can roll on all the gear my friend needs in dungeons and give it to him, right?  
---
Sharding means when people say "Hey come check out the 50 naked Night Elves dancing in Goldshire!" you run all the way there, and poof no one is there because it's sharded, right?  
---
In my personal opinion.. people who downplay these problems are not real Vanilla WoW lovers, or they are straight up stupid. Looking at you entire community downvoting this comment.
---
Non issues? I bet you have no idea what these things even are.
---
Shamans in dungeon sets maybe lmao 
---
I know what all of them are and they are as I stated, non issues.
---
If they were issues they would have been mentioned.
---
its not, arms is the better spec, fury was better on private server because of abusing the sit/crit bug.
---
Most people recommend Fury -&gt; 40 and then Arms -&gt; 60.
---
You might be right that it's a lot closer if you can't trigger enrage with sit. One downside of arms is that it forces a single weapon type which might make it harder to secure upgrades as you level.
---
I really wish they'd deactivate world buffs in the latest released progression raid.  
---
Said every retail player on the subreddit...
---
&gt; Rend's head
---
Did this work in vanilla? Because that sounds awfully like a private server thing.
---
It is a joke. What do you think the Nostalrius devs said when they heard Blizz wanted to package everything in that retarded way?
---
fury talent but 2h weapon until Ms
---
Ugh I almost forgot about this. Thank god for Blizz-like private servers who actually manage not to fuck up those most simple things.
---
Haven’t been a retail player since WOD. 
---
All I hear is "QQ I got ganked in TM."
---
I wonder if its worth it then to go into fury for 5 points to get get 5/5 cruelty ... since that seems to be the big seller on fury.(aside from enrage)
---
You just proved me correct beyond my expectations. If you made it past Cata, you dont deserve to make such blatantly wrong statements that ANY seasoned Vanilla veteran would tell you to eat shit and die over.
---
There are no seasoned vanilla players. Just private server players which equates to basically nothing.
---
Psh walking til 40 bqck in my day i had aslect if the cheetah on my main and travel form on my alt - no need for any mount until my guild got sick of summining me to instances in tbc
---
VERY OFTEN.
---
Now stop talking like a James Bond villain and go play your pretend server 
---
not until after MS, in fact the true underdog talent for arms tier 1 is parry, reducing heroic strike rage is pretty poop compared to 10% parry while leveling
---
I played on a 1280x1024 Display with 800x600 at 24 fps.
---
And anything bigger than 30 fps was "good enough"
---
With low settings.
---
I was always desiring something better.
---
Worse, it was one of those shitty display that hurt your eyes more than the new ones.
---
Then a little later I got to play at real 1280x1024 (same shitty display) with med-high settings at 40 fps.
---
And that was awesome.
---
Also internet was shit back then, I had 40 ms and that was "excellent" sometimes it got over 100ms.
---
Now I have much better internet, 4ms, they have way better servers, 60 fps a bigger screen.
---
Loading times are even much better.
---
It should be optional to each player, because back then I ALWAYS wanted something better. The graphics don't give me nostalgia, the music does. 
---
If they are going to force everyone to have the old graphics they should force everyone to play at 30 fps too on a nonwide resolution.
---
No I'm talking raiding population on EU retail. 4 US World firsts since the game launched, EU has 15 plus. Majority of top 100 guilds have always been EU. I don't care what the overall pop of US dad gamers is. 
---
Paladins could just stay alive foreve and make the other team die of all the bubbles shining so brightly.
---
this is not about refrain from updating. stop trying to steer away the discussion.
---
**THIS IS ABOUT NOT TACKLING THE HOT TOPICS**.
---
MINSK!!
---
Best part of fury is piercing howl imo. It lets you escape when you pull too many mobs. The other fury talents are still good too even without /sit
---
I think a lot of people confuse Vanilla with TBC summoning
---
I resubbed over Christmas. Played for about 3 hours then came off. Felt so empty. :(
---
Rend is the most efficient way to spend your rage, what do you spend it on?
---
Nah, beyond the realms of their technology that.
---
I see. Do you happen to know if the /sit thing is actually OFFICIAL ? or just a rumor ?
---
It depends entirely on how their system is designed. I mean, for all we know they removed the spell batching system ages ago by simply making the batch 0ms in size, so restoring it is just setting it back to 400ms.
---
They could also have removed it by replacing every call to the batching system to an immediate call, in which case they'd now have to revert all calls again (which, depending on design, could range from a handful of calls to thousands), as well as recreate the system (as even if they import the old code, it is unlikely to work in their new structure).
---
Unfortunately there's just no way of accurately predicting how long a change to the system takes without intricate knowledge of said system. There's just too many ways to code a system that looks identical to any outsider, but is completely different in terms of difficulty to adjust.
---
Ya know what's funny, back then we all thought Wrath Babies were the biggest whiners, most entitled and babied players out there. I look at current retail players and those Wrath Babies seem like fucking bodybuilders in comparison. It went Wrath Babies -&gt; Cata Babies -&gt; Everyone who still plays is a fucking baby.
---
This.
---
I did the same last year cata was fun to quest through but overall a disappointment.
---
Anything since has not interested me.
---
Probably wouldn't be very hard to emulate. Spell batching was a performance enhancing technique, designed to let the server broadcast and receive a bunch of spells at the same time, instead of having to deal and broadcast each spell separately. Emulating should be as easy as storing spells in intervals, and then accepting each spell in the interval as having occurred simultaneously. That would be an emulation however, and isn't guaranteed to work exactly the same way as it used to.
---
afaik the sit/crit thing was/is a server client bug caused by desyncing, which was not in the classic demo, fury pulls ahead when just soloing content and grinding mobs/quests
---
currently leveling this, [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LqGxdAbo0zVZVVbc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LqGxdAbo0zVZVVbc)
---
the last 3 talents can go wherever you need them but this basically lets you do anything in the game and do it pretty well, you can solo content, pvp and tank instances without having to respec constantly
---
&gt;Loot trading means I can roll on all the gear my friend needs in dungeons and give it to him, right?  
---
We don't know.
---
&gt;Sharding means when people say "Hey come check out the 50 naked Night Elves dancing in Goldshire!" you run all the way there, and poof no one is there because it's sharded, right?  
---
Yes.
---
&gt;In my personal opinion.. people who downplay these things as a non-issue are not real Vanilla WoW lovers, or they are straight up stupid. Looking at you entire community downvoting this comment.
---
Well, we don't know about loot trading. It sounds horrible though.
---
About sharding. They've said they might use sharding at launch in a limited time frame and limit it to starter zones. Sharding isn't an issue if implemented as they said it might be.
---
I'm not gonna lie but chances are you're somewhat ruining the fun by re-remembering content through someone else instead of experiencing it on your own. I HOPE I forget as much as I can about classic so that I can get even a fragment of the wonder that I had when I was 13.
---
Community: WE NEED AN UPDATE, IM SLOWLY LOSING MY MIND!!  
---
Blizzard: Here is a small update with some information about Classic! See you soon!   
---
Community: REEEEEE NOT THE UPDATE I WANTED GIVE ME WHAT I WANTED
---
&gt;Yes, thats works and thats official buff.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Once someone turn-in "For The Horde!" quest(and there is no Rend's head on the pike near Thrall) there will be applied Warchief's Blessing buff for all Friendly+ to Orgrimmar players in Orgrimmar/RazorHill/Xroads.
---
Does the warrior and more specifically the prot warrior have any aoe?
---
No. Just no. 10 paladins in a BG? That is pure evil at work.
---
foot on the pedal
---
It would still take away development time, which we can probably both agree on could be used on more important things
---
I think the first op means overpowered and the second op means original poster 
---
How do you know they don‘t? I think the optional classic setting like what they had at the demo is totally reasonable. After all, having the modern graphics is the easy thing to do, but making it ‚old‘ again is where work needs to be done.
---
4-5k online? When 80% of those will be lvl 50+, and when there are only a handful of zones for questing / grinding / farming at those leveles...you look at 600+ players per ZONE.
---
That is a NIGHTMARE.
---
Even if you spread them on 10 zones, 300+ people per ZONE is way too much.
---
2.5k concurrent cap. It is MORE THAN ENOUGH.
---
Ok now I have more of an idea, thanks for dropping this knowledge bomb! 
---
No.
---
&gt;Nice but I wouldn't go to Tanzania if I got paid to.
---
And why is that? I've been and it is a wonderful country.
---
Here's to hoping they are working on a solution
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
say two friends are in a dungeon together, both casters or both melee. one needs a pre raid bis item, the other has it already. your friend will have unequipped that item before the dungeon acting like he needs it to. and now he's needing it just to give to his friend after the dungeon. so getting your friends to roll on something they don't need to help you is a non issue?
---
Download vQueue addon. It scans the chat so you can be the only guy on the server with the addon and it's still useful to you.
---
Not everyone likes stance dancing. I know it's a core part of the warrior but I just loathe it for example lol.
---
personally I dislike this thread. but when people argue they are "non-issues" that's another thing
---
I find it boring to scroll through excel documents when you’re checking for bis-gear. So I started sketching on a website that gives you a better overview of all the pieces of gear for the different tiers. I appreciate any feedback and if you have any ideas for features etc you’re more than welcome to let me know! Keep in mind that this is a quick prototype :).
---
it is absolutely clear that there are far more issues that have been highlighted and heavily debated here and on classic forums that they choose to ignore. in fact all of the game-breaking,  non-vanilla items like spell batching,  sharding, server cap, will there be a beta...
---
they are providing worthless factual info on speci-whateverthefuck minor bug they are addressing.
---
you can write novels and not say one damn thing.
---
If you want to have a single player start, BfA fits your needs, but we want to have an authentic experience.
---
 Laggy unquestable starting zones with too many people is a part of that experience.
---
If the dps is on point, Warrior tanking is still the best. Once you assume a scenario that benefits a non-Warrior tank...the Warrior tank also benefits from it.
---
I am not saying it is not possible to tank as a Paladin.
---
I am just saying that the vast majority of people won't want a Paladin to tank, because, well...it's a Paladin.
---
You are assuming only a slower run...but you fail to say HOW MUCH SLOWER. 
---
I think that most people will wait 1 hour for a Warrior or Druid.
---
Some groups might be really desperate...oh well, they will try a Paladin, ONCE.
---
After that, they will wait 1-2 hours for a proper tank.
---
Cant blame you. Fuck other people. You are all basically NPCs in my MMO.
---
Pfsh, please, they just have to throw a bone to the horde playing normies.
---
Hunter / Warlock pet tank &gt;&gt; Paladin tank.
---
Can I get an IPhone app? 
---
So sad to have been playing the game for so long and to still be so clueless about it.
---
Exactly. I stopped leveling other characters and exclusively played dwarf pally because I hated Rogues more than I enjoyed playing other classes.
---
... of Warcraft!
---
I have a partial solution,  make loot trading once or twice per day.  This will solve ops rolls or uproar over someone ninja something and community can then pressure said ninja or mistake to correct itself, and you won’t be able to abuse the system * too much to help friends gear up. I for one will be rolling on cloth for my wife running dungeons with me and trade her the loot. Imo there is nothing wrong with that
---
KT is rough as guts and will likely need full world buffs to clear, at least until the raid has a solid amount of naxx gear. Similar with C'thun. The rest doesn't need it really and you'll find with 40 man a coordinated raid with sensible gear/consumables matters far more than simple buffs as far as clearing content goes.
---
"before" pictures taken.
---
Are you a mod? This post is dumb enough for me to nominate you if you aren't. 
---
When you put it like that it actually does seem like a non-issue, yeah. 
---
I played BfA slowly for the story. After I finished all of the quest zones and dungeons... I quit and started reading the lore books. XD
---
This is officially true. All dissenters need not apply. Esfand eternally BTFO.
---
Guys, we clearly need a vanilla character model version of this meme format. Somebody who is talented please do this &lt;3
---
Its good looking and easy to tell which phase represents which raidtiers by the pictures in the class creens. When can we use it? :P
---
Amazing! I am looking forward. Great work
---
"gatekeeping" is how anti vaxxers and flat earthers pretend their opinions are equal to people with functioning brains, get out of here with your polio spreading garbage
---
Portals to capitals aren´t an issue. Rather, it´s the portals beneath central tower of Dalaran that are used for much of Legion order hall and artifact questlines, which were designed around them being a thing.
---
This is the main problem. Removal of feature integral to certain portion of the game. Looking at fitting Classic example, I would compare it to removal of flight paths or Hearthstone.
---
I am certain some hardcore MMO player from times before WoW would also smirk about it if Blizzard decided to remove them and people complained, because "back in my day, we had to walk everywhere". Does that make them right?
---
But would that work for mind controlled players as well?
---
Have you seen it work in vanilla?
---
This stuff is amazing. Keep it up!
---
Thunder clap, cleave-ish, seemed like there was something else.
---
This is awesome!!!
---
Yes, just controller should be friendly+ rep with Orgrimmar
---
then you aren't too bright
---
Could you elaborate on this please? I’m looking to start listening to some shows!
---
It'll be interesting for sure. On one hand, I do believe a lot of the "difficult raids" from vanilla could end up being quite easy with the knowledge we have now, I do see some stuff now and then bandied around as fact that seems wrong enough that I could be completely wrong and it could be super hard again (well, after MC and Onyxia, I still don't see that being hard).
---
This is one of those things I never knew I wanted until I saw it. Awesome work bro.
---
Well done
---
This thing is going to come up again and again, it'll be a massive shitshow.
---
Private servers get _so much_ wrong.
---
Nostalrius was still just MANGOS with a handful of issues fixed.
---
Cool!
---
I'm really torn between Paladin and Shaman rn :thinking: 
---
&gt; Loot trading will poison the key asset of this game: Community.
---
Have you tried community solutions, to this issue, called "Don't play with douchelords"?
---
If you want some item from a pug, or are inviting people to your group, consider social interaction. Of the form of: "How many people need _____"?
---
This is great! An android/ios app would be absolutely fantastic, too. 
---
Btw comment from old Thottbot:
---
rend_blackhand on 2006/06/13 (Patch 1.10.2)Subject: "alliance can get it"
---
I've mind controlled alliance before so that they could get the buff, it was pretty funny. They did die like two seconds after they got it though :)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=16609/warchiefs-blessing#comments
---
World pvp does mot mean levelling pvp. There are many skilked and geared players who enjoy "authentic" pvp in the wild. That being said, a huntard that doesn't expect a fight in the wild is certainly not on top of a tier list.
---
I see
---
Lol, what? 😂
---
I would even pay 💰 for this if it is downloadable as an app 👀 
---
It looks great! 
---
Get a ram, they're the BiS mounts anyway :) especially the PvP/armored ones
---
Huh, I like #2. I literally never heard of anyone contacting a GM to fix a loot issue when I played in vanilla, but I'd believe others did and I'm okay with Blizz saving cash on GMs for something like this, but just knowing if you got screwed would be a big step given how much server only dungeons meant reputation did matter.
---
Then both get put on my blacklist and I never see them again. Problem solved in a vanilla like way.
---
Sure, but that seems like a lot of time not spent behind a computer playing WoW, so I'll pass.
---
It’s vanilla bro, plenty of people who don’t actually need items are going to need them
---
Wow this is amazing! Is this going to be an app? Please keep us updated
---
I havent  got a single issue resolved during legion-bfa with gms, they are either not allowed to do anything or just some outsourced indian dudes from bangladesh doing copy paste answers.
---
In the early levels, it really doesn't matter IMO. But that's obvious, since the difference in talents is fairly small. 
---
Come \~30-40, the difference became noticeable to the naked eye from my experiences. But that's memories from 14 years back so... grain of salt and that. 
---
Honestly? The first re-spec is only 1 gold, so I'd start out with DPS stuff and then switch later. 
---
Who is ”everybody”? From my research, fury vs arm pre-40 is a 50/50 and comes down to a number of personal preferences.
---
Ninja-looting was a core aspect of Vanilla gameplay, that poisoned Vanilla WoW.
---
And you know what? You fucking dealt with it, with the tools you were given. Instead of complaining to devs about it.
---
:).
---
Autistic children still complain about non issues. Cute.
---
ya dude and they can ninja and suffer the consequences. why make it easy for people to be scummy?
---
It looks cool, but I am quite unsure about well the lists itself, it lack of alternatives and well it's not confirmed yet what kind of progression blizzard is gonna use, I seriously doubt they will be doing that 4 stage shit. 
---
Did the giant elite tyranasaurus get the jump on you too?!
---
I would love that as well! 👍🏻
---
Prototype or not, this looks great already! I love it. 
---
Just something I thought of though - Have you been thinking of also adding second-BiS too? Probably not needed for every item, but e.g. Thunderfury, there could be a secondary option under that one since it is so “hard” to get. 
---
It’s vanilla, they can ninja regardless 
---
This!
---
The thing is if you're doing 5 mans with level appropriate groups, the healing throughput or efficiency isn't going to be an issue and reducing incoming damage isn't going to be an issue so why waste all your talent point on those things? Priest I can sort of see the argument for, it's not really needed but it will make healing in dungeons more easy. Warrior on the other hand I don't really see why you'd ever go prot for levelling dungeons. Talents like cruelty, booming voice, enrage, tactical mastery, anger management, imp overpower, sweeping strikes are all super useful for tanking and I don't think getting the prot talents would even help that much. You'd probably actually be a worse tank because you've have such low dps.
---
Looks very good!
---
Thank you so much 
---
Beer-roasted Boar Ribs. I can make that. Roadted Quail also.
---
You can go there and get some Vanilla experience before the summer release! 
---
I can't speak for holy priest, but I wouldn't recommend leveling as a prot warrior. It's probably a good bit better in dungeons, but it really, REALLY doesn't matter for a long time.
---
Someone posted a video here some days ago of 10 bubble boys in WSG. Yes, it was pure aids lmao!! 
---
Now you’re going deep in prepping for classic:-D
---
Cool cool. Thankyou very much for the advise
---
Much better than a Google doc
---
I have this thought constantly.  I've been on the Classic hype train for a while and at least once every other week I'll question if I really want to associate myself with such a negative community in a game where the community aspect is held up as its greatest feature.  It's also confusing because the Classic crowd should theoretically be older but you can go to most posts on this sub and see at least one person calling another a fucking idiot or something equally as immature.
---
So, it's all about experience/knowledge ? World Buff or 1.12 won't change the experience :o ?
---
Damn, from what i understand i'm not gonna die for months in MC anymore... My Classic progression will end sooner than expected
---
Rod of Ogre Magi. Talisman of E Peen. Anathema/Benediction. 
---
Same, think it is a good thing to add seeing that we wont have GMs like before to sort out theese issues.
---
And then probably most of their tickets before was about loot being given to the wrong person so this would clear out a lot of tickets.
---
I didn't imply that ~~but I can see how you might think~~ haha just kidding, can you even read at all?
---
We arranged for a trip to Tanzania as my girlfriend spent some time studying to be a healer (nurse) in Tanga. We figured we should go on a safari, and then I realized Ngorongoro was one of my options! I made it my quest to convince her to join me! 
---
&gt; One of the players, who cannot use the item, wins it. He then gives it, via Loot Trading, to his guild-mate who lost the roll. That example is pretty blatant and unlikely, since you can probably complain to a GM and win the item back.
---
GMs won't do this and never have, not sure where you're getting that.  The ninja looter would have to agree and open the ticket himself.
---
They are the two main classic wow shows/podcasts. I feel like one of them cares about the viewers, while the other cares about views. But that’s just my opinion, check them both out and decide for yourself. I think the better show will stick out to you
---
Personally, I would not say dwarf priest. The problem with dwarf priest is that they are played by the (in my personal opinion) are played by the kind of people that I rarely click well with. I’d rather have a humble druid that is keeping it real tbh.
---
It doesn't matter enough to be worth it unless you're deadset on the idea of slow dungeon crawling with great ease. Any spec priest or warrior of appropriate level can rise to the challenge of any 5man.
---
After level 40 there's no doubt about arms being better. Mortal Strike is too good. Pre-L40 either or is about the same imho.
---
Having that mob at 1%, waiting on that 3.5+ second swing is so painful
---
This looks amazing!! 
---
Cardio is best for this sort of thing fwiw. Also learn what your best sleeping routine is if you're a powerleveler.
---
this looks amazing! looking forward to bookmark this 😉
---
...and also (unpopular opinion) highlights the issue the playerbase will face once we reach “Stage 4”.
---
True that it’s a double edged sword, but I don’t think you get called out that often. You can just say if you don’t know the way and someone else will point it out. They won’t be that upset; and if they are, what’ll they do, kick you and find a new tank? 
---
You can improvise most 5 man pulls once you know about marking and cc’s.
---
For wsg less rogues more mages is king.
---
I assume these are all based on 1.12 itemization?
---
I remember a Human Paladin on Mazrigos called Revenger and he used to destroy in PvP, literally used to sit in Stranglethorn as a Hordie and just watch it all unfold.. Good times
---
Back in my days, we didn't even have a Need option .\_.'
---
We had "Roll" and "Pass" or something. You had to manually tell people need or greed and some people would literally roll on everything. 
---
I'm not sure if I want to relive that experience authentically &lt;.&lt;
---
This looks sick! Are you building this phone first or cross platform?
---
Being a hunter with Rhok is awesome, it says "I know what the fuck I'm doing".
---
Your trade chat spam will get you laughed at, told to stop 'QQing', right click reported, yelled at for spamming, and ultimately nobody will care IF they believe you.
---
To me your post is like a woman who is surprised she can't hit men and not get hit back. If he has a problem with whining and he vents that I don't see him as a hypocrite when he didn't start the whining. Not the same thing.
---
This will never be forgotten! 
---
"what can't be equipped" did he edit his comment or are you talking about the pally healer using a cloth chest?  All healers use some cloth.
---
how would you even know they did that?
---
Jesus christ people.. Tips is a nice guy trying to make a living. Stop demonizing people for making small mistakes. People should be able to fuck up and not have everyone hate them forever.
---
Shopping list. After selecting which gear tier you're after, the app will generate a shopping list for those items. This is mostly useful for pre-raid BiS.  
---
The shopping list is a simple item list in text form with the dungeon/quest/location that item comes from, and what boss.  
---
Example list:  
---
Lionheart Helm - Crafted - Blacksmithing  
---
Mark of Fordring - Quest - In Dreams  
---
Truestrike Shoulders - UBRS - Pyroguard Emberseer  
---
Etc.  
---
Include a button that allows you to check the item off your list after you acquire it.  
---
Options for custom lists, etc.  
---
Them needing on the item when they either can’t use it or already have it?
---
Totally random/off topic question since I've seen you post here a lot on PvP/WoW in general, what do you think of Wrath. I saw you disliked TBC for a lot of reasons, was Wrath a good xpac in your mind or no?
---
 Jesus christ people.. Tips is a nice guy trying to make a living. Stop demonizing people for making small mistakes. People should be able to fuck up and not have everyone hate them forever. 
---
Giving is good, but feeling used and rolling with it is a slippery slope and opens the door to people exploiting you. Don't do more for people than they earn.
---
I'll be honest, I'm not completely sure. I do think it's going to be a lot easier, but it will really depend on what the population is like and what groups you're playing with.
---
If Classic is popular and there are hardcore progression guilds, nothing is going to last long for them. Even in vanilla the majority of stuff that lasted a long time for progression guilds was either because people couldn't figure out how to do it (4 horsemen) or because it was bugged/impossible (Ragnaros, C'Thun). That's not going to be the case now. That said, I don't know who's really going to be playing. There could be groups where it's still hard because people aren't playing that much and aren't that good.
---
1.12 and World Buffs will make stuff easier, but I don't know that it'll be a tremendous difference vs it's just all easier the second time anyway.
---
but you wont even know with loot trading, you're not the brightest i guess.
---
He's a classic content creator. You think he's not going to talk about news when we get it? Who pissed in your cheerios?
---
Healing is my favorite thing to do in WoW, and Paladin is probably my favorite healer, but boy does it suck to be out in the world by yourself. You do no damage, and unless you've been getting T2+ for the memes (which you should, it looks sick), your actual BiS items are mostly all cloth and leather like someone else mentioned. 
---
I'm having to resort to just farming Herbs endlessly to make any money whatsoever because god forbid I have to grind mobs. I'll probably have to level an alt Hunter. :(
---
I’d pay couple bucks for it
---
It says it's a proto type, implying it's more than likely not even 20% done.
---
Very impressed with what you have so far, I saved the post and will be looking forward to updated and am hopeful that you continue this little project.
---
Yes you will, you will see them need the item. It’s no different to how it is usually but you can trade the loot 
---
It's completley unrelated to server client.
---
Enrage was change in TBC to proc while sitting, you can find it somewhere in the patches. All vanilla servers are based on TBC  or wrath servers, and then downscaled to vanilla, this means that some TBC or wrath things stay, in this case it was enrage proccing on sit criticals. 
---

---
There are a lot of pieces that can be need by rogues war hunters and troll rets, like truestrike shoulders. 
---
Genuinely the best Vanilla series out there. It's not stacked with trivia or anything like that, but it absolutely nails why anyone who played back then loved the game. 
---
It's the first time I see that "going to the second roll etc" idea and it's an excellent idea. I like your system a lot. 
---
thats why they unequip it before the dungeon. is that really so hard to grasp?
---
You quite obviously didn't even read the comment above 
---
This is why it was called ”idiots guide”. Let me explain this yet again: disregarding need items from loot trading makes loot trading IRRELEVANT from a blizz perspective. Get this.
---
Nice, I'd get this for sure. Could you be more specific about what the stages mean? Like before which raid or patch? Not super familiar with bis in classic. 
---
That’s a lot of effort to go to for a random item that will get replaced week one of raiding 
---
Enrage is really the only thing that makes fury decent, and if classic is made properly at launch(which it likely WONT, this was confirmed in latest post), then arms is better no matter how you twist it.
---
And even then, with enrage proccing on sit, it's not really that much better.  Arms has a clear advantage in PVP encounters(winning pvp fights will overall save you a lot of time and well will be fun!), in dungeons too which is usually a fairly large part of dungeon leveling since you need gear, so you wanna do at least one run of most the quest dungeons.
---
Fury is better for killing mobs at your level, however when killing lower lvl mobs arms is actually better by using sweeping strikes. 
---
i guess logic is not working on you. good luck
---
Awesome!!! I would pay for this too. Please please please add the ability to create your own tabs or stages too. Just for those random wants or needs.
---
It could also be useful to add a way to navigate through the stages while a class is already selected, rather than having the stages be higher in the waterfall than classes.
---
This is exactly what we need
---
Holy priest is really not that bad leveling as shadow spec assuming you still get spirit tap in shadow, improved wands in disc, and the smite damage talents in holy. I would say you level 1.5x slower as holy.
---
Leveling as prot warrior though, I would not be surprised if you leveled 3x slower than arms or fury. I would only recommend leveling prot warrior if you had a friend who leveled with you because then you can be their personal tank and they can kill the mob. 
---
If it can go wrong, it will. This is why nobody calls for the complete removal of backspace on keyboards, consumer returns, divorces, job quitting and so on and so on. Nobody gets everything right every time, obviously. 
---
This is amazing bro. You could get this site a lot of traffic come classic :) 
---
&gt;because I hated Rogues more than I enjoyed playing other classes.&lt; You, my friend, are living life the right way. I like your style.
---
Can't find my other comment because mobile...
---
As most people will only have one raiding main - at least for a while, I think having the option to create lists *per* class would be extremely useful.
---
&gt; I would only recommend leveling prot warrior if you had a friend who leveled with you because then you can be their personal tank and they can kill the mob.  
---
Which would still be better to do as arms.  
---
&gt; Cardio is best for this sort of thing fwiw.
---
For health, yes. But I also need some muscle strength, so I won't end up unable to carry my monthly shopping after 4 weeks of nolifing :Ð and I have no car.
---
&gt; learn what your best sleeping routine is if you're a powerleveler
---
I'm not a powerleveler, but I'll be playing on a PVP server, so proper sleeping routine is important.
---
At the moment, I'm on the paleo-arctic sleeping routine (going to sleep in late afternoon, getting up in early evening, then going to sleep in late night and getting up in the morning)
---
But the problem is:
---
1. My health preparations include fixing my teeth. And there is no direct flight to Poland, which will devastate my routine.
---
2. I'll probably have a summer job, as my tradition since childhood. That's a big problem.
---
LINK
---
adress
---
I would disagree on the first part. The crit is too sweet and makes deep wounds so much better. I usually take it first. And then you respec 1t 40 for ms obviously.
---
Good idea
---
what? did you ever play vanilla? truestrike shoulders, reed, baron cape and so on will be serious grinds since you have alot competition on them.
---
actually you probably never played vanilla, so ill stop this here, so much stupidity is triggering me.
---
Yeah, it's ridiculous to think competetive people wouldn't use every tool available to them to get an edge over orhers. Not saying it's cool, but ofcourse people will need for their friends.
---
Pretty much everything you've mentioned is the core of the reasoning for people saying that classic will fail. Too much egoism and too few altruism exists in todays gaming society. We now know what WoW is. There's far fewer incentives for people and go discover things.
---
I, too, think that Classic is going to have a very difficult time. Not because there's no people that want to play classic the classic way but much rather because there's too many people who are - at their core - made out of todays gamers (you know, those egoistic ones - "It's about MY fun, not theirs...").
---
I'm mostly looking at classic about 6-12 months down the line. At that point we'll see which type of player perseveres. If it's the later on the majority of servers I don't see classic being any fun for me.
---
Taking the 5 crit and then respeccing at 40 is probably the way to go. Parry might be much better than improved hs though, I think we should test that. 
---
Amazing.
---
Yeah, but I can understand wanting to be that sword and board tank while leveling. 
---
You tell them bro!
---
i think parry is weak because i think the optimal fight is not too hard, i mean you arguably shouldnt be killing nything above ur lvl too much
---
Thanks for this excellent writeup. We definitely need to keep our heads and priorities straight here.
---
Hopefully this will also put an end to the ”it’s just g items” idiot argument. 
---
If there can be drama, there will be drama, if it can go wrong it will.
---
@0:23 Did I just see \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
Jesus, guys. I was already excited for Classic WoW, but this ...I think I'm about to go \[Anal\].
---
Why not both? Use a switch macro, change weapons where appropriate.  
---
Yep, alliance rogue on blackrock 
---
I want this, link it 
---
What excel document are you using? I’m a very experienced rogue who theorycrafts a lot. The last lists I’ve seen doesn’t have 100% bis for the various stages for rogues. 
---
Amazing
---
He practically admitted this in the title. So if you click it knowing this, you basically do so because you know and trust Esfand to provide you with some worthwhile comments and insights.
---
It’s fine.
---
yeah, gotta be fresh and healthy to be prepared when you're going to be destroying your body by sitting in a chair 18 hours a day
---
I have some experience with multiple low level warriors on different server launches:
---
I think from 1-10 its fine to use a 1h and shield, but when you get the chance to get talents like either improved overpower or cruelty, going down the protection tree is really brutal.
---
I tried myself, using a 1h and shield, with cruelty, until level 20 as I waited for duel wielding. On the next server I rolled on, using a 2h straight up just made me shed a tear.
---
If you want to use a shield and go prot, go for it, it's doable.
---
However, you really don't need to go protection or holy, in order to take part in dungeons while levelling. The game's not THAT punishing. You can tank with just demoralizing shout and sunder, while levelling.
---
Looks very nice. I see many people saying, that they'd like an app of this. You know, you can post your website to the app-store as an app. I haven't done this myself, but it should be doable.
---
Well if you were able to read my comment you would see logic.
---
Its just amazing. Well done mate
---
Prot doesnt really have anything worthwhile, revenge doesnt hit that much and for thunder clap you need to switch to battle stance. Cleave can be spammed but costs rather big chunk of rage and with 1hander doesnt deal that much damage. 
---
Judging by your comments YOU didn’t play vanilla, you played private servers. Where every player cares about “bis”.
---
Wow this looks awesome 
---
It's as simple as that. Period. 
---
It's really awesome seeing things like the UI and models and art design, having evolved from the game.
---
Tons of ability icons straight from WC3 too.
---
I love u!!!
---
It says in chat how many online though, even if it doesn't show them. 
---
I love you both
---
I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice to stay away based on that. 
---
In every larger conglomerate of people, there will be people you'll find agreeable and people that you'd really rather stay away from. 
---
It won't be different in Classic. I'm sure that regardless of your particular views, you'll be able to find at least a guild full of people that are compatible with them. And that's all you need to enjoy the game. 
---
As for maturity - Think of it as the peak between growing up and turning rotten. It doesn't have as much to do with age as people like to think and all too many people unfortunately mistake rot for maturity. 
---
Sick dude!
---
If you need any help hmu! This looks great sp far and id love to see it ezpanded even farther!
---
add so if you press a item slot for example, helmet, you see list of maybe top 5 or 10 BiS items in that slot for that spec instead of seeing the absolute best one. Whould be good incase of legendaries being BiS since they are alot harder to get
---
Well, if it is that much damage you don't have to bandage for it might be faster than improved hs. It's all that matters really. 
---
Just let them do their thing. AB definatly got that 8X% of this subreddit is against loot trading and sharding. 
---
They explained why they are considering it and that they will be open to suggestions that are made here or in the forums and will check their feasibility internal.
---
So PLEASE if you don't have a suggestion or anything new... STOP the whining. 
---
It is if mob stays alive that long. If you take care of your gear you will have a bigboi weapon to smack things dead before rend is expires and if you have good gear you can handle 2 mobs at a time making cleave better rage spender. Atleast thats my take on it
---
And I'm providing useful critism? Why do you have to be a dick?
---
Keep working on it, this is good. If you manage to drive enough traffic you could maybe even sell the finished concept to a site like wowhead.
---
Wow boy are you entitled....
---
to nothing.
---
Roll stacking will be an issue though because it's so easy to do. 
---
GrumbleGrumble?!
---
Quick, get this man some meat! 
---
what a story mark
---
You should talk to the guys from https://www.classicwow.live 
---
Kargoz &amp; Co. are planning a lot of things and this might be one of them. 
---
I'd also pay for an app, since I'm currently doing the excel grind. 
---
Can someone just tell me what bis means?
---
Whoa, wasn't trying to be a dick. Not sure what I possibly said that would have implied any aggressive tone at all but my bad I guess.
---
Agreed but it's not a vanilla interaction and I don't think the purpose of Classic is to create better loot systems.
---
That looks... bland.
---
and what's worse, it will be summer... hot... no refreshment
---
Looks great! :)
---
Def &amp; meld are one of my favorites. Melderons shamans guides are unmatched. The amount of analysis he does is outstanding. Everyone has fluff videos sadly. Kargoz I would say is one of the best collaboraters for classic content creators. Madseason has to be the best delovery. Frost has the most unique videos. It's good when creators can find a niche
---
Haha thank you
---
Best in slot.
---
You sir are the true hero! 
---
You’ve taken something boring (excel documents) and made it fun and useful! 
---
Well done! 
---
In BGs it depends on the BG you're doing.  
---
Druids are crucial because they're king of flag running. Mages are obviously important for the midfield control aspect and their ability to peel for healers. Rogues are important for flag room defense since they can force Druids into blowing cooldowns during their entry to flag or flat out kill them.
---
...I could go on. Long story short is that every class serves a unique role.
---
If you're asking which class can solo carry through most PvP content the answer is Mage, Hunter or Rogue are the most well rounded classes in PvP. Great in world PvP, great in BGs. They all have their restrictions, but relative to all other classes they come out on top.
---
This looks great.
---
iPhone LUL
---
Most mobs won't die before rend expires, and it would still be worth using even if you don't get the last tick.
---
Cleave might be useful but don't forget it costs an auto attack so it costs a lot more rage. Fighting 2 mobs at a time means a lot more incoming damage and downtime.

Doubtful, the private server community hate Blizzard so much that they'll find something else to obsess about. 
---
Maybe for role playing sake. Or just liking the feel for sword and board over dual wield or twohander.
---
Is there any video evidence from retail servers? Maybe of a lock summoning?
---
Well if it ran WoD, it'll run classic most likely, if you want to get something new then here's my recommendation (Prices are from Germany, look up your countries pricing)
---
CPU: Ryzen 3 2200G (But imo, you should wait till July and get the Zen2 equivallent of that CPU) 86€ [Use stock cooler, more than enough if not overclocking, even for OC it has *some* headroom]
---
RAM: Cheapest 8GB DDR4 you can get (although i would really recommend going with 16GB) 8GB = ~45€
---
MOBO: Cheapest B450 AM4 Board you can get.
---
GPU: You can try running it off of the CPU's integrated GPU but the experience may not be satisfying, so go for a rx 570 (~140€) or again wait for AMD's new Navi lineup which is rumored to come in July too, or wait for Nvidias gtx 1650 or gtx 1660.
---
Storage: Some 1TB HDD ~40€ (also i recommend getting an additional SSD for your OS and WoW, 256GB = ~30€)
---
Case: I wouldn't go for the absolute cheapest case as it will be shit quality, but there's no point of going fancy with the case, especially in budget builds.
---
PSU: ! DO NOT CHEAP OUT ! Get something good, my suggestion is some XFX or Seasonic 400-500W Gold certified PSU, ~55-65€. (Cheap PSU's can and will eventually fuck something in your System, in the best case they will fuck up themselves, in the worst, your GPU, CPU, Mobo, Ram, everything...) 
---
To give you a real answer, it is worth it, you WILL want cruelty on pretty much any level or specc EXCEPT between 40-44 or so. You see, you will want mortal strike at 40, so if you’ve specked into cruelty pre-40 (which I would recommend) you will want to do your first respecc at 40 for mortal strike. Then keep your specc the same until 60 and respecc to fury (or prot)
---
It gives you a real appreciation for the small things they added into wow, I remember playing WC3 for the first time a couple years ago and seeing something I remembered from wow and it made me smile.
---
No what they are doing is already Marketing.
---
But I understand what you mean. 
---
Pretty close to the basics. Most important thing is Nova for rogues, silence and meditation. Here's mine for troll priest:

There's like 2-3 pts you can juggle around with but for the most part I would pick this
---
Nice. I would absolutely use this resource. 
---
That's a shame. Platinum had the best end-game and Black/White 2 had the best story, the two games being chronological and interesting plot-wise.
---
How many?
---
id pay for this
---
This looks amazing!
---
Very nice! I'll keep on eye out for this when classic comes. Would be nice of there was some info where you can get each item. What boss drops it or if it's a random drop or craftable. 
---
what? I can only think of maybe two pservers that didnt fuck up the even most simple things in the game, and one of them doesn’t exist anymore.
---
Honestly I thought people would be happy, the world is dead, at least traveling through it would make it feel bigger. Sitting in your main city, waiting for a queue to pop and instantly traveling via portals is awful, might as well just be a lobby menu and not an MMO.
---
Jezus i want this
---
Amazing! I do have to say, the stages are quite confusing for me as I prefer to think in Tiers and whatnot. Is stage a common thing?
---
Being Prot or Holy doesn’t make your role any better in pre 60 dungeons. Fury can tank equally well and shadow priest can heal equally well. 
---
Nobuo Uematsu would like a word.

I remember in the game manual it said to not have the name xlegolasx as that wouldn't be very original, idk why I remember that so vividly but yeah.
---
It’s generally accepted that 2h fury is slightly faster till level 40 and then Arms is better. 
---
Looks great. But what I miss the most is what's NOT pure bis but slightly worse. Like I know mantle of the blackwing cabal is bis for My mage but how much better is it than t2? What's 2nd or 3rd bis? That I can't find anywhere.
---
Reasonably common but not totally necessary. People do it mostly to be competitive with each other; if you have DM trib buff and that rogue who always out DPS you doesn’t, you now have a better chance of outperforming him. That incentivises him to take the buff, in turn making everyone else do it to compete with him etc.
---
Don’t despair about it though. The fact you lose them after 1 death or 2 hours makes them much less reliable for progression than you’d think. As others said, for progression past BWL or so you’ll have an Ony/ZG buff each week anyway, and you don’t have to do anything for those except get summoned to the location or whatever.
---
One group can run DM tribute, which is only abou 25 mins anyway, before the raid and everyone else can cycle in and out of that party and instance to quickly grab the buff.
---
Gordo represent!
---
Would be nice if, apart from the default BiS lists, the app would allow people to create and share their own custom lists (possible with rating system). Just dropping an idea here :) It looks nice.
---
The point I wanted to make was that back then, with gear being gained at a glacial pace, douchebagey behaviour hit really harder. Heck, in WotLK as I was grinding VH for tank pants, after 50 tries they drop and boi o boi do they get ninjaed and eventually DEed in front of my pleading char. But hey, back then, you could work towards gear with tokens and whatnot. 
---
In Vanilla? Not so much. Back then, a single blue drop could cause people to go instanuke mode. People would literally hire 60s to get them to SM so they could get the triune amulet because even warriors would ninja it because "it has stamina hurr durr". 
---
Point is, "community" and "server family" is all romantic and funny until suddenly you would love to see some people's faces slammed on their keyboards. Sure, getting the recognition in a closed community is far more satisfying - but what is the price in time and frustration? Sure, I loved being amongst the most wanted mages in my server by the opposing fraction, but if you ask me what I remember from 2007 I can only say "BWL AQ". Nothing else. Just "BWL AQ". Because that's the only way to actually progress in the damn game, by sacrificing everything else and going through waves of frustration and pain because of the assholes. 
---
Pre-60, as a healer, I'll roll on healing stuff but I'm mostly there for DPS stuff. I can't quest by healing mobs to death.
---
At 60, as a healer, in 5-toon runs anything that is a +healing upgrade or mana regen upgrade I'll take.
---
On private servers even casual guilds go for world buffs. It’s become a standard thing. They do it because it makes the raid content that much easier and faster. It has nothing to do with killing “impossible” bosses because those don’t exist in vanilla.
---
You're right 3/40 is low, but we regularly ran 5-6 warriors even back in 1.2. MC mechanics demanded multiple tanks, so you needed a bench of warriors for those fights. While not tanking the dps warriors were doing respectable damage but not bullshit they do in 1.12. Only running 3 warriors wouldn't be fair, but no such situation has ever existed in vanilla due to encounter design. Meanwhile running 8-10 warriors like we see on eternal 1.12 servers is pretty lame.
---
Druid is one of the hardest classes to play in Vanilla. Feral tanking is hard, feral dps is hard, even healing which is supposed to be their "good" spec is hard. They are a very versatile class though, especially in PvP where they are really fun to run flags with. You can also take a feral druid, resto druid and 3 rogues to stealth in and destroy some towers in AV. 
---
They’re actually colossal issues and the sole reason why Classic won’t be anything like vanilla or private servers. 
---
Blizzard didn’t mention them because they’re not going to change it. Classic will ship with loot trading, phasing and spell batching and it’s gonna suck big time. 
---
It can be annoying while levelling on a lower population server, but a lot of those have a chat you can /join that lets you grind and LFG at the same time anyway. When you hit 60 it will take you approx 5 mins to find any group as a tank. 
---
Once you’re in the group it will almost definitely form around you because tanks are the hardest to find, so if you’re not leader you can go grind while you wait for it to form, then head to the instance.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there were both Rare and Rare-Elites back in vanilla that both had the same silver dragon. I remember being able to kill certain rares no problem, and then getting demolished by others.
---
It's possible that private servers just put in Rare-Elites.
---
Is sit/crit actually a bug? It seems like the kind of thing that would have been added in vanilla for the sake of realism. Like if you're sitting or lying down an enemy is gonna hit your weak points easier. Was it not the case in the demo?
---
It’s pretty clear at this point that Classic won’t be anything like vanilla. 
---
This is excellent, and, combined with OPs app, a much better version of the ingame addon I've planned to make. Will take inspiration from this. Thanks.
---
I guess it depends on the p server. All the ones I have played on the pet stayed until the other was summoned.
---
&gt;if it is really worth it in dungeons
---
No, this is a stupid idea, you're getting cute just level as arms.
---
What's important is
---
* Not being under leveled for the dungeon.  Do not step into Uldaman at 38 thinking you're going to tank.  Same goes for healers/dps, you can technically heal under leveled for the dungeon but you're a liability in dungeons where people like to skip trash.
---
* Not being a shitter, know how to use your toolkit and what skills are actually relevant.  Just because you started out with heroic strike doesn't mean you should use it and demo shout might pull all those neutral mobs and just because you sit in defensive stance doesn't mean you can't dance out real quick to mocking blow the thing that's eating your healers face.  Maybe sneak in a little overpower or sweeping strikes.
---
* Leadership, knowing the dungeon well enough to assign CC targets and kill order or delegate that to someone who does.  IE, kill or cc the mana burning fucks that are nuking your healer.
---
* Keeping your weapon relevant, your lvl 10 warrior quest sword isn't going to cut it when you want to tank RFK at 35.
---
* Consumables are pretty op, nature protection and frost protection potions come to mind.
---

Balance wise, TBC and Wrath are infinitely better than Vanilla pvp. Wrath is by many considered to be the pinnacle of WoW pvp. 
---
Would be even cooler with leveling guides!
---
Here is my take on this. I have leveled arms to 60 solo and fury to 50 with a mage friend. I never respecced and fetched ww axe as quickly as possible. Overall fury seems to start stronger with faster kill speed due to 5% crit and enrage + flurry. However this is only if /sit enrage works and i am sure it will not work on classic. Arms on the other hand has solid time with imp. overpower and deep wounds. Also you will have easier time in pvp for arms with tactical mastery and tanking is easier when you can do thunder claps on demand. Also when you hit 40 arms gets the big killer button of MS, while fury gets lesser button bloodthirst that compensates by healing a bit.
---
Overall i would recommend going arms just for pvp and tanking purposes. Always keep your weapon in check and updated for it will make your life so much easier. If you can get a healer with you so the leveling is super ez.
---
Tier list are funny in wow because they mean so many things to different people, some want the best without taking into account racials, some want the best without taking into account professions and consumables, and others want a list that takes into account both.
---
I don't think you can even have a tier list for BG's using WSG as an example, optimal premade WSG has at least one of every class. AB isn't quite as diverse but still not enough to make a tier list. Really at the highest levels the whole game becomes in a roundabout way about overwhelming enemy healers, curse of tongues, viper sting, MS, CC, blessings, purges, separating their DPS, and whichever team does the best job at it, wins the teamfights, but its not just about winning teamfights, rogues/mages/druids also have an interesting cat and mouse game of trying to get the flag out of the room, then when the game switches to both flags being held the meta changes again, I don't think there is a way to quantify any sort of best class because of how volatile the situations you can find yourself in are.
---
World pvp you can narrow it down a good bit, stealth classes have the leg up because they get to choose engagements, classes with high mobility similarly get to pick and choose their fights, and then last on the tier list would be classes that are just outright hard to kill and not worth the time for many specs to bother fighting. So if I was gonna make a tier list that doesn't take into account engineering it would look something like Rogue, Druid, Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Paladin, Priest, shaman, warrior. Again though engineering, consumables/racials all make a huge difference a warrior isn't a great 1v1 class for the most part, but if you have a bag full of FAP's and the other guy doesn't the list would change dramatically. There is also some rock paper scissors mixed in as well, jumping a paladin as a rogue for examples usually doesn't end well.
---
Lastly 1v1's this is probably the closest you could make to a real tier list, but again it depends on what the person reading it wants. Duels without engineering/consumables play out vastly different than ones with. Strong choices are SL lock, Spriest, Rogue, Mage1
---
You don’t need to be resto specced to heal dungeons when levelling, you can do it perfectly fine as enhance/ele
---
Goiben uden lo!
---
Not sure I agree with you there. Blessings are amazing, much better than battle shout. Having a spare rezzer who can also prevent wipes with DI is nice. The reflect damage a prod paladin puts out is insane, much more than a warrior tank, in a 5 man it's almost like having a 4th dpser. The downsides of the paladin are the mana management and lack of panic buttons for when things go wrong. But even then with engineering paladins can build enough early threat quickly that the chance of dps pulling goes way down.
---
I didn't had the chance to play the game back then (started 2-3 weeks before Cata) but watching his series makes me really excited for Classic. I haven't play on any Vanilla, BC or Wrath server so I can enjoy a "blizzard experience" on Classic.
---
This is amazing! Thank you so much for your hard work. If I may suggest, I'd expand the BiS with second, third best etc.  Sometimes a BiS item is just damn hard to obtain, while the second best item is rather easily farmed/crafted.
---
Please have the top three for each item. Also, instead of saying stage one or two can you put like pre-raid and so forth. Awesome work. This is the type of addon that thousands would download when fleshed out. 
---
The nature res BiS will be so helpful between ZG and AQ and it looks like we'll have a window to grab it.
---
Looks so amazing, mate, keep it up
---
Nice
---
Aw not true haha
---
True for low levels rend is fine. And i forgot that you can also do whirlwind instead cleave to generate rage from auto. I feel like its more worthwhile to cast whirlwind once you get learn it. And MS at 40+. I could be wrong, i have only leveled 2 warriors to 30+ on private vanillas.
---
Not in these guilds that will go for world firsts
---
Woohoo! Can’t wait to see it.
---
Eh, that's a pretty negative view. I played through all of classic and I think I only ever really got fucked out of loot once (boe epic got ninjad)
---
Other than that it was awesome community wise. I'd trade back thens community over nowadays gear flood any day of the week.
---
Big highs always bear the risk of low falls but you will remember all of it and ultimately making memories is what it's all about. And the achievements in classic simply all meant more than nowaday's because they contrast so hard against all the shit you went through to get there. Nowadays it's all just a mash of mediocrity. I cannot remember a single item from Hellfire Citadel but boy do I remember the Molten Core loot table. 
---
Only reason to go another race is to go mage, lock, druid or admittedly hunter for the NElf bow skill.
---
No healer should level up in their healing spec, its a waste of time. 
---
All you need is to collect gear with Int on it, and keep it for dungeons. That will more than enough ensure you can do any dungeon.
---
Just go Enhance and respec to Resto at max level, when you are hitting harder content.
---
https://imgur.com/a/HiShiiO
---
Seeing rogues pop evasion when 1v1 ohhhh boy!!
---
You really dont want to level as elemental.  Its downtime is higher than any other leveling spec.  Also elemental is the most talent dependent.  If you really want to level as elemental I suggest waiting until level 40 before doing so.
---
Another thing you could add is something that shows if the item is game BiS. Some items from MC and BWL are game BiS and people should know that.
---
when you whine about people whining making you one of the people whining... ironic

---
&gt;I would disagree on the first part. The crit is too sweet and makes deep wounds so much better.
---
No, you're just delaying everything else that's makes the spec work by 5 levels.  I'll forgo 1,2,3,4,5% crit for five levels with 3/3 Deep Wounds.  Five more levels without Sweeping Strikes right when you hit the grind fest STV?  You're going to get that crit mid 30's when you flesh out axe spec anyways.  
---
The problem is that the same thing can happen with loot sharing. If you do a dungeon alone and they're 4 friends yet you need something and for a random reason one of the 4 needs it too the 4 friends can actually press need and give it to the person that isn't you even if you rolled higher than him but still lost to his friends. An asshole is an asshole anyway and loot sharing is just a bullshit excuse. We need to be more vocal about it and make them not implement it because it's really really bad. 
---
True.  I'm just often somewhat controversial on this board about Classic but rarely, if ever, simply contrarian; in other words, I do believe in everything I'm saying and am respectul of others.
---
However, having played almost all of Classic WoW, I do sympathize with the "no changes" concept and respect it, even if I personally disagree with it.
---
Agreed!
---
My suggestion would be to have the drop information always shown when an item is clicked instead of it being a clicked drop down, and have a clickable drop down which lists the next few items (2nd bis, 3rd bis, etc.)
---
Seriously. If this is put on the play store, I'd pay for it no doubt. This is awesome. 
---
Agreed! 
---
Lets be real here 
---
Very detailed troll here, “no changes” , “must make bosses harder” 
---
Well fuck....
---
Once sweeping strikes comes online it's kill one mob pool rage, cleave two down, repeat.  There's zero downtime between pulls unless you're fighting mobs more than a level above you.
---
i wonder how much gold you can save by only ussing the most damage per arrow shots during leveling
---
I LOVE YOU
---
&gt; i think parry is weak because i think the optimal fight is not too hard, i mean you arguably shouldnt be killing nything above ur lvl too much
---
But it's better than heroic strike...which you shouldn't be using.
---
I know what you mean (first mage in guild to complete Arcanist) but in retrospect, the time consumed and the frustration and the seer madness of "8pm to 9pm warm up 5 man and lowbies gear up, 9pm to 0am raid, pvp till 1.30am to spent up raid frustration", 7 days a week again and again and again, just in order to be able to be kinda competitive in the game, well, it takes a toll on you. Add to that the frustration because e.g. you had the known assholes but you had to face them and sometimes team up with them, add up the known gankers and pvpers and suddenly you understand that you sometimes feel you are stuck in a house with a very dysfunctional family. Not to mention the people in the 40man that always forgot the spell ingredients, forgot to buff, forgot to move properly, missed the spell sequence, or, even worse, got sick (or, even worse, had a night out) and couldn't come in the progress run. All of that for just the immense joy of being the first person in the guild to get the Claw of Chromaggus (through DKP, ofc!) and the person who got deprived of Neltharion's tear most times and got to see the guildie who won it DE it during first days of TBC. Dog friggin damnit. 
---
On the bright side, I still remember that bidding war when even the GM and the officers were whispering on me "BREATHE, REMEMBER TO BREATHE!" and after going on 50dkp increments against another mage and he even whispered to me "please", I outbid him by 700 dkp just because. "1565 dkp damn your cheap hide!"... so, yeah. A vivid memory. But was this memory and 2-3 more worth a year of grinding with the aforementioned schedule? 
---
Looks awesome!
---
Damn really? I get good results doing it, it seems to work for me.
---
I only rend at the start of a fight with a mob, because I end up like I don't get as much value from it when I do it close to 50% of their hp.
---
Something that could be nice is a consumables list for your class/roll and enchants would be dope too.
---
Resto talents doesnt actually offer much for healing and is only needed for raids and maybe some end-game dungeons. As long as you have some gear with intellect and a couple mana potions for when someone overpulls you can use any spec in dungeons.
---
Enh is best and ele is viable at lvl 39 but as ele you will go oom all the time. At end-game dungeons ele can be very good with really high damage in green/blue gear and you can drink between pulls.
---
What makes enh spec great while leveling is that you can dps and heal and tank group quests and even some dungeons if needed. When you are dps in a dungeon you can help with healing if needed while doing good damage with melee. Just carry a 2h for pvp/quests/dungeon dps and a 1h+shield for quests/tanking group quests and some weapon with int/heal for healing.
---
Wait, \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\] is one-handed?
---
Hmm... perhaps there hasn't been enough of Vanilla, to explore it completely.....
---
Agree with this completely. It would be too lame if items are being ninjad between friends in the same guild. I see just leave everything as it is, why the intervention?
---
You're talking about people who have had the luxury of portals everywhere for many years. You can't really take it away from people at this stage because they'll throw a tantrum over their convenient game becoming less convenient.
---
Remember that most of the people that'd be interested in a less convenient game have long since left and are probably just waiting for Classic if anything.
---
Go on..
---
The options for custom list is great!
---
Perhaps room to import user made BIS lists?
---
Great work!
---
After 40 elemental is the fastest, and prior to 40... Its not the greatest BC you don't have the lightning cast speed reduction, or crit multiplier talents that essentially make it work.
---
1h and flametoung with shield however is the most consistent for general leveling after late 20's when melee DPs vs mob health starts to slow down.
---
Thought so, thanks just checking
---
I remember a mace icon appearing on your active demon, stunning it for the duration of the summon. If the summon goes through the old demon disappears, otherwise the old demon regains consciousness. I remember being annoyed having to wait for the stun to go away.
---
Was this a later expansion? It can't be from a private server as I've never played warlock on private servers.
---
&gt; In my personal opinion.. people who downplay these things as a non-issue are not real Vanilla WoW lovers, or they are straight up stupid.
---
Ah, good ol' No True Scotsman arguments and proud gatekeeping. 
---
Great display of this sub's maturity. 
---
More dev time is not a thing they are interested in. That is a totally new system that needs developing, testing, bugfixing and who knows how many systems it touches. Loot trading is already in the base game they are working from, it would take effort to remove it, leaving it in is free.
---
What’s population on your server? I’ve never gone more than 5 min without a whisper using LFG as a tank. I usually am questing or pvp’ing while getting a group together. It’s very easy. 
---
They suck dick
---
Agreed. If Blizzard doesn't want to waste GM time the policy should be that soulbound loot will not be moved by a game master under any circumstance.
---
Not a great look. Hey, we have been doing this forever but now because of a tiny number of whiny people and a tiny number of absolute fucktards we have to change policy. In addition to how bad it looks, they would still get fucktons of loot trade tickets since they have always fixed it. Easier to just leave this system in and have people like you filtered out of the server community over time as nobody wants to run with a ninja.
---
Sure, people will unequip their better items for the lenght of entire dungeon runs all the time just to slightly increase a friend's chance of getting an item.
---
That's some next level paranoia. Really shows what you think of the Classic community. 
---
This was before the proc was nerfed
---
Nah just make a premium version. The normal one pops up an ad every time you try to inspect an item.
---
&gt;It's also confusing because the Classic crowd should theoretically be older but you can go to most posts on this sub and see at least one person calling another a fucking idiot or something equally as immature.
---
I have been confused about this myself. I played vanilla wow on private servers and was expecting mid-20 to mid-30 mature playerbase. People were toxic and bigoted and awful to play with. I raided with a guild and every topic outside gameplay was fucking unbearable. 
---
But tips out dont know shit lol
---
Here's why it doesn't matter.
---
LFM Dungeon - Cloth Robe reserved.
---
It is op. Because it is fun. But it is not op.
---
You see?
---
Other guides say Clever Hat or other helms for Shaman pre raid bis. I don’t get it, I thought bis was like, the community has objectively figured out what’s best by now, but from googling around, I can find af least 4 “bis” shaman helms..
---
This might partly be true but he has a brain and is actually using it and that's already a big difference to a lot of people around here. 
---
Looks simple enough. Not sure if you are trying to make money off of it, but if you want to share the data and design files, I could build it as an iPhone app in like a week and then release it for free.
---
Message me.
---
I assume you're going to be playing on a really old computer so you only get 12 frames per second in MC so your gameplay experience is authentic as well, correct?
---
One thing I want is for master looted items, we should have the ability to put them back incase of missclick. 
---
The DPSer is healing.
---
The sense of entitlement in this sub is getting extremely obnoxious. 
---
Boy do I hope the actual Classic community come summer is not like this sub. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/awhzec/here_are_examples_showing_why_loot_trading_is/
---
The whole reserve thing won't work out all the time. Vanilla also was about rolling the dice...
---
Reserving might be a thing for tanks, though. 
---
They have to remove sharding,that's the only thing I care about. It fucking sucks and kills the whole community why the fuck would they want to implement it? 
---
Loot trading is really bad too but sharding should be ''killed'' at first.
---
Why are some complaining about people mentioning bugs to blizzard? Which may or may not be a real bug is upto blizzard to decide and confirm. Both parties want the best for classic, so why bash on them? 
---
Whether or not the time commitment is worth it ia for everyobe to decide individually. Personally I regret every day of playing post classic much more than the 2 years hardcore nerding classic. Everything after that was honestly just trying to recapture that classic feeling in a world where the designers moved further and further away from the systems that made classic classic. 
---
Exept that it is a system that has been in place for a long time. And making it is extreeeemly easy.  
---
Not saying about removing trade loot simply:  
---
If roll=need True  
---
Then loottrade=true, else loottrade=false  
---
I feel like players need to concentrate on what blizzard needs to do to make retail great again instead of bringing back vanilla. 
---
Wouldn’t it be great if we had more reliable servers, better graphics, and they developed the game world/systems using vanilla philosophies? 
---
Why isn’t this what everyone is demanding
---
Did somebody say [Thunder. . . Man, I can't even do it. 
---
&gt;Ah, good ol' No True Scotsman arguments and proud gatekeeping.
---
It's objectively true that loot trading and especially sharding goes directly against the core spirit of Vanilla. You are clearly one of those idiots who read the phrase no true scotsman, and now think you are a 200 IQ person for parroting that phrase anywhere it can remotely apply.
---
"Sharding Elwynn Forest for the first few days is going to KILL THE WHOLE COMMUNITY!!!"
---
I wonder why they aren't communicating much with the Classic pseudo-developer community?
---
It seems like an "undo" button is more appropriate than loot trading doesn't it? Like, if the master looter misclicks, they should just hit undo and get a second chance to click the right player. It doesn't make sense to give the player who incorrectly received the item the ability to decide where it goes.
---
Same with need/greed rolls. If you click need by accident, then you should only be able to give the item to the next highest roller. 
---
Hey think you could draw me and 39 people running in AQ with 9 dragons flying around maybe say 30 or 40 bugs?
---
&lt;random rogue&gt; - LF9M UBRS, dal'rends, true strike reserved. Need key holder!
---
Ok, you dont have the slightest clue how vanilla gearing works, and there's no point taking anything you write seriously.
---
Instead of stage 1,2,3 and så fourth, I AS a noob, would prefer pre-raid, MC, BWl and so on.
---
Yeah, more than just 'best' in slot would be very nice.  For example if you're a fresh 60 there are some boe items you can buy relatively cheaply that may be 3rd or 4th on the list which can help you get into the fight very fast.
---
contrast this quality driven mentality from Nintendo with an unnamed company that I heard just laid off a lot of its' QC staff...
---
anyone got the link to this?
---
&gt;Where every player cares about “bis”.
---
Imagine actually believing players wont care about BIS in Classic.
---
Why is the warrior wearing the Kel'Thuzad healing shield? LMAO
---
&gt; Need key holder
---
UBRS Key Services 10g.  I love it when those groups fall apart after Jed.
---
This is great! Can there be some swap options for each though because no everyone will be able to get a TF. 
---
Nostalgia is a very powerful thing, I also find it painful thinking about times in the past that I'll never get to relive. It's good to indulge yourself sometimes though and relive the parts you can. Whatever is troubling you don't be sad that its in the past, be happy you got the chance to live it. 
---
Cool idea man.
---
Too bad this isn't Vanilla and the private server culture is going to carry over to Classic.  
---
Insults do not substitute arguments ;)
---
You're already proving my point by trying to divide the vanilla fans into "real vanilla fans" (who are of course only those that share your personal opinion) and "not real vanilla fans" (who are those who disagree with you)... so thank you for that I guess. 
---
Sharding and loot trading will NOT be major changes to core gameplay. Sharding won't be because it will be only be there for an extremely limited amount of time, loot trading won't be because loot wasn't final in vanilla anyway (just handled by GMs) and the possible is blown way out of proportion. 
---
Well, people do that an awful lot in retail. The fact that its even possible is enough of a reason to oppose it. The minor convenience isn't worth the risk
---
People place a lot of emphasis on being 100% efficient because of this subreddit. Because of YouTube content creators. Because of streamers like asmongold. They all tell you that your trash and garbage if you aren’t the best most efficient at everything. If you aren’t at the top 1% then you should uninstall and kill yourself. 
---
Don’t act like this isn’t true. Nobody is advocating for playing the game at your own inefficient pace and enjoying your time. It’s best routes, leveling specs, quests that are fast, don’t do quests that take a long time. 
---
Fury was recomend alot due to the bugged nature of sit to crit talents proccing on private servers. This is no longer the case so arms will pull ahead.
---
It stands for Best in Slot. Usually it's used to determine what items you should go for during different parts of the game, so you know you're geared enough for the content.
---
I think it’s time to realize that this sub doesn’t want vanilla wow. They want private server vanilla wow. There’s a difference.

Though luck, and creates a memory which you can laugh at down the line.
---
That is amazing, I stopped playing at the beginning of warlords because I hated the way it was going.  Really it stopped being fun when MOP was released.  Going back to Vanilla is something that will bring me back for sure.  Thank you for the replies, gonna have to follow this sub so I can stay in the loop.  Thank you for the replies.  
---
Protect this wholesome content proud of you
---
Fell asleep shortly after but yes this morning I couldn't have been happier!
---
Definitely. But i'm not sure they will.
---
On undocumented servers sitcritting makes fury work really well.
---
I’m cool with that. I’m just saying nothing about this topic is a deal breaker for me.
---
Don't expect a charitable analysis on a hysterical mess. People unironically say the game is ruined if we can share loot for 30 minutes. It's not authentic, sure, but far from ruined. 
---
I guess they never miss, huh?
---
My world encounter tier list: Hunter &gt; Warlock &gt; Mage &gt; Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Shaman &gt; Warrior &gt; Rogue
---
Just my personal list of classes in order of what I really don't like to encounter as in the world.
---
What could be different enough to really fundamentally matter? It would have to be a thing like "actually it turns out for melee hit rating is better than crit forever" or something. 
---
If classic has numerous differences but they don't affect bis lists or really change up damage, said differences will mainly just be fun trivia. 
---
It’s clear you didn’t play in Vanilla. This has nothing to do with the guild, it has to do with the rest of the server. Once a player (or a guild) steals loot, it becomes known on the server. What others do with that information is up to them, but it absolutely will prevents people from running with them. And it’ll be 100x more apparent today than 15 years ago because of places like Reddit, where victims will flock to tell others what happened.
---
Man I’m in the same boat. Legitimately started running and working out again this past week so when the game comes out I’m in a good routine and keep it up.
---
Logic behind it for me is, if I’m working out while this game takes huge chunks of my life I’ll feel ok with it 😂
---
Good for you!
---
Reckoning is still faster than Ret at the same level, assuming /sit doesn't work to trigger stacks?
---
Do you have data on that? Because mobs only have a 5% crit chance at the same level, so you're losing all the damage talents from Ret in order to gain a 5% chance per mob attack of an extra swing. That doesn't sound remotely worth it to me.
---
Because there exist quite a few people who actually like the modern design philosophy. For a perfect example, go check out the nerd rage going on right now over the announcement that they'll be removing some portals from the game.
---
Of course not, but you need to spec prot to tank a raid — I’m talking about those prot warrs. The ones that raid as fury have no reason to ever go Prot, so why would you assume I was talking about them?
---
Where can I donate to make this happen?
---
it helps people who dont read the forums or reddit
---
Fantastic!
---
Oh, it's not worth it at all if you're going full Ret. Sorry, I misunderstood and still thought we were talking about OPs wishful thinking 1h+Shield Prot/Ret mix.
---
Yeah, full Ret is pretty much the best leveling build there is.
---
What about people needing on items just to sell them to party members
---
&gt; They all tell you that your trash and garbage if you aren’t the best most efficient at everything. If you aren’t at the top 1% then you should uninstall and kill yourself.
---
&gt; Don’t act like this isn’t true. Nobody is advocating for playing the game at your own inefficient pace and enjoying your time. It’s best routes, leveling specs, quests that are fast, don’t do quests that take a long time.
---
It's peoples choice to listen to idiots, isn't it? I certainly stopped listening to these type of players and/or content creators and found myself having much more JOY in the games that I play.
---
Thinking back 30 years it's kind of the same thing as having a Guide-Book to your favorite game and beating the game. Sure, it was fun finding all the hidden gems but it certainly did come nowhere close to figuring out the stuff on your own. The same thing holds true for all sort of games. 
---
So yeah, once again:
---
&gt; Don’t act like this isn’t true.
---
It's only as true as you're making it out to be and that's YOUR choice.
---
I also think classic is going to exceedblizzards expected numbers, for your reasons but also because Blizzard in late 2028 has shown a lot of evidence that they don’t have a great read on their player base.
---
Ahh, that makes more sense.
---
I actually haven't played feral, but I am just bit interested in them. It seems that they have some good aspects to them - like having good TPS, flexibility of tanking, dps and occasional healing, plus apparently leveling is great. As for dps rotation, powershifting can be bit more challenging/engaging, which interest me.
---
Warlock is pretty much what I have always played in WoW, but I feel like experimenting. I am not settled on anything yet, I've been bouncing around with warriors, priests, etc. 
---
But I am probably going to raid with people who aren't really pent on having optimal composition since we already have at least ret with us.
---
cool! can you work in enchantments?
---
&gt; If someone's already subbed to WoW, and happens to jump on classic or not, that won't change their income, so...why bother with spending effort on trackins such a stat?
---
????????
---
To know what their players are playing? Do you think blizzard is just tracking how much money changed from last week on their bank account. 
---
This is the most basic and important thing to track, how many players are playing your games.
---
A druid and a rogue both want a piece of loot. In vanilla, they both had the same chance of getting it as they only had their 1 need roll each.  
---
With loot trading enabled, you get as many need rolls as you have friends in the group. If the druid knew 2 other people in the group, he'd get 3 need rolls to the rogue's 1, as the other 2 people could trade the item to the druid if they won it.
---
just wow lol
---
he didn't even read my comment and tries to make a point lmfao
---
What?
---
It has to be, there's no way they put July and a reference to July 16, 2006 in a panel accidentally.
---
people can run a dungeon for weeks and get unlucky not getting pre raid bis drops. you are kinda clueless?
---
Warcraft 3 still holds up to this day, custom games are made by players again and not by bots!
---
Back in the day before i played wow, i played wc3 and the feeling of actually seeing thrall and walking on durotar was so great.
---
omg you are not a REAL vanilla fan if you don't think it's ruined!!!
---
jk ofc ;)
---
I don't want any of classics loot mechanics to be changed.
---
Do you work in the gaming industry, or are you just making assumptions based on what you hear on the internet?  
---
I'm not trying to be offensive here, I realize the question may sound like that, but I'm seriously just trying to understand where you get this information.
---
you and your alt account are really failing here. to ninja you not only have to be the leader but change it to master loot. 
---
And honestly, which category do you really feel ActiBlizz is falling into?
---
..no words to describe you and the other guys stupidity
---
it's not paranoia it's something that will actually happen, that did not happen back then, that most people do not want.
---
I just hope it's a vocal minority. I don't believe most people will be like this in game. At least that is what I hope. Also seeing that downvoted  comments in this thread mostly aligning with how I think, makes me think that just because some people are out of line, most people don't agree with them.
---
Resto is not better for healing dungeons than enhance or Elly. 
---
exactly and in retail it's trivial because you replace the item very quick. in classic you can be using a pre raid bis item for weeks or months
---
Did the devs actually say this was going to be in the game or is this just ranting?
---
This would be nice, and the UX/UI is already designed in retail with gear swapping in slots, so could just rip that off.
---
How do you think blizzard will know if classic is succsesfull or not? 
---
You don't be an expert to know that it's important to know what game your players are playing. 
---
Yes yes. It’s all terrible and doom and gloom. 
---
You clearly will have to go back to a private server to get an authentic experience. 
---
/s
---
how does this comment even make sense? people want a private server type wow because they want the game to be how it was back then? what exactly does that have to do with a private server. people are comparing this latest beta, to classic wow as it was then. 
---
They should build in all the extra server downtime that we experienced too. Oh and all the lag spikes that would randomly occur, and only let us play on DSL. No fast internet connections.
---
And you know damn well it's not single player. 
---
Ion said it as Blizzcon under the justification that it wouldn't change anything but that isn't true.
---
I feel like you're not familiar with the term Best In Slot.
---
If it's made to not work on need, only greed and loot master, I think it would not be a big issue. But if it works on need, I think that is a very large problem.
---
Even when it is on loot master it might be a problem, because people will be trying to buy it off whoever wins, but then the community will need to decide how they treat that kind of behaviour.
---
Not entirely. It’s pressure. The internet now isn’t not the same as guide books, looking at you Prima!  This all happens on a subconscious level. It’s proven that if you say a lie enough it becomes the truth in people’s minds. 
---
So while I want to agree with your argument, it’s just not true. People will always strive towards being like the power elite and they usually don’t realize it. 
---
In real life the power elite are obvious, celebrities, ceo’s, wealthy people. In gaming it’s different. It’s balding Gollum look-a-like on twitch named asmongold. 
---
Not to mention the mmorpg emphasis on competition in general. It’s simply not enough to be a rogue, you have to be better than the other rogues because you compete for that guild invite, raid spot, epeen. 
---
So what happens if you don't equip the item until you leave the dungeon?  And don't say check the armory because what if they ran it again and it happened to drop ?  It is a very messy situation overall.  I don't know what is best.  I just hope they make the right choice!
---
Sit crit was in the original game for the longest time btw, it might still be in the game actually i dont remember 
---
Exactly. Why do Blizzard even care? Just make a god damn rule that says: "We won't restore or fix any loot for anyone" and leave it at that. There will always be people complaining but that will be a whiny minority.
---
If they really need loot trading for something then use it for vendors, so if you buy the wrong item you can just sell it again and buy the correct one. I know this happened A LOT before loot trading was introduced, I think I wrote like 3 tickets myself back in the days.. the GM's were so busy that they usually ended up giving you an extra item OR forgetting to delete the old item, this obviously got abused when the word spread and was probably the reason for loot trading to begin with.
---
Either way, leave raids/dungeons alone for pure anarchy and introduce loot trading for vendors if it's absolutely necessary since that's much more forgivable than having loot trading for raids or dungeons. Easy done
---
Its early game fury and late game arms as far as i can tell, all of the arms talents are weak compared to fury when your gear is bad.
---
But the point is not whether it is the end of the world or not. It's : Don't implement loot trading, at all, no GM tickets. Very easy to do from Blizzard, and it will be better. Logical.
---
Well, given that official classic servers don't exist I'd say, everything.
---
:( wow people hate Shadow Priests
---
&gt;half way
---
It's because I usually try to be forgiving as a tank as much as I can, but if there is pre hot/pre cast spells/broken CC every pull imma start saying shit. It's usually halfway through it gets too much.
---
&gt;Of all the tanking classes Druids undeniably have the best AoE threat generation
---
Eh no. Druids are bottom of the barrel on aoe tanking. Please dont spread misinformation like this.
---
I'm really hoping that also means the quest log won't be limited to just 20 quests any more. Does anyone know how that was on the demo?
---
Because blizzard is saying/going to say that the communities understanding and expectation of what vanilla wow actually was is not the same as on private servers. Since people only have recent knowledge of private server vanilla wow they will realize they aren’t longing for actual vanilla wow. They are longing for (what they came to know) as private server vanilla wow that isn’t illegal. 
---
I’d go rogue. Stealth was god mode in those days.
---
Did he say its going to be inplemented or was it just the demo thing because theyre running it on the retail client?
---
Because if theyre convinced this should be in the game its going to destroy classic pretty quickly. Especially when they get away with it and changes like that start spiraling out of control which happened with the og game to begin with
---
I must be the only one who plays WoW with friends
---
This is fantastic. Great job 
---
Because a decent amount of private servers players like to show how much more they know about the game than "everyone else". And people like shutting them up a bit every once in a while. Even other private server players can be annoyed by them btw. 
---
Exactly a post I'd expect from someone named Blake.
---
Wow that's very well-made and user-friendly ! Congratz !
---
Sure, and you have to go to the store and talk to someone, they have to approve it, etc. Stores dont say "we'll just let you walk in and do you own exchange by yourself".
---
Yea, people make mistakes. That doesn't mean the system should be changed. You can still contact a GM (just like you can contact the storr employees) about it.
---
Fuck private servers I'm not talking about them were talking about the differences in the actual game back then and their latest build
---
If the group invites you to the dungeon as DPS, you are entitled to roll on any loot that is an upgrade for your DPS such as HoJ. I dont know why this should have to be debated.
---
Less chat rules.
---
More like what will official servers do better once Classic releases?
---
I'd say SERVERS, for surely. They won't have stupid sharding, nor loot trading and the report BS.
---
This is a mess \[+1\]
---
Here is why:
---
1. There is plenty of wands before level 48. You can update literally every 4 levels. 100%. you just need to know the quests and vendor prices.
---
2. Recommending 19 wand from BFD (Gravestone scepter) is a fucking joke, last boss of BFD is level 26, so its doubtful that you would be able to get this wand on lvl 19, especially on a fresh server. 
---
3. Improved swp after wand spec? you know that improved SWP is a t2 talent, right? It requires 5/5 spirit tap first
---
4. Moreover imrpoved swp cap is 2 talents. 2/2 not 2/3
---
5. Rotation is wrong. You should be using 5-second-rule as much as possible. So smite in your first rotation is a big problem, since it is 2.5sec cast and actually interrupts your regen for like 7.5 seconds total. Very-very-very bad. Every priest should go with this: Holy Fire -&gt; MB -&gt; SWP -&gt; Shield -&gt; Wand , or if you have improved swp: HF -&gt; SWP -&gt; MB -&gt; Shield -&gt; Wand.
---
6. Second rotation is also wrong, since renew is more mana effecient than shield. When low on mana you should stick with MB -&gt; SWP -&gt; Renew -&gt; Wand or even skip renew, if too low. Moreover instant spells like shield or renew should be cast last in your sequence to fully capitalize on a 5-second-rule.
---
That's totally fine, I get that. But Classic (to some degree) is about the community, and your character being a part of the world. If its not healthy for that aspect (and I dont think entirely free re-specs are), then we shouldnt advocate for those things, regardless of how one feels about it individually 
---
I watch a ton of gaming news and have been gaming for a good while. I also deal with "corporate" a ton at my job and understand their language. Only someone who doesn't understand corporations or a fresh gaming "sheep" will see this as good news. 
---
It's actually going to be in the game, unfortunately. Ever since Diablo 3 (maybe before?), Blizzard has demonstrated a real lack of ability to predict how game systems will negatively impact player behavior. This looks like another one of those scenarios. 
---
Go full Enhance to level 40 then spec Ele with the rest of your talents to 60 for optimal killing speeds. Just like tanks, healers doesn't need to be specced in their main spec to heal low level dungeons, you can easily heal dungeons as any other specc. Just make sure to loot some int gear on your way up to the mid level range dungeons.
---
This is the specc I usually go with [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uh0hZxVfzV0ut](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uh0hZxVfzV0ut)
---
You can change improved lightning shield to Anticipation or Enhancing/Guardian totems aswell depending on your playstyle. I don't have a problem remembering keeping lightning shield up like many shamans do so I usually go with that.
---
Well it looks like this sub is filled with Blizzard fanboys and apologists now. Rip the days when it was just us passionate vanilla fans and private server players. Let the showing of downvotes continue. Classic will likely not be as good as a some pservers were.
---
Man like i cant believe it. I must see it for myself like this just seems so unbelievably stupid.
---
Lol, sounds about right.
---
if you're not a company, iOS apps are horrible to make, and it costs a lot just to put it out there. android is ez pz tho
---
But I did play Vanilla and dicks did often get away with it because most people genuinely don't care if someones a dick/ninja looter. If anything they'll just make sure there's nothing he can steal in that run and go with him anyway.
---
Same but people are people.
---
Hey guys, just thought to share 2 methods of making some extra gold during the release of classic wow.  
---
One can be done semi-afk and one just for fun :)  
---
Hope you like it.
---
Love this already! Good work
---
1. No, from 19-30 there are very little good wand upgrades and most wands on the AH are level 30 wands for 10-30g each. 
---
2. You can easily heal BFD at 19. It's easy. I literally did it myself at 
---
3. The implication is you would get t1 to get swp. but i did state spirit tap. 
---
4. Renew is more mana efficient but shield is safer. 
---
Blizz is changing the system by removing gms. I don’t agree with that, noone does. They used to be the needed failsafes for e.g. Thunderfury bindings. Very big problem if they get assigned wrong for some reason, stupid click mistake or whatever it may be. We very much need some alternatives.
---
Pretty pointless question because everyone knows they aren’t doing it to make art so they should care about what people enjoy or don’t enjoy about the product. But obviously they have been in full on money mode for at least the past 10 years
---
More true of a gameplay experience. Remember... theyre rebuilding classic wow. and all systems. p servers run a basic client of it so the nature of the game is likely more true
---
I'm pretty sure a good amount of the "bad" changes introduced in BfA (and some in Legion too) are because the devs are starting to look back at older versions of the game and what made them successful, then trying to apply that to the modern game somehow (and failing, pretty much). But it definitely feels like the devs are actually mostly doing their own thing now, and are not just doing exactly what the players want, which contrary to most people I think is a good thing. They are not just going for more of everything (which is pretty much what the community wants), they are trying to find a balance of what works well, which means removing some things (causing an uproar from many players). 
---
I'm actually a little bit optimistic, maybe not for the future of BfA, but it's not impossible that the next expansion will have a lot of really cool stuff. Not setting my hopes that high though. 
---
You can easily heal BFD at 19 as a priest. 
---
You do sound a bit like like a rogue...hmm. Not a word about tanking or pocket healers in what you wrote.
---
Rogue is great for avoiding ganks, doing some ganking, and making money via professions or pick pocketing.
---
Also being able to pick pocket open most doors and chests is a pretty nice boon, too.
---
I'd only heal a premade. Very few random BG players are worth healing, and a lot of the time they will do nothing to help you.
---
Well, no, that's incorrect. 
---
dang it! im surprised theres no warlocks angrily posting that thunderfury is bad because it competes for debuffs with corruption
---
In 1.12
---
Warriors are the best dps;
---
Warriors are the best tanks;
---
Warriors are the best in PVP (with support);
---
Warrior is simply the best class in vanilla wow.
---
Of course, if You like to gank people from stealth and get away with it then roll a rogue.
---
Implement alternatives and I will buy this app for a dollar ;) 
---
This is why vanilla is great
---
I like it! 
---
Could you:
---
-rename stages to describing terms? Say”Pre-Raid, MC,BWL”
---
-show second tier items in case the bis ones are too difficult or time heavy to acquire? 
---
-allow users to create a list, share, and rate it?

If it makes you feel better, I still gets asked for portals all the time as a mage afking in Boralus. 
---
I'd prefer it that way massively also. Hopefully they'll listen to us.
---
Asking for money would be a great way to get sued by Blizzard. Its better asking for donations instead.
---
Dis good
---
Why?
---
Not sure I understand you. You do know you couldn't fly in the newest expansions, right? That's what "Pathfinder" is, it's only unlockable at the end of an expansion allowing you to fly on that continent if you have fullfilled all the requirements (ie. played through the whole expansion). 
---
Thats absurd lol 
---
Just have loot be final this also saves the same amount of money without destabilizing the community.
---
Arguably better than warriors if they know what they are doing.
---
Higher initial threat on pull due to being able to pull with Starfire/Wrath/Moonfire, Innervate for the healer, much higher HP pool and armor that means the healer have a longer time to respond to any spikes in damage and considerably higher threat than a Warrior on any pack that has 4-5 mobs or less.
---
24/7 population
---
Priest is great in pve (assuming you're healing, shadow is awkward but guilds can take one) one of the most versatile healers and you can get Benediction to look ultra pimp.
---
For alliance races dwarf is the obvious choice because of fear ward, it's not necessary but is extremely convenient and could tip the scales in your favor.
---
12 yo with no arguments pretending to have  a serious conversation.
---
&gt;In vanilla bear tanks were not very good until they fixed their armor though right?
---
That was like patch 1.2. 
---
Thsnk you. This will help a lot this summer. I mainly PvP so I didn't know much about this side of the game back then. Gonna try and have a different experience this time around.
---
W3 has barely anything to do with Classic. Its more connected to TBC and WotLK, obviously. 
---
Almost nobody will care unless the one griefed is from a major guild or if you ninja alot. When i see someone calling out a ninja in world, usually nobody care (and sometimes it's a made up story anyway).
---
There is a reason wotlk private server all ban ninja (and its the only expansion with maybe cata where it happen), literally because how bad it is with loot trading.
---
He would be sued out of the app stores in no time. Its better to ask for donations instead.
---
Walking into an Orc watchtower and a human barracks the first time in WoW was a religious experience because of WC3.
---
This is a great app!  The only thing I suggest (as a mage) is to consider the list of bis holistically.  For example, I've seen mage bis lists with 0% hit rating from gear.  This would never realistically happen, since we need to get as close to the 16% cap as possible (10% of which must come from gear.)
---
So, a true bis list would contain whatever combination of gear gets you as close to 10% as possible with the least amount of sacrifice to the other important stats.
---
Amazing work so far! Thank you for sharing this with us, I would most definitely use this.
---
Yes. I’d categorize your complaints like that. 12 year old with no real arguments, trying to be angry, REEEEEEEEEEing all over the place, pretending they deserve to be taken seriously. 
---
disclosure: played shaman on feenix 1, which had raid bosses with several times more HP than normal and most naxx bosses having WOTLK damage values
---
i firmly believe bear tanks are better - even at 60
---
theyre so much easier to heal with their ridiculous armor/hp pools that crits/crushes dont feel much different from normal hits. dps rarely has to wait to start dpsing or worry about pulling threat because bears do so much more single target and aoe. the latter point is tremendously valuable to horde raiding since melee get amped up by windfury and casters have -20% threat compared to -30%
---
I wouldn't mind a third one as well... Sometimes the bis stuff is insanely hard to get.
---
&gt;If you want Blizzard to know why you are subbing, wait it out.
---
Blizzard has insight in the active player count. They will see why people are paying for a sub. 
---
Also, why dont you let people decide on their own why they are subbing and why not? 
---
If you are into raiding and m+ and have an active guild, retail is insanely fun. 
---
Thanks!
---
Private servers are like a time machine. 
---
Classic will be more of a recreation of Vanilla. 
---
When was the GM thing announced?
---
Haha yh. I mostly play solo so I guess Rogue is tge better way to go. But, I enjoy being this big guy that hits hard. Also plate is so cool!
---
Yes, the restrictions and time gating on flying after reaching max level in recent expansions are absurd and make playing the game shitty and tedious.
---
still no arguments, going for ad hominem because you cant figure out how the debate is actually taking place.
---
You can/should spec fury if you're not one of the main tanks. I think in higher gear you could do some fury/prot spec even as a main tank that actually works better, depending on how you look at it. Protection is good for protection. But tanking is not only about surviving, it's also about holding aggro, and outside of a few talents the prot tree doesn't help with that. 
---
Or in other vernacular, arugula.
---
Thanks! I guess Rogue would be the better choice as I mostly play solo.
---
Maybe its just the nostalgia that is leaning me towards warrior and the cool looks of plate of course
---
not really. aoe tanking for warriors is so bad that if you want to play the game in a raiding context you almost have no choice but to go engineering to get the lightning shield. worse yet, they break so quickly that you generally need to keep five in your bags so that you dont have to repair every few pulls
---
thunder clap is massively inefficient, takes more than 1 gcd to devote to, and has a cooldown of its own
---
cleave only hits one other enemy but doesnt provide as much threat as a normal tanking ability
---
demoralizing shout is, while it hits everything, incredibly weak and your party generally has to wait ages before you have established threat on every target
---
you do get an aoe taunt, but its on a 10 minute cooldown
---
The bis shield for Wars is wrong, the shield you posted is a healing shield, not the tanking one.
---
Yeah, you're right.  The very negative ones were positive at the time I made my comment but they're negative now so there's hope after all!
---
No, I didn't. That is the 19 wand. 
---
I'm second guessing whether it's in the game right now but it was always a thing as long as I can remember. You used to see rogues one-shotting drinking clothies and stuff.
---
Druids are close exception. Overall armor will reduce incoming damage. It still won't change me getting salty over losing cloth rolls as a priest. At least I'll get over it at 60 and I plan on doing shaman as main so w/e.   
---
That is, an enhance shaman who will wear his appropriate armor class UNLESS the cloths in my dungeon don't need/already have that sfk belt.
---
Do you know what sub you are in? lol
---
Ramsey: It’s Raw!!
---
But you have to respec for that. 50 g hurts a lot. 
---
That’s actually not what I’m talking about. Thanks for commenting 
---
You’re right, but I get where they are coming from. They want the viable alternatives listed as well as they work towards BiS gear, but it might be best adding that to a sidebar or something to avoid cluttering. 
---
Maybe a list of popular alternate items for each slot down below or something that you can read through, stats in the right for quick viewing, and add a hover option over the linked name for a full description. 
---
OPs site is already super great looking so far, I would rather something like that added later on once they’ve completed what they set out to do. They already have my future traffic when classic is released!
---
Well. Yes. You can’t take the effort to punctuate your sentence properly. So you’re not worth my time. 
---
As is, literally everything you’re complaining about is a “hot topic” here that has been discussed to death. I’m completely tired of arguing those points with people like you. People that are so unhinged emotionally about these points that they’re raging and illogical. 
---
So I’m just not going to.
---
Enjoy frothing at the mouth over nothing. 
---
I just wanted to reflect on your previous comment that's all. Thank you.
---
I kinda like MadSeason, but I don't think there's anything special about a lot of his content. A lot of the info that he uses has been laying around online for forever. That's all. I'm not a hater, but just surprised he's got as big a channel as he does.
---
Very cool. My two concerns are important though. First, I pray that they don't actually do the 4 stages they announced. It changes so much if you're getting ZG and BWL gear at the same time. That's just an example of what I mean, we really don't know what items will be in or out at any given time, what level of progressive itemization they do. I don't know how much info we will get before launch, maybe, hopefully a beta. Second, there's usefulness from the spreadsheets because it will give you more of a top 10 ranking of items in that slot. So you can see there's a really good lower level quest item that can hold that slot while you weigh your options of what to target.
---
So in conclusion, really cool, simple, good looking app. It has some limitations that will keep more hardcore people going too the spreadsheets.
---
Lol I might try this since INFINITE time now
---
Why would they be sued for this? There are plenty of guides that exist on app stores, not to mention guides from magazines like prima games have existed for decades. 
---
Yeah, if you could do this, it would make this already great idea a phenomenal one. Maybe I might be hoping for too much, but maybe even show like a top 3, or top 5 choices on the right with just text and no icons?
---
I don't know how much work it would take, but if you could maybe also somehow show which boss and which raid to acquire each epic piece, I would be totally willing to pay money for this app. 
---
I'm talking purely later expansions. It's different in Azeroth. Once they added flying taking it away is pure pandering to misguided anti-flying whiners.
---
Classic without flying is a good game. WoD/Legion/BfA aren't.
---
Yeah, I noticed that too. I was looking through the comments for an explanation like maybe it had an obnoxious amount of armor or something. 
---
Play the race you want. Dwarf gets insta raid invites because fear ward. I have a gut feeling there will be a lot of dorf priests this go around. Play the race you want. I’d go nelf because I don’t like dwarves. The shadowmeld is an invaluable tool while leveling/grinding and you need to afk.
---
Priests are good healers. 
---
It does have the most armor but the KT shield only has 200 armor less but gains block value which makes it overall better.
---
Your 33 wand does the same DPS at gravestone, nice try though. 
---
You weren’t rude at all.
---
Combat Swords Rogue was a blast to play in Vanilla. Great in PvE. If you want to seriously PvP you may have to respec to Hemo Swords. 
---
10 hunters is mechanically impossible to defeat. ive been there, ive done it, and its absolutely unfair
---
its so imbalanced that we, a group of hunter alts and random "just hit 60 players" ended up queueing against the horde premade. i dont mean a ranking premade, i mean a premade of ex-r14 magic dust abusing, rocket helm humping, terrain abusing players who only logged on once every two weeks for a half hour to shut down wsg. they were amazing players that i still respect
---
in short, they struggled for two hours and the game was 0-0 the entire time. we all agreed to /afk at the same time upon the 2 hour mark. realistically speaking, a group of &lt;t1 geared hunters on average cannot compete with a dream composition with a resto bear flaunting way over 10k hp with 9 other literal full BIS players (well, not KT gear anyway since KT wasnt released then)
---
in short, we were objectively untouchable. 10 viper stings means we could just keep their healers out of mana forever. 10 ice block traps scattered around meant we were unapproachable and could not be engaged. it is not possible to survive 8-10 simultaneous multishots/aimed shots. even if we were, we could viper sting whatever ate the blocks and discount their existence entirely. there is no flag carrier that can run from two hunters, let alone ten. melee cannot engage. warriors will be instantly killed by multishots from every angle during their charge. rogues cannot open due to the sheer flare coverage and scatter shots. warlocks invariably kill themselves with life tap after being stung. mages try to use rank 1 abilities to provide utility, but it ends up being ineffective because theres no damage to back it up. healers cant cast with no mana and having ten pets zerg them killing them within seconds
---
we were in preraid bis/t1. imagine how much more unfair this would have been with t2 and chromaggus bows...
---
Lol. Alliance. Undead is the way to go.
---
We know and I have never seen anyone make that claim.
---
I agree with the options for the tool to show 2nd or 3rd BiS gear and renaming the stages to be more specific. Stage 1 = pre-raid BiS etc. 
---
Looks great though, would be super useful! Hate the spreadsheets as well.
---
wow thats crazy
---
But you're wrong
---
We are getting Classic thanks to Private Servers though and especially thanks to Nostalrius.
---
&gt; But you're wrong
---
ah man my bad 
---
Well op did specify alliance.
---
The artwork is Blizzard property? Same way the private servers got shut down, even if they did not ask for money.
---
&gt; We are getting Classic thanks to Private Servers though and especially thanks to Nostalrius.
---
Not saying that's not the case, defo helped obviously. I'm just saying people who has played on private servers for a couple of years now shouldn't take what they have been playing on as fact. Nostalrius did a great job, but what they did was as I said, just a guess. 
---
I'm hoping private server folks are going to be a small minority to be honest
---
Lol dude, you're looking way to deep into this. It's really not a bid deal to make this change. Also, I never said I was going to ninja loot. What I meant was that If I was in a dungeon with 3 other friends and 1 random, my friends would also roll need on Items that I needed and vice versa to insure one of us got the upgrade over the random. Not really a ninja, because I still needed the item as an upgrade :)
---
If loot trading is part of the game, things like this will happen all the time, and you're just naive if you think it won't.
---
I feel private servers are more like vanilla even if they have wrong droprates and mob values than classic with bfa/legion engine, sharding and battle.net stuff (cash shop, cross faction whispers, mass report)
---
But we dont know how classic is gonna be yet so idk why you are defending blizzard and attacking private servers already.
---
Try it with cod instead of tilapia! 
---
thats really nice
---
I had a twink rogue that i played as assa/sub
---
Is it possible to go all the way to shadowform and still being able to heal in dungeons or possibly raids?
---
Which is "better" profession, tailoring and enchanting or herb and alc?
---
&gt; I feel private servers are more like vanilla even if they have wrong droprates and mob values than classic with bfa/legion engine, sharding and battle.net stuff (cash shop, cross faction whispers, mass report)
---
&gt; But we dont know how classic is gonna be yet so idk why you are defending blizzard and attacking private servers already.
---
Not attacking private servers man. I played on multiple servers and have 60's rn on ND. I'm just saying dont take what they have as facts
---
Wow this is good!!!! Will there be support for BiS thinks in separate brackets (examples: 19 rogue, 29 hunter, 39 mage, 49 shaman, and so on). 
---
I would donate to this kind of development, tell me where to pour my money.
---
Cool story, glad you have justified ninja looting for yourself.
---
INCREDIBLE
---
the sad part is that his bullshit is also upvoted, while he clearly isn't able to understand the situation.
---
Not a problem at all - We can make Classic be like "ps vanilla" with our feedback. :)
---
i did the testing on Holy vs Disc leveling 30 minutes of pure grinding: Holy did more dps because of reduced cast time and increased holy damage, but disc was faster overall because of meditation mana regen.
---
enslin
---
This is very very cool.
---
Can I ask what you're using for it?
---
Glad you know better than blizz developers how their backend works. Maybe you should send this right to them. Or perhaps things are less simple than you think and your idea is a terrible one that is unnecessary. 
---
Short answer is : nothing.
---
Long answer...well, that depends. If Classic will have loot trading, right-click reporting, permanent sharding, the 4 content stages they announced at Blizzcon, and other QoL we don't know, I'd say that private servers will do everything better.
---
The best thing about TBC was Rated Arena. Please give us rated Arena. All I ask 
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Theres one comment on the topic that I often see, that drives me insane. It goes like this...
---
\*Classic forums: It's all about the community man!\*
---
\*Also Classic forums: Everybody is an asshole who will betray you at the first chance.\*
---
...I see that alot, and it makes zero sense. The classic community is great \*because\* of the game's features, or lack thereof. If they introduced LFG-finder, it would obviously damage the community. If they put in permanent sharding, it would obviously damage the community.
---
It's not like everybody drawn to Classic is a saint with a pure heart of gold. No, it's just full of regular people. The community isn't great because it's holier than thou, but because the game \*forces\* a community to develop. Tools like LFG, flying, and \*yes\*, Loot trading are all quality of life features that \*undermine\* the point of the game. 
---
I do dungeons... alot... I tank, heal, DPS, group lead, and it's a rewarding experience. I can easily foresee Loot Trading poisoning many otherwise excellent runs. People invest time into doing a dungeon, and when the desirable piece of loot drops, everybody is in suspicion and high-alert mode. Instead of an honest "grats on that Ravager", theres an ill feeling that maybe the Warrior tank secretly has a WW axe rather than the green he linked, and is going to trade it to the Pally healer.
---
I really want to hear a counter to all of this, and why it is \*necessary\* to implement this hazardous and foreign feature. I have no illusions either, that Blizzard will read every post, but I can hope, too.
---
Hey! Great work!
---
 Would it possible at all to make one for pvp twink brackets aswell´?
---
I tried weaving autoattacks between wands. Its pure awesome +25% dps boost if done properly.
---
* Ideally you need slow staff with more than 3sec swing time.
---
* Damage of staff should be x1.5 of your wand. If staff dmg is less than x1.5 of wand dmg, its becomes useless.
---
* What you do is strike a melee attack after 2 wand shoots. and then press wand autoattack again as soon as possible.
---
* Rule of thumb here: if your staff is slower than 3sec and withing a 4 lvl gap from your wand - you should melee weave.
---
**By Enslin**
---
Why would't you paying attention?
---
ANY reason you can come up with points to a player that should never master looter.
---
If one guy out of 1000 makes a mistake once in a blue moon...that is not a viable reason to implement a system that will negatively impact the game.
---
i work in IT so i have a vague idea on hownit easy to make a click command popup.
---
i just think you are wrong and wont admit that it is a goos idea
---
I was being sarcastic.
---
&gt; All in all I'd say mobs across vanilla servers do on average 25%  
---
Do you think we are all stupid or something? If you are going to try and portray private servers as incorrect, at least pick realistic examples.
---
So I'll have to ask you to provide some sources for this insane claim.
---
The only thing I can say is this:
---
Where can I throw money at you to complete this.
---
Hey man, that looks awesome, only thing I'd miss from the Excel sheets is the extra gear options. So showing alternative pieces of your can't get your hands on the optimal one. Showing stuff like healing points etc relevant to the class would also be cool. I'm on my phone now so I don't have access to the link to a nice druid sheet you could have as inspiration. 
---
So loot trading is a pathetic excuse?
---
All right man, go back to BFA.
---
I mean.. id still argue that my experience on recent P/S and has atleast tried to make it authentic as possible, for people with passion in there hearts and only the wayback machine  to figure out values i felt like i had a pretty blizzard like experience. They did progessive itemization (tbh im extremely concerned that blizzard hasnt talked about it at this point) progressive proper patches. (There is something magical about world boss opening day) 
---
Tldr: pservers might be more blizz like then blizzard
---
Yes. Almost all the way to 60, but it might get a bit overwhelming in the mid 50’s.
---
You are quite a prick. 
---
World drop BoE gear could always drop. But even if what you said was right, what’s wrong with that? The community as a whole creates the punishment. It works fine.
---
And you 100% didn’t play Vanilla. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.
---
100% accurate, actually.
---
He is just spewing bs, ignore this retarded OP
---
You get people from around different regions.
---
I think that's about it. There's a lot of negatives, such as world chat (in my opinion, herrderr), as well as the unreliability of a lot of the dev teams.
---
At least I know, when classic comes out, it's going to be there for a while. I'm not going to go to the battle net website, telling me and thousands of others, "lol woops soz".
---
If I’m doubt go warrior.  Leave the rogue-ing to us.  
---
I think there's a good chance this might be true. The will be a lot of curious casuals and maybe they stay for longer. 
---
You should definatly avoid hopping on the first servers that are coming up. They will be crowded with p server folks and try hards. 
---
Because it's an ineffective punishment, you ninja loot a bunch of items and then what's your punishment? On a rare occurrence a group might make sure you can't ninja loot another item? That's not a punishment at all.  
---
People will avoid people more based on how bad a player they are than based on whether or not they're a ninja looter/dick.
---
Not sure what relics I mean. To my memory that term was not relevant in classic 
---
I think it's wrong to say that Private servers  *always* err on the side of being easier. There's always bugs and game elements that don't work 100% right that make it *harder*. 
---
I think most people agree that private servers are not 100% representative of Vanilla. But I think people are wrong to argue that the game will be *noticeably* different. Most raids will still be demolished by the powerhouse guilds. Leveling will take the same amount of time, with a 5-10% margin of error. After it releases, we will know for sure how off most private servers are in their estimates.
---
We don't know how Classic will deliver yet. Maybe the server infrastructure is shit, and sharding will be used for *more than a week* on starting zones -or- on launch week they may have to shard Westfall and the Barrens. They may let loot trading and right click reporting fly into the game. 
---
Nobody has any illusions that Private Servers are off to some degree. But there is a little bit of the game that is lost when modern features make it in, and with every addition, the private server becomes more and more Vanilla-like than Classic.
---
your gravestone scepter requires darnassus visit to start the quest, then travel to ashenvale and a 2h+ dungeon run. Sums up in at least 3 hours of playing. Not worth it, if you are speed leveling.
---
I honestly think it will be more common with vanilla retail players who remember things wrong.
---
The ranged slot for pallies/druids/shamans. 
---
If there are still people that don't understand why loot trading should never be in Classic, after your examples...well, I guess in 6-12 months after release, the Classic "community" will be, in the vast majority, formed from non-Vanilla players.
---
As such, they will be more "open" to stuff like LFD and LFR.
---
And since they will be the majority...
---
Your post tells me the OP has a point. Hope I don't meet trash like you on my vanilla experience. 
---
&gt;But we dont know how classic is gonna be yet so idk why you are defending blizzard and attacking private servers already.
---
Why not turn it around and ask yourself that ? The game isn't out yet but you're already three stages deep into the "Activision Conspiracy". 
---
Cash shop in Classic ? You have to be a special kind of person to believe the design team is so out of touch with their demographic to propose this. Even more so now that Blizzard has acknowledged multiple times that even the tiniest details are important to them. 
---
Private servers are the only thing we have that's close to real vanilla so ofc it's more like vanilla then... let's say... bfa?
---
Since classic is coming out in summer, I'm sure that all important decisions have already been made. At this point it's all about waiting and seeing what they will come up with.
---
Seeing how there were no news of beta till now, I also assume that there will be no beta at all. After all, even if beta were to come out right now and players would compile another list of issues, there is no way that Blizz would be able to fix those issues until release.
---
As for most important issues such as sharding. Since we didn't get any updates on this, it's most likely that sharding is in.
---
If Blizz were decided to remove sharding then they would probably told us but since they didn't, it's most likely that sharding is in... after all, rather than bringing news that would cause hate and rage on the forums, it's better to stay silent instead. (especially since, everyone already made clear stance on sharding after the demo)
---
But isnt grouping for questing super bad due to the heavy exp penalty ? 
---
That can easily be done with a second pop-up window, that asks the Master looter : "Are you sure you want to give X item to Y player? Yes / No.
---
No need for a system for ALL LOOT.
---
We don't know yet
---
I think that you get crit while sitting is intendend . Probably just not the abusing of it infight / inbetween mob swings
---
It's one of the more decent levellers. Well, I guess arguably warriors, paladins and rogues are all decent, but they probably aren't the best for people who are used to more forgiving games, in my opinion.
---
I mean because they can do very good damage with wands, in order to save mana and instead use it to heal themselves. Making them very efficient.
---
I've started playing one on a pserver just the day before yesterday, and it's so much nicer than being a warrior, in the starting zone. 
---
I managed to grab a wand for cheap from the auction house, (which just reminded me how awesome this game is, there's a living breathing community), and ever since I've started using it, it's been a fun change from my warrior, rogue and hunter or paladin levelling experience.
---
They're most definitely going to be the minority, otherwise Classic is a complete failure.  But they're also the ones who will be the ones who are going to be facilitating the first pugs and their influence is going to spread from there.
---
Man, this is a GEM !
---
Props !
---
It was either in Cata or late Wrath. It's a pretty slow way to level though.
---
Yeah, everybody listen to the boomer that posts on Reddit all day guys and STOP discussing the game! 
---
yeah, idk. i agree with ya but the post at 0 karma seems to say people really really really do care what i see on my screen.
---
Rogue is A LOT rougher than hunter in classic.
---
Two COMPLETELY different lifestyles. If stealth is your biggest draw, then I'd recommend druid, and especially if you are a "lone wolf pvper". You also say you leveled a rogue and how it was harder than a hunter, but not in vanilla, so ramp that disparity up by like 11.
---
It's literally the difference between the best leveling class to the worst.
---
Yeah I know and that would be a very useful list, but its totally different from BiS. I would prefer just having a gearing list because with drop rates and expensive BoE world drops i think BiS is too niche/ difficult for me to obtain.
---
&gt;Retail vanilla was way harder, it took longer
---
We don't know that for sure, yet. It's been far too long.
---
I made easy cash by making a Druid and buying the runes arcanite rod recipe from moo glade. It’s needed for enchanting but only the one vendor sells it. It’s a pain to get their as any class other than Druid and sells for a reasonable amount in a few minutes usually. 
---
Alright ... thank you very much ... ill def try that out. 
---
and yet again, and again, nowhere did i say it was "easy", or a "small code change" or anything of the like.
---
It's a wish. a fantasy. y'all need to fukin chill it's not like we've got anything better to discuss.
---
god forbid we took time away from the lootsharing fearmongering going on. 
---
Flip a coin. You will know which one you want to play when it’s midair. Pick that one.
---
I cancelled my sub and gave the reason that I am waiting for classic and won't resub until its out.
---
Thanks for this detailed answer!
---
So for example, if I were a lvl 60 warrior and I wanted to say run The Stockade, I would have to right click every mob and there's no real way to gather them all up and kill them with any aoe abilities?
---
I never knew the connection until recently, its incredible 
---
There will be fewer rogues
---
Arms is vastly superior, for leveling, especially for anyone who wants to roll a Warrior on a PvP server.
---
It is also better suited for tanking 5 men during leveling.
---
Fair, but its the architecture and buildings used imo. Razer hill is a small lvl1 wc3 settlement  
---
&gt; Don't forget the definitive content release plan
---
You mean the content release plan they said they were currently thinking of as of Blizzcon but were looking for feedback on? How is that definitive? Your use of the word definitive almost makes me think you're being sarcastic? Or is that wishful thinking
---
rend it and move on ? :D
---
Oh really ? I didnt know. Thats actually interesting ... i wonder how many other things this affects
---
Just going to voice my 100% agreement in case anyone at Blizz is watching. Soulbound means soulbound
---
If they still exist there were some gearing guides. Maybe OP could incorporate that in somewhere, but I feel like the tiered list is basically that already. You start off getting the stuff for tier one which allows you to do the things for tier two, etc. 
---
Unless you’re planning on racing to endgame and gearing out before everyone else, BiS gear will eventually be possible to obtain, it’s just a matter of time. If you’re looking for someone to play with when classic comes out, none of my old friends will be playing so I’ll be looking for people to play with. Good luck!
---
Would something like this work at all? [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZbxtccZVhgzctot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZbxtccZVhgzctot) 
---
Its just that i really like healing, but i also like doing dmg and shadowform looks cool af
---
Yeah you have no idea what you’re talking about huh?
---
That looks awesome, do you have Shadow Priest or Arms warrior in there as well? That would sell me on it.
---
By this point there are plenty of people playing that were born post 2000.  I hate to bring generational generalizations up but the majority of them would have played games that were engaged in a race to the bottom of “convenience.”  Plenty of pre-2000 people are responsible as well (I can point to friends of mine) but it’s only going to metastasize.  Hoping classic will be our sanctuary!  Though I’m sure there’s a lot to poke fun at for wanting a sanctuary lol.
---
I'd like to assume that a mayor part of those playing classic is going to be of a certain adult level. Therefore they shouldn't be those who get influenced the easiest (which are teens).
---
If you have a healthy mind and are confident then you don't need all that stuff. Sadly that's something that's lacking in recent generations.
---
I never had to follow a certain guide or BiS or whatnot to get any guild invite so far. I've even played off-speccs successfully enough to be taking on by mythic guilds. There even was a time where i was one of those guys that did all this theorycrafting in forums telling players why "MY" way is the best one. It wasn't the average playstyle that was known as best and yet it was good enough to be taken into a World Top20 Guild at the time being - though I only lasted one content Cycle due to the insane time constraints.
---
No matter what you're trying to tell me about "It's pressure. Many lies become the truth" and all that bullshit. It's just not true. It's not. Anyone who is like this should grow their self conscience. 
---
Assuming one doesn't to be in the top #1 guild, they shouldn't care about what others say. Find a guild matching your playstyle. It's possible, even today. It's certainly more difficult because a huge amount of guilds are created by people CONVINCED they belong to the .1% of players who "know it all". But if you search enough through all this bullshit, you'd find a guild who don't care about the optimum whatever and they'll clear naxxramas eventually. Maybe just two or three months after the first guilds have cleared it but they will. And the level of fun you'd have had meanwhile beats out any optimization in performance every single goddamn day.
---
&gt; Do you think we are all stupid or something? If you are going to try and portray private servers as incorrect, at least pick realistic examples.
---
&gt; So I'll have to ask you to provide some sources for this insane claim.
---
&gt; ​
---
I've been hobby devving on my free time. It's easy to check. Just compile your own core and have a look, u can work it out from sniffing the core but regardless most damage scalings are set to be undertuned. Most dungeons on stock have bosses with like 3 or 4 times less damage scaling. And as I already stated in my post, it's a TBC port so mobs who are 28 in vanilla, nerfed to 23 in TBC, will have the stats of a level 23 as lvl 28 in CMangos aka vanilla servers.
---
Go have a look urself if you want
---
Really good job, I would love to use this myself when you finish! 
---
I just explained what I know about this.
---
You haven't said it would be easy, the other hundred people did. :)
---
It's a discussion, I've added my opinion, which doesn't fully agree with yours. I wouldn't mind any optional updates, after we got the original graphics and gameplay, without bugs. (I don't think it's likely, though.)
---
Cloak of Flames *(rare as heck)* - IIRC this had a 1:1 SP ratio until...TBC?? Its funny to have it on a healer in PVP and have melee kill themseleves. I believe you can only get this from 60+ monsters.
---
Blazefury Medallion *(Kazzak)* - Adds to your attacks, so I thought i'd throw it in there.
---
Naglering *(BRD)* - Easy to get.
---
Frosty, is that really you? Man I love your videos, they helped me a lot on pservers. I looked up Kargoz dor the leveling guides and your videos for everything else. 
---
Keep up the good work! I look forward to more of your videos. Especially when Classic drops and you’re gonna give us the legit videos we probably don’t deserve.
---
Thanks and may peace be with you, friend!
---
Why would it be overlooked? It used to be on by default. People used it fairly regularly and if there's no tool anymore people will go back using it. Heck, as a Tank and Healer it's not uncommon to receive whispers every couple of minutes with requests to join an existing group.
---
&gt; He is just spewing bs, ignore this retarded OP
---
found the &lt;apes&gt; player
---
Thank you! Is that all of it in the game? No engineering or enchant, or other items?
---
All I can remember off the top of my head. Other than ragnaros trinket shard of flame. 13 damage dealt when attacked.

This is great! A bit more explanation on what the "stages" mean would probably be good for people who never played Classic etc. Would also be cool if maybe there could be "player created" BiS lists that could be imported or such so you could have BiS lists for say, soloing content, or PvP etc. I know I won't have much time to raid compared to back when vanilla was out, so personally I'm looking to solo as much as I can.
---
If you're willing to put said BiS lists in yourself then there wouldn't be a need for Player Imported lists. If possible you should add talents too. So a player can come to one place and go "Ok I want to switch my raiding main from my druid to my holy paladin. To do that I need xyz gear and 123 talents to make that possible." all from your one site/app. Would be highly convenient and simple and great for both veteran and new players.
---
Seriously this is amazing! Keep it up!
---
 Most dungeons on **stock** have bosses with like 3 or 4 times less damage scaling. 
---
Oh they have different scaling on the **STOCK** version. Ok, you are just an idiot, and it would serve no purpose sitting here trying to argue. The stock version of ManGOS is not even close to the current private servers.
---
If only there was some website that had tons and tons of vanilla videos, and if only you could go look up a boss and see how much the bosses hit for in Vanilla and calculate it based on the tanks current armor in the video. If only someone had thought to do that in the 13 years of refining the private server experience.
---
There seems to be a lot of these people around these days. Those same people that grew up with WoW and played Classic have also been growing up with meme-culture, even crazier identity politics and the world is currently on a swing towards "political Right-side."
---
I can only guess, but it feels like it's a mix of many different things that have caused people to just become... even more *edgy* and rude. Games are more invested into these days and taken way more seriously too.
---
You can insult back and forth, be downright rude and shut people down with memes; because in the end, "it's just a prank bro."
---
&gt; cash shop
---
I like how people are just stating this as fact now, even though every bit of evidence we have points towards there not being a cash shop.
---
God I hate this community.
---
I would have never thought of the leather one, its hilarious and simple and something to do while afking in town. Good video!
---
I agree with you but this isn’t the mainstream broader opinion. 
---
You know this subreddit is in a sorry state when people people like you are defending a post full of nonsense with zero evidence. Let's attack the guy that had the audacity to not being nice, instead of requesting that people making claims back those claims up with proof.
---
That's how you get a toxic shithole like this subreddit.
---
This is awesome, looks intuitive enough to use, and will probably be really helpful to players who are newer to the classic scene who want to get into classic raiding.
---
Another solution would be to  just create  a group om your own  and  be ML. Just like in the raids  but  now also in 5 man groups
---
watching a lot of his content have left me thinking his Brain id a bit “special” honestly
---
And you defend people being unpolite and insult others. That has nothing to do with the toxicity around here...lmao
---
I probably started after their armor was fixed. I think I started playing about 1.08 or 1.09 (can't remember). However, Classic is 1.12 so that's relevant.
---
What a low IQ statement. SAD!
---
It feels so easy when watching...
---
but I remember how what the reality was. 
---
"Inventory is full"
---
No, once you get hit/ccd or hit/cc enemy player or anything that would triger the pvp template i guess follow stops working.
---
I believe there is spike from BS which you can put on shields to deal damage when you are block.
---
Right! I think Needing on anything should auto-bind. If the *only* way to get that is with Loot Trading, then I want Loot Trading. If they can do it without LT, then I'm once again in the position of LT effects being so insignificant as to not care about it either way.
---
The legendary necklace
---
With an attitude like that, I'm curious as to what motivates you to visit this sub.
---
I've played both and in my subjective experience Druids feel like the stronger dungeon tank out of the two. They have their limitations of course.
---
Wild prediction here but I think Feral will see play in high end guilds, especially on Horde for the reason that Horde Warriors need to wear more mitigation than Alliance Warriors, and Druids are a happy medium where they have slightly less mitigation than Warriors but make up for it with higher threat generation.
---
They'll probably never main tank on progression, but they'll be needed in the OT role.
---
&gt; I should run it 50 times
---
Yes, because obviously you are going to run it every time with the same group of dbags.
---
So countdown to classic is better ?
---
Sulforus, Hand of Ragnaros is one of them. The equip bonus deals 5 fire damage to attackers.
---
As someone who has a lot of retail vanilla experience (had 6 level 60s) and has played on a lot of private servers, this just isn't true on the higher quality servers. There are lots of little differences for sure, and people who have only played on private servers will probably be surprised at how different a ton of small details are, but overall the 'big picture' experience and difficulty is pretty similar. There are definitely mobs that are undertuned and/or missing abilities, but there are also mobs that do significantly more damage than retail or use their abilites too frequently, etc. 
---
I do believe that pservers are probably a little undertuned overall, but it's the min-maxing knowledge and overall higher skill level of the playerbase that make a much bigger impact on the easier feeling gameplay imo. 
---
Heh, he's not even going to admit he's just making stuff up with no evidence backing any of it up.
---
W3 is almost entirely related to Classic. Details like spells, icons, and racial architecture motifs come directly from there. Many of the settings were created in W3, such as most of the cities in Lordaeron, the Barrens, Ashenvale and more. Huge portions of the current events and background are from W3 as well, including:
---
-all of the forsaken story
---
-all of the plaguelands story, plus instances
---
-the story of how each of the Kalimdor horde races joined together, and the still relevant problems they face in zones from Durotar to Desolace.
---
-almost all of the background of the nightelves
---
-the characterization of key figures like Thrall, Sylvanas, Rexxar, and Jaina. Among others.
---
-history key to understanding faction politics and why things like the three battlegrounds are fought over.
---
&gt;  I don't think the purpose of Classic is to create better loot systems.
---
Let's all step back and remember that the purpose of Classic is to make money for Blizzard.
---
well if loot trading sticks then I hope masterlooting becomes the norm but I do see certain items being the center of "drama" felstriker and the flash recipe drop.  Honestly though the best way to go about loot trading is just to make it raid only or not have it at all
---
"Oh no. I posted a bunch of lies with zero proof and people are being mean to me"
---
Boo fucking hoo.
---
Funny way to spell *some* fans
---
Blizzard: Your decisions should matter.  
---
Also Blizzard: Your decision about who gets loot shouldn't matter, and here's a tool to enforce that stance.
---
No, we actually JOGGED.
---
In rain and SNOW.
---
It's a great start, and to save yourself a lot more work and from feature bloat keep it to the core mission, finding the best set of gear per tier. In that vein, I have two suggestions.
---
First, methodology/weighting. A link to the source/spreadsheet/theorycraft would build confidence in the list and possibly allow it to be improved(if you want to go in-depth or hook into platforms for doing so).
---
Second, build an array for each slot. The existence of legendaries and once a week raid lock outs mean that some items can be very difficult to obtain. Choose your own number, but having the top 5 items(for example) per tier gives additional goals and more reasons for app engagement.
---
Feel free to PM if you want.
---
Not true. We **jogged**, not walked, and only til 30, then got our travel form.
---
Yes Private Servers aren't vanilla, neither will Classic be. The closest thing that exists is the 1.12 client Blizzard is using internally.
---
It's still interesting to speculate which will be closer to vanilla between the best private servers and Classic. Blizzard has the advantage of comparing to their internal codebase, but it's a daunting task tearing apart all of the modern trappings of the retail client Classic is starting from.
---
Something like this could be pretty easily done with a cross platform solution like Flutter or Dart. 
---
i only know of Xamarin, never heard of those 2
---
Anyone have an idea of when WC3 reforged is set to be released? I wanted to play through the campaign before classic comes out.
---
It would be pretty stupid of blizzard to release WC3R after classic comes out right?
---
I'm sure It'll take longer due to the majority of the player base likely taking longer than the most dedicated to hit 60
---
Ah yes, it now makes sense.
---
But in a classic server, is that really an issue, as it is easy to blacklist people ? Ninja has consequences. I remember that on Nostalrius there was a thread with documented cases of ninja and a list of names to avoid.
---
This is what I always wanted to see done, but don't have the knowledge to make a reality! Thank you!
---
I also second the suggestion of including BiS alternatives to the sets, if possible. Some of those items are extremely hard to get and being able to see the second BiS item would help a lot as well. Other than that, this looks perfect to me.
---
The issue is that BiS is a \*list\* of items with values for each item based on some agreed upon weighting formula.
---
Sometimes the absolute best item ridiculously difficult to acquire while the next best item is 99% as good and just a quest reward. And sometimes the best item is difficult because, hey, we all don't agree on the weighting formula or it changes slightly based on spec choices.
---
Good players will understand and use the lists while bad players will just run the same dungeon over and over, trying to reserve a particular item and/or screaming bloody murder if it drops and someone else rolls on it.
---
Hey actually something to think about, when your main characters are all decked out and you just want to laugh your ass off.
---
Maybe I twink a Hunter and ask 9 Guildis to do the same. lol
---
Warrior tanks (the main users of it in vanilla) wouldn't be able to tank with it if it was 2 handed.
---
Where is all this private server hate suddenly coming from? Nobody is claiming private servers are 100% accurate or are ‘real’ vanilla. It’s just the best we got until classic comes out. And btw classic would not even be coming out if it wasn’t for Nostalrius. 
---
Essence of the Pure Flame from Ragnaros
---
Except it isn't. It's much easier to not do anything and have the loot system in the base client they are using stay in. Adding a popup is not going to stop ML problems that this fixes, nor will it end GM tickets for misloots that they have always fixed. Your idea adds an extra click, which will solve nothing and just piss of people, smooth.
---
In college I was supposed to pull an all-nighter and write a paper. So I took Adderall and logged onto World of Warcraft.
---
Ended up camping the rooftops of Gadgetzan on my NE hunter and trading shots with this undead warlock on another rooftop. We were /yelling stuff like "|=  |\_|  (  |&lt;    |\_|".
---
Back then the bruisers couldn't reach players on rooftops and also horde and alliance could communicate using non-alphabet keyboard characters.
---
I did this until 2 AM then started the paper.
---
Hopefully devilsour leather 
---
Since the writing has gone down the shitter since Cataclysm Warcraft III is refreshing in that Blizzard clearly had a thought out plot line that they could present without limitation. The gameplay constraints of WoW, i.e. their being two factions meant that the Undead have never been able to 'finish' their plot line, or become fully evil, they just ebb underwhemingly between the two.   
---
Vanilla had a nice fresh slate to begin with lore wise with set up plot lines, and you can definitely feel it. WOD's time travel and the constant back and forth even in WOTLK of Horde and Alliance fighting and their conveniently aligning has made WoW's lore incredibly stale in my opinion. Due to the game's need to be marketed and have a new plot line every expansion it means stories are never satisfyingly being concluded, and new contrivences are always being made.   
---
However, I don't think this is WoW as an MMO's fault, I still blame the writers. Whilst there are limitations to what you can do with a story in the confines of an MMO I still believe there is definitely a better way to handle plot lines and stories then they are currently doing. A new expansion comes out and then everything from it is forgotten almost from the previous one. Up until Cata I thought the WoW lore was incredibly rich and well thought out. I am very disenfranchised these days especially with the whole Sylvanas (definitely not Garrosh 2.0) scenario because I feel like I am able along with the entire community to wrip apart giant amounts of the new stories being written.   
---
Whereas before WoW lore felt mysterious, magical and written by people whose ideas' seemed incredibly unique, it now feels like we are being told a tale from a year 7 English class; something that has interesting ideas but does not have a professional approach to writing out plot lines with the knowledge that they can be worked on over time, or by simply sweeping over massive plot lines.   
---
Exactly. The synergy that was created when various units got together in WC3 was strongly resembled when classes got together in Vanilla. Classes were very distinct and that unique tool kit everyone brought created a spectacular synergy. 
---
The quest actually starts inside the dungeon. 
---
But whatever you say I guess. You should write a guide. 
---
I laffed. Thank u sir. 
---
Asmongold was a Grand Marshal...
---
BfA is too different for this to be a good change. The game is now built around jumping all over the place and running old instances every week, and so its playerbase now consists of people who like that. Removing the portals appeals to a demographic that doesn't play the game anymore.
---
I want this right now.
---
LOL no.
---
Reign of Chaos is strongly connected to Vanilla. Meanwhile, The Frozen Throne is strongly connected to TBC and WOTLK.
---
I don’t care what they do with sharding or loot trading I just want to play classic.
---
Once is enough, if a rare item drops.
---
To me it seems classic was grindy for the sake of fun. Modern wow is grindy for the sake of keeping players so they pay you their monthly payment. 
---
Xamarin is a pretty hardcore solution, Flutter is pretty much for simple Web Apps like OP has. 
---
Don't forget items you can use, if you farm the ungoro crystals you can get a usable lightning shield buff that lasts like 10 minutes? don't remember how much but its 10 or 12 or something
---
You literally copied this post from an earlier post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avgmrd/ngorongoro\_crater\_in\_tanzania\_one\_of\_the\_worlds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avgmrd/ngorongoro_crater_in_tanzania_one_of_the_worlds/)
---
No censorship, fewer causals, and less stability.
---
Right if not not wrong
---
How about we put away the pitchforks until we get ANY word from devs on HOW they plan on implementing it?
---
It's a good motto in the long run because you never know who will return the favor. I will still help unknowns from time to time but I will filter out the most time consuming tasks which will be easier now that I know the game.
---
&gt; ts inside the dungeon.
---
&gt; But whatever you say I guess. You should write a guide.
---
Sure. Compare Alliance and horde quests. Horde does not need prequest, while alliance need to visit darnassus first. Quest "In Search of Thaelrid".
---
Happy?
---
What the other guy said, i confirm
---
Hey nice videos slyce! Those who journied to the unknown parts of wow share a common experience of exploration. I would expect there are many individuals in the community who were noggaholic fans or found their own paths.
---
Video editing and product/dev skills are important tools I've picked up and apply to a Prof career. But what makes it enjoyable is the ability to create a new product from nothing which others can enjoy.
---
The passion to explore in wow or the rworld come from an natural sense of wonder. Or maybe we just listened to Celldweller to much while gaming. (Ref. slyce 1)
---
Don't ever let the wall walkers fall...
---
Yes get rid of loot trading, Blizzard can say we won’t deal with loot situations and what has already been said in this thread, and if they want to add this feature I’m not necessarily against it
---
Knowing you can't get help for those mistakes will make people more careful, too
---
That doesnt make much sense considering how Private servers dont have all info and has to ball park a ton of numbers etc while the "rebuilt" stuff from Blizzard will be a lot more accurate and thus more true gameplay. 
---
if you need item should be found, if you greed you should be able to trade it. easy solution
---
"On or before December 2019"

https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-reforged
---
What makes you think that your suggestions on how to fix loot trading would be any more likely than them just not having it at all? I find your cynicism here pretty off-putting.
---
Haha why are you straving from the argument?  
---
Loot trading will be abused if its implemented in the game  
---
My idea: Make need items BoP to go against it  
---
Your argument: Exept that it wont fix the problem of missklicking.  
---
My idea:  implement an easy solution adding an extra klick THAT HAS BEEN IN GAMES for years to fix the missklick problem.  
---
Your artgument : its not a n easy solution and is hard to implement.
---
Me: it is.  
---
Sorry this is an arumgent you lost bye bye
---
Its not about sit critting its about those crits procing on crit effects, which apparently they didn't
---
Vanilla hasn't been solved btw.
---
I'd argue it matters even less in that scenario. 
---
This is really cool - seems like it's a phone app?  Hopefully there's a web version of it too!
---
Lmao exactly!! It is bound to your freakin’ SOUL!! I guess it would require some powerful kind of magic to unbind it from your soul, not some poor change in data files or w/e 👀 
---
Nah, whatever classic devs do, it doesn't matter, people will always find something else to complain about. We all love to complain and rarely bother to praise.
---
I would have zero prob with a LFG function as long as it remains server centric 
---
Says the tank 
---
Its worth noting that the current loot trading system on retail only allows trading of GREEDED items. Originally it did apply to NEED items as well, but there was too much abuse and so now its limited to greed-only. 
---
I would love for this to be available on PC as well, OP. Great work!
---
Hahaha, I literally did because it was removed by the submission. So I figured I had to tweek it a little. It's still me who posted the first one. Cheers
---
Bold of you to assume I can afford a second monitor
---
Except that while ret or reck is actually fairly solid in PvP, enhancement is useless both in PvE and PvP.
---
Rogue all the way.  Never a moment of doubt. Now once I reach endgame and Preraid BiS I will alt a few others. But as a main it is not even a question. 
---
Well he is dumb because horde rules /s
---
Good luck with that, you have a shitty idea and keep trying to back it up with nonsense. Loot trading will be in, get used to the idea.
---
And you were the reason why I had to improve it anyway as you stated: It looks nothing like Un'Goro Crater. 
---
Oh i will, and i will abuse the fk out of it if its in.
---
Was about to write the same lol
---
Cool, enjoy everyone's ignore list and nobody willing to play with you because you are a shitbag. I'm glad we figured out you were a ninja early and just looking for an excuse.
---
I wont be, as i will have friends and guilds to play with LUL
---
In Vanilla, ninja looting was final, but someone rolling need to give an item to a friend was not.
---
Not with your attitude.
---
Youd be supriuused how many people there are with the same attitude
---
&gt;Nobody has any illusions that Private Servers are off to some degree.
---
Vanilla itself was off to some degree. 
---
The whole thing lasted for two years and almost every odd month, you had a new content patch chock full of changes to all kinds of numbers and mechanics. Have fun representing that accurately. 
---
If Classic or PServers are off, that's just another patch day. The real important thing are the broad strokes and I think they'll be able to get those right enough, PServers perhaps more so than Classic. That'll depend on how they handle it. 
---
Depending on your AP, blood thist will hit almost as hard as MS... But you get better rage gen in fury.
---
The epic tank shield sort of does as a proc.
---
you were supposed to defeat the adbloats not join them
---
If you get pre raid bis (dungeons and crafting) guilds will flock for you to raid with them
---
That's your opinion and that's fine. Still your behavior is more toxic than a post that might consist of some unproven statements.
---
But hey, keep being you. That's what the internet is about these days. 
---
Agol and bur is something I've seen a lot. Maybe bur is lol? 
---
This is fucking excellent, if you can include alternate gear pieces for each slot and spec that'd make this the be-all end-all for people looking to gear for raids in a user-friendly manner.
---
not what i ment :)
---
more of what time it takes for the economy to get stable on AH from people leveling and some rushing profs etc. alot of items that goes for higher/less due to resource/demand ratio.
---
There are also some gloves from stratholme. But that's also "damage when attacked"
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the reason some tanks favor KT shield is because high base block value rather than 'Equip:' block value means more damage off Shield Slam? Plus more armor
---
was soul link dispellable from lock or pet in vanilla
---
Wow head, show me BiS for "nude tane"
---
&gt;22000k for a normal opponent, 25000k against physical damage dealers.
---
So 22,000,000 / 25,000,000 hp? damn that's a good talent
---
I'm playing on WotLK private server and this never happens. Are you guys really that paranoid?
---
Retail player: Rogue in a caster outfit, hell what am I watching? This is friggin gay.
---
Classic player: Your welcome!
---
Two of the most exciting parts of the game for me back in Vanilla were 1) Entering Tanaris for the first time and visiting Gadgetstan, discovering the dual-faction AH there 2) Entering Un Goro early to mine that precious ore :).  Love that zone.
---
Lol, I’ve tanked UBRS and Strat so many times I’ve still got the pulls memorized. Haven’t tanked seriously since vanilla. 
---
Implying there won't be other dbags in others groups.
---
For reference, [These](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4&amp;filter=sl=28;)
---
Notable examples, instance random drop BoE [Totem of Storm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23199), [Idol of the Moon](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23197), or [Libram of Fervor](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23203).
---
As the game is based on 1.12, but will only have end game content releases, items such as these have no apparent reason why they shouldn't be obtainable -- as the mobs that drop the item are available content.
---
There's enough bosses with fear mechanics that people roll dwarf for fear ward.  To act like it serves no pve purpose is disingenuous.
---
This looks AWESOME! Great job, can't wait to see more!
---
Wow this is great!  Is this going to be an app?  Id LOVE to use it!
---
You're the one not familiar with the term bis.  In vanilla, lots of slots are dependent on current gear and spec.  For the most part, there is no set bis list until Naxx.
---
Be my guest and go for it at classic launch 👌
---
I feel that if you put it like this, people who never played vanilla won't understand just how disadvantaged some specs are.
---
For a while now, even the weakest DPS specs on retail don't tend to dip bellow 75% of the strongest spec's DPS. The true PvE DPS "memespecs" (Retribution, Enhancement, Balance and Elemental) are happy if they can do more than 60% of a mainspec player's DPS.
---
Wow looking good!
---
I cant imagine a lot of people will play WC3R if they are playing classic
---
&gt; Well, people do that an awful lot in retail.
---
No, they don't. 
---
The reality is with the whole "community will fix it" thing is that no one is going to care if someone needs and ninjas a Deadmines item or something from SM, the ONLY person who will care is the person who got screwed over
---
Also like OP said, what's stopping people from bribing others to roll need for them? The community isn't the same as it was in 2004, if someone offers someone else 100+ gold to roll need an item, I am willing to bet my arm that 99.9% of people would take that offer.

---
It might happen, but it will be such a rarity that it's absolutely NOT worth to have a completely different result (= loot being final, that's not how vanilla was) that has even less to do with how it was back then.
---
That's just false. Improved Healing Wave is great, LHW blows through your mana and a standard healing wave is a dangerously long cast. Totemic Focus helps you move much faster while keeping your mana high. Healing Way + Tidal Mastery + Ancestral Healing makes downranking spaming HW a part of your game play.
---
Resto is certainly not NECESSARY for healing dungeons, but it's definitely better, and is much more fun healing as resto than other specs.
---
I leveled as Prot back in Vanilla. I knew that Arms would be better, but I wanted to do as many dungeons as I could, and to practice as Prot, because I was a tank in an MMO before WoW, and I wanted to be a tank in WoW also.
---
That being said...it took me 51 days / played to hit lvl 60, while being stomped in WPvP by any other player while leveling.
---
Now, on private servers, I leveled 3 times to 60, as Arms, and it's not only WAY faster, but you can reliable tank (not as good as a Prot, but close enough) any 5 men/10 men dungeons. Killing stuff in the world is much easier, and you can actually win 1/3rd of the 1 vs 1 encounters in WPvP, or even more, if you initiate the fight.
---
Its definitely FAR too late in the design process for any changes to be made with regards to this. 
---
1.12 is the earliest patch they found in their database. And it won't be 1.12 or 1.12.1 it's 1.13.
---
Sit/crit was in game and was normal.  
---
Sit/crit proccing abilities that worked on crit was not. If you had decent latency it would not work. If you just sat down, it would not work. The only way to get it to work was to spam a /sit macro so that you would be sitting when the game calculated damage/crits and standing when the game calculated whether the hit would calculate abilities.
---
You do realize we are roughly 3-5 months from release, right?
---
Yeah, but can't they just remove some content temporarily, or at least change the talent trees?
---
Pick up enchanting to get lesser magic wand and greater magic wand I would get whatever profs you like after that but those two wands will make your life so much easier from 1-20.
---
They're strong PvE healers. The only major downside of a priest in Vanilla is the 50g respec cost. You can't really do PvP or do much solo content as a PvE healing spec. So whenever you want to PvP or do anything besides heal a group, you're paying 50g if you want to do it effectively. 
---
Hi, /u/OG_Goob
---
In some cases, I think it would be helpful to have affordances to allow the user to see the next two items after BIS. e.g. Yeah thunderfury is BIS, but knowing alternatives could be important if RNG is not in your favor.
---
Maybe asking for too much but... Also, how much of a difference is an item better than the next best item. For instance, it might take a 5 week rep grind to get the true BIS, but maybe with running a few 5-mans I can get the next best thing which does nearly the same thing.
---
Still not a beta up, so we can still hope they will do whats necessary.
---
and larger population in general
---
you basically destroy your tab key
---
and thats correct. youd get destroyed, lol. you have virtually zero aoe dps as a prot warrior
---
How do I attain such a thing?
---
I already did it on a vanilla server two days ago. 
---
Personally I started Vanilla in 2015 and I have 7 lvl 60 from 1x servers. I have never even raided BWL/ZG/AQ/Naxx so I am proof that if there is one thing you can do in Classic, that is to play it casually and have fun! So don't worry about that. There will always be guilds that do MC/Ony/ZG for all kind of players but AQ/Naxx may not be possible for super casuals but that doesn't matter much for 95% of all players.
---
it was, but only from the pet.
---
It is going to be wild to see the old Sunken Temple dungeon again. I played the current iteration during Legion and I was shocked at how much they simplified the zone, I think it was reduced to just one floor? It will be a treat getting lost in it again.
---
Block value is just the amount of damage you block when you block an attack. A T3 tank has 30% chance to block and an avg block value of 210.
---
The aq40 shield is the best block shield but it lacks armor the naxx shields give. Kt shield is usually the best because it gives the most efficient stat spread between armor, stats, and block.
---
Really like wtf, do you enjoy the game calculating shit like this. I hope i can ninja your stuff lol nerd. You need people like me to make classic like real classic. Xxx 
---
Back in my days, it was generally accepted that you need on the role you currently fill in the dungeon. 
---
If you wanted something else, people expected you to speak up in advance. Some groups were fine with it, others not. Was a case by case thing. 
---
Just need on everything 
---
The most recent popular server had a *really* smooth launch. 
---
Lol hope springs eternal, haha
---
Pre level 52 - don't need on cloth unless your group's casters don't want/need it. If you're building a healy set, I guess need on leather/mail and obvs plate.
---
52+ BIS is BIS. Need away if it drops.
---
Need on everything and sell it
---
Could this be improved upon to show total stats? Like total +heal, mp5, spell crit etc?
---
This. When I reluctantly switched from spriest to holy/disc for raiding, my soloing time went to effectively zero.
---
I know this is an unpoular opinion, but I'm all for loot sharing in raids. Too many guilds break up because of miss-clicks.
---
Where are you from? You have an interesting accent. :)
---
[Fixed](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/awkxvw/me_right_now_per_request/)
---
To a certain degree. Yes.
---
White damage is a primary source of threat generation outside of sunder armour. This is the basis behind various BiS tanking weps being daggers or just generally fast wep speed normal one handers.
---
simply put, if you plan to tank as a warrior pre 40ish, using a slow wep speed main hand, it's going to be rough. A miss, a parry or even a dodge with a 2.2+ wep is going to mean serious downtime, delay on the first sunder (as you don't generate rage from the first white hit) and likely going to cause some issues with the pull. 
---
I find tanking from 20-55ish is relatively easy with Fury. High wep speed, flurry procs, you'll be able to run in, get plenty of rage up, and start cycling through the trash packs applying a single sunder to each and some white damage as you go. You should only really build enough threat on the first mob in the pack as you think you'll need to hold its aggro before it dies to dps. By the time the first mob dies, you should have well and truly got  sunder(s) and some white damage on the other 2 or so mobs.
---
tldr: 
---
 \- yes hitting the mobs with white damage is an important source of threat.
---
\- Fast wep speed = much easier tanking experience
---
\- you will have to cycle through non-CC'd mobs in each pull to establish some threat. sunders+white dmg
---
I would only get tipped like 10 silver back in vanilla. Of course if you convert that to retail $ thats probably like 1000g
---
Wowhead / datamining.
---
I meant even better than what retail has now. Those old world environments are soooo cool I want to experience them with even better detail. I know it’s a lot to ask for but it would be fun to relive it that way.
---
My prayers were answered! 
---
You, sir, are awesome! That is my new inspiration come classic. Thank you, it’s very good indeed :)
---
You just gotta be a bad ass and tank them all
---
kek
---
Can't really blame them. WoW is a different game now. The game they're all subscribed to and paying for is the zero-interaction action RPG. We all quit paying for it because we want an MMORPG. They're right to get mad at Blizzard making changes to the type of game that they're paying for, just like we got mad as Blizzard changed it to be more casual. 
---
Yes, Sunken temple along with many of the vanilla dungeons are the best blizzard ever designed (in terms of immersion). And I also enjoy that dungeon before it was gutted.
---
The problem is that the class quests at lvl 50 rewards really fucking good items, that will be stronger than most items you get from dungeons or even raids. And thats one of the issues if they start off wrong in 1.12.1
---
Going to dive in WC3 or WC3 remastered (if, released before Classic). 
---
Maybe I want a horcrux ok?
---
Tier 1: World pvp
---
Shit tier: arena and bg
---
I strongly disagree, I see more people like yourself complaining about a toxic community which doesn't exist in the capacity you think it does... 
---
If you think limiting the debuffs is what makes the raids easy you must really think youre going back to 2004. The whole game is gonna be easy because of the immense knowledge we have about the game
---
 Nothing blizzard does can stop the rofl stomping of MC.
---
I think one of the problems with how people are representing 'Ninjas' is the idea that they are going to be more rare than they actually are. I can't speak for how the game used to be as I came into WoW a bit further down the line, so I don't have an accurate idea of how often it happened back then. But I do think it will be far more often at the start of Classic WoW. 
---
People will be playing the game to make their early gold. This means that low level dungeons are going to be constant ninja fights. 
---
People are going to be more greedy throughout because they are used to the more fast paced WoW of recent years where these types of gear were commonplace and therefore free game for all. Green gear means a lot while leveling depending on how old your previous gear in the slot was, and blue gear is HUGE, but in current WoW you get a random decent blue for completing the mission and likely a blue or two available per boss kill, no matter the dungeon. 
---
People won't may not think the game is going to last. This means that people will be far more willing to cheat others if they think the game will be done and over soon. Just think of all these other games with base building and such like Ark Survival Evolved--if a server is dying, or if a server is going to have a map wipe, the players go crazy trying to do whatever mayhem they can possibly do. Obviously that doesn't mean the Classic WoW playerbase will go that nuts. It's just that since they don't know how the retention of the game is going to balance out, they might decide it will go poorly and do what they want, instead of fearing the repercussions.
---
All in all, I think this game is going to be full of no good cheats (the thieving kind) for a good while until the playerbase settles and a true community develops. Once the community develops, then community guidelines can be established. Once thats done, Mad Max turns into a potential true society. I think the real problem becomes the fact that Loot Trading is a "true society" kind of ability. Either people fear the repercussions of stealing and give it up, fear the blacklisting involved with cheating people out of things, or they will do whatever they need to to get what they want. So Mad Max will not be helped with Loot Trading in my eyes....but when a community is set up, it would be nice. And I think Blizzard is just a bit too happy with the thought of a community being built instantly, because its still WoW-so obviously the community is still there-not realizing that that takes a lot of time to re-establish.
---
&gt; Implying there won't be other dbags in others groups.
---
There absolutely won't be. I can count the number of dbags I encountered in Vanilla and TBC on one hand.
---
The Classic population is going to be completely different than the private server population. For starters, there's going to be a $15/month filter for all of the cheap assholes. Secondly, there's going to be a tremendous influx of casual players (casual, not bad) who are not going to be stressing out over every gear drop.
---
Those are the people you are going to be pugging with, not the min-max tryhards attempting to win an RPG.
---
cool tool, bad lists
---
Can you specify that? Streamers are a little bit special in general. But I don't favor tips in any way, just came into my mind first. 
---
The protection tree is a talent tree made for endgame tanking specifically. It's not meant to tank 5-mans because tanking is something all warriors can do with their core rotation / spells.
---
This is the biggest psychological hurdle I see retail warriors are going to have when they come to Classic. It'll probably blow their minds to find out that on pservers, because of how Classic threat / DPS works, the best endgame tanks are actually Fury warriors lol.
---
Full world buffed is common things even for non-hardcore guild nowadays! Thats req like 20-30minutes(DM clear+STV Isle heart buff+Head buff is mandatory for EVERY raider). Songflower is pretty common too.
---
If guild is not using at least heart/head buff that guild is bad guild for sure, you dont need to waste time with them!
---
This is amazing. I wish I had it now, its so good. You are sitting on a great idea/app for the upcoming classic, and with it some serious fucking money/ad revenue.
---
Benefit of Loot Trading:
---
Valuable BOE drops. Without loot trading, jerk player needs it, drops group and sells it on the AH
---
With loot trading, the BOE becomes bound on Need, meaning player can't sell it on AH. Therefore jerk player rolls Greed.
---
Best in Slot means the best item possible for that slot. Not like 4 or 5 almost as good pieces
---
The mechanic they're talking about was not in 1.12. 
---
It's mostly an issue in dungeons, it's much less of an issue in raids (which is why I've been an advocate for restricting loot trading to raids if they're going to implement it)
---
This is fucking sick
---
Loot Sharing will ruin pugs though. It will not ruin everything but it will ruin pugs... It will also make all loot GDKP in the way that you can whsiper anyone in your group and ask to buy the loot they won and that will be a huge incentive for RMT (real money trading, aka, buying gold, leads to extra inflation on top of normal rmt and inflation).
---
it wasn't in 1.12
---
!Remindme 2 months
---
This right here!
---
Gold DKP is pretty cool thing! You can farm gold with an good geared alt!
---
Ya, that's the main point though. It's just dungeons. If you take an elemental shaman, they can heal everyone fine ... and help blow trash up making the dungeon run twice as fast.
---
Fury is shitty spec for lvling! ARMS FTW!
---
PS players will be &lt;1%
---
As a software engineer in the game industry, no. I don’t think people understand how crazy this project is in the first place. Taking 1.12 data and putting it in the current engine/client/backend is insane. Imagine taking a square stone and trying to push it through a star shaped hole. You can’t, so you have to reshape it to a star, but now that it’s through you have to make it a square again, so you have to come up with how to transform it back, but you don’t have the original designs or tools used to make it the way it was. All they have really is the original client to compare, it’s like putting together a lego from looking at the picture but without instructions.  I will be shocked of it isn’t plagued with bugs and differences for the first month or so. 
---
in 3 subreddits?
---
25K effective HP, still dies to getting mind controlled off a cliff.
---
In all seriousness, great writeup!
---
&gt; So you’re not worth my time. 
---
writting a wall of text after saying this is oxi*moronicall*  
---
&gt; I’m not even clear what you’re trying to debate
---
you should blame your ineptitude and try to practice more.
---
&gt;  You attempted to counter my claim with an angry rant about points they haven’t brought up.
---
just because you're emotionally challenged doesn't mean that everyone else is angry. i was pointing out that they are avoiding communication by tackling minor issues. even you said that the issues that they are avoiding "have been discussed to death" so obviously  ppl are more interested in those topics over the fact that the imp will disapear when you summon your vw.
---
&gt; Just because you don’t care that Blizz is fixing minor details, doesn’t make that info non-news. 
---
just because you care doesn't make the info news. 
---
&gt; As is, literally everything you’re complaining about is a “hot topic” here that has been discussed to death. I’m completely tired of arguing those points with people like you. People that are so unhinged emotionally about these points that they’re raging and illogical. 
---
no one asked you to discuss about these. it was the devs opinion about the topics. it looks like you need all the help you can get understanding basic issues.
---
&gt; Enjoy frothing at the mouth over nothing. 
---
once more - non issues. erghmawgerdt sO aNgRy rItE nAu
---
&gt; Also, you realize that they may not have made final decisions about anything you’ve mentioned. Right?
---
maybe some final decisions have been drawn maybe not. point is you dont know. point is you're speculating on bulshit because that's all you got.
---
&gt; If that is the case, and these decisions aren’t finalized yet, then you’re basically just angry at reality right now. Basically just yelling because something that takes time, isn’t ready yet. 
---
 inventing shit and going down the rabbit hole with it is both hilarious and childish.
---
my points stands. you're still trying to figure wtf is going on.
---
[also if you're gonna stop replying i'm gonna stop wasting your time] (https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-02/24/16/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_original-1091-1424812563-13.gif)
---
how do you know its not happening? thats the worst part of this whole thing, you can get ninjad without even realizing it.
---
Sure, and you did it with a grp of players around your lvl aswrll👌 ypu must be a god 
---
Generally healers and tanks are allowed to roll on dps items for their leveling (dps) spec. 
---
At 60, however, tanks and healers need to defer to dps'ers trying to get bis. This is where loot trading will be a big help. If a healer/tank needs on a dps bis, they can easily trade it to the dps'er.
---
I don't see the problem with "reserve" groups. 
---
If you don't like them... don't join them and make your own group instead? This is what I did on pservers and it was damn easy to make your own group when people realise nothing is being reserved. People just don't want to put in the effort of making their own groups.
---
But at the same time, if you are advertising reversed loot and people still join your group... what is wrong with that? To me it just makes sense, don't see why its an ultra-toxic private-server-only trait.
---
Locks can tank Onyxia.
---
Yes. I’m trying to figure out what you’re trying to debate. 
---
They announced news. You still haven’t presented evidence refuting that fact. So there’s nothing to debate. 
---
They don't handle miss-loots on private servers and it's working just fine. Only time I have ever needed a GM for loot was when both me and the ML couldn't loot an item, it was just stuck on the mob.
---
Blizzard fanboys are the worst. 
---
Not until mortal strike 
---
Is this prototype on invision? Anyways, very cute mockup for it all. I like it. I hope that for each slot, it'll show at least a couple alternate pieces. For example true faith robes vs. Robes of the exalted for a priest. 
---
Also born in 2001, definitely very excited for classic! I’ve been playing a lot on vanilla private servers which are really fun.
---
IMO, yes 
---
I'm worried the younger players who try it will not make it past level 30, or more realistically level 20. It's fun, but it's a completely different type of game than what it's been for the last 10 years. You have to work for everything you want, nothing worth having in Classic will be fast or easy to get, and a lot of people who never played old WoW are spoiled by how ridiculously easy it is to do anything in the game. If they can get past that though, it's a fun game that's an actual mmo, as opposed to the theme park queue simulator it's been since Cata. 
---
Get on the wiki of r/fitness and choose a beginner routine. Really makes a difference following a structured program. Might also get your eating on point, but one step at a time.
---
Yeah it's a way overblown concern. 
---
if you're not needing on valuable boe's, its your own fault.
---
Been looking for something like this for a while. Just an estimate how much critical etc is worth so u can plan your gear. Will check it out, thanks.
---
It’s not gonna happen. 1.12 is confirmed including the improved itemization and everything. 
---
At this point it’s safe to say that Classic raiding will be a joke. Unless they decide to overtune the bosses like private servers do. 
---
Holy fuck why is everyone so goddamn paranoid about this incredibly small change? I HIGHLY doubt that loot trading will be as huge of an issue as people like you are making it out to be. Even if it does start happening, people will learn to turn ML on and start reserving things. Stop escalating stupid, small, and petty bullshit just because you want something to whine about.
---
Or give their leave notice (lol)
---
As someone who barely played in the old world and has spent more time leveling in the cata zones than almost any other game, using very cool and legal ways of experiencing how it used to be, it's not as jarring as you might think. Also, don't assume every young person wants the same thing! Thanks for your input!
---
TIL all young people are impatient
---
Makes sense to me. I can totally imagine doing that myself 😂
---
Or they can just not roll on it, no loot trading required. 
---
This is amazing! 
---
Lol, I wrote "22k" and then changed to "22000", thinking it would look better ... but I forgot to remove the "k" \^\^ Thanks for the comment :)
---
Private servers have nailed progressive itemization and true vanilla patch by patch content in extreme detail such as adding thoroum brotherhood recipes implemented in 1.5,1.6, and 1.9 and not all at once that i dont, and nobody who plays private servers, think blizzard will ever come close to. 
---
Even more so the reason to speak louder to out-voice the wannabe-elitists ;)
---
Honestly this. If you're gonna use it in some context of the game, be it leveling or filling a different roll, roll on it. From 1-59, loot is frequently replaced and quest greens are almost as good. You're grouping with a bunch of people who statistically won't make it to 60. Better to just avoid the whole stage of arguing what is "fair" and embrace the chaos of the dice.
---
Now when it comes to pre-raid BiS farming, that's a different matter. Then if you're rolling outside of the roll your filling in the group, you damn well better have a conversation about it before leaving town.
---
🤔
---
the point is, this kind of ninja is not visible, if people are not super stupid about it. sure, if a mage is needing on felstriker, its obvious ninja, but your warrior buddy who already has it in his bags, but not equipped, doesnt raise a lot suspicion.
---
In your example I see three players, all participating in content. 
---
Since they’re alll participating in this content, they are eligible to roll on loot when it drops. Because they’ve earned it. 
---
If the game’s RNG assigns loot to them, because luck, and they earned the right to roll by participating, I’m not clear why it matters if they reallocate that piece to a guilty. 
---
They’ve earned the right to roll on it. RNG then fell in their favor. 
---
As is it just encourages full guild groups. Which is 100% positive. It discourages pugging. It encourages community, by making it substantially more worthwhile to do full guild groups. 
---
It’s win win. We’d all see it if we just calmed down a bit. 
---
its not overblown, if anything people dont take it seriously enough.
---
Fuck this are so good.  Do you have any social media links ? :) 
---
what about time-worth? once more you cant stand behind your claims.
---
you should read my response once again because i did. maybe you'll figure it out 
---
rEeDaiNg Iz hARdT. 
---
&gt;\[...\] including the improved itemization and everything.
---
If "everything" also includes CRBGs, I could see that becoming a big point of contention. 
---
If they want to alleviate GM's workload, just update the model: GMs won't restore any loot on randomly rolled soulbound items, and add loot trading in a master loot situation only. This is the only place where it makes sense since it will be a raid or reserve run. 
---
The only solution with the way gear works in vanilla with itemization and drops that are BIS for multiple classes is to do the above. Loot trading is not workable with 5 mans in vanilla. And unlike WOTLK, if you get shafted you can't just hop back in LFD and do heroic whatever in 11 minutes. 
---
Loot trading is part of a whole overhauled dungeon, itemization and rolling system. You can't just pull one part out you like. 
---
Drillborer Disk (MC) does damage to everyone who hits you.
---
Crest of Retribution (UD Strat) doesn't damage every time you get hit, but does higher return damage every time you block.  Plus, you can put a shield spike on any shield to do block damage.
---

---
The helmet from Gnomer gives you a 10 minute thorns like buff after Zaping everything in front of you for Nature Damage.
---
The Skullflame Shield and Engineering shield have an AoE return damage proc.
---
It's not Vanilla. Nothing more needs to be said.
---
Yup, nothing wrong with small favors for a stranger. As long as it doesn't become a systematic imbalance.
---
He isn't smart with numbers. His data tends to be fucked unless somebody else prepares it for him. I agree with the other dude that Tipsout is an iffy source of information. 
---
But, Paladin tanks specifically are fantastic for leveling as a tank. You have far better aoe threat, and if you watch your main target, you dont have issue with aggro in a 5 man setting. Prot warrior is the worst tank spec until they def cap. Druids also have taunt and aren't impacted by itemization during leveling, so bear tanking is also solid.  
---
Private servers ARE completely different, it is nothing close to the original. Only 12 years olds that never played Vanilla retail think it is. 
---
He said better
---
16 debuff slots is only an issue if they don't adjust difficulty. If they adjust difficulty, then 16 slots is far, far superior to begin with as it improves class diversity in raids. We have to wait and see.
---
Talents mean nothing. Private servers are used to this and 1.12 game play is the best balance between classes the game ever had.
---
!.12 does not mean that that content is in game. Itemization is patched in over time. This is why they call it progression.
---
I highly doubt that Blizzard attempts to emulate the true difficulty through progression and it will feel more like how it plays on private servers. This is not a big deal. The game actually plays at a difficulty much more attractive to the modern player anyway, while still keeping a solid Classic feel and flavor.
---
The reality is likely that Classic is 1.12 emulation built as a stand alone product. It is it's own entity. Basically making private "Bliz-like" servers just a tiny bit more "Bliz-true" and that's it. I really do hope that they plan for at least 5 patches and not 4 however.
---
&gt;add loot trading in a master loot situation only
---
Every system is going to have unintentional affects that cannot be predicted. As I see it they should keep it as it was and not move soulbound loot. The number of times people misallocate loot with ML is pretty low anyway.
---
I mean it's cute but it's not really true.  Fallout New Vegas, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, Elder Scrolls Online, all pretty much buggy messes when they released, all patched into being excellent games.  I'm sure there's plenty of others too, those are just the ones that come to mind immediately.
---
If you are only comparing absolute details you're right. But as this game is more than details everywhere you simply cannot say it is "nothing close to the original". Actually it's pretty impressive how close private servers are. But who am I to judge pservers, as an almost 30 year old who did play vanilla retail ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Tips might be a tard, but Paladins and Druids are better tanks pre-60 than warriors, generally speaking. Neither classes' crippling issues at 60 impact them during leveling. Both run into iffy endgame itemization. Druid is at warrior's mit levels later on, AQ and Naxx, but Paladin is gimped by mana and very poor itemization. 
---
During leveling, specifically in 5 mans, warrior offers the least utility out of tank classes. all classes are poorly itemized during leveling, so warrior's great use of gear is pretty much canceled out. The mana issues Prot runs into don't apply when most pulls don't last long enough to OOM. Druid is the same case, they can roll hots on themselves before a pull, go bear, and while those hots are up, they have incredible mit, again, better in 5 mans than raids. 
---
Firestone warlock
---
It's a big issue because dungeons in vanilla sometimes take hours to go through and loot doesn't fall from the sky. This could waste hours of someones time if they were in that run specifically for that one end boss piece of loot. You multiply that over the course of a several dungeon runs and you have yourself a pretty shitty problem.
---
Very much so!
---
I really really want global chat to die.
---
Sure, I know what the numbers are. I've done a lot of looking at logs, and cleared naxx myself. The classic fights aren't tuned very tightly, so while you might do 75% of a warrior player's damage on ret, that's still more than enough to meet your dps requirement. 
---
If you keep up on consumables, any spec is fine. 
---
Which server is that?
---
Deep wounds quite terrible when you have 5% crit, making it 10% is an enormous difference. It also helps the early level way more than any other talent. 
---

I was born a couple years ago and I’m stoked

and he hasn't centered his entire brand around Classic. Asmon is the heart of WoW community, he does amazing things like his transmog and mount competitions. 
---
Retail uses personal loot. There is no need/greed. Items can be traded between players but everyone has separate rolls on whether something will drop for them. 
---
You do not compete against others for an item. The only competition that happens is when people whisper another player if they needed the item they got from personal loot.
---
Removed per rule 7. This post is already on top of this page.

Removed per rule 1.

As someone who has almost no classic/vanilla experience this is going to help me greatly!! As I'm sure even more experienced players, keep up the good work. As a prototype it already looks good man. You're doing God's work 😎👊

There's one limitation that addons won't work around: 50 mails. If there are 1 item/mail, it means that you can withdraw only 50 items and they you have to reload UI or wait 1 minute. If there are 12 items per mail, it means that you can withdraw 600 items and that's much faster. Also existence of addons should not affect game decisions. I wouldn't use those addons.
---
For now I must go through the "awakening" week. Aka, after the first day of exercising, muscles get painful.
---
Only after that week I can see how much I can or cannot.
---
I played at the start of TBC till mid WotLK when I was 7 years old, and I was so addicted that I used to cry when there was server maintenance or something else that prevented me from logging in.
---
My parents had to completely ban me, and even took a video of me crying because there was server downtime and posted in on YouTube (thanks mom). The video got a couple dozen thousand views and then they deleted it.
---
I didn't touch WoW again until Legion, and even though I was young when I played before, I just didn't really feel the magic. I have fond memories of running around the barrens with a Tauren friend and doing quests together, and being excited to hang around the front of orgrimmar to speak to other players. I couldn't find that magic in Legion.
---
 The past year or so, I've been playing on a pserver and I've been having extreme amounts of fun and I love the game.
---
I don't even want to reveal my age when I start playing classic because I feel like a lot of the younger players won't be taken as seriously, I hope it will be different.
---
Here's to all the young(ish) players out there!
---
Sure. But while I respect that stance. I’d argue that the challenges of encouraging an online community now, in 2019, are different than they were in the Vanilla/TBC era. 
---
In that era community was essentially a guarantee, if you created an online space for people. Especially one as focused as World of Warcraft. I remember personally being crazy excited to be able to connect with other actual fantasy/rpg fans, in any context, back then. 
---
So, again, peoples raw enthusiasm and desire to connect in that now bygone era, lead to vibrant communities. Communities where you didn’t really pug raids, even ZG, because your guild had enough people to fill every raid.
---
Now. That just not how it is. Even in a community as focused as this one, we seek to divide and isolate. #nochanges vs #somechanges. #IGuessShardingMayBeANecessaryEvil vs #IAlreadySaidNoChanges. Etc..
---
So, again, different challenge. 
---
If people can’t expect to get a fair chance at dungeon loot, if they’re playing a solo game, then things change. Fast. People join guilds ASAP. Then learn to be part of a community so they don’t get booted. 
---
I completely get your point. But this isn’t Vanilla. It’s classic. People have changed. So, imho, a system that provides a clear incentive for you to be part of a community, is just a positive. 
---
I'm going to be playing both but the best part? Both of them have potential longevity.
---
Ret doing 75% of a fury warrior's DPS sounds very improbable to me tbh.
---
I hope world chat, pug discord’s and reserve runs all make it into classic. I hope Gbid runs die with private servers (unless the gold is evenly distributed to the raid) 
---
I agree that a confirmation window would be enough of a barrier to misclicks. If you fuck it up after that you've only got yourself to blame.
---
ND. Super smooth launch. You can find tons of 8 hour+ videos of uninterrupted, smooth gameplay. 
---
I know 1 smooth server launch with 13k concurrent is different than Blizzard launching a hundred servers with millions of people. If you'd played on other servers, your expectations were ready for tons of crashes and instability but there was little to complain about. 
---
&gt; Valuable BOE drops. Without loot trading, jerk player needs it, drops group and sells it on the AH
---
This has nothing to do with loot trading.
---
I disagree with your examples. You're both trying to extort other players and being very suspicious by rolling on everything. 
---
I don't like Loot Sharing, but if that's a corner which the Dev team has to cut, I'll take it. 
---
An easy fix would be to announce trades of the item to the other people in the group/raid, while it's still tradeable. 
---
You're saying that like it's a good thing. Pressing a macro to reload your UI every so often isn't in not engaging or immersion-enhancing gameplay.
---
It is fun for me and many others to learn stuff about the game I play. It's fine if you don't want to do this. I'm pretty sure there's as big if not bigger crowd that plays the game without doing any type of research on the game.
---
May be it's just me, but I don't like reforged redesigns for Arthas, Uther. They look completely alien for me. They did not just improved polygon count and textures, they redrew them.
---
im 8 yo and im very happy for when classic comes out. i am wanting to play Night Elf Druid with my brother. he wants to play horde though. i dont want to play horde. how can I convince him?
---
When your leveling, if it's an upgrade for you in any way, need it. It's not a big deal it's just leveling gear. I expect the same from others and dont get mad when I loose out on loot.
---
End game unless your a tank or healer and specify reserves loot for off spec etc than you need to be careful. Some brief conversation before the run about loot rules is an easy way to make shure everyone is on the same page throughout the run
---
People who give you shit based on age aren’t people you want to group with anyways. I had a warrior tank come to mc once. He was one of our raiders son if I recall. We couldn’t find a tank so we brought him. He was 12 and was one of the best tanks i saw up to that point. Obviously, don’t go spouting your age to everyone but age is just a number. I know people my age and older who are shit at vanilla. If you’re good you will build a great rep. People will bring you along because they know you know what to do. 
---
Depending on how young you are we will probably figure out you are fairly young on discord depending on your role. Some roles require you to talk during fights. 
---
Be the best you can be at your class and no one will care about your age.
---
What makes you think all young players are impatient? 
---
There was a point between the Wrath greed-only system and personal loot. Logic dictates we will have a system like that. 
---
How is that any help? 99% of the time you didn't accidently hit need for an item. If someone decides to yoink it it will be yoinked. 
---
It doesn’t require reagents anymore does it? I know that is what made most people tip back in the day. At least cover the reagent cost. People should still tip based on you taking time out to help them. 
---
Presumably world chat will at least have a player-run option due to player created channels being global, which is why I mentioned it as a "social change." 
---
&gt;As ret specifically, if you include your Blessings on all targets in your damage output, 75 becomes 85 or 90%, so it's not like you're dead weight if you role ret.
---
And by the way, there's no reason to include blessings in your damage output. Every raid should have at least 4 holy paladins, so all blessings are taken care of by default, regardless of whether you allow a ret to join your raid or not.
---
Flying helped ruin the community aspect. 
---
This is amazing.
---
One thought just suddenly hit me, though. Vanilla is probably the only expansions where you aren't pressured or required to have the latest/most end-game gear to do most content, including said end-game.
---
You can literally keep rolling with full blues and do decent in any role, as long as you cap some basic stats.
---
In retail, especially now, it's near impossible to push current content with mediocre gear and expect to do well. The content is tailored towards heavy power creep gained from 'best in slot gear'.
---
This is also why I still believe that the skill required to do PvE content in Vanilla is higher than in retail. Because the majority of players are averagely geared, they are motivated to push their class as much as possible. Nailing the rotation, picking the most efficient talents etc...
---
I laugh when someone brings out the argument: "In retail you've got advanced boss mechanics where you have to stay out of the fire every 2 seconds and jump like a retard". I mean, if you think that's an indication of skill, I don't even.
---
&gt; I'll take it.
---
It's not like Loot Trading without restrictions would ruin the game, but it's one thing "to take" and then there are a other thing "to take" and one more and one more and suddenly you will start to thing to yourself, is this custom game that cost 160usd/year better than a free to play Private server...
---
play horde
---
That's interesting, I've never heard that mentioned. So you can earn DKP by farming gold, and I assume giving that gold to the guild? 
---
I laughed at my friends in vanilla when i got travel form. One was a warlock and the other a paladin. They got the last laugh.
---
They actually aren't. Young people are just highly adaptable typically. They lack the independent mind of old people (not a jab ... just reality) so they follow the trend and master the trend very fast.
---
Classic wow has it's own meta. This just means that, on average, young people will follow this the obvious meta and master it quickly within that narrow focus first. Young people will quickly adapt to Classic, as they do to most games, and continue to be very vocally annoying about deviating from that meta. lol
---
World Chat. Its like barrens chat globalized, and really nasty sometimes. 
---
Lot of people will probably be surprised trade is the "global" channel. 
---
Wow this is amazing work
---
That Thick Leather tip is fantastic, and I really hope it catches on.  Leatherworkers can use it for free gold, and it will mean that as someone with Skinning but not Leatherworking, I should (in theory) always be able to AH stacks of thick leather for 1g apiece instead of the 60s vendor price.  Kind of a neat win-win there!
---
lol no thanx im not playing with those scum
---
Looks fire. Would use this. 
---
Not all. But a lot of them only have the games they've played so far as reference and if they haven't played any of the older mmo's then the experience is going to be drastically different from what they think an mmo is. I'm hoping there are a lot that stick with it and like it so gaming companies realize how dumb the direction they've been taking is. 
---
No, it’s a pathetic issue, and I don’t play retail 
---
No it won’t 
---
Nah, I won't bother. But I wanted everything to be as close to original as possible, not improved in any way. There are some changes that I could find acceptable, e.g. sound in background, but with mail I don't like it.
---
Need on your role if you need it. If you want dos gear too bring it up. Common courtesy is to ask “do you mind if I roll on it?” If everyone greeds then take it because they don’t need it. But if the warrior dps might need the upgrade always ask first. If you go as healer it’s expected that you will roll on healing gear unless you ask first.
---
Well it's look like a good idea i doubt it'll break authencity since Vanilla wasn't about doing world buff to raid ? 
---
At least this isn't what i remember ?
---
I don’t have an alt account 
---
Is this specifically due to rotation or due to their design as a whole ? 
---
Ooooh, that's a good one! Do an Undead Warrior vs Tauren Warrior please!
---
&gt; im 8 yo
---
It checks out
---
I believe plenty of players will care about bis. Those are the ones that aren’t important. 
---
I'm jealous that you get to experience classic for the first time.  I do wonder how many people will be shocked at how slow vanilla really is.  Eating/Drinking between pulls is quite common.  CC is common, interrupting is a must.  Threat caps your dps.
---
Anyways, I'm excited to play paladin again.
---
ekksdee
---
You mistakenly assume that anyone in the group such as war or rogue wont need on the robe to DE or sell.
---
There’s nothing wrong with reserving the piece of gear you want if you made the group. If people have a problem with it they can make their own groups. Why would anyone put all that work in just to have someone else take the item? 
---
Telling you an item is reserved is a courtesy so you don’t waste time in a dungeon where you aren’t going to get that upgrade you wanted.
---
wow, thats some serious gymnastics going on in your mind.
---
It’s basically a non issue, most players will have fully guild groups. And very few will go to such extravagant lengths over a few blue items from dungeons.
---
This, like many issues, is just an excuse for paranoid conspiracy theorists to feel important 
---
Dude, try to develop that thing. It's awesome! Are you into programming? 
---
 Believe the system works by having raiders bid on the item and the 'winner' pays the raid lead. At the end of the night the gold is distributed among the raiders.
---
&gt; The community will fix it?
---
I, for one, will be playing a Warrior eager to tank dungeons.  If I see any of this shit going on in my groups, I'll pull the "Tank Diva" card hella fast and shut it down.
---
I'd advise any other tanks or healers out there to do the same.  No loot trading would be great, but let's assume it will make it in regardless...  So let's shut it down as well as we can.
---
They had a global chat in vanilla tho
---
Vanilla players were trying till they success no ? Or were they already "skipping difficulty" by doing this ?
---
Talent trees, no. Locking out content? Yes, and they plan on doing that. Everyone's main concern though at this point is if itemization progression will exist. Certain items got buffed through vanilla, and some just weren't there at the beginning (bloodvine set for example, is that gonna be available at the start?) There are lot of questions when it comes to this. The implementation side should be very simple as it's just some SQL database entries. The research side is a bit more complicated since they don't have any official information prior to 1.12.
---
[There you go, buddy.](https://www.neowin.net/news/duke-nukem-forever-fan-gets-swag-for-2001-pre-order/) 
---
I can't understand, they are bad guilds because they don't take buff to "trivialize" the encounters ? Isn't it the opposite ? I'm lost... ?
---
You're gonna have to decide if it is worth it. Warriors have the tools to tank 5 mans just fine without a single point spent in protection. However, prot spec can be fun.
---
Imp Revenge Stuns are great. Imp Shield Bash is awesome in dungeons and even in pvp. Concussion Blow and Last stand are two very nice tricks that nobody expects. 1H Wep Spec is a very nice dps increase, you can switch over to DW for soloing and thanks to that talent be doing some very nice sustained damage. 
---
Sword and board isn't even a bad way to solo. It's pretty easy to gear for it, high survivability, and having easy shield bash before you get pummel can be huge. It's not optimal, but it's not as bad as everybody makes it out to be.
---
Interestingly, Arms and Fury also bring their own flavor to tanking as well. TM in the arms tree opens up stance dancing which can make for flowing between providing extra dps or extra survivability. Fury talents like PH are really good when tanking, and tanking with 5/5 Enrage before you start stacking +def gear is hilarious.
---
If you do choose to go Prot leveling, you could consider dipping into one of the other trees first. Arms up to TM and AM is very helpful, or Fury for at least Crulty, maybe even PH.
---
Nobody said about elwynn forest. They will shard everywhere whenever they want. AQ event will be sharded, for example, unless you strike back now.
---
Definitely includes CRBGs. This is a sure thing. 
---
He speaks for the horde.
---
I’ve never really fallen for this one, I can only see loot trading being an issue in the most fringe circumstances with the most toxic people.
---
Seems like you have to jump through too many hoops to abuse it really making it a non issue to me.
---
It’s really not much more of an issue than regular old ninja looting which, if you play with honest people (and people whom want to protect their reputation) isn’t a huge issue.
---
I never played on a pserver extensively, but I have mixed opinions on this one.
---
On one hand, I can absolutely see how a true 24/7 presence is great if you're trying to do things.  There's always people to group with and stuff to do, and I'm sure it's great!
---
On the other hand, there's something special about being online at 4am in a not-quite-empty world.  Just mindlessly farming or grinding, watching netflix on another monitor, chilling.
---
I agree that it isn’t useless but it is nowhere near as useful as berserking on EVERY fight. I’d also say there are other ways to handle fear on those bosses that WotF on a good player is nowhere near as useful as berserking, though it will make those select situations easier
---
&gt; It is not about Need making BOE items soulbound.
---
That's the bigger problem. If rolling Need on BOE items doesn't make them soulbound, then we are worse off than if we had the loot trading system (which apparently does soulbound boe items on need)
---
Hard to do that as elemental, you really don't have the mana to both heal and dps. If you want to be a healer who brings some extra dps, enhance is basically designed for this since so much of its damage and talents are passive.
---
&gt; Or they can just not roll on it, no loot trading required.
---
But you don't know whether to roll on it or not. Maybe the dps already has the item, or maybe it's not bis. 
---
&gt; if you're not needing on valuable boe's, its your own fault.
---
Code of the Ninja
---
The larger population is definitely a negative of private servers 
---
For 150g I'll roll need despite obviously not needing it and give it to whoever. That's a significant amount of gold. 
---
Ooh, ref pally with wind fury totem :P
---
&gt; He speaks for the horde.
---
Actually I speak for the horde and the vast majority of them don't give a shit about loot trading 
---
As a fan of tanking dungeons, I am 100% planning on leveling arms, running something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdNio0zE0zu0x
---
The lock manages to [dodge](https://youtu.be/qhjsicCeVPw?t=17) his 5 x Combo point Cold Blood Eviscerate lol. And [here](https://youtu.be/qhjsicCeVPw?t=21) the rogue reflects the locks own Death Coil, quite impressively. Very nice 1v1.
---
I like EPL in classic cause they use a lot of the same UD buildings from WC3. To me, it was like I had built them when playing through the campaign as Arthas.
---
So you have a conversation before the timer expires.
---
It is not relevant, as people could do that with the Vanilla style lack of loot trading. The purpose of this post is to point out what bad things could happen which don't already happen with the proposed changes.
---
I don’t think it will piss off the pserver community. We only needed high pop cuz of all regions playing on one server. In classic I expect we will have na, eu, as etc servers so you won’t need to have a 10k pop server.
---
Don't forget parry. Parry is a great way to help survive, and increase DPS through parry haste IIRC.
---
Another point is that areas are rarely empty. You want to quest in the barrens, be prepared to group up with 5 people and camp the spawns of quest enemies because all the time is peak hours.  And ah prices are super low all the time, where you can normally get a decent price on low level herbs, they will often sell for about vendor price. 
---
But it also means that it is easy to get dungeons going, you constantly see people looking for dungeons. 
---
A few reasons:
---
1. Think about the classic wow panel at blizzcon. They spoke of the technical details of bringing it back and some of the obstacles that needed to be overcome. And then, kinda out of nowhere, they bring up loot trading. Why? Why introduce a mechanic that is not in classic so early in the development? Because if they hadn't, and it was found out about during testing, the uproar would have affected subscribers. Instead, they announce it now and let us "get it out of our system", so to speak, with every intention of keeping this in at launch. 
---
2. As I spoke of during the main post, this will save them so much money. Quick math: minimum amount to pay a full-time customer service rep, if in California, is $22,880 a year. That's equal to over 1500 subscribers per month. Multiply that by however many GMs that need to be hired to deal with loot issues and the like, let's say minimum, 100 (if this game gets 1,000,000 new subscribers, and that seems low, that's 1 rep for every 10,000 players). Total now is $2,280,000 which equals 152,000 monthly subscribers. Even slightly denting that number is worthwhile to try. The largest expense for virtually all companies is employees and Activision/Blizzard will do already anything to keep that cost as low as possible. 
---
Usually role for gear that your currently performing. Just let the group know ahead of time if your going to roll on off spec gear. 
---
Debatable 
---
That is also a possible solution. But that doesn't always happen.
---
If you roll need for your off-spec, win an item, and it's bis for the dps'er, suddenly he has motivation to let you know. 
---
Reserve runs were incredibly common in actual vanilla. I have never even played on pservers and I have done hundreds of instance runs with a reserved item or items. Most people who did not reserve items just did it via not inviting anyone else to compete for it, which is just a slower way to make groups. Different method, same outcome, slower groups. 
---
There often isn't "best item possible", it's more along the lines of BIS options.  Vanilla just doesn't have that linear gear progression of the same stats but slightly higher.
---
You COULD have a complete gearset for specific specs as BIS, but per piece isn't perfect.  So "alternatives" are not until you get BIS, it's that they could very well be BIS for you.
---
You're describing BIS of later expansions.
---
Its a non player interactive "MMO" meaning you could literally play the game up until mythics or 10+ dungeons and not talk interact with anyone.
---
Queue into random people NOT from your server. So who gives a fuck? Loots all RNG anyway.
---
The only interaction we get now a days is when using LFR(looking for retards)  when you get a piece of loot from the massive RNG table and then someone whispers you "NEED?? XD"
---
i guess its better then nothing at all.. nothin at all... feels like i wearing nothing at all!
---
i will and join ur guild
---
Yeah... I know the mana/cast time thing etc etc, but I still think chargers are the coolest mounts.
---
LFG was global during Vanilla (up until some time during 1.11, it didn't require a client update so there are no patch notes on the specifics, and it was often underutilized for that reason) but it was zone-only during 1.12, which is what makes it a contentious feature for Classic. 
---
Though I was referring to a global player-created chat channel specifically in my title, which have existed forever. 
---
You should seek help, I'm sure the act of pretending to be something you're not online all the time is the symptom of at least one psychological problem.
---
hey, thanks a lot! :) yup, I post all my stuff here: https://www.artstation.com/dlikt
---
There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that it wasn't a common practice during vanilla. 
---
I'm 16 and still in HS, but I'm stoked for Classic.
---
Used to watch my Dad play Vanilla as a little little kid, then I started playing late TBC. From then on I had a love for the game until WoD came out. Then I drifted away and found pservers.
---
From there I decided to play Vanilla as I never got to actually play it, just watch it. Started on Nostalrius, and loved every minute of it until it was shutdown. Now I intend on playing the shi*t out of the soon to be released state-sponsored Classic.
---
lul
---
Kidnapping a flight master with a Hunter and using Mind Control to heal it and keep it alive. Normally requires a group to get in and get out. My guild kidnapped the Org FM for hours, one guy with a second account (PVP server) made a lookalike with almost the same name to stand in his place.
---
Note: GMs do not like this. When we stole the Org FM a GM eventually despawned him and warned that we could be banned for doing it again. Absolutely worth it though.
---
This, one of the major p servers buffed mc and gave it crazy resistance and it slowed down first clear by 2 weeks or so. And this was simulating early wow. Early raids will always be a joke regardless of debuff limits

---
Great job! It looks incredible, are you planning to make bis list for bg’s too?
---
Can we expect a classic ready launch?
---
It’s offset by the lack of downtime and improved kill speed. 
---
It wasn’t but it will be this time. 
---
Didn't think of it that way tbh. Everyone makes it sound like teamwork is required in every aspect, but im sure a lot of those people from around back in the day will just blow past it I guess.
---
Teldrasil, darnassus, stormwind, stv, boss room music change in mc.
---
What is the link?
---
if a healer needed for an offspec bop he's a ninja. why would ninjas use loot trading to give it back?
---
I think if they will start with 1.12.1 items it will  be super easy, the debuff cap will also make it easier and the talents are from like 2 years after the raid was added so.
---
These factors does the make the raid easier
---
Corner the devilsaur set market and gg.
---
1. I think that Blizzard was trying to identify "problems" with Classic, including launch (sharding), content releases, and customer support (loot sharing). I think it's entirely possible, in fact just as possible that the reason we only got word of this change at Blizzcon was because they weren't thinking about it seriously until that point. They tossed around a few solutions at Blizzcon that may well not be implemented, hence why that was all under the "tentative" section of the panel. They've repeatedly reminded us that they want community feedback and the latest blue post has shown that they're listening to us. I see no reason why we should give up trying to convince them that loot sharing is bad for the game just because it was suggested at Blizzcon. 
---
2. They don't need to answer loot dispute tickets. Imagine how much easier, and hence **cost-effective** it would be for them to just not go through the trouble of implementing the change and making a rule that all loot is final. I, among many others in this subreddit and the official forums, believe this to be the best course of action. It would literally be even more profitable to not have loot sharing.
---
Boo! Me no like maths. Maths bad! Me like video games and hot pockets. Zug Zug
---
PLEASE make this!! I would use it for sure!  If theres a way to let me know when its released, please do!
---
Axes are hardly tough to come by as a leveling warrior bro.
---
Mostly because they lack the key abilities of the pure classes like rogues, priests and warriors have. As a bear you can't get def capped and you have no shield block, but you do a buttload of threat so if the healers can handle it you are an amazing MT. Feral cats don't scale with weapon damage and more importantly weapon skill. Boomkins run out of mana real fast. 
---
Resto is good but very hard to play well. Their direct heals are less efficient than other healers and their heals over time don't stack with other druids and their heal per mana (hpm) is really bad. 
---
They can do some awesome things though. Spamming max rank regrowths is the highest heal per second (hps) in the game, but incredibly expensive on mana, very useful on fights like Vael where you have infinite mana. They also have an instant heal cooldown which helps for oh shit moments. Innervates are useful, especially for horde since they have no paladins. They also bring combat ress and a feral dps can switch to bear and sorta tank the boss for a while. 
---
So they really are a jack of all trades, master of none and that's why there are so few druids nowadays on private servers. People are so focused on the dps/healing meters and druids rarely do well on any of them. Still, we raid with a feral tank, boomkin, protection paladin, retris etc. If the players are good then you don't really need to be autistic about the less viable specs. 
---
Lastly, everything above is only for PvE raiding. In PvP the druid is amazing. As a flagrunner in WSG, supporting rogues who ninja cap flags in AB and being near impossible to gank in wPvP. 
---
I'm just beyond happy that I only have to play in my region (USA). Some of the other gaming cultures of the world seems to be much different than what I have come to learn as normal. Plus having a regular timetable for server activity is a plus. No more 24/7 server active. There was never a good time to farm or grind. Now I can wake up or stay up till certain times to make use of the lower population during off hours
---
As someone who never played endgame vanilla, can you put "1,000 DPS" into context for me?  What kind of numbers would endgame Fury Wars, Mages, or normal ranged Hunters put out?
---
I hardly raided, but 5 man dungeons, vast amounts of world pvp and bg's, I don't regret going ret. In raids I had to heal though lol
---
2-4 months. Bulk of people who start on launch will be hitting 60 around that time.
---
In Vanilla, you talked before rolling, even sometimes at the beginning of the dungeon, and it went fine. No loot trading required. Specially since how loot trading can be abused.
---
Maraudon entrance is easy to navigate until you die. Every crystal is fucking white when you're a ghost. At least Blizzard taught me to respect color blind people.
---
I hate all these threads. 
---
If you solo pug with a guild group, you take on the risk of getting ganged up on rolls. It might happen, it might not. 
---
You can’t do Vanilla content solo, so you’ll be in a guild anyway — run with them, or risk having a lower percentage on gear. Not to mention, once you’re screwed over, you can come to reddit to make a whine thread like this one and all other like-minded players can avoid the people who “victimized” you.
---
Great work.  Thank u for this 
---
&gt; Be the best you can be at your class and no one will care about your age.

Hear, hear!  I'll be 31 in April, and I won't lie that when I hear a young voice on Discord there are certain assumptions that can come along with it.  But after playing Overwatch at a high-ish rank (~3750-4k SR), I've also found that the younger folks who take the game seriously can be some of the best teammates around.  Of course you'll occasionally run across some obnoxious kids, but when it's a young person who is clearly there to play the game and try to win, I have a ton of respect for them and it's always a great experience, win or lose.
---
From experience. Mobile users will prefer it if your stages are radio buttons rather than a dropdown. Easier to navigate with raido buttons rather than a dropdown.
---
There will always be people complaining but that will be a whiny minority.
---
6 hours after post is made it has currently 83 upvotes and 58 comments, in a sub of over 50k people.
---
Couldn't Blizzard argue you're the whiney minority?
---
Loot trading fixed misclicking need on items. The number of times that is going to be beneficial vs the times it's abused in a community based game- it'll sort itself out. Ninja guilds/looters will be known pretty quick
---
Oh come on, im 27 im not THAT old.
---
You're right, everyone playing Classic will be seasoned jaded assholes.
---
It’s just that there’s more skinners than LW, so it’s typically a race to the bottom with the skins because the market is flooded.  
---
That makes sense, one of the things he tends to say very often is "if I recall correctly"...
---
I think people like his storytelling, though.
---
holy shit this is so true for me too. I also remember the first time i realized that a building in Ratchet is the goblin alchemist from WC2/3!!!
---
I would have never gotten hooked on WoW if i wasn't such a fan of the rts games.
---
I think they try hard mentality and toxic elitism at 60 will kill Classic for most people as it did in Vanilla.
---
The point is the system is bad either way. That war needs the robe to vendor or DE or give to his buddy... its retarded to make a change that is just as broken as what you are changing it from.
---
I agree with this.  Having said that, I also think it's good etiquette just to mention it before the run starts.  *"Hey guys, happy to tank this run, but FYI I'm leveling as Arms and will also be needing on the 2-hander that might drop."*  Nothing wrong with that, and it sets the right expectation right up front.
---
This is some spicy new copy pasta
---
There will be many negatives I’m sure, but just because one thing might be a problem, does that mean we shouldn’t discuss other things also being a problem?
---
Everything thats an upgrade for me either in leveling or healing, if people don't like it, I add them to my blacklist and they can have that much harder of a time finding a healer or tank.
---
I'm excited for the youngins, I was 16 when I was playing Vanilla. While I don't expect the exact experience to be created, I'm hell excited to play it again, and excited for all those who never played, or were simply too young (or maybe didn't exists lol). 
---
It'll be a different experience this time around, but that's not a bad thing. I reckon with the resources available now, the young players of classic will likely be more capable than I was back in the day.
---
That makes sense.  But assuming that LW can make *guaranteed* cash as long as the stacks are less than 1.2g, there's no reason a savvy Skinner wouldn't post all his stacks at 1g apiece instead of the 60s vendor price.  And there's no reason a savvy LW'er wouldn't buy any stack of it that's cheap enough.  Both parties make money off of that for almost no real effort.
---
It's really not bad at all. Anytime there was 4-5k online it was busy but not overwhelming.
---
Then again I'm more than down to do 2.5k, I just absolutley do not want it to be a mega server 10k+ now that is a NIGHTMARE :p
---
What are these?!
---
Your statement of your age really makes me feel like I'm entering my midlife crisis.
---
I'm 29...
---
How is this useful? My understanding from the Blizzcon presentation was that they only have a 1.12 DB, meaning we won't have progressive itemization, all items will start with their 1.12 values.
---
This is amazing! Dedication to Classic like this is what makes the game so awesome. I would totally spend a buck or two on this!
---
So if you just ran through a low instance everyone would perish fairly fast with that setup.
---
Thank you! This is exactly how I feel about it, and how I wish more people would lol.
---
Well said, I see a lot of anger towards the reserve run, but this is a balanced view. If you honest and upfront about it, let the potential members of the group make the decision if they want to be a part of it or not. 
---
I'm playing a Paladin too and while leveling, I'll be needing on dps gear and only taking spell gear for healing if nobody needs it.  Obviously Need on plate spell power gear.
---
You won't need good gear for healing dungeons while leveling, might as well pass them to the clothies.
---
Speaking of eating and drinking frequently... to the new vanilla players be mindful that while sitting you have a 100% chance to be crit when hit from behind.
---
True, I just like how I can be farming in the world and look for a group at the same time, instead of just sitting around doing nothing in Org or IF
---
Vanilla bear tanks had one fatal flaw: Swipe only hits 3 targets, this was changed in later expansions to hit everything nearby, but in vanilla that 3 hit limit can be a killer.
---
Keep pushing through your DOMS. Working out will relieve it. Definitely pick a beginner plan from /r/fitness like Bael said. Best of luck on your new adventure!
---
He's from Romania.
---
Some of you are absolutely insane. "Strike back now" like this is a life or death situation, even though the developers have explicitly said that anything which the players compete for (including resources and world bosses) will not be sharded, as it's "antithetical to the concept of a cohesive Classic community".
---
Never use thunderclap while tanking, it costs 20 rage, can only be used in Battle Stance, so you dont get the threat generation from the minimal amount of damage, and again, it costs 20 rage. Warrior could establish some AOE threat using Battle Shout at the start, and applying demoralizing shout, then tab target sunders onto everything.
---
Another way to get some good aoe aggro is to stance dance, charge with battle stance with a strong 2h equipped, swap to beserker stance, use whirlwind, swap to 1h + Shield, and go into prot and proceed to sunder everything.
---
No matter how many years go by too
---
Hate both of those places
---
I played back in 2006-2007 when I was in 5th grade with a couple of buddies, I can’t wait to be overflowed with nostalgia, I only made it to level 36 on a dwarf warrior and I had just managed my whirlwind axe. Around this time burning crusade was about to drop and I unfortunately couldn’t afford membership so only 4 levels away from my dream of having a mount, I was cut short. So I’m honestly most excited to finally make it to 40, save up enough gold and get a mount. 
---
I hate you
---
there isn't gonna be time to play both if classic comes out first, I might not even buy it which sucks cause I loved wc3 so much. It would be smart if wc3r came out like 1 month before classic to fill the void
---
Is 22 young in the classic sphere? 1996 baby. 
---
You're only as old as you feel!
---
Dude I was watching my dad play and he sometimes would let me play on his hunter and I was just having fun exploring sometimes he'd let me play some bgs but most of the times I was fighting mobs because I wasn't using WASD, I was using the arrows with the right hand so I couldn't hold the mouse and move at the same time.
---
Oh and there was a time when he was raiding on his druid, and he let me a couple of seconds on the pc. The thing is, he was a healer and of course I didn't know raid roles and other stuff so I just switched to bear form cuz I liked it and I started agroing mobs around trolololol
---
While leveling, the dungeon "healer" is not a healer, he's a dps throwing out some heals.  Can't heal a mob to death.
---
piss off
---
Its a common way for paladins to aoe farm stuff, add blessing of sanctuary for the damage when blocking, and holy shield to increase block chance and do more damage when blocking, then use consecrate you've got a nice 300+ aoe tick going.
---
That’s ....actually a really good point. 
---
they said they only have data for the 1.12 client, they never mentioned databases.
---
I looked it up
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18326
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=12631
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=12632
---
You think they don't have the older clients, but they do have the older DBs?
---
I know
---
P.S: where are you from? 
---
why wouldn't they? most of that stuff is available online.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I guess you can look at it like that, but buffs are a vital part of hybrid classes. In TBC you see this more, where Warriors and rogues are incredible buff recipients, they don't provide incredible buffs to their team, but use them well, and hybrid classes don't do as much damage, but their buffs make them well worth bringing, even if they do 85% of a pure's dps.
---
I don't see why you would apply a seperate mentality between the two, if you understand the math behind it. Sure, every raid should max blessings, but I'd count those blessings, even on the holy paladins, as damage caused by the paladin, not the warriors or rogues. 
---
True.  Ironically, prot paladins aoe grinding will use this to stack reckoning!
---
You could be passed your mid-life already
---
I was thinking I would be okay if they did announce XXX has traded yyyy with ZZZ, only with other players who rolled on that item. 
---
Also would be 100% acceptable if it was only for master looted items. for a need roll they can have that popup saying looting this will bind it to you please confirm.
---
Depends on the fight, player, and situation. Either way ret meets the dps checks if its played well. 
---
&gt;Retribution Aura 112 Holy Damage Paladin
---
What? that aint vanilla, most ret aura did in vanilla was 30, max rank did 20 damage and an additional 10 if you had the talent. No amount of spell power in vanilla would get that to 112
---
I don’t think he was implying that there’s a negative connotation with doing research. Just that it’s a lot more readily available. We had thottbot back in the day with items and where they drop and best specs, but it wasn’t a hugely used source and didn’t have thorough guides on rotations, stat priority, etc.
---
What it comes down to is a huge part of WoW’s vanilla social structure was based on ignorance. The best way to get information was to talk to other people. Now you can just look it up yourself. This is why you had hunters running around in spirit or int  gear. Will that still happen? I’m sure. But not nearly as commonly as it did.
---
Loot reservation is going to be a really annoying one.
---
I've never participated in it on retail, but clearly with how often you see it in trade chat most people clearly arn't as strong willed - I expect them to do the same thing in classic and kowtow to reservation demands.
---
It is sad because the practice would ago away if everyone just grew a set of balls and said "No, fuck you".
---
Bruh, hating on excel for being boring is like hating on pants for not making you laugh.
---
They do their jobs so well, in silence, and we never give them enough praise.
---
Quality work and crucial analysis if you want to min max your mage 👌
---
Until you get a better answer, very quick googling says 700-1k for the top dps in Naxx at the time. 
---
In the case of proc chances, if they don't have the data themselves, then they don't have the data at all. only estimations from unreliable sources. 
---
just noticed the other day while playing a private server was how many people including myself have grey/white haired characters now.
---
This was great info, thanks man 
---
GDKP is a run where you ideally make a raid with 1/3 over geared players (to carry the raid), 1/3 geared players (to pull their weight and bid gold) and 1/3 under geared players (to bid lots of gold because they need more gear). Each player bids on items with gold which they give to the RL, then at the end of the night the RL splits the gold earned for all items with the entire raid.
---
So long as you trust the RL's reputation to not steal all the gold (never happened to me, but obviously it's a possibility) - this allows undergeared players that to start getting raid gear, over geared players that don't need anything to make good money, and unlucky players who need gear but didn't win it (by not bidding enough money) to still get something good out of it. 
---
It is not uncommon that you might end up winning 1 item, and your share for the rest of the raid covers your bid on the item you won - so it is win / win.
---
I do remember the second way, not inviting potential competition
---
Regarding your first point, I do think it's odd that they included loot trading with that panel as something they say they are going to do. Feels out of place and it seems to me that it was planned that way the reasons I described above. 
---
As for point 2, customer service is a fundamental part of every successful MMO. Failing that, customers quit so it's in there best interest to do everything they can (within reason) to keep the customer happy. If they actively ignored all loot disputes, quite a few people will become jaded enough to quit and maybe even quit the entire franchise. That's why blizzard takes customer service so seriously (or at least they used to) and why they recognize that customer service is an integral part of classic wow.
---
If someone abused the loot trading system and it directly effected me, I'd be pretty pissed and even more so if blizzard said that they don't handle these matters. My anger would be redirected to THEM and not the original aggressor. Especially since we all know that they dealt with such issues in the past in a relatively just way. 
---
I for one would prefer no loot trading, but I really think blizzard will keep it in, if for no other reason that Activision will force them to..
---
How about $3.50. God damn lochness monster.
---
Considering how butchered they became in retail, I would be surprised how many people will bitch about them. I loved both the length and maze like design of them. 
---
If in doubt always follow your nose
---
Not everyone is subscribes to all 3 subreddits like me and you &lt;3

Is your intention that this just shows the "final BiS list" or does it sim with your current gear to show what is the best item for you right now (which may not be the same as the end game BiS.)
---
I'd be fine with keeping 1.12 proc rates, they're not really the issue here. The issue is item stats changing to be much much stronger and new strong items added in later patches that are meant as a catch-up mechanism for Naxx. Also, as a software developer for many years I can tell you the chance of them not having database versions prior to 1.12 is close to zero.
---
I hope that there are a lot of you that will get into it. Many people will assume that you'll just cave under the slow pacing and complexity of the classic game, but I know there must be a lot of younger people who will appreciate it. I think the community will need you to thrive.
---
It really is. Josh sounds like a complete pro. It’s very well done
---
They are using the 1.12 client as code reference (mechanic, fixes and such), but the content and itemization is going to be progressive, don't think they're going to do it as you think.
---
The best solution I've seen is to simply allow 1-2 hour loot trading when master loot is in play, but not when using the need/greed system.
---
I have an elliptical and a power rack to work some sets in. I will however have to say goodbye to my friends and family 
---
Pool.  :)
---
I would like BiS to be gone. Now, I know it belongs in Classic, I'm a nochanges dude, but in general, I dislike having BiS items. I'd love for an MMO to individualize gear, such that what I get is not the same someone else can get, thus there will be no online recipe for BiS :) Dreaming here lol

Not really, React Native is more than enough nowadays. The only problem would be paying the $100 dollars fee to upload the app into the iOS store.

But they expect healers to all be holy or Resto. Cry me a fucking river

Fully T3 geared raid buffed, with a good fight / RNG you over 1k is doable, but it is still pretty damn high single target.

Data goes in a database
---
&gt;Definitely pick a beginner plan from   
---
&gt;/r/fitness  
---
&gt; like Bael
---
the beginner's plans feel like real beginner'S plans to me. After the initial week, I think I'll be quite ahead of them, but I'll see. 
---
Anyway, there are also quite technical limitations. If I start going to the gym, I'll be probably the only person in my town, who goes there, and doesn't have a car. That means I have to rely on public transport, which is quite sparse. So, I guess I'll just save my money on gym and bus cards, and stick to exercises at home.
---
I was under the impression parry haste only applied to NPCs, not players?
---
Yep I was that human ret pally. Proud of it. Anyone who didn't like it could kiss my divine ass. Would do it again, if I had the time.
---
Bottom line is all pve content needs a small tuning pass to account for 1.12 itemization &amp; class talents
---
Yup, and I’ll be making lots of groups and denying any competition classes
---
Those windows movie maker graphics
---
From what I remember and I could be wrong is that you get 20% increased attack speed or so after a parry.  
---
Vanilla? Paly with totems?
---
This is the only sensible solution I have ever seen on this topic.
---
Arena??? 
---
I love how classic dungeons actually feel like you're venturing into an unknown and unfamiliar,  dangerous area, instead of just a small soul-less instance like in retail. The buildup of actually seeing the instance from the outside definitely helped build this mysticism as well though.
---
In a raid? Absolutely. But a healer outside of a raid has more options than a prot warr. Pvp is fine and farming is better.
---
Thank you for reminding. When I pick up my emotions, I'll watch all 3 LOTR's.
---
I'd prefer Arctic Ocean, tbh. Pools around here are like 42°C... both natural and artificial.
---
Unless you're talking about the sport ones, but they're still too hot to "refresh".
---
Ya, and 7 days is considered fast by average, even on private servers. Classic, depending on the server, may have some extremely casual rates to 60.
---
I'm actually looking for to this. I did the front line wave to raiding once, and frankly I had little enjoyment in it.
---
Expect the AH to have primary stat gear selling for a lot of money comparatively due to the overall knowledge of the player base. Sadly this also means many don't even bother to list some, non-optimized gear at all. Smart players, player agility classes, will look to buy agility cloth for cheap to get rolling. The good news is that early after a fresh launch, trash listings sell well due to the many grinding up enchanting, so this may counter the trend early.
---
Wrath had decent Arena compared to TBC. Still had really bad balance at times, especially early and late.  I think BG's were best in Vanilla though and they got worse every expansion. Healers just got too strong after Vanilla due to having to survive Rogue/Mage comp CC chains. So they buffed healers and ended up giving everyone similar CC and that is another thing that makes BG's kind of bad now.  All these steps were logical and had to be done, but it's just not "fun" anymore past 3 v3. PvP falls apart.
---
WOTLK Classic would be a big hit with streamers though because of hard modes and Arena. WOTLK was the best "minigame" expansion because I think it hit every demographic pretty well. Wintergrasp did an "ok" job scratching the itch of old AV, hard modes made the "elitist jerks" happy raid accessibility and wintergrasp introducing people to raiding made the casuals happy, without having to destroy the community with LFR and arena made the wannabe esport people happy.
---
I still prefer Classic and I would say MOP and parts of Cata did Arena better, but WOTLK was passable. You couldn't include the dungeon finder part though. It's what destroyed the community overnight. Arena will always fail in WoW and hurts the game imo. It should be a separate minigame/tournament servers with Cata/Mop rulesets. Most Arena players will tell you MOP and Cata were their favorites (depending on class). Fine tune that and have seasons and make it F2P. Sell transmog gear or allow a sub to use transmog gear to finance the modern MMO part.   
---
I mean I'm obviously not in charge of Blizzard but I would soft reboot Vanilla and do a tournament realm. As far as hardcore PVE I would be doing that with the new Diablo game. These esports simply don't work with a MMO. Hardcore PVE will NEVER be watchable unless it's more random. In a top down smaller scale MMO procedural instances is probably possible. Make them random and have the teams play those same random instances so that we could see strategy on the fly. Not just repetition. That is what a PVE competition should really boil down to imo. Communication, tactics that are formed under pressure and random enemies and pats so that people can't cheese things with FOTM classes.
---
Here's a great compromise on loot trading and GM resources. When an item is Master Looted, the receiver must confirm that the item is being given to them. 
---
Problem solved. There is now two factor confirmation during the transaction that two separate people need to agree to. Don't give an option to contact a GM about an item to be traded and set a precedence that GMs won't get involved in such matters. 
---
Druid here. I know Sunken Temple by heart, just I never remember the order of bosses.
---
About Maraudon, I know it even better by heart, but I keep making one stupid mistake all the time.
---
St I don’t remember as much as Mara, but I could easily navigate Mara right now and I don’t play private servers. Two sides that connect, staff quest to meet in the middle and skip the beginning half. You can backtrack instead of jumping down and kill the keeper boss easily. After killing princess jump down for the alligator and leather boots. 
---
yes, I always had to turn off that "Death Effect".
---
When I was deep into that level range, I even made a macro that turns it off.
---
Reserving was very much a real thing back in vanilla too. I did it, as did many others.
---
Vanilla will never be "hard" again because we all know everything about the game.
---
Increasing boss health won't make it harder, it will just make it take longer to kill. Do you really want an extra 15 minutes of MC every week?
---
It is a blatant repost, which is also clearly against the subreddit rules, regardless of if you agree with him.
---
 #nochanges
---
22 here. Started during Wrath and enjoyed the game, with decreasing returns over time, until Legion. I didn't and won't play Battle for Azeroth. Though I don't exactly know what to expect as I didn't play Vanilla, the best parts of WoW to me were the sense of exploration and community, so I am definitely looking forward to playing Classic as those two things were apparently very prominent during Vanilla. 
---
Dwarf priest is what guilds want because of fear ward.
---
The problem with that is that people who aren't using ML may still submit tickets, which means that, at least in Blizzard's eyes, they will still have to expend man hours to combat the issue, whereas there would be no reason for players to submit tickets if any player could just trade loot for 2 hours regardless of the loot mode.
---
While leveling you can roll on healing gear as well as DPS gear. Almost no one levels as a healer, so it is generally accepted that while leveling you are running the dungeon to help you... leveling.
---
I can't believe this haven't been done before considering the amount of pservers that have existed for a decade now. Nicely done though! I will be using this rather than looking around in a document, if you fully release it before Classic that is ;)
---
Depends. For 5 mans, always tanks.  Raids, ranged DPS and healers. Any healer is fine for that. 5 man healers, means not druids.
---
Master Loot does that by default. When you go to assign loot to someone it pops up a confirmation box with the player's name on it.
---
Where you a rogue "Rat"? or similar? I played back in 2004-2007 ish. My in game name was Maraberd, human paladin. Was just looking at maybe getting back into it. I remember a lot of people from then.. good times. 
---
well obviously i executed it and have no rage!
---
Depends if you wanna hit 60 1 year after release. You can level as resto but it will be slow as crazy.
---
Dungeons dont give any crazy XP like they do in modern wow.
---
ofc i wasnt talking about leveling. noone sane is gonna be leveling in a healspec.
---
ELI 5: you could take a rocket ship to Circle K on the corner instead of a car, but it’s overkill 
---
Hey guys lets make an MMO where many items completely change multiple times during course of the game, so for every item that drops you need to install an addon/look up on a website that tells you exactly what all those changes in the future will be so you don't accidentally sell or delete something that becomes valuable later on. Yup sounds great.
---
oh really?
---
Wow, really impressive! Can't wait to dive into this.
---
a bunch of BoE blues are low percentage drops on pain in the ass mobs. Hands of Power comes to mind. I know I'll be composing my groups very carefully to avoid this loot trading abuse nonsense.
---
SUFFOCATION
---
NO BREATHING
---
DONT GIVE A FUCK IF I CUT MY ARM BLEEDING
---
Its gonna be 1.12.1 with all quests and items and talent points.
---
And vanilla raids are easy even with earlier patches. Vanilla was hard back in the days because people where really bad at the game.
---
the problem is not tuning the raids or dungeons, its that loot from mc/ony and partly bwl becomes obsolete with stuff like turban.
---
5 mans nobody cares either way I give you that. Easy raids like UBRS I’ve seen shit geared warrior fresh 60 non prot trying to tank and expecting healers to cover for his shitness. Warriors making the “I don’t need to be prot but you need to be Resto/Holy” attitude is very pervasive 
---
I think more people would be upset about loot trading abuse than ninja looters. Ninjas already existed in the game and the absolute vast majority of people never put in tickets for loot disputes (correct me if I'm wrong there, but I literally didn't even know those kinds of tickets existed before the panel). I think the players should take the responsibility of looting upon themselves and justly punish those who abuse the system as a community.
---
While this topic is interesting, it's chewed to death now. If you are a greedy scammer you will always have options, if you are a decent guy too. 
---
You could lootmaster, roll need on all boes or just run with trustworthy dudes, roll last etc.
---
Just work the system if they don't change it.
---
Going Dwarf means you're not trying to be a tryhard lolret, since the human weapon skill bonus the only reason you'd want Human over Dwarf. Stoneform is infinitely more useful.
---
Yeah Mara is nowhere near as bad as ST 
---
pretty big if true
---
mara scepter runs are great
---
but a full mara clear? fuck that

Most online communities are like that unfortunately.  It's why I don't play league of legends anymore.

Lol, good. I'm ok with not having 10 players for every 1 mob spawn. 
---
If this becomes "meta" the community can solve the issue then by having master loot runs where the tank or someone reputable within the community forms the group and hosts the run and makes sure this doesnt happen in pugs...
---
You can also form your own groups and invite people who wont do this.
---
I dont see how this is any more of a problem than people who get mad at people who make runs "reserving" gear. Like this is such a nonissue that people are blowing out of proportion.
---
Just as someone else mentioned this didnt kill wrath &gt; retail and on those servers it was a WAY WAY WAY bigger issue and more prevalent bc of RDF and the cross realm anonymity of never seeing another player again. 
---
Y'all need to chill out over such small non issues.
---
Ah I clicked on this thinking "w00t did Blizz give us an update about itemization?! ahh no.." Still cool update nonetheless. Keep up the great work!
---
BiS for *what*, though?  There are BiS items for a given spec, in a given situation (40 man raid, 5 man dungeon, PvP, soloing, etc).
---
There is no such thing as "This item is literally the best item for this class and spec, period" until we get to Naxx items, and even *then*, there are exceptions.
---
Here is a [tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7kv6d/tip_for_getting_your_lesser_magic_wand_quickly/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) I ran across a while back, never tested it myself yet.
---
Ok then 
---
that movie is hot garbage
---
I agree. I was in a pretty hardcore raiding guild and never once did I see a piece of gear go to the wrong person by mistake. But, blizzard obviously knows the stats better then anyone else and if they say it's a problem, then I'd be prone to agree with them. 
---
LOL this made me shoot coffee out my nose. Good morning and thank you sir
---
DONT TEASE us like that. Be careful using the words update and progressive itemization in the same sentence!!!
---
Seriously though, I forgot about this tool and I remember seeing your original post. Glad its coming along nicely! Wonder how blizz will do it and if we will have to be deleting our cache folders and such like we do on pserver. They definitely need to do something because having full loot changes out from the start would make a lot of stuff obsolete 
---
Like everyone has allready said, just keep it as it was and GM dont intervene. 
---
One of the few things that is actually not hard, and just that simple.
---
Can you chuck me a link to these videos of skilled/geared players enjoying authentic world pvp? Because in vanilla once people got raiding there was very little to ever do anything outside of a city except travel to raids. Every vanilla 'world pvp' video was just ganking undergeared people in pve specs and trying to take as many on at once as you could. I haven't seen any even of private servers that aren't more of the same. The only thing remotely close was the roaming 5v5 hillsbrad fights that some guys organised in vanilla but I'd hardly call that authentic either.
---
Main problem with paladins is they struggle a lot vs fear, so they're very weak vs both Lock and Spriest. They are strong against the weak classes but it's hard to argue they are a top tier dueller when they can't fight the strong classes.
---
That'll work just fine. Shadow priests can heal without much issue all the way up until Strat
---
This is so sick. Can’t wait for a release. 
---
It was changed in vanilla, I specifically remember because I thought I was hot shit for thinking it and then finding out it didn't work.
---
I've only ever played a trial session during Vanilla/TBC when my dad told me about this game called World of Warcraft, although I only started getting into it during Cata when I was about 11. I'm very hyped for Classic release.
---
Gotcha, I don't remember where it fell after the proc was nerfed if I'm honest.
---
chill out bruh
---
Roll a Hunter. Their BiS gear is always full tier set. 
---
I was too but I chucked my bank at the sand casino, now wow classic is all I have left to look forward to.
---
I think people who never actually played Vanilla or a private server are in for a rude awakening.
---
I attempted a private server a year or two ago. Was in Ragefire Chasm and all of us had poop gear; whites and some greens. Everyone tried to charge in with no plan and we wiped constantly. I was made fun of for trying to plan out CC and tanking strategy. That ended my private server experience; I left the group and never touched the game again. I have no idea how easymode low level dungeons are in retail but those people were not prepared in any way.
---
A parry means you take 0 damage from that hit, and that you do more damage, since you gain parry haste.
---
 I spent 7 hours in ST once.
---
To be fair, the items that do change stats greatly aren't super relevant at the point in the game that they change. They are pretty good catch-up gear for late-server alts. 
---
If you want to hold on to [Omnicast Boots](https://itemization.github.io/1.10/armor/feet/omnicast-boots-11822.html) from the start of the game and somehow don't get t2, t2.5, or bloodvine - that's unfortunate. 
---
Won't say it's at all intuitive, but I don't think it's *too* cumbersome for the gamer moms &amp; pizza dads to understand. Big picture, I personally think it's better for the health of the game. 
---
There's loads of spell damage items that are often given to healers. 
---
!remind me 60 days

How about no loot trading and no GMs? If you’re THAT butthurt that something bad happened, then go to your web browser, log onto blizzards site, and submit a long drawn out complaint. I sure as hell know I won’t be doing that, which is the point.
---
Mauradon at princes while tank get kicked away team need to stop damage until you have aggro again. problem solved.
---
Loving all these tools people are developing for classic. Cheers.  
---
Did it scale well in TBC?
---
&gt;So the devs can as well just restrict loot trading only to raids with master-loot on.
---
This would mean people roll need on items just to sell them on.
---
Anyone could.
---
noooooooooooo because you're describing what retail has, with titanforge , extra stats and sockets. Makes gearing realy solely on RNG!
---
I think it's better for the health of the game if 80% of the lvl 60 blue dungeons set/t1 epics aren't complete garbage. 
---
People would still claim X or Y is best.
---
St is confusing even before going down into that troll pit with the emerald dragon sword. I remember getting lost down there once really bad
---
hey guys lets just ignore itemization and start with 1.12 dungeon loot, who wants upgrades from mc anyway?
---
i’m a dog
---
This is categorically false. It was extremely common on many servers and not on others. That is one of the things about vanilla, each server had its own things. Though the practice of simply not inviting competition for particular items existed literally everywhere and is just essentially silent-reserving. 
---
Just did this with the wife because she never watched any of the LOTR's so Netflix with LOTR Trilogy was where we went. 
---
God that extended version though.. jeesh
---
It'll *only* be a dungeon issue. No sane raid leader is going to give 39 people the option to roll on raid drops.
---
The problem isn't the content being easy with these powerful items; the content is already easy without them. The problem is character progression. When you can easily get blue items from day 1 that won't be replaced until BWL, some of them even not until AQ40, that's bad for the health of the game and bad for character progression. It makes a lot of the MC/BWL loot worthless.
---
Hey guys lets make an MMO where you can easily get blue dungeon items from day 1 that won't be replaced until BWL, some of them even not until AQ40. Sounds great for character progression and the health of the game!
---
Honestly it was never a problem.
---
~12 hours of heaven.
---
he's a ninja if he keeps it. 
---
Why can't a healer roll on an offspec bop if no one else wants it? You should be thankful he's healing so that you could faceroll pew-pew
---
When we finished on the 4th or 5th night of watching she was like "longest movie of my life" and yet I was so proud.. haha
---
I was looking at that
---
I think I got lost once or twice, but I could navigate it now. Though I don’t remember the exact order of the statues offhand. But if we were skipping the statue boss, that place isn’t too bad
---
I used to raid in vanilla when I was in high school but just didn’t have time to accomplish all the in game things I wanted to. I used to always think how once I was old and retired I could finally play vanilla again, raid with top guilds that require perfect attendance and performance, grind out all the consumables I could ever need, try and push rank 14, level 60s of all classes. 
---
Funny to see how 15 years later that thought I had as a 15 year old isn’t totally that far fetched. I still don’t know if I’d ever get bored of this game and that’s pretty amazing. 
---
I would argue that across all servers, it was still uncommon. Any server that wasn't high pop wouldn't be able to do it because it already takes so long to find groups on a 1500 person peak server, and I can't think of any high pop servers where it was common either. 
---
Practically every meme spec can reach 1k dps with full buffs/consumes.
---
I remember doing RFC in BC and it was pretty easy as long as you planned things out.  Key word there, planned.  From what I've heard retail 5 mans don't require that at all so people never learn how to do it.
---
troll&gt;ud
---
I'm curious how common of a practice it will end up being. Obviously not a problem on a 12k peak private server, but a 2500 server means you're probably waiting quite a long time for a group. 
---
Theres a big difference between retail (and private servers) and what Classic will probably be. Retail has megaservers, and private servers have extreme overpopulation. It was take a LOT longer to find a proper 5 man on a normal, 2500 person server. 
---
Straight to Video - Mindless Self Indulgence. Obviously.
---
Harry Potter?
---
No one in the right mind wants fucken mc bwl last longer than needed.
---
This whole “i want harder shit, more challenging shit” mentality is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. 
---
The easier the better, the faster the better.
---
Pretty sure lots of pserver-only players are going to find themselves very frustrated/confused upon learning that so much "knowledge" they rely on is not blizzlike.
---
Hahahahahahaha gimme more downvotes
---
I imagine some people will do it all the time and I figure some people, like me, will only do it when there is that one item i've been trying to get forever and I either haven't seen it drop or I keep losing it to other players. 
---
If there is more than one item in a dungeon I need then I don't mind losing one item to someone else as long as they let me have the other. Sharing is caring in classic.
---
I honestly hope to see lots of them come release. I can only assume many players will go druid with it being the most played class in retail. Let's just hope they are good ferals
---
Definitely arms, with a priest you'll easily be able to pull multiple mobs and sweeping strikes them down. 
---
They are also very good in pvp especially in the later levels as you can get imp hamstring and then piercing howl in the fury tree for great CC.
---
Your faith in the stability of the market is adorable.  The truly savvy LW will be watching the race to the bottom and buying out the bottom.  I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops below vendor prices.  Wouldn’t be the first time.  
---
Of all the WoW movies I've ever seen, that was certainly one of them.
---
It'll propably be just Megalomania remixes for 30 minutes.
---
Diablo 2:LOD: i remember dying on my level 98 Frozen Orb Sorc. Dude, ya lose experience points. Ya lose 3-4hours of straight grinding. feelsbadman
---
Full buffed end game fury warrior can pump out 3k+ easy.
---
Seal of command does not proc off extra hits, and its locked to 7 procs per minute, it would suck, it would be better to use righteousness instead.
---
Not sure it has much more PvP advantages if any but it’s doable. The overpower crit talent is lovely. Deep wounds and impale too
---
Just because one show gets a lot of views doesn't mean they don't care about the viewers. That's a completely ridiculous thing to say. We have literally purposely held off on doing ClassiCasts at times, even over a month, because I said I don't want to do a show just for the sake of doing a show whereas we could easily just do a show every week and do it "for the views" like you implied. 
---
But the views are not the point, the point is the content. And if the content is good, then people will enjoy your show, they'll like your channel and they'll watch. Every content creator wants their stuff to get viewed obviously, why would you make it if you didn't want people to see it. Not wanting that would be antithetical to being a content creator in the first place. But to assume just because one gets a lot of views doesn't care about the viewers is absurd, and in this case completely false. You can ask almost anyone in my community that and they'll say the same thing.   
---
The only way this picture would be better is if you used my character on the left, lol

I’m not really selling, I find it very valuable

---
Only way this picture could've been more accurate is if you used my character on the left, lol
---
It's for the different reasons to play now vs then. Most of the time I want a portal, I'm going to run an old raid, it can take a good 10 minutes of running around whispering mages and asking trade and having no luck some days, it's usually not worth bothering and instead I go myself.
---
Better example, I'm on my mage in a queue and I have to turn down people asking for portals because I dont wanna leave a queue I've been in for 20 minutes.
---
Those aren't issues in Classic, and instead its significantly more time consuming to reach places, what is now an inconvenience was back then an RPG element.
---
I hate the new removal of portals because it means doing the Greench dailies during Winter's Veil across 12 toons went from a portal away to flying mount from Ironforge, that's like half an hour of my time wasted, and so I wont bother this year.
---
BTW I am very excited for Classic, and I believe the "inconveniences" are important parts of that game. Its just that they're wildly different games I play for different reasons. RPG Classic and Collect-a-thon Retail.
---
u are not alone i am born in 2010 and will be 13 in two years and played vanilla WoW when it came out im excited bye
---
sure people from private servers will do better than Burning Crusade to Retail normies but pserver people will be in for a very rude awakening. Because pservers devs guess so many gameplay values.
---
I am kind of ashamed that I am advertising my channel so much here, but I don’t know any other way to really build my audience. It’s mainly dungeon quest guides right now, but soon I will be producing other content for Classic. I humbly ask for any advice or support. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the video.
---
That was hotfixed within 24 hours of it being made aware to the mass public, and honestly if they are smart they will keep it hotfixed
---
Id rather not have loot trading or tickets but I’ve said for a while since we’re gonna get it anyways I’d rather it be limited to ML situations.
---
Sounds like I finally have a game plan.
---
Unfortunately Thundefury will mostly be relegated to tank warriors for most guilds
---
Pretty cool, i have to say this is the kind of sutff that makes this community awesone
---
I have a question, are you going to do meme specs (like ret pally, shadow priest, enh shamans) ?
---
Hope you can finish this, as a ps player its always annoying looking those lists
---
Not only that but mail is pretty easy to match when it’s only mail, let alone a paladin in cloth or something of that nature. 
---
That’s a fair point. It’s the reason I mentioned to give each show a listen and let people decide for themselves. Honestly I just love throwing shade your way cause we dropped a game of 3s to you a few months back. I believe you want to help build this community that all love vanilla wow. Maybe you can take a step in that direction and join josh on a countdown to classic episode? Whatcha think?
---
Not if it's simply a loading screen tip that reads:
---
&gt; *Unless you're in Master Looter mode, all loot is final!*
---
ez pz my friend!
---
Huh, I didn't even know that was possible! Interesting. 
---
Idk how much money i did fishing those, pretty cool
---
Oh god lol, but seorusly tho in a way I actually enjoyed parts of it, simply because of the Lord of the Rings soundtrack and the in game sounds.
---
I played through most of vanilla, quit for a few months towards the end and resubbed when TBC came out.
---
I never even knew it was a thing for people to ask a gm to trade loot until reading about it on this forum. No one I knew did it, or if they did they didn't talk about it. Never saw it mentioned in chats. 
---
Just because a small percentage of players abused the gm system doesn't mean it was a thing for the vast majority of vanilla players. 
---
Keep dreamin
---
This mindset really bothers me, "MC will be easy regardless, so there's no point in trying to recreate a more vanilla-like experience."
---
Yes MC will be a faceroll. More knowledgeable players with better performing computers and add-ons will be using 1.12 threat mechanics and talents against the first tier raid. Some things are hard or even impossible to walk back toward the early Vanilla experience.
---
Others aren't. 8 debuffs instead of 16, no DM gear/buffs/enchants, progressive gear itemization. Individually each of these may have a minor impact on difficulty, but they do move things in the right direction (making MC more engaging) in a 'Blizz-like' way.
---
Why shouldn't we expect the same level of effort from Blizzard as shown by pservers?
---
Lf1m VC need tank
---
I have the impression that its mostly Americans who Call Deadmines "VC". On p-servers I have seen people call it VC even in Westfall general chat several month before Dire Maul was even open. That's just messed up and I got very triggered and offended.
---
Ninja-looting is also toxic, and has no place in Classic, yet, it's going to be there.
---
It's right there in the video settings actually. Just untick a box and it's disabled.
---
For me, since night elf was my favourite race, the first time I saw an ancient protector just walking around I was blown away. Game had me hooked for good.
---
So undead priests aswell?
---
I spent a month in ST one afternoon 
---
The best current guides are nearly all created from private server play.
---
Check the largest of the private forums; there are several excellent guides still hosted on the old Nost forums, but also other more recently hosted forums. 
---
Search Youtube and Twitch for private server game play. Those will, on average, show far superior game play and at a higher resolution than original game play.
---
Ensure the information comes mostly from so called "Bliz-like" servers. They attempt to recreated the Classic experience for the most part.
---
&gt;Dire Maul is never, ever called DM by anybody. 
---
It has indeed been called DM.  We use to run 2 of the 3 wings in a single go and typically that was called DM.  Originally all 3 wings joined together for a single dungeon. 
---
Finally someone I can agree with about deadmines and dire maul
---
No doubt there will be a classic equivalent of raidbots.com from day 1
---
Arms is a lot better on multitarget damage, which you should see a lot of while leveling with a group.
---
Its VC to me and has always been that way.
---
It says a lot about how middle of the road Hunters are. 1k DPS with the rarest, most valuable weapon in the entire game *and* full BiS gear isn't great.
---
It's like, less than 50% of an equally geared Warrior. It's a huge discrepancy.
---
Yea I really think they messed up the order with release here.
---
I realize both are completely different games, one being an MMO and the other being an RTS. But I want to replay the WC3 storyline so badly again, but I have done it so many times that I really want to play the reforged version of it.
---
Oh damn, didn't even know that lol (Haven't played retail since WotLK)
---
Hm perhaps. It would have to work a way that wasn't Diablo-esque RNG.
---
Guess it was one of those things I never looked for so I most have glossed over it. Thanks! 
---
I hate ST. Always have, always will.  Place is a maze that I hate every moment of.  That being said, I really learned how to tank well running it with limited to no CC.  
---
F
---
When I was a kid I played c64 and loaded games with a tape cassette.
---
&gt;Ensure the information comes mostly from so called "Bliz-like" servers. They attempt to recreated the Classic experience for the most part.
---
Obviously private servers aren't perfect but they are probably a much better image of classic than vanilla even was, we're looking at a classic with 1.12 talents and possibly itemization, even if you had perfect recall and perfect knowledge of how vanilla was, you would still be wrong when it comes to classic.
---
Great video.  I really enjoy it.
---
Nice i just set up an account and followed you on there! Looking forward to seeing more of you're work :D
---
Deadmines is quite a bit worse for retail players.  I did a run in the early day of one server were a warrior tried to tank and pull without a ranged weapon.  Needless to say lots of wipes and we didn't finish.
---
Trying to tank slimes?
---
Addons was a core feature of Vanilla.
---
Metzen said WC3 and WoW were "basically co-developed". 
---
VC for Deadmines. DM for Dire Maul. 
---
All BiS lists should strive to be like Taladrils druid spreadsheet. 
---
So if an add-on exists that provides a QoL change, it’s okay, but if Blizzard allows people to toggle the exact same QoL change then Classic is ruined? 
---
I'm 19, started in wotlk but been playing almost exclusively on vanilla servers ever since wod. Really hyped for classic although I'll probably have to play alone since my friends would rather play the newest assassins creed, call of duties and battle royale games..
---
I notice a ton of players, so called advanced players, just play with their camera fully panned back and often just directly overhead. This allows them to bind other things to the mouse wheel.
---
There is nothing advanced about it. They aren't skilled enough to adapt their view during game play or adjust enough key mapping to maintain easy camera adjustment. I have capitalized on their limitation many times in pvp.
---
Use something that expands your keybinding options similar to what a MMO mouse can, practice your camera control skills in the middle of combat so you don't have to even think about it. You WILL see and respond to thing faster than players who don't dynamically maximize their virtual sense of surroundings.
---
This is a twitch game play style tip, and the majority of the casual Wow player base won't care or have the skill to benefit from it, so take it for what it's worth. Some people are better at sports just as some are better at gaming, it's a combination of genetics, training and control over your own mind and body. Repetition and dedication is required. 
---
Thankfully the majority of Classic Wow game play isn't that hardcore.
---
Hopefully they block stuff like Deadly Boss Mods or Bigwigs or what ever is popular these days.
---
If you dig a bit around, you can find similar sheets that will also allow you to select gear, enchants, buffs, consumables, etc :) People have used them for years on pservers.
---
While leveling, tanks and healers visit dungeons under the premise that this journey will provide them with items to helps them level up. So you can roll on dps, heal and tank when your tank doesn´t need it. 
---
What no, I'm on a private server and people routinely spam world chat to buy leather stacks at 1.20g each
---
My focus is release oriented.  It does change after the initial wave.  
---
Actually on my private server stacks of thick and rugged go for 1.20g, if not more
---
The way I see it, the retail classic UI should be as it was in vanilla. QoL improvements blizz could make would be minor things such as being able to shift click items to search in AH instead of typing every damn letter.
---
The classic experience for me was having the freedom to play with addons whether it be stupid THIS IS SPARTA quirks or DPS counters.
---
I think the line gets drawn at anything that represents you being a less social QoL such as LFR or LFG addons.
---
It has been given a pass by the "nochanges" people because addons were a big part of vanilla, along with the fact that pretty much everyone will be using addons if Blizzard doesn't restrict them (which they plan to do at an unknown scale), so it doesn't make sense either way that the nochanges community would just stay away from addons while everyone else are using them.
---
The nochanges people have however called for the restriction of many very advanced addons though as far as I know.
---
Where do you stand on something like a quest helper?
---
Yes. Exactly.
---
That’s how it was, that’s how it should be. 
---
No. They don’t have fear ward. 
---
I want to make a lvl 19 NE priest twink, has anyone tried that?
---
&gt; Of course if you convert that to retail $ thats probably like 1000g
---
That's more in the 1-10g range. Flasks on my server are like 800g a piece, for comparison. Although battle pots (which you use 2 per fight, ideally) are 500g each, so it's not exactly comparable to vanilla. 
---
Probably not Lamo
---
Mouse wheel up and down, along with shift and control are key bound to abilities (usually movement or slow orientated). Alt-MW is what I use to zoom in, along with FasterCam or similar Addons to make it zoom much faster. 
---
Uh, why is classic better without, but the later expansions aren't? 
---
I know a lot of reasons not to have flying, but that applies to every expansion the same, not just vanilla. 
---
lol
---
I know it's against the #NoChanges attitude, but it would serve to make content less trivial, and I know even the most hardcore raiders would appreciate not having to collect world buffs every time they raid.  
---
