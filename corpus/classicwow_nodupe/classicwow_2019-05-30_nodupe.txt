I do like talking to people though. I also like lecturing them.

---
---
CONFIRMED hotfix has been applied and this issue has been FIXED thanks Blizzard!
---
As Alliance I feel the same way about Tauren.  We've got no beef with them, pun intended.  They're just so chill.
---
Good hunters definitely can. You can also raid as spriest, mots guilds will allow 1 per raid, so it will be hard... but possible.
---

---
Also about gear, the amount of gear you can get from raids is fairly limited, it's not that much. Though anathema will be neccesary, but that can be bought from guilds fairly early since it stays in the chest and has 50% droprate so priests get it real fast.
---
That simply cannot happen though, the concept of layering will be a reality whether we like it or not. However, they are not done developing the system, so maybe it will be better for release.
---
Ooh, thanks. I actually remember getting one of the black worgs from SFK for the attack speed now.
---
So it sounds like axe spec is indeed better as long as you dont use reck? Perhaps with many proc effects, sword overtakes it?
---
Just casual drunk driving, like it's no big deal.
---
Lol I remember me and my other druid buddy had a 2 v2 arena team named Cup O Mangle. Thanks for the memories 🙂.
---
Lots of people want to make old areas relevant again. I got so bored of BFA I went back and started playing through the expansions I never got to experience. Right now Im in Panda Land and its *gorgeous*. This isn’t what people meant when they said to make the old areas relevant again, buts its fine for me

---
&gt;Three titles that grew the playerbase, rather than greatly shrinking it.
---
Just for accuracy: [Wrath pretty much stopped the prior growth trend.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ibJJaNnI4T0/UyLWBayUk3I/AAAAAAAAFmk/oAvYUpHCQmw/s0/WoW+Subscriber+numbers+001+jim+younkin_b.png)
---
I agree with you about TBC dungeons. Probably my favorite aspect of that expansion. I wouldn't usually advocate for toggleable difficulties in dungeons and raids but TBC heroics *worked*. They were hard enough to be fairly exclusive and provided a ton of content to work through for coordinated players who didn't raid / weren't currently raiding. Their existence meant that pretty much everybody was happy with the 5-mans. One of the few things that I think TBC improved on Vanilla.
---
started between 8th and 9th grade, about 6 months after release, befriended the other nerds that played, my buddy and I were both warriors so we started a guild as main tank and offtank gm/officer type deal, we ended up clearing up to c thun but could never get it down, was hilarious being 13ish n leading 38 other dudes in raids that were decades older than me, id straight boot people for pulling trash, my boy and I would gank all the plate loot, because we were the tanks obviously n we needed gear, was a great time for me in wow, good times.
---
Same
---
If you care about solo pvp then yeah you should probably go orc or tauren. If by pvp you mean battlegrounds then it doesnt matter play whatever you like, trolls will even do 5% more damage to the druid flag carrier.
---
\&gt;Thinking you're an intellectual when in fact you're just a butthurt redditard who's angry that he's not in beta.
---
No. Not as it is right now. And it doesn't need it. It runs really well.
---
This is what I keep getting https://i.imgur.com/mH55qUe.png, Questie was giving me 33 individual errors. Do I need to repair the game?
---
Nostalrius had dynamic respawns and sharding for the starting zones. I destinctly remember getting jebaited by copper veins and getting phased before I could reach it. Nostalrius also did lag on release, and the starting zones were a mess. It solved itself mostly when people actually spread out over the continents, but the phasing remained for the entire part of the servers lifespan.
---
When I arrive in org, or STV, or wherever it needs to be STV, not STV 2 of 3. That's not a 'world', it's a fake experience. I don't care how seemless or unnoticeable it is. I'll know. And I won't want to play.
---
That's not the appeal that made nost so exciting.
---
-------------
---
I get that they want to have higher server populations while still having a viable leveling and resource economy, but layering is not the answer.
---
I want them to release a Classic like server, but for every xpac, that would be awesome. You could re-experience all your favorite expansions, or play through them for the first time!
---
What about the Paladin mount though?
---
Dead since acquisition anyways, might as well make the most of it -
---
\--\_o\_--
---
If only we all crafted such thought provoking posts such as yours. Here's a juicebox kid. Nap time soon.
---
That's like comparing apples and oranges. Compare bear druid with defensive stance warrior and it's at-least comparable.
---
No worries I've been looking through all this debating a hunter alt and making the run to get a lvl 10 owl..just cuz
---
Even when in AV or 25 &amp; 40 man raids?
---
That is what we have been promised, they cannot have 3-5 different world bosses, so by phase 2 the layering will have to be gone.
---
What is wrong with feign death?
---
Costs about the same as locks, there's a part in the quest where they require mats +250g or something. And some mats aren't cheap
---
&gt;So it sounds like axe spec is indeed better as long as you dont use reck? Perhaps with many proc effects, sword overtakes it?
---
It's basically exactly like you say, if you take two characters without any +skill racials then Axe is better unless you have situations like Windfury also being present, HoJ proc, or Bonereaver's Edge proc.
---
Enhancement has no rotation. Storm strike on cooldown (without putting aggro), shock when appropriate. In pve, use frostshock to avoid additional aggro. Don’t overlook fire totems for extra damage.
---
Well, not really. My friend is a noob so i let him park in my garage and i just parked outside.
---
God, the memories!  This was one of my most prized possessions in vanilla.

Hi, /u/setnetjer, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/classicwow) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Their logic is that they "paid for it" 15 years ago and as such they own it or whatever. Completely ignoring that what they paid for and what they're gonna pay for is a time-bound and behavior-bound license granting access to servers.
---
This test wasn't a part of the original test schedule. It was created because the last test didn't test everything they were looking to test. That is why this test exists to fully test the servers because last time they weren't able to
---
Not to mention Orc pet damage racial
---
Doesn't matter what you think, it is a reality. They believe that the server population and/or activity will dip significantly during the first phase of content, so by having layers they will not have to merge depopulated servers.
---
Every character max? God damn even if you were a skilled leveler (average 5-6 days to max) that would still be like 30-40 days played minimum... And he couldn't commit to raiding schedules lol?
---
I'm at work still, but last week it was pretty consistent with all the strawpolls. Warrior/mage/priest were pretty heavily weighted.
---
So, if the top end damage bonus outweighs weapon skill damage bonus, ww axe is probably the clear winner for humans since you dont really have any amazing procs at that lvl.
---
There is a ton of +spelldamage gear in MC and BWL. Deep Earth Spaulders, some tier gear, lots of good stuff in ZG.
---
The fix is to abandon layering.
---
I want to be in a WORLD, not 'The Barrens 2 of 3'
---
Nostalrius did not launch with dynamic spawns or sharding. You can find the news post for when they added dynamic spawns after launch. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
This deserves a sticky, awesome work man ;)
---
So, you were drunk driving
---
You'll be down 1 trinket for 30s and that's if you can swap before you're in combat, worthless as soon as you dismount, but sure if for some reason you're chasing down noobs for hks or you're running from a 'gank squad' (I have never seen groups of people mounted up roaming around together for kills) maybe that 3% mount speed lets you catch up or run away, but in general you don't want to be caught in a fight down 1 Trinket, hence why I said its BiS for long distance travelling where you won't encounter PvP...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It is however useful at the start of BGs as you know where the enemy is and how long it'll take for you to encounter them so you can swap early, lets you get slightly faster caps in AB or better positioning etc.
---
I see some very long answers here. So I'm gonna reply with a shirt one
---
1: you can stuff done in 1-2 hours a day. Wow is as time consuming as you want it to be.
---
2: raids are for most more than 2h. Raiding is not mandatory
---
3: yes, you can play as a fire mage.
---
Jesus this is so accurate :D
---
I disagree. Not on my server. There was several guilds on  Shadow Council. I was in Luna and most of our raiding team had T2 and AQ gear. Then the guild fell apart after a Hunter got Ashkandi. 
---
These players were not rare. They were all over. Clearing Naxx and seeing T3 was a different story. 
---
Point is a lot of redditors here were part of that scene. That does not mean people are full of shit.
---
Aw, world server is down? :(
---
They originally said that they thinking about sharding in the starting zones only. I think that was a way better solution than layering. If servers die out just merge them.
---
IMO, the real way to sustain an MMO while keeping it actually enjoyable is to get players invested in the lore of the game and then have a writing and dev team doing live events.  It's more involved and less brain dead easy than increasing level caps and running a gear treadmill, but that whole "hey do you remember that time" factor would be good at keeping a community invested.
---
I'd say start with a sandbox.  "Start" being the key word here.  Give players a reason to go out and do things.  Player economy maybe, Realm vs Realm PvP, roleplaying tools and player quest creation tools.  Something to make people interact with each other in a world worth doing so in.  Then have some baseline content to work towards.  Dungeons, player homes, crafting, etc.  
---
Once you have that, it comes down to the dynamic content team.  This can range from simple disruption of routine events to GMs possessing NPCs and giving random quests to individual parties or players, to fully scripted server wide events.  When I played Everquest, I remember the GMs dropping an undead army on the doorstep of Freeport, one of the cities.  Even something as simple as that can capture the server's attention and make for some memorable experiences.
---
The key though, is that you keep actual power escalation to a minimum.  One of WoW's greatest failings IMO is that it seems to always feel a need to top itself.  Not just power levels, but the lore itself has ballooned to a caricature of what was already a fairly ridiculous power fantasy of a world.  That doesn't mean a world shouldn't change, but each new threat doesn't have to be bigger and stronger than the last.  It's okay to have falling action that returns things to a semblance of normalcy before the next event.
---
The disc tree is a supplemental tree to pick up nice mana filler talents, other then grabbing PI for your mages you heal the same way a holy priest would
---
..that was known for ever, assuming the group and the person joining are in different layers
---
World server down thanks to Asmongold and his fan bois.
---
Another reason to not like him.
---
Yep seems like it :/ i was just getting familiar with my grp mates F
---
&amp; it won't work. Starting zone is going to be crowded no matter what. Layering includes game altering &amp; ruining side effects too. You all want layering. I don't want to see the reaction when you get it. The entire game will be a cheese / abuse / cheat fest the layering system. It's not even an MMORPG anymore, it's just a layering simulation.
---
So happy for you man! You inspired me to try and get my old vanilla account back. i contacted support and guess what, THEY RECOVERED MY LEGACY ACCOUNT! i cant believe i am playing back on my first toon back from 2006. I feel like im back in my teenage years. My account got hacked and banned back in 2008. i still got my gladiator gear and some blues from TBC [https://imgur.com/2xHh43T](https://imgur.com/2xHh43T)
---
What has it to do with him? Not watching him
---
inviting everybody to his layer
---
I never had any major agro issues on my warrior so it was pretty smooth up until I encountered way too keen dps who ignored markers.
---
I had read the tooltip for taunt and couldn't work it out (I was not a smart 13yr old). The tool tip said it will force the monster to focus on you for a few seconds which confused me as the monster was already attacking me, so it seemed useless, and I couldn't use it to pull as it was a way shorter range than my gun.
---
A 'polite' advised me to use it when he pulled agro on secondary targets.... Right before telling me to delete my account.
---
Lol, no you're not.
---
there would be no subreddit left
---
Be a responsible adult and don't no-life an MMO. This isn't hard. If it's been 14 years of marriage and she doesn't trust you to not be an idiot addict, consider pondering the *why* of that. Beyond that, saying that you want to play the thing to enjoy it should be enough for anyone. If you also haven't worked out in your relationship that you both should be allowed to do things you enjoy solo in 14 years, dude wtf are you doing? I can't fathom having a relationship where my partner berates me for what I enjoy spending my free time with.
---
I was about to turn in a quest to get to level 6.  Was looking forward to it because mobs were hitting my little priest pretty hard @-@;
---
its streamers inviting everybody to the same layer
---
Guilty, for like 10 meters.
---
Yeah someone posted this video earlier and it indeed looks like it works that way in it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI
---
Tried to login a few times starting from 2pm PDT to 3pm, no luck. Didn’t get past the login screen. I’m wondering if it was a smart decision to book vacation days from work for the launch - what if the servers would be as busy as this, and I won’t be able to play?
---
Even if it was seamless, "The Barrens 2 of 3" is not a WORLD. It's the wrong feel, and the wrong solution.
---
Yes. We've seen 80 vs 80 open world pvp in beta and it looks the smoothest WoW has even been at high pop battles.
---
How ironic that the WoW Killer all a long was WoW itself.
---
As long as you are responsible outside of the game, there is no reason you shouldn't be allowed to have free time. Does she not have hobbies or watch the occational movie? I got my current girlfriend into gaming, she is very casual mind you, but I plan on showing her the game I loved many years ago, and hopefully she will fall in love with it too. I dont know what else to tell you, but I hope you figure it out man!
---
Hunter. Can track enemy players, run faster than most and has a pet. Can easily win against less skilled players.
---
Yay, back in :D
---
Blizz found a way to kill classic. It was literally impossible to do, but they did it. Congrats.
---
Ahh kk .. well what can you do.. at least HE can login back already T_T
---
I mean its not his intention but i will avoid streamer servers like crazy. Combine this with him getting back online in seconds and it really sucks

Elwynn forest was so pleasant. General chat with legitimate discussion and them *bam* asmongold calls his flock of idiots to the human starting area.

Then it crashed the area. Nice.
---
weird, I have logged in several time with only small wait.
---
Matter of perspective, as min maxers we play to improve our character and be better than others. Anything to abuse is just more "layers" of stuff for us to do.
---
Since there is a report for spamming, make sure to report players spamming for inv to asmongold layer. its annoying and quite sad
---
Peter Dinklage
---
It didn't go down for us. Maybe different layer.
---
The whole loot system of retail is fucked. It's just so easy to get good gear. The fact that someone can do a mythic+, get a lucky titanforge and have a better weapon than world first raiders just makes no sense at all. That and roll tokens, smh.
---
So I was just looking at my account on the Battle.net website and noticed that it is listing an Active Legion PTR account. Does this mean I've been selected for Beta/Stress Test? I am genuinely curious, as I would assume that the normal PTR would be flagged as being for BfA and not Legion.
---
Including a screenshot to show what I'm referring to:
---
http://i.imgur.com/g1yQluu.jpg
---
I can't wait to say that myself. Words don't do it justice
---
You are actively getting weaker (minus heirlooms) every time you level (as takes more rating to get 1% of a stat) while the world is actually getting stronger (world levels by hard percentages). On top that they tried to "fix" the stat squish issue by tying stuff to iLvl but newer players are just going to sell the more expensive ones which actually hurts them without them knowing. 
---
So let me ask you this... Why even have levels at that point? If you are streamlining the process so the world is always equal to you then having that number is literally pointless. They could take an arbitrary number equal to the number of class ability and make the levels equal to that. At least then you are actively rewarding the player for going up a "level". 
---
My answer to people whining about not seeing the content is... you should have played when it was current or give the players the ability to level at the pace of when that content was current. The real reason they changed it was because it slowed down the level speed and made buying the boost more appealing.
---
Someone with an AoE taunt would be good, like Druid or Warrior.  I'm sure you could find varying levels of effectiveness with most classes.
---
That's great, thanks for all your help :)
---
Server is not down at all.  I guess his layer crashed.  For a ton of us, no crash.   
---
But we didn't ask for inv to his layer.
---
1000 AP seems a little high for that level range, right? The lower the AP the more important the weapon damage in the calculation, making the axe even better.
---
I’m still pissed Age of Conan shit the bed. That game had such a cool world and class system. They basically made everyone a disc priest healing wise and it was super fun.
---
I've never understood the "my old account" posts. I have had the same account since day 1 of playing World of Warcraft. February of 2005. Where do people lose their accounts?
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure classic beta shows as Legion ptr. Grats on your invite.
---
Classic wow can be enjoyed by casual players, it just takes longer to do level and gear. Raids depend on the group and the raid. Some take a couple hours and some take all day. If that's not your thing, there's still dungeons and pvp. As far as mage, you're free to play any spec. You'll just have to mind the resistances of your targets but that shouldn't matter for most dungeons at least. I suggest watching this. It'll help.
---

Even the zones suck for the most part. Its so generic. We’ve seen it a million times. Pandaria looked amazing and I thought Suramar was pretty cool, but everything is so bland now
---
Where are these from? I'm looking for confirmed numbers from the beta, if we don't have any i'll try and throw together a 5 man party tonight and get values for us
---
Suck it up, Hunters are stupid fun.

That beta &amp; stress test is what you are looking for. Your beta has nothing to do with classic
---
i was a typical noob in vanilla (found out i started march 2005!) and my most vivid memories are of being so blown away at a world as massive as azeroth... crossing teldrassil and realizing there were TONS of zones just as big to explore broke my 12-year-old brain. i stepped into lots of dungeons knowing very little about gear stats and put my talents into whatever sounded cool (mained a balance druid cus i loved the way moonkins looked)... i didn't make friends or interact with others much, i just explored and fell in love with the world. i might try raiding this time around and go for a more optimal build, but honestly i'm just hyped to level some characters and relax :^)
---
I wish devs would be this loose and jovial in live as they are in beta
---
Not phase you to different layers randomly. I have a few friends in the closed beta who say it happens every now and then. It's not as bad as people are making it out to be, but it's still annoying and immersion breaking.
---
Final fantasy
---
Yeah but if the weapon skill damage outweighs the normalises damage difference then the opposite is true.
---
The issue with figuring that out though involves working out how often you get glancing blows which changes depending on where you are and what you're fighting.
---
So I guess the real answer is the axe is *probably* better in most cases but maybe not in some.
---
Let me start off by saying that i completely agree with all your opinions. No need to be mad. Let's relax after work.
---
Finantasy.

Esfand ended his stream i gave him subs. Then he hosted alonar and I gifted him subs.   I got stay safe like like 60.  Ching. Tips out.  Which coincidentally I had gifted him subs when he was about to kill the boss and the boss Dropped a rare item and the timing was awesome
---
This. Classic has become a mainstream product so the diehard blizzard fanboys will come here and defend them any chance they can get. This is unhealthy for the game.
---
I mean, MC-bwl-AQ will feel irrelevant if you are raiding naxx.
---
and the 5-man dungeon will have been irrelevant for a very long time at that point
---
Pretty sure these all exist at this patch level.
---
I started WoW blind, as I was playing another mmo up until the day before wow launched.  I started with 4 friends, but one was offline when we wanted to do Wailing Caverns.
---
As a druid I was both the tank and healer in our 4 man wailing caverns.  My friends were a mage, a warlock and a rogue.  We cleared the dungeon.  I was around level 20, the others were 18 or 19.
---
My point is that I agree that the low level dungeons were always super easy.  It gets harder at higher levels, although patch 1.12 is after several big nerfs to dungeons anyway.  In the case of UBRS, it was so much harder when it was a 15 man dungeon.  Imo, Scholo was the hardest dungeon in the game in earlier patches, but it was nerfed heavily before 1.12.
---
If you want hard(er) dungeons then you need to be on a much older patch.
---
Here's to hoping that they can get things and check and establish the feeling of one cohesive world of Warcraft.

STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM

That was a dope guide!  Anything in this format for mages?
---
Yeah i havent played wow in over a year but ill 100% be resubbing for Classic. The social aspects and hard earned achievements are what made it fun, before the days of casino-gameplay and artificially extending playtime
---
I Literally got back in seconds after it crashed. Not a big deal. He also stated he didn't know that's what caused the first server crash, and realized that was the reason for the second crash, so he stopped.
---
Blizzard have their own reasons for not wanting to merge servers to begin with, so that is clearly off the table. Sharding was hated on by the community to such an extend that Blizzard felt the need to develop another system to use in its place. I dont know where you get the "sharding only in starting zones" idea from, that was so early in development, and would probabaly have been "sharding during phase 1".
---
Wait... raids drop loot for every person now?

I ended up donating to a streamer from New Zealand called Cleedos. He actually needs the money to fund himself going to the water polo championships in the world championships so gifted 20 subs and donated $500 to his cause.  Because I know that this money will help him do something that if he doesn’t do he will regret it
---
Wrath is when it became "play the patch" instead of TBC's "play the expansion". It was silly how easy and accessible for example Ulduar was, which rendered basically the whole Tier 7 irrelevant the week it launched
---
Apologies ahead of time for the long post. Also, I'm not sure if it's coherent but here's a mostly streaming thought of consciousness:
---
When Classic was announced I was excited for the community, but I wasn't personally interested. I played \*a lot\* of WoW back in the day, and was active throughout tBC. I visited WotLK and enjoyed it, but by that time it was starting to feel like a substantially different game. I took a break for many years, and in that time I largely saw WoW as a dated game. The new mechanics, cosmetics, and conveniences are cool, but it just wasn't able to hold my attention.
---
My expectations:
---
I believed WoW Classic was simply a response to the vanilla WoW public servers and audience.
---
Vanilla WoW is extremely dated, and so Classic would be as well.
---
Classic would satisfy a different audience. It would appeal to either the most hardcore, or to those who wish to re-live their nostalgia. Maybe it would attract a few current players from the WoW community. I doubted it would pull a new audience.
---
Reality:
---
I got invited to the Classic Beta and I thought I'd load it up. I was mainly curious to see what it was; how many changes had been made and if I'd even enjoy the game. Fast forward a few days and I haven't been able to stop playing it. The game has been SO MUCH FUN. I missed things I either didn't realize I'd miss, or that I was unsure would come back. One of these is the community:
---
* Players have actively helped each other out
---
   * Artisans create bags, weapons, enchantments, etc. for other players, \*often without being asked\*. That this happens in a gaming community in 2019 is somewhat staggering to me.
---
   * Other players help you out in combat and quests. Even if they're just passing by, they'll run over to you, throw you a quick buff, DoT the creature you're fighting, and heal you. They don't do this out of their own gain, for sure, because loot isn't shared in Classic. They do this because they genuinely want to help.
---
   * Players actually talk to each other, because they need one another. They need you to help them complete a dungeon, or an epic questline, or travel to a far away place. Sometimes they ask you to join just for the company. Sometimes they know they can't complete it alone. And sometimes your class has something unique their class doesn't have that will help them succeed.
---
   * Because players have treated you well you feel inclined to return the favor. You start helping others by offering tips, crafting, completing quests, and even more technical things like creating macros for abilities or helping new or rusty players understand the math behind character stats.
---
One of the other things I missed was the challenge:
---
* The lack of Quality of Life automation and convenience, I realized, is intentional good game design. The game is challenging, but it's also rewarding.
---
   * Flight paths are rare, and fast travel is very hard to come by. This highlights unique class abilities like the Warlock Summon and Mage Portal, and suggests that zones are meant to be enjoyed and explored. You're not \*just passing through\*, you're presented with some obstacle you have to overcome.
---
   * Dungeons are significantly more difficult than they are in the recent expansions due to the challenge of having to manually find players, of simply getting there once your group is formed, and the fact that oft-times not everyone is geared very well.
---
   * Gear means something. Good items are hard to come by, and items/abilities aren't scaled. This means that players often have to work together to get upgrades. While this might sound like that the game forces you to be an extrovert, I don't believe that to be true. I believe that it sets expectations and then applies them evenly across the board, and even if you don't like \*having\* to rely on other players, others are there to help you.
---
   * Classes are sought after for their unique abilities. Soulstone, Feign Death, Polymorph, Lay on Hands, Sap, and many, many others are useful again. Hunters are the de facto puller, Warriors the aggressor, Paladins the fail-safe, Mages the water cooler.
---
I'd believed the game was aged, and that I wouldn't enjoy the immersion anymore. However, the world is still surprisingly beautiful and immersive.
---
* The zones are unique, but more importantly they transition into one another. Elwynn gradually becomes Westfall. Wetlands exists because of the dam at Loch Modan. Silverpine is an almost eerie and certainly beautiful country all in the same, and is a great segue from Tirisfal Glades to the Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
* The story is interweaving and continuous, without being bloated and exaggerated. For example, the Defias threat is teased in Elwynn, explored more fully in Westfall, and concluding in Stormwind. The Dark Iron Dwarves have a similar arc, but are evident all the way until Molten Core.
---
* Your class has identity. You are celebrated and antagonized because of your class and (its) ability, and this rings true when interacting with other players. Even if someone genuinely doesn't respect your class, they will still invite you to groups because you \*don't\* compete with them for loot (Hunters being the exception). Generally speaking there is respect, and there is almost always utility in grouping with different classes.
---
* Faction rivalry is a thing. It's important, and the two major factions can't stand each other. Alliance! Horde! The interactions between these two factions in Vanilla was at first mysterious because of the communication barrier, and then violent because of the historical grievances (or just because!). Classic has brought this back.

Can we swap the undead for them?

+1% parry to piss off melee 1% more often

I don't think you even understand what you're even mad about.
---
only hate
---
Then there’s those of us with horrible internet crying coz we have decent pc’s that would be obsolete and unplayable for games on that kind of system.
---
Why would you get downvoted for saying the truth? They add a cash shop, I wouldn't give them another dime, and you are a shitty person if you do so.
---
Where's my night elf mohawk?
---
This is the same nonsense that has been said for years. By buying into this current system of voting, you are putting your stamp of approval on basically what is the illusion of choice. But you do you boo, keep on voting for evil.
---
Sorry dd :(
---
Lmao
---
Yea... I get why people are annoyed at others for bringing up this constantly... but the reality is that blizzard's track record for basically every game they have been running has been completely piss poor. 
---
It isn't like they addressed everything back then either, despite acknowledging them and claiming they are working on fixes.  Many times fixes would be postponed for 2~ years till the next expansion.  
---
Bottom line is that this is a very real, and arguably the biggest concern for most people who are aware of sharding/layering.  Getting phased out sucks ballsack, and while they 'might' fix it.. what if they don't?
---
Have you changed your beta preferences to apply for classic? Everyone i know got invited to stress test at least. Im not sure if you can see the stress test in blizz site
---
Where did I say that they did? I said the starting zones where a mess on launch, which they were. And phasing did REMAIN for the servers entire lifespan (AFTER implementation). My statement is not wrong, you just read it wrong, because you wanted me to be wrong.
---
You can play PS for free. They have no layering / sharding, far better product than Blizz has put out just based on that alone. Plus they're more challenging.
---
Total joke, I don’t think he should leave his wife, the rest of my comment was true though.
---
Honestly, get a new wife
---
I've gotten 15
---
Well actually given the formula you provided we can probably just assume a 5 weap skill difference therefore a 10 percent glance difference right?
---
On a fully 3D multiple player world holy fuck yeah it was.
---
I remember going from EQ2 to WoW and getting double digit fps increases and falling in love.
---
I agree with the other guy, if you have no problem moving your vehicle while drunk, you have no problem driving it. What if there was a kid around your car.
---
Don’t be an idiot
---
I'm going to be playing classic 100%, but I wouldn't call people a delusional idiot then say you are glad to pay for something.
---
&gt; the healer that "let you die" because he was oom when the tank pulled and didn't speak up.  
---
Honestly this is the tanks problem. A healer can say "oom" just as a "hey... before you pull, beware", but a good tank should be watching for their healers mana.  
---
That's how I played anyway.
---
Yeah I updated that months ago.
---
Plus you need active sub for stress test too, right?
---
You can (probably) find a guild that will bring a Ret along - but you'd be in line after DPS Wars for weapons. Paladins bring lots of utility in-general, so guilds will always want 4(ish) of them.
---
Lots of useful pet information for classic over at Petopia. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Yeah, he played often, but had to be on call for his job. Kept getting called in when it was raiding time so he just quit raiding. He could have found a guild that raided during some of his average off hours but he had been with thr guild since everquest, it was a community thing for him.
---
Thanks!  I'll look into it.
---
That I can agree with
---
Thank you :)
---
Ya not years of declining subs... idiot
---
The dude is coming to reddit for marriage advice so I would say the former.
---
I dont play humans in WoW often, but I feel like humans are for the players that wish to see/place themselves in the world, conquering obstacles and whatnot. Also, sword and mace skill?
---
you have 681 fps lol... if there's no cap this always happens on login screens because the frame rate is so ridiculously high
---
Premades back in the day didnt dodge with the regularity pserver players do.
---
I spent 16 hours a day every day in WSG over the summer of 05. We didnt dodge anyone. 
---
After 12 hours of shitty 7-10 minute 3-0 victories, the premade v premade games were the highlights of the day. 
---
There are a premade on who had a reputation as dodgers on our faction back then. We just didnt care.   
---
No one in our group was aiming for HWL per se, we just loved playing wow. Winning BGs was the reward. Screenshotting the score screen at the end was the reward. Having the SSs to shut people down on the forums when they talked themselves up was the reward. Sure some of us got R13 and all of us got R10. But it wasnt the aim--playing the game was; gear was the happy reward we got.
---
So is it better to group up and quest separately for the extra xp boost?
---
Play what you like man enjoy classic for now.
---
You are dealing with an almost 50 year old....I thought discord was a vent alternative.  And I still use vent.  Get off my lawn!  ;)
---
Riva can cap frames.
---
Use it.
---
I didn't read anything wrong, you're just trolling at this point.
---
&gt; Nostalrius had dynamic respawns and sharding for the starting zones.
---
* Nostalrius did not have dynamic respawns
---
* Nostalrius did not have sharding
---
Therefore, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I'm guessing you're confusing zone phasing with sharding which are completely different things.
---
I agree. People need to be more vocal against layering. It has literally 10,000 drawbacks that are all game breaking.. and I seriously can't think of a single positive. Blizz could easily just make more servers &amp; drop layering. It would cost them time &amp; $ though.. and between the $50 demo, the resubbing for beta, the early paid character names, etc. It's obvious it's all just a cash grab. If they cared about the game at all, they would have no layering.
---
I'd raise my hand but I'm a retail shill in it for the $$$$$
---
They said the layering during the BlizzCon QnA. I understand what you say tho, im just really worried that this horrible layering system can destroy the economy the pvp and the community overall, they need to find a better way than this.
---
Gnomeregan is in significantly worse shape than Thunder Bluff
---
I mean kinda. It rolls against everyone - its all personal loot but you can kill a boss and not get loot.
---
Yeah I hate it when games scale everything.  
---
It removes that little motivation: "if I get stronger then I can go to X and kill Y!"  Instead you can just go anywhere and do anything, and combined with the dumbing down of all the content so none of it is challenging it makes the whole leveling process of games feel meaningless or maybe even masturbatory.
---
Of course! Hits me in the feels!
---
Scrap it all, world of StarCraft.
---
He's asking for low CDs. Shamans have a ton of situational totems (cleansing for poisons against rogue, tremor for fear), not to mention you need to drop them individually.
---
Paladin is probably easier.
---
do you have a link to the blue post? not doubtin you, i'd just like to read it myself
---
I had a few aš well. 😂
---
It doesn't, it's just part of the circlejerk.
---
Does it cost a significant amount of mana though?
---
No AV yet. But did a 80 man raid group (two full raids) and it ran so smooth. That was without a gpu even
---
Honestly, even if this is a bug, id really like them to only layer "early" game content like they stated earlier in blizzcon back when it was sharding.
---
I get the need for it during release, but by the time players hit contested zones (which should be the cutoff line for "early" areas imo)  they should have enough options to spread out that it woulden't be too congested
---
I was WRONG about CLASSIC WOW. Here's why.
---
Even if you can’t get that exact feeling you want Or had, you can at least still remember where you were who you were with that gave you that intense feelings and you could at least share the moment with others and share that experience
---
Hi, /u/xzerosleep, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Are you aware that layering is a temporary solution to the overcrowding and as said by the devs that it shouldn't last past the first few weeks and or would definitely be done before phase 1 is complete?
---
Even if you were right about layering being awful it won't even be around for that long.
---
pepeJAM
---
We can only post this to @BlizzardCS + their forums and hope they're listening. It's pretty scary given how much they ignored during the BFA Beta. Here is to hoping they have a different approach for Classic.  
---
I was hoping they'd only implement layering based on a mixture of principles: level (1-10), zone and an actual IRL time frime (aka &lt;2 weeks). It's strange that it's just a flat out server architecture that persists at all levels but I'll trust Blizzard this time given how active Omar and his team have been.
---
Everyone who owns stock is a "part owner" of a business
---
40 man raid bosses dropped like 3-4 pieces of loot. Maybe 2? Epics in vanilla were truly "epic".
---
A lot of unique Pet characteristics got normalized in the Pre-AQ patch. The wolf you're referring to is Lupos, who used to easily the best pet for raiding due to dealing shadow damage (and furious howl is a solid raid buff).
---
That said, attack speed did not get normalized with that patch.
---
To answer your question: there won't be any pet's dealing shadow damage or have additional movespeed (outside of dash/dive),  but a beast's attack speed will still persist after you tame it.
---
OMG, Petopia, now, there's a flashback!!  I'd still tame the green and black armored boar from ...dammitall, from ....that place the quillpigs lived.  I loved im, even though he had no special anything.  I called him Wigglesnout.
---
If I drop tailoring, won't I have to restart  from a skill level of 0 when ZG becomes available?
---
You're the smallest person I've run into online in a long time.
---
I agree that hard modes ruined raiding.
---
I mean, what's the point of Mythic raids if they are going to be nuked with nerfs by the time casual guilds catch up??
---
Having ONE big raid is so much more fulfilling, you may not kill it in 1 month as top guilds do, but once you do kill it 2-3 months later you will feel satisfied as fuck. And it's way more fulfilling to kil the boss once than killing it on LFR, Normal, Heroic &amp; then Mythic.
---
I mean you weren't extreme either. It's absolutely insane to be married to someone who doesn't want you to do something that makes you happy. That just blows my mind that he's ready to live the rest of his life like that. We only get ONE.
---
What a pipe dream. For other people, not you. Gratz friend on the life achievements.
---
"Your fun is wrong."
---
Make more servers. Problem solved. Are you all paid accounts?? Seriously. I've never seen so many people want sharding / layering so bad. Everybody knows it ruins every game, yet you all want it.
---
&gt; "FUCKING STREAMERS"
---
I think he messing around lol
---
Guess I should have said, the loot itself (like the legendary affixes) is great, the loot system needs work.  What I wish was different was not the items themselves, but just making more of them were viable. I think if they had put in more endgame content (PvP, survival, etc.), it would have expanded the pool of viable builds. I do agree that set items and completely unbalanced legendaries (CoE, for instance) also contribute to this.
---
This could happen. Next up Classic BC.
---
Where does it say at launch? Very interesting that I would leave it out. Using phasing and sharding interchangeably was stupid, but the point still stands.
---
Or because Hinterlands was open world, and you could team with as many people you'd like.
---
Hellfire Peninsula
---
Not sure what sandwiches have to do with this.
---
Yeah, that was pretty gross.  It's a culture many of us hope to avoid on release due the aforementioned.
---
I'll be honest, this has shown me how critical it is to avoid streamer realms.
---
Exactly what I mean, getting the raid done was a reward itself, not it's a chore to get meaningless epics.
---
I personally think, that while there is some degree of gate keeping, vanilla community is more welcoming than current wow. If your tank is struggling, rather than replacing the tank, you'll teach and let them learn, since its most likely faster than replacing.
---
If you're first time tanking in current wow and you're not fast enough, know the most optimal route or otherwise struggle, you'll get kicked. If you dont provide achievement, play "fotm" class or otherwise stay within the meta, you wont get either invited or get kicked.
---
Just one example.
---
This was the case in vanilla WoW too and for a good reason.  Blizzard can't see what changes to textures/models you made, just that there is a difference between what Blizzard expects and what you have.  You could have manipulated the files to give yourself an in-game advantage, or you could have been some items look sharper.  Blizzard can't tell which it is.
---
&gt; Each raid tier comes with 2 raids, 1x20 man and 1x10 man.
---
Vanilla had 40 man raids.
---
I believe the quote was "only a few weeks and certainly by phase 2"
---
It also depends on their definition of "a few". Is 7 weeks "a few"?
---
Weeeeell, ok. I’ll take it.
---
Like he said, it mainly comes from BFA's beta where a large amount of bugs were addressed after launch and not during beta.  
---
Personally I think what happened is that because they were working for so long on Legion and giving that expansion content for the player-base (A reaction to WoD, which by the way suffered because of Legions development), that they had much less time to develop BFA and iron things out correctly.
---
The only one those that would be viable from a long term goal would be crit resistance. 
---
Thought that in itself would be the same as crit rating.
---
"Oh yeah I got 567% crit chance, but it is only really 20 crit chance vs the boss's 547% crit resistance".
---
But that fight was garbage and boring compared to the illidan encounter. I quit wow within a week of our first illidan 25 kill. I remember being so disappointed and let down.
---
Hahahah
---
1.  Watch stream.
---
2.  Log on to a realm, /who &lt;name&gt;
---
3.  Secret?
---
I’m 50. Played vanilla. Enjoying Classic. Not grumpy.
---
12 months at once probably not. Month to month and likely 12 months hell yes. Even just gearing and world pvp is soo fun at 30.
---
The game immersion is broken with layering. The economy is ruined for every server for the entire lifespan because of layering. The whole meta will be how to outlayer / outshard every one else. It's not even Classic WoW anymore. It's just a layering sim. All the cool world stuff, PVP that you will never see because of the multiple layers you will be on. GG. You all want it. Literally 99% of Reddit on here want layering and are begging for it.
---
Every class is going to have situational spells to maximize their effectiveness. Paladins have BoP, Freedom, HOJ, Sacrifice, Cleanse, etc.
---
Paladin is certainly one of the easier classes but I think that Shamans have the highest effectiveness at their skill floor.
---
I don’t understand how this experience was unique to an expansion and not Vanilla. You could do the same and put the BiS list together then too. And you will do it again in classic.
---
That could be an unexpected silver lining : if the layering bug persists and causes the mafia headaches!
---
for all the time i played league, i didn't think about the pentakill, believe it or not
---
Farm warglaives a second time, please kill me
---
Basically any post that isn’t a streamer doing something is tagged as low effort or deleted in here. One of the worst modded subs around.
---
I have beta.  Leveled to 27, had fun, reported the only bug I found, and deleted my toon.  I'm working overtime every week and spending time with family and friends before launch. 😁
---
Right, they are talking about hiding character names, playing old vods and claiming its a live stream, etc.
---
Also, a simple /who may not work if other people try to claim those names.
---
RFK
---
(I have never seen groups of people mounted up roaming around together for kills)
---
Phase 2 will likely be an eye opener for you.
---
I'm eating crow. Wildstar went under and I lost my fav MMO and my fav PvP. No multiplayer game has caught my interest in a hot minute, too. I haven't touched WoW since MoP as the daily rep grins to unlock daily rep grinds killed my enjoyment, along with Hunters getting focus instead of Mana. It didn't feel like *my* WoW. Still, even with the announcement I wasn't keen on the price point and I've already played this game. It'll be broken trash and I do think a lot of people don't know what they're in for with Classic.
---
After seeing the "Beta players are reporting classic features as bugs!" post, I started digging back into WoW stuff. I remember all the fun of World PvP and Classic BGs. All that broken shit and having to hunt down pets. I want to run all the way from Ashenvale to The Barrenson foot to get that black lion again. I want to hunt pets down, as that sort of collecting gameplay is what I'm all about. Convinced my boyfriend to give it a try *(He started in TBC and plays retail)* along with my dad, so now I'm hyped to PvP once more. Wish my old WoW friends were interested in Classic, but I'm excited to make new MMO friendships too.  
---
Still salty that Blizz will have Classic bundled with Retail, as I'm never going to touch retail. Really, *really* don't want to give them that full $15 bucks for an old ass, finished game because Blizz-Activision isn't a company I have any love for anymore but whatever. I want to play, I'll give it a shot and see if it fills my MMO need.
---
[removed]
---
Name? I joined up with NA in TBC til we disbanded on Eredar Twins. Citgo here. Definitely remember the Epic drama, heh.
---
40 man raids with todays mechanics would be a clusterfuck. I dont mean an exact copy of vanilla raiding but the core concept of single difficulty raiding and that the entire raid does not have to be cleared in the first or second lockout
---
Because my comment that you responded to as well as this entire conversation is about server launches. I wasn't expecting you to make a completely irrelevant comment, therefore I'm assuming you're talking about launch like everyone else.
---
Yup it's gonna be a secret until about 32 seconds after they start streaming from whatever server they're one. You can make money from streaming, or you can be anonymous. Can't be both.
---
So big streamers are going to not be streaming the launch of Classic?  Come on.  No one believes that.
---
Don't tell me what to do!
---
Dem Echo Isles tho
---
It supports multiple cores, not sure how many though.
---
Completely agreed about sharing something we care about and defending it against offensive spam!
---
I just didn't get that vibe from the OP's statement.
---
It wasnt unique to WotLK for everyone, but it was for me. I realized that this series of expansions wouldnt stop once we killed Arthas. I'd have to raid and be active...forever...for my character to be relevant for more than a few months.
---
That's why I quit. And that's why I'm excited for Classic.
---
personal loot is a thing, yes.
---
They will stream it, but they are talking about blocking out character names, maps, going full cam, aka having very limited information to see which server they are on.
---
did they extend the test ?
---
Yeah let them have it ,we seem to be the minority. I had my fair share of vanilla back in 05 and private servers anyway. I am not gonna be a part of a layering meta in classic, no way.
---
I made a comment from my experience on Nost, and how they ended up handling the large playerbase. My comment maybe irrelevent to you, but clearly you are just looking for an argument anyway.
---
I've decided to roll Horde because of Asmongold...
---
Another reason why Classic is going to be good.
---
Layering should not exist, period. It's like Blizz can't get out of their our way. They have a slam dunk, easy homerun success and they find a way to ruin it still. They can't even recreate their own game.
---
So it takes me 3 minutes longer to run my character to where they are on stream and see if they're around.
---
They should ask blizz for their own “layer”. Streamers only
---
All of the well-known areas are still going to be reachable.  Above undercity, under stormwind, under org, troll village, hyjal, etc.  The crazier areas are the ones I have my doubts about.  I remember being able to get below deadmines and use that to walljump to reach the BRM skybox which I don't think will be possible.
---
LMAO buy my gold from my bots when classic launches retard
---
I make more money selling  gold off my websites than you make at your shitty development job maintaining some garbage legacy base. This is the worst case of Employee mindset I've seen in a minute
---
The Wayback Machine is a great project in general.  It's cool to hear you guys are using it for this.
---
Same so I’m going female Tauren 😂😂
---
Paid troll account, ignore this guy. Nobody that cares about Classic wants layering.
---
Fear ward.
---
I guess killing every mob you find between quests
---
That could work, what are the chances of layering separating you from them?
---
Shadow priest is actually ok with pre-raid gear and rank 10. Even better if you can do MC for Anethema.
---
Play Tauren If you're horde lol.
---
&gt; Well actually given the formula you provided we can probably just assume a 5 weap skill difference therefore a 10 percent glance difference right?
---
Correct, the issue though is that not all glances are the same, it's not a flat reduction theres a range where it can fall.
---
So you'd need a way to calculate how often you're fighing enemies the same level, how often you're fighting them below your level, and how often above. You'd then need to calculate the average reduction you're getting from glancing blows at these different levels, and then average these different levels with each other. 
---
TL;DR is it's complicated to the point where it's easier to just say the Axe probably slightly outperforms the sword a majority of the time, but there axe niche situations where it won't.
---
Level as much as is reasonable, store every crafting reagent in the bank to be either vendored or auctioned later depending on the server economy, and get to know the people in whatever guild I end up joining.
---
It would be cool if there was a streamer server lol. Would actually be kind of fun to have all of the streamers in the same place.
---
Not really no.
---
But you use your mount for over a year, I certainly wouldn't want one that has actual downsides compared to a normal one.
---
Well luckily for you, if they’re successful then you won’t have any of the negative impacts of playing on a big streamer’s server that you seem to be so deathly afraid of.  OR they fail at hiding their server and you can play else where.  
---
This is only a problem because you’re making it one in your own head.
---
I'm worried there wont be many mobs. I can see myself fighting to do quests that require waiting on mob spawns.
---
 If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 degrees Celsius... you're gonna see some serious shit.
---
I've done this a ton in wc too on private servers. I can't be asked to run wc twice either.
---
It doesn't have to be me.  If that guy has 5k viewers or 50k, or whatever, they'll find his ass.  I'll be shocked if it takes more than five minutes.
---
Honestly it's a little sad to feel that's even necessary for a stress test
---
Prot warrior will stay best until TBC.
---
Paladins and Druids were great in TBC because of how good they were at AOE threat.
---
That's that Vanilla spirit!
---
I dont think Classic will be destroyed by layering in the first phase. Depending on your choice of server, layering might be a non issue. We just have to wait and see what they do with the system during upcoming stress tests. I honestly just want a smooth launch at this point.
---
You did a poor job presenting your argument. You come off as frustrated, adversarial, and snarky with the ad-hominems. This will not convince anybody and will, in fact, probably lead people toward opposing your proposition, whether it's logical or not.
---
It depends. I’d recommend doing whatever you have the most fun with. If you want to level as a group, sure go for it. Lone wolf? Why not be your own man. Classic isn’t a race to 60, don’t worry about how to level the fastest. It is the journey not the destination.
---
Then those people should learn how to play properly. If you're going to kick me for playing a meme spec I'm going to kick you for dpsing like a retard.
---
Doesn't seem like it, but it will still be up for the next 20 hours
---
The apply for classic beta is a new thing it came out like the 15th of May so what you updated isn’t for classic sadly
---
Stormstrike? Isn't that from bc pre-patch
---
&gt;implying that this isn't the plan
---
They will later reveal which server they are on, most likely once they get to 60. It's hard to say exactly how much of an issue it would be, I would just rather play on a server not dominated by these groups.
---
Well, I guess that is vanilla experience
---
There are times when I loved to loop music.  Other times when I turned music off entirely and cranked up the ambient sounds.
---
The audio in WoW has always been incredible and is worth exploring every setting.
---
The Undercity throwback to WC3 blew my mind and is still one of my favorite things to share with people that haven't experienced it yet.
---
They might not like the idea of going away from retail
---
Dude I totally planned on playing an orc but orc has got to be the most common so I'll probably roll undead to avoid a good chunk of people. Tauren probably has best start
---
Still remember training the guild tanks in Heroic shattered halls by using no CC at all, some of my best memories from wow.
---
Also SSC being my favourite raid ever, not sure why just loved it
---
A casual raiding guild might take you. 
---
A serious raising guild could take you on alt run nights (i.e. to MC/ZG after BWL is already on farm).
---
You'll need consumables for both physical and magical damage.  
---
You'll have a difficult time pulling close to competitive DPS as ret. Compared to similarly geared players of other classes, you'll fall behind. 
---
If you make it to BWL/AQ gear as ret, you'll be decent in pvp, but only because you'll ourgear the average player by a wide enough margin that any DPS spec could take them out. 
---
BC is when Ret really hit its stride. You're welcome to give it a shot, but you'll have to work twice as hard to do half the damage of a similarly geared rogue or warrior. 
---
Your best bet is to try to become a guild's Nightfall guy (axe with a debuff that increases the damage a mob takes). The job normally goes to hunters, but sometimes a Ret gets it.
---
True, I'm sure there will be a post on here about it.
---
"Probably gonna get downvoted" is even more cringe imo. Imagine caring about internet points this much. Just have an opinion.
---
Yeah true, especially if you want to PvP a lot. It's such a shame because it's one of the coolest looking mounts in the game imo.
---
So many possibilities! Even at level 10, Classic is so much more complex than BfA /s.
---
We have to force them
---
Too!
---
All I can say for certain is that it’s in the beta. Most likely it’ll be on classic. It’s an accessibility option just like colorblind mode, so chances are it will stay.
---
1. What’s the rush
---
2. Looks like you might have to talk to people and take turns, group up, form a line. Just how vanilla was :)
---
Yeppp. I agree with this.
---
My gf thinks I'm a nerd for playing wow, but she doesn't care that I play or talk about it to her. She's excited for me because I'm excited. It sucks some people just can't respect their SO's hobbies. Some just get stuck in a relationship with someone more controlling.
---
What if Omar wrote that. What if...
---
The reporting or the people spamming?
---
Agree so much. Loved heading back to Elwynn after questing in Westfall and now level 15 or so and feeling like a god and that I'm progressing as a character. And as you say, the mystery of heading in to a zone that had higher level mobs than you was always so much fun.
---
Raids can range from 30min to 5 hrs depending on how good your guild is.
---
That would slightly ruin it for streamers in general. If every streamer is streaming the exact same raid, for example, what’s the point in watching any but the most popular one?
---
Oh okay, I was under the impression it was single core, I've seen a coulle threads about people opting for intel for this reason.
---
There is zero chance they make it to 60 without everyone knowing their server.  
---
/who &lt;level&gt;
---
Oh hai!
---
this is a very great add-on, looks so clean and better than other ones. do you have a version for wow vanilla and not classic? i tried using it on a vanilla private server and sadly it did not work :(
---
Yup. People that literally just want some attention for 2 seconds, except it'd be magnified once they get that initial attention and want more and more
---
Fuck tips out , lying to his viewers.
---
Its literally the same here on Horde with Sodapop and Venruki
---
&gt; 1.1\] Or is it economically better to just pay for respec whenever you want to do the other content type? 
---
Fuck. Don't put *that* idea in my head. We have ten slots and there are eight classes.
---
....If I'm honest with myself, I can see myself making a second Hunter specifically to lvl via BGs. I planned just to have my main Hunter be all for wPvP/BGs/Farming as I don't expect to have the free time for raiding, buut-  
---
Tempting.
---
RAZORFEN!!  Thank you.
---
You're totally right, there is no rush. I'm so excited to spend literally all my time inside classic wow regardless of what I'm doing. But I could totally see myself getting annoyed after awhile of waiting, when I could've just been running somewhere enjoying the scenery and meeting people doing the same thing
---
I like that different raids are different difficulties. The solution was already there as it was in Vanilla/BC. You had a couple of easy starter raids and then a couple of really tough gating bosses. This also allowed for the next raid's first few bosses to be relatively easy as a reward. I miss this so much eventhough I wiped so much on certain BC bosses, it really felt great to finally beat them. I doubt I would have felt so great when we finally killed Muru if I already killed it on two other difficulties.
---
Now it's this silly play the patch system that trivializes all the prior content. It's such a waste and it really limits the scope of the game.
---
Tbf that's a good way to test layering in all seriousness. It's something Blizzard has to consider for live
---
Darkshore has so many quests, but if you move around to Redridge, loch modan, and Westfall you don't have to go there. Especially if you kill mobs on the way to and from quest hubs.
---
Ok but EQ2 has at the very least pretty much all worthwhile specs and gear for all of the specialization and it released at the same time.
---
Won't get that good of results unless you run census
---
I assumed this was how it would happen. Won't all these big streamers want to be on the same server to increase competition amongst another?
---
Vanilla brain activated. Need to brainstorm ideas of leveling during crazy vanilla release
---
Yeah its bad...really bad.  Like I don't know how anyone could watch that &amp; think that is acceptable in an MMORPG.  One of the cornerstones of what made vanilla successful was the one world/one community experience it provided.  A single server shouldn't be divided up into multiple dimensions.
---
Sounds like you got carried. A solid tank can trivialize a lot of the mechanics. Or your group over-leveled the dungeon.
---
Try doing strat dead side 45 minute run with an under-geared party, or try doing scholomance in all greens without CC and get back to me.
---
Probably not going to enjoy it much, just going to be honest some dungeons take HOURS just to get your group together and get there.
---
You can, if you run RES ("Reddit Enhancement Suite").
---
Lol dude, this has been so entertaining to me. Your comment history is just you going around being an absolute fucking retard and asshole to absolutely everyone and it's mind boggling. How that is gratifying I will never know, and I don't believe for a second you're above the age of 16 acting that way. It looks like I might be one of the first people that actually got to you in terms of how fucking stupid you are. You ACTUALLY followed my other comments around and replied to them. In all my years on Reddit I've NEVER had anyone do that no matter the circumstances. Even the mods came and removed your mongoloid comments, and now you come back all "serious" with some kind of lecture like I give a fuck lol. It is truly sad and pathetic, and you coming back at me basically just repeating my comments to you proves that your dumb ass has no capability of intelligently insulting anyone. All your stuff is just "hyuk hyuk retard cApItAl LetTers". There's no way you aren't a child. You seriously need to get the fuck off twitch, get a life and get some better tools for discourse and dissing people. You really suck at it, lol l. I'm having fun showing my friends this back and forth because of how actually dumb you are. Now I won't be coming back to reply to whatever you say here because I've proven my point and gotten waaaaay under your skin. Good luck out there little buddy! It's been a hoot.
---
Wow mon, sounds like someone didn't stay away from de voo doo
---
Great post ^^^
---
You don't need to be a streamer to have fun lol.
---
I think the Red Ribbon Arc was the best one lol.  That arc took you all over the world and I liked the RR officers.  and Mercenary Tao was awesome
---
Did you even play classic wow? Servers were down all the time and the game was unplayable regularly.
---
Thank you for understanding and answering my question perfectly! This is exactly what I was trying to figure out. Appreciate the extra info too regarding movement speed and resists. I actually had thought snarlers resistances were removed later on, past 1.12.
---
Scaling has made leveling a bit weird.  Toss in heirlooms and the lower XP to level, and I've taken a Highmountain Tauren through a small part of Ashenvale (one of the quests kept bugging, so I gave up), all of the main story of Stonetalon Mountains, all of Nothern Barrens, and am already over level 50 (haven't done many dungeons while leveling).  I'll pretty much just need one more zone, and I'm 60.
---
Granted, in the current experience, I'm not too sad about that, because I'm being told to level 90-100 levels through content I've done literally dozens of times in order to unlock special sets of armor, which feels like a bit of a tedious chore just to get something I'm not sure I'll ever use.  The scaling ends up making it more convenient to level, at the expense of not really feeling like you're getting more powerful than a zone's range.
---
That's my big issue with scaling.  Yeah, I have more choice of where to level, and can quest through a lower level zone longer while it's still "relevant"... but when I'm level 50 and can't just blow through mobs in the Barrens, that's just weird.  Even more so when I eventually hit 60.  At that point I should be wrecking anything outside of a select few zones.  Having to work at killing striders in the zone that's just outside the starting area when you've put on that many levels just makes it feel like the levels meant nothing.
---
Oh, I won't be playing...I don't need that meth in my life right now.  I just was curious.  Lupos is who I was thinking of, my husband named it Ghost (he had just read ASOIAF).  I have so much nostalgia for those days.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
I think it would be the best way to do it. I imagine it would be the goal but its possible they will spread out
---
Have an alternate account with a mage, run dungeons with your lowbie + others
---
This entire sub turned into a circle jerk.
---
In my very humble opinion, I think no form of expanding on the original game is going to work. 
---
The take away from this is that expansion models in MMORPGs rarely work and certainly not after the first one or maybe two.
---
What Blizzard needs to do here is essentially make WOW 2. Redesign a whole new game from the ground up
---
There are pros to level scaled and downsides.  I think its nice to change it up.  Retail has been level scaled for awhile, so going to a non-level scaling world will be fun for awhile.
---
That card looks like the one I had to buy after my standard radeon card melted in the karazhan dance hall
---
So, let's say a big streamer rolls on a server and tons of rabid fans join.
---
Been thinking about this for a bit, and don't really see it presenting as big a problem as people keep talking about.
---
Are they going to all keep leveling up as fast as the streamer?  I don't think that's very likely.
---
Isn't there the possibility of 'haters' rolling on the same server (if it's PvP) just to kill the streamer and followers of the streamer?  I think it's very likely.
---
They will want you to find out as soon as possible. It what keeps there audience active as well as keeping them earning money. All week I've seen them interact with the audience inviting them doing big raids. If no one knew then they couldn't do any of that. I think it will be they get to level 10 and then tell everyone that way they have a buffer
---
They are dumb, and short sighted. When everyone hits cap and wants to progress, only the chosen 40 will do everything.... All those people who thought they were in will realise they aren't and leave. The end
---
Undead will probably be just as bad as the orc starting zone. So many undead priests/mages/locks. Troll will probably be the least played. Tauren is your best bet for completely avoiding the mass herds of people leveling. I will be leveling undead or troll priest. Still undecided. Kind of thinking about waiting a week or so after launch.
---
Classic BFA server when
---
I will never understand people posting or wanting to see people's computers and old video game boxes.
---
I mean, they're pretty similar and I don't think that's ever been a hidden fact. I don't see it ruining classic though, else people wouldn't be okay with dynamic respawns and that type of thing on private servers

The person I'm replying to did.
---
Also to one of your points, there was a way to allow people to catch up - remove the attunements for the next raid way later in the cycle.
---
This worked really well with Hyjal and BT as the first group of bosses were way easier than KT. 
---
Also, I really miss running these farm raids on alts. Really helped build guild cohesion to enjoy a new class while helping someone get their one specific item or whatever they still needed on their main.

---
Jesus, did Blizzard make a single positive change after vanilla??
---
I swear every time I learn something new it's always an unbelievably stupid change.
---
I sure will when everyone is camping quest areas, flight paths, road choke points rather than running around aimlessly.
---
&gt; let people who just want end game content buy level boosts.
---
Yeah, no, that doesn't work, because you can't boost allied races.  They force you to level those from 20, even though lore-wise it makes no sense and leads to a more confusing story than usual.  So if you have to manually level them, the leveling has to be modified to not be such a massive chore that people never feel like completing it, especially as they're doing that grind for an alt.
---
A long grind is fine the first maybe half dozen times you do it, but by the time you've done it a few times, and done all the stuff like getting a reputation to Exalted through more grinding, the last thing you want to deal with is yet another long grind to make what you just unlocked worth having.
---
Of course, all that could be fixed by having Legion allied races start at 100, and BFA allied races start at 110, which still feels a little weird in the story context, but not nearly as much as, say, Mag'har Orcs going through the bizarre time warp of the world and then witnessing the opening of the portal to the world they came from and being treated like some kind of bizarre otherworldly specimen.
---
During legion, numbers became worthless to me.  I couldn't tell if 2M was allot or little. Also the massive power creep keep intensifying that problem "a pimped out 110 had 5 times more hp than a fresh 110". Then their was how the amount of AP needed to rank up grew exponentially.
---
Well they've changed it a bit so that the effect isn't as visible, but yeah it's basically just a way of rebranding sharding so that Blizz can justify using sharding.
---
I know Ion said it'll be removed after phase 1, but I really don't think it's going to happen. They are relying on a huge assumption: That the population completely plummets after the first few weeks. If they overestimate, then we'll be stuck with layering.
---
I will be playing rather casually. (15-20 hours a week probs)... Although ill start out with friends I know inevitably I will play a lot without my IRL friends. I played a warrior from Vanilla-Mists before quitting. 
---
Now returning I'm not sure what to play... I want to PvP a bit due to the limited time but I am aware that I will have to complete a lot of PvE to get decent gear... I'm worried that maining a warrior first again will lead to poverty as it did for me in vanilla (Albeit I was very shit in vanilla so that could be why)...  
---
I was thinking something between hunter or lock for the first toon, which will allow me to level reasonably easily and also farm later on down the track. But im still not sure which one would be better for the PvP/ casual PvE as I described above.  
---
Or am I kidding myself and I should just main a warrior from the beginning and accept the harder questing/farming/gearing.  
---
Hunters deadzone makes me not want to hunter;  
---
Warriors expenses (plate) and ability to be constantly kited deters me from them;  
---
Scared I will be squishy with the lock as they pull ahead a lot later in the game/ never mained a caster so not sure what to expect  
---
  
---
Would love to hear peoples 0.02.
---
Thanks!
---
Maybe on retail vanilla when shit was insanely overpriced.
---
Glad we got this dedicated team on Classic.
---
dynamic respawn was in classic wow, confirmed a few days ago by devs.
---
I was honestly going to play a shadow priest because of mana burn. Can’t justify playing one of the most boring leveling classes though when I’ve already done it and don’t want to heal at 60.
---
another hunter

&gt; That's what killed it. Not bad quest design, not bad zone design. They  made the content and the zones irrelevant outside of levelling, and then  in WoD, the final nail, they brought in the boost. 
---
You just reminded me... I have a level 100 boost still available in my account haha. I don't feel like ever using it...
---
Sharding will be in the game, changing the name won't matter. Just wait for it to be around for even longer or other bullshit things.
---
I like the overbearing FU of a Druid HOTs mixed a hunter pets poisons and stuns. As well as vine grip and other DOTS Druid’s really can add a lot of offensive utility.
---
 
---
Pally can take hits. Priest have the big heals. But Druid is like best of all that plus lots of cc.
---
I'm willing to bet not many people enjoy being around you in person.
---
No it isn't BiS until 30+. Strike of the Hydra at level 26 is definitely better.
---
Verigan's Fist is bad because it has no strength. So much of its itemization is wasted on int and spirit. Stamina isn't really needed while leveling a paladin either because the class already has such good survivability. 
---
Obviously the worst thing about Verigan's Fist is that you have to go to SFK, which is impossible to find a group for. Have fun spending 2 hours trying to find other paladins for this quest. Then good luck getting there. The run to SFK is a huge pain in the ass.
---
The amount of potential exp from the time that you waste on this quest is what makes Verigan's Fist truly an awful weapon.
---
While you Alliance are reading books, your women are sneaking to Orgrimmar for a good time.
---
To be honest when I tried retail briefly two years ago after not having played for 10 years the fact that this carrot was no longer a thing made me unreasonably sad.
---
I think a lot of people won't be able to keep up, that is if they're trying to just be aidsy or trying to get attention, or trying to gank them imo
---
Knowing your class in and out can make you dangerous against almost anyone.
---
If you want to be the best 1v1 dueler, of course this doesn't apply to you.
---
World PvP and BGs though?  Know your situations and know your abilities and you can wreck people, regardless of what you are.
---
There are always classes that shine against other classes, but that's part of knowing what you play.  Don't engage a decked out version of rock in your less geared version of scissors unless the situation gives you the advantage.
---
If you look at the background on the trinket slot on the character sheet, they look like earrings.
---
Project Titan, blizzards planned upcoming MMO was scrapped and became Overwatch.  
---
I really doubt they are working on another MMO right now. Probably sticking to wow expansions for a bit.
---
Shut up, you'll jinx the Bannerlord release!
---
Until you get one good squigherder on the other team sniping your ass
---
Reserve name on 13th..log in to start rested log right off.  Work on level 5 bank alt.  Start main 2 days later
---
The blank tabard hit me harder in the feels than I thought it would.
---
All valid points.  Its not perfect for sure.  I always thought gw2 did it better tbh.  I thoroughly enjoyed world completion in gw2 where as lore master was tedious in wow.
---
QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ
---
&gt; In BfA you actually get weaker, relatively, when you reach 120.
---
It was like that in Legion.  Hitting 110 meant suddenly the mobs were a lot nastier in relation to you, so you wanted to get out of the world at large and start queuing up for dungeons so you could get enough gear to get back to the power level you'd been, much less feel like hitting that mark meant you were more powerful.  For a while, IIRC, there was even some scaling relative to gear level, which is just an insanely stupid idea.  Why put in the effort to get that better gear if it doesn't make you actually feel more powerful?
---
Isn't that how it is right now? If Soda or Asmon are streaming, everyone is watching them. When they go offline, everyone in the thousands range gets a big uplift.
---
OCE servers aren't officially confirmed yet though right?
---
Depends on your definition of challenging. I’d say punishing is probably more accurate.
---
Thanks for the reply. Sounds like a fine tuned machine. Also sounds like you have more than enough people ready to go to ensure the progression. So when you say after 3 months people will drop out... that probably means you will be going for more world firsts and hardcore progression...
---
Something ive always wanted to do, maybe one day I will. Wish you the best, have fun!
---
They don't need to make it to 60, they just need to make it to level 10 basically.
---
Does this change theorycrafting for melee dps and tank threat?
---
Exactly, dude.
---
That's why you stream for 8 hours like a workday and then play on an anonymous alt for 8 hours outside work hours.  
---
Developers for all MMOs do this and it's very rare that they are found out, evne when they are prominent.
---
I think OP is referring to the now elitist know-it-all toxicity currently circulating. Ofc during vanilla we were all on equal footing so there was a minimal amount. Now however some people may not be so kind to fresh players and scare them off.
---
&gt;It's best in slot weapon till like 30+.
---
No it isn't. Lvl 24 [Gizmotron Megachopper](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9490) is just as good. Lvl 26 [Strike of the Hydra](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6909) is definitely better.
---
Now once you factor in all the time you've wasted finding a group for SFK and running there without a mount, Verigan's Fist is a piece of trash.
---
what does this mean for hunters?
---
To be fair everybody was able to login fast today
---
Well I mean even if the mob had not disappeared and had died, because he was invited after the mob was tagged would he still recieve zero XP from the kill and no chance at anything that dropped?
---
This is incorrect, it seems to exclusively use a single-core. It's not even DX12-compatible, which the multi-core support requires.
---
There's no way the high viewer streamers would avoid streaming til they're 60, and even then it's unlikely that they wouldn't be noticed unless they're using a unique name AND common people they're playing with use unique names.
---
You can who: levels, zones, classes, races
---
There is no way they make it out of their starter zones without being discovered.

And if you're worried about raid slots, just look at how many people (just in this sub) say 'I know this is optimal, but this sounds fun to me and I want to play it instead.'

Stop checking wowhead for that. It lists the patch the item was added **to Wowhead's database**. Every single vanilla item was added to wowhead's database in 1.11 or 1.12. Every single item on classic.wowhead is added on 1.13 as that's the patch the Classic client is on.
---
Pog! lvl 10.
---
[https://imgur.com/laHDLxG](https://imgur.com/laHDLxG)
---
Oh very true. You're exactly right.
---
Slow leveling only works if there are other forms of meaningful character progression.  In classic it works because item drops are very meaningful and take effort to get.  
---
In retail there's are no challenges, and you level largely with "heirlooms" that level with you, making drops pointless.
---
Blizzard playing the long con so they can recycle old zones into new 120-1xx zones come the next expansion because "due to zone scaling we don't need all these zones for 1-60". Especially since 2-4 zones from level 20 gets you to 60 in current year
---
No it won't. They are planning on having each layer occupy the size of a typical vanilla realm, ie about 3000 players. Layering solves absolutely nothing, it's just a way for Blizz to save some money on servers.
---
It'd be neat if a lot of us old Earthen Ringers end up on the same server.  Sadly I finally gave up on the Field Marshal to Grand Marshal climb because my play time couldn't top Longarms.  I raided as Flornhand in OoS and still have tons of fond memories of both alliance and horde players.
---
If its your group then go ahead. Just understand you'll get that reputation.
---
That leads me to the final point, if you want to play weird shit then make your own group/guild and  nobody can tell you what to do. 
---
But again, nobody owes you anything and they might leave
---
Woah, this is heavy.
---
i will play shadow priest my brother hunter. traps pet and dots mind control is a good combination for pve and pvp
---
They want to accommodate streamers, who are going to have thousands of people want to play on the same server as them. That's fine, I get it. That's awesome. Of course, with 5-10x the number a server was originally designed to accommodate mobs don't spawn fast enough to reasonably level, and nodes aren't frequent enough to support the population; how can every raiding guild have enough flasks? How can there be enough devilsaur leather?
---
So ok. Just create multiple instances - basically two or three server layered on top of one another. But that's the wrong take. Dynamic spawns are the better solution and while nost and others didn't nail it, a beta with dynamic spawn testing would fare better than layering.
---
"Am I the only one...."
---
You're very right. &lt;Insert Streamer&gt; has been intentionally abusing/exploting the layering system during this stress test in ways that completely undermine the whole fucking point of vanilla wow. Layering needs to be gone pronto. Not a new name for it, not more restrictions, just gone.
---
Honestly though if you wait a week after launch, sure you'll probably have a less congested start zone but then you'll hit a constant congestion of every other zone
---
This idea sounds amazing.
---
ITS OVER 9000!
---
Yeah man, Blizzard pretty much continuously dropped the ball for hunters since vanilla. The class used to require so much finesse to play well and they really had a totally different feel. I remember my dwarf hunter back in the day felt so good when I tamed some rare spawn bear named frost claw (or something, it was so long ago), I died 3-4 times learning the best way to maximize the gaming time before he just killed me. Once I got him I felt so accomplished, but I had to quickly farm meat for him so he wouldn’t hate me. Farming meat used up all my bullets, so I just ran around meleeing things beside my bear to get some money back and buy ammo. 
---
It seems tedious, but there’s a reason I remember that so well and I don’t remember a single detail about cataclysm and on.
---
That's an issue with the itemization in the game.  It's insane how much difference even 15 ilvls can make, but at this point, you're hitting 120 likely under 300 ilvl, and even just running dungeons to get decked out in Heroic gear massive increases your power level.  It gets worse when you get closer to 400, you're so much more powerful that it feels weird you're still the same level.  But that also introduces the problem of people hitting 120 without any decent gear options outside of praying for RNG in dungeons and world quest rewards, due to professions being so useless.  The gear rewards are so meh that I'll often end up with heirlooms in slots for newer 120s for a while, waiting for a replacement, because it's better than what I was getting from the quests even in the higher levels.
---
The worst example I saw of it was getting my Mage to 120 to finally do Alliance stuff at max level.  I hit the cap during a Timewalking event, so was able to go buy a bunch of TW gear, which shot up HP and spell damage a ridiculous amount instantly.  Where it gets sad is that, owing to RNG, I still had an heirloom trinket equipped for weeks because I'd only found one trinket despite doing everything I could to get one.
---
Here's the thing, the whirlwind weapons actually have decent stats and the questline doesn't make you find a group for SFK and run to the most out-of-the-way zone without a mount.
---
Also leveling in the 20s is extremely quick, so you won't even be using it for a long enough time to merit the amount of effort to get it.
---
It depends who you talk to.  I'd like them to put in Azshara Crater as a BG.  It would be neat if they put in stuff in that you couldn't reach, even if it was neutral things that had no impact.  Like being able to go fishing in the troll village in Ashenvale.  Or the logging camp in Stone Talon.  Or the airport.  Or...
---
Just more of the world, even if it doesn't do anything.  New things of little consequence for the explorers and wanderers.
---
Attempt to group for kill quests / grind solo, leave starting zone around lv4 and start grinding the mobs outside could work
---
I think you'd be surprised.
---
TBC was great, and I never got the chance to raid in it properly so I'd be all for classic TBC servers.
---
Very cool, thanks. I'm not in the beta - not a current subscriber so didn't have a chance so wasn't sure.
---
I’m a noob when it comes to these things so forgive my ignorance but isn’t classic running on the legion client? Wouldn’t it work the same as WotLK?
---
Unfortunately no, sorry man. I don't have much experience with customizing Windows 10, but I'm sure it's possible
---
What does that have to do with what either of us are saying?
---
If they can't get Peter Dinklage, there's always Warwick Davis.
---
Nice rod you've got there :-)
---
Here's the thing. Priest leveling is pretty easy. You dot, you wand. Maybe you mind flay a bit. You have great sustain. The problem is that it's boring as fuck. I spent most of my time healing dungeons to level. I just can't stand wanding shit down. Priest has to be the least engaging class to level.
---
If you wanting an alliance hunter, you stand a better chance vs horde rogues and spriest as a Dwarf. Imagine stoneform as a poor man's Master's Call vs Rogues.
---
But 6 year old don't have credit cards, what is their target demographic??

If you play a melee character with your hunter friend, you will be sad.
---
I was full on the hype train, but my buddy was not even at the station waiting, he watched a few hours of streams, and was asking me what class/faction I was gonna pick.
---
It's a huge waste of time. It's practically impossible to find anyone else willing to do SFK unless it's another paladin on the same quest. So you have to spend at least an hour or two trying to form a group.
---
Didnt burn out till WOTLK bored fuck outta me before soooo probably not ;)
---
Doesn't even have to be guilds, just a group of maybe 5 or so people who all agree to help eachother abuse the layering system.

I get a 13.8% normalized dmg increase comparing axes to swords at 390 AP, the AP of a lvl 60 warrior. So at 30-40, that number will only be bigger. It seems like even at the max 10% penalty axe is still always better.
---
What I wouldn't give to play a Tauren rogue.
---
No scaling and no random loot.
---
I love the feeling of when it’s been just sounds of the world for a while then the music comes on. To me that’s when it most shines
---
While I'm entirely appreciative of people using their creativity to bring up admittedly nice suggestions for content to prolong the life of Classic .. - By god, please don't let it be time-travelling. I know it's based in the lore, but god damn.
---
Nice. Thank you!
---
Except now they have crap where you finally make it to nagrand in wod and you get a big pop up telling you to go do the legion content because nagrand mobs didn't scale below like 98 or something.
---
No worries. Thanks for the images regardless!
---
It's much worse than their original plan where they were only going to shard starting zones. Can't believe people are defending Blizzard...
---
anyone else just get booted?
---
I was told always Nelf over dwarf as a hunter for shadowmeld

Just wanted to share my journey with You from stress test 2#!
---
Have fun everyone!

---
its just telling you that you can do legion at 98, just close it and keep doing nagrand if you want.
---
So why are you here?
---
Lots of people.
---
I would assume this is an unpopular opinion, but I agree with OP 100%
---
I honestly would not be surprised if they took an osrs approach on this one.  After the two years or so that it will take to roll out and finish everything up to Naxx i could see them releasing new content that sticks to the philosophy of the game.  If they do it anything like osrs has, it'll be successful.  The new content there has been amazing but still feels very oldschool.
---
It feels great to support someone who provides content I enjoy! 
---
Feels solid man
---
I think the best overall level 10 talent is Nature's Grasp. Call me old fashioned 😵
---
it's not going to be hard to find out their server it's going to take like 10 seconds
---
Another circlejerk post.  
---
This is not even worth arguing over.
---
Fair, though personally I think the cycling back would be different from doing N/H/M one after another and burning out.
---
I wouldn't want the retail style rollout in classic, and I get why you'd hard pass on heroics at all based on past implementation.
---
How come Private Servers can do it just fine without Sharding and bigger pops than Blizz will have per server? We're talking a billion dollar company vs some guy in his basement, and the dude in his basement has a better product.
---
Twice, world server down
---
But the loot over there will be so much better.
---
[World server down](https://i.imgur.com/zfwDRYk.jpg)
---
You think the Barrens is the best zone in the game?
---
What the..
---
I take the sword cause it looks cooler, and more human-esque
---
Great video. Even though I play warlock I still love watching the streams. Keep it up man.
---
It made me sad to find out you no longer needed to hold onto 80 different keys to get into some dungeons/raids. It was like all the insanely hard work we had to do to get into those places 14 years ago didn’t matter and Blizz was like “nah that’s too hard.”, and it made it all cookie cutter to appease the people who just wanted it handed to them. 
---
Apparently I’m a bit more miffed about than I thought.
---
Most people taking issue with layering are ignorant. 
---
I have played pservers, you need layering or dynamic respawns or else the game IS UNPLAYABLE.
---
In the latest wrath server release that had like 200% or 300% faster respawns and shared quest item drops it was just people waiting around to hope to get a tag.
---
A starting zone cannot support 500+ people all level 1-2 mob/questing wise with retail spawn rate.
---
Layering, or something, is 100% REQUIRED to play the game the first few days to week (not sure what server pop will be).
---
After all this time, WoW was the WoW Killer
---
Hey man, even though I will not be rolling a priest, I appreciate your videos and twitch.  Good content and info in a clear concise manner.

Transmog was good for wow when it was added, there was a metric fuck ton of content that was just completely dead and served no purpose at all, but transmog gave it a reason to exist.
---
But for classic, it would be absolutely awful.
---
Funny because MoP stands out to me as the best expansion when it comes to storytelling. I'd guess most of it is not Blizzard's creation, but an adaptation of Chinese folklore... It would explain the higher quality.  
---
It is a step away from the usual "I am the master of \*whatever\*, you cannot stand against me, give up mortals. These are my plans (...). Don't even try to get in my way."

Awesome, thanks for the response, ill check it out!!

They might see you flip when you don’t on your screen :^)
---
Because I'm replying to someone that is saying that if blizzard just released classic in the same state it was, it would be perfect, which is just not accurate. They have to create a system to alleviate the same problems they had 10+ years ago.
---
More sad that there was never a throwing weapon class at all.
---
Also rolling literally every horde ability in WC3 into the shaman class (almost every one at least) was kind of lame.
---
This was always a strong combo past 30, which is when you can keep a _stealthed_ cat as a pet. But with the increased resolution on monitors these days, it's a bit too easy to tell the difference even from a distance.
---
I bet it'll still trick a ton of folks though.

---
Okay
---
&gt; Its a chore because the quests are so boring
---
Well... no.  They're not.  I leveled through the Cata zones when they were first redone and was so interested in the story and completing the quests that I'd end up slightly outleveling a zone before leaving it, because I wanted to wrap up the story, then follow the trail into the next zone.
---
Leveling is a chore because most of us have multiple alts, and if we want to get a new character to 120, we have to take them from 1 (or 20) all the way to 120.  It's not just getting to 60.  It's getting to 60, then going to Outland, then Northrend, then Cata content, then Pandaria, then Draenor, then the Broken Isles, then the BFA islands.  They merged Outland and Northrend, and Cata and MoP IIRC, so people would have fewer expansions to go through.  Heck, people avoid Outland the most while leveling, but it's the most like "vanilla" WoW in terms of questing, proving it's not the way the quests are done that makes leveling a chore.  It's that it's something we've done a number of times, and typically only do these days because we're told we have to manually level allied races if we want to get their special armor transmog.
---
It's like pretty much any other task.  For another example, take painting miniatures.  It's fun at first, you have a good time putting an army together, putting on all the different colors, doing the various highlights and shading and all that stuff.  But if you play a long time and get to, say, your sixth army to paint, it's not so much a joy anymore, it's more a job you have to complete before you can use your models.  (Granted, you don't *have* to paint them, as a lot of people prove, but for some of us, playing with grey plastic is kind of dull.)  So people find ways to help speed it up (like leveling in WoW).  A store manager introduced me to the trick of using a couple of specific washes to instantly "finish" a model with just a base coat.  Games Workshop is about to release a new set of paints that are specifically designed so you paint one coat on a model and it dries in a way to automatically provide shading and some highlighting.  Personally, I'm going to use the hell out of those paints to get through some of my backlog, just like I use heirlooms and other tricks to get through leveling in WoW.
---
Druid can beat any class 1v1.  I’d say their worst matchup is Paladin in that you can’t kill them, but they can’t kill you either.  But if you’re going alliance, it’s a non issue.
---
The only thing is, you’ll need to spec hybrid and play as the hybrid class that it is.  But that’s honestly the fun of the class... a typical fight would look like you starting in cat form / stealth, opening with pounce + rake + rip, shift to caster form and cast moonfire + insect swarm (optional hot if needed), swift to bear form for stun / Maul / Feral charge (if needed).  If your health is dropping faster than enemies, get hots up and life on travel form.  If enemy health is dropping faster than yours, just stay near and reapply dots as needed.
---
Of course a lot of this will depend on the matchup, but that’s the very general concept and shows that you’ll really utilize all forms while playing a Druid if you want to be successful.
---
You CAN play a moonkin Druid, and they’re actually not bad in PvP, they’re just not as good a going hybrid and utilizing all of your abilities.
---
Druids mainly get their bad rap from their PvE raid performance where they’re not really great at anything (can’t main tank, aren’t top healers, not good DPS).  They’re actually quite strong in PvP and I’d argue have the fewest true counters of all classes in the game when played correctly.
---
In this sub it's likely popular.
---
That said I also started in wrath and did like heirlooms for a time. Then I stopped rushing to max level and actually enjoyed leveling. I'd level my professions while leveling up, just taking my time. Definitely more enjoyable than trying to skip everything.
---
You can have as many accounts as you like, but are only allowed to share accounts within a household.
---
Says a person who never started on a fresh server before. 
---
You cannot play in starting zones with 500 others with retail spawn rates.
---
Make more servers. Obviously the populations will die down on some servers, and mergers will probably take place. That's better than layering though. Being stabbed in the eye with needles is better than layering.
---
Don’t think so, should be good but you’d need 2 subs
---
You think all of the people watching these streams are going to keep watching once they have a chance to play themselves?  
---
If all of the streamers are all raiding together, do you think the general public is gonna sit around and watch people level up fishing (or duel in front of Org/SW, or run bgs) when they could just go do it themselves?  
---
It will get to the point where only one person needs to stream, because 40 streams of the exact same thing is going to kill 39 of the streams
---
It started working after 90 minutes
---
Yeah, the risk of scaling fuckups is very real. I honestly wouldn't mind heroics as a pure or mostly showing off thing.
---
If they don't do anything like this fresh servers can have a similar revival of old content, so that works for me.
---
This is a minor issue anyway the game is better with it than without it.
---
imagine being the guy who doesn't know weaboo is a derogatory word for people who fetishize japanese culture and lumps it in with people who enjoy chinese things because Asians Is The Same
---
Learn engineering. There are a few tools you can pick up to help you escape the deadzone when playing as hunter. Also there are different pets for pvp and pve which can give you an advantage. Relatively high skill cap for being a good hunter and your dps doesn't scale as well into later raid tiers but a really cool class especially if you enjoy solo play!
---
"WE'RE UNDER ATTACK! AVAST YE SWAPS: REPEL THE INVADERS!"
---
18, right out of highschool for myself.
---
I hope the answer is to heal, otherwise you are wrong :P
---
I mean you can’t use meld in combat so unless you like ambushing people or base sitting with a stealth cat I’d go dwarf any day over ne.
---
Blizzard has always been OK with multi-boxing.
---
Nelf or dwarf for pvp? Also do i get engineering at 60 or early on? What pets for pvp?
---
It's been really fun. It's so much more challenging, you really need help with a lot of the quests. I mean even soloing normal mobs. If you pull more than two mobs, you could really be in trouble. Each pull requires planning and some tactics. It's so much more fun and engaging than the mindless slog current wow has become. Grouping feels encouraged and if I am killing some mobs in the area for a quest I will almost always be invited to a group or invite whoever else is around.
---
There's a real sense of accomplishment when you level. Choosing a talent point, making sure you have enough money to buy your new spells. 
---
I'm an adult and have a FT job and family, so I can't no life it like I might have 15 years ago, but I still am having a great time with a few hours here and there!
---
Called BETA for a reason.
---
Make sure to group up for better chances at tagging mobs
---
Keep in mind shadowmeld in combat in vanilla. So its uses are feign death into shadowmeld to eat in combat for a sec/slightly more confusion than just feign death alone, or to hide by a flag or afk to get a beer in STV. Most the time you will be feign deathing to land a trap instead of melding. I personally think dwarf is better for pvp.
---
The comment I was waiting for.
---
Is this a late April Fools post?
---
It's way beyond tryhard.  There's a technical explanation of layering [here](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/05/22/episode-105-beta-impressions-layering-technically-explained-kevin-jordan-on-wow-mmos-blizzard/).  Listen from 1:12:45.  Talks about how people could exploit layers and why it's tougher than you think.
---
The Mythic+ loot casino is a huge part of the problem with retail... In classic I know what gear I need, where it drops, and that I need to kill X over and over till I get it, I don't want a stupid cache.  Otherwise, Mythic+ Classic dungeons with no rewards would be okay, no gear, not pets, no mounts, nothing, just to say you did it.
---
It means you can roll on all of the things.
---
Agreed...
---
Honestly I didn't see the idea as everyman content, but more of a no-lifer perk.
---
Good points though.
---
did you play the first stress test? the exact same thing happened.
---
they want to stress test the login servers, layering. why do you think the level cap is so low
---
Potentially it means Hunters only need 8% hit instead of 9% hit.
---
What will you be using for a guild bank? An alt on the guild masters acc or a high ranked guild member?
---
Na. The guys an idiot, it's your personal property you can do whatever the hell you like as long as you're not on the road. Do donuts in your front yard if you want. Just because you moved your car out of a garage does not mean you'll get plastered and drive downtown. In the literal sense, yes its drinking and driving but it's not illegal in anyway to take a fifth to the dome and move your car from one parking spot over to the next one. Bunch of self righteous insecure dickheads trying to make themselves feel better. Lol
---
Hi, /u/grizzlesax
---
Real life loot boxes? Nah. If they would like to add the things you got from the codes to the game they could do so as reputation rewards or super rare world drops.
---
People aren’t downvoting because it’s a bug. People are downvoting because of the post title. People act like it’s supposed to work flawlessly and sarcastically say things like “ don’t worry layering is fine”. How about just outline he bug without the sarcastic complaining? And before people jump on me, I upvoted OP.
---
Is the DC different from collision DCs? Because if that causes it they've literally been unable to fix the random DC you get from bumping into objects at speed since vanilla. 
---
It's gotten less common but even in BfA there were points where you'd hit the corner of some stairs and just DC.
---
One of my 120s is a warlock. With the azerite shield ability plus the warlock Demon Skin talent at a 395 ilvl, I'm pretty sure two 120 non-elite mobs could not hurt him faster than his shields regenerate. Maybe 3. And when he hit 120, pathetically weak, even with a pet.
---
What are you, a referee? All those words and you still haven't told me your own opinion. Are you capable of original thought? Or do you just reduce everything to an argument that you need to win?

---
What private server did you play on that never had instability issues? Everyone that I played on regularly had long maintenance's and periods where servers were down. 
---
And also I disagree with your notion that private servers had more populated servers then classic wow itself did, I'd love to see your source on that information.
---
🎶 *Just imagine you're out there swatting lies in the making!* 🎶
---
Thank you!
---
I forgot about this!
---
As a new player. Isnt it boring doing the same few raids over and over without any progress in upgrading gear? I also dont like the redundance of old gear when a new expansion comes out but you somehow have to keep the game interesting. Blizzard just went the wrong way by making every expansion solely about bigger numbers. 
---
I know you cant really compare it but Path of Exile, pretty much the best ARPG ever existed (yes even better than D2) gets a new content league every few months and a major expansion every year. And its not about bigger numbers. New content, new hard enemies, new interesting gear and mechanics, rework of skills/classes, endgame areas and existing gear. 
---
Theres definitely ways to keep expansions interesting, its just that higher numbers are the easy way.
---
You sound like a fuckin idiot man.
---
I’m saying it’s not that different from how it usually is. If Asmon or Soda are online, everyone is watching them. It doesn’t matter if you’re streaming something different or not.
---
Plus they are seriously strong in 1v1. I'm currently going rogue at launch but spriest looks so tempting especially after a few days dueling at 60 on private servers, they are a bitch to fight.
---
There definitely needs to be space for #nochanges servers, but I'm hoping for more options eventually.
---
As a roleplayer transmog is great.
---
What about hunter ranged hit cap tho
---
Ok.
---
In vanilla I kept our stuff on an alt and put a log of everything there on our guild site. Anytime anyone needed something they just messaged me and I sent it to them. This time I'll probably do something similar with an alt and a Google spreadsheet on our discord.
---
Exactly my thoughts. I mean you get paid to game, then you really do have the time afterwords to truly enjoy the game anonymously.
---
No this was well known.
---
Racials to me aren't as important as liking the way you look imo. Depending on how quickly you level you might want to get gathering professions from 1-60 to give you a little more liquid cash as engineering can be expensive. For pvp pet get Broken Tooth. It's a cat in the badlands with a 1.0 attack speed which destroys casters with the knock back to cast speed.
---
Classic + hasn't been defined, but I am not talking about them restarting the expansion cycle, I just think it would be cool if classic+ had an approach to itemization that is in line with vanilla class design. There is clearly a disconnect between the class/game design when you have things like MP5 and spirit co-existing.
---
&gt;This sounds like something from Diablo or Legion.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It also sounds ridiculously hard to balance.
---
I don't get the why you're making reference to Diablo and Legion, but  "1% hit while using 2-handed swords" wouldn't be "ridiculously hard to balance" compared to a flat 1% hit. And again, what exactly does 1% crit offer that agility or intellect don't? It just bypasses what primary do and contributes to faster power creep.   
---
I guess my main concern is having secondary bonuses that do what primary stats do - I'm not opposed to secondary bonuses. You completely glossed over my point about how many talents and racials are undermined by stats like crit, ap, and mp5. I don't think #nochanges is the philosophy that drove what made vanilla great in the first place -  why not make it better? Maybe all it would take is new items, but there would be more room for "post-naxx" if the power creep wasn't so strong.
---
I don't have a link, but Kevin Jordan has expressed on his stream that he opposed putting things like +% crit on items.
---
Gs
---
Merging has as many downsides as layering. There is no perfect answer.
---
Are they all playing on pvp servers ?
---
Because of the LAUNCH. Blizzards servers can easily hold more than any private server can. Keep in mind they’re keeping realm pops at a particular cap to recreate an authentic experience while still keeping a healthy realm status. You are the epitome of someone complaining simply to complain with absolutely no knowledge. GTFO.
---
It certainly is a treasure.
---
They are saying they will try pvp first. I doubt they will stick with it for long.
---
Old school Rune Scape style? Might be interesting, but it's definitely more of a investment on the Blizz side so we'll see how it goes.
---
Priest
---
Until they say they're dropping layering, the war wages on.
---
Different teams dude. Yeah its both blizz but I'm pretty sure Classic had its own team of devs during the BFA beta so they aren't the same people. Maybe a small number of them transferred over on an as needed basis but its likely two entirely different teams and since retail is still a thing they're most likely still separate teams.
---
I'd like to make a Power-Ballads-of-the-80s-style infomercial with these kinds of posts scrolling down.
---
Pretty sure the going theory was that there was always a 1% chance to miss regardless. With that proven false, gear lists won't change either way.
---
*Stormwind
---
Always prefer the holy route till at least 40 myself. 
---
I am a very social player and you really don't lose much until 36-40 anyway. And you gain healing ability. Kinda sad WSG will not be off bat. Healing Focus is super good for that.
---
At 40 shadow is then for sure superior for hitting 60. But then again dungeons start getting harder, more so when your tanks are off/hybrid spec.
---
Strangely, I actually liked Heirlooms when they were first released, but once I started leveling a paladin in WOTLK I realized how awful it actually was. You blow through dungeons without any challenge, you don't get exciting gear upgrades, and if you do, they barely matter because your heirloom gear is so powerful. So I was wrong.
---
In terms of Transmog? That's the patch I quit the game. I still think transmog should've been client-side only, because it ruined a lot of the "feel" of the game to me, though I suppose that's hard to put into words. Wow soon became a fashion show, and I could no longer suspend my disbelief.
---
Hey Jern,
---
Give this a look:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI)
---
On 1.12 clients its 8.6% against raid bosses. Is this Blue post rounding down for simplicity's sake or is it ACTUALLY 8.00% on the dot?
---
joy of pvp server
---
Some do, retail is too borked rn for them/me.
---
Since wotlk, I never had to level 1-80 with a scaling. Feelsgoodman.
---
i'm biased here but i think drustvar and nazmir are the most unique looking zones from bfa. the former in particular had me awed when i stumbled upon it during sunset. the rest of the bfa zones are admittedly pretty, but not all that unique (tho i do like that they added another desert zone), and the fact that they're all such a pain in the ass to navigate + designed as a game level before a world makes you not really want to stop and appreciate what beauty it has
---
Well. I totally can see how it must look from their POV...
---
Random guy comes, yells "INVITE".
---
Your mob disappears because of a flawed new system. 
---
There are definitely people whod gladly abuse this stuff. Even including streamers. NOT saying the streamer did it, he clearly wasnt expecting it and genuinly sorry. But via text chat you simply wont know.
---
For fair play 1v1, Hunter and Mage are the best classes. You need Engineering for maximum results.
---
For random world PvP, probably Rogue.

In fairness to Blizzard, that's just how any mmo with a level progression system works when an expansions is released and the level cap raised. The only way keep the same feel for the world would be to add new higher level zones dispersed among the existing ones, rather than creating a separate area like a new continent or a new world. And then also adjusting the levels of mobs so the older zones that were the most popular for high-level characters don't become ghost towns. That way you have some of the old content mixing with the new content, and you're left with one cohesive world after an expansion rather than what is basically just an addon that ignores previous content. 
---
I thought how they added the zones in Cata was, in part, a decent attempt at that, except it was too late. You had to leave Azeroth from level 58-80, and then when you came back a lot of the cata zones weren't actually part of the world because they were only accessible via flying mounts or physically gated by a high level quest. Never understood why they couldn't have new high level zones be accessible to low level players. When I was brand new in Vanilla I made an UD mage and around level 11 walked into the WPL. I learned real quick that I should not do that again. I don't need a mechanic that prevents me from learning that and splits the world apart.
---
For people wondering or potentially confused, here is a post detailing hit cap in vanilla which lines up perfectly with what Blizzard is saying here.
---
https://retro-wow.com/forum/printthread.php?tid=4288
---
TL;DR is that everything is working as expected in Classic
---
Not really a good thing if competitivenes is based on lots of abusive mechanics...
---
Yeah I know 0 friends who don't like transmog and only a couple that don't like heirlooms. Both seem to be popular features.
---
I just jacked my dick until it sploded all over the carpet
---
Uhhh....No? BfA proved this wrong, 8.1s PTR proved this wrong.
---
We need to keep holding them account.

Not to bump an old thread but I can confirm that regular snowballs has a knockdown effect, which you can read about if you also check out the classic wowhead page for them:

Good point, I'm sure a good few people that originally played vanilla, devolved into the "elitist know it all toxicity", vs the people that started after dungeon finder.
---
I hopeful that we won't have to worry as much, with the large outpouring of sentiment generally leaning towards how great the majority of the original communities were.
---
It's mostly people conflating "layering is a nice compromise and won't be nearly as damaging as reactionaries say" with "layering is perfectly implemented and bug-free, there are no problems with the current beta implementation".
---
The best way for Classic to survive is to just add more PvP and PvE opportunities beneath the Naxx threshold. Add more "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" raids. Add new dungeons, possibly 10 man dungeons. Fill in the empty zones with new questing areas. Add content that doesn't add powercreep.
---
So you think Classic Wow will have zero issues? I'll bet you any amount of $ they have just as much issues as private servers, if not more. Even with they're beloved layering. Private servers have a bigger pop on their server in a single "layer" than classic will. They did just fine without layering, but Blizz can't do it. They're smart enough to know sharding would kill the game, a lot smarter than Blizz.
---
I'd be fine with show off heroics, reskins for Naxx gear would be cool to.
---
Updated my original post a little.
---
Great summary! Heirlooms made alts baby mode, but you can't really justify NOT using them. I'd rather they not exist in the first place, so I don't feel like I am doing it wrong.
---
I always thought people that died in raid / m+ were just afk on facebook or something...
---
Today I learned that some people actually have to focus so hard on their rotation that they can't dodge anything.
---
Back up.
---
My favorite part is fishing/cooking/FA giving you a true upper hand while leveling if you took the effort to utilize them.
---
Why was it even reported as a bug then??
---
I got a lvl 13 green dagger last night on a pr and let out an audible "fk yeah!" as it was such a huge upgrade from my white dagger. I can't remember the last time I felt like that on retail hahaha.
---
\&gt; Downvoted the BfA shill.
---
You're being toxic. Stop.
---
A subscription is enough.
---
Also you cannot even buy the expansions from Wrath -&gt; BFA, your account is automatically at "Legion" level, there's only 3 types of accounts. Starter, Everything including Legion and BFA.
---
All you need is an active subscription.
---
WC last two bosses are harder, but if your team has cc or interrupts WC is easier. Most people have issue is there are a lot of mobs that heal, sleep , and cast a hot on themselves in WC. 
---
DM is a positioning and pull time issue. A lot of mobs running and grabbing another pack... or two. Where as  most of the time in WC this isn't an issue.
---
Both have their difficulties. But neither are hard.. until your all low level and by the end you are getting resists and misses and they are crushing the shit out of your tank.
---
Kang here I come
---
No, if you are invited to a group you get xp (at least partial) and chance at loot.
---
I like there being one difficulty that varies, for instance the first couple bosses should be easier and it ramps up. 
---
I also like there being different tiers of content with multiple raids per tier for people to go at their own pace (maybe dabble in each say do 2 bosses in one raid and 1 boss in another whole working on the others do each week you're getting upgrades to help with progression) and a community that doesn't look down on guilds not in the latest and greatest tier as being lesser.
---
Well scaling should involve mechanics and atleast some "fixed" values like armor doesnt scale as much down as health or crit doesnt scale down as much as raw damage. Just examples. But you get my point. Scaling is a fun concept, but a simple % multiplier on every stat seems lazy as fuck lol.
---
Back down.
---
...and back down. Dashed hopes.
---
Private servers made Classic happen, people need to put some respecc on their name
---
wHY cAn'T I LoG In?! BLiZZ wTF?!!
---
Plus the shit ton of gold gifts they will get to afford their mounts without having to grind or do professions.
---
Night elf hunter
---
Who are they being an asshat toward? Blizzard? Boo fucking hoo.
---
Only things you can really do is skip the starting zone by making a group of 3-5 and grinding on level 5 mobs til ur lvl 5. Other than that the only way to avoid congestion is to get and stay ahead of the pack by playing 20+ hours straight on release. Don't level by exploration - that's slow as shit. Just quest, skip quests that are taking too long and grind anything you can snag.
---
that's not how math works.
---
Imagine that for some people, $1200 is like $1.20, or even $12, to you.
---
I'm in the same boat and plan to play a mage. Sure there will be content I can't do but I will have inbuilt tools for fast travel and money making. Able to aoe farm and good dps so easy to find a dungeon spot if I have time for group content.
---
Gotta level those pets as you go. I remember taking low lvl pets into dungeons, no one cared as long as you're not BM.
---
This is a pretty reasonable take. I love transmog (mixed feelings on heirlooms) and farming old content for looks is really fun in retail for me. In classic, looking how you look adds some immersion for sure.
---
So, IMO, the added secondary stats add depth to character customization. Choosing between stacking crit on a Mage or going for Int or going for SP are all different playstyles . Streamlining them all to be through Int would reduce customization choices.
---
Thinking about it, a lot of stats *could* be condensed in Classic. But that would be changing the whole stat system, a la what the did in Cata.
---
As for the balance of these items, generally, the more specific a bonus gets, the harder it is going to be to balance it for all classes, specs, and situation.
---
i agree, i wish it wasnt either
---
Not really what I was asking about
---
12k hours in 4(?) years.
---
3k hours per year.
---
~8h a day.
---
I got 10k hours or more in PoE since 2013. 1 year break. So 10k/5, thats 2k h a year. And i thought my addiction is serious.
---
The other thing vanilla did which massively helps with this is making gear drops extremely rare.
---
If you were progressing BWL you were very unlikely to have all the upgrades from MC so MC was worth running.
---
In modern wow drops are so frequent there’s no reason to run old content because the gear is worthless even for a casual player after 2-3 weeks of a new tier
---
Arms is fun to level, with SS, MS and WW, it's pretty fun to pull a bunch of mobs, cleave them, rinse repeat. Having said that, Arms will never be what Fury is in a raid environment simply because Fury can pump out more damage and get more rage faster. You can do okay as an Arms in a raid, even up to AQ, but if you care about clearing fast you go Fury. In AQ and after, it's kind of a hindrance to use Arms for PvE. On another note arms is great leveling and if you're in a pvp server, gives you a bunch better chance of surviving l.
---
This.
---
If you're used to mythic raiding in the last 3-4 expansions dont expect anything difficult in terms of mechanics/difficulty of boss battles. You will be disappointed. 
---
Its very unlikely you will progress a raid boss in classic for days/weeks like you do on retail if you're raiding with at least decent people. Raids will be cleared rather quick and then its just farming.
---
I have unfinished business with him. We got to him once with 1 not serious attempt, then TBC released so we never went back.
---
As someone in a similar situation. He is aware and definitely not bragging.
---
I don't want to be in the beta but ok
---
It was not well known at all, in fact this goes in direct contradiction with the screenshots of people missing with 8% hit back in vanilla.
---
Be nice if the rest of us can get a "people who don't constantly think about streamers" layer as well.
---
Blood Fury is 25% base melee attack power. Death wish is 20% all physical damage. They are completely different things lol, how could they add up to 45%?
---
Not exactly, but the way I see it, first attack power happens. That new attack power level is what dictates the damage of your hits. This won't be 25%, probably. Then those hits deal 20% more damage than they would have otherwise.
---
World of Diablo, give them another shot at making a WoD that didn't fall flat.
---
It won't do anything, people just get excited in their boredom.
---
Can't go to war if you don't look cute.
---
Attack power and physical dmg are not the same thing.
---
This about dota. Not wow
---
Doesn't mention the 3% crit reduction npc's 3 levels above you have according to the bluepost.
---
If you’re a new 60 you’ll still have to work your way through though. You can’t just jump into naxx.
---
In retail you’d just be handed loads of normal/heroic naxx level gear for doing next to nothing the second you hit max level making doing any old content pointless
---
GM here, hybrids will be allowed.
---
My priorities will be 1) Filling spots 2) Effort towards success (farming BiS, consumables,  etc) 3) Perfomance 
---
Oh, and 0) Drama avoidance

BT is a lioness!
---
So blizzard changed those values for Classic? I mean a proof from vanilla cant really be messed with.
---
you should try out twinking
---
How would they block the names of other characters?
---
Every server is going to have a character named Asmongold, they could very feasibly do it by hiding enough key information
---
I am hitting about 200 fps at almost max settings in the starting zones. I know that will have to come down just a bit for raids but yeah if the added multi-core and multi thread to it we could see a steady 200 through raids.

Just for reference.
---
Keep in mind hunter has a low skill floor (noob friendly before 60), but very high skill ceiling, kiting/pet management, fd+trap, trackings, aspects switch. If you learn the class, you'll love it, otherwise you'll hate yourself if you let people abuse your deadzone.
---
Buy truckloads of mats from AH during layered period when reaource nodes have multiple instances (ie huge surplus, cheap values because of limited gold) and hord that shit until after layering.
---
I disagree. I used to run the old content for either gold or to experience the story. It was a rare thing on my list for sure, but I think what we lose by adding it is more than what we gain personally.
---
Starting as undead and going from level 4 wolves to level 50 undead right next door in the plaguelands.... that was epic. Something to aspire to.
---
Is some of this just because its the beta (no real reason to level and gear out a character since they'll get wiped) and theres nothing better to do?  Just can't imagine people would want to do this on launch rather than gear up their own character
---
I mean, they could turn names off, hide chat, block tooltips with black boxes or adjust the screen
---
What I don’t like about scaling is it still isn’t classic. I’m totally okay with my max ilvl super powerful has killed every raid boss on hardest difficulty main to get some degree of challenge in the world—frankly, I wish they’d make durotar to Zandalar a 120 zone at 120. 
---
That said at this point, leveling is so pointless they should just scrap it altogether. The default new character should start at 110. 
---
But the fact remains, even with the legion fixes that slowed it down, it’s still stupid fast—even w/o heirlooms. Regardless of how many expansions we are into the game, leveling should take 5-10 days /played. Previous leveling should only be nerfed (or buffed depending on your perspective) when new leveling is added in order to keep 1-max a 200ish hour experience. 
---
I’m really excited for leveling and grinding to return. Imo, 1-60 in Vanilla, especially on a fresh server, is the best experience in rpgs and arguably in video games, period.
---
I know I sucked for sure.  I was clicking my buttons exactly like the rogue in that video in SFK.
---
&gt;Fury was cool, but I felt strange dual-wielding as a warrior, and missed taking huge chunks of HP out with one swing.
---
Keep in mind that in vanilla (especially so while leveling), fury does not necessarily mean dual-wield. When people tell you to try fury, they generally mean a two-handed slam build.
---
&gt;Hell, even in raids, a decently-geared arms warrior could put up some serious numbers. Maybe not top of the board competitive, but good nonetheless.
---
Also keep in mind that while arms is capable of what *looks like* competitive DPS, they have the unfortunate drawback that they can't use their signature ability because it would knock more important buffs off of their targets. If Mortal Strike repeatedly knocks off Elements, Shadows, or Sunder, the raid's total output can end up being lower than if the warrior wasn't even there. If you also spec into deep wounds, your casters will get very upset with you (speaking from my own experience).
---
That said, I won't judge. I'm just here to inform, so you go smack things in whatever way your heart tells you.
---
If you're going to act like a child don't complain when people treat you like one.
---
If they havent changed anything I did this all the time.
---
I used to try to "power level" myself.
---
Anyone else get d/ced over and over again?
---
If you’re interested, we’re definitely recruiting!

---
Yes.  Can’t even kill a mob
---
What he lie about?
---
I used to like him but latley I find hes all about that base.
---
Me, I don't care much for Vanilla. Mainly because class balance and design is utter shit. 
---
TBC and wrath got it far better even cata. 
---
I don't mind the hybrid tax, but you have to get something for the tax.  Like you never need a ret pally, enh/ele shaman, or feral/bal druid. Its a bad idea to bring them. And the argument is always some BULL like buffs, you mean the same buffs that those classes healing spec give? 
---
I guess ret get imp might, so 100 ap which is if most all your raid was physical i guess could make up for it. (Still better off with a healer with it, as its only 5 points to get.)
---
I was hoping they would add idk 2 more leather items with defense on them so druids could play a tank end game. Shit like that, its fine that it is literally Vanilla wow. But Vanilla wow has massive issues.
---
But i much prefer the old wow. I liked playing with friends instead of whatever you call wow today, raid logging, loot explosion?
---
I don’t think that’s true of ulduar at all.
---
You couldn’t just walk into ulduar as soon as you dinged you needed to farm some tier 7 gear first because ulduar was pretty hard other than Razorscale and Flame Leviathan. And because there was no dungeons or other free gear with tier 8 you had to run naxx to gear for ulduar.
---
TOC is where play the patch started with the TOC dungeon handing out ulduar gear for free and toc10 being phenomenally easy.
---
Yeah, but you probably won’t pick it back up again anyway. The Bloodvine set is BoE, you don’t need to be a tailor to use it.
---
How old is it?
---
F
---
I could see it being really useful for that! I would rather see people just equip the real armor though than use current armor that looks just like it.
---
Bc before the leveling nerf, dailies and removal of attunements had that. 
---
Due to the attunements, you couldn’t skip tiers, leveling took 200-250 hours from 1-70, and you had to put in effort to stabilize your economy.
---
The glancing section on there is wrong btw.
---
Alamo teaches to play drood

Actually, unknowingly, indirectly having a boomkin was making things much harder and not helping.

Still I wonder what will happen to classic servers when BC then WotLK servers are released "we all know those are enevtible
---
Yes repeatedly.
---
Thanks, used these to debug some crashes and fixed it also using this to underclock my GPU.
---
Layering carries game breaking immersion and abuse / cheats along with it. What good is a decent launch when the entire game is wrecked? If it's for launch only, why can it be in there until the start of phase 2? That's if we believe what they say. It was supposed to be no changes, then sharding only in the starting zones for the first few days, to now layering the entire continents for months. I don't believe them, at all. It's not about the launch... the evidence is all around you, but you can't see. It's lazy &amp; easy, and makes them the most $. That's it. $50 Demo, paid sub for even a chance at Beta, Streamers only getting beta, paid character names early, etc. It's all about the $, open your eyes.
---
Blizzard do you fuckin idiots ever learn
---
You can’t run two instances of WoW on one machine without a VM and VMs suck for gaming. Nearly all multi-account players have one physical machine per account.

*When presented with the opportunity to reflect and improve them self, reddit user /u/*[***Mechanon84***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mechanon84/) *instead chose to act even more immature. It appeared that this citizen of the internet was quite content playing the fool.*
---
&gt;Add content that doesn't add powercreep.
---
Exactly. Especially raids and dungeons can be made hard by adding mechanics, new gear, rework of stats or whatever. No need for powercreep.
---
These formulas are server side not client side. Its not 8.6% on 1.12 that was just one of the theories, this post confirms the 8% theory.
---
Agree with this. I’m personally all for a bc server as that’s when I initially got into the game and there stuff I didn’t get to experience that I want to, however in no way do I want it to affect classic servers as other people specifically only want those. 
---
My ideal situation is eventually after classic has been out a while and a decent amount of people have been clearing naxx for some time, blizz announces a tbc server. This would be a new server separate from the classic ones and you would have the option of copying your character from the classic server onto tbc or starting a new character on the new server.
---
How else is it supposed to work?
---
join a guild in advance or make friends asap in game.
---
SO NICE to finally have an RPG back again.  DO NOT sacrifice these elements for "accessibility".
---
Will you be on EU or NA realms? I'm hoping to find a guild before classic comes out. Got raid experience up to the first boss of AQ40 from back in Vanilla, no private server experience though.
---
Keep relogging in combat &amp; getting dc'd over &amp; over again lol.  The world server is down message keeps reappearing in between each login.
---
Hard Modes specifically in Ulduar/ToC&amp;TOGC didn't ruin the game.
---
No, it's a bottle of wine.
---
getting a raid spot as one of the most played classes isnt very hard because they are wanted in numbers, raids will have like 6 warriors and 6 mages and good number of rogues.       However if you want to play something like a druid its going to be near impossible to get a raid slot.
---
&gt;toxic
---
lol. i'm also wearing rose colored glasses and i think i do but i don't.
---
Nice, I like your line of thinking. What race are you going? I've always been Horde but willing to try Alliance.
---
ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
---
The no changes crowd will also bitch about being able to reorder your characters on the CSS, they'll complain about everything.
---
&gt; There has also never been a period in WoW's history where "relevant content" was an area as large as Classic WoW. So, since BC, we have been playing in a smaller relevant game world than the one at launch.
---
Well that's just not true at all lol.
---
No, it doesn't. It's not even close. Merging is a part of the life cycle of an MMO. Even with their layering, there will probably be mergers at some point. It's unavoidable. Sharding is easily avoidable though.
---
Huh. Southshore?

&gt;World server down

its literally always been that way with xpacs though, thats not a new retail thing.
---
Weren’t looms a Wrath thing? 
---
Pre nerf Bc was classic 2.0 with flying and arenas. Dailies were added, 1-60 was nerfed, and attunements were eased. Any semblance of “hardcore” WoW was mortally wounded there. 
---
You can point to yogg 0, HLK, r rag, etc. etc. as evidence of hardcore, but that’s a totally different conception to what hardcore meant in mmos up to that point. 
---
That said, I don’t see why we can’t have a vanilla/per nerf Bc “hardcore” experience coupled with modern “hardcore” group pve content. Seems such an obvious product to make.
---
That's not true at all. You can run multiple clients at once on one PC just fine.
---
Classic does have way more interesting gearing and class feel, but it does have drawbacks. There are many classes with 1 viable spec, and I'm not even just talking if you want to raid, there are just talent trees that are functionally dead.
---
I guess I still want that over bland ones though.
---
eso has this exact concept yet people babyrage at it the whole time.
---
I feel bad for you, everything's been smooth for 15 mn on my end.
---
1/40 for a druid in MC.....very limited.

---
Almost everything involved in a hunter's skill ceiling can be managed with macros and addons, including dead zone, max range and autoshot time. It's easy as hell to play at a competent level.
---
Probably the most valuable skill a hunter can have (out in the world and PvP) that will elevate them above others is the management of their pets' cooldowns and abilities. Environmental awareness and predictive play is up there too but people who put their pets' abilities on auto make me cry.
---
You actually can with separate accounts.
---
The reason for that crit reduction is because of the way the hit table works, which is described in the link.  The blue post doesn't actually explain why that crit reduction happens, or hits effect on it, but the numbers line up with the expected values.
---
Only 90g :)
---
Yep, i agree, that's essentially what i was getting at. If i were to raid seriously as dps on a warrior, i would go fury easily.
---
Undead is usually bis for hoard gnome is bis for alliance especially with the 5% intellect racial that gnomes have
---
Don't you always have a 1% miss chance no matter what? Or was that for spell hit?
---
Any place you can recommend trying to find a guild? Or just look in game once it launches?
---
Alright awesome, are hunters much needed or not really? I really enjoy the concept of a hunter and their playstyle but will likely go a warrior as it's more practical I suppose.
---
If that's true, looks like they forgot a simple check if (all_players_on_same_layer())
---
human starting area?
---
Just a friendly reminder to let me play in a way that if i see you being shit i kick you or make fun of you. 
---
See how big brain that position of yours is. If some people play as jerks. Why are you trying to be a dick and tell them not to?
---
I'm heavily horde on BFA and haven't really ever done alliance. I hate the layout of storm wind but Ironforge is the capital in vanilla because of its proximity to raid content. Love Ironforge so I'm going to go human mage and try to recreate as much magic as possible by keeping it new. How about you?
---
Wanna be anonymous ? Don't stream. It's that simple.

They clearly have the money to just disapear for 6months. Sure they'll lose followers and subs but you have to make a choice.

This is league of legends streamers all over again.
---
You're making bank just playing video games at home. Stop complaining about people watching you and trying to interact with you.
---
NA, not strictly looking for people with experience, looking for people who want to have fun with each other. Alliance pvp.
---
Is it picky to say I hate how gear looks on gnomes?
---
The bluepost is quite clear that if you have a 4% chance to crit a level 60 mob you'll have a 1% chance to crit a level 63. Even without taking the crit cap into account.
---
Not since MoP.
---
Yeah those are really populated classes, it may be difficult for you to find space in a pug, and when you do get in a raid you're going to be splitting the loot with quite a lot of others making it harder to get gear than say a Druid.
---
 But that shouldn't stop you from playing the class you want to play, there's going to be a lot of guilds raiding when classic launches, much more than P-severs. So you as a Warrior/Rouge/Hunter/Mage you probably won't have people constantly sending you messages to join their guild/raid , you should still be able to find groups pretty easily if you ask around.
---
Are you orc?
---
are the cities fucked? just went into ironforge and now i cant see anything, logged out and now says world server is down
---
Is this suicide or rebirth?
---
During stress test there were literally ~300 people in every starting zone and it was unstable. Any more and it would be literally unplayable.
---
that guy is now the president of blizzard, lul
---
What? Hit cap was 8% in vanilla, too. Where is this 9% coming from?
---
There's already a video of some streamer swapping between 3 different layers to get rare mineral veins
---
Not picky at all. You should only worry about what race to pick if you are going min/max otherwise pick what you want
---
Yep, the OP is literally saying don't play how you want to let other play how they want to... sad.
---
I think spell power was an after-thought when designing vanilla. It feels really tacked-on. I think the intention was that gear with all 5 primaries would be optimal for a paladin or shaman.  The problem with having hyper-optimized gear is that it really leaves hybrid play-styles behind in the leveling process where all classes are just looking at the 5 primaries. A druid feels more balanced in his role at lower levels, for example. But I do see your point about int and spell power for a mage.  
---
One other concern I'd have is what would horizontal itemization offer to Warriors for example? Their gear is already extremely well optimized and they're pretty much the only class who can perform all its roles very well.
---
Yes, tranq shot is big. Should have 3 or so hunters per raid.
---
Well to be fair most his videos you are made by like those Best moment and clips videos channels. He does not choose most of those thumbnails. Now i have not really looked at his channel to see if he does it him self.

---
&gt;If someone cares enough to minmax and ensure they have the proper spec for raiding they are by default going to care more and try harder than an equally random someone who does not care about minmaxing and does not have the proper spec.
---
My entire WoW experience from Vanilla to Cataclysm tells me this is wrong. Legions of dude that are try-hard in their attitude (coming online 2h pre raid every night just to farm their food buffs etc), were entirely bad gameplay wise.
---
The typical PvE players that could not exist when facing PvP situations where you had to be fast and clever were not just a cliche. They were the majority of people filling PvE guilds.
---
Now of course that I presented a false dichotomy, it was mostly to illustrate more than to describe accurately. ^^
---
Honestly all my raiding experience in WoW is that as a good player from a technical POV, you'll become one of the most important raiders from your guild instantly. Only the top of the top guilds in the world have only rock stars filling their raid.
---
I know it's mn, same group of people I refer to.
---
This isn't true at all, I multi box characters for leveling purposes and didn't even start doing it until Warlords of Draenor.
---
Basically everyone besides Rogues had a raid buff of some sort and they were never shelved. It was indeed the “bring the player not the class” mentality which is just about the stupidest philosophy in an RPG.
---
As im going to be completely new to vanilla/classic, i do want to experience this with my friends and am genuinely curious of the rates as well. i also favor efficiency thats why. any thoughts about this turning into a blue post at some point that blizzard will address? or if the information will be released before release?
---
Great advice!
---
But has anyone figured out how much weapon skill exactly matters? that has always been a grey zone on private servers, knowledge wise.
---
The only problem is if the streamer stops playing or changes server, suddenly your server might lose most of its playerbase, i think that happened before but i dont remember which streamer was it.
---
Private server dev here, some historical context: We never knew for sure what hit formula vanilla used, there were three prevailing theories: 8%, 8.6% and 9%.  
---
The 8% formula came from Beaza, this guy came out of nowhere at the end of vanilla and started adding a bunch of formulas to wowwiki. Some people speculated he worked for Blizzard but when asked for evidence or research he never provided them so the formulas were quickly reverted. 
---
There's also the screenshots people posted on EJ of people missing with 8% hit: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51063082/58592248-0a0d4f00-8236-11e9-83a8-eeccc624b8ca.jpg  
---
This contradicts what Blizzard just posted but it could be explained by the formula changing on earlier patches.  
---
If the 8% formula is indeed correct it gives more credibility to Beaza's other formulas, namely the glancing reduction one. I did a quick check and it seems to match the glancing data people have been gathering on the beta.
---
Its also very similar to the confirmed WOTLK glancing formula, its the same but with a slight variation. I posted about it here: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5#issuecomment-497167237
---
This was before they upgraded the hardware and introduced new servers. The ONLY servers that had queues were highly populated, hardcore servers like Illidan. Even than, they offered free transfers off the server if you didn't like queueing.
---
That is a solution, layering is just a cheap bandaid.
---
It’s true. It has high damage and a chance on hit to do AOE damage. If the tank has it, it helps him hold threat. If another melee has it and the proc goes off at the wrong time (ex: early in a fight) it can grab aggro.
---
Most people give it to tank, then off-tanks and other warriors before rogues.
---
Less DPS, you're not going to be in range for the howl buff, no stealth.
---
Fironia Vie
---
Can't stay logged in for more than 30 seconds in the NELF starting area.
---
I always prefered storm wind over ironforge honestly for me it's easier to get around in
---
You can't have 7.9 or whatever cause items only ever have 1% or 2% hit
---
Druid is a true joy to level. They move quickly through content (15% / 30% movement speed level 20 / 21 talent, 40% at 30) and don't rely on weapons to scale dps (for feral). You can meet any party need if you keep intellect gear on you. You can use creativity and your knowledge of the class to solo a lot of tough world content and it's super satisfying when a plan comes together. Hardcore players throw shade at druids for max level raiding, but don't listen to them. As for Kalimdor... you'll likely have to do some leveling there eventually. Tanaris is one of the only zones for mid 40s. oh and swim form quest is fun!
---
Alright thank you so much! So pretty much just keep looking for a guild and eventually you'll hit one?
---
Do you mean server? You don't get to pick your layer
---
Sept is the prefix for scepter, prove me wrong.
---
I think they upped it to like 4-5 by the end of vanilla.
---
I think it was like 2-3 at launch or something. My numbers are probably off, but I remember it being a big complaint and being buffed at some point.
---
3 bugs, one of them to do with social media integration. I really fucking hope they have an internal list somewhere.
---
Theres no hard cap on melee / ranged attack hit chance, only spells.
---
Yeah, if you expand the game, but then crunch one part of it, did it really expand?
---
Vanilla content should still be relevant to new players!
---
hunter druid? Play defensive. Use crowd control / mana burns and distance yourselves.
---
hunter shaman? same deal. snare Totem / frost shock / trap, get some distance, mana burn, rest is simple.
---
hunter paladin? Again, same deal, play defensive.. and might buff the pet / mana buff hunter.
---
all 3 are solid pvp combo's.
---
Just play a private classic server; they're free, and give you the same experience.
---
this isnt how its been in beta/demo and ive reported it to blizz in both.
---
Do you have to ask permission for an hour a day of alone time for other hobbies. 
---
If my missus said I couldn’t work on my car on the weekend, go for a run, or dick around on reddit she’d be out the door.
---
Obviously that doesn’t apply directly when you have a wife you love and two kids, but if you have absolutely zero alone time, you need to work something out for your health, wow aside, it’s not normal to be ‘on’ 100% of the time. You need a break like everyone else does.
---
I feel sorry for you bro. Family is good and all that, but when you have to ask permission for sonething you clearly have passion for, that’s not cool.
---
Just accept it and set your family first. 
---
Play at night maybe ? Sneak out and play a few hours. 
---
Or be a man and put your foot down; “honey, I will be playing video games this year. I will contribute to the family as usual, but wow is my hobby now”
---
LFG Mondays here on this subreddit, or the classic wow discord are great areas to find guilds.
---
Bingo! The sooner you start looking the better.
---
No I mean shard. 
---
Layer manipulation is a thing, and people will easily be able to manipulate which shard they are put in via grouping tactics.
---
Level 1 was for the stress test only, should be level 10 on launch
---
That game was so amazing for the first 10 levels and the pvp was so fantastic then it just got worse the higher your level
---
&gt;on a level 63 boss, your glancing blows will do 70% of normal damage  
---
Data gathered from the beta seems to indicate 65%.  
---
&gt;With 310 weapon skill (cap), you'll still glance 40% of the time, but your glancing blows will now do 100% of normal damage  
---
Data from the beta shows a cap at 95%.
---
Not directly, but you can hop from group to group to effectively pick and jump layers. I expect people will be heavily abusing this exploit during launch.
---
Hey be careful bruh, he’ll report you to Reddit admins and get your account suspended lmao. He also runs around calling people f*gs and says it’s justified while expecting sympathy for his disabilities.
---
wow that was just an amazing summation
---
Don’t let them get you down!!! Keep logging in! For Azeroth!!!
---
I can guarantee you layering will be in, long after release. They'll find some way to make it so and the only person that said otherwise was Tipsout and didn't even provide a source.
---
Seriously considering tanking now. 
---
I know there will a million warrior tanks, but I’m pretty solid at the roll, and my calendar is fairly open end of year. 
---
Would be neat to get a legendary that actually matters.
---
We are going to be sooo poor.
---
No, my idea of being immersed is that when I do things in the world, I am rewarded fairly for it. When I do content which doesn't increase my wealth/power some how, what is the point? I'd much rather do content which is relevant to my level and will help improve my character. When I am increasing my power in game, that is what I call roleplaying and immersion.
---
a fond memory I have is leveling in teldrasil and seeing all the players just running around and doing their own thing. It was wonderful to see the world so alive
---
Top wowfest was vanilla bc wotlk after that downhill
---
Even playing on a private server they are so congested right now, makes leveling extremely difficult, especially in the undead starting zone. Running into slow mob respawns, making leveling 3 or 4x slower
---
Epic :D
---
at low levels yes
---
As a constant dwarf player this thread makes me happy. I usually get along very well with Tauren players for some reason so looking forward to that again. I hope.
---
I’ll assume this is a genuine question and not a troll - the number of people playing when classic goes live will be *magnitudes* higher than OG Vanilla in 2004. Without layering, either the game is unplayable for the first few weeks (months?) because so many people are in the same area at the same time, or they lower population cap to such a level that queues are literally hours long. Please explain how either of those scenarios is preferable to (working) layering.
---
Hunters are pretty decent early on, but absolute garbage later in the game since they dont scale well, however you still want a few hunters in the roster.
---
I wonder if there was correlation intended lol.
---
Pal, I have roamed battlefields like no one. Here's the catch: you never specified which content you were taking about. Enhance shaman for dueling is utter crap. It's pretty bad ambushing people, or doing hit and runs.
---
And it is probably the strongest Warsong Gulch class/spec (would still put the 21 restau above for the instant wolf), while doing extraordinary well in AB. 
---
Outside of Disc priest and MS warrior, I don't see specs/classes really coming near in terms of usefulness. Maybe paladin because BoF, but then again, it gets dispelled by shamans. Purging two buffs with one GCD is OP in BGs.
---
Are you the paladin king?
---
Yeh no thanks.
---
Turn on the framerate cap.
---
hmm 4 years after I last paid for an a sub i got a random 7 day credit lol (last sub in 2012 and the credit in 2016).
---
Remorseless attacks. 20% bonus crit chance after kill is pretty good
---
Can you link to the phase release plans and what dungeons are in each?
---
Some say so....
---
Others say “omg get a life, you’re a literal retard, die in a hole virgin.”
---
nobody cares about the modern raid frames either lol
---
Ill be leveling night elf too to avoid the streamers
---
That's not the point, the point is that adults have relatively little time for recreational activities.
---
Which is another thing that's great about Classic. You actually have to do all the quests in all the zones. Well for the most part. There's definitely some skippable content in the world up to around 30-40 but above there you're pretty much full clearing zones.
---
....... both?
---
I remember &lt;War Front&gt;.  As good as &lt;Vicious Cycle&gt; without needing to endlessly chug consumables throughout the match. 😉
---
Hedgeheg*
---
I am, yes.
---
Awesome I'll keep an eye out! thank you :)
---
Thats alot of streamers
---
There’s a weekly thread for posts like these. Please keep them in there.
---
I recommend the one you have the most fun with. You won't have a raiding spot if you quit before 60.
---
This is my thing, why I love classic so much and why I have longed for this game to return.
---
Everything has meaning, a purpose, a sense of permanence and timelessness.
---
There are so many quirky things in this game that keep so much content relevant:
---
Want goblin jumper cables? You need Fused Wiring. How do you get Fused Wiring, you craft target dummies and loot them. Crafting target dummies requires low to mid level reagents, this keeps people farming these items, keeps the economy of these items alive, keeps the areas in which these items/veins/herbs can be found alive. These things keep the world more vibrant and alive.
---
You want Flask of Oil? Go to Wetlands, same example as earlier.
---
You want Goblin Rocket helm? You need Firebloom and Volatile Rum, level 40ish stuff, go and be in the world and contribute to how alive, breathing and vibrant it is.
---
You want resist potions for new raids or progression? Ah, but area x or y are kinda full? Go gank, assert dominance, bring the world to life. Not (yet) a good PvPer? No problem, go farm your items at a lower level area. Sure the droprate might be be worse, but you get to see a different part of the world, keep things fresh, maybe help out some lower level players with a quest. Contribute to the world, make friends. You never know, that level 42 Warlock might be the alt of a player in a big guild, and your presence and willingness to help might be repaid down the line. While the repayment is not necessary, nor should it be expected, it certainly is nice. And this is how our community grows.
---
You wanna be a good PvPer? There are HUNDREDS of consumables you can use, go out and experience the world. Maybe do some PvP while you're at it. Maybe do a few quests down in Feralas that you missed, for the feel and joy of it.
---
There are so many examples of this, that make this game what it is.
---
Everything you can do, collect, loot, craft, engage in, will always be like that. There is no "tomorrow expansion #17 comes, all your efforts are for naught".
---
Sidenote, I am an EXTREMELY strong proponent for more "vanilla" content and sideways upgrades. Make an obscure item with a fun (semi-viable) proc/stat distribution that requires a good amount of materials. Go farm these, enjoy the world, give it life. Work towards your goal, slowly but surely. Enjoy the journey.
---
AND THE HORDE ARE STRONGER FOR IT

Ahhh. I dunno. 9-10 hours work peave u 15 hours to sleep and eat and do some shit outside. It's so much fucking time you dont want to do anything.
---
So hunters will center around the tranq shot utility? Would it be better in the long run to go a warrior then because you scale really well into the content?
---
Oh they will know, concurrent log in on realms and players online will be glaring evidence
---
Alright thank you very much for all the help!
---
Adorable
---
I've never called someone a neckbeard before, but you are literally the cringiest person I've ever personally interacted with in about 25 years online.
---
It’s in the sidebar. 😉
---
the 1% miss no matter what is spell hit
---
Any set of numbers between vanilla and wrath is manageable for me. We are currently at high end wrath numbers iirc.
---
That said, I am look forward to the return of negative stats, aka hit, aka interesting itemization decisions. 
---
Further I’m looking forward to %s. Integers are so much more fun to itemize with, they great break points that are very binary. Functionally, there is no difference between being 5 rating on either side of the hit cap, you’ll notice being 1% below cap.
---
Also spirit vs mp5.
---
Vanilla is just a more interestingly itemized game.
---
Have you played the game at all in past 10 years?
---
Sorry, pretty new to Reddit :-/
---
Very true, very true. I don't mind the warrior grind because I'll be playing with friends - I'm really just concerned for a spot in a raid because I really want to try out the content.
---
Africa region?
---
Bonus roll wants a word with you.
---
Realm 6, Layer 2, Shard C
---
At the beginning I thought heirlooms sounded so bad
---
I was all the same "the journey", "leveling experience" blah blah
---
After 10-15 journeys and leveling experiences etc I just wanted to kms and Heirlooms sounded pretty good
---
But Transmog never sounded good or looked good to me
---
Nothing like seeing that full Bloodfang Rogue for the first time and knowing that guy had no life outside of WoW but you wanted to be just like him no you wanted to BE HIM
---
Do you enjoy being mediocre? play a Paladin as ret.
---
As a warrior, how does all this affect my dps as fury and my threat as prot compared to private servers?
---
Not sure what makes you think that this is the case, but it really is not.  I multibox both on my BfA accounts as well as on the classic stress test server. You do not need a VM, you can just launch multiple instances via the WoW.exe
---

Classic ignore list has a lot more slots than vanilla client did. ;)

"Your fun is wrong." Because the other 4, or 39 people aren't having as much fun because of you... Yes. There are always single player games out there for you and the OP.
---
The game doesn’t label what layer you on so not sure how you expect that to be answered by saying what layer everyone is going to be on.
---
Sorry, I dont understand your comment.
---
Same.
---
holy fuck
---
Part of the communicable experience.
---
The Forsaken are just trying to SURVIVE. You know how painful it is for them to simply *exist*? Apologize to them for judging their practical and not creative store names ***right now***. They just need to make enough to get by, man. Save the lofty sales gimmicks for the living
---
I’ve had no problems for the last 2 hours. Got to level 6 on my undead priest.
---
I know Wrath isn't super popular with people in this sub because of lfg and few other things, but it still remains my favorite time in WoW because of how well the story flowed. By the time I got to ICC, I couldn't wait to kill Arthas (may have taken many months lol but still) and I think that made the game really fun for me.
---
Good bot. Thanks for my new character name.
---
Played a total of 14 minutes and had 3 world server downs in that time frame. Time to take a nap and try in a couple hours.
---
Exactly why I haven't been on private servers in a long time, and I wouldn't touch beta. Want official Classic to be fresh for me.

Sorry, I was on mobile and couldn't grab the link easily. The sidebar of a subreddit is where all the rules, FAQs, and useful links go.
---
Here's the [Looking for Group Monday link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
---
My biggest concern with this is how it would interact with population. I feel like they'd have merge servers a lot or cross-realm in order to make sure there's enough people doing content in each expansion's content (and that could be a lot, given retail has 7 expansions).
---
Also, it'd feel weird to essentially have like 8 progression paths in retail. Might overwhelm a lot of new players with decision paralysis - and if you have guilds and 40-man raids in this alternate progression like in the current game, you'd pretty much have to commit to 1 if you want to have a community or do multiplayer content with a non-pug.
---
While a new xpac every 2 years with catch-up might be faster than necessary, I think you would have to start obseleting content eventually.
---
This is turning me on so hard right now
---
I think the orc zone is glitched. Or someone is doing something stupid
---
nearly 15 years ago, when I told my friends only WoW could kill WoW, I didn't expect this.
---
Its horizontal progression in the sense that the new instances and gear doesnt automatically invalidate the old stuff. The new sets of gear from the new raids etc may or may not be better in function, but theres a certain point you reach as you level up that the gear stops scaling up to your level.
---
You can log off in your MC gear and log back in a year and a half later, and while content patches and metas have evolved, there isnt somebody 10 levels higher than you in kara gear wrecking your face. They will still have the same 'ilvl' with newer 'set pieces'.
---
For some builds, old stuff is still BiS
---
Once you have the fps it doesn't take many minutes to fly to menethil and take the boat. Not unless you're really in a hurry to level.
---
Its the easiest thing to hop layers and abuse the shit out of it right now and you dont have to be that tryhard to do it. Doesnt matter what i think and i dont care that much, the vocal majority here and on the forums likes it anyway.
---
GW2 doesn't have gearing and power fantasy as part of iots design though. Some of WoW's biggest moments of glory for players is getting your BiS drop finally or getting together all the materials you need to finish it so you can go into content then make a big impact.
---
WoW would have to fundamentally drop the entire gearing up aspect of the game. I don't thnik they would ever consider losing the treadmill.
---
Once you have the riding skill though it's easy to get other mounts. So you can get the flashy cool exclusive class mount for cheaper and then grind AV for a white wolf or pvp rank up to get a black raptor or kodo. Or simply grind rep and get the regular ones from the factions.
---
Smooth for undeads
---
I wanted to roll the opposite faction just to get the satisfaction of getting an HK on people like asmongold
---
As long as you can see the zone and race/class, "/who" will find them.
---
The only solution would be to not stream, and we know that's not gonna happen, they would miss the juicy day 1 viewers.
---
Ooh there's an update! Restart your game and launcher. Hopefully this helps.
---
I fucking loved drustvar but I'm a huge fan of darkshire so theres that
---
Dwarf rogue or dwarf hunter are really only options anyone should ever consider.
---
I'm huge fan of hidden things/easter eggs. For example the hard to reach [goblin vendor in STV with rare recipes (video volume warning)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML4fHWnd90) (that you had to bunny hop up a tree's root to get to).
---
Anyone who plays non human Warrior is gimping themselves with that weapon skill bonus. At least with Horde you have the options of Weapon skill vs Health vs WOTF vs Bezerking (trolololol)
---
Human just shits over the other alliance races for warriors.
---
But then how will I be able to listen to Static-X while i melt faces?
---
We haven’t picked a name yet. Hope to get a RP PVP server
---
The artifacts made me super engaged in legion I loved the throw back to the talent trees, bfa is just Ugh
---
There were threads on EJ with hundreds of posts discussing the hit cap, there was never any in depth research on how it scaled with level and skill but people did notice that they never missed with 9% hit but still ocasionally missed with 8%.
---
2k dps heroes eternally

You are not alone friend. I am getting the same.

You better be careful, this subreddit will eat you up if you talk about this game in a way that doesn't outright praise it in all aspects.
---

---
Fine then.  More servers will just mean a very messy breakup by splitting a server into many parts several months into the game.  By that time the playerbase will be conditioned to layering and Blizzard will undoubtedly just keep it in the game rather than breakup guilds and friend lists by creating new realms.
---
Conjure food/water
---
So what I am seeing is dont be a nelf right now :(
---
How are Paladins and Druids for tanking dungeons while leveling?
---
Yeah, I was in a marriage like that once and it was miserable. I don’t recommend it but some people find more happiness with a partner than a game I guess. My thought is, why not have both?
---
Dam Bajheera looks like a teen in that video.  Lol
---
Greater blessing, you right.
---
Idk why people like you keep saying it is for nostalgia reasons or that it doesn't impact anything.  
---
Being able to visually see people's experience and status was massive.  Transmog and doing transmog runs had its own appeal, but it pales in comparison to the aspect of the game it helped destroy.
---
I don't think they have implemented any sort of dynamic respawn timers.  I think if they increase the spawn rates for very heavy population it might help a bit.
---
as soon as i login and start attacking a mob, world server goes down... am an orc
---
Lets imagine a job starts at 09:00 and goes till 18:00. You are done at 6, youll transfer to your home, walking to car, driving home, you arrive home at 6.30. Perhaps you pick up grociers beforehand, or get some other stuff, so itll be 7.15 then, you arrive, you perhaps shower, you prepare food, you do some random duty that has to be done, clean something, random tasks thatll get you to 8pm now. 
---
Ok youre done now, and the food is too ok, so youll sit your ass down and do something, and we consider that no social activities were planned this day. So we say you can play games till 12? You sleep till 8 then, 8 hours and you need 1hour from waking up to being at your job which is generous, taking commute into account.
---
 All in all, you have 4 hours of entertainment, and these 4 are not entirely spent playing. You check messages, read news, watch few videos, you fap which is atleast 10min. You do these random things you know which I mean cause you do them, so lets say we re at 3 hours of time spent playing. So yea, maybe makes more sense now.
---
Not that Id know anything about it tho, I do nothing but waste my time playing.
---
I hope their gaming experience is entirely ruined. Not even sarcasm. They brag about getting beta because they're 'hurr durr murr a streemurr' then you can pay the price.
---
&gt;There is no power creep, otherwise with "a 2000% increase" bosses would be dying in under 10 seconds.
---
Try to do the first raid tier of each expansion with gear from the last raid tier. Tell me if Emerald Nightmare feels easier or harder than Molten Core.

And once again, the mythical reference client has served its purpose as the shield against all complaints of inaccuracies.

hell yeah man i love duskwood too, it's a big fave

If the glancing formula is correct it means going above 308 weapon skill won't be very beneficial.

Lupos will not be valued in the current build set forth by Blizzard.  Brokentooth, owls(carrion birds are good too), and wolves (group buff) will be the pre-60 meta then wind serpents and ZG bats are also options at 60.
---
Not true. 
---
Run speed trinket from badlands is the first one you get, and you can get it pre 40
---
Carrot in a stick comes from ZF which you do mid-40s
---
&gt;  Your basically farming outlands just to get better at farming outlands.
---
This is what all power progression is ultimately. Likewise you're gearing up in BfA so that you can do BfA content easier and better than before. 
---
The only fix for the scaling powerlevels and the series of seperate "island" expansions is to drop gear asa form of power. Design new encounter new mechanics, new moves, introduce new objectives. And ultimately make a mechanically fun game.
---
Fun games have replay value by virtue of being fun to play, they don't need treadmills. MMOs just generally go for the low hanging fruit and they're scared to rock the already perilous boat.
---
And let's not forget that Silithus will be useless until AQ drops and that Winterspring has that unfinished section.
---
Grandpa bro. Get with the times. Discord is the new vent. It also serves as a forum. I can help you get set up if you need.
---
That's why every raid should bring a couple of meme specs. Anyone being out dps'd by them is underperforming.
---
I like classic a lot. I think it was probably the best 'time' to play wow and had some of the best reasons to log in and play.
---
But it has flaws. Big ones. Owning up to those is part of playing the game and being part of the community.
---
I plan to roll on a RP server. Almost guaranteed to be streamer free, ganker free, and will have custom events long into the twilight of classic after the phases are done.
---
Well maybe some items really are 1.1% or 1.9% and the text rounds up/down ;)
---
Blizzard said they might introduce a limited version of The Armory for Classic but that it probably won't be available on launch.
---
"exploit"
---
"abuse" 
---
Because Beta and stress tests are 100% accurate as to how it will work on Live... 
---
Get over it.  EQ2 had layers that you could freely switch between and people didn't cry about the sky falling.
---
2-handed arms is the way to go for leveling. You just don't have enough hit% to make Fury as efficient. Also Titans grip wasn't a thing until Wrath.
---
2h is the way to go.  You can't dual wield 2hers in classic.  There are some people who think leveling as arms is better in a pvp server
---
I'm not advocating for WoW adopting Gw2's systems, I'm just explaining it and pointing out that they're well-made. Somewhere else in this thread, I mentioned that Gw2 is the ultimate casual MMO and Classic is the best MMO. Modern WoW is the worst of botth of these games
---
Big True.
---
I dont think anyone is arguing that questing in Ashenvale as a level 40 is a good use of that players time or that content becomes irrelevant due to leveling. The specific point people usually give when talking about the longevity of content in vanilla they are talking about raids. MC is still useful to clear every week for a guild progressing in AQ40. Items like bindings for Thunderfury, enchanting recipies, never really lose value. The current system of raids in wow, makes old content obsolete very quickly.
---
I think it depends on how quick you want to get to 60 which is player to player. 
---
If you get to 60 in 2 weeks you're probably going to not wanna wait. It's not that much cheaper and it's a long ass quest. You can always go back and do the quest if you want the mount that bad, but it's objectively worse for PvP (costs mana and your regen doesn't start as soon). 
---
If you hit 60 and the phase with the quest is coming out soon then I think it's totally worth it to wait. It's a fun ass quest and it's cheaper and other mounts are always obtainable once you have the cheaper riding skill. When I hit 60 in Vanilla I rushed that quest and then got the AV wolf shortly after to have both options. 
---
TLDR; Gotta weigh the wait time vs. how much you care about the coolness of having it, but it's bad for PvP (technically).
---
This post is very misleading.  The Blue post doesn't even mention raid bosses, the test was done against level 63 elite mobs.
---
I'll be playing with 6 of my friends from high school that all played vanilla together. We've also got a friend who started playing in Cata (and pservers) that will be joining. All our group chats consist of that one friend constantly criticizing the rest of us for things we want to do. 
---
"Oh you're planning to play a druid?  Why?! You'll never be good at anything. Why are you choosing those professions? These others synergize with your class better." On and on and on about everything. 
---
Like dude, you didn't even play until 2010. We didn't min max in '05 (quite the opposite) and we don't want to now.
---
If you want to min max, that's fine, but it's all too common that those types are always seeking validation of their "superior knowledge" and "experience" by taking every opportunity to tell others why their decisions aren't optimal.
---
U lernd all this form DURID SCKOLL who has wut uh famus teecher there who is knows all this?
---
As a 55 i can run through rfc to get some greens for my alts. same with vc and stocks.
---
I'd love to see a new Classic Tier 4 raid eventually, as well as other Artifact level weapons/armor added. It would need to be hard earned though.
---
Of course people will exploit and abuse it in live. Do you seriously think everyone will just form a pact and agree to never switch layers? Come on man. EQ2 is not wow.
---
It doesn't even mention raid bosses, the test had nothing to do with raid bosses
---
Lol I see your point. But if you are saying 4 hours a day isnt a lot of time you kinda lost touch. Most people go home and watch TV till they pass out. Hours on end.
---
You can do anything you want with 4 hours everyday. That doesn't even include weekends. 
---
But it be a different story if you had like 2 kids and a wife. That shit is your hobby. Maybe once a year you get some time to yourself for a few days or a week at best.
---
I have such fond memories of that quest. Getting lost, beaten to death by mobs way higher level than me, swimming in the ocean half the way there just to avoid mobs. Such a cool adventure to take as a Shaman.
---
So 0 sources on your information and a blatant misreading of my comment.
---
Doubt they'll let us log in with name reservation characters.
---
BFA
---
2H Fury until 40 when you respec Arms to get MS.  Then continue down Fury again.
---
Stop with this negativity toward good criticism.
---
We *need* criticism of layering. In its current form it *will* be exploited and the world economy permanently raped by top guilds within weeks. 
---
So many bugs and good discussions to be had.
---
but people like you are more concerned with blindly defending Blizzard then actually improving the game.
---
This sub don’t like him, they like Omar though.
---
Interesting. I don't recall ever hearing about a melee cap higher than 8, but it has been awhile. Neat to learn about this all these years later.
---
pfUI is the best wow addon i have used. I love its quest helper, how it shows mobs ... like you want an item right? pfUi will find you it and the mobs and the drop rate of them displayed on the entire map as little dots you can hover over for a tool tip... its the best.
---
I mean i have not used ElvUi since legion But pfUI is better for questing and helping the player play. Sure not as many window options.
---
Does +5 weapon skill influence the hit cap?
---
You can do that in retail now. But you are almost certaintly better doing something else that will net more gold per hour and just buy form the AH.
---
That is my point, just because you can doesnt mean you should. Of course do whatever is fun.
---
But if the goal is to gear your alts you should probably be aiming for faming mageweave or silk @ that level if you don't have gathering professions.
---
Your concept of abuse and exploitation are flawed.  Freely being able to switch between layers to farm materials isn't going to ruin the game.  It didn't ruin EQ2's economy, it wouldn't ruin CWoW.
---
You being able to switch at leisure on a beta test server doesn't mean you will be able to switch layers freely on live.  You're just making shit up.  
---
Did you ever stop to think that Blizzard allows you to switch on the test servers because they want it to be tested?  Of course not, because then you couldn't try to panic everyone.
---
You’re right, but this is 2019, and the blizzard of today is “don’t you guys have phones”
---
2019 blizzard would rather have slightly easier server merges at the cost of player experience and ruined immersion
---
I finally took the UC zepplin from org, EK is fine, just kalimdor crashing.
---
Just curious what beta data there is against level 63 raid bosses?
---
As fury it's slightly better to dual wield while leveling IF you can get equal quality weapons. Check out some math I did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abt0kk/dual_wield_vs_2h_while_leveling_with_math/).
---
The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles
---
Yes.
---
shit youre right, I lost touch. I got way too much freetime currently inbetween what I do, so I thought 4 h is nothing, which it isnt for most people.
---
&gt;The problem with having hyper-optimized gear is that it really leaves hybrid play-styles behind in the leveling process where all classes are just looking at the 5 primaries
---
Honestly, looking at the bulk of vanilla gear, and that's how it was designed. +spell damage or +ap gear was common while leveling, but %hit, %crit, or %haste (which was pretty scarce in general) were rarely seen while leveling. Until the higher levels (40-50+), most of the gear is just primaries.
---
Lol you have clearly never experienced day 1 on a private server. It is a garbage gameplay experience. Servers constantly crashing and rolling back. Sitting in a 4k Q just to get in and have the server crash 15 mins later. Then after the main rush and the server stops shitting itself (some where around day 5) the npc spawn rates are cranked up so high its actually impossible to do some quests because the mob you just killed will respawn while you're killing the next one and then murder you. 
---
Believe me private servers don't just have this shit figgured out. They're populated only because they're literally the only option until August 27.
---
Yes but you see, in their normal betas these bugs are never fixed and just become "features". The bugs in this beta will most likely get fixed at some point. Crazy, I know!
---
No I can't. The stuff dropping there would be level 55 gear not level 15-20 gear so my alts couldn't get a benifit from it.
---
I have beta but I'm not playing for this reason
---
Yeah, its not about the game though. I'd give up video games for my wife and kids in a snap, but the fact of the matter is -- thatd be my decision. Having an SO that doesn't give a shit about your happiness is awful.
---
Never played BFA which is probably a good thing as I originally planned to after playing Legion. Im glad I didnt. Looking forward to Classic and I hope Blizzard learns something about game design from Classics reception.
---
Without wanting to come across as an asshole:
---
People really need to understand that it's a closed beta and the purpose of it is to find bugs/issues with the game, not do level 30 pvp 24/7
---
I don't mind at all if they enjoy themselves, but try not to ignore the reason why you are in the beta.
---
Well i dont count gold and ap, and thats what i get all the time gear never shows up there.
---
maybe level as hunter to reach 60 fastest and then you can play rogue and paladin as alt ?
---
rogue is fun but i hate it when it lacked AOE compared to other class
---
I've kicked so many polymorphs, roots, etc on beta at the end of the cast and get nailed every single time. Sitting 30s polys while kick is on CD is pretty annoying.
---
Not necessarily. When you have 4-5 mages, 4+ rogues, 4+ fury warriors and 3-4 warlocks, there's always going to be a couple of people from each class that are undergeared compared to the rest, and they will have worse DPS as a result. Thats the nature of gearing up all those people when raid bosses only drop a couple of pieces of loot for 40 people.
---
I can't wait to get to classic and never hear about anything post wrath ever the fuck again. I'm one of the people not afraid to say it's been trash since.
---
The system sucks in it current form.  imo the ONLY time you should switch layers would be if you joined the group of someone who is already on your friend list.  Thats it.
---
Then you missed the batch, which makes this completely the opposite of what this guy is saying.
---
People who blindly defend layering should be forced to play layered servers while the rest of us play regular servers.
---
Only when they are actually *in* a world with the 60 materials raped by layering, the biggest guilds increasing their lead, and people constantly hopping within STV, among a hundred other exploits, only then will they realize “fuck this sucks”
---
I cant make up my mind between undead priest or warlock 🤔 this just made it more difficult
---
Raid bosses are level 63, no?
---
You may have been farming the elementals for Essences? Pretty sure it's the only place to get Essence of Air.
---
All of this is subjective. I think classic is better than retail in every possible aspect. Retail is a fucking joke.
---
Once the hype dies down and you get really unbalanced server distritbutions where the only fix is to pay more money to leave (due to something out of your control) or suffer and make a new character should be all the reason you need.
---
As long as this issue is uncommon and fixed by launch I'd be fine with it. I'd rather NOT have a 25-75 faction split or a serer where everyone left to be on the topdog servers and then leave their original servers dead and empty.
---
Seriously, weigh the benefits. Would you rather have: 
---
1. long queue times
---
2. unbalanced factions
---
3. low populations
---
4. overbeaingly high populations?
---
I swear people bitching about this must never have played before sharding became a thing. There's nothing worse than watching a server die, people leave, guilds leave and major cities empty. IT's depressing and not fair to many players.
---
Thanks for the correction, I wasn't sure exactly the build Warriors use for leveling and just assumed they went full arms.
---
Sold. Downloading now lol.
---
Now I gotta go find the illegal danish...
---
I'm not really looking forward to terrible itemization and "Wolf" greens. Terrible itemization led to stupid crap like level 30 or 40 items being best in slot. The modern random enchantment system is way better.
---
The post here though has no comparison to Vanilla, so he can't really prove the batch is too big.
---
its your 31 point enhancement talent
---
Ah, good ol' Day9. I agree with most toxic people just have no better place than to vent their issues than online, and i can understand absorption being a possible solution. I just dont feel that its my job to help Jimbob with their toxic outcry. If Jimbob doesnt know how to be a proper human being on his own, i would say thats his problem. Not that i would reciprocate toxicity back towards Jimbob. We all have bad days, we all have terrible days. Knowing yourself, you should be able to resolve conflicts within. Maybe through meditation, television, music, etc. If gaming is an outlet for bad days, then making precautions that can reduce potential outcrys could be made. Thats what being a responsible person is. Muting chat. Playing a single player game. Doing mindless side quests or what not.
---
This is what I want to know. How important will it be have the +5 racial weapon skills...
---
I figured he was going for Adam Warlock.  But yours works too.
---
and laughing when people complain about high ping when its barely over 100. m8 id consider 300 to be low even lmao
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but why would the players in this video get phased at all? He saw them inside his own layer before he joined their group, therefore they are on his layer. There should be no phasing involved.
---
i dont get who you trying to target with this post .. 'oversell the game' ? who is overselling the game ? not once i saw a post here trying to oversell the game.. on the other hand the blizzard paid streamers are overselling the WOW classic because they are paid to do it as influencers on twitch (good for them as long as people dont REPOST their stream here)
---
what i am getting is the vibe that you are projecting your own insecurities about the game to other people.. Many people love WOW classic and they dont need someone to 'oversell' it to them.
---
i would consider you change your tone because this is bordering on click-baity trolling post
---
They called then "raid creatures" they dont say if there is a distinction between a creature and a boss.  The fact that they said they tested it on level +1 +2 and +3 "creatures" though tells me they likely are not raid bosses.
---
Keeping trucking along everyone!! All the crashes now mean less in the future!
---
ackshually...  
---
holy shit stop trying to eat Esfand´s ass, he never asked for it  
---
go back to redd...oh wait
---
Actually Blizzard has a decent track record of fixing major bugs in betas and in the case of BFA you end up with a ton of small annoying bugs but nothing gamebreaking.
---
This is gamebreaking for classic and rather than people understanding that this is a beta every time something happens half of the subreddit starts howling and screeching like a hyena that got hit by a car.
---
There is no feasible way to test layering without large scale stress tests like this (or inviting thousands of more players to the beta) but rather than accepting that people lose their shit.
---
I just got back from a two week vacation through deep country with people who have their stuff together I'd forgotten how awful some redditors are. You really took casual advice personally didn't you? The contrast between the stoic, friendly adventurers I was with and the whiny redditor I encountered here is vivid. 
---
Why didn't you say, "I can see where you're coming from. I'll aspire to improve my future arguments. Thanks."? That was an option, and a compelling once since your OP objectively discredits your argument. 
---
Here's more advice: loosen up a bit. You seem to go off on a defensive rant on a hairpin trigger.
---
I wasn't too excited initially but since bfa has been such a flop I'm pumped as hell
---
&gt;You being able to switch at leisure on a beta test server doesn't mean you will be able to switch layers freely on live.  You're just making shit up.
---
Source? Or are you making this shit up too?
---
The problems I see with that is that it seems like it would really spread out content for guilds to do, but that's coming from someone that's been playing with the same people since 2005.  As you fill out the BiS for your build, what incentive do you have to keep playing and clear out the new content, aside from the story/lore?  Seems like that would only capture attention for so long.
---
Any idea how much hit 5 weapon skill is equal to?
---
As a tank you'll be seeing way more parries (14% vs 5.4%) and slightly more dodges (6.5% vs 5.4%).  
---
As a fury you have a slighly lower hit cap and getting a high weapon skill won't make your glancing reduction 0% (there seems to be a cap at 5%).
---
hmmm is it possible tha 8.6% rating is from private servers?
---
It’s a joke. They did it a few times during the stress test.
---
The guy further down who commented "NO CHANGES" got a lot of hate IMO. I like this idea but from a 'just hit 60 prestige' deal. If i got to 60 and spent months progressing through the content releases, i wouldnt then reset. I would make an ult and level and then relevel it in a different area for a different experience. But i wouldnt go for anything else. Id stop playing if they created alternate content additions like OSRS did.
---
Good criticism? All he’s doing is raging and saying “they can’t even recreate their old game!” How is that constructive? If he has some sort of comment that explains WHY layering is bad? Sure, I’m all ears. If you’re literally just posting saying “fuck layering! Blizz sucks!” You’re useless.
---
You're posing a broad spectrum of gameplay contexts. It may be very situational.
---
Trying to burst? Druid
---
Mana drain sustain? Priest
---
Hi, /u/Darksynth45, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
So you're saying that blizzards current server architecture could support classic wow launch without layering. Then why do you think blizzard is trying to implement layering, just to make you and other vanilla enthusiasts mad?
---
Then wait and see like a *gasp* smart shopper!
---
You don't trust their layering system? Then don't play, wait and see. If it works out great and if it doesn't you saved your money. Same reason you don't pre-order stuff then bitch. Wait and see until it's out, right now your only arguement is basically "Sharding sucks on live and Blizz sucks in general so they can't get this right and I know it will already suck."
---
It’s more the loot style than the raids. As well as a change in mindset.
---
Personal loot allows for a lot more drops than previously. I’ve done bosses where 7 people in my raid got loot and we had ~15 people. That was before any bonus rolls too.
---
Sure Naxx raiders may do Mc still but let’s not act like they’re there for loot. People can still get upgrades from previous tiers in retail they just don’t do it cause it’s not worth the time.
---
How would they be saving money on servers if they are using more servers to provide the layers?
---
Source for what?  The fact that because the way something is on beta doesn't automatically make it that way on the final product?  Do you even know what a beta test is?
---
Balls of Steel
---
The game just had good RPG design back then, obviously there were limitations and everything wasnt perfect, but theres a reason why we all remember it fondly and we all had fun.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this still happens on release.
---
why you trying to push people in a tunnel like vision of WOW ? seem like the only way to enjoy game is your way and people shouldnt waste time doing WHAT they like and instead to things YOUR way ?
---
i find this ignorant given that many people love doing silly things in classic vanilla WOW and dont care about high end raiders or vice versa
---
There isn't but the blue posts says the formulas are the same on all levels. Data is here: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5
---
Nice
---
Also fwiw, I've kicked this warlock, Bigpimpins, pet after I get seduced to interrupt the seduce at least twice a WSG the past couple days. It doesn't "feel" right, but who knows.
---
when reviving at a spirit healer, the background of my character's portrait changed from black to light blue.
---
We're three months away from launch, they have time to fixthese technical issues. This isn't like a shit-from-the-ground-up game design issue like Azerite armor. It\s a tech issue that's being worked out, among MANY other bugs. That's what the beta's for.
---
Yep keep stressing the server. It’s our entire purpose right now. Means less when it’s live.
---
They have gear that has new set bonuses and players wear different combinations  of sets so as time goes on you have more set combinations which interacts differently with new skills added and skills being buffed/nerfed/changed over time
---
Replayability is a factor in games. All of those zones and dungeons could be experienced fresh on a different character. That has value.
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Be real you don’t really need to farm gear for alts on a main in retail. Not cause the content is irrelevant either it’s just the style of the game now. It’s a loot piñata action game now.
---
If bugs get ironed out and it is implemented how they say it will be, it has *no downside*. None.
---
If you want servers to open up with 5k+ people all in starting zones with no phasing or layering... then you just don't know what you're talking about. I've been there for the 5k+ launches... it's awful.
---
"Players have an 8% chance to miss a creature that is 3 levels above them in our Reference client. This holds true for our Classic client as well."
---
All raid bosses are calculated as level 63, therefore 3 levels above players.
---
Then you move to super crits, a tier of crits above regular crits, and you need to be at 100% to even start getting super crits. /s
---
You won't be disappointed, you will be characters you know starting right at the tutorial
---
They say that if you play a Paladin you can start attacking a mob, and go do some chores and make it back in time to loot the corpse.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Even if this does work why would you want to play like this?
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user CarrieMH687 once said:
---
&gt; Why do you waste your time doing this
---
*I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
---
dam, I want winxp back
---
on the bright side, travel form with pvp bonus is as fast as a slow mount with carrot.
---
Ugh. I don't want to be known as a hunter. Item greed mostly. But aspect of the cheetah and a pet would make leveling faster. Plus, I don't really care for hunters. I'm only having issues because my most played classes are the three that were added in expansions. (DK, Monk and DH) Well, and Enhance shaman, but modern enhance is so different from vanilla enhance that it's not really comparable.
---
Why drop tailoring if you're not going to pick anything else up? Do you have a recomendation for the free slot or is that where you just do w/e you want personally?
---
I'd keep tailoring and farm mats for mooncloth bags for gold or alts. Or play the AH for cheap felcloth days. 
---
Also this is clearly a strategy for rushing to 60 as fast as possible. I think you can skip skinning and just start with mining and ench from the start to simplify this and not have to double back on leveling up mining. Not a criticism, just pointing it out for anyone who doesn't want to restart mining while still keeping 99% of the benefit of this route.
---
Ah, maybe that is a better place to define as where it started. It was definitely middle of wrath in any case. 
---
I was just thinking how easy the transition to Ulduar from Naxx was compared to going to MH or BT from SSC and Loot Reaver in BC
---
what is P servers ?
---
Yeah do you have a source that things in the beta are different from how they will end up on live?
---
You act like there will only be one server...
---
P as in Private
---
2 points is typical in imp frostbolt, or 3 if you are spicy. So lets say 3 (which you shouldn't have until level 14 anyway, so my original example still stands). Another example:
---
At level 18 you can choose to rank fireball (4) or keep using frostbolt (3)
---
Frostbolt (3) with 3 points in imp frostbolt has a dpm of 1.08 and a dps of 28.7. Without the talents the dps is 24.77.
---
Fireball (4) with no talents has a dpm of  1.18 and a dps of 37.5.
---
I think most people just dont make good use of thier time. And sort of in denial about how they feel. Lots blame work for stealing thier time. And it's understandable. Work sucks and they treat you like an expense instead of an asset.
---
I think if you are in that situation there is no amount of time away from work that could possibly be enough. Let alone depression and society's setup to be alone to deal with your own feelings. Then people start to have mid life crisis and question everything about thier lives. If you make it through that then you get health problems lol. Not having enough time is an illusion, but I can understand why people feel that way. They are tired as fuck from life.
---
Nothing's perfect. Life is bullshit sometimes. I just had some shit happen to me that will chnage me forever. And in those 4 weeks I have been grieving my partner life was on fucking hold. And it's still bullshit that shes dead. But I have no choice but to use these next months to continue my life as before without her.
---
I honestly have no idea what I'm trying to say anymore lol
---
word I appreciate the response
---
305 weapon skill gives around 2.9% hit but I'll have to find my source on that later I am stuck at work.
---
Its all about Getting out of the lvl 1-5 zone as the spawn rate is too low for the amount of people
---
AFAIK multiboxing is entirely fine and permitted, but duplicating inputs to multiple characters is not. So you couldn't have your toons stand on top of each other, then move them both with WASD simultaneously.
---
Layering will be exploited by top guilds, effectively increasing their lead
---
It will be exploited by resource farmers
---
Aoe farmers will exploit it
---
The above will result in ruined economy
---
Layering anywhere longer than 2 weeks will have these effects
---
And you’ve seen videos about how all this works
---
Do you need more details?
---
Teeb the druid?
---
whats with the near constant disinfo / fake news regarding  Sharding ? it is like someone is trying to make the 'shard' feature something bad
---
You are asking me if they've changed anything at all on beta?  Really?  I mean, there's a bug list you can go read.  Do you expect all of those to make it to live?
---
My main worry with this is that it splits the player base and hastens the death of the true classic servers.
---
And the probable INT will help you level the dang Staff weapon skill.  Win/win rofl
---
Honestly the thing I'm most excited about coming back to wow is making macros again.
---
Is staff of westfall better to get for warrior than those mail pants?
---
Man these fucking DC's are making me crazy. 
---
Reading the comments I now realize its the NE starting area. Guess at least im helping the cause with the test.
---
During the asmon lvl 1 raid pvp. 6 undead were there to hold the line at all costs. https://gfycat.com/FearlessComfortableHind
---
We now know the true meaning of "stress test"
---
I know I'm just saying that the comparison can't be made becasue they're so inherently different. WoW would've had to start off entirely different.
---
Say it louder for the people in the back.
---
No worries. That's pretty damn significant though if that's the case. Humans using swords for example get a free 3% hit, that's just nuts and let's you itemize to other stats better.
---
Every server is going to have a Human Warrior named Asmongold, they could very feasibly do it by hiding enough key information. Worst case scenario he does a face cam only stream. 
---
Everyone is going to be in the Elwynn Forest. He literally just needs to make it ahead of the pack. Don't be so thick.
---
are you unhappy?
---
Unless we can convince Blizzard to remove layering, it's likely going to work the same way on launch day.
---
Confirm, been playing a few hours on forsaken, no issues
---
The elites are still there and arrows.
---
It's gunna happen
---
If his name was Cold Steel, then he is an Edgehog.
---
It's an additional 5\*0,04% so 0,2% for YELLOW HITS.
---
I think I’d rather go roll on a fresh private server than play classic with what is obviously just sharding / phasing. I’m not blind.
---
&gt; Carrot on a stick was useful for everyone and made a ~~big~~ difference while levelling.
---
i hope this subreddit didnt devolve into streamer's advertisement subreddit
---
I explicitly stated I haven’t seen confirmation on number of servers but speculation is that it would be less than vanilla launch which was 40. More players, less servers... not difficult math here, man.
---
Is this in relation at all to how streamers are able to tank mobs 20+ levels higher than them, survive and even kill them with big enough groups? I don't remember classic being this easy.
---
Questing in Loch  Modan for the first time, on my gnome warrior.  No particular event or memory, it’s just my favorite zone.
---
I loved these ads, I thought I was so cool for playing wow back then.
---
I would imagine that's probably to do with rounding.
---
If your real hit % is something odd like 7.996% or something it may round up to display to 8% but given the large sample size of many many swings on a boss, the slight chance to miss that's actually there could happen.
---
That's just conjecture on my part but it's the first thing that comes to mind. Might also judt be a bug in Vanilla/Classic and its been lived with.
---
Thats literally itemization...
---
When I don’t use a /s I get ripped a new one by idiots with low reading comprehension.
---
It’s .04% hit. Weapon skill is inverse of defense. 5 skill is .2% hit.
---
Druid. Probably not full resto but either moonglow or HOTW
---
Not only were trinkets rare, but the first ones you get were weird shit like "slow down an enemies attack speed by 20% for 10 seconds (4 minute cooldown" so a mount speed trinket was clearly better, since movement speed is the one stat that's always good in games
---
Sorry I don’t think losing is fun. If that’s fun to you go ahead. 
---
But I’m sure you’d also deny someone from your group if they were a paladin in all cloth gear because it looks good and matches.
---
I think it's going to be pretty unanimous
---
I would definitely prefer dynamic spawns to any form of layering.
---
Where's the option for "Rather have this question stop being asked 35 times per day?"
---
Im honestly torn between maining a Priest, Mage or a Warlock right now. I very well might level all three. So excited.
---
You get crit chance from agility, no?
---
So the values changed a lot through vanilla.
---
Is 1.12 easier or harder than earlier versions with the supposed old values ?
---
And also since your screenshot of a miss with 8% is from AQ, I guess this means it was only changed in very late patches after AQ, either 1.11 or 1.12.
---
I've played for a lot of it but never really stuck around or got heavy into raiding. Mostly did Arena and such but stopped playing a lot and really just followed the story since Legion.
---
I just doubt that this reference client even exists.  The fact that every single inaccuracy that has been brought up has been "verified as correct" by the reference client just seems very convenient.
---
taken from Turinpt's post below, (read that for why they believe its accurate)  
---
 **Glancing blows and +weapon skill**  
---
With 300 weapon skill (base) and swinging on a level 63 boss, your glancing blows will do 70% of normal damage. With 310 weapon skill (cap), you'll still glance 40% of the time, but your glancing blows will now do 100% of normal damage. Having above 310 weapon skill will not make your glancing blows do more damage. Every point of weapon skill you have above 310 is instead worth 0.04% crit and 0.04% hit. But no matter how much weapon skill you've got, you'll always have a 40% chance to land a glancing blow on your white swings. And your glancing blows will never crit.
---
You're an idiot and wrong
---
I was a complete noob in vanilla, but I was treated well so Im gonna treat everyone else well too. Hopefully being positive will spread amongst people and there will be less toxicity.
---
Which sub shard though
---
But it being bad is just your opinion.  You also have no proof that the way it works now isn't just for the sake of testing.  I don't care if it is or isn't.  I simply don't care about layering in the slightest.
---
Right, not accepting the flaws isn't appreciating something for 100% of what it was.
---
Streamers are already burned out. You can see it in their faces. They making too much money to not stream it though.
---
Just read this to my wife, lol.
---
It can be the difference between 150dps and 300dps in MC. At least on Pservers I would out DPS some equally geared or better geared hunters cause they didn't use rotations properly.
---
I always pick the staff.  Spirit is legit strong as fuck on a warrior while leveling.  Decreases down time to next to nothing if you enough of it.
---
If you don't like pointless memes and polls, you're in the wrong sub.  Real discussion is not welcome here.
---
I'm curious to how they are even having THIS type of bug in the first place
---
Also the option for "There's no reason they can't do both on different servers."
---
After a long time actually got a loading screen and got thrown back to Tirisfal Glades on the Graveyard
---
Yeah I’ve thought for years they need to lower the number of difficulties in retail. 
---
Leaving aside that obviously LFR needs to go, I’ve always liked Preach’s suggestion that there just be Normal (somewhere between Normal and Heroic now) and Mythic using the Ulduar model of being able to choose your difficulty per boss. 
---
If we absolutely have to keep LFR for some stupid reason, I also like Preach’s suggestion that it be an expansion or at least a tier behind (and not offer gear upgrades at all) so that sure there’s a tourist mode available, but if you want to see the content in a timely manner you need to find a group/guild.
---
Yeh it is relevent, when I want to go back and solo it just to feel good :)
---
$13-15 if ppl can't afford that atleast cmon.....
---
dont let activision blizzard design any new content for our beloved game.
---
we've come this far, don't throw it away now.
---
I got the same issue exactly! Might be going with hunter but I will miss healing :(
---
Realm 4, layer2.5 , shard Alpha
---
Funny, I see a lot of that going on about the game regardless of OPs post.
---
People are downvoting because the OP is titling the post in a condescending way, as to say that people think this version of layering is fine. Which no one agrees with.
---
There is no wrong spec.  You play you.  Be the dream.
---
Yes unless you get smites mighty hammer. You can make an argument for pants if you get the quest mace from redridge in any scenario you will exchange the staff for arceus the morladim quest in darkshier.
---
Very but not for the hit. It’s the glancing blow damage reduction penalty. Weapon skill is the inverse of defense. 1 weapon skill is .04% chance to hit. It does however increase the damage of your glancing blows which are ~40% of your white attacks against bosses.
---
Because you're human scum.
---
I didn't read that but warlocks are cool
---
This sub has a large mass of idiots.

Imagine anyone else writing that comment.
---
There should be an option redo TBC without flying lmao
---
It's even in their class description.
---
Source on the fact that blizzard is working on the side effects layering will have on the meta of the game, they still havent communicated the concerns some people have.  Yes its a beta but you dismissed the guy above on the pretext that it is just a testing environment and that everything will work out in the end. Thats not how betas work, not everything gets fixed if it doesnt have enough attention.
---
UbiGeofram's answer is great. I'm a bit more casual so here's what I'm going to do. 
---
Mining and Tailoring from the get go. Do my best to level them as I level but I'll probably not keep up and have to farm at 60 to finish them up. 
---
Once I have the mining mats for engineering I'm going to drop it and pick up engineering and level it by purchasing all the other mats I need (UbiGeofram's plan gets them a lot of these mats I'll have to buy). 
---
Once I can create Robe of the Void I'll keep tailoring to just farm mats for good selling items when I want some gold. Probably mostly Mooncloth Bags for gold and to make for my alts. Engineering is obviously for the utility items in PvP and whatnot.
---
Changing his tone so their opinion suits you more? I don't know, I think they make a valid point. This subreddit has a way of turning a blind eye to things they don't want to remember from classic, or just don't remember in general, and it's not a bad thing it's just how people want to remember things. I think it's completely fine to remember the game how you want but it's also fine to step back and notice the game for its flaws, too.
---
I was torn because I was concerned about how it would impact Blizzards approach with retail, Im still concerned about that. I think I also forgot about the positive elements of the Vanilla and only remembered the bad things, but listening to other people has made me remember why I enjoyed Vanilla. I think in terms of game design its far better than retail and I think the game should adopt elements of classic.
---
Nope, just keep posting quality criticisms, and stop promoting and upvoting posts like I responded to saying “layering sucks, blizz is fucking up”. Trust me, I don’t want it to last more than a month, and fully understand both the downsides and upsides. Hopefully blizz does not keep it for the entirety of phase one, and actively monitors when it should be removed.
---
You still haven't proven that anything even needs to be fixed.  You getting sad that someone else switched layers and got an iron ore node doesn't make it broken and bad.
---
This is the best argument for why old WoW was better in my opinion. Everything just felt more valuable. I hate that gear now just feels like random items with preferred stats slapped on them.
---
TBC was really fun. There were a few things I didn’t like but it added some nice things too.
---
Enemies can dodge from behind right?
---
No, it is not fine on a private server with 6k pop where getting to level 5 takes 3 times longer because you stand in line to do basic quests. Temporary layering is the right call
---
Mats on the auction house are going to be expensive as fuck. You're trying to limit the damage from having to level crafting professions at all.
---
But yes, the goal is to limit how much time you spend not leveling until you hit 60. In just ore alone, for 300 engineering you need:
---
* 166 Copper Ore
---
* 100 Tin Ore
---
* 10 Silver Ore
---
* 4 Iron Ore
---
* 176 Mithril Ore
---
* 195 Thorium Ore
---
It's unrealistic to grab those while leveling unless you plan to stop leveling. You drop mining when you start entering zones you can't mine in and pick up enchanting because it's free mats to sell from quest items you wouldn't use otherwise (usually you want to vendor weapons though).
---
Since you're going to have to mine all these nodes anyway, picking up mining again is not a big deal.
---
And yes, there's some money to be made with Tailoring, but it won't match the money made with any of the gathering professions. I'd argue that Warlocks shouldn't even go Tailoring because the robe that drops off 4 MC bosses is better.
---
I was planning arms all the way down. Why is it better for the fury first? Will being on a PvP server affect the choice or is the fury generation from fury tree just better?
---
So you extrapolated a ton and written a wall of text but you are saying the same thing. Good job I guess?
---
There is nothing about gold that makes WOW imbalanced and if you disagree that’s your opinion, but I definitely don’t agree with the majority of what you’ve written.
---
You’re trying to apply macro economics to Classic WOW and it doesn’t make sense.
---
Nah, gnome, which used to be packed for that kind of events. But then again I was in Teldrassil shortly afterward to test my dunmorgoh teldrassil route. Havent' really experienced teldrassil though,  dced immediatly after
---
I’m hoping you are where I end up. My wife doesn’t game but has agreed to try it. Here’s to hoping. I already know my daughter will want to play, cause anytime I go afk she hops on and plays anyways. Can even boot up the game herself.
---
Going to finally get a 144hz monitor so I can play wow at Fucking max settings of 2005 and Fucking spoke FPS through the roof lol.
---
I agree. I loved knowing certain zones were off limits and generally known to be end game zones. It gives you something to look forward to and has that allure. You’re still given options in vanilla as well as to where you can quest in a given level bracket which is great.
---
Just give me my rp-pvp server blizzard.
---
There are literally a hundred greater problems in retail than basic tutorial systems that exist in every modern game that are mostly aimed at people who have never played PC games (yes, they do exist).
---
That stuff has been in WoW for a long ass time anyway just without the shoehorned UI graphics. Remember the training dummy and annoying tutorial box with every action? That stuff has been around for over a decade.
---
I strongly disagree.
---
Mangle was super broken in 2.0.   It made feral brainless because there was little reason to use shred (backstab) over spamming mangle.  Rake was never "worth it" for damage, it barely did any damage with or without Mangle.  Rake was worth using on plate because it was the cheapest energy/combo point (pounce, rake, rip, go into bear on warriors), but Mangle didn't make Rake somehow "worth it".
---
Also, IS swam didn't exist for 85% of Vanilla and the cookie-cutter feral build doesn't take it.
---
Just generally, I think you're way wrong.  Vanilla feral was much more interesting than TBC feral, which just played like a shitty rogue.  Anyway, the most fun Druid build in Vanilla for PvP was feral charge/IS/balance.
---
why is there such a mechanic in the first place? is that some old 14 years old restriction the game had to have back then?
---
Parry chance against bosses 14% instead of 5,6% on pservers. This will reduce TPS significantly!
---
This will equate to more tank dmg with increased occurrence of boss parry hasting right?
---
I keep saying this, but you could easily itemize an extra raid tier or maybe two by just adding sidegrades and sets for specs that suffer from poor itemization. The item power wouldn't even have to be high.
---
If Naxx and its insanely optimized items (by vanilla standards) didn't exist, you could do even more.
---
So much this. It really can't be overstated how much of that crucial community aspect was forever lost when cross realms and LFD were added, it was near the end of WOTLK when the three pre ICC dungeons were released I believe.
---
I personally really like the concept, I just don't like ESO gameplay that much...
---
True. Still not sure why I'm here every day (hour if I was honest.)
---
Why are we here?
---
Great post, but one problem,  you are playing a Gnome :P
---
A good ide is to check quest rewards in advance and plan your questing route to take advantage of quest dropping weapons a perfect example is the 2 hander mace that dropp from vagash quest in dunmorgor you only need 2 ppl for the quest there are no prerequisites and the mace is God until level 14-15 when you get troggslicer from lochmodan
---
What? This is most likely a bug?...in a beta? I can't stand some of the people in this sub. If this shit makes it to live..then yes be pissed. But getting mad now during a beta testing phase just seems so useless.
---
I'd play any of them then, I'd personally go warrior as horde just to tank 5 mans. There will be a large demand for them. Many people think there will be a lot of them but I don't think a good portion that start leveling one will make it all the way to 60.
---
Yes. Dodges are always possible.
---
I didn't post that. That comes from a private server guide so I wouldn't trust it.  
---
The blue post said nothing about how it scales with weapon skill so more testing is required.
---
Honestly, LFR hurt raiding bad for me. 
---
Busting your ass and getting your guild through a raid made each new area you see after first downing a boss really fun. 
---
But LFR takes all that mystery away. 
---
Sure classic will have raids I’ve seen before but I get to see them from the bottom again as opposed to just getting to blast through it as current content filler before I can get into a raid to do what I already dude that week.
---
Doesn't the layering thing that people are also worried about combat this?
---
If think you have bigger relationship problems than can be solved on Reddit when you need permission to have a hobby that takes you 4-5 hours a week.
---
My wife and me both have hobbies and friends that we interact with without the other.  It’s perfectly normal.  We don’t ask each other’s permission or would ever feel the need to get it.
---
You basically want every raid to be inspired from Ulduar ?
---
Im in bro Ulduar is the best raid ever.
---
You realize that people play games while watching streams all the time right?
---
SHUT UP NERD GO AWAY
---
Is it august yet?
---
I can’t wait either. I was just talking to my buddy on how I can’t get into it cause it essentially caters to you until you get towards end game. I wanna actually experience all of classic since I originally played it when I was like 9.
---
Druid
---
And to repair.
---
uh no, you can be in denial all you want but its no secret diablo 3 is legit dead.
---
Didn't a patch earlier than 1.12 introduce normalized weapon speeds? Does this mean weapon speed isn't essential, or are there breakpoints we should be aware of?
---
I was Alliance back in Vanilla-Wrath, so I'd prefer going Alliance for nostalgia's sake, but if this build isn't feasible, I'll probably go Horde just to avoid WotF and see the Horde questlines.
---
This a very unintentionally apt thing for a warrior to say.
---
"Alright brainiac all that math is great and all but how does this affect my MUSCLES?"
---
Fuckin LOL if you paid 50 bucks to play the demo. You got got. 
---
Then inviting streamers who attract TONS of attention to their game? Sounds like a good business tactic and it has clearly worked. Just look at this subreddit. 
---
Now onto the meet and taters. I agree with you. I do not want layering beyond the first month. People will start to take advantage. But I also don’t want to spend an insane amount of time getting out of beginning areas as time is much tighter now than 15 years ago. Keep the criticism going, but make it constructive. Outline what needs changing. Suggest alternatives. But don’t just rage and go REEEEEE. Be like....reee they should really limit the time of layering based off people’s progression and actively monitor how economies are being affected.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing but for a different reason.
---
I was a healer for vanilla/TBC and all I remember from any of those bosses was staring at raid frames the whole time.
---
Going mage this time around. I'm going to enjoy the scenery and only worry about my one button rotation this time around.
---
Soul fire is a 1 minute cd but do u
---
Agreed completely
---
Search for 'diff' on /r/classicwow/ and worry less.
---
I've never heard anyone say anything similar to what you say they do in this post, obviously a level 15 dungeon isn't going to be relevant to anyone above that, nobody would disagree, what they are referring to is engame content and how none of it becomes irrelevant, which outside of a guild with full naxx gear is generally true, guilds will constantly run the lower raids like MC and ZG because they offer very powerful items or enchants that are relevant for the entire game.
---
They say this because in retail older raid tiers truly do become irrelevant, in BFA there is no reason to go do uldir outside of transmog or achieves which are purely vanity.
---
There is a post on the front page of this sub reddit that is my statement but as a positive.
---
It's laughable that you're pointing out a fact and your comment is deemed controversial by this subreddit. I will be just as pissed as everyone else if this is the state of layering when the game goes live but being pissed off about it now is a waste of time. Report it and hope they get it fixed.
---
I would go rogue over pally. Rogue was my first 60 and one of my most memorable. Honestly a blast!
---
But then that isn't the classic wow experience. To stay true to OG they have to enable addons and if you aren't hardcore enough where you need to use them to keep up,then why do you care if someone has a slight advantage?
---
I dunno. I consider being called Tipsout a pretty hardcore insult honestly. Him, Staysafe and Esfand all feel like wannabe "vanilla" hardcore when between them they have very little non-private server experience. Tipsout especially is a complete meme. Reporting Verdan and dying constantly in WC.
---
&gt; Most obnoxiously though is the hand holding. Gigantic tool tips you can’t get rid of. PRESS M TO SEE YOUR MAP. PRESS C TO LOOK AT YOUR GEAR. Across your screen in giant letters. A square above your skills that says Controls that just shows you WSAD, the space bar, and the 1-4 buttons. 
---
That’s not hand holding. That’s just what essentially is having the manual in game. Was the manual that shipped with the game hand holding? That shit is gone after the start and 0 effect on the gameplay.
---
Hand holding is arrows to quest locations, and other such things that are constantly affecting gameplay and are always there telling you exactly where to go and what to do in order to finish your quests.
---
You chose one of the worst “hills to die on” so to speak. Retail has a lot of hand holding problems. Basic control tutorial is not one of them.
---
Addons existed in vanilla
---
You can have as many chars at any time. You can also use programs hitting the same keys. What you cant do is have keys automated(pressing 1 button makes you hit x and y for example) or timed (hit 1 then it automates pressing 1 again in 2 seconds).
---
The only thing you cant do is do it in bgs and such as follow does not work.
---
It's really good because it still reduces the glancing blow damage penalty from 30% penalty to 5% penalty.  Also 5 weapon skill is .2% hit and crit as well which is not negligible.
---
Got a spreadsheet already setup for dickheads and why be good dudes and why.
---
For PVE. You won't find any human in Apes, and there's a good reason for it.
---
Uhh. Vanilla had castbar mods so idk what you're talking about?
---
Another misinformed Op, what a surprise.
---
I played on Arthas. After a guildie got Sulfuras I was on his r14 grind team as the flag carry druid. What guild were you in?
---
they provided screenshots of it, but its good to be skeptical
---
Raid bosses are lvl 63, nothing special about them. The same is true for them what is true for lvl 33 enemies to a lvl 30 player character.
---
One streamer controlling most of a server's playerbase sounds a bit far fetched.
---
That means that the only reason people were playing was because of that streamer.  That the streamer meant more to them than the game itself.  Also that a large percentage of the people on the server were only there because of those reasons...
---
Beautiful
---
No.
---
Agree to disagree, I suppose.
---
They were always this easy, but most people were noobs and playing with noobs so it seemed harder.
---
No. Won’t happen.
---
So what do we do after Naxx with the heavily inflated stats raiders have from tier 3? Hell imagine the stats players would have if we got a fourth tier.
---
_Cap me daddy_
---
Lol waitttt he reported verden!? Why hahah
---
Quality banter.
---
Weapon speed correlates with warriors instant abilities like overpower, cleave, and mortal strike which all use melee weapon in calculate damage. Thus a slower weapon results in more overall damage done. 
---
You’re right about rage gen tho, weapons are all normalized in that regard.
---
There has been no evidence of any inacuracy yet other than the stoneskin totem bug...
---
What are the pros/cons of rolling a pve server vs pvp server?
---
they didn't have accurate ones though, op has a point
---
Or it means that Blizz worked diligently the last months and most of the basic stuff is already working correctly.
---
Where would the azshara CTF take place? I thought the whole zone was available for our exploration.
---
I believe it was because going from 8-9% +hit was not worth losing most other stats for.
---
yup thanks bro, think I'd pick hunter
---
The 8% cap formula that's used on some private servers is:
---
D = Target Defense - Weapon Skill  
---
If D &gt; 10 --&gt; 7% + (D-10)\*0.2%  
---
Else --&gt; 5% + D\*0.1%  
---
But I wouldn't trust it. We need to do some extensive testing on retail to figure out the real formula.
---
we had these in vanilla my dude
---
That's probably 50% of the reason why some ally players play gnome. The other 50% being escape artist.
---
op doesnt have a point, i had 50+ addons in vanilla, some of which were actually far more powerful than today's addons, due to how lax they were with API use, ie healbots
---
Yeah understatement.  Parry on raid bosses is huge because it also means the next attack comes 50% faster.  
---
This means not only way way less threat, but significantly more damage taken by the tank.
---
huh?
---
Sure they did, accurate to within tenths of a second... Latency affects cast bar timer accuracy btw.
---
“Casualizing” and creating separate difficulties killed raiding. I loved 40 mans because it truly made you feel insignificant. You weren’t even close to being the hero you are today.
---
People also kept running MC because Rag drops T2 pants.
---
I would absolutely be on board with a new game entirely. I hope that’s what they’re doing. If Classic is a big success, I’m betting the next expansion after BFA will be a big flop. I know I won’t be buying it. And then making a new game (based on the same lore universe, obviously) will be the best business decision for Blizzard too.
---
Eh?  This also showed that the private server boss parry and dodge rates were wrong and on 1.12 bosses will be significantly harder for that reason.
---
Also, this info they confirmed makes bosses stronger against melee dps than on pservers because they have a higher dodge chance, 6.4% instead of 5.4%...
---
This shows that bosses will be significantly harder than private servers.
---
Going to make a really long story and a joke a lot shorter.
---
Because of your comment I found out head (p.e.) is still around and has a new album coming out.
---
Exactly
---
Easy, all you gotta do is push it and give it the only thing.
---
They alraeey showed a screenshot of it and I doubt they're using a private server lmao
---
I think I also farmed the humanoid cultists for something as well.
---
But yeah I think I was getting airs down near where you got thudnerfury BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER
---
Nelf is the worst race by far for warriors, human is the pve spec and gnome is the pvp spec, dwarf is also viable but stoneform is generally gonna do less for you than escape artist considering getting slowed and kited is pretty much warriors biggest weakness.
---
I don't know why I got a downvote... I was just seeing if you grouped with a gnome warlock named Lockstar. We had a few in the group.
---
Mage probably. You even wear 2 Blue-PvP Setpieces as Mage for PvE till AQ/Naxx Upgrade.
---
You mean like Classic wouldn’t happen?
---
The only thing an addon couldn't tell was what rank of spell you were using and if you had any talents that increased cast speed. The good ones "learned" if the target had the talents though after the first cast.
---
What's a better way blizz could have handled it? You seem very educated on the subject.
---
Do you remember that patch cross realm was released in? I don't remember cross realm in vanilla.
---
The problem is these things don’t go away. It’s so distracting, and are still there after an hour. How long do I need have a big box show up on my screen pointing onto my map that has a distracting bouncing arrow telling me that the question mark laid down exactly where I need to is what I need to be paying attention? Also I did mention the fact that every quest seems to tell you exactly where to go and what to do. I shouldn’t be 7 levels into the game and still get “right click to loot a monster” after my 12th “kill x to get x” quest. It’s pretty bad.
---
Really been enjoying Asmongold’s streams
---
Wat
---
Bring in the downvote hate, but it's probably perfect and Blizzard did a fantastic job of implementing it exactly as it was in Classic.
---
Unfortunately, for all the people who forgot.  Spell batching really sucks.  Sure, two Mages can sheep each other and how funny is that.  But, then your tank dies even though you healed him because fatal damage came through on the same batch during your 20th freaking BWL attempt and now one of your long time guild mates is done with "this shit game" forever. Or you kill a Grounding Totem with a swing of your staff and then it, from the grave, grounds your POM Pyro because it all happened in the same batch.  Or, your 1 hour LOH is on cooldown but your friend died anyway, then a moment later you also died and your bubble was put on cooldown too.
---
Spell batching is still in retail, it's just not massive.  Increasing batches by a small amount from retail would be alright so Rogues can gouge Blinks or whatever.  But that's a slippery slope and not vanilla so here we have vanilla batching.
---
This huge amount of old school attack leeway and spell batching are going to constantly piss everyone off.  Especially the most important people, the casuals, who aren't even going to know what forces are at play, but they do know they keep getting fucked over.
---
Warts and all, here you go.
---
&gt;as there isn't another expansion
---
They've talked about the possibility of adding BC. I just hope that if they do, it's on a different server.
---
If you were farming cultists it was probably after the AQ patch. They didn't have worthwhile loot tables until then. I can't even correctly remember if there were cultists in the zone until AQ patch.
---
Got proof that it's easy to abuse right now?
---
I'll argue that Ulduar's hard modes are still "one raid". There's no drop-down menu where you choose Heroic or Normal. It's just one raid, and the fights happen to have pre-encounter mechanics
---
So any dps "gain" over pservers only requiring 8% hit is more than negated by the higher boss Dodge chance, right?
---
Yes it's the way the game was designed originally to reduce server load. As a by product the whole pvp meta was shaped by it so now it's apart of the Vanilla identity, changing it to a faster updating server is easily done nowadays but it would be a big change to vanilla meta/balance.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually
---
You actually interested? Or are you just content with being a condescending prick?
---
what do you mean wat? We are lvl 10 in the stress test realm, queued a BG and got placed against people from the Beta. They were lvl 19.
---
Oof. World server down
---
Imp is level 4
---
no u
---
lol how does this even happen? B E T A
---
Pretty much. They went through the trouble of recreating it for the true vanilla experience.
---
Well Hard Modes and Heroics/Mythic are 100% different.
---
It's okay if you didn't play classic, dude.
---
Something with heals
---
They did and at the time they said it it wasn’t going happen. Meetings happen, years pass, technology changes, they can change their mind and they did. But they wont add new content to a game that’s already been released. People have been playing private servers for years of just vanilla and are happy with that. They won’t ruin classic by adding in content that was never there.
---
Layering is fucking terrible and if it launches like that it will be horrible. They just should abandon that garbage and open up a bunch of Servers with 5K pop limit and later merge them together when the Casualscrubs quit.
---
I read that post as he's talking about how classic is it's own closed ecosystem, with no expansions, everything is classic is part of it's own game, with nothing else to skip to, much like how other games have parts of it that eventually become too low for where you are, but still make sense in the entire design of the game.
---
In the later expansions everything prior becomes actually irrelevant and left behind, which is true, in TBC we left for Outland and azeroth suddenly didn't have much to do for endgame players outside of Kara, same with wrath, and pretty much every expansion after, with cata I guess being the exception as it revamped the world.
---
yeah, we still somehow managed to cap 2 times. looooool
---
Condescending prick. Because its painfully obvious that you have no clue what you're talking about. Feel free to prove me wrong though.
---
yeah i'd be down for that but so many others would just scream "NO CHANGES" :/
---
It hasn't been "up" for more than a few minutes at a time for hours.
---
Exactly! Someone above said there was a blue post about layering being bugged and they're working on fixing it.
---
I was a part of the EJ threads back in the day. Most everyone ran 9% by the time naxx rolled around because it cost just about nothing to do so.
---
I was doing it in bwl for days gathering purposes and loved it. Vael was stupid fun for rogues though.
---
Haha yeah, 2 hours...*aggros a Magma Hound accidently*
---
Yea, classic was perfect it has no flaws whatsoever, and every expansion after it was just terrible and didn't improve upon anything!
---
I know this isn't combat related so might not be interesting to some people, but at one point I controlled 1/5 of my server's entire auction house activity due to addons.  This was on live WoW, not a private server.
---
Edit to add:  When they started cracking down on this it hurt that little minigame for me (and the gifts I was giving to the guild), but yeah, they used to be a lot more lax.
---
Welcome to the World of server is down.
---
Uhh theres a guild recruitment google doc with like hundreds of guides on it.
---
Just google like classic wow reddit guild recruitment google doc
---
It's more worser dan dat mon.
---
It also makes it harder to predict boss damage output.
---
there was literally the weekly thread for this question today fyi
---
Grasping at straws are we?
---
Funny thing is, if it was a video the players would still be static.
---
Good to know, though I won't be playing hunter I'll pass the knowledge along.
---
Hi, /u/dprijadi
---
No, don't add anything to this game, I want the same content as I had 15 years ago to stay the same forever.
---
I don't like change.
---
From the official forum posts I've read, looks like a LOT of retail players won't play purely because of no transmog.  Was surprised how overwhelming that sentiment was and seemed like a very strange nail for the coffin but wtf do I know about retail.
---
Anyways, looking forward to my gear being meaningful again.  :)
---
I still got 3 unused 10 days Guest pass key from my original WOW Game Box.. i hope they still works in WOW Classic cum August
---
Always. Dwarves are cool.
---
Not counting starting zones (elwyn forest and tirisfal glades are god tier), 
---
1)Duskwood, prob the best questing in the game, cohesive story and creepy atmosphere
---
2)STV, TON of iconic quests there, also nothing is more fun that being ganked by a t2 Rogue
---
3) Hillsbrad Foothills, PVP grat quests there, i love the enviorement there
---
4)Azhara, great in everything except for questing
---
5) WPL and EPL, Great but hard as fuck quest there, iconic quest givers like Tirion Pamela and Nathanos
---
don't you have some prune juice to drink gramps
---
God I remember chasing down people using carrot, spurred boots and enchanted gloves. “I’m gaining on youuuuuuuu.....”
---
Did you post that link then edit your original post? I don't think i'm going crazy but...
---
my post was satirical
---
pathetic
---
Kalimdor was probably down
---
Yes, thanks for explaining how sarcasm works.
---
Its cause Dwarves are ugly, thats where the kinship feelings come from
---
So you're asking how Blizzard could have solved making Vanilla wow from becoming a collaboration of all the buffed/eziest forms of its existence?.....
---
Yeah, you're right. No way they could do anything..... anything at all... like keeping the debuff slots @ 8 like it was and then increasing to 16 on that raid tier's release that corresponded to that change.... that would be a very unrealistic expectation! Do you think they really have the money/manpower to be bothered with editing a single value like that one time? Of course not. 
---
Honestly, your wisdom has shown me the errors of my ways with your 187 IQ logic. 
---
I am going to never post on the interwebs again, out of my shame oh wise master.
---
I agree, there's quite a bit of negativity. I think it's because they feel like Activision-Blizzard has strayed away from the vision and values that were started in Vanilla WoW. It was inevitable that the tension, distrust, and anger would boil up to the surface. Even if there are some issues I will still play Classic because that's the game I love - flaws and all.
---
Wow this is awesome! 1% less hit, will open up so many new equipment combos. New BiS list need to be made!
---
Also wow 14% parry is gunna make tanking much harder I think.
---
Apologies for not being especially helpful, but I just had to say this.
---
-----
---
For the Horde!!!
---
&gt;Is there anyone that actually says the current implementation of layering is bug free and perfect?
---
You're mistaking this as a criticism of the current implementation of layering, but it's more likely a criticism of layering as a concept, of which there are many people defending.
---
It makes me so happy knowing there will be layering, despite its flaws. I can't count the amount of times I've had to join groups and hope to snipe mobs before other people do.
---
I'm interested in seeing the end cascading result of this. Reduce amount of threat you can generate, take more damage. If armor values are higher on classic compare to private servers, or resistances it's going to be a diff ballgame I feel
---
Mob was at 10% health while one party member was full health and the other was above half. It was not to help finish it off.
---
Classic is Classic  , do not add or remove feature from it
---
It’s funny watching the normie wow sub devour itself
---
Beta is confirmed to be 60/60 for 2 players, we dont know yet if it is a bug or not
---
I didn't see it. Sorry.
---
Even at level 19 for WSG it stood out. Get a boar with that charge/stun, so good.
---
Yeah, that's how I understand it as well.
---
It's great for PvP. Chasing down the cowards.
---
lol.
---
I don’t think you removed it I can still see it lol
---
If it’s not turned on, does that mean the song plays once?
---
I'd give up reach and intensity for 4/5 imp immolate. Immolate is going to be a huge part of your damage, it'd be silly not to pick up as much as you can of imp immolate. Intensity is useless, you're never going to cast soul fire while anything is attacking you anyway. Reach is nice of course but not worth gimping your damage for which is the entire point of the spec.
---
Ahh okay
---
&gt; Today I learned that some people actually have to focus so hard on their rotation that they can't dodge anything.
---
It's not *hard* to do raid mechanics while a bunch of proc lights and timer icons and "Push X Now!" alerts are happening on the screen.  But it *is* annoying to have all that busywork minigame UI stuff between you and what's actually happening around your character.
---
To put it another way:  I do enjoy healing in Modern raids and dungeons because those spells are dynamic and entirely situational.  You have to be aware of where the other players are and what's happening to them (to know how much incoming damage to expect) and triage who should be healed first.  And those dynamic actions change for every fight, in addition to all the fight mechanics you have to do.
---
But DPS rotations feel (subjectively, to me) like a priority list minigame that has almost nothing to do with the encounter that you're doing.  Yes, you might decide to delay CDs a bit or something similar... but for the most part it's a game of "Press X when Y lights up".  And I don't want to play the same annoying minigame over and over for every fight, with the fight mechanics being something that happens in the background.
---
Im rolling a Hunter , fastest leveling to 60 , then rolling Mage and Warlock.. maybe lateeeeeeeeer i will roll paladin and rogue , and then priest and then warrior.. 
---
actually i am alt-o-holic and usually create one of each class (alliance) and ended up gettting confused on which char i should play everytime i log in
---
Think we had these, I didn't use many addons but IIRC

Yeah, tanks should have more damage incoming and less damage outgoing.
---
it happens
---
He doesnt have to control everything just a big enough %, and when they leave it causes a domino efect so even if you didnt knew you could get burned.  And yes theres people that only play on a server to have a chance to interact with them.
---
It was an instanced battleground, like Warsong gulch if i remember correctly. It would have just "taken place" in Azshara, with Azsharas art assets, like Warsong Gulch in Ashenvale/Barrens
---
"Too much damage"
---
I partially agree.  I think retail will continue to be successful but i think you underestimate the classic surge and staying power.  I didn't have to look far to realize 6 of my closest friends who all quit at cataclysm are planning out our vanilla resurgence.
---
From my experience vanilla players stuck around.  I had the same core guildmates for 2+ years... If even a fraction of them commit they'll stick around.  Of course we'll all be much less hardcore , I can't server first AQ40 this time around, but that doesn't lower my subscription price.
---
I want to go Warrior again like I did in Vanilla or Dwarf Priest for that wonderful Fear Ward.
---
Very nice
---
I was thinking warlock or warrior, but didn’t know what race.
---
yes until you go to another area with different music
---
anyone voting new content has brain damage and or low brain activity
---
I think it’s so dumb that people hang on the ball sacks of the streamers as though they’re better people than anyone else playing the game. They’re just like everyone else, why spend your time with their dick down your throat when you can enjoy any other part of the huge game?
---
Not saying this was the case for you, but I hope people are prepared for multiple hour wsg matches where they just need one more flag cap to win.
---
I was having fun learning the game and had time to spare then, so I didn't mind, but the longest wsg I participated in was over 4 hours long.  2v2 flag caps.  Then turned into the other team just farming us.
---
No knowledge at the time of if it was even beneficial to them for honor or game mechanics...just that the kills were well into the hundreds by the time it finished.
---
I hear warriors are a pain to level.
---
Rare spawns, resource farm, pvp escapes, pve grind contested areas, potentially missed communuty driven server events. A few examples how layering-layer hop can alter the meta or diminish your experience. 
---
Your arguments are funny at least, dont forget to change layer if there are too many of the opposite faction in STV.
---
UD Rogue was my first 60 at luanch, had a great time and IIRC I got rank 10 later on in pvp. I am going lock or shammy this time tho
---
obviously you do not read the original post where OP shotgun blast everyone as 'overselling classic' when there is no one over selling anything except those streamers and their fanboy supporters who constantly trying to advertise twitch streamers here.
---
&gt; Oh yeah. That too. I had completely forgotten about the runes. Which means that those going for a 2nd ID kill will need to farm MC trash for hours. Yikes.
---
And when Classic was merely rumored, I said it would take 4-5 weeks to down Rag on a *F R E S H* release....vs. the 10-14 realtime days people were claiming.
---
And I was laughed at. By September 20, 2019, we will know who's laughing last.
---
I personally will be in the Barrens, trying to hit Lvl 20 on my main.
---
Hunters were very unique and didnt have to worry about parries or dodges it was 8% (5% for Trolls using bows and Dwarves using guns)
---
Then don’t play at launch, wait a month
---
Yeah I guess that the main problem.
---
I haven't played since TBC. It's not even out yet and it's already consuming my life again (Twitch, Youtube Guides, etc.)
---
1. Layering
---
2. Group up. It took me 30 minutes to leave the starter area with level 5 from there on smooth sailing.
---
funny instead of discussing OP's blatant trolling accusation aka 'overselling' , you go ahead defending OP's trolling as if you are different account of OP aka playing sock puppetry..
---
So it doesn't really effect needing the 8 hit gear
---
My main in WoW had always been a hunter, i’m looking to try something different this go around.
---
It’s either priest, lock or shaman atm:
---
Lol this is awesome.
---
but i want to. low spawn rates doesnt add anything to the game other than making you wait around literally doing nothing. More beneficial to everyone if they just up the rates so people can actually do more than 1 quest ever 30 minutes
---
Hey man, I know it may sound weird but could you please be so kind as to try to confirm if seal twisting works aswell? I cannot get into the Beta but am considering Paladin. Would mean so much!
---
Isn't the beta servers down
---
Intelligent guy. Would smash. 8/10.
---
I always kind of liked 6 on the females.
---
Not possible by 40, not even close.
---
Unlikely but close (40-70% revered, comparing undead (penalty) to human (bonus)) at 60 through optimal questing.
---
Riding another factions mount is something you earn through additional effort (some grind) not just playing through normal.
---
As someone who hates basically every alliance race dwarves are the one exception theres no way i could ever hate a dwarf
---
Oh my god, memories of my druid healing the tank and him dying just came flooding back! I would be in vent being like "The heal went off I swear!" That happened fairly regularly in high intensity fights. One day I'll be yelling that again! Can't wait!
---
I quit during Cata and you're right, I honestly don't. I made a Warlock in Retail and I *didn't have Life Tap*. LIFE TAP!! Such an iconic Warlock ability, gone.
---
One of my other 3 mains, Shaman, is also a shadow of its former self. Totems as they originally existed are all but gone, replaced by trinket-like mechanisms instead. Shocks and weapon enchants seem to be gone/vastly changed as well.
---
The only one they have left to fuck is Druid. Maybe next expac they'll split it into 4 separate classes!
---
Alts are a fun part of the game, but they aren't exactly required. If someone loathes leveling, they could just stick to one character. I don't personally think alt characters should be any easier than the first one.
---
Imagine doing all the quests to get mallet, and using it once
---
What's your server called?   I've tried.to get into three pservers but no luck yet
---
Honestly after WC3 I was surprised the alliance wasn’t Theramore Humans, Orcs, and Tauren vs races of Eastern Kingdoms.
---
It's not quite that bad though because its 1.12 not vanilla launch patch.
---
Almost all specs are viable, however they are certainly not balanced, but if you don't mind being a bit undertuned you can play as any spec even oomkin.
---
Exactly.  I might have been confusing because I was replying specifically to what he was wondering about.  But yeah, that's why having Auto Shot in this addon would be so helpful: If Auto Shot would fire during Aimed Shot's casting, it has to wait for Aimed Shot to finish first.  While you technically don't "lose" the Auto Shot, if it keeps getting delayed repeatedly, the total amount of delay time will add up to several Auto Shots over the course of an entire encounter.
---
Or am I misunderstanding it?  I was sure that's how it is.
---
Best machinema series ever.
---
What does it mean for feral bear tanks who can't parry?
---
Part of the fun on a fresh server is grouping up with ur level 1 mates and slaying higher level boars 😂 No matter how fast the spawn rates are, if you’re playing the moment it releases you’re going to be stuck behind hundreds of other people doing the same quests.
---
Yeah kinda gave me a good three to decide between, plenty of time before release at least lol.
---
Worked for like the first hour or two and then Kalimdor world server started crashing constantly. EK is fine and just leveled my undead there. Wonder what is crashing Kalimdor so bad.
---
Original gun sound.
---
Original cheap shot sound.
---
Hi Fake
---
-Bone
---
It was probably changed during 1.11 or 1.12.
---
Yea some people talk about the look of their character as if it's a core part of their experience. I'm fine with that type of player sticking with retail. You want to look cool? Work towards it. No longer are we partially motivated by the new gear looking cool, since we can just wear our very favorite sets all the time.
---
Oh yeah, I know it's not a joke. But it's one of those not completely obvious parts of the game that a lot of people miss. The ones who know what's up get recognized.
---
Don't assume everything is a troll just because you don't agree. Be a tad more open minded.
---
Group up. It’s an MMO. It’s an incentive to be social. And it isn’t going to be like you are seeing on any Stress Test streams. Everyone is just pulling in to the one server streamers are on. Things are going to be spread out on other servers. The fear of starter zones being a problem is greatly exaggerated.
---
but it WAS there it's in the games files. They wanted to implement it, but probably ran out of time and had to abandon it.
---
It wasn't even that bad though. Just finishing up leveling a dwarf on the stress test. The wendigos were so camped it took an hour to get all the hide drops. The whole time I got to group a bunch of people and just shoot the shit while killing the mobs as they spawned. It was great!
---
So you're mad about 16 debuff slots? You'll get over it, no need to be so dramatic. Any other specifics that bother you?
---
Ted^X
---
No difference whatsoever. This is only about the boss parrying not about the tank parrying themselves.
---
What do you mean? You can accept and complete the imp quest starting at level 1.
---
try pservers then
---
I meant like where on the map. For instance WSG takes place between Ashenvale and Stonetalon, as indicated by the world entry locations. You can see similar with AV and AB. I'm just curious as to where these alliance and horde entry points might be. I'd love to explore them when the game goes live.
---
According to the biggest survey, the most played classes will be:
---
1. Shaman
---
2. Paladin
---
3. Warrior
---
4. Warlock
---
5. Mage
---
6. Rogue
---
7. Priest
---
8. Hunter
---
9. Druid
---
The funnest parts haha
---
This is my thought as well. Can't stay in for more than a few minutes. Takes a couple minutes to get back in as well. Seems like an improvement from last week though, so that's good. I'm thinking classic launch will be smoother than Vanilla.
---
Wait.  In classic wow you. An get your characters from your vanilla profiles activated?
---
Don't forget that, if my sense of things is right, a significant chunk of the Classic population is going to consist of old veterans.
---
We're not going to be as inclined to expect that kind of hyper-focused dedication out of our players and are likely to play smarter rather than harder.
---
We're also more equipped to be better organized than older groups. Things like Google Calendar are unbelievably useful. We're playing this BECAUSE we want to play with other people so there's a good chance we'll be looking to do that grinding business specifically with other people.
---
No doubt it'll be a slower endeavour but in my 30's I've certainly developed a better sense of what's important to me in this game and how to make sure even the solo grindy goals in the game are aligned with that.
---
Oh I misread the first post. Thanks.
---
It’s much better than the old rp style of carrying a ton of clothes around and clogging my bags lol.
---
Vanilla brain RP activated
---
I disagree, I do think it adds something to the game.  It changes the pacing.  Now, you obviously think that pacing change is negative but I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum and think its a positive.
---
Well he isnt playing the beta, given that he is now blind and all....
---
daoc phoenix is new and rocking still
---
&gt; And yes theres people that only play on a server to have a chance to interact with them.
---
This part I fully accept.
---
Thing is, I don't accept how long they might be willing to play just for that chance.
---
Also, the longer they play, the more invested in that character they are.
---
It has to be a single sided devotion/obsession to make someone willing to ignore everything else about their experience, the game, and the other people they meet to make them abandon something just because the person they were a fan of left.
---
There are plenty of games where you can just log in and hope to interact with a popular streamer that you like.
---
An mmo that can require days of time played to be at the same place they are and to get noticed and interact with them?  Not the same thing at all.
---
Just had a look thank you!
---
Was there a survey on factions and/or races?
---
Made it to level 5 as NE despite being constantly disconnected. Spider can send impossible lol.
---
I really only used them once: when I made my monk. It was good... up until I got to level 70 and found how much I'd have to drop to continue using them. 
---
Leather shoulders were not the easiest to come by. It was helpful to always have what was (more or less) BIS as I was face-rolling through the dungeon finder.
---
&gt; No Deathknighs
---
Well what do you expect the Edge Lords play? 😅
---
Seriously though the only thing I’m really looking forward to is the social aspect that an MMO should have.
---
Twitch.tv , go to the warcraft section and then you can find streamers that play on the beta, also you can search this sub for the matter. Asmongold changed layers 4 5 times in a row in 30 seconds, gathered an army of 200 people to pvp, only for the opposite faction to be on a different layer. People have no reason to maliciously abuse it right now in the beta cause there is no point really.
---
So yes, its easy to abuse,there is proof online to support that and people who  actually play the beta and know about vanilla already expressed their concerns .
---
Yeah, troll mage
---
Hit is only given in even 1% increments in Vanilla. There is no hit rating. I'm guessing weapon skills or buffs could be part of the reason why people might notice a miss with 8% hit.
---
&gt; Having to work at killing striders in the zone that's just outside the starting area when you've put on that many levels just makes it feel like the levels meant nothing.
---
Reminds me a bit of the first NFS Underground. That had a form of scaling through the intense rubberbanding AI. Upgrading your car meant nothing because the AI opponents got every part you did, and it was actually possible to beat the entire game with a completely stock car.
---
Is there any supporting data?  Any chance you can link to this information?
---
Not that I know of.
---
Loot and raid lockouts are a kind of "hidden feature" that don't get talked about much, but will have huge impact.
---
These 2 things pretty much necessitate being in a guild, which is a great thing.
---
I've probably tried logging into my character over 200 times between disconnects. Might give it a few before trying again. I have work I'm supposed to be doing lol.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b6l5jb/madseasons_poll_what_class_are_you_going_to_play/
---
yeah but if mc can be done by 20 level 50s, everyone's gonna be running around with epics.
---
I know I'm exaggerating, but i think you get my point.
---
Was this with Rar on Doomhammer? The screenshot looks so familiar down to the Boomkin!
---
You are insufferable
---
I don't think that the original writers are around and even if they are, it's been so long that I am sure what they make now will not be what they would have made 15 years ago.
---
Totally agree.  This is the most interesting blue post about mechanics we've had yet and this is a huge game changer with respect to private servers and similarity. 
---
I remembered back in the day that fury warriors were not super common and often didn't top DPS because they were threat capped.  This could be a big reason why Fury Warriors are so prevalent on vanilla pservers and have such a high dps lead over other classes. 
---
It will be really interesting because it could mean more healers required, less dps from fury warriors, and overall longer boss kill times.  
---
Super interesting.
---
Humble gold farmer, Broom is Lv3.
---
He's a bit of a controversial figure but that doesn't change the fact that he has done a lot for both vanilla and classic.
---
Holy Priest (with spirit tap and wand spec to help me along). Yes I know shadow is quicker, no I don't care. This is my return to adventure and I'm doing it verbatim as I did all those years ago.
---
I actually enjoyed the challenge.  Either group up or get better at right clicking and auto attacking.  I found that timing the spawns and being right next to them when they spawn works the best
---
It was originally between rogue, mage and hunter.  If I'm honest, mage was I'm sure what would end up winning in the end but suddenly tonight, I find myself considering trying out druid and learning it - which is weird for me as I've sworn off druids the entire 14 years I've been playing.
---
I agree with you 100% Cyprek. Leave the wife for telling you spending all of your time playing video games is a waste. Holy shit this subreddit. Playing video games is fine as long as it's responsible and you don't ignore real life responsibillities. Why should someone leave their wife for something like that? Even if she said that you're hobby is dumb, is that a reason to leave someone you're married too? jesus
---
Got it thanks!
---
I love it. You do you boo boo.
---
Don't know if I would want to be in a guild with a lot of the people on this subreddit tbh
---
I would prefer new content based on the content we never got in the past, like Azshara creator bg release or Emerald dream. But I like TBC too so I wouldn’t mind that either
---
My only problem with new classic content is scaling and the risk of it not matching the rest of classic. They would have to design it using the old standards.
---
Ehh. Not as bad some make it sound to be. They are just one of the slowest, that’s all.
---
Holy shit I had no idea private servers got this much wrong. I guess this goes to show just how impossible it is to try and create an emulator based on memories and written information. There's plenty of theorycrafting about vanilla, but who knows how much of it is correct? Clearly not this part of it.
---
Classic has already crushed such an insane amount of misconceptions about vanilla that came from private servers. I wouldn't be surprised if for example warriors aren't going to be the king of dps on classic as they are on private servers, because of a number of incorrect calculations like this.
---
We're talking about boss parry chance, not the tank's parry chance. Bears have a slight advantage in this situation compared to Warriors (more EH = better chance to survive unexpected burst damage), but not enough to make a difference. Druids are still better off-tanks and Warriors are still better main tanks.
---
I enjoyed them in tbc all those years ago
---
i mean, as long as you show up, you'll probably get a spot. just getting 40 people together will be enough of a chore.
---
I'd imagine it's something like that then, unless some things that said "+2% hit" was really "1.95%"and the game rounds it, but that'd be weird.
---
I guess weirded things have happened but that's just a quirk of the game I guess.
---
Awesome thanks. Yeah I’ve heard it’s good to keep a 1h and shield for tanking purposes. Will definitely take advantage of starting my own groups for dungeons
---
It's still needed based on the current server state tbh
---
It's what currently makes the servers able to handle a few hundred players unlike only \~80 on retail.
---
In addition to the constant Kalimdor DC's every few seconds with the "disconnect error message: WOW51900319" and the "World Server Down" re-login messages, I've experienced 6-7 game crashes with [this error message](https://i.imgur.com/6TBY5P6.png)
---
We have time to build a desire for improved vanilla.  But you won't convince me till I'm back in vanilla for multiple months and maybe I'll desire more than vanilla's glory.   But this is all I've wanted since WOTLK
---
Ohh interesting thank you
---
How can you tell?
---
I’m picking a mage I think, most likely undead. I really like being able to make my own food and water, and having portals is so hardy and helpful for 5 man dungeons while leveling up
---
Play a private server to practice your leveling.
---
I think the same thing about Stormx and a half dozen Druids spamming Moonfire mid in my WSG games while no one goes for the flag.  I'm a hypocrite, self hating Druid main though.
---
Money
---
No it shouldn't really affect that 8% hit requirement but if you are under the 8% hit it should help.  
---
However, it will substantially help for tanks, as well as having an impact on DW classes since 24% hit was not possible to get iirc.
---
Use this:
---
 [https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) 
---
Filter by alliance faction and priest class, then see that nearly 60% of people who pick alliance priest....pick a dwarf.  Don't think that being a dwarf priest will make you indispensable, there are a LOT of them out there...and given that the survey has 18,000 responses this should be fairly accurate.
---
It's going to be worse on the release... Right now the amount of players is still quite small. There aren't going to be million realms on release but there's going to be a ton of players. Grouping doesn't help when the zone is packed and there's no mobs in sight.
---
Did you just list all of the classes in no particular order? Just wondering because the poll definitely does not reflect your rankings
---
I don’t know why legion was better unless its the omgwtfbbq demon hunter demon raids wtf the legion aspect, which got old super quick for me.
---
Because you're being a pedant, which is tiresome for everyone. I didn't ask for your silly advice, what makes you think I would be grateful for it? How pretentious.
---
Also it's hair-trigger, not hairpin-trigger.
---
What form of premade queue dodging even exists in vanilla?
---
Im curious too
---
Way to go in depth. I’ll probly just stick with a good 2h my first play through but that’s still good to know
---
Yes it does. You have to divide all the non-Shaman non-Paladin answers by 2.
---
As an old DND min-maxer it really drove me nuts that racial stats were different from each other by a couple to like 5 points for the same class and IT MADE ABSOLUTELY ZERO DIFFERENCE.
---
Even in classic the stats on things are just too much. The difference of one point shouldn't be trivialized. On a d4 that's 25%!
---
I mean enhancement has frost shock, I don't think they are the reason for lost games any more than ret paladins
---
I ain't bein a zambie. The extra weapon skill by being not dead is too good to pass up.
---
Why would it not exist? Blizzard would have 100% kept multiple backups of multiple points of Vanilla for legal, historical reasons.
---
You wouldnt be able to raid with that build due to the threat
---
They absolutely should at least implement the dynamic spawn the original vanilla devs said was present. IE it spawns mobs if all of them are dead from the area.
---
But hit percentages in vanilla with maxed weapon skills should have been even percentages, right?
---
How do you expect them to know who played on private servers? A checkbox that says “I played on a private server” that literally everyone will check wether they did or not?
---
&gt; What we have now is a bunch of people worried about beta world firsts
---
I wouldn’t consider a few bigger streamers as a bunch.
---
You choose the Axe as any race.
---
If you're using 2h you will(should) be Arms.
---
Flat 5% Crit &gt;&gt;&gt; sword/mace spec procs.
---
The weapon skill bonus will not be a huge benefit as a warrior as you are not likely to be trying to fight too many mobs that exceed your level.
---
&gt;One raid difficulty with some bosses having hardmodes triggered thorough in-game means
---
This would basically kill hardcore raiding. You can't go back from Mythic difficulty now, any guild who is doing cutting edge will stop through those raids in less than 2 weeks. HM Mimiron was cool at the time but it's not even comparable in difficulty to Heroic Jaina let alone Mythic bosses. And there is simply no way that the HM would be Mythic difficulty, it would be Heroic. 
---
&gt;No division of pve/pvp loot, like vanilla.
---
Everyone who PvPs right now complains about having to run raids to get trinkets for doing Arena, when they don't want to raid. Everyone has complained about this since TBC. 
---
&gt; Each raid tier comes with 2 raids, 1x20 man and 1x10 man. 20 man raid drops new tier loot, 10 man raid drops previous last tier loot. 
---
&gt;Minimal ilvl difference between raids,
---
The issue with this is item level doesn't necessarily make an item better, stat allocation and effects matter a lot too. People have a limited raid schedule every week and most people by and large prefer doing new content to old. Having a system like this basically forces people to spend a lot more time farming out old raids when what they want to be doing is progressing on new raids. Even in the worlds now where there are large item level difference between raids, it often happens that some people farm the old tier for trinkets with particularly powerful procs and effects. And when that happens those people always complain about it because it takes up so much time.
---
Just did a wsg on stress-test, the other team had a 19 and we won 3-2. That was so much fun!
---
this is false
---
Yeah super unanimous lol...
---
Fuck you lol.  This is my summer out of college, I wanna no life, not have zero time to play when classes start up 2 days after the game comes out.
---
Bigger issue is the delay in the entire client. Clicking on vendors, looting, etc.
---
Christ Almighty - when there is so many goddamn name tags you can't see the center of the crowd.
---
Classic: Extended Edition
---
You won’t be able to use searing pain as a filler due to its high threat
---
Feel good about this comment champ? Cause it sounds like a bunch of troll mumbo jumbo
---
Literally the only reason I'd ever consider playing alliance.
---
Basically destroys most/all of the "we're just better" theorycraft. People are probably better at the game but that doesn't account for doing like double the DPS that people did in 2006, lol
---
But plays his priest more atm which I find pretty funny.
---
Oh okay I see what you mean, but that’s assuming there’s actually a 50/50 split
---
This should be reason enough right here to end layering on the spot. It will kill the entire game's economy.
---
It may not be popular in this sub but over on r/wow it’s usually mentioned as the best period of the game.
---
That's a valid point, but I really rather not drop reach. I'd probably drop improved searing pain to 2/5 and intensity instead to hold onto reach.
---
I can top it.  I think pre cata patch or pre Icecrown patch in wrath for Arcane mage.
---
I never PVPed seriously but they broke something in late Wrath.  Full raid gear arcane, I was tab targeting 1-shotting every single other character.
---
I was GCD capped at 1 second too.  The first 2 arcane blast stacks would 2 shot the first victim in 2 seconds.  As long as I had targets, it was literally tab target and delete them, no matter the gear.
---
Last 1-2 nights and then got patched but was the most epic time I ever had in a BG.
---
I think the problem is that stuff like this changed from patch to patch. So if they changed the formula in, let's say, 1.11 most of the old videos and theorycrafting stuff you will find from the vanilla period will be talking about different numbers.
---
Will WSG be in classic?
---
I think that's not entirely a reasonable expectation. Power creep isn't just higher ilvl gear it's just as easily better itemized gear.
---
If you take a leather piece 10 str, 10 agi, 10 stam piece of gear and make that in to 20 ap/10 agi/10 stam. 
---
Now you've got power creep as far as rogues are concerned.
---
It's an inherent part of the D&amp;D games that WoW comes from. Things are treadmilly. In D&amp;D you hit the reset by making a new character, maybe playing with a new group/DM which MMOs need to either accept indefinitely or find another method (ex: expansions).
---
I like the IDEA behind what you're saying I just don't see the HOW to do it. :(
---
&gt; Is this in relation at all to how streamers are able to tank mobs 20+ levels higher than them, survive and even kill them with big enough groups
---
You could do the exact same thing in 2006. This post verifies it.
---
Sehr lecker😛
---
This is exactly what the people want.
---
I don't think he's going to read this.
---
I think i just remembered that "World Server is Down" meant only EK/Kalimdor back in the day
---
Classic releases the day before I go back to work after 1 month off 😢
---
Nah. I’m good. So many of them filing but reports saying “this is incorrect” isn’t helpful either. Especially when Blizzard has come out and said almost everything private servers did was wrong.
---
Also, by what metric does Blizzard gauge who played on a private server or not?
---
There is absolutely zero means of “inviting more pserver players” because there’s no way to track them except someone says so.
---
Jealous! It releases the day before I go back after 1 month off 😂
---
Mythic raiding is challenging. Dark Souls is challenging. Vanilla wow isn't
---
Even if it’s undertuned you under estimate how bad people can be at video games lol. You might see a decent amount of tier 1 but bwl will destroy moron pugs. Private server and vanilla vets will be ok though. But razor gore will gate keep morons from even getting past him lol
---
If an average player took an approach to “complete” each class from the start of vanilla in 2004, they probably still wouldn’t even be done yet.
---
lol.  "video games are an addiction for stupid people".  
---
But hey, my wife told me if she knew I was a gamer before she met me, she wouldn't have given me the time of day.
---
I don't know if I'll play Classic, but if I do, it'll like you said .. 5 hours a week.
---
Orc is the most overrated race when it comes to PvP.
---
You also have to play the game on a P4/Athlon with 256MB of memory and Geforce 3 graphics card.
---
&gt; Proving grounds was probably the best solo skill check there is in the game.
---
Maybe you didn't have a 20-player team to clear the latest raid, or not enough time to farm all the gear to max out your ilvl... but that didn't matter with the Proving Grounds.  Either you had the dedication and skill to do it or you didn't, and if you managed it you got a title to show off your effectiveness in your chosen role.
---
It would be nice to see something like that in Classic some time after the original patch schedule ends.
---
Are there bgs and wsg in classic ?
---
I want to do the quest more than having the mount. Those epic quests are so great and the reason I will play classic and a warlock.
---
It sure is friend.
---
I wonder if it might not be faster to do a STV/Stormwind route, reaching Kalimdor via Ratchet.
---
Was able to log in for a little while, but upon exiting Stormwind to head to Goldshire, no NPCs popped up, resting areas didn't register as resting areas (inns, etc.) and I couldn't log out/exit game, had to force close it. Now getting the "World Server Down" error when logging in...I know this is the first Stress Test (technically 2nd I suppose), I really hope this is fixed by the next one. I was able to play the 2nd day of the first test pretty fine (some issues, not many) but kinda defeats the purpose of trying to get everyone to log in when people can only stay logged in for a few minutes max before being booted out.
---
Yeah there's a very good reason for the gear reset. It's impossible to design new post naxx content for vanilla that is fun and interesting for both non raiders and raiders - one is in ilvl 65 gear and the other is in ilvl 90 gear. That's the entire reason they redid the level cap and redone the end game with actual content not just for raiding but for 5mans and pvp as well.
---
But zambies r gud
---
Im just gunna chill. Try some pvp In each bracket and just enjoy the journey once again. No rush to 60 (for me anyway).
---
Except this vid doesn’t show any issues - this is working as intended.
---
&gt;De-Man
---
The reference escapes me, sorry.
---
True, but at least they're diligent enough to put in the work - right or wrong.  
---
Meh, those guys have their own celebrities.

 Source "If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill (level * 5) and your Weapon Skill ([level * 5] + additional bonuses) is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:
---
5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill).1% dual-wielding: 24% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill).1% If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:
---
7% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10).4% dual-wielding: 26% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10).4%"
---
Which means 305 weapon skill vs Boss' 315 defense gives you a base chance to miss of only 6%. (Free 2% according to the bluepost or 3% according to most private server coding)
---
Although this may be incorrect formulas based on this new blue post.
---
You'd think so honestly but games are janky.
---
You forget about the legions of fans who do nothing but care about their beta world firsts.  lol.
---
I think DPS will be marginally lower. Bosses will dodge 1.1% more often than pservers, that feels more impactful than the few extra stat points you can get by swapping out a piece of hit gear for something else.
---
Searing pain will pull mobs off the tank very easy, but I like the idea of having a strong immolate with DS
---
edited original comment
---
Why did I know you wouldn't have a real answer lol. Layering = money, what a joke.
---
&gt; I wasn’t the biggest private server fan to say the least. All this time, busting them for their guess work and inaccuracies.
---
I was against the whole pirating thing.  I thought 'boycott them and keep telling blizz I wanted classic'.  I know, argue for pirating however you want, it's just my personal feeling, and we all know how personal feelings can range.
---
&gt; But, like I said the jokes on me. I laughed at them for making it too easy, when it was the other way around.
---
This makes it sound like all private servers were harder than vanilla WoW, which I find hard to believe.
---
&gt; But we need that crowd now. Why? Some of those guys are crazy. Like sit in your room for 100 hours, not eat, and crunch numbers and search web archives crazy. We need their work ethic, their expertise in getting old videos, and their passion for the game to actually test this.
---
This is making it sound like a lot of vanilla WoW players aren't the same...that are currently waiting for beta invites.
---
&gt; Because let’s be honest. You think all these people clamoring to play beta are doing it to find bugs?
---
Of course not.  I just don't think there's any appreciable difference between the private server community and live WoW community in this regard.  (Or former WoW community, or however they overlap)
---
&gt; What my point? As much beef as I had with the pserver player base in the past, the passion they have for making it a better Vanilla experience is unmatched.
---
It's unmatched?  How is that?  It may be true, and I'm willing to have my perspective changed, but you've given me absolutely nothing to prove it.
---
&gt; What we have now is a bunch of people worried about beta world firsts.
---
We have high profile people and people that aren't in beta worried about that (although, beta world firsts don't really exist in any way or matter to, well, more people than they matter to.)
---
Again I'd ask, what data really backs this up?  Is this just a feeling?  Based on social media?  Based on any real metrics?
---
I also care about people in the Beta making sure the game is as good as possible, but from what I can tell, that encompasses the majority.  Do you have any real proof that shows that to be false?
---
What are the supposed advantages to having this in the game? Less people to compete for mob tags? If so, why would they waste time implementing this when it will only be a problem at the very beginning of release, and if you're too slow, you level slower, tough. If you want to play ez mode and just run around tagging other players mobs, go play Retail.
---
Not officially but I'm almost of the opinion it doesn't need an announcement because it is a given. I mean, we do have those servers in Sydney(?) after all.
---
.. I hope I'm right. Lol. Getting 50ms on classic will be a dream come true.
---
Unless you stance dance a lot and decide to Overpower, yes, there's a damage loss.
---
Definitely will because even if a server required 9% to hit cap you can get 9% hit on gear. 
---
You can't eliminate that 1.1% dodge chance.
---
Those dinosaurs cant catch a break even in a parallel universe-layer
---
Layover
---
Yeh this guy literally just made a case for why retail will be better than classic once before have raids on farm status.
---
no ur wrong
---
Can you upgrade them to purp or do they have to be blue?
---
Plenty of other games available that have quick respawns.
---
It's classic which is based off vanilla.
---
You don't have to play it.
---
Damn that boss parry difference is HUGE, considering a boss parrying makes his next attack quicker. Broodlord gonna be even scarier.
---
I'm trying to figure out why I care about Beta world firsts, I hardly care about retail world firsts.
---
^World firsts are really neat, but I'm not going to be bummed about missing out haha.
---
People are concerned with a divided community if that happens.
---
I just wanted to say good luck. We're all counting on you.
---
Tried making an Undead after all the claims (both here and in the stress test General chat) that EK is fine, but still receiving the "World Server Down" error.
---
Just jump on it’s back. Problem solved.
---
I think the opposite is likely what he meant to say. Miss chance due to the formulation may be like 8.1% whereas players are only able to actively improve hit chance by percent values (except in the case of weapon skill which can be altered in numerous ways and falls into formula values). At the end of the day, it's probably just easier to be safe and "over cap" yourself.
---
I hope they stop after Wrath though
---
That's generally a good idea. When I level an alliance warrior my plan for guaranteed quest weapon progression is [Staff of Westfall](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2042) from DM quest -&gt; [Whirlwind Axe](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6975) from the infamous level 30 warrior quest chain. Then swapping to dual wield using the [Sword of Serenity](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6829) and [Vanquisher's Sword](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10823) quest rewards. Upgrade main hand to [Thrash Blade](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17705) from maraudon quest. Supplement with random dungeon drops and AH bought upgrades when I can spare the money.
---
I think they have an opportunity to do it all over again.  I know one of the biggest WTF moments was the opening of the portal to the Outlands.  The FIRST green drop you got was equivalent or better than tier 3.  At least make tier 3 relevant up until the low-mid 60's.  Give those who really worked hard a leg up at the start of the new content.  I dunno, I'm not game dev but I kinda wish they had a slower progression between the expansions.
---
For warriors yeah, assuming they don't lose too much rage and also aren't t already threat capped since the tank will be making something like 10% less threat.
---
Imagine ‘legendaries’ like in legion that change spells to change the classes. Like a cloak that reduces the threat and mana cost of mind blast to make shadow priests somewhat relevant in raiding.
---
People dont seem to understand that relationships are give and take, we dont know the backstory op could have a history of playing excessively and ignoring his partner or she could have had an ex that did that which formed her opinion, instead of leaving maybe talk to each other and figure out a healthy medium...
---
Leveling, there's a quest chain ending with a quest to kill Van Cleef. So players would spam chat for killing Van Cleef or VC. You don't know it's called the Deadmines until you zone in.
---
You're objectively wrong in both your statements
---
There's a certain project.. called ascension.. that lets you pick your stats/skills and has hardcore servers where you can loot other players.
---
Except for the most important one, BLOODLUST.
---
Lol tbc.
---
You just pushed one of my memories back out...i remember In TBC when talbuks were introduced, I really wanted the all black one with yellow eyes...significantly different than the normal ones. I thought "if I ever get warrior T6 gear (black with yellow accents) this'll look so dope". It was a world PvP reward, and was terrible at PvP and geared/specced for raid tanking, but dammit if I didn't plug away in halaa in my tank gear scraping up just enough to finally buy it. Greatest feeling ever. Never did get to see it with t6 gear though :(
---
Are you saying servers aren't expensive to run? You're talking about a company that laid off thousands of people in its most profitable year ever and gave the CEO the biggest bonus in years?
---
Is that your argument?
---
Why are you answering when he spoke to another? :O
---
I cannot express how much I hate sharding. It's one of the biggest issues I have with retail.
---
The only WOW I played was vanilla. I sold my account for $350 a week before BC launched. Check yourself. You can go play your nonsense utopia on retail right now.
---
We want fucking classic, not classic-plus. Not classic, but like, with "quality of life" improvements.
---
I'm really on the fence with my warrior race. I find humans boring and they get so "blah" after a while but that sword spec is just too nice.
---
On the other hand all my original toons in vanilla were gnomes. I personally love their animations and you can't beat escape artist as a warrior. 
---
Good thing I have 3 months to think it over.
---
Where’d you see no DM?
---
&gt; I laughed at them for making it too easy, when it was the other way around. I think this needed to be said given the title of the post.
---
Source? 
---
Seems like all signs point to private servers being easier.  I haven't seen any actual evidence that private servers were actually harder other than some anecdotal shit about aggro ranges and etc.  
---
It appears that many aspects of actual classic are harder.  From monster damage to raid boss mechanics.
---
Here's a video of Joana doing it at level 1
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/430874561?t=01h36m03s
---
&gt;Thats just an example, but Imo it would have been a much better option to do horizontal progression over rendering all the previous content obsolete every single expansion.
---
YESSSSSSSSSSS. This is 100% what they need to do. Raiding for a year to get full sets replaced almost instantly by greens and blues is just... dumb... imo. They also need to tone down the "power" of the expansion items so people who are a bit slower can still go do the vanilla raids with the new expansion gear but not be so OP. Keep it ALL relevant Blizz.
---
PvE server - go holy pally, will be plenty of rogues to group with.
---
Why do people feel the need to be a private server apologist. "Wow these people who spent thousands of hours to recreate something I personally want to play got some details wrong".
---
You don't need into the beta. You already are one.
---
People inspect in retail?
---
Don't ask questions if you don't actual want the answer.
---
They don't need the loot, it's open beta. Far better to share the experience with more people.
---
- Don't fight more than 1 thing at a time
---
- Hamstring is your friend against humanoids
---
- At level 30 get someone to carry you to a free Whirlwind Axe
---
Launch day is always a crazy mess and not everyone can't stand it. 
---
Some suggestions :
---
1) log in a few days later
---
2) move out of starter zone and just kill mobs to get to level 3-5
---
3) group up
---
Yep, though these days it’s mostly to look at a passing transmog. Then they see the carrot down in the little corner there.
---
make some
---
Devilsaur Farming, Black Lotus Farming
---
You're telling me Blizzard would rather have less money than they could otherwise? I'll just wait for the next big private server launch then and blizzard gets no money from me.
---
The appeal of classic is that blizzard could provide a superior classic experience. If they purposefully choose not to create a closer experience, they'll use business to whomever is doing it better.
---
wait, you can queue BG's into the beta players? LOL
---
Bank alt has to be a level 49 hunter with full twink gear. Full 18 slot bags as well.
---
Not on purpose, it was a big. Not sure why so many downvotes lol
---
I stopped playing like a month into Cata.
---
I'm just happy for the original races and Shammy and Pally being faction locked. I really liked TBC, but I hated this more than I hated flying mounts or resilience. 
---
If they ever did a TBC server I would be #SomeChanges lol
---
this is where my addiction to incremental games must have started...
---
Haha yah I could see that being the case. When I played retail recently I only inspect people that did good dps of the same class. Otherwise I was logging in thinking how many more turtles I'll have to save, then logging out.
---
It's not until phase 2, some time after launch:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the\_complete\_classic\_plan\_pve\_pvp\_phases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the_complete_classic_plan_pve_pvp_phases/)

Not true. I've been playing on LH and am hyped for classic
---
I bet you could take it.
---
Great answer, this is my attempt. How else would you suggest I make virtual friends for a game that's not out yet ?
---
Everyone’s entitled to their opinion, but once again I don’t think our definitions of challenging are the same. Dark Souls and Classic are both challenging in the sense that they require immense amount of patience. Mythic raiding is challenging because it employs an intense amount of mechanical skill and situational awareness to make it possible. 
---
Stop looking at the game through such a close minded view of difficulty, that’s what ruined the game in the first place. Thinking challenging has one definition is absurd, it changes situationally. Since classic and retail are entirely different games at this point, they’re entirely different situations.
---
Yeah, i actually hated how they made shamans in WoW haha.  
---
No dual wield despite shamans in WC3 clearly using dual claws, no bloodlust, no wolf summoning... 
---
But I eventually just accepted it was a different game even if it made no sense to me in light of WC3
---
If you're going to level as fast as possible and be in the first group to be progressing, then it will be the same as every expansion.  Provide what is needed and in short supply on your server.  (Since you're talking about phase 1 and all, I assume this is what you're worried about.)
---
That can be done with any profession/class combo (although is generally easier and more guaranteed with two gathering professions than with one gathering/crafting prof).
---
If you're going for the max profit as soon as possible, then an alt will just waste time and lose you money over getting your main as high as possible.
---
Study the auction house, general chat and trade chat.  Use any addons and sites possible for tracking trade information.  Be willing to grind mobs and rare spawns and drops.
---
In the end though, you have to remember that there just won't be as much gold early on as there will be later.  It's not like other players will have a supply of gold just laying around...they'll all be building it as well.
---
"More servers" doesn't work.
---
If the population of a classic server is 3k, but 5k want to play with a top streamer you have a problem. You can either cap it in which case tough shit to whomever was billed to be in the streamer's main guild but didn't make the cut and you lose potential subs, or you up the pop count and come up with some other solution.
---
Omg... I hope they reconsider and bump Warsong up one phase.
---
You can easily find a spot as a prot warrior. For rogue, fury warrior, and Hunter - they're all definitely wanted in raids it's just you have more competition for the raid spots.
---
You are incredibly naive if you think they are testing this just for the sake of throwing it out. They've outright stated their plans to implement layering across the whole world for at least a couple weeks. You're clearly in denial about it.
---
Only reason I enjoyed transmog was so I could use the old school gear sets cause the new ones are trash lol
---
In the same boat - or at least my old wow friends are dumb and "don't want to pay for content they already played"
---
I plan on finding a guild when server names get released.
---
I think some play but they're super casual and therefore prefer the theme park design. They can keep retail but they REALLY need to listen to ideas like this thread for classic. When all my gear was replaced so quickly in Burning Crusade even before the raids of Outlands... that is where they started losing me and a lot of people. Sure we played but it just didn't feel the same. It was never the same.
---
Maybe allow some of the newer content to power up, or transform some of the older gear. That way you would still need farm the older content to progress . 
---
Heroic mode could a way to add new bosses and mechanics . Have it to where you can’t use that new gear sets in the old non heroic dungeons/raids . This would help keep everything fresh and prevent people from getting carried for gear .
---
I wish I knew. 
---
For a long time I was set on Gnome Warlock.   But I'm also feeling pull for some kind of Rogue (maybe nelf or gnome).  Also considering resto shaman, troll priest, or troll warrior if I go horde.
---
Unrecognizable lmao
---
It's true.  I work in automation and I'll often get emails that state the automation system did something weird.  
---
I always respond;  "did you report it so the logs got captured?"  
---
"no"  
---
"Okay, not much I can do about it, let me know next time and make sure you report it so logs are captured."
---
I remember this. It came with a new talent where arcane blasts put slow debuff on enemies and there was another talent that enemies with slow debuff took extra damage. It was the most busted thing ever and the most fun I’ve ever had playing mage. It was wotlk or cata pre patch can’t remember either. I could delete someone in 3 seconds with arcane blast + pom + arcane blast. Good times.
---
Who will have gold at this point to buy these from you?
---
Wouldn't it be better to farm what you need to get the BoE crafted stuff crafted?
---
I though it was public as their publicly available to anyone !  :p
---
No such thing as almost won lol 😂 I’ve almost won the lotto a billion times then 😂
---
Sorry but you’re clueless. He’s level 30 and therefore didn’t need the experience. If you mean experience in the colloquial sense the answer is clearly that they were being nice, but also that they diluted their chances of rolling on a rare item had it dropped.
---
Either way, you were wrong about them needing help to kill the mob.
---
this type of stuff can kill random player interactivity lol, hope its something they can fix.
---
Just tested this in Beta. Tried to just level as suggested while getting the 54 linen cloth. I can confirm that 60 does not drop causally as you do the humanoid quests by the time you reach 10. I had to farm from 10-11 on Scarlet Friars and Zealots in order to get all 54.
---
Elemental mage. Good luck.
---
Will there be server transfers? Mass migration could happen too, i agree classic is a different game so maybe investment to the character can be bigger, but damn those streamers do have a strong pull and people are crazy, well see when we get there.
---
Thanks for the reminder, after farming felwood for essence of water to get my mount, this trinket made me feel awesome lol
---
I believe this is 99.9% because of Gimli and LOTR movies  coming out while Classic was out
---
pserver easymode strikes again
---
I wouldn’t go that far. But, this seems more salty, than anything else.
---
I like that the Aquatic Form quest is a pain in the ass. Aquatic Form isn't a core Druid ability. It's just cool as shit and nice to have for world PvP. If you don't want to struggle for it at level 16, then you can do that quest at 60 (or never) and it won't hurt you.
---
Water totem, on the other hand, is essential. Forget the healing and mana totems - poison cleansing totem is the most overpowered shit of all time. You need that shit as soon as possible. No skipping that one.
---
Most likely only the high pop realms will have layering after the initial launch days
---
I exclusively play Tauren characters and I feel the same way about dwarves!
---
Incorrect.
---
If course finding peeps before could benefit you. I am uncertain if I'll play or if i do im not sure of my faction.
---
That's the thing about wow classic is there is much more interaction and opportunities to make friends. Of course, it won't completely be the same as vanilla but I'm surein your travels there will be friendly people who will welcome you.
---
True although you can use Abolish to predict a Blind and that is another trick Druids have up their sleeves against rogues.
---
me: japanese and chinese isn't the same thing
---
you, apparently: is this a retail apologist?
---
It should be working at this point. Hope you're in by now
---
The /who would have to match the location, class, and level of them.
---
This thread is full of absolute gems of progression ideas. I just hope Blizz pays attention to people who actually know wtf they're talking about. Listen to these people... do not make the same mistakes twice guys. Please.
---
It's classic. You will find friends by playing the game.
---
I've been getting in. Still getting disconnected...
---
I think the main problem was that they went too far with every expansion, adding things like flying and making hard to obtain gear from the previous expansion obsolete almost instantly. They always want the new expansion to just replace everything instantly for whatever reason.  Scaling helped ruin this even more because the numbers just spike randomly even without gear or getting a new skill.  
---
One other thing about vanilla was you were all just players in WoW, some were hardcore some weren't, but good or bad you fought with and against each other in the world and in BGs. These days you have people that play for the pet battles. People that only play for ranked battlegrounds. People that only play for Arena. People that only do mythic dungeons. People that only do mythic raids. People that only do world quests. They've intentionally segregated their community by removing the incentives to explore other content and meet other people, you just get pigeonholed into doing what you know and only associating with those that do what you do.
---
I liked Legion
---
Found the hunter
---
Materials, mostly. Things that help folks kit up their mains and alts. 
---
* Felcloth/Mooncloth -&gt; Bags. Just like, bags in general will be selling like hotcakes. 
---
* All rare materials - Devilsaur, Lotus, Arcane Crystals, etc.
---
* Molten Core crafting items and Dark Iron (can probably lump this in with the above). 
---
* Maraudon runs (potent for pet classes - hunter/lock).
---
* Assisting lowbies. Loads of folks will want help getting Verigan's Fist, WW Axe, etc.  Opening UBRS with the ring. 
---
Those are the ones off the top of my head. Playing the AH and being the lord of bags, rare mats and world drops will make mountains of gold.
---
I didn't say they *needed* him. Work on your comprehension.
---
You'll be fine with this gear:
---
Mask of the Unforgiven - Stratholme
---
Mark of Fordring - EPL Quest
---
Truestrike Shoulders - UBRS
---
Deathdealer Breastplate - BRD
---
Battleborn Bracers - UBRS
---
Reiver Claws - LBRS
---
Omokk's Girth Restrainer - LBRS Quest
---
Blademaster Leggings - UBRS
---
Blackstone Ring - Mara
---
Painweaver Band - UBRS
---
Blackhands Breadth - UBRS Quest
---
Blackcrow - LBRS
---
Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge - UBRS
---
Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian - UBRS
---
my bad, should have been more transparent.
---
We still don't know about armor value and magic resistances of bosses.
---
Private servers use generic values instead of specifics for each boss but the question is, are these generic values higher or lower.
---
More like salty and sweet, pros and cons baked into it. Like a realist pie.
---
In regards to damage from elite mobs in dungeons, it seems like private servers are about 200% higher than in the beta. However, Blizzard still has not commented on this, so there's likely something strange going on or they would have quickly added it to the "Not a Bug" list. I'm actually hoping Blizzard is wrong, I want harder dungeons.
---
Depends on what you plan on doing. For me PvP is important, I like tanking, I don't like chasing hard to obtain gear.
---
Druid.
---
2h Fury will do slightly more damage with malice, imp bs, and enrage but if you plan on doing a bit of pvp, leveling arms isn't a bad plan. As a warrior, you're gonna get kited. Alot. And your only native defense to that is intercept which you get at 30. But you can't effectively use it without having a minimum of 7 points in Arms for 2/5 Tactical Mastery which will allow you to do a little stance dancing. So to be truly effective in wpvp, you'll need to either be 7/14/0 at 30 (which I wouldn't recommend), respec and waste a gold, or be strictly arms while leveling. 
---
Personally I'm just going to stay arms the whole time. The small difference in dmg from 10-30  isn't really worth the gold to respec later.
---
Sorry that I upset you, wasn't my intention
---
oh no no no pservers are supposed to be harder, delete this.
---
Even though I don't like the idea of dynamic respawns, it still beats layering.
---
Everything is significantly harder on Pservers. Every OG private server player who got into the beta is saying the same.
---
What's wrong with Russians?
---
Jokes aside, I do miss the community aspect. Especially in battle grounds where each side had that one guy/gal who dominated.
---
Why would I find all of these ez-mode buffs a good thing? Are you Legion baby? 
---
Maybe you should just stick to BFA?
---
I like the philosophy. I also plan on playing a weird Priest spec just for the fun of it.
---
I made these several years ago but dug them out recently. I'm excited to get back into WoW after a long break.
---
Thanks for the link!  No bgs until phase 3!? F.M.L. That’s going to be a painful wait.
---
my favourite to use on gankers like this is /golfclap. like wow yeah real good there buddy you killed me at 1/4 hp such skill
---
Wow that was a lot lol.
---
I believe the consensus is that leveling is 30% harder in Classic than private servers.  But the private server dungeons were over-tuned compared to Classic.  The runs through Gnomer and SM at level 30  in Classic were pretty brain dead.  
---
It's late, i don't have time to dig up "proof", maybe tomorrow.
---
Streamers may only make up  fraction of the beta player base, but then we forget about their legion of fans who are streamer clones taking commands.
---
Mage.
---
&gt;	Because he could help them finish it off.
---
Play semantics if you want. “Could help” means he adds value and he added no value. 
---
&gt;	Oh no, they might lose loot in a beta where everything is going to be wiped out. OH NO!
---
You’re completely out of the loop on the Beta events.
---
1.12 is easier. Gear stats are higher and talents were buffed
---
Eventually, not on upon initial release. Phase 3 I believe
---
&gt;Great answer, this is my attempt. How else would you suggest I make virtual friends for a game that's not out yet ?
---
same way i did. LFG Monday. found a guild post in that thread that fit my play times and demographic. sent a message. got invited. talked to them on discord. grouped up during stress test and made it to lvl 9 with 4 of them.
---
I see a bunch of projection from both of you here. One person that's tried and failed and one that's never tried at all. Have fun you two.
---
Me neither. I just meant I made my Blood elf warlock at that point and it was a girl and all my mains after that were girls.
---
I didn't say anything about them testing to throw it out.
---
"Flummoxed"?
---
Leveling is harder on Classic.  But dungeon elite trash is a lot easier.  That's why there were so many reports on elite trash not doing enough damage.  Blizzard only verified that one example, which was a named mob (not trash) and never verified elite trash.  But so far, every "damage" related bug that was reported has been verified as "working as intended"  shrug.
---
Such being the case, private servers are over-tuned.
---
Unfortunately I'm not subbed ATM and don't plan on subbing until August
---
But I'm on another layer!
---
It wasn’t in the actual game for you to play. You you will more people against it then for it.
---
The trinkets my Mage has ATM (Fresh dinged 60) first was Six Demon Bag, Carrot on a Stick, Luffa (Removes one bleed effect) Uther’s Something (2% chance for a PW:S buff when hit) 
---
All the way up to 60 every trinket I had was very specific and quite random.
---
They didnt comment? They literally showed screenshots comparing Classic to their reference client in-house and showed the numbers were correct.
---
Cost is a good reason.
---
FF14 does it with two raid tiers, casual (puggable with complete randoms from FF14's LFR) and savage (requires a preformed group and lots of practice, unless you're playing in Japan). Besides base difficulty, the savage raids distinguish themselves by adding a big epic second phase to the final boss of each raid tier.
---
IMO it captures the best of both worlds. Casuals get to see the story, but there is truly impressive content that you can't see unless you put in the time and effort required for savage raiding. Only thing I would change to the basic model is to let people do savage without having to clear casual first (which kind of ruins the big story moments if you intend to do savage later).
---
You're right, my bad. Immolate is lvl 2 though
---
So what?  People farm all that shit while you sleep.
---
No dailies!
---
Damn I hope they have a 3 month beta test to sort this out
---
Mate they are amazing! Truly. Sensational job!!
---
This is such an odd take. Most raids are begging for more druids lol. It’s the easiest class to get a raid slot a majority of the time.
---
Except your numbers are complete bullshit because they are based on nothing.
---
Classic is way different than retail. You're forced to interact therefore leads to making friends. No press button and join group with solo loot. Levelling leads to lots of friends because how hard some quests/areas were without grouping.
---
It will be divided anyway when people don't want to move on to TBC.
---
You still living in your mom's basement?
---
r/murderedbywords
---
&gt;Because you're being a pedant, which is tiresome for everyone. I didn't ask for your silly advice, what makes you think I would be grateful for it? How pretentious.
---
You took a rudimentary and agreeable point (the one thing you're correct about is that the majority of players want guild banks) and managed to garner a majority downvotes due to prissiness. Had you refrained from the pre-emptive defensiveness and ad-hominems in the OP and added a compelling case to support your argument you'd have made a solid case. I realize this is useless wear-n-tear on my keyboard switches since you appear averse and adverse toward learning and growth. Maybe my brain is still in backpacking mode where I'm eager to help someone when they're struggling with something I see the answer to. Just wanted to help.
---
&gt;Also it's hair-trigger, not hairpin-trigger.
---
Ah crap, thanks. Hairpin sounded wrong in my head but it got a few Google results.
---
The point is that it is also ok to not be min maxed.
---
Its how i like to play reddit. How dare you tell me its wrong.
---
Honestly we'll find a way to toss them out of whatever server they are on. We will force them into a PvE server where they belong. Zero tolerance for streamers on my server.
---
That was for a particular boss in Deadmines, which wasn't relevant. Unless you can link it to me, I'm pretty sure they have not commented about it at all.
---
My 5 year+ old I5 4690k running over 4ghz and a rx580 8gb gpu , 16gb ddr3 and a Samsung evo Sata ssd runs classic beta maxed out and over 100fps.
---
I was going to upgrade but I don’t see the point. I don’t play anything else. 
---
When I look at core utilisation during game play only one core is loaded up (barely) and the other 3 cores have light loads.
---
My gpu also never gets anywhere near max temps or fan speeds.
---
Ram utilisation is super low too.
---
In fact battle.net launcher (based off chromium) is pretty much the most intensive thing going on lol.
---
if you're calling me a private server apologist, nothing can be further from the truth.  But to doubt the passion that they had for this game is foolish.  I'm pretty sure that instead of worry about worthless beta world firsts, they'd be testing the poop out of Classic.
---
If they report a bug that's not a bug, that's better than just putting on a show to legions of fans and not testing anything.
---
It's nothing but a publicity stunt by Blizzard right now.
---
Why? World pvp leads to the best interactions in pvp, just pure killing with tons of variety imo.
---
I think Fuzzy\_Jello must have played on a low pop or newer server. I played on Ner'zhul and killed I think 3 bosses in Naxx. My guild was not even close to pushing server firsts. By the time TBC came around it felt like everyone in Org had full tier 2. Keep in mind that in order to even start Naxx most of your raiders would be in a mix of tier 2/2.5.
---
Druid because OwO What’s This?
---
This only applies for bosses so the answer is no, things are still easy for any non-boss encounter.
---
Post a screenshot of /played on you main and your profile
---
this is your "WORK"?
---
Absolutely love your content man. I've recommended it to all my friends and can not get enough of it! Thanks for everything you do man!
---
I think you mean VC
---
Does anybody have an idea how long that will be ? A year ?
---
Though, it doesn’t appear that you presented any cons. 
---
OP was posting about his admiration for a game, in that game’s sub, yet your reply was that of childish sarcasm.
---
DAE UNPOPULAR OPINION, BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH, NOT A NATIVE SPEAKER
---
I miss leveling to 18-19 and then just stopping to see what the pvp scene was like. I didn’t feel like I needed to hit max level but instead just enjoy the content that part provided. 
---
Some of the best pvp times were had prior to level cap.
---
There’s a good comment in the post you linked regarding pvp rewards opening in phase 2 and bgs in phase 3 - people know what they’re doing now.  You’ll see people camping flight paths for anyone 48+ which is really going to piss off the player base since that’s the only form of pvp farming short of organizing events on the forums.  It would work better (the wait) if they skipped ahead and put the silithus and epl pvp events in phase 2.
---
The game requires layering to work.  It would be totally fuckedd without it.
---
While "experiencing the story again" is nice and all, let's be realistic, the vast majority of people would not be running ICC or whatever other dozens of raids every week on 10 alts for "the story" again and again. 
---
Also as mentioned below, as an RPer, I'm incredibly happy for transmog. Banks/bags are small enough as if, having to carry around at least one extra set of gear just to have something that fits your character, or saving rare drops incase you might want to use them, is pretty awful.
---
But, it doesn't have any place in Classic, definitely. But if they removed it from BfA, I'd be incredibly upset.
---
Instant wolf? Let me stop you right there. What?
---
It means your tank is going to be generating A LOT less threat than you are currently use to.  You will be behind/to the side of the vast majority of raid bosses in the game, so the parry shouldn't matter much to actual DPS.  The dodge will slightly matter though, not that a 1-2% difference is 'too' big.  
---
So I feel it isn't so much going to affect your current potential DPS on most encounters, but due to you needing to throttle yourself (or simply wait longer before attacking), it means your DPS will be lower.
---
Because they actually said the Vanilla data was overwritten at one point and could not be retrieved.
---
Everything started to go wrong after Ulduar--the type of content you want (expansion-wide progression) had certain mechanics in each stage of WoW designed to help speed it along. Vanilla inserted entire raids that served as catch-up (ZG). TBC instead opted for badges--daily activity eventually translated into T4-level items, which helped you actually finish T4, so you can get decked in T4, so that you can start T5. 2.4 introduced the first time a dungeon was used for catch-up mechanics, but since it also rewarded T4 level items IIRC and it was in the last breath of the expansion, it wasn't that bad.
---
WotLK broke every rule though. It introduced badges every content update (there were like 6 bloody different badge vendors) that gave you *current content* relevant items and they were way easier &amp; faster to get than Badge of Justice stuff. But it wasn't all that bad--it was just one vendor, then, okay, two vendors, still not THAT bad, when 3.1 hit.
---
But 3.2 introduced YET ANOTHER vendor and introduced fucking ToC which neutralized Ulduar as relevant content. Ulduar! One of the best raids ever! And suddenly every guild is like, huh, okay, I guess... there's no point in finishing Ulduar. Time to do TotC/TotGC (one of the *worst* raids ever) instead...
---
And then it continued, on and on. They introduced a way more horrifying version of Magister's Terrace (imagine if Magister's Terrace awarded you with Black Temple / Mount Hyjal gear), and then the very next patch, they did it *again* with the 3 new Icecrown dungeons. Then they continued doing this again and again, and in Cataclysm, completed the destruction of any semblance of expansion progression when they introduced LFR. They introduced LFR in order to 'restore' expansion progression, but it was just a cure for the problem they introduced in the first place when they decide to make previous patch content as irrelevant as previous expansion content.
---
They have enough people making incorrect [reports about NPC damage](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-hit-tables/185675/12) as is. You want them to add even more?
---
It is if you don't feed your pet lol
---
Twinks were an endgame in themselves. Had a 19 gnome rogue, I'm sorry... (not sorry).
---
That's what I remember, only end bosses of dungeons were actually kinda hard(with appropriate level group). 
---
Noobs who will encoutner van cleef or Arugal for the first time will still get murdered as intended
---
lol dude same
---
Woah dude, let's not jump to personal insults or insinuations!
---
Actually Classic is going OG mount system. Cheap training expensive mounts. So you get exalted with someone and get their training, Horse Riding for Stormwind for example. But the swift horse is 1000g before discounts
---
This is true. Burning Crusade really brought some amazing things to vanilla Azeroth.
---
I think they are arguing that Layering is a bad idea in general, and will be exploitable. Not that it is bug free
---
i am in the same spot...leaning priest because i hear shadow is good in pvp and good enough for 5 mans and there is always healing if i get bored
---
38-39 was my favorite I think. Idk why. I played warlock so I think people just didn’t know how to deal with fear effectively at that point lol
---
They aren't tanking mobs 20+ lvls higher though lol... link one example where they aren't getting hit for a massive amount of damage against enemies 15-20 levels higher. 
---
Blizzard already proved your line of thought wrong with their own examples.   1.12 damage values of most elites had been long since changed from the game's original values when it launched.
---
If you want to argue that they should stick to the launch values, then go right ahead... but the 1.12 are correct (so far) without a doubt.
---
Cata pre-patch, people spamming icelance and killing everyone in sight.
---
Thinly veiled cons
---
I'm still pretty confused on what this means for wep skill racials and if they are still super important, especially for tanking. I was planning on min-maxing gnome for pvp but tanking for pve.
---
Wrong.
---
FemDorf is spook level 9000
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZxZZRkM.jpg
---
Those parry thrashes
---
Those parry swing timer reductions too... I expect tanks to be harder to heal than in private servers as well.  1 in every 7 hits will cause most bosses to attack faster.
---
More like thinly veiled childishness.
---
Not a bad point. I still would not want people to look like they are in previous raid gear when they get all the way to nax upgrades. I just don't like the thought of seeing the best-designed armor everywhere. Its really impossible to recognize gear equipped on sight if everyone gets to choose their appearance. To me seeing the people above me in the same sets really adds to the experience.
---
Here's how RFC remains relevant: 
---
* I walk amongst people in the city to whom it is relevant. We share a common world. 
---
* They might ask me for tips. If I like them I might even run them through it. 
---
* The drops they get from RFC will be on the auction house. If I'm leveling an alt I might buy something they acquired there. 
---
* RFC is in the same world that I'm in so, if PvP erupts, it might happen there outside the entrance. I might rush there to participate.
---
MTs didn't even used to be prot spec! My best mate IRL was much less geared than the guild MT/OT, so he specced prot. He was in about 50% epic, 50% blues in a BWL raid when the MT/OT went down. He managed to tank Broodlord Lashlayer for the remainder of the fight for our guild first kill.
---
Have you tanked raids and how have you found it?
---
It does make a difference, but the way most raid gear works out kind of means you are actually floating extra hit in the end, or a piece you can use instead wont really be 'that' much better. 
---
All it really means is that you will have a better start in tier 1 raiding when using a sword.
---
Twill Set
---
Maraudon
---
Yeah, fair, single characters isn't for everyone! 😃
---
Crafting mid-range bags for people levelling. 12 and 14 slot bags are popular on the AH, but unlike other auctionable materials, bags are actually bought and used by people levelling their first character, and more importantly they're *affordable* at a decent sales price for players coming through on a fresh server.
---
Or you all just sucked at the game.
---
Silk shirt no pants
---
OMG I totally forgot about this trinket and the second I seen the image I even remember where to grab it lol.
---
They have access....
---
Kind of a stupid question as fun is subjective. Class fantasy also plays into the "fun" even if the class is rather boring to level(pally). Play whatever you feel like playing.
---
And end bosses. They were the only real threat
---
That staff is insane unless you get a better drop in DM, even then the spirit cuts so much downtime in leveling that it may be better.
---
&gt;Don't have layers" 
---
gr8 plan.   Then 1 mo post launch every server is low pop to dead.
---
There is software that does the heavy lifting but I made the images
---
Just hit it REALLY hard
---
I agree with your sentiment, but I am not really sure I agree that TBC fell into the category of artificial feeling.  
---
Perhaps it is just my own personal bias talking, but it never felt like a chore to quest or rep grind in outlands, and it even had a lot of side content to experience and partake in that wasn't 'forced' on us like it started being in lich king.
---
The only time it ever felt like an artificial push in TBC was near the end when sunwell released along with that island with dailies you basically had to do.  As for the other 3/4 of the expansion, I felt the world was a similar vibe to vanilla in regards to a feeling of freedom.
---
He also hired much of the team who made the original game. Probably one of the most important figures in the creation of WoW and in the decision to make Classic. Shame that the media has the power it does over the public's minds and moods.
---
No. Get out of here with that Alliance shit.
---
I'd assume there's a legion of "NO CHANGE" people out there who want this still in the game despite how shitty this mechanic is overall.
---
What I've always found so cool about WoW is that these voices are the last kinds of voices I would expect to come out of a WoW player, much less a gamer.
---
The cast bar addons that already exist in the beta (and also existed back in actual vanilla) aren't either.
---
Yeah I’m in the same boat. Really struggling during this wait
---
The only reason naxx guilds kept raiding MC/BWL were for legendary weapons.  No point in over glorifying that in my mind.  
---
The reason naxx40 guilds required people to raid 6~ days a week for 4-5 hours a day was because they felt compelled to always fit in the chance for certain people to get that shiny orange.  And by compelled.. I mean countless warrior DPS, rogues and tanks whining non stop.
---
Yep.  Looks like it's from Asmongold's stream earlier, where he took a pack of 1's (who became 2's through exploration XP) up there to try to take on the Horde.  The servers screamed in protest the whole way, and attacking a Murloc on the shore (as they're doing here) just made it worse, with people teleporting all over as lag went nuts (they straight up killed the server two or three times).
---
The saddest thing is, they weren't able to do the low-level PVP battle in the area they wanted because they had too many people.  Layering kicked in, and the Horde ended up on another layer, so the Horde's army ran right past the Alliance's army, without showing up on each other's screens.
---
Quick question about that. What is the harm in clogging bags? If you are going out in the world for an RP session, creating a gear swap macro seems like it would be pretty easy. I always seem to have excess bag space. Doesnt retreaving gear and meticulously keeping track of it in the bank fit the RP environment more? I remember when I tried RPing a while back people didnt like it when you whisper and would mail each other instead. Seems like the hardcore would prefer the old way. Maybe I am way off with that, so that is why I am asking.

There used to be a hill in azshara where the portals would have been:  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azshara\_Crater](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azshara_Crater)

It's where the strip mine is now.
---
You can’t use it in BG’s to trap right after, or in PVE instances to drop threat. It simply doesn’t work in anything besides the open world, and even then it’s buggy and doesn’t work half the time

Hi, /u/ardmore, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Hey my dude, group of friends and I will be playing classic and be making a small guild with some friends. We play some League/HoTs and chat on our discord. I took a look through your profile and noticed a few similar interests, DM me and we can talk a bit and I can send you an invite to our discord if interested :)
---
I'm absolutely awful with math. I get the idea that itemization will change a bit due to this information, but can someone explain how this will significantly effect the raiding experience compared to private servers?
---
I get that the parry chance % is a significant difference and that the dodge % is notable, but I really don't see how that would translate in to harder bosses when we're talking bosses that die in less than a minute anyway...
---
I'm with you on that!
---
As an RPG player, transmog is a horrible concept.
---
And a fish in the offhand.
---
&gt; I like tanking
---
&gt; Druid
---
Ha.
---
[Humar the Pridelord](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=5828/humar-the-pridelord). 
---
I camped that lion for HOURS as a 23 hunter. I wanted him for 29 BGs. We wrecked face and he looked badass.
---
Suddenly avoidance tanking becomes more important... (just like we used to say back in vanilla, hehehe)
---
Not even close lol. Besides, what's the point of a MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER Online RPG if there aren't huge masses of players "living" in a massive world? Fighting, trading, invading, dicking around...
---
Yeah...I remember in vanilla feeling the same way. Transmog is, like the above commenter said, a way to make old content relevant. Since there’s no old content, well....no need or want for transmog! I like it on retail because a lot of the “current” gear just isn’t my style, or because I have challenge weapon appearances I want to show off and I need a gear set to match it. And nobody inspects you on retail, they just ask your ilvl  anyways. I like retail for what it is and I don’t want Classic to become like it because I like it for what it is, too.
---
I enjoyed Mercenary Tao and General Blue, but it just felt like all the other officers were just fodder. Though, I can't say I particularly enjoyed the Penguin Village part either, hahaha
---
I loved playing rogue in vanilla... my druid friend and I could stealth take down a couple bosses in UBRS without killing more than a few mobs by ourselves for farming.
---
Unique stuff like that made it great.
---
Not the best representation.  You can get into the stress test without paying anything, and a lot of people are taking advantage of that.  I'd bet a lot of them aren't even main accounts, or are people who don't normally play and just wanted to join in the stream shenanigans.  I'm glad it's not representative of how the game will be when it launches, because aside from this server-crushing mass, I remember watching Asmongold (and Esfand, I think?) trying to level and unable to because there was a small horde of people following him everywhere, spamming him, and tagging mobs before they could.  I know his chat can get pretty awful at times, but I didn't expect so many people to go into the game with the sole intention of straight up sabotaging him so hardcore.
---
I'll be eager to see what a real SS-TM battle looks like on the live servers, especially once layering dies down.  Probably will be closer to what the proper beta stuff's been like at times with the players setting up battles in that area.  And also how the main cities look when it's been live for a month (I say a month to give time for people to have leveled up and have more reasons to come back to town to look for groups or hit up the AH).
---
I can't remember if they had them in vanilla, but during the lunar festival they have really nice pant suits that I use on my bank alts.
---
They are in classicDB but im not sure if thats for sure that they exist back then. Its what I'm gonna aim for: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=21542#comments
---
There were a bunch of colors.
---
Finally, something that makes the game HARDER. 
---
We need more things like this!
---
Ouch - well this is the point of the stress tests I guess.
---
Even worse. I'm missing a key.
---
Wow. This really helps explain why my (very limited) experience tanking in vanilla was so drastically different from what the pserver crowd was saying a couple months ago.
---
Time to re-think our tanking strats? Maybe some of those old school tanks can actually help us out after all.
---
Sureeee , when the poster posted controversial 'overselling' nonsense where there is no 'overselling' of WOW classic here except for people wanting to replay classic even after knowing the limitations and annoyance of classic WOW.
---
and you worked overtime to defend the OP because you obviously dont like people happy being able to play classic wow again .. which beg a question why are you here if you do not like classic and do not like people who love classic ?
---
Druids are insane in the first three due to the of lack of mounts.
---
Yup BC absolutley was better class design than vanilla. In almost every single way. More specs can raid, made some classes more viable in pvp...also made some specs strait up broken lol (SL/SL, resto arena comps
---
Shadow priests can tribute run as well
---
The boss showed that the numbers were correct. 
---
Deductive reasoning would say that if the numbers they plugged into one boss are correct, then the rest should be too. Considering the reference client is what the numbers are being obtained from.
---
I agree 100%.  Having the music on all the time becomes background noise and detract from the impact it can have.
---
premades dont want to face eachother because its less honor per hour. pub stomp to T14
---
I know that I'm just talking about the combat formulas
---
Why are casuals the most important ? Blizzard literally said Classic is about recreation the game as it was then and thr population doesnt matter.
---
Lol weabooos aren't Japanese and they know jackshit about Japan they just gawk over anything from that general region
---
If you want to be technical skull or bosses are just considered to be 3 levels higher than the attacking player. 
---
People figured this out on accident when fighting vanilla bosses in tbc/wrath.
---
I mean - people are playing the new season when it comes out - I’ve put probably 60-80 hours in between PC and switch in the past two weeks.  Just because you aren’t playing it doesn’t mean nobody is.  I personally really enjoy the endless scaling and loot grind - it feels great to be in the top 200 Crusaders on PC after grinding the gear and learning a new build.
---
is this really your work ? because i see similar artwork done by other people before
---
Reddit should have a minimum age requirement to post
---
That's funny.  I just remembered my old guildy who was an old time vet, and had to play with the sound off because the gun noises triggered his PTSD.
---
Night Elf hunter can stealth and gank people easy
---
Hey Kala would you recommend Undead over Troll Spriest? 
---
Obviously people should play what they want, but I'm more looking at the Shadowguard vs Devouring Plague comparison.
---
It was my understanding that Shadowguard was pretty helpful against the Rogue and Warrior matchup, but Devouring Plague is pretty damn good as well, albiet less spammable and a costs a ton of Mana.
---
That's a good rebuttal kiddo.
---
Prove it then.
---
Depends on when you hit 60 compared to the rest of the server and if you are in it for the long haul. If you are one of the first skinner to max lvl you can stock up on devilsaur undisputed for a few days/week before anyone else can compete for it. A few weeks/ months later and you are selling them left and right for the big bucks.
---
What he meant is I'm ok with zero kills as long as I also have zero deaths and I want the stamina leather.
---
Neked
---
My rebuttal is everything I posted before you showed up and said "nu-uh"
---
Lol what??
---
And if you were a troll using a bow, or a dwarf using a gun, it was 3% lower. Not to mention, ranged missiles get calculated differently. The lower TPS output this info equates to, means that Hunters will be able to go ham before other classes and will therefore see themselves higher on the dps list.
---
use your hearthstone ?
---
You can be passionate about something and still be wrong.
---
&gt; I'm replying to someone that is saying that if blizzard just released classic in the same state it was, it would be **perfect**
---
False

&gt; They **have** to create a system to alleviate the same problems they had 10+ years ago.

You forgot the option for neither. I don’t want anything after classic.

---
We are a brand new guild with a lot of raid experience all the way back to WoW classic back in '04/'05 up to and including Naxx40. All slots are currently available and we look forward to seeing you help us grow into one of the top guilds on our selected server.
---
🔷 💢 **Raid information** 💢 🔷
---
Schedule: Tuesday and Thursday 20:15-00:15 CST (Primary Raid Days)
---
Sunday 20:15-0015 CST (Optional Events, 20-mans)
---
Loot system: Our loot system will be determined utilizing the opinions of all members when we get closer to that time. We want to use a system that is both fair but also doesn't discourage minor upgrades in favor of "hording" points for that one item everyone really wants. We're leaning towards a decaying DKP system but want to make sure it's a good fit.
---
🔷 💢 **What you can expect from our team** 💢 🔷
---
We are a mature group with a lot of history in the game. We intend to progress consistently and quickly without requiring anyone to sink endless hours into raiding. Content will be done in a timely manner. Other than that, play and have a good time. We are a brand new guild so most raid slots are available.
---
🔷 💢 **What we expect from you** 💢 🔷
---
We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.
---
🔷 💢 **How to join** 💢 🔷
---
Please follow the link below to join our Discord where you will be presented with a link to our brief application. Once that's completed, you will be contacted by an officer.

Damn, that's rough. : /
---
I love all the downvotes when I just want clarification. Don't Brigade against those familiar with the private server scene, private servers brought us Classic WoW.
---
If you are wondering if people are still constantly getting world server down. The answer is yes.
---
Hell yea, we fought well I think, must've been a little embarrasing for them :)
---
Leveled from 1-10 with only one disconnect in Tirisfal.
---
god damnit. That's annoying. Thanks for the info though
---
It was a fucking joke
---
Nah I say this just makes your alts more meaningful, so not really that unfriendly.
---
I was in a fantastic guild way back in vanilla, Archon (alliance side).  The nostalgia is strong.  I'm returning for classic.
---
Everyone go register at vanillafriends so we can find each other :)
---
I’ve never had fun at the bottom of the meters man
---
Yeah they're so cool about it having a blast. I game with a few Vietnam veterans and their just like that
---
This is great
---
You're assuming I don't enjoy any aspect of classic, why? That's a pretty bold assumption, just because I see a game for its flaws as well as the good things, automatically makes me dislike the game and not love it? If I were you, I'd take a step back and actually read some of what's on this board and then retort because I can assure you there's overselling, you just don't seem to want to see it.
---
You will make friends. You are almost better off tbh
---
Thanks so much for listening and for telling your friends mate, I really appreciate it, word of mouth helps a lot :)
---
Is that a thing that has happened?
---
Because i play with friends, and ive always been the support player. And ive mained paladin more than half my life. 
---
You cry about paladins boring leveling and brokenness, But you are gonna play a warlock? 
---
Have fun being a decurse bitch for mages. And if you say you are going to PVP not PVE - we all know you have no clue how vanilla works. 
---
Anyway i Will be duo leveling with a friend warrrior, so even more broken. Have you seen sweeping strikes+cleave with no down time to eat for warriors. Fun times ahead. See you in Classic :)
---
Mages are super fun (other than raiding)
---
&lt;3
---
Laughs in Paladin.
---
How about posts with a 'meme', that's just a low-effort edit they made. One image you put together in ten seconds isn't a fucking 'meme'.
---
How am I trying to "eat his ass"? lmao. I'm trollin him you mongoloid. Some ppl are seriously brain dead.
---
Hunters are strong in all. More balanced at 60 though.
---
I have had zero issues with quests in start zones

Yes. And so do Worgen! And Blood Elves have a spin.

Retail's got one advantage, at least.

Some minor exploits for phase 1 vs basically killing the game
---
It's not hard to figure out which option is better.
---
Here, let me get the crayons out, and help you some more.  When classic launches, damn near everyone currently playing wow, and toms of others will make an account.  We are talking upwards of a few million people.  Most of those people won't be active players though.   Maybe 10% will stick around, if that.  
---
If a server pop is 3000, and only 10% of players stick around, then there will only be 300 active players on a full server shortly after release.  Every server would be low pop to dead, which means people couldn't get groups, which means it would drive even more people away.   Blizz would then have to combine servers, which a lot of ppl don't want.  
---
This is why blizzz is using layering.  They know that there will be a mass exodus of players, so they're preparing for it ahead of time.  
---
A child could figure out something so simple.  A dumb one.
---
meanwhile ret paladins have no snares, interrupts or movement abilities
---
thx esfand, mcconnell, and quinn
---
I've always wanted to go there :O
---
I love the unfriendliness because I make alts constantly and it's shit that later versions people didn't have to work to level to get to cap. Glad to enjoy the experience and take it slowly
---
if your melee DPS is dumb and front-dpses, that is.
---
We already knew the boss was (probably) correct since it matched private server values. The issue is specifically about elite mobs in dungeons. Even elite mobs in the world seemed to match private servers, but not the dungeon elites.
---
Blizzard can have bugs you know. They aren't perfect just because they have the data.
---
25/12/2006, 22 days before tbc heh. Always wondered when I actually started playing, thanks for the link!
---
Hey dude! You will find friends when playing. I met two great people three days ago when leveling on an inofficial server. We've been questing every day since, joined the same guild etc. As long as you're friendly and open to new people I guarantee you you will make plenty of friends in Classic. Almost difficult not to.
---
I remember first logging in the day before I turned 19 in 2006.
---
If you put 4 mages in the same group the aura makes it almost worth it.  
---
We also had an oomkin for the aura in our guild.
---
What makes NE's so special?
---
Bug reporting intensifies.
---
I get that this is beta but does anyone actually believe that this will get fixed by launch? I dont.
---
Druids are only insane at 39 since they get travel form at 30. Best FCs throughout though.
---
Horde was ruined by having pretty elves flouncing around Orgrimmar. We're the ugly faction, not the barbie faction.
---
&gt; vs basically killing the game
---
Utterly retarded premise. Didn't kill it at original launch, nor on private servers. Reality is calling.
---
My first character was a human warrior, but I switched to and stuck with an undead rogue after hitting 60. My current plan is to play a warrior again.
---
&gt; Almost everything involved in a hunter's skill ceiling can be managed with macros and addons, including dead zone, max range and autoshot time. It's easy as hell to play at a competent level.
---
Can you elaborate? Not that I don't believe the concept, but outside of fd+trap macros I'm not seeing a lot. Definitely not so much as to trivialize their challenge. 
---
Taking [this guy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7B24r8J6ZZs) for instance, who seems incredibly good, I'm not seeing much automated stuff
---
Why only level 60 content? Why not other level brackets as well?
---
I'd rather see TBC and beyond than see ilvl creep ruin Classic.
---
Ah ok, i will try to find that for you if you still need it.
---
It feels like it because thats what it is. The thing i despise the most about retail is that the previous raidtier and all the gear you gathered up until the new patch becomes completely irrelevant.
---
Their logic behind it is that players shouldnt fall behind and always be on the same starting ground when a new raid tier is released.
---
In other words, it should benefit slower players. But in my opinion it does just the opposite. If i dont manage to kill certain raid bosses before a patch it means i will never be able to experience those bosses the way they should be experienced. In vanilla its possible for a slower guild to still get to clear all the content "legitimately" even after new content has been released.
---
I wonder if it's an error with &lt; vs &lt;=
---
if they are rolling vs 1000, and do a check (80 &lt; 80) instead of (80 &lt;= 80) then the miss error would be .1%
---
Hey, it's a theory.
---
In general, a single endgame and a desire for balance will lead to homogenized garbage.
---
Man I’m glad I’m not the only one. I’ve always felt this way and was one of the major turnoffs for me in retail. I could never get into the game because the numbers were just outrageous
---
Yeah I’m not sure what your going on about. I had Addons that showed me my targets numerical health and mana bars/ spell casts as well as my target of targets numerical health/mana bars +cast bar. Bluffing casts was a real thing you did in classic to bait out someone counter-spell, kick, silence or what have you.
---
I always though they should have done something like item level capping on old raids, especially after they made that technology for timed dungeons and arena. That way you wouldn't have people running in soloing old gods.
---
&gt; Here, let me get the crayons out, and help you some more. When classic launches, damn near everyone currently playing wow, and toms of others will make an account. We are talking upwards of a few million people. Most of those people won't be active players though. Maybe 10% will stick around, if that.

Lower chance to miss = easier.
---
Blizzard should make the soundtrack run full duration before changing based on area. Its terrible when you change zone constantly and the music keep getting interupt by another soundtrack.
---
I guess one could pretend they are mounting their pet? Grats on the hard work tho
---
It will be discovered eventually.
---
Blizzard have said a lot of things in the past that were either bollocks or they've changed their mind about. From what I remember that explanation was from their "Vanilla WoW servers will never happen" stance.
---
That explanation in the context of software development doesn't really make a lot of sense. The server would have been overwritten but the actual install setup would have been backed up.
---
Its because people love being confrontational.
---
Always assuming that the "others" purposefully want to ruin things. I bet Valv90 is really negative towards Blizzard and automatically assume that this kind of layering is what they want for Classic launch.
---
\*sends pets\*

This issue seems like it would be quite easy to fix.
---
All these players are in the same layer, they should not have to be moved to a different layer when joining together in a group.
---
well if there is one thing I have never heard, it is players complaining about too many druids in WSG :D
---
That's a good boi. The dog too.
---
Oh damn you landed there!
---
Does that trainer in moonglade give rep discounts?
---
The dragon just lost aggro (horde was actively avoiding it). Mobs that are leashed far enough despawn instead of running back.
---
"Stolen"
---
Brah, this is the internet. Everything is both stolen and free
---
Ad infinitum until you are a God basically? There are caps to what a single person can do, that is/was one of the main points to vanilla WoW.  You should never get to the point where you can solo a raid boss. 
---
You are not talking about immersion, you are talking about rewards. I agree there should be rewards, but power creep needs to stop. How about content that challenges your skill, the reward to your character is partly honing your own skill and getting better at playing with the gear you have?
---
You dont understand what actual roleplaying and immersion are.  If we went with your idea in a LOTR setting a single person could eventually kill Sauron due to power creep, that is t immersion, that is a power fantasy to the zillionth degree.
---
Right. So what are you talking about? You said instant wolf, I said what you said, you act like I'm dumb.
---
I’m not saying that, as I’ve said in other threads, I don’t think the numbers are the issue. I think it’s the way the numbers are being applied that can be at fault, especially since the numbers are being punched into a system with different means of computing damage and mitigation compared to how it was computed at launch.
---
Mortal strike takes up one of the vital 16 slot capped debuffs with a debuff that doesn't actually effect the boss. This insanely limits their damage if not used, or limits the raids damage (eg: take up sunder armors spot)
---
This is **massive** in terms of TPS reduction... 3 times the parries? And more dodges? That will have a serious effect on threat for tanks, which in turn lowers the dps of every single threat capped dps in the game too. So Warlocks and Fury warriors are going to probably decrease some here as well as they are threat capped at end game IIRC.
---
Wow...
---
Nice, I've made it to level 6 in Teldrassil with about 50 disconnects. Kill a mob and d/c. Walk to the next mob and d/c. Say something in General and d/c. I'm glad this is happening on a stress test so they can fix it for launch.
---
are you sure the human is willing to share the computer with you?
---
Depends on how hard bosses hit compared to pservers though. We know that pservers are overtuned for lower level content, and that the armor on practically every boss is overtuned as well (at least for the bigger one out there).
---
Some bosses are still likely to eat tanks up because of a bad streak of parries though. Chromaggus comes to mind.
---
Yep. Just got disconnect to world server down error again.
---
I'm not fond of transmog, but it's for different reasons. I love the idea of a wardrobe system. I love that my paladin can always look like a paladin. I played on an RP realm where people got really creative with their transmog sets. For the most part, everybody wanted to look like their class. It was pretty cool. I also don't see a problem with people running old content and being out and about in the world instead of just queueing for current content from a faction capitol.
---
It had a tangible impact on the economy, though, and I'll be glad to not see that in Classic.
---
For heirlooms, I have a love/hate relationship with them. As a chronic altoholic I liked that I could speed up the slog through content I've already done countless times. But on the other hand they were overpowered. I think they should have gone with "blue-quality gear that levels with you" OR an XP bonus while at green quality. Not both, that's for sure.
---
It's so weird when people talk about how hard it is to solo elite quests when like... There's no reason to need to do that. The ability to group up with other players is the reason why the mobs are elites in the first place.
---
Ye
---
I'll check it out tonight and post results, I just wanted to know if anyone else had done it already.
---
I think we all knew and accepted Private Servers got things wrong, but being off by 300% is pretty alarming. Straight up getting parried 3x more than normal is going to have some serious ramifications on threat per second. Gonna be a lotta dead Fury Warriors and Warlocks from Private Servers man.
---
That's why you up the general leveling difficulty, huge mistake to make leveling too facerolly.  I know it sounds counter intuitive, because you're slowing it down, but you'll keep more subs this way, way more.
---
If you read some more classic Reddit, you'll find m8xx can be pretty fuckin retarded
---
it's just alpha guys wait for the beta, it's just beta guys wait for the game to release, it's just patch 1.12 wait for next patch.
---
Part of the reason transmog worked on retail is that ever since Blizz made enemy health viewable without an addon, on the target frame, people started sizing one-another up more by max health than by shoulder shape or how cool the gear looked.
---
That obviously doesn't fly in vanilla, where you can't see enemy health, and you need other visual cues to size up an enemy.
---
I like to level characters sometimes. I got all the heirlooms when they came out, most aren't even upgraded past 60, though. I used them a little, but stopped. It ruins the leveling experience. I enjoy leveling. Heirlooms remove all of the fun of that. You don't care about quest gear upgrades. You don't care about dungeon loot. It's all just worthless because you have the best gear possible already.
---
Sure, if you were speed leveling a character to be a new main or something it would be useful, but you could also just buy a character boost if it's that important to you.
---
I always loved TB, I didn't like how under utilized it was.  Only when events took place you would see folks Darkmoon faire and such
---
lol@the swoop
---
I played a R druid in vanilla. My best advice would be to make friends with a dps that has a res. Ret pally, shaman, priest, etc. It is really unfortunate if the only res your group has is your battle res.
---
That's only for spells.
---
"In English doc"
---
Would you vendor the mats from enchanting or put em on the AH
---
how so? Just because they spawned and "trolled" some streamers doesn't separate them from retail devs.
---
I relentlessly judged every other Rogue I saw. Other than that I only really inspected people who were exceptionally good or bad at their job.
---
Rogues Take Zero Skill
---
There's screenshots from 2006 of people missing with 8% hit from items. I assume the hit formula was changed at some point during Vanilla.
---
When people say "ewww I can't play it if it doesn't have X feature or Y graphics" I just think they are wanting to play for the wrong reasons. If classic did have transmog, they still wouldn't enjoy it. Their minds are already made up, transmog was just the thing they chose to blame it on.
---
Hey Bone! Long time no see. I hope you are doing good.
---
Also playing NA West. I’ll be a Tauren Druid no-lifing it for 2 weeks once classic launches. What faction and class will you be?
---
Getting disconnected every 5 minutes...
---
Good Hunters will wreck you.
---
Agro management is something DPS players haven't had to worry about since TBC. Just takes 1 person out of 40 to accidently pull and cause a couple deaths after taunt is resisted. Makes certain specs like Spriests less viable.
---
Main tank healing will be considerably more difficult due to burst damage than I think you give it credit for.
---
It's pretty sad knowing you can probably make Retail extremely good and exponentially increase profit and sustainability  by REMOVING things instead of having to add them.  What a shitshow.
---
Reckoning , yeah no 
---
Casters , yeah no
---
And what exactly do they want their gear to be transmogged into?  
---
There are no previous expansions and if you have good looking gear you are most likely wearing it anyways because that's your best gear as well.
---
I will finish my current guide and then work on human and elf :)
---
Wow, personal attacks, pretty nice!
---
This is a great test! Nice job!
---
😂
---
Bold move for a Dwarf. Probably doesn’t get bothered because he’s got Fear Ward.
---
haha this has to be a troll comment
---
what's no about reckoning?
---
possible
---
*indescribable grumbling noises*
---
The vocal minority call deadmines vc.  Deadmines was dm first before dire maul existed, get over it. If what was established could be changed so easily this conversation wouldnt come up as often as it does.  Use dme dmw dmn like a normal person.
---
Why? You don't have crusader aura in classic?
---
I feel the same way, just learning about this scaling for the first time. 
---
Quit wow towards the end of BC. BC and Vanilla were the best ever and I heard WOTLK was probably very good as well or at least the majority of it. All the changes I hear about make absolutely no sense.
---
Vanilla solved all the problems the new expansions (I guess from MoP or WoD until current bfa) created.
---
or just lag?
---
Because Blizzard has always cared about the casuals, WoW was created for them.  They make up the majority of every game and Blizzard is selling a product.  They absolutely care about the population, and will be watching it like a hawk regardless of what they said while deciding whatever product Blizzard thinks they can sell next after Classic, seasonal, TBC, etc. whatever keeps casuals subscribing.
---
Thinking Blizzard made Classic for any reason but profits is just insane.
---
ahah yeah, people saying that 250ms is literally unplayable when in fact its managable as fuck... maybe thats becuase we played on it for so long though lol
---
What your saying is that keybind both my accounts to the same keys so that they're functioning basically the same, is not permitted. Is the best permitted way to set up duel monitors and spend time switching from character to character?
---
Most of them are going to be streaming launch as well since that will bring in a lot of viewers. So it won't really be that hard to find out where the streamers are going to end up.
---
I'm talking about ESO, using examples that wow people would understand
---
Dude, boars only grants 2 experience points a piece. Do you know how many you would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
---
I know a ton of shadow priests that would argue they  are probably top tier for 1v1. especially with engineering.
---
You're saying I could use a program to bind the same keys to each character, so I wouldnt have to switch from screen to screen?
---
Because of how range calculations work, did you not look at the bluepost formula?
---
Yes, we have done things in the past that isn’t in line with mother natures best. And we are not proud of that. 
---
To get the tauren to forgive us, we’ve started the planning process for a giant waterpark in Mulgure next to Thunderbluff. We will put the shovels to the ground 2020, it will be finished around 2074.
---
That looks like lag to me.
---
Keyboard turning warrior with the most broken item ever made.  Good times.
---
He has received.
---
books are for losers.
---
Interesting... never thought about it, but feeling completely the same lol. 
---
I never played Alliance, but if for some reason I have to, only option is Dwarf. They rock. Not as much as any Horde Race, but acceptable. :)
---
Dwarves are greedy. Dig holes and shit to find gold. Dwarves are ugly. Kill them but don't eat them.
---
Overwatch and BFA (or anything past LK) beta come to mind in regards to Blizzard. They were just early-access
---
Hunters are OP in 49 bracket. I remember aim shot critting for 1k and then throwing out a multi shot for assorted values between 1-1.5k. That’s enough to down most classes.
---
Roll a female gnome rogue on an rp server and macro pickpocket to have you say "Lighten your pockets gov'na?"
---
Layering was *literally implemented to solve this issue.* Have you not read or just don’t understand what they said it is for? They having different layers of the *same server* for launch so that we can actually play the same. You can only interact with people on the *same server*, not on others. And when populations fall enough or people aren’t all crammed into the first few zones, then the layers for the *same server* will be fully merged together and you will still be with the same people on your server.
---
Problem with the resist set stacking is to get it high enough to really make an impact (200+ resistance) you gimp the rest of your stats, so much that any caster can just switch to their other school any wreck you.
---
Rogues with stealth and insta kill all the way to 60
---
That’s what you get for trying to level a warrior in vanilla
---
Hi, /u/redsoxVT, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
If you could, I’d deeply appreciate it!
---
I’ve been search on and off for hours, for the past few days. I know there must be an archive of .PNG classic WoW UI elements, somewhere.
---
Excellent news!
---
Itemization situation can be solved by simply cloning existing quest rewards etc from similar content elsewhere but giving it a different skin.
---
I would like to see a lot of the stuff that was scrapped, some day. I'd like to see other areas accessible and fleshed out, like top thunder falls could have some quests or something.
---
I don't want to see any content that surpasses Naxx, and would prefer to see the focus on a little more something for everyone. Events, BGs, dungeons and quest hubs for level brackets that could use a little more content, etc. Any new level 60 content I would hope would vary between existing end-game ilvl brackets. Maybe some tier sets that beef up odd specs a little via set bonuses and stat priority. Have encounters that benefit from having a few odd specs in the raid as well.
---
LOL I just actually followed your link and put the context together. 
---
You think Enhancement Shamans in Classic are going to have Instant Ghost Wolf LMFAO
---
Am I sure that I played Vanilla? Holy shit this sub is funny af
---
I know the feeling.  I was involved in serious attempts, but a new job put an end to my vanilla raiding career.
---
I have the exact same problem brudder
---
I never raided in Vanilla, so forgive me if I'm completely off-base here!.
---
But couldn't new horizontal content be designed to maximise player creativity and strategy? Raids in Vanilla seem to be about min-maxing based on damage and resistances, and progressing through to ensure the right gear to survive and hit hard.
---
Horizontal content could be designed so that new raids and dungeons have gear requirements and tactics that emphasise different stats &amp; strategies that aren't feasible for existing content. So instead of having guilds abandon old gear in order to hit the next dungeon, they'd be swapping tactics and mixing gear of the same level but with different stat distribution. 
---
I'd also enjoy more creative level design in any horizontal/new content. Bosses that require specific placement to avoid damage and gain environmental buffs, different raid class proportions, etc. Surely there's a way to design this that doesn't involve power creep, but still provides significant challenge to players to figure out the right way to beat?
---
Not saying you're dumb. But you obviously don't know the subject.
---
Ghost wolf has a 2 seconds cast time. 21 points in restau allows you to reach Nature's Swiftness, which turns any Nature spell that has a cast time under 10 seconds into an instant cast.
---
What this means is that in WSG, having the ability to cast instantly your wolf form every two minutes gives you an insane advantage as a flag carrier.
---
It's been the same in Durotar for some hours now.
---
completing that chain quest that rewards a blue for going into a dungeon.
---
Melee range in a cloth wearer when a boss cleaves.
---
Hmm. Nope. Nothing bad could happen there.
---
Because people are playing a game, the vast majority prefer convenience over excessive realism. The end result is the same, but one saves you bag space. Most people would prefer the one that saves you bag space.
---
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
---
&gt; Parry on raid bosses is huge because it also means the next attack comes 50% faster
---
40% I think
---
This is true, some of my best raiders got in the beta and just stopped playing. They sent me messages basically saying classic is more fun not coming back sorry.
---
29 too if you take feline swiftness
---
For shaman wouldnt flame shock be better to prevent vanish or restealth? You can use earthbind to get some distance... maybe ghost wolf and escape?
---
What race/zone?
---
I did too, I sit in Goldshire and tell everyone sharding in and out of existence how excited I am for classic.
---
...an insane advantage as a flag carrier...over a Druid? So you're a really good alternate flag carrier if a Druid and Frost Mage are nowhere to be found? 
---
Top 10 PvP spec no doubt
---
I think I'd put vanilla up there with BC (and maybe MoP; never played it), but other than that, I largely agree with what you've asserted here. Makes me wish that WotLK and Cata hadn't killed the game before MoP came out; you've made me curious about it.
---
Hi, great video, but honestly not all info is totally correct. Let me explain.  
---
1. Mind flay tooltip DPS/DPM is ok, but in reality Mind flay is really bad if you compare it to wand dmg. Some MF ranks are even worse than a decent wand. Thats why mind flay is bad. Sometimes its just better to spam wand to get more dmg. Moreover, wand dmg cost no mana. Just compare Gravestone scepter dps to a concurrent rank of mind flay, and you'll get what im saying. So basically you dont want to use MF if you have a decent wand. Thre is a break point when MF is becoming great: its lvl 44, when you get rank4.
---
2. 5\\5 shadow focus is an overkill. Your hit chance against +2 lvl mobs is 94%, so you basically need just 2\\5 shadow focus to get to hit cap. All other points will be just a waste.
---
3. Using power word shield in your rotation is not mana effecient. You should use it only when absolutely necessary.  Concurrent heal rank is just twice mana effecient.
---
4. Best opener for a priest is Holy FIre, since it benefits from 5-sr, while u cast 3,5s cast  you rege 1-2 ticks of mana regen, which makes Holy Fire the best mana effective opener for a priest. 
---
5. Pre 40 rotation should be something like Holy Fire &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SWP &gt; Inner Fire &gt; Wand, when low on HP you should change for Holy Fire &gt; Heal &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SWP &gt; Inner Fire &gt; Wand.
---

---
Same argument can be made with Balance DPS. Bring your alternative stat stick/speed consumable melee thingy, burn your mana on max DPS casting then shift to feral and scratch the boss until your mana comes back :P
---
“I should focus on the things that make me happy and World of Warcraft is it.”
---
You make a really good point here. I often see people posting on here, giving good advice about not letting the game take over your life, but at the same time it’s interesting that by giving your all into this game you can actually get that back. For some people like yourself I suppose that you readreally do find happiness and meaning in this game, and in return, that happiness and meaning follows you into your life. 
---
Of course I will caution by saying that you shouldn’t put all of your eggs in one basket and only be able to find happiness from one source such as World of Warcraft. At the same time, the fact that you’re finding meaning and happiness in your life, even if it’s just from a video game, is beautiful. 
---
Who’s to say that the meaning and happiness that you find within this game isn’t real? 
---
At the end of the day I feel that happiness and self fulfillment is a personal journey. You can read all the self-help books in the world and try all sorts of things to find happiness in the world around you but if you found what makes you happy,and that’s this video game, then fuck everything else
---
Devouring Plague is also good in those matchups, but of course it’s useless against Dwarves. Troll have the advantage over Undead in some matchups, and Undead have the advantage over Troll in others.
---
End of the day, pick whichever you like better :)
---
Warriors did bat shit insane damage late in vanilla. Private servers might not have them doing the correct damage, but they will still be top dps in classic.
---
So the soft-cap is 308, not 310.
---
If this is true, that means BiS for Dagger Rogue is not:
---
8/9 T3 + ACLG
---
but this:
---
9/9 T3 + Death's Sting OH
---
I would love for this to be true, but I am withholding judgement until more is learned about this.
---
Unless some new info has come to light recently, a hybrid spec isn't viable like that. Shadow priests in raids shouldn't have mana issues if your farmed for consumables before the raid.
---
Can I post this next week?
---
Also Ghost Wolf is a 3 second cast time in Vanilla. It never was made instant via talents in Vanilla. You seem to think this is the case. Can you explain it?
---
I want a mage undead 60 and use arcane explosion in the middle
---
Combining servers is no different than layering, except it doesn't fuck up the experience along the way. Additionally, it's the literal vanilla experience. So again:
---
&gt; Utterly retarded premise. Didn't kill it at original launch, nor on private servers. Reality is calling.
---
Wwwhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Also, no, Warlocks are used offensively as CoT and interrupt bots on Horde or heavy nukers on Alliance. Every time I read a sentence further in your responses I find more falsehoods.
---
Using 'all the tricks' is what made this class/spec so interesting to play in pvp, I think.
---
Nah, it's level 1. You just need 10 copper. Some speedrunners sell their starting gear, food and water to buy it.
---
Inner fire (improved inner fire gives 30% extra armor as well) and Shadowform lowers physical damage by 15%. Heck you'd probably be slightly more durable than the rogues thanks to shadowforms flat 15% reduction.
---
Well, they're kinda brought for dps. Cause if you have two shadow priests wanting in the raid and you test them out and one does 20-30% more dps or something you'd probably bring him along instead of the other one despite both providing shadoweave.
---
Theoretically you could bind separate controls for each character and play them simultaneously, or have a separate keyboard and mouse for each character, but otherwise yeah.
---
The other issue is that, if you do want to set up special keybindings, you'll need a program to make one of your game windows take input while in the background, since WoW can't do that by default (or at least it didn't used to be able to.)
---
Transmog is good though. If you see someone wearing some hard to get rare PVP armor....they STILL had to obtain it to use it. And you can't use, say, hard to get gear from ICC if you're a level 15 warrior, you have to be of that level to tmog into it. Essentially, your entire argument to "I hate tmog because I like looking like a dumb fucking clown who cant dress himself" and that's silly. 
---
It sucks that i can't use it in classic, but I'll take classic at all over being able to use tmog. There are some fuck ugly sets in this game youre forced to wear because bis
---
Not for Hunters :P
---
Normal classic bug when you lag.
---
Been happening to me for 3 hours. Booted every 1-5 mins. World server down upon reconnect, but after 4-5 attempts it lets me back on. Obviously the world server is not down.
---
I'm in night elf land.
---
how do you know the subscriber numbers and percentages of wow today?
---
Lol I'm in that guild now on my main in BFA. I played a ton of AVs with Kishkumen (Obvi Mute, but I only really played with him on his rogue post name change) all the time. You still subbed?
---
Yep, vanilla bug. Do report.
---
Back in Vanilla days execution of spells was done on a less frequent basis than now. Spells (Or any effects) were not executed straight away as this would have been a large pull on cpu cycles (and still would be). 
---
To get around this all effects/spells were stored in memory on the server to be executed every X milliseconds (Hence batching, a batch of spells) In Vanilla this may have been every 75 milliseconds for arguments sake but in BFA/Current WoW it may be 25 milliseconds. This 75 millisecond batch of spells (for arguments sake) is carried forward from Vanilla to Classic WoW the effect is for example double blinds while dueling, double sheep while dueling, or your heal landing on the tank when he is at 5% but the tank dying to a blow by the monster.
---
This longer time for spell batching was done back in the day to preserve resources hence improving gameplay experience for most, however now is carried over to Classic to preserve authenticity.
---
Upvote because it seems like you put a lot of effort into this and sincerely think this may be viable and not trolling.
---
I don't think its worth it going into Melee range as a SP though.
---
i honestly liked heirlooms and transmog
---
now before you downvote let me clarify
---
mop and after leveling was becoming a chore , i loved leveling 60-70 70-80 etc
---
but when you wanted to make a level 1 and level up it was getting to be a bit of a pain.
---
once there was  a heap of expansions i liked it just for getting an alt up.
---
transmog on the other hand i like the look of the older gear, most of the mop and newer expansions id just transmog to wrath or earlier gear quite often vanilla gear.
---
i would not wamt these features in vanilla but i think they had a place in the more recent expansions.
---
especially the last few where every difficulty of raid is just a different color of the same gear, unless i had the mythic version id just transmog over it
---
Might depend on what level you are. Most the nelf zones are on the west side of Kalimdor, though, and the IF-Menethil flight is shorter than SW-BB.
---
I didn't dabble at all in raiding until Wrath, and it was remarkably easy to pug. Yeah you had to spend some time getting minimal gear, there were some baby steps. But it was doable, and I'm the textbook definition of filthy casual. I think it struck a good balance.
---
I was always okay with the idea that there was content out there I didn't have the inclination, time, or skill to see. I don't see this as a problem. It's like difficult achievements in my xbox games, or superbosses in final fantasy games. I can put in the time and effort to get them, or I can opt out. No big deal. This is perfectly fine, acceptable game design.
---
I thought it was cool that there were some concessions along the way to "this content won't be even remotely relevant in a year or two" and those of us who still wanted to experience while it was, but I don't think this is completely necessary. The world felt bigger when there were threats lurking on the horizon that not everybody would or could march off to face.
---
Oh man you fucked
---
Not having friends is a very useful trait for classic. No one is slowing down your progress or asking for your help with something that doesn't benefit you.
---
I mostly agree with OP, but I do like the idea of having *something* to give my alts to make them better. The thing is, if I have a level 60 main, I can just mail my alts some 16-slot bags and 50 gold and they’re set for life. Heirlooms are completely unnecessary, and the fact that they were allowed in PvP felt like a mistake.
---
I’m a fan of tbc but I’d prefer to see them use this opportunity to try keep the original world meaningful.
---
If I wanted expansion content I’d just play retail.
---
You're totally right. I could see the ease of playing without switching anything would be so nice
---
Well we sure did have it. And yeah, since you apparently don't know that, I doubt you ever played vanilla PvP at a decent level.
---
i would like to know in more detail what you mean when you say they listened to the feedback for legion but not for bfa
---
Ah yes, Stoneform is a problem. Between that and Jungle Remedy I think Troll is the right pick for me.
---
That and I just read about the juicy Berserking + Manaburn interaction.
---
whats the point of this post? even if they werent twinks theyd still roll you for being lvl 10.
---
&gt; Combining servers is no different than layering, 
---
wrong
---
I told my wife that when classic comes out I'm taking a week off work.  I also said it would be a GREAT time to take our son to see his great grandmother in Osaka for a week.  She laughed and made plans.  She also knows that I work and I need my time after our son goes down to do my thing.
---
A couple of things you need to ask yourself (and maybe your wife) is if she has her own alone time without the kids?  Does she work full time as well?  Do you two spend alone time together (non-sexy time related)?  
---
What it boils down to is how much your wife respects your need for your own time.  If you are doing everything that a good father/husband should do then having your own time for yourself to relax and enjoy should be as simple as saying "I need me time.  How about after the kids go to bed I get to have me time."  At the same time don't neglect your wife.  She might be feeling threatened if you have a history of ignoring her to play games.  
---
I guess my best advice is try to be there for your wife while also explaining the importance of your hobbies.  The key is it has to be a hobby for you and not like another full time job.  Maybe try and take the reigns with the kids when you get off work until later in the evening.  Everyone is human.  Explain to her that your not an addict but rather enjoying your own personal hobby.  She doesn't need to understand your hobby or partake in it.  But she does need to know that your family rates higher than the hobby.  If she's stating that you're not responsible then maybe self reflect and see why she feels that way.  Ultimately if you find that you're not and she can't provide examples of irresponsibility then you might have bigger issues in your marriage than you realize.  I can't help you with that but maybe look into marriage counselling.  I doubt the issue is that big though. 
---
Not everyone has the same home life.  My wife has her time during the day because our son goes to a pre-school from 0700 - 1600.  She doesn't work.  She knows that I provide and help after I get off work so when I say I'm going to play games she's doesn't give me much fuss.  She did at the beginning but I explained to her the importance of "me" time.  I was lucky that she understood.
---
Well you can't be a hunter.
---
I like the idea of storymode for those who only want to see the story and don't care about the rewards. It's the only reason I did the content in MoP and WoD, to see the story. I would have done it without an ilvl jump.
---
Druids are perfect for flag carrying; and you don't always have a (good) druid available. And even then, you absolutely need a back-up carrier.
---
I already said that I really value frost mages among top 5 specs for PvP.
---
Feign death and just dps more :P
---
Hunter can't be undead. Other than that I can't help you because it's all personal preference.
---
I want to know what server they're playing on so I can avoid it like the plague.... There is absolutely no good that can come out of playing on a streamers server.
---
Yeah, Troll is super good. I personally can’t play Troll, but that’s just me!
---
You are damn right, I want to play the game in as close a fashion (mechanics wise) to when I did when I was younger.
---
''imagine being the guy who doesn't know weaboo is a derogatory word for people who fetishize japanese culture and lumps it in with people who enjoy chinese things because Asians Is The Same''
---
''weaboo is a derogatory word for people who fetishize japanese culture''
---
Well, that makes the decision easier. Ty!
---
Is there a 2560 x 1440 version of this?
---
its a common prediction but i do not think classic will kill retail.
---
Doesn't this sharding stuff happen on regular retail all the time though?
---
Nature's Swiftness
---
Okay. Show me. 
---
100% you're wrong. Nature's Swiftness was the only way to make Ghost Wolf instant for a Shaman in Vanilla via talents.
---
No, he's talking about the tank, who has to attack from the front.
---
It's not a matter of getting the kill. It's about hurting his pride.
---
Its a stress test. They’re not going to write code to isolate you with other stress test people, that would be asinine.
---
holy shit I forgot how youd have to point your screen down when there would be some fire in front of you lmao.
---
Yet there hasn't even been any evidence of that, just "feelings" when compared to vanilla pservers. 
---
Yet, with the most recent bluepost, it was revealed that basically every pserver was using the wrong calculations making mobs higher level than you easier than they should have been because of *drastically* lower parry and dodge rates.  
---
There's been no actual evidence that any private servers actually made the game harder.
---
tbh this should probably be stickied forever. No more confusion for anyone. I've seen some people saying it was like 20% lol
---
Subbed like 5 days before beta was announced. Playing with some casual mythic raid team, the GM is a friend. Got beta one day 1. Sitting there after the raid...."So hey bud, ya know how I said I'd be your 20th man till 8/27....the thing is..."
---
I actually heard Mute on that Countdown to Classic podcast. Hadnt heard that distinct voice in...well, over a decade.
---
I had a few twinks back then. 
---
49 affliction lock was neigh untouchable. Dot everything and life drain the warrior foolish enough to come after you.
---
39 rogue that mixed it up between combat with riposte and sub to one-shot clothies. Rogue was almost unmatched in this bracket. 
---
I parked my shaman at 39 for a good while with an enchanted Ravager and while the WF procs were insanely enjoyable, waiting for them and not getting them was too painful. 40s with stormstrike saw improvement, but too many other classes got stronger abilities. My fondest memory was one-shotting a gnome warlock, he SS’d back up, health stoned back to full, I walk back over, stormstrike with WF proc and he’s back to dead.
---
I think rogues get poisons at 20 so you want to stay away from 19 bracket there. Warriors/Warlocks are strong in 49 bracket. Hunters are great at 1v1 once they get beastial wrath / aim shot (40). Pretty lackluster before. I really only played Holy for priest in vanilla so I can’t really comment on PvP, it wasn’t great though. Shadow is a different story I’m told.
---
It's funny because Ret is one of the weakest 1v1 classes.
---
Scaling fixes one problem and creates another. What it fixes is leveling past content. It's nice to be able to finish a zone, or do zones in whatever order you wish.
---
The problem it introduces is not feeling like you are getting any more powerful. Monsters you had trouble with at level 10 are still tough at level 58. A big part of MMOs is feeling like you are gaining ground for all your effort, and scaling dilutes that.
---
One solution would be to give completion buffs in each zone. So the more quests you complete in a zone, the stronger your buff is. By the end of that zone, your power compared to the monsters of that zone would be a noticable improvement. These buffs would only work for their intended zone, so doing quests in STV doesn't buff you up to a badass in Barrens.
---
This lets you quest in any order, having each new zone be fresh. But it also rewards your efforts with a sense of gaining power.
---
[So](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Weapon_skill?useskin=oasis) is a very interesting read but it imo invalidates the theory of 315 defense and 305 weapon skill gives 3% hit.  While also confirming the blue post about 8% hit.
---
There used to be an wow wiki weapon skill old id page (that I can no longer find) that also backed up weapon skill being the inverse of defense.
---
Oh aye? Ty for the hunter thing I actually didn't know, and you think? Well anyway ty for the information :)
---
You're much better off downranking spells instead of blowing your load and being a meme melee priest for the rest of the fight.
---
Shadow Oil+Dragonbreath Chili make some sense, but you really shouldn't be in melee in the first place. Again, downrank and don't go oom in the first place.
---
am I losing it or did you re-post this? I thought I commented on it
---
Oh wow. I won't educate you further. You are ignorant of the most basic builds and are still trying to be arrogant after being schooled. You do you, I'll do me. Bye.
---
yeah im rolling orc lock and id rather ride my wolf than a horse anyways. plus an orc lock in t2 running down ally on a wolf sounds like a great time to me
---
I don’t like that playstyle whatsoever. Feel free to cast for 3.5 seconds every pull, but that’s not me. 
---
I’ve tried both ways, and this way is better in my opinion.
---
Also, I’ve gone over this on stream and not on video, but that hit cap will NOT save you from resist values found on mobs throughout the game, which is arguably one of the biggest differences between Classic and pservers.
---
Stealth speed in vanilla is super slow. Rogues are going to be useless unless you enjoy camping flag room all day long while 99% of the fighting happens elsewhere.
---
Yyeeaaahhh !! :P ... I'll drink to that :D
---
You are aware off that you can wield both weapons at the same time?
---
I personally don't think it's a bad idea. Vanilla WoW had a finite amount of content which could theoretically be completed in its entirety, even though it would probably take a lifetime. At the same time though, I understand where everyone else is coming from. They want the original game that was promised to them by blizzard, with no modifications to change the original experience; I would too if I played the game on release.
---
Common knowledge with no evidence. 
---
Also incorrect hit/parry/dodge formula for raid monsters and higher level mobs leading to *drastically* easier raids sure makes for a "harder" experience.
---
Enchanting mats have no vendor value, that's why they have no deposit on the AH.
---
If you desth skip then 1-10 take less than 1 hr 45 min.
---
Which is what I said. And what you didn't know. Now go away.
---
You'd kind of think that they'd separate the beta and stress test so it wouldn't be nine level 10s and a level 19 vs. eight level 10s and two level 19s. It would've been fun to just have pure level 10 BGs.
---
Same for me in Durotar
---
Could I get a PM?
---
One ... to roll on them all :P
---
My guess would be that they wouldn't include it and I don't think anyone will know until it is tried in game
---
&gt; That just sounds like a giant artificial hamster wheel to be honest.
---
Because it is. "Horizontal progression" was always nothing but a pipe dream; it's MMORPG version of utopia.
---
That's like me saying Resto Druids have instant Nature's Touch.
---
And not mentioning that it's on a significant cooldown.
---
And not mentioning that you're 21 points into Resto, so are we talking about *shamans* or *enhancement shamans*?
---
Just like in bfa
---
Haha sorry man yeah I agree with your post. I reposted to add the picture of the swoop to get the full effect.
---
If its anything like these stress tests...no it doesnt help in the starter. Everything past 5 was fine but the starter zones where a shit show trying to kill mobs lol
---
No I was joking 100%. Of course things on beta aren’t going to be exactly the same at time of launch.
---
really? you didnt enjoy exploring the zones or takingnin the scenery or reading the quest lines? bfa zones are absolute masterpieces... they are gorgeous and meticulously detailed and laid out. the quest lines are also good and worth reading through and paying attention to. i also love pandaria and i cant believe you love pandaria but hate kul tiras and zandalar.
---
My experience with retail is minimal at best.
---
Fuck lucky you. I did BFA for the first AOTC and then quit. Just resubbed a few days ago and am hoping for my invite soon. And damn which one was he on? Id like to listen to it.
---
Does it also mean that when there's more people attacking a boss in the front, say 2 tanks, it gets more parries and thus does more damage to the tank?
---
Was thinking about this as well. What do you suggest instead of 5/5 shadow focus? Blackout?
---
I agree with holy fire. I'm using it on the beta and it is so powerful as an opener. Holy fire / mind blast or smite (depending on the rank) / sw pain / wand till death is so damn comfortable.
---
Another question: is improved shadow word pain mandatory? I have the feeling monsters die so quickly that it rarely deals the added damage.
---
Lmao okay 
---
Have fun instant ghost wolfing once every 3 minutes as an enhancement slash resto slash moron shaman while I shit on you.
---
Agree
---
Are you going to pay for dedicated server hardware?  Your sub money goes to shareholders, not to infrastructure.  sharding is real time load balancing to reduce infrastructure expenditure, that's why retail feels like some purgatory where everything ghosts in and out of existence all the time.
---
This guy knows his shit
---
This seems worth testing. Don’t listen to the min-max private server players.
---
I’ve never heard this suggested before.
---
i agree with you. classic will not replace retail.
---
Tolkien basically sat down and tried to write the most bro-tier race ever when he invented his idea of Dwarves - this has caught on with Warcraft, Warhammer, etc. They're inherently likeable.
---
Those pointy eared fucks on the other hand
---
As the wise loading screen tooltip always told us:
---
Remember to take all things in moderation (even World of Warcraft!)
---
4-5 hours a week is easy to fit into a normal schedule. 
---
If you want to play wow, sacrifice your time, not your families. Don't ignore your family and play the game, but maybe give up an hour in the morning, or cut out an activity you already do, like Facebook or something. 
---
Maybe wake up early before work,  go to the gym, then stop at a coffee shop and do 30-60 minutes of questing while you drink your coffee and eat breakfast.
---
 Or whatever works for you. 
---
Treat wow like you would have your kids treat it. You wouldn't want theym on their iPads/Xbox/phone before their homework is done, so you should t play wow before the dishes/garbage/bills are done. Take care of your life first, to prove video games can be done without being destructive.
---
I 100% agree. I hate having multiple raid difficulties and multiple dungeon difficulties for that matter. You can make it like vanilla if you want by making the first raids easier and have them get progressively more difficult. I do prefer the 25 man raid size to others though, I think it is ideal.
---
r/classicwow summed up:  
---
\&gt;asks Blizz to keep the classic spell batching system  
---
\&gt;Blizz implements it exactly as it was  
---
\&gt;fans say Blizz fucked up because they know so much more about the game than Blizz does because they've played Classic on a scratch-made reverse engineered backend
---
Flip a coin.
---
Warlock and priest will be easier to level than the mage will be.
---
If you're into raiding, priest is a good class to get a guaranteed spot as a healer. 
---
Warlocks and mages are both great in PVE and PVP.
---
As a mage you can earn extra money through portals, and everybody loves your food.
---
If this is your first time playing vanilla, I would suggest warlock because like hunters they're easy to level.
---
It also dropped a really good hunter bow for it's level so most hunters didn't know about the CC affect would want to kill it for the bow anyway
---
Played all of vanilla and TBC at a high level (aka infinite time) became a casual and disillusioned with the game mid wrath until now. Hype as fuck for classic. 
---
To your question; since you want undead.. hunter is out of the equation. Can't be an undead hunter in classic. 
---
Mage, Warlock and Priest.. all solid and strong classes that bring something different to the table. 
---
Mages got AoE grind and good kiting potential PvE, great solo class. Raid wise it's pretty dull - more or less just a few buttons to press for your spell rotation. 
---
PvP they can pretty much do well against every class with few counters. The teleport, portals and being a vendor machine is nice utility.
---
Warlocks are fast levelers, strong in solo content and can fight multiple mobs np. Pretty dull lategame raiding tho, as there are limited debuff slots.. so you'll never get the chance to really shine. Very underrated in PvP and PvE lategame. I can't think of anyone a good warlock won't be able to beat in a 1v1 with all CDs. Maybe a warrior.. hmm. You bring great utility and people will like you in a group with the health's tone, soulstone and of course being able to summon. Just know you are always expected to run to the instance first. 
---
Priest - great solo levelers, if a bit slower on the TTK factor. Great sustain though. You'll always have a spot in a group as a healer, if you're into healing. Shadowpriests are strong as fuck too, especially in PvP - it suffers from the same issue warlocks have in PvE raiding tho, so don't expect much there. Healing is fun tho, and gearing will be a breeze.
---
I hope this helps.
---
First of all, UDs can’t be hunter in vanilla
---
If you wanna heal, roll priest. If you don’t wanna heal, don’t roll priest, because theirs a high chance you will end up healing
---
Mage vs Warlock... Mage is great at everything, but there will likely be a lot of them because if it. Warlocks aren’t as good, but has wide toolkit of interesting things, including pets
---
Currently leveling in Mulgore, getting DC'ed every 1-3 minutes. "World Servers are Down" upon reconnecting. Lets me  get back in about 30 seconds later. Rinse repeat. Stress test life &lt;3
---
We'll see what happens. But the general consensus is that Classic raiding will be infinitely easier compared to the grossly overtuned private servers.
---

---
Isn’t that what the talents are for? Increase stealthed movement speed?
---
Yeah,  a level 10 doesn't stand a chance in WSG!
---
TY!
---
oh my god I had truly forgotten about this.
---
You don't have to be an "edgelord" to hate kung-fu pandas. Any normal bloke will do.
---
Dw i got no friends either =P
---
going NA West pvp server alliance
---
I am going a healer though so hopefully a raiding should be easy enough for me to get into.
---
One of my many great memories, getting the server first and pre-nerf Mimiron kill.
---
&gt; All of those are entirely possible with a few adjustments to gems and itemization.
---
With *massive* adjustments.  
---
You could make this argument and just bake it into enchanting.  
---
There's no reason to simplify it. Upgrades on your gear might all be able to be hashed together into some kind of awful amalgamation, but that removes depth.
---
You think so? I'll take your advise into consideration friend! I can always level an ult after!
---
Aww.. you poor thing. Want a cookie to turn that frown upside down?
---
Mmos are are personal tbh man I could tell you to be a mage cause the damage is amazing and it’s a fun class but by lvl 30 you might hate it and have wasted a few days of your time and may want to quit the game cause of that. It’s just tough to tell people what to play. I played 7 classes before I Mained my mage back in cataclysm till now. So I know I’ll be going into classic playing mage. Just takes time and trial and error to be real with you friend but good luck! Hope you find an easier way
---
Undead Spriest are pretty insane in PvP and Holy is one of the most sought after healers. Mages are a blast and have great group utility as they can make food water and portals, they also have great dps. Warlock is one class I could never get into, they can summon people which is cool, but when raiding bosses have a debuff limit which pretty much restricts warlocks to shadowbolts only.
---
Anyone remember Cosmos or pre-nerf decursive (literally spam a macro)?
---
Happy cake day
---
Wasn't crit resistance a stat in TBC? Resilience?
---
From the blue post: Critical Strike chance is reduced by 1% per each additional level the target has over the player. (So if you have a 4% chance to crit an at-level target, you have a 1% chance to crit a +3-level target, in both clients.)
---
Does that literally mean that any crit below 4% is effectively 0 to a raid boss? Does this change gearing for optimal dps in a way that wasn't thought of previously?
---
bring it back on i cannot wait to get keyed again!!!
---
Can this be helpful?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Extracting_interface_files
---
Just a show? Not only are they bug fixing they are running an original client themselves to test if the bugs are bugs or just how the game worked. The last thing we need is a ton of private server players that think their bad version of classic is the authentic one. There are a lot of private server players that didn't even play classic! It would be better to just let players with classic accounts to play classic wows beta.
---
2 minutes*
---
yeah it's a cost saving system, you shard everything dynamically to reduce hardware expenditure, slight downside is your game feels like you're in some ghosting nightmare.  They should spend less on shareholders and executive bonuses and more on actual fucking server hosting hardware.
---
Its not feasible unless you outgear it though... which makes it not viable
---
gonna be genuinely honest, i've never laughed so hard at this meme before
---
I'd love to see you try it out and give feedback!

Well thank you for your honesty and the upvote. I did actually put a lot of effort into this...
---
I guess I just wanna play a shadow priest and only be good/brought for shadoweave and ignored for gear cause LOL why would we give you gear instead of the warlock who does way more damage than you. I just really like shadow priests and wanna be a really good one and figure out some sort of secret in order to maximize their dps. A pipe dream I imagine at this point.
---
I don't think this is spell batch related, this is a bug with projectile spells that are already casted(in the air)  when seduction gets applied.  
---
Saw the same thing happen with iron grenade: [https://clips.twitch.tv/FragileAdventurousSpiderMikeHogu](https://clips.twitch.tv/FragileAdventurousSpiderMikeHogu) (Frostbolt that lands way later doesn't break the stun, any damage should).
---
This helps a bunch! A lot of information to take in Haha! But it still gives me the pro's and con's so I couldn't ask for more. I completely forgot about shadow priests though! But it seems they all have their equal downsides. I'll take this into consideration when picking. Like I said in another comment I guess I can always level an ult.
---
wasnt there a 12 slot bag buried off coast of hinterlands?
---
Instead of having 2k humans fighting for the lvl 1 wolves, you have 500 of them. Huzzah!
---
It's gonna suck regardless.
---
Holy shot I forgot how much I love Thunder Bluff
---
Yes please, can't deal with these indie companies anymore.
---
That’s a shame bro. When I told my wife about classic wow and how excited I got, she understood that this is what I’m doing. Supports my decision to buy a new pc as well just for the occasion. 
---
Back when vanilla was out she was my gf who saw me raid/pvp so after taking pretty much 7 years off of WoW, I’m back and she’s cool with it.
---
Mana burns? Did you mean priest?
---
For the most part I think imma be on my own running a mage with tail/enchanting so feel free to hit me up. Na west also
---
Aye aye about the Undead thing I have made an edit Haha! And the healing thing doesnt bother me if anything I welcome it! I want a challenge but with my limited knowledge I dont wanna push it too far.
---
the layer size won't change, it'll feel just like the stress tests.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
If content doesn't have some sort of reward system, that breaks my immersion, because I notice the discontinuity in the game's reward systems. There are always ways to improve my character, and so that's what I choose to do! That's the whole point of the game! I'm just playing it... it's not complicated.
---
&gt; threat capped at end game IIRC.
---
nah. once you have a super geard fury tank and world buffs the threat gap on private servers is pretty massive.
---
maybe for horde? but alliance will have no problem with dual weilding tanks still
---
Oh damn! Pog for you my dude!
---
Rogues have dodge talents and avoidance mechanisms you don’t have.
---
You're going to be nothing compared to the attention whores on their streams trying to camp them regardless. Worst case scenario for the streamers, they'll play offstream for a bit.
---
10-19 they don't have feral form, no increased move speed.
---
10-19 is 100% dominated by hunters and rogues.
---
meme already made at least 3x not trying to be a dick
---
Eh. I'm not convinced that Blizz devs could seamlessly create new content for classic. I'd rather take another authentic step first before we start meddling with the game.
---
Yep even from lowest bracket they are strongst
---
Basically it's just an idea I had based on the fact that shadow priest OOM fast and use wands. And since wands are crap...why not just pretend to be a spelladin for a hot minute in order to increase dps instead.
---
I know I have to. I'm equally torn between Mage (which I've played on private server) and Warrior (which I haven't played since vanilla/TBC, but mained then). And also a bit of priest...
---
So whether I'll level the mage or warrior first.. who knows X)
---
You seem to have a different definition of common knowledge. The reality if private servers is that the bosses are overtuned but still easier than classic wow. Private server creators literally had to guess at how some mechanics worked which created a much easier experience than the original.
---
You have to be a virgin trying hard to prove how manly you are to hate an entire expansion of content because you perceive the *animals* used in that expansion to be childish.  
---
So many people wrote off the expansion before it even launched. It was one of the best expansions WoW ever had, and people wrote it off entirely over pandas.  
---
If you dislike pandas because you're insecure with your masculinity, that's totally fine. You have that right. But at least give the expansion a chance for its **gameplay**. Its gameplay was phenomenal.  
---
If you dislike MoP's gameplay for some reason (can't see why you would: PvP was the best it had been since BC, raiding was possibly the best WoW ever had, reputations were complex, secondary professions were complex... you'd *really* just have to be very angry over LFR), then that's fair. That's a reasonable judgement.  
---
If you choose not to play the expansion or badmouth it because you think "kung fu pandas" (a word combination never said about the expansion from anyone other than said edgelords I'm referring to), then you're an edgelord.  
---
Also I'd even say that you'd have to be an edgelord to just hate on kung-fu pandas. There's not much to hate about them. It's a martial art and an animal. I wouldn't hate Karate Coyotes or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Anacondas, so I can't think of any reason to hate "Kung Fu Pandas."
---
Sadly ur right.
---
Nono! I welcome this! No error at all all useful information :), but aye I agree with the person preference thing. I am planning of leveling ults so in the end I will probably end up the same as you Haha.
---
It’s not even a min-max mentality. You just won’t be brought for anything except healing and shadow weaving. 
---
Classic doesn’t have DPS healers like Retail does. You’re honestly a waste of a raid slot if you think you’ll be brought for DPS and get geared over mages and warlocks... who actually do real damage.
---
I see the gryphons are still lifeless and don't lean into their turns like they're supposed to :(
---
I dunno that there was m8. Maybe though, who knows, but I can’t find any references to it. There were server transfers - high pop could go to low pop and what not, but that was specific and done for server health, and free. 
---
I think your cognitive biases may be at play. They are with everyone &lt;3
---
Yes, that is true, on privas it's bugged so that it can't be resisted.
---
But even in Classic/vanilla it's quite rare for FD resist to ever happen, and pretty much guaranteed to never happen if you take the 2 talent points.
---
Overall the same tactic works consistently.
---
Yeah private servers don't work at all. People hated nost lol, you can't be serious.
---
Hard modes weren't the problem, easy modes were.
---
I remember hearing about a so called shadowbolt meta that does put me off a bit. And I'm worried a bit about priest as I know they have mana issues but I welcome the challenge. I think.
---
It seems like it's getting worse. I can only stay in the game now for about 15 seconds. Trying to run back to Dolanar.
---
Honestly sounds to me that transmog isn't the problem, but rather the old content was made irrelevant. Can't really be impressed by their gear when you know they could have easily solo'd it. 
---
I'm unfamiliar with heirlooms so I have no comment on that.
---
Yeah, remove layering and increase server numbers.
---
All of these WoW wiki sites are scuffed. They always lack some very essential information about whatever you are reading about, and you have to look through the comments sections to find the knowledge you are looking for.
---
But what if doing this provides more dps then downranking and allows for faster mana regen cause you can do okay damage while attacking and not casting spells and then go ham again when full.
---
Cause remember downranking still stops the 5 second rule. With this, you'd hit that 5-second rule and regen mana much faster while potentially doing okay dps.
---
You're right. 
---
But considering the time difference between video raid boss kills and all the pserver kills which tend to be much faster are we really under some illusion that it's going to be significantly higher?  
---
I mean, yeah, with this info it's clear that pserver tanks get way higher threat and less damage taken meaning fury warrs can do more dps and you can get away with fewer healers, but still...
---
Yep, and before someone says "it's about consolidating servers to enhance the experience!"  give me a fucking break, it's about reducing server hardware costs, the actual experience is a fucking nightmare killing this entire franchise slowly so some asshole IT manager can post reduced expenses.
---
Undercity ambient noises blew my mind also. Still remember the first time it was shown to me. Undead Warlock Crushwire took my undead Priest around the world telling me the lore of everything.
---
My pally does not appreciate :(
---
Imagine playing a game where your primary reward system consists throwing unearned slotmachine items at you en masse and "choosing" whether to use item A over item B based on a singular number that's slightly higher than the other because the developers think you're too retarded to make choices.
---
It's all this hype! It's hard to decide I'll probably have level 60's of all classes and still couldn't be able to choose! It's a curse.
---
I think he is just calling you a beta cuck, could be wrong though.
---
Naxx gear *was* good up until level 70. I'm not sure where you're getting that or what game you're remembering.
---
I hate the layout and I feel like we’ve already seen it all before. All the quests were exactly the same so I really didn’t pay that much attention to them
---
I remember the good and bad, but I also remember it being new and a lot of my feeling was a "first timer" feeling, so I'll go in it (again) with an open mind but will also approach it logically so I won't be disappointed.
---
&gt; You have to be a virgin trying hard to prove how manly you are to hate an entire expansion of content because you perceive the animals used in that expansion to be childish. 
---
But it wasn't just "animals used in the expansion", it was *the entire expansion*. It takes place in kung-fu pandaland.
---
&gt;Its gameplay was phenomenal.
---
Yeah. Shame about the setting which you can't avoid if you value immersion in your videogames at all.
---
still haven't answered.
---
guess who's the idiot trying to show off :)
---
It’s a stress test, they couldn’t give two shits about balancing the BG queues
---
That's so laughable.  "grossly overtuned" with no evidence and videos of kills that happen twice as fast as they happened in vanilla.  
---
Grossly overtuned with 9% less boss parry and 1% less boss dodge.  Yep.  totally "overtuned" to have profoundly easier bosses.
---
my moma
---
What do you mean with "chances of being part of AQ"? Does the amount of players affect your chance at joining a raid/raid guild? I'd think the more the better. Serious question. Haven't played in like 12 years.
---
I was actually considering to join a server with streamers simply because of the unique events they might cause (like that dragon in stormwind). I'm not gonna fan-boy and follow the guy. What do I care. But the fact that you could have these weird things happen sounds interesting.
---
thank god for layering
---
Yes, that was the second reason that competent guilds would kick dps who somehow wandered in front of the boss, it wasn't just because cleaves would kill them, it was because of parries leading to burst on the tank.
---
Who needs the casuals anyway, if you dont play warrior and cant clear naxx on week 1, you really dont deserve the classic experience.
---
Same. First stress test I waited 4 hours and logged in after the rush and had no problems. This time I get DC'd or can't even login for like 2 hours now.
---
Beta acces completely killed my BFA play time, down to only login 2 nights a weeks to help some guildy wipe on h mekatork.
---
No more money making business, no more xmog farming, I'm not trying to improve my gear/Ap, nothing!
---
And today  I max my fishing at 225 on my lvl 20 druid. Screw you retail!
---
Lmao pallys aren't shit 1v1
---
I'm guessing it's a reference to Viper Sting, the hunter ability.
---
Or even use Radeon Chill in AMD settings too :)
---
Gotcha I misunderstood
---
Really? I heard that the main issue holding back shadow priest dps is mana issues. If they actually don't have mana issues shouldn't they be pretty good dps?
---
also, it's not really a hybrid spec. All those procs your trying to get ALL scale of spell damage and spell crit. You just whack'em for those procs. The white damage is just a bonus.
---
gear is a bit more than that, in my opinion. azerite traits and talent choices can change the way your character handles just as much as legendaries in legion, but people do not seem curious to try new things. i aso think azerite reforging and spec changing is necessary based on individual encounters and mythic+ affixes, but again, most people do not have the patience and curiosity to try things out and get frustrated and quit, or thet bang their heads on the wall or grind what they can until their ilvl goes up enough to make harder content possible. the game is currently quite a bit more complex and interesting than people give it credit for.  i think there is a prevailing choice to basically ignore contemplating what azerite traits and talents would be useful in what game situation, and instead google what the “best” is and just go with that and never think about it again, which leaves the player (if they are only concerned with gaining power) nothing but a grind for bigger numbers which is mind numbing even for troglodytes. everyone points to the journey and difficulty aspects of classic but those exist in retail currently now too. to have a journey, it is somewhat on the player to approach the game as such. retail has become more “arcadey” in that the systems are really streamlined and finely tuned and there is a lot of balance, such that many different styles of character can both feel unique and be viable in any part of the game. classic on the other hand was more clunky with class design. i remember hitting 60 on my shaman and wanting to raid, discovering my enhancement spec that i loved for pvp was not viable and that i would have to farm some cloth pieces to get int to heal in a raid setting. i mean, it was kind of frustrating, lol. and as far as leveling and questing through the game, i dont remember too much except a lot of fun chatting in the barrens and seeing it attacked, and journeying to winterspring, and straight grinding mobs from 58-60 cuz i had no more quests or something. lol. it was a fun game but retail is also very fun and a lot less frustrating. at the end of the day, theres more similarities than differences between classic and retail. you are grinding your character through the world for loot and points - gold, exp, fishing, artifact power, rep, ilvl. it will always be this core gameplay. i personally think the story and quests in bfa are quite interesting and i will be very interested to revisit the classic quests to see how they hold up. my memory of classic zones is that they were much more charming than cataclysm, but that the quests were also much more challenging.
---
you can still have all of that, but in a way that is technologically sound so that we can still have graphics and ray tracing and all the quality of a next gen game.
---
BFA made me hate dwarves and their woons
---
My favorite feeling was getting an orange - red quest, trying to complete it and failing. After that you leak your wounds, finish a dozen other quests, come back a few levels higher and wreck that previously difficult quest. Sweet!
---
Tbh I’d like to see them take a leaf out of the old school mmo models and try incorporate some different systems rather than piling on expansions with new theme parks to enjoy temporarily.
---
The original world is great, add systems that keep it dynamic and meaningful, not new maps or dungeons/raids.
---
Exactly my friend you’ll find your class soon enough
---
its only kalimdor, eastern kingdoms is fine
---
Aye aye! I'm just mostly hype to be leveling with a bunch of friends :)
---
eastern kingdoms is fine its just kalimdor
---
Indeed, but a lot of people in this reddit are die hard blizz fans who buy anything they say it seems and attack people who don't blindly follow without questions.
---
Troll male has the best offensive casting animation.
---
For heals I like the human woman animation
---
Makes the comments match the upvotes.
---
That actually sounds pretty cool too! Not sure how to work with that though since i know kitties have some weird scaling stuff since they dont use their weapons.
---
That storm wind music after running through elwynn forest. 👌🏻

You may have forgot, I actually was replying to your immature comment.

Don’t be surprised if someone calls you out on your sht.

Seems server is down or keeps crashing.  It's 11 pm Blizzard time, so we might be screwed until morning.

30 points into enhance+enhance gear still are an enhance shaman.
---
wow, i really disagree with the way you feel. i thought each zone was unique and charming in its own design and in the quest lines which got into interesting stories and characters. and they are so beautiful that i still like to just roam through them to fish and gather (and ambush unsuspecting alliance).

"Found a ring in 'er last night"
---
Get off vent, or I'll have you bent.
---
Will be as they came out in 1.12 and that's the patch classic starts with.
---
It'd be a lot of work to test this out and have it not work. but the more I look at stuff the more i wanna be a shadow priest. So I'll definitely have to eventually test out the idea once i get to 60 and a decent proc mace of some kind.
---
Honestly it doesn't have to be great dps...just better then wanding to be worth it.
---
That's a bug from actual vanilla. I wouldn't be shocked if it has been purposely reproduced.
---
Oh you poor thing, get ready.
---
Its fine if you forget to do something but if i ask you to change it and you dont listen to me then gtfo of my raid/dung/anything
---
FF14 comes to mind
---
Direct me to exactly which post in this comment chain you're referring to, but 
---
" * If the monster's defense is 1 to 10 points greater than your weapon skill, you suffer 0.1% chance to miss per point.
---
  * If the difference is more than 10, the penalty is doubled to 0.2% per point "
---
This post agrees with 305 wep skill vs 315 defense = +1% miss chance for a total of 6% miss chance (2% free hit from +5 skill) and that 300 vs 315 Def = +3% chance to miss for a total of 8% miss chance, which is in line with Blizzard's Blue post.
---
No one will ever want to team up for a named mob or a rarespawn out of fear that they'll get sharded.  I've lost another ghost howl to it and until this is changed won't be inviting anyone to party with a mob spawn confirmed.
---
 Ah y blizzard definetely has no past record of releasing broken game, there is absolutely no way this shit stays right ?
---
If you're not allowed to fuck around and try out stuff it wouldn't be classic.

Thanks for your answer, I tend to overthink stuff. I just had a quite rough experience with few guilds, but was stuck there for quite a while due to RL friends.
---
On the other side, yeah, this kind of experience is what I'm looking for. In fact tried hunter because of the pulling ability (since it's something I'm quite used to, in EQ is the bard and/or enchanter's duty) and, well, the Rhok'delar quest sounds like an interesting experience for an inmersion-heavy guy like me.
---
Is it even possible to have below 4% in pre raid gear? Would agi or int just naturally give you enough?
---
If you are relying on white hits for procs it's pretty hybrid. You may not need strength but chance to hit probably had a bigger effect on it than you think.
---
As for spriests, their damage isn't great but its moderately successful with consumables. There are runes you can farm that exchange health for mana. On patch 1.12 it converts HP to mana. The main problem is they are BoP so your forced to farm for them yourself.
---
Just how every FPS console game after 2001 was going to be the "Halo killer," when all they had to do was wait and Halo would kill itself.
---
I think you mean Nature's grasp, 35%!
---
Is Thunder Bluff the Ram Ranch of vanilla? I know they’re cows but they all have horns...
---
Hey, give it a shot. If you can squeeze better damage into your downtime, all the better. 
---
Know that the reason it works for the Spelladin is Seal of Righteousness. The melee swing has a chance to proc all weapon effects, then the seal landing also has a chance to proc the same effects again, effectively doubling the benefit of those consumables.  Combine that with the Manual Crowd Pummeler's on use, or Ironfoe's extra swings, and you squeeze a surprising amount of damage out of them. 
---
As a priest, I don't think you have access to the same kind of tools. Its always good to have more proven knowledge though.
---
That's a valid concern, and maybe you are right.
---
I don't subscribe to that believe though. IN my opinion, classic will draw on a population of older players, and curious new ones. And both populations have good and bad and average players.
---
Priest only have mana issues if you dont understand down ranking. They will have mana issues if you are playing shadow but good luck doing that at 60. Personally for me I would choose between Priest and Mage.
---
It’s going to be funny and sad in a years time when people are doing 20 man clears of MC because it’s so easy and people complain that they should have returned the raid. #nochanges is one of the worst thing for classic, I hope they make some servers that are, you know, balanced for a 2019 game.
---
I can't read this without hearing the male Tauren voice say it.
---
If you watch any popular streamer you will see people throw gold and items at them constantly. No normal player can compete for the scarab lord title with a streamer being fed by thousands of fans.
---
I don't hate streamers, but I'd really rather not share a server with them.
---
35 pound catfish
---
You gotta include genders too!
---
Does this potentially mean that hybrid classes playing as DPS will look better on the meters in Classic compared to private servers?
---
If warrior, rogues, and mages can't go 100% ham because of threat problems, does it make the DPS gap between hybrid classes and pure classes smaller?  
---
Or do hybrids also have threat problems if they go 100% ham?
---
My point of reference is Vanilla, SC2, and Overwatch betas. Can't speak for bugs in BFA beta.
---
thats why i'd go human for that +5 maces skill to help with that hit.
---
Hmm so even if mana wasn't an issue shadow priest dps still isn't very good? That's rather disheartening. I was always told that mana issues was the one thing holding them back.
---
This is so great.
---
Always welcomed into a raid, easy as hell to level, fun in PvP, free lvl 40 mount, the whole shard thing isn't that bad.
---
I also love the hands-by-her-sides casting animation for human female. Although is it different when she's healing vs offensive casting? I can't remember
---
I mean, it was stated by blizz devs that it was only intended for non-raider progression and they understood raiders would not find it worthwhile.
---
Yessssss
---
Yes, we send our women to raid your backdoor because it excites us to see how handily they sack your vulnerable spots.
---
There is no such thing as "faster mana regen". You aren't running spirit gear as a shadow priest. You're either using mana pots/runes to keep your mana up or you aren't. You aren't going to use the 5-second rule anyways since you need to hit the boss constantly with shadow *spells* in order to keep Shadow Weaving up.
---
You aren't doing okay DPS while meleeing. You might do slightly better than wanding if you meme the hell out of it, but if you've went oom you've already failed at your job, which is keeping Shadow Weaving on the boss.
---
Your job as an spriest isn't to do damage, it's to buff the warlock's DPS by a whopping 15%. You doing decent damage is just the cherry on top. If you go oom and can't keep that 15% damage increase for your warlocks, you've failed at your one and only job.
---
There is no such thing as "dungeon completion" in classic. You cannot complete the quests while in a raid group, if that is what you mean.
---
Too bad you're on NA. I've setup a small "private" EU horde discord community for friends and friends of friends. 
---
But to be honest.. when I played vanilla originally I didn't have any friends to play with. Gaming was frowned upon, WoW especially back then.
---
I met them in WoW. To this day, quite a few from that time is currently in the horde discord I made :)
---
Classic WoW will make you friends. I don't have an ounce of doubt about it.
---
Level 18awhuhhh uhhhh
---
I was almost 20.
---
Thank you for those kind words. I realized that this game affected me so much when I started watching old kill videos or just watched cinematics and I started to cry Because those feelings do carryover to this day.
---
i don't know if a numerical increase on things will make the game 'harder'
---
Still better than people who haven't touched the game in 13 years..
---
*laughs in curse of shadow*
---
You totally got this.
---
That only works if you are logged into the google services, which some people don't want to.
---
Uh, I feel dumb asking this but down ranking? Is that using the lower ranked spells?
---
Yea I definitely wouldn't rely on this for my core damage but I feel pretty certain it could do more damage then wanding. 
---
Though I'm afraid it may not be worth it. With players being much better raid fights should be noticeably shorter and if you bring the proper consumables...shadow priest may not actually run out of mana before the fight ends. I wonder how that will effect their dps rankings if mana is considerably less of an issue due to fight length being so much shorter.
---
As a random guess I'd say the slowest is something like 20-25% slower. So if we say hunter is 5 days warrior/rogue would be around 6 days.    
---
    
---
Take off whatever is convenient to you. I think for most people even if they take the whole week off 17 hours of playing a day will drive you a bit crazy after 2-3 days. A lot of people literally won't be able to handle the eye/hand strain from that much playing. So yeah just try to enjoy it. If it takes you an extra week to get to 60 it really makes no difference whatsoever in the long run.  
---
And no, front stabbing won't work on official servers. Never has and never will.
---
I believe that was changed back to 50/50 last week
---
 Its because half of this sub are fans of streamers that are fully in blizz ass, they are just being good donators and subs xD  old blizz back gusy xD just a beta xD just first two weeks xD just phase one xD layering actually makes sense xD
---
I wouldn't be shocked if there are legit guilds with looser attendance requirements this time around. Much older crowd will be playing.
---
You could write an addon to accomplish that.
---
If you can’t kill a 40 man raidboss down with one ”mediocre” spec, your raid is garbage. Everything is viable
---
I just don’t understand why you would want to go through all this trouble to *still* be mediocre DPS and knowing you’ll never get geared unless all of the Mages and Warlocks are already set. 
---
It just seems... exhaustive trying to force a triangle peg into a circle hole just because you like the way the triangle peg looks. 
---
Priests in Classic heal in raids, it’s where the mana-management and regen talents are and it’s what you’re best at. Honestly if you’re so determined to DPS as a caster, go demo Warlock and just sac your pet during raids. It’s basically the same thing at that point and you’ll do far more damage, have far better uptime, you don’t risk getting cleaved to death (because let’s face it, even with Inner Fire and Shadowform you’re moving from wet toilet paper defense to bounty paper towel level) by having to be in melee range, *AND* you’ll get geared along with everyone else.
---
But, it should be stated, Fury 2h tanking takes a massive hit with this.
---
I was thinking about when it was added as well it was added in the Mists of Pandaria patch according to wowpedia.
---
I am torn between a Warrior and a Rogue, I mained a rogue through BC.  I will have a pocket healer, so leveling and dungeons will be quick. Mass pulling as a tank with a healer, and the random dps in the area. I will do BS or LW till I can create the BiS pre raid for what ever class I choose. Then I will go engineering because explosives and mind control.
---

---
Just like my ex rip
---
As an RPG player it's incredibly dumb that all of your power comes from clothes in the first place.
---
I'm pretty certain a single SW:P would be more then enough to maintain shadow weaving stacks. Also just fyi of a fun fact Shadow Oil and the Ebon Hand I had linked up there...proc a version of shadow bolt and count as shadow spells which can keep up shadow weaving.
---
Likewise!
---
oh man, now i remembered, yeah I heard of this book before, was briefly mentioned by a fellow guildie who talk about changing leatherworking spec, thanks!
---
Private servers "work" because the player cap is extremely high, if they even have one. The current top private server has 2 high pop servers with like 9k ppl and 2 low pop servers.  
---
This isn't the same situation, at all.
---
When classic launches, damn near everyone currently playing wow, and toms of others will make an account. We are talking upwards of a few million people. Most of those people won't be active players though. Maybe 10% will stick around, if that.
---
If a server pop is 3000, and only 10% of players stick around, then there will only be 300 active players on a full server shortly after release. Every server would be low pop to dead, which means people couldn't get groups, which means it would drive even more people away. Blizz would then have to combine servers, which a lot of ppl don't want.
---
This is why blizzz is using layering. They know that there will be a mass exodus of players, so they're preparing for it ahead of time.
---
Yeah after dcing 50+ times in the span of an hour I was only able to get to lvl 5 before I had enough of it. Still better than bfa, just wish I could actually sit down and play it. Got work in the morning. For those who can stay up all night and play hope you get passed all the damn dcing!
---
Let me try to explain to your pea brain how detrimental a streamer-only server would be from the perspective of streamers.  
---
Because the server is streamer-only, the population would be much, much lower than if they were on regular servers with regular players. With a lower population, raiding becomes much more difficult, and would require many streamers to all start playing at the same time. When all of the streamers are playing at the same time, only the most popular streamers get the views, making the less popular streamers lose out on views they could be getting if they were able to play on a regular server during times in which the popular streamers aren’t playing.  
---
Yes, people can watch streams while they play, but they would likely be watching the popular streamers. Like I said in the last sentence of my previous post, this makes 39 of the 40 streamers in a raid obsolete. The next time you want to jump in with a stupid ass reply, please read everything you’re replying to before you hit that post button
---
Alliance raids will want to bring at least a handful of paladins for their buffs and auras. Being able to have salvation, light, and wisdom/might on the whole raid is pretty nice, and there are a few fights where the resistance auras are important. While having paladins is really preferred, there's 40 slots and at some point you're needing to just fill in with bodies.
---
Will a hardcore raiding guild going for server firsts take a ret paladin? Nah. Will a guild that likes you take you? Probably.
---
Why not put like a 4 hour delay on?
---
Kralnor was the real deal. Not like that "pro-wrestler" Alamo dork the Druids jerked off to.
---
Never: Female Tauren, Female Trolls, Female Dwarves, Female Humans, Male Night Elves, Female Priests, Female Warriors, Female Druids, Male Warlocks, Female Shaman, Female Paladin
---
&gt;I would que into BGs and thought it was bullshit that people got special gear just for having a capped character.
---
lol twinks though
---
I am sure there will be a lot of discord communities, if you want you will easily find some online friends.
---
You have queues for brackets 10-19 20-29, etc and 60.
---
Bgs have no timers, objectives must be complete before it ends like all 3 flags captured in wsg
---
I'm playing a warlock nobody that ive been watching on streams really is playing warlocks there's like 3 that ive seen.
---
lol, frostshock he says. People are in for a big surprise in classic.
---
eh, its better than having everything turn grey after a handful of quests. And as you move on expansions you progress that way so I don't think its that bad
---
I’m not really upset, more just surprised that you thought there was only one type of challenge in games.
---
&gt; It does however increase the damage of your glancing blows 
---
Never knew that, lol.
---
🙄 okay buddy.
---
But meme specs apparently do 0 dps, haven't you been paying attention. 
---
If an under geared player can't do more than 0 dps proper gear won't help them.
---
The biggest issue I see with this without even figuring the math is you being in melee range. I see you getting kicked out of groups. I see the Healer flipping out on you because you're getting hit and they can't keep you up when they should be focusing on the tank. I see the group getting pissed off because you keep getting killed.
---
I agree with all of this.
---
Especially the part where lower lvl materials are used for something higher levels want . If they add anything, it should be more of this.
---
I was thinking the same thing as I want to mainly raid with a bit of pvp on the side. But I believe cats with 1.2 attack speed are still better because they can use claw (I guess wolves only have paws not claws...). Using claw on the target will cause more pushbacks (not 100% on this).
---
Also not sure how much the difference between 1.0 attack speed and 1.2 attack speed will make (I would want Humar if speed didn't make to much difference in pushing back spell casting).
---
Hi, /u/Embriel
---
Found the link to see my account creation date and seing this broke my heart again.
---
My hunter needs some DW thunderfuries
---
To be fair those "we're just better" comments refer to the &lt;30 content of the beta, even if pservers have dramatically more Parry you would probably only notice it at high level content where the margins matter more.
---
That's awesome. Making those moments happen is what vanilla is all about. Smelling the roses of Stormwind, walking the sewers of the Undercity, getting lost amidst the treetops of Darnassus, tracking a kodo across the plains of Mulgore... sweet, precious immersion, and taking the time to drink it in with a friend sharing the lore of the world.
---
Where is this generic thing comming from? Most bosses on private servers have different armor. In fact as much as we know it is buffed on private servers.
---
Interestingly enough, selected the Music Loop setting doesn't loop music for me, it still only plays once. Not sure if known bug, but I have no add-ons to clash with.
---
What makes you think this is a bug and not just the system as intended?
---
There's this
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7juf/census_left_running_for_just_3_hours_on_the_eu
---
Ahh yeeee static-x
---
There's no training dummys in vanilla bro.
---
Lmao, Jesus I hope this is satire.
---
I reclaimed my 2005 account a couple months ago and still had this equipped on my hunter. Along with tons of ammo and random food for my pets. Also found a deviate scale belt recipe on my rogue. Good times.
---
Lol... competent guilds?  You mean the hardcore progression guilds that raided 5-6 days a week, 4-6 hours a day?  
---
Most serious raiding guilds weren't 'that' cruel man.
---
There was also a talent that increased mounted speed, not sure if it was in classic or added later though.
---
Human priest... missing out on the sexy dwarf racials
---
you're thinking resist based on levels which cant be penetrated. the 1% miss chance is pvp only
---
mobs disappearing randomly is pretty damaging...
---
Kale smoothies.
---
&gt;when my toon decked out in full raid gear and months of progression still takes the same amount of time to kill bears and wolves as it did 10 levels ago.
---
Well you clearly haven't played the game because you do become more powerful. As your item level increases you scale faster than the world and become more powerful. The difference between an ilvl 300 and 370 player in the open world is massive.
---
what you’re missing is that as a shadow priest in a raid, your ONLY job is to keep shadow weaving up while you *HEAL*
---
 They are just gamer dads and overall shit players, stuff doesnt matter for them, all they wanna do is watch their favourite streamer.
---
Think that was after the auras were reworked, much later to classic. Could be wrong but pretty sure they didn't have mount speed increases in classic
---
Yea, dont get me wrong Ill probably hate myself at the end of the week, but rogues are gonna be over saturated so I wanna get early 60 and start working on professions and pre-raid BiS so I can get a good guild. Thats the plan at least.
---
I will enjoy the leveling on an alt though. However, I kinda wanna no life my first 60 lol. This might be the last time I can get a week off to truly no life a game like I did back in 5th-12th grade.
---
Thanks for the info man, I really appreciate the reply.
---
This might be a problem for dual wielding fury tanks though, as they'll trigger more parries. That's less threat and more damage incoming.
---
Tell it you're the Father of Dragons.
---
Oooh... humans and Tauren should have been bi-faction at release
---
Aaand virtually no1 jus what they were doing, and those that did probably didn't know how to optimize their play. The teamwork is better too. The cheesing is better. People know about and can effectively take advantage of the five second rule. People know what stats they should stack. We know what talents are the best.
---
With an this is mind, yeah a low level dungeon in a casual friendly MMO would be that easy.
---
Yea even with shadowform and inner fire it's probably not enough. It was fun to theory craft at the very least.
---
It could also mean that some circumstances could lead to a player being moved to a different layer, even if they’re trying to keep the player on the same layer.
---
Let’s hope we can get some actual written explanations from Blizzard so we don’t have to guess / and or interpret from these unclear interviews with unknowledgable streamers.
---
yes you can... if you dont want to then wait a month instead of ruining the whole game with a stupid system.
---
As someone who played vanilla, and agrees with spell batching at its current state right now off. By about 1/3 of a second or so.
---
have you seen the threat gaps with buffs and geared fury tanks? no ones pulling aggro lol
---
If they changed it, then it was undocumented.  
---
As in, normally in the old patch notes we can see they typically change something, but simply don't have specific numbers behind the change.  There is no mention of a hit/parry mechanic change what so ever.
---
Ahh farming HK’s in the gy in wsg for hours and week long alterac valley games, good times!
---
But yes you need to queue from and now just like you did in tbc
---
Almost like it's a bug.
---
Not really. MMOs, due to their massive nature, have been and always will be behind the curve when it comes to graphics. You can't have it all. Size and scope demand a sacrifice.
---
When singleplayer games start looking like that, which might happen in a few generations, add 5 to 10 years and MMOs will catch up.
---
I think I just walked in on a gang rape going in here
---
You need 40.000 silithid carapaces. 
---
If Asmongold manages to mobilize 1000 people grinding in the hives, grinding gold to buy carapaces from other people etc. they are done with the quest lightning fast, open the gong while you just got your Broodlord head.
---
Asmongold earned 10.000$ in *one* event, so him getting carried through various open world content pieces is very possible.
---
Very interesting. This is a major buff to all raid bosses compared to private servers.
---
* 9% more parry = RIP in peace fury tanks.
---
* 9% more parry also means DPS will be capped by threat far quicker, and will have to ramp up slower.
---
* Melee dps will be doing 1-2% less damage due to extra dodge?
---
I am just hoping this means it is possible these private servers also are way off on proc rates... really doesn't make sense that BRE is BiS for warriors until naxx lol
---
because they dont want to invest in the servers.
---
And for the players who wanted their succubus to have a cute pet ;)
---
Got a link to those? 
---
Btw, keep in mind 8% is for yellow hits, not white.
---
I just went to check and its in classic its a level 20 ret talent called pursuit of justice with 2 ranks it gives 8%
---
To piggyback on that, we’ve already seen this bug a thousand times. I think all of the Classic team and most of the community are aware that layering is currently not working as intended.
---
Ain’t that the truth
---
"just start all over again because you got unlucky" is a pants-on-head retarded solution. How people genuinely think Blizzard would go for that for Classic is beyond me. Hence the layering.
---
its not much less threat when you consider the extra rage theyll be getting, and theyd need to be doing like 40% less for aggro to be a real issue with world buffs
---
Because of Resilience, PvP got inaccessible to new players. You either had Res gear or you died instantly.
---
Therefore, everyone who wanted to go into PvP, had to suddenly farm honorpoints while basically being completely useless. Where before you could contribute even if you didn't have the best gear, now there suddenly was a barrier of entry.
---
Honestly... the key system was brutally over the top for the most part and easing up on it was a good idea
---
Yeah, why cant they ask any of Vanilla's devs to confirm or deny these numbers?
---
But remember that every time they expanded and took away flying mounts, there are a lot of upset people. Blizzard said exactly what you say here in their defence but then they were dumb to tell players what they wanted.
---
It gets confusing since they also said we didn't want vanilla. 
---
But I agree, when traveling is an investment, it makes the world seem more alive and my characters existence in it too.
---
They are only top dps (consistently) post AQ40.  
---
Idc how much easier the game will be now, it still takes time to run MC/ony/BWL every week, clear up to cthun (skipping certain side bosses) in AQ40 and then push naxx40.  
---
Point being that naxx40 is a hardcore thing, and this 'issue' is only going to affect a very small percentage of people in the grand scheme of things.
---
I'll take a stab at this one! Haven't spent tons of time outside of the 19 and 29 bracket but I've played all of it at some point
---
* 19 bracket: the ultimate rogue bracket; the gear &amp; twink capability available makes it so that they can one-shot most non-twinks and take out most other twinks with one of the highest dps while still being incredibly tanky - possible HP pools are ridiculous and warriors/paladins/druids don't have their level 40 major armor buffs, so are quite squishy relatively. In this level bracket, all classes run the same speed and there is no mounts so the rogues' stealth is the only way to improve "mobility" where stealth allows initiative of being able to fight on their own terms. Honorable mention: hunters, no mobility between classes vs. hunter's conc shot = hell for the enemy. Weakest class I would guess to be warriors, they lack much of their key abilities and talents at this point (particularly stuff like intercept, mortal strike, etc.)  and overall are essentially Paladins who can't heal or use Hammer of Justice at this rank (though they CAN hamstring, which is nice &amp; useful). (Dis)honorable mention for the "weak class" list would be basically any of the clothy casters - priests, mages, and warlocks all have some of their core abilities like psychic scream, fear, and numerous slows for mages, but they all do not have access to substantial +dmg or +healing gear and so even when twinked they can't easily compete with rogues 
---
* 29 bracket: feral druids; cat form druids are running around with 30% extra move speed while nobody else has always available mobility that isn't either a major liability like aspect of the cheetah or ghost wolf. In this tier, feral druids do very substantial damage (competitive even with rogues in terms of straight DPS), can get their literal level 60 BiS 2h mace (manual crowd pummeler) if they want to wreck face, and like usual can pop in and out of forms for CC mitigation, can pop into bear for durability, can load up HoTs or offheal... Level 29 feral druids are gods of PvP in this tier. Honorable mention: hunters like usual; like druids, one of the few classes with reliable mobility talents at this point, and just as dominant at low-level PvP due to their general oppressiveness. Weakest class: warriors are bad in the 29 bracket for the same reasons they are bad in the 19 bracket. 
---
* 39 bracket: feral druids dominate here for the same reasons they dominated at the 29 bracket. The gap isn't as high here as before as most other "behind" classes are starting to get their full abilities and utility which closes the gap a bit. An example of this is that Warriors now have Intercept, mages are really filling out the frost talent tree and now have excellent talents like Ice Block and Cold Snap, and shamans have Windfury weapon to bring a world of hurt to those that think they're just another squishy. PvP is overall getting more balanced at this point, and it is important to note that the HP pool differences between a full twink to an average player is starting to become much less pronounced. Weakest class: still warriors, just less so
---
* 49 bracket: things are even more balanced, where casters are now starting to get some real +dmg and +healing gear. All classes have access to their 40 point talents (e.g. Mortal Strike for warriors, Soul Link for warlocks, etc.) at this point. Even so, the overall gear available isn't super incredible (the twinks and the normal folk are going to be kitted out in Zul Farrak dungeon gear) &amp; the enchants don't go so far now (100 hp to chest at level 19 was a big deal, not special in this tier though). In this more "balanced" environment, hunters take the stage because they still put out top-tier DPS (it's not until level 60 that this becomes not the case) while having absolute control in a mid-map WSG style fight like usual.  Weakest class: still warriors, but Paladins could arguably suck harder this time! With Mortal Strike &amp; most of their abilities, warriors are extremely deadly in melee... but still can be kited until the end of time. Paladins still don't have a ton of their famed survivability yet (though do have plate gear now) and now are starting to really show their weakness in overall DPS (earlier on, Paladins could do quite relatively strong DPS), though Paladins can heal like usual, which is obviously important
---
* 59 bracket: I can't speak too much for this, but the nature of PvP has changed because you can now be entering Alterac Valley, which tends to become very large scale group fighting. Gear discrepancy between twinks / non twinks in this tier is possibly the highest possible (barring maybe 19 bracket) because there's a lot of gear from pre-raid (and possibly even raids?) that can be gained by level 59. There will be a lot of level 51's doing Alterac Valley for [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7202](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7202), and you will eat them for breakfast. I would imagine that in Alterac Valley, Shamans now are king due to their group healing and group damage ranged powerhouse status, and otherwise hunters dominate in smaller group skirmish fighting in WSG or AB like usual. Honorable mentions are Mages and Warlocks: they've got their full PvP utility and geared Mages will blow things up and geared Warlocks are simply monsters. Weakest class might be Paladins, Warriors, or Druids- Warriors can be VERY strong with huge gear potential in this tier but are CC'able like usual, and Paladins ... now get access to lots of +heal and survivability but still lack flexibility, and finally Druids now are starting to become weaker healers, damagers, and mostly nuisances on the battlefield.
---
* 60 bracket: ehhh Warriors are meme-worthy at this point, a very geared warrior relative to everyone else at level 60 will finally start to become the pvp god that they want to be (assuming they've prayed to the gods and have been blessed with their very own pocket paladin to give out Blessing of Freedom and pocket heals). Druids now kind of suck outside of their general versatility; it's hard to do much damage with druids at level 60 and their healing potential isn't good compared to the other healers - Druids now embody the "annoying gnat" playstyle they're known for, but still are the best flag carriers and are very hard to pin down.
---
OP posted it, it's the 2nd highest reply on the threat ATM.
---
I still have one. 😏
---
People have already named BFA's beta as an example - but that's only because known issues and worries were obviously not addressed despite significant communication.
---
Even if a beta isn't disastrous, it's almost always used as a marketing instrument.
---
I guess I just remember her lifting her fist in the air when the cast to finishes.  I always liked that
---
Made it to level 10. Queues into WSG thinking it would be 10v10 shit show of level 10s from stress test realm. Our team full of level 10s got pub stomped by 19 twinks from the beta server. 10/10 would play again.
---
Fuck anyone that wants the 'authentic experience'. I was there - I know what it was. It was BRILLIANT in 2005/6. 
---
Those people are the vocal minority. Nobody WANTS authentic, everyone WANTS what made Vanilla so great (and nobody can put their finger on it, so they fear that changing anything will spoil it). More than anything what made vanilla great was a sense of community - and the only thing you shouldn't do to make that go away, is make the game easier for people who are too retarded to find people out in the world to help them quest/raid/pvp.
---
So those people that go; Well - 'that's not how it was'... Fuck'em. It's 2019. If you want a time capsule you're yearning for something that doesn't exist anymore. If you want something that's just as good - you're going to need to understand that progress (IN A VERY LIMITED AND ONLY QoL WAY), is inevitable.
---
They have mana issues for people who do not farm, and use on cooldown, Dark Runes as well as every other mana consumable. But even then they just are not optimal. The major problem being you give up like a third of a full healing Priests effectiveness for the Holy Weaver build, but since you effectively get a full DPS slot for doing so, that is an awesome trade. Then even for the raids willing to run one, it should only be one. Out of 40 plus people. TBC really brought Spriest into viability but vanilla.... not so much. Cool idea tho, hopefully it gets tested.
---
Those are not really the same type of examples. The first example is related to the person moving between areas, and being able to return to the area in which the mob exists.
---
In the example in this thread the two players permanently switch layer. This could work as intended, if some players need to be moved to a different layer.
---
This comment confuses me. Frost shock is a really good ability. Hits hard, instant cast, very short CD, and slows the target
---
&gt; scorpids are just relevant for duels. The big mana war is a part of the  long drawn out TBC arena fights. For classic you will spend most of your  time either in WSG or AB. In WSG you want cast pushback to  annoy/compromise casters and in AB it is another 'hidden' source to  interrupt a flag capture even if you end up in crowd control 
---
I didn't think the DOTS applied push back or interrupted flag captures (happy to be proved wrong as would give me a reason to get the scorpids besides them looking cool). I do know they were used to "hide" Vipersting from decurse
---
you could, you know, incest in new hardware instead of this "layering" crap.
---
Seems to me the only solution if this doesn't get fixed is to not invite people and risk being layered lol. Which is the exact opposite of why we want to play classic. Hope blizzard isn't this stupid to let this slide.
---
Yeah this happens all the time, im very experienced with this shit.. :/
---
Storm and Soda literally only go for the flag tho
---
Most people on this sub hate the ever living crap out of retail.  I quit back in cata, but I am not stupid enough to not notice the ridiculous amount of private server elitism going around.
---
Until you play Classic and the BiS gear for your toon is disgusting and doesn't match. You'll like it a lil more then.
---
Is that worth running at lvl 60? Or is it best to get a cat (lose the utility and gain the dps/push back)
---
People tend to het really mad when they a) lose their character names because merges b) suddenly there is an influx of players/huilds on the servet that didn't exist yesterday but are now competing with you
---
I have worked as a software developer for those past 7 years, but nice try.
---
Has nothing to do with tanking strats.  Has more to do with warrior DPS aggro.
---
I can tell by the pixels and from having seen quite a few shops in my day
---
Depending on your class choice, you can only learn certain weapon skills.
---
Depending on your race choice, you'll know at least one skill by default and can learn the rest (that your class is able to learn) from a trainer.
---
Shaman have a talent that allows them to learn Two-Handed Axes and Two-Handed Maces. If you respec, your skill goes back to 0 and you'll have to learn (and train) it all over again.
---
Some races have bonuses to certain weapon types.
---
All weapon skills start at 1. Every time you level up, your maximum skill increases by 5 (up to 300 at 60, unless you're one of the races with a bonus which allows you to go above this).
---
NPC defense is calculated by level * 5. For every point your weapon skill is lower than a monster's defense skill, your chance to miss increases. Your chance to be dodged, parried, and blocked also increases. Your chance to critical strike decreases. Your chance to hit with full weapon damage also decreases (this is called a Glancing Blow).
---
You train weapon skills by using them in combat. Every swing has a chance to increase your skill.
---
In PVP, weapon skill doesn't matter.
---
There are no training dummys in Classic.
---
True. Let's burn all streamers! I'm not going to let some kiddo with a hippy backside cap talking some bullshit in the microphone and jerking off on the camera (and by the way getting thoussnds of hands to help him) ruin my classic experience!
---
I call inquisition.
---
I mean, this is not a bug, this is a feature of the technology.
---
What I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buhe4z/vanilla_wow_feels_like_a_complete_game_with_no/epfl4dk/) but in a much nicer tone, because I agree with you.
---
Fuck time machines. Let's gut Vanilla for everything that made it great, and have it be a massive natural experiment on game design - so that all other studios can look at it and go; "Well, they obviously made one of the greatest games ever if a couple million people go back to a 15 year old game... maybe we should learn from it?"
---
The games industry needs something like this... with all it's shit-stale problems with loot-boxes etc...
---
That's still only for spells.
---
PVE hitcap: 16% (17% but there's 1% that can't be removed)
---
PVP hitcap: 3% (4% but there's 1% that can't be removed).
---
There is no "1% miss chance regardless" for yellow or white hits.
---
been happen since the stress test went live today.  sometimes you can retake the flight and it works. or you can try and alt f4 when you land.  but it will drop you to your death close to the end flight path when you log back in.
---
&gt;if all you wanted to do was hit 60.
---
Did you not read my post, or did you not understand it?
---
In Vanilla, I could reach 60 like this.
---
On live I can reach, kill and get rewards from what the game presents as endgame content.
---
Sorry, I won't discuss strawman arguments here.
---
&gt; Too bad that expansion was about pandas and WoW's edgelord 
---
\*Too bad WoW *suddenly aped kungfu panda* instead of staying true to their lore
---
Yea.. wrath really trivialized tanking.
---
I think if it has any effect at all it will just make classes with a threat dump (rogue, hunter) more desirable. If threat is a problem then recruiting more rogues and hunters makes more sense than recruiting boomkin or retadins.
---
Or.. you can just roll on a server without streamers.
---
&gt; You have to be a virgin trying hard to prove how manly you are 
---
They ripped off kung fu panda you dumb alpha manlet.
---
I think worth noting that hunter dps starts off great in first raid or two but doesn’t get dramatically better. So you’ll not see the same gains as a mage for example based on gear upgrades. You always need a couple of hunters in a raid for tranq amongst other things though
---
Not caring about a multi-billion dollar company, that shit on the vanilla players for the last 10 years isnt exactly acting like a child. You're just a bootlicker.
---
first off miss and resist arnt the same thing even on casters, if its HIT based then its a white word if its resisted then its yellow and they both say resist.
---
but theres no 1% miss chance on attacks or spells in pve its pvp only
---
Sure, all those after the rogue opens you. Didn't say sit and die, but track hidden was borderline useless, and you would never run through contested areas without track humanoids on anyways.
---
God I used this for a LONG time
---
Yes using lower rank spells. If you always use the max rank heals you will go oom fast. Healing is a fun game of guessing who is going to get hit and for how much which determines which rank of heal you use. I enjoyed it a lot, but this go around I will not have nearly the time I did, so its Hunter for me.
---
You know you made a mistake, own it.
---
What event am I missing? Are people keeping their characters once classic releases? Doubtful.
---
What if I like telling people to min max?  
---
Better idea is that people shouldn't let words discourage them so much.  If someone tells them they should do something a certain way, then it is up to that individual to simply make a decision to either heed or ignore the advice and do what they want.  
---
Life is full of dickwads.  Deal with it and move on.
---
Well, I guess being butt buddies with the warlocks could be fun. Vampiric Embrace is actually capable of decent healing for the SP's group. And since Warlock's lifetap a lot using Vampiric Embrace when they do should pretty heavily increase their DPS while letting healers focus on other stuff.
---
Who cares if you're server first 60?
---
I loved having the mallet. I felt important, lol.
---
Thank you
---
Private servers  don't have the correct values that's why they play it safe by overtuning everything. And the private server community appreciates the increased difficulty.
---
I raided through AQ40 (not cthun sadly) and a little bit into naxx40 as arms and was top DPS on most fights.   Most guilds aren't going to give a flying crap if you can justify your spot in the raid with higher DPS.
---
Also PSA. I don’t know why but I absolutely can’t stand people doing PSA. They’re almost always incredibly dumb and at best something slightly unknown but only because people don’t care about that thing.
---
This isn't a bug, this is how the code for layering works at a fundamental level and would require several hundred hours of coding, meetings, and planning to fix. This will not be fixed.
---
Actually, a lot of streamers are intentionally NOT announcing what server they're on until launch (most of us will be choosing a realm and making 3 characters 2 weeks before launch).
---
While this means a lot of kids won't be able to pre-make characters to follow their streamers, it also means guilds with launch day plans won't be able to avoid them. The lid is off shortly after launch day though.
---
Also, you're not going to get server first 60 if you don't play 24 hours a day until you're 60. There are teams of players planning to take turns.
---
Popular kids are always gonna be popular. Just gonna have to get over it.

Someone posted on on r/wow they got 15 or so. Wasn't too long ago.
---
They should sacrifice every blizzard dev who cheered for the 'you do want it but you dont' comment at the release of Classic.
---
Pretty sure VE takes up a debuff slot, which means you won’t be allowed to use it.
---
I keep seeing people mention this, but I was in a serious guild back then as an arms warrior (PvE build) and topped meters on most fights in AQ40 and the couple we killed in naxx.  
---
Yea, the debuff slot is unfortunate, but if I am 5-10% above most other people.. then I have to imagine that one slot is made up for in the grand scheme of things.
---
You literally have no idea how Twitch works lol
---
Do you really think the higher ups at Blizzard would ever allow the devs to go ahead and launch the game full knowing that most players will be unable to complete a single quest upon making a character, probably after waiting several hours in a queue? On K3 launch I had to grind two levels by killing two scorpids over and over again in a little opening behind Razor Hill. Basically every other mob in the zone was tagged as soon as it spawned in.

---
I was in this game. I am kpkp. I was sweating real hard because yeah we almost lost with 3 level 19s lmao
---
The main issue for classes like Spriests is the debuff limit in raids. There are so many beneficial debuffs on the target that dots don't get a priority. Also with things like (shadow weaving?), spriests bring utility to raids but the raid only needs one.
---
Still one of the best open world pvp trinkets because it lets you run down anyone who isn’t using it.
---
The first 4 skill points give 0.4% each, the 5th gives 1.4%.
---
Past 305 every additional skill point gives 0.1% hit. The 0.04% value is versus players only.
---
Damn, that's a wrench in the works. Thought it was a buff on the priest. Shame, would be a decent way to have shadow priest support and dps at the same time (doing meh at both admittedly). A damn shame cause i really wanna play shadow priest but the more research I do the more worthless they seem for raids.
---
Which if you’re trying to open world gank people, it’s a pretty nice to be faster than anyone who doesn’t have it.

Winning a match rewards 3x Marks of Honor for that BG, 1 for a lose. Cash in 3 for bonus rep and honor.
---
Accumulate honor for the week to gain rank. Depending on your rank 1-14, you can buy items with gold. Each BG has a rep vendor as well with rewards you can buy with gold.
---
The problem is that it doesn't increase the difficulty. So they may think it's more difficult but it only appears more difficult. These common misconceptions is a good reason not to prioritize pserver players.
---
Your post lacks a lot of coherency, you talk about exclusivity breeding desire to raid and want to progress, yet you also are praising 10man LK and saying it was an accomplishment for many.
---
multi-difficulty raiding is what removed exclusivity, LFR may be the final form of it, but 10man raiding was what started it. 10man LK was laughably easier than 10man heroic, 25man or 25man heroic but it gave people access to the boss without having to put in the work to do the harder difficulties thus removing exclusivity. 
---
Multi-tiered raiding also opens up a whole mess of balancing issues which you actually talked about but then proceeded to say that it should remain. having 10man and 20man would be equivalent to adding another difficulty level to mario.
---
Have more realms and merge them if pop drops. You don't need layering to solve this. Layering is blizz way of saving money.
---
NO ACHIEVEMENT? PLZ SEND COPY OF BIRTH CIRTIFICATE TO PROVE ELIGABILITY
---
And that, kids, is why we don't raid with shadow priests.

Spells that miss are shown as being resisted.

Mmm, in reality the "rest of you" would be forced in a queue for a few days as the devs have said that they will try to make fewer servers (despite the massive influx of players) so that servers don't end up half-dead in a couple of months.
---
Warriors should be taking 1 handers, not 2 handers as dual wield Fury is the best Warrior DPS spec. if a Warrior gets a weapon over a Ret Paladin it's for PVP which won't benefit your raids progression at all.

I really enjoy mythic raids. Knowing that me and my 19 guildies are progressing through a raid the average player can’t do.
---
The best feelings in wow I’ve had for a while is when you clear mythic in a decent time before the next tier and your guild didn’t fall apart and die before you cleared.
---
Honestly, if you’re set on the whole shadowmage type class, roll a demo Warlock, you can sac your pets for buffs and do shadow damage, and get yourself geared and do really good DPS as well as offer some utility.
---
SC2 did have uncapped fps, but all it did was bring to attention that people with shitty GPUs that could throttle themselves properly. It was never SC2's fault. If you GPU has a meltdown by going all out and thereby kills itself it you should be giving the company who made your GPU a call..
---
Theres still an active private server afaik
---
Yes, they stack.
---
Thx, just wanted conformation.
---
Did you get everyone to jump simultaneously ala that classic video of gnomes in the AH?
---
Maybe they do, I don't watch their streams.  I was more making a comment about the huge influx of Druids.  Always talked about as the least played class and I've got a feeling that's no longer true on some servers come Classic launch.
---
Druid is a very difficult class to play and I expect less than 10% of them will be anything but a free honor kill.
---
The only reason I think scaling is fine for retail is because there are so many problems with retail WoW, that the scaling is the least of my worries.

I think some proc weapons are considered spells so your spellpower would enhance those procs while scratching boss as a kitty. It's probably not max DPS but it's a cute concept.

You can also just grab this quest staff with +29 spirit ( http://classicdb.ch/?item=15854 ) and enchant it with +20 spirit more with Mighty Spirit for a regen stat stick to get your mana back faster.

Don’t play on a server that: Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Shroud, Lirik, Esfand/tipsout/and co. Are all on. A streamer with &gt;1000 viewers will not disrupt your server, so not much to worry about, there. 
---
There will be 3 classes of streamers, A) too big to play PvP. B) pvp and announcing server C) PvP and mum on server choice.
---
You really only need to be worried about big names who are option C. 
---
My biggest fear, is reserving the 4 letter name I’ve had since Vanilla, login play to 10-15 and take my first break, pop open a stream to find soda rolled on my server—where my name is saved—and he didn’t say he was going there prior. 
---
I’m actually fairly excited to see what streamers cook up to keep them, their server and their chat entertained. And I’m totally okay watching it all from my 2nd monitor. 
---
What I find interesting is to a degree the server celebrity thing existed in Vanilla. However in Vanilla you got famous for being good, playing a lot, or making videos. Streamers don’t necessarilly have of those traits, yet they’ve got a gaggle of people following them regardless. Nothing disparaging, it’s just interesting that from moment 1 asmongold will the most known person on his server. 
---
Nihilum themselves could come back with Kungen as MT and just shatter every speed run record and they wouldn’t have as much notoriety as asmon will have at level 1. 
---
What I’ve also noticed, is how excluded one feels listening to their streams of the beta when you are on beta but not playing with them. It isn’t their fault, but it comes off to me, at least, as them just being “the cool kids” with the server and those on it as nothing more than props for their entertainment, be it fodder for hks or drones to help them with anything. 
---
I was grinding some shit in ashenvale, no streamers for miles, but I had someone’s stream on in the background, so I knew there was a mass PvP battle in northern duskwood. Nothing about it in world, world defense, looking for group or general. Without that stream, which was essentially 1 way discord access, I’d have never known, but cause I did I was missing out. 
---
Idk, none of my friends have beta, maybe why that makes me salty? When I can form a ubrs group or wsg team with nothing but the people I’ve been playing games with for the last...decade...maybe then it won’t matter.
---
Tl;dr I’m very concerned with the “drone effect” with streamers, even more concerned with wasting my name reservation on a server a big time stream is secretly going to.
---
&gt;  Layering kicked in, and the Horde ended up on another layer, so the Horde's army ran right past the Alliance's army
---
Well thats one way to kill vanilla.
---
Get a baby carrier and a yoga ball. Works really well keeping baby calm/putting baby to sleep for the first 6 months, and you can work on your posture while gaming. Win/win.
---
Be glad you will even get it tbh.. most people still going to have to pay full price for theirs.
---
Bottom line is that the average leveling time was between 240-300 hours depending on class.  You could likely lower that a little bit if you did absolutely nothing else but quest (no profession focus, light AH visits, minimal dungeon runs.. if any, etc.).
---
Planning on playing 10-12 hours a day?  Even then you are still looking at about a month.  If you lower that to something like 5~ hours a day, then it starts going up to around 2 months or more.  
---
Point being, you wont be waiting nearly as long as you think, or at least the majority wont be.
---
I will also be playing with a fellow heeler.
---
that's probably what i'll have to do. A shame cause i rather like to shadow priests kit and special snowflake-ness. But that debuff limit is a right serious thorn in the side.
---
Man I'm making faces at my monitor. I think you've got an inaccurate perception about why people had a problem with the tone of that expansion. As this appears to be a case of emotions superseding facts, I'll dip out with gentle disagreement.
---
Everyone who knew how to make games is long gone from Blizzard now, our only hope is rectifying the good ones.
---
Yes, Heirlooms came out in WotLK.  They were also much more limited than their current iteration.
---
I remember a gnome that would spam /train in bgs ever since then I’ve wanted every gnome I’ve ever seen to get ganked, camped until they log, camped when they log back in, and camped until they delete the character. I fucking hate gnomes so much.
---
#ANYONE ELSE WANT OP TO SHUTTUP???? xD
---
Their lore, which literally had brewmaster monks since WC2?  
---
Their lore, which specifically referenced Chen, the Brewmaster Monk Panda from Pandaria, in a [Barrens quest from Vanilla?] (https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=4926)  
---
And who gives a fuck, dude? Thrall was straight-up inspired by Moses. WoW's lore has hardly been the most compelling part of the gameplay. Vanilla's especially. If you have such a boner for lore, how can you love Vanilla where we're just straight up given corrupted ashbringer and that had to be retconned?  
---
They could've stolen the lore directly from Little Red Riding Hood for an entire expansion and if the systems/balance/gameplay/raids/content were as good as they were in MoP I'd be singing them praises.  
---
So whether you want me to dismiss you as an edgelord, dismiss you as some kind of weird casual loser who cares more about sprites than gameplay, or dismiss you as a general retard.. take your pick, dog.
---
Dude who cares? Streamers are free advertising for the game and could make it even more popular than it already will be. There's no need to be so up in arms about not hitting 60 first. Just enjoy the game
---
#Accuracy level: 99/100
---
ENFP I've always been a mage or rogue, but i 've been doing the mage thing for a while so we're going back to rogue
---
MFW vanilla pal
---
Funny you bring this up, I did 6 on a nelf on my way to Elwynn and was wondering what the highest ever was
---
That's how almost all games are played at the competitive level. Look at portal speed runs.
---
And it is nowhere near as graphically advanced as current singleplayer games, let alone cinematics. 
---
No, fancy shaders and oversaturated colors don't constitue as good or advanced graphics. That's simply a stylistic choice.
---
Your body size hasn't changed in 14 years? This is mildly alarming.
---
I had a tshirt with printed on it a screenshot of my level 16 female tauren hunter 😎, I don't think you can beat that.
---
&gt;The possibilities are endless!
---
Ironic but Vanillas choices *ARE endless* compared to [BIS] [Half Bis] [Garbage Tier] of live.
---
Hate the title. Layering is suppose to keep you in the layer for an entire play session. So if something like this is happening its not intentional
---
It's been tested in the beta? Private servers could be wrong
---
Ret isn't the Paladin dueling spec.  You've got a lot to learn.
---
Scaling is a genius way to let you completely finish a zone without gimping your leveling speed. It does worsen the enjoyment when you do it multiple times, but you can level like 4 characters to 60 in completely different zones.
---
The main problem comes with BC and Wrath, where the beginner zones are way too boring after these years for me. Maybe not for Grizzly Hills. That is awesome. Because of bears. Bears are awesome. 
---
Why would you come back later, as in a few levels? Streamlined quests, reduced xp requirements and heirloom killed it, because you outleveled anything in a few quests time. The "bad" vanilla design forced the players to revisit zones, because there weren't enough quests to level up constantly. Terribly ineffective, but an immensly RPG like element, which feels hell a lot better than the handholding of later expansions.
---
Plus you still need around 500g.  He would not only have to spend 10-15 hours a day for this to a point of contention, but he would need to spend all of his post 60 time gold making instead of dungeon running. 
---
Plus there will be virtually no gold in the economy at this point, so the majority of the gold we would be earning in the first phase, would be physical, new gold entering the game that we create ourselves.  That makes things take a lot longer than he might think.
---
bok tho
---
Even in Hungary we have guilds (not one!), who raided 7x8-10 hours in vanilla and bc.
---
throwing knife specilization
---
But it’s not. In fact, this is what layering is *supposed* to prevent.
---
Has nothing to do with private servers. They stacked in Vanilla.
---
But yes, it's been tested in the Beta.
---
Woah that sound nice, feels bad i didnt have a clue about this. Thank you
---
I mean, the warlock quest mount still needs around 500g anyway right?
---
and battle for cuckzaroth only has *3* options per class now.
---
Some guy did a breakdown on the retail forums a while ago, as I said.  It got a lot of attention at the time.  As I said, they were just estimates, and my percentages were just estimates.
---
I get what you're saying... but...
---
PoE has suffered greatly from power creep. Especially in terms of how it's constantly been pushed toward a speed clear meta because of this creep.
---
On top of that, new content also has creep in terms of generally more ridiculous and op (relative to prior seasons) itemsation.
---
PoE hasn't broken the mould in that regard at all.
---
What makes PoE so successful is the same concept as how we see interest peak every time a new private server came out.
---
That being seasons. The pushing for ranks or just the fresh economy to trade in etc - as well as the new skills / items to play with and so on.
---
But I just don't see that type of reset being of interest to people in an MMO like wow.
---
Not only is the time investment to lvl etc vastly different, but in PoE the VAST majority of people quit very soon after a league starts after playing their fill, and then come back next league or the league after that.
---
It's a different type of game, and seasonal resets just wouldnt work for a game like WoW. 
---
But yeah - the main thing is that item and power crep and bigger numbers ARE a thing in PoE. And they ARE a problem too, unless you really like the speed clear meta.
---
Enhancement is still a solid pvp spec, it's just not the one shot wonder like people seem to think it is
---
When I look at bfa gear you see the problem with transmogs: they don‘t care anymore because everyone is using transmogs anyway
---
If hitting dc issues still, head to eastern kingdom. I was dc'ing for 3 hours, finally used about 8 disconnects to make my way to Menethil harbor. Didn't dc after that.
---
Good perspective, thank you. Still locking layers could allow you to search for other players, but not see them or group with them. I still think no layers is better.
---
my guild tapped out at huhuran when TBC launched
---
we dont even need lfr with good 10 mans lmao
---
tbh if blizz announced WoW classic: Ulduar as the first expansion I wouldnt even be mad...
---
Literal goosebumps.
---
Do you have any evidence of that beside some nonsense blizzard talks about?
---
it's 2019 and there are still world of warcraft players who have no idea what parry does and melee should hit big the big red from behind  
---
amazing
---
With that being said Ill bring a couple stacks for when hunters run out in my group lol.
---
It does, it is a frelling pain in the arse, which is exactly why people were up in arms about it when they admitted to wanting to use it in Classic. Then they said they would not, but would use something called layering that supposedly is completely different, but from the perspective of someone just playing looks to have the *exactly* same issues... At this point, all I can say that the *second* I witness something like this when Classic is finally live, I'll cancel my sub. For good.
---
but, r/classicwow told me you can only roll Dwarf Priest. ^^^/s
---
As user Labubs once said:
---
&gt; Piss off bot
---
And low level rogues 1-shotting anyone with ambush up to level 70.
---
cant run sfk at 20. boss is 26 you would miss all your attacks
---
I'm not saying crit resistance is a bad stat, just that ever inflation of crit for the player and crit resistance would be dumb. 
---
The rating system is also dumb but achieves it in a slightly better/smoother fashion. 
---
And yeah resilience was a stat in TBC to like Cata. It did different things at times and one of them was crit resistance.
---
You dont think that happens through out the whole game? farming is valuable at many points in the game and sometimes the spawns are few and far between. That is how MMOs work. If you didnt have to fight for resources it would be a single player game, hence BFA... funny how that works.
---
I believe gear score started out as an addon which gained mass popularity, so don't get your hopes up just yet!
---
Heres advice, bave a friend or 2 Come to your place and farm/level your character when you sleep. Also make sure to do min 30hr on release and 24hr after that with 3-4 hr sleep break.
---
If You can find People to grind pots for you that would be ideal.
---
With a small help from Friends during 3 hr sleep break youll get miles ahead since your chart is playing literally 24/7.
---
After 2,3 days youll get more tired and at that point start playing your planned 18 hrs.
---
Take powernaps when on flight paths or crafting a lot. 5 min naps are life saver. 
---
To close it with this, dont even think about speed leveling efficiently or at all if You didn't go over the routes yourself min twice. 
---
You have to know every quest to really speed level.
---
Or the first time you heard west fall music. Nostalgia is so weird. Sadness combined with happiness.
---
Yep. If you trained a pet recently and just go get it killed a bunch it's not happy and abandons you lol. 
---
Serves ya right letting the poor creature die imo :D one of the many little things that are so damn good about vanilla.
---
*THIS* is the video that made you want to play WoW, which you knew nothing about... why? Those numbers would mean nothing to you. Nor would the boss name. The camera angle is as if he dropped his phone on the floor and forgot he was recording.
---
I don't really understand why people want to play with Asmongold, Esfand, Staysafe, Tipsout, etc...  
---
I mean, I like to watch their stream once in a while. But I don't give a single flying fuck about them.  
---
Do the people wanting to absolutely play on their servers  have a low IQ?
---
Warlock soley based on the fact that you were interested in a hunter and Warlocks have also have pets so its basically the best of both worlds.
---
Have you ever been to the forge in deadmines and not wiped at least once? 
---
They call it slaughter forge
---
&gt; Why are they used to that?
---
You get what you pay for. And since Blizzard does not pay their Beta testers, but has them pay for the privilege of even being considered for Beta access, Blizzard get what they pay for: People playing instead of testing.
---
You're issue is you watch streams
---
Its not a bug its how their technology works. It's the exact same thing as BFA.
---
I myself don't want them touching anything as far as the initial wave of content up to Naxx goes, but I agree: the #NoChanges crowd are a bunch of sweaty waste dumps who personify that 30-Year-Old Boomer meme to the letter. 
---
Games that were made for a 2004 server architecture are gonna perform the same way 15 years later. And nobody wants that. *obligatory "You think you do..."*
---
Uh, yeah. All of those things you've nit-picked are the reasons I wanted to play. Because it looked fucking cool.
---
They do stack giving that neither gets knocked off at the debuff cap.
---
Well that's where I can view classic so. It's the only accurate information I have :D
---
I almost feel like you’re a troll.. “layering for months”. Nothing has changed since they have announced it. It never went from “days” to “months”.  You’re just reaching for something to complain about. You legit said you’d rather be stabbed in the eye with needles than have sharding. Come on man. There just isn’t strong enough server infrastructure to handle a launch the size of what classics will be, period. Have you been on the stress tests? It’s obvious a temporary solution is needed for launch and layering is that.
---
As an old hardcore raider i think raiding died in wotlk. My first steps in naxx and sunwell felt more special than to kill LK25HC. I quit wow after that. 
---
And the casual raiders had a lot of content in Vanilla and TBC but a casual raider shouldnt have access to the hardest and newest raid.
---
Layering doesn't solve the play cycle.
---
Layering isn't going to make classic servers any less dead after a year of the last release. People play through the content, then wait for a fresh reset and release.
---
Private servers aren't dead for lack of layering, they just got played through the cycle and everyone is waiting on the next fresh release (bliz servers)
---
I’ve never seen a few of these bosses? Who’s miner Johnson and the undead zombie
---
It’s an indirect buff to feral tank if warrior tank is weaker
---
How would you feel if Blizzard introducing self contained expansions? Maybe based on a different time period? All previous characters left in the dust.
---
It’s really hard to imagine there are many good ones left. They can remake a game they’ve already made, but can Blizzard ever actually release an independent game like D2 or classic again? I really don’t think their company functions in a way that lets them take those kinds of risks anymore.
---
I was unsubbed for all of 2 months from 11/23/04 through 11/23/14, no statue after the 10 year. 
---
Between being bummed about that and how horrible WoD was after I found out I couldn’t just not have a garrison (and be a hardcore progression raider) caused me to quit the game.
---
 Didn’t come back till ass end of legion, thought—I mean it’s not amazing, but it’ll do—then bfa...couldn’t even make it a month. Though I did resub right before beta was announced. Blizzard finally did me a solid and tossed me access day 1.
---
Same here but the wait was killing me so I caved to the private server but had an idea. I think I'll just crawl my way up In levels until it releases, really taking my time, reading quests, just taking it all in. 
---
Then when its finally released I'll be able to just power through the quests so I'm not 2 months late to level cap like always haha.
---
WC was a joke. 2 membet DC and we went on clearing the whole thing anyway
---
Guy must be trolling, it’s wild
---
It l could be a. It was large on him to begin with and he just grew into it b. He was already at an age where he hit is max growth spurt
---
So the game's been out for two years with thousands of better produced videos released and you missed all of them only to stumble on this piece of garbage? I don't believe you.
---
It's no mechanic tho. It's nothing but an artificial hardware limitation.
---
Basically every boss in uber's requires you to kill a dickload of mobs before killing boss
---
It's 100% true to it's original form. They found their old files in their repository. They're rebuilding it with modern client because otherwise they can't tie it into their modern blizzard systems which is 100% necessary for it to be able to do.
---
Gave a level 5 undead warrior a green 2h axe I found.. feelsgoodman
---
Personally I love to farm transmog and mounts but at the same time I think it's objetively better for the game to not have it so that you can see what players are wearing etc. It improves the rpg feel and immersion
---
The entire point of layering is that you and everyone on the layer exist in the same world. Why would inviting someone on the same layer causing a mob to despawn be an intended feature lol
---
Made me giggle nice one
---
Only other thing to say is AB does have an ending. Unless no one on either team ever caps a flag and all stay grey, eventually someone will win.
---
As you say, wsg and at can go on forever.
---
Nope, Blizzard's made it clear they don't want this.
---
The API is a modified version of Retail's.
---
..one is magical, blue outline, one is a curse, purple outline.
---
I thought they said in the blue post about beta and stress testing that you needed an active sub?
---
Truly is the worst part about no changes crowd.
---
&gt;Spells that miss are shown as being resisted
---
both resists and misses are labeled as resist on the UI, hence why they have different colors.
---
It's still DM though :)
---
I saw casual discussion about dual wield tanking too and I can only imagine how much this would obliterate it.
---
I'm sorry you're angry. I would offer a hug but I'm pretty sure you'd find some reason to hate on that too.
---
I doubt anybody is goin to styck on MC for long. Even back in 2009 it was  puggable joke even among fresh startup realms
---
Yeah I mean it depends, if you have a guild full of scrubs who can't beat an arms warrior then yeah maybe you're carrying them and don't need to respec.
---
I think the people funding the creation of the game want players to actually be able to play it at launch, and "playing the game" doesn't mean running around Durotar for hours searching for a single boar to kill. Farming valuable mobs is obviously part of the game, but you don't think that is taking it too far?
---
They couldn't find it. And then they found it.
---
It's like when you lose your keys.
---
"We had the original 1.12 client and server and data. But they were designed to run on hardware that hasn’t existed for a long time"
---
"What if we took our modern client, our modern server architecture and instead taught them to speak the original 1.12 data? Rather than working forwards, what if we took what we have now, trying to kind of interpret what was there back then." - Ion Hazzikostas

---
See I always transmogged down when I played in Cata. The lower level gear was more visually appealing to me.
---
Transmogging is one of those things that I love having for myself, but don't like other people having. And yes I know how silly that sounds. Seeing other players in the gear they actually have is cool. But I selfishly want to control my own appearance.
---
If you roll a priest or paladin, go Dwarf female with the long twin braids, those swooping around on their own while casting looks awesome.
---
Ah yeah I remember now. Offensive casting is the same (hands by sides) but she thrusts a hand forward upon spell completion.
---
Ah yeah it's cost savings for business, reduced infrastructure expenditure, so good luck getting Bobby Kottick to spend a dime on that, second and third yachts don't grow on trees, you know.
---
My old leveling guild did it as a big event one night. Was one of those magical experiences I still remember to this day :)
---
Thats what they said, but thats not how BFA works. Easy explanation, they are just lying about it.
---
20-29 lock and rogue twinks checking in. I fucking LOVED twink bgs
---
Pretty cringeworthy lol.
---
I remember this happening to me in vanilla
---
Its pretty much like standing in the fire.
---
MC always stayed relevant because Bindings of the Windseeker were always sought after, even in Naxx days. BWL, Reju gem, Neltharion's tear, lok'amir il romathis, some t2 setbonuses, same, always useful even in T3. AQ40 Jom Gabbar, Dark Edge, Death's Sting, the quest turnin weapons. AQ20 skill books, ZG Class Trinkets, best leg enchants in game.  
---
It was **very** smart design, how certain loot pieces were never power crept on, not even multiple tiers later.
---
Depends on your class really. For some classes (such as priest) this is true, for others (such as Paladins) it's not.
---
You’re going off TBC stuff, which is automatically invalidated as 2.0 introduces changes to weapon skill look at the start of the comments the one by assassinet.
---
I forget the exact scenario, but they ended up finding some old backup files that contained the database, client and server code for 1.12 in its entirety, more or less.
---
you are exaggerating how launch will be. plenty of people got level 5 during the stress test. after the first 3 days it will be fine. maybe some quests will take longer but it wont take you even an hour to get level 5.
---
Also i hope it will increase massively dmg into tanks, on nostalrius people were useing 1.3 speed dagger, recently some tanks used to dual-wield, so idea of haveing  perma frenzied bosses seems fun to me. Perhaps now sword and board gonna be a proper way to play as tank.
---
*paladin enters the chat*
---
Guilds for one. Buying early gear for progression is big money especially depending on server population since things like devilsaur spawns are finite.
---
Pic !
---
You also have to understand that a white hits and special hits were different rolls too.  The 8.6 could easily be special hits.
---
Careful, you're not allowed to say anything about BFA is good around here.
---
&gt; No normal player can compete for the scarab lord title
---
Doesn't exist in Vanilla anyways, but the mount sure looks super nice.
---
You are missing the point of a "stress test".
---
I'm not angry, I just don't believe you.
---
This is like saying you became a fan of the NHL by watching a little kid's street hockey game through a busted telescope.
---
I see well ty for the info might be the challenge I'm looking for.
---
It's basically what I did. Invited some people, did some objectives. Left the group. Joined a new group. Repeated everything until I completed them. Also chatted with some folk. There's some nice people in the stress test.
---
Just like it was on retail classic. That's what you get with spellbatching and it's perfectly fine if you are #nochange.
---
It won't break the game but be a nice niche mechanic if you know what you'r doing.
---
I really hope they don't artificially patch it out.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqjz7e/-/eo5am9d
---
That's true Haha! But now that I know warlocks are kinda smooth brain gameplay I might play a healer.
---
In the beginning there was probably some streamer or content creator who didn't know what they were talking about (shocking I know). And after awhile a term of coined and more and more people parrot said term.
---
Oh no, it's a lost troll. Someone call the children daycare in Sen'Jin.
---
The world got used. The usage stuck. That's how language works.
---
Posture, shoulder pad size, casting animations are the only criteria. 
---
Horde side, the only acceptable caster options are fem orc, fem troll, m undead. Imo fem troll is best looking priest, fem orc for lock, and m undead for mage (priest also acceptable). M UD warlock is so...basic.
---
For alliance, we can just end the conversation at fem dwarf and fem human
---
(As a rule of thumb casters should be female, men don’t wear dresses) 
---
For melee—warriors especially—The shoulder pad thing is the reverse. [male] Orcs and Tauren look dank af. Everything male but gnomes in their entirety are good looking for alliance warriors. Dwarves should never be rogues. Nelfs can go either way on rogues and druids. Warriors should be males.
---
Tbh, hunters—like their taste for weapons—are allowed any and all combos. That’s just the way it is.
---
Obviously all of that is just my personal character creation convention.
---
Classic good retail bad. Do ye ever get tired of these posts?
---
Tipsout said in a video 9-10ppl had told him they got beta without active sub. Though Blizzard has said themselves you need to be subbed to get invited
---
Dropped ma pants
---
Bolvar just covered his eyes, thinking he again accidentally walked on Lady Prestor changing.
---
I like transmog tbh but won’t miss them in classic. 
---
As for heirlooms, I feel they ruined the levelling experience as any items you gain in your journey are meaningless.
---
citation needed
---
So you think raiding died in wotlk but you also quit in wotlk? Well I quit in cataclysm so maybe that's when raiding died
---
I was excited 7 years ago when I realized my pos 2004 base model potato could run a free, awesome game hosted on a private server. I was even a tad excited when blizz announced their classic servers, then I download retail and my comp cant run it and they announce shutting down existing private servers. Not too stoked anymore lol. Guess it will be nice getting outside again ^^
---
And then run into a streamer decked out in gear days after hitting 60 (let’s say everyone passes all loot to him, grinds mats for crafted gear, daily cd’s etc however unrealistic that is) in the cross realm BG’s :D
---
The word isn't a description as much as it is a derogatory term. Its origin isn't meant to be accurate but to be insulting. They aren't lazy as much as they are ignorant.
---
Because it was used often on pservers and it stuck.
---
Ho no, another bad word :(
---
Or maybe just organize the pvp battles daily on the forum. The classic servers will have a forum attached so it shouldn't be a problem
---
Siegszug, Shaman, I quit when TBC started left the server with Liminal and a friend of ours from our wicked tempest days. Soches. I remember you Citgo, druid right?
---
&gt; It also causes redundancy for raiders progressing through raid 1-1,raid-1-2,raid 1-3.
---
This just isn't the case at all though.
---
On live if you're a mythic raiding guild you do the following:
---
Heroic 2 weeks - week 1 - progress / week 2 speed clearing - Mythic isnt out yet.
---
Week 3 - Either you're speed clearing for loot or its now and off day raid and you're progressing mythic
---
After a couple more weeks you're probably not bothering with heroic that much.
---
The notion that you're grinding 4 difficulties of raids or whatever is silly and just wrong.
---
As a mythic raider lfr and normal and even heroic to an extent could not exist and i'd (lfr/normal) not notice at all or only slightly notice due to gear progression (heroic). 
---
&gt;Once you killed Xavius, why would you care to kill Xavius +1? 
---
Because Xavius +1 and Xavius are generally very different fights.
---
Mythic vs heroic has generally far more mechanics that change how the fight looks / plays and how it needs to be approached.
---
Also, as I said, you're only really progressing Xavius for like 1 night on heroic anyway. So it's not like you just spent 400 pulls on it. 
---
&gt;The entire raid of molten core was simpler and more boring than a single trash mob of emerald nightmare, but it drove people to run it significantly more than EN
---
Yes, but there are/were also lots of difficulties with guilds on multiple tiers - if you didn't manage a guild you might not have encountered how much of a pain in the ass it was to recruit/manage a guild that isnt running the top tier content. Especially since every time you get a boss down / major milestone players tended to get poached to a guild a tier up.
---
I did love ulduar, i think everyone did. But it really sounds like the loot drives you...
---
The vast majority of people on live mythic raid because they enjoy the challenging boss fight. The loot is whatever really. You get the loot to do the bosses, but its the bosses you care about.
---
Blizzard specifically stated the debuff limit was a technical one of the day, and they are going to leave it at 16 for recreation purposes.
---
Not sure which patch but Naxx wasnt out while we were raiding this. This thing is so old it's an automatic reupload from Google Video before it shut down. On a side note seeing my old ugly cow with his quell serrar brings back the fondest memories.
---
For Azeroth!!!
---
They get to one-shot me in cross realm BG’s before normal players get to one shot me :(
---
Me!

---
Heirlooms, I fully agree, Transmogs can serve their purpose though. As noted below, there is some really, really ugly gear that is best in slot, you don't want to look at that 24/7. Otherwise: Some people always collected to look different: I had a the HC Paladin armor set during TBC (complete with Kara hammer and shield), and only changed during heroics/raids to normal gear, it was amusing to get quite a few whispers "you do know that gear isn't good for you??". And no worries! I picked it all up when there was no-one interested!
---
Also, I did enjoy still being able to use my rank 10 looks while making a short return during WoD, seeing you couldn't get it any more.
---
Absolute bullshit. It was possible because spellbatching "found a way" around the fixing of "crits while sitting activating abilities".
---
Either you want spellbatching removed or this to stay in.
---
I know that they are going back to spell batching.  I don’t remember the specific term for it was but - essentially let’s say two warriors charging one another or two mages sheeping one another - in current BFA settings only one warrior will get the charge off and same with mage - only 1 sheep.  
---
They are returning to classic batching so with the same instance - if two warriors cast charge - they will end up in each other’s spots. And both mages would be sheeped.
---
Retail can mean a bunch of different things. Often the term wholesale is a marketing thing. Retail to me is paying a regular price for a product or service. I believe they provide both and you pay for them. It's not uncommon for a version of anything to develope nick names over time either. That's why u get vanilla. Classic. Tbc, etc. People will refer to playing retail 5 years ago. Means they paid for the real shit back then.
---
Now you have any current version of the game called retail to difference it from any other version.
---
Anyone have a clip of Esfand's pov of this?
---
The community could just agree to not acknowledge any server firsts done by streamers?
---
I am afraid of asking my girlfriend if i can take off one week and enjoy the nostalgic ride . Our baby will be 5 month around that time. I think about inviting her to a trip to her best girlfriend or parents in this very week.
---
8% is hit cap. Your numbers are from pservers. Actual numbers for weapon skill in vanilla is uncertain.
---
Well if you follow this definition, the classic "2 mages sheeping each other" and shit is also a bug.
---
These are things resulting from the slow batching system.
---
if they dont want to get stream sniped, stop streaming then. they get so much for free but when it comes to the downside of streaming they are complaining. mimimimimiimimimi
---
Love the justifications
---
Don't forget the luffa!
---
I see retail as basically just a complicated excel spreadsheet with some pretty graphics
---
Nope. You guys playing bfa can keep playing bfa, thanks.
---
I just bought a PC and am going to play BFA as I wait because I havent played wow for 3-4 years
---
I wonder if parry effect stacks, like if 2 or more parries during reset swing timer of a boss makes their attack even faster
---
+22 FTW!
---
&gt;I mean, what's the point of Mythic raids if they are going to be nuked with nerfs by the time casual guilds catch up??
---
Because if you don't nerf them, then the casual guilds will disband. Simple as.
---
If, f.e. ghuun was pre nerf or even jaina was pre nerf it would probably takes 600+ maybe 1000+ pulls for a casual guild. Possibly more.
---
They would disband long before they kill the boss.
---
Meanwhile, new content would be coming out and they'd feel like they jut spent a tier of progress to get cucked on an end boss.
---
&gt; And it's way more fulfilling to kil the boss once than killing it on LFR, Normal, Heroic &amp; then Mythic.
---
If you're a mythic raider you do HC a few times for gear (or more if tryharding gear splits etc) but realistically you spend a handful of pulls on progress then speed clear HC ever after.
---
Then you progress Mythic.
---
There is no 4 tier progress.
---
Why the fuck would you ever want that.. Moreso as a paladin.
---
This was my strategy on beta and previously, while boring it maintains mana and as long as you maintain your wand you will do fine.  
---
I'm planning to crowd source linen for tailoring then funnel 9 robes from tailoring into DE enchanting so I can then craft wands. Setup is looking to only be 60-80 linen to get that setup.  
---
With the 40 setup, I'm on the fence about 5/5 weaving and instead getting additional range.
---
LOL yup! I remember you, as well. I believe we may have had a brief cross-over between our time in NA. Nav has played classic pretty hard, and posts here often. Mothugs and I along with a few others are planning on coming back. We all played on the unofficial servers on and off.
---
This article is exactly what I was looking for.  I remember some of the information from BlizzCon, but I clearly forgot they mentioned having the functional 1.12 client.  Thanks so much!
---
fucking hate looms. More than late expansion leveling nerfs, heirlooms fucking destroyed the leveling game. 
---
What a cancer.
---
to be fair, it isn't wrong. A lot of companies dont have original releases from 20 years ago. My place of employment only has databases back to version 4.4. sure, that is about 10 years but its a 20 year old piece of software. It used to not be standard procedure due to space limitations, prohibitive costs and bad policies to not keep things indefinitely. With that said, they also stated that 1.12 is the earliest they had available which is the entire reason we are starting at 1.12 and not 1.0
---
What a clever way to get me to open my battle.net launcher again just to check, but it's totally not going to work! I swear! ^(-checks- 
---
...damn it.)
---
Congrats? As the majority who played through Legion, and WOD, we know a shit expansion when we see it. Legion really good, WOD bad, and BFA is really bad.
---
I don’t really agree with a lot of this, but I like the reasoning and effort. Take an upvote.
---
I wore that when I was like 5 years old, I can try to look for it but I give no guarantee that I'l find it
---
Yeah I really dont think thats true, just check Kungen’s YouTube video where he is going through his Naxx screenshots, there are no warriors on the dps meters, only Mages and Rogues..
---
So no, warriors weren’t best dps post AQ40, and probably weren’t preAQ.
---
Well at the cost of taking ridiculously high dmg all the time. I doubt it will make a great difference on any contend that isn't "on farm".
---
just a joke my friend :)
---
You won't go wrong with any of those toons, they are all PvP monsters and , while warrior can be slow and tedious for the early levels, lock and Hunter are the two best solo leveling/questing classes (only outclassed by efficient aoe mages afaik)
---
Warriors are the best class at 60 imo they are the best tanks, top 2 or 3 dps classes (some people say they are the best) and they are unreal in grouped PvP . 
---
There isn't a clear cut choice with the classes you've given, unfortunately this one will be a personal preference type decision for you.
---
I'm in the same boat, considering mage and then the 3 healing classes. I know pally will be a pain in the ass to level but I know I'll love it at 60 and the free mounts . Mages are extremely Fun except for raiding , and there will be a ton of loot competition (also applies to locks) , priest seems really fun and OP as a dwarf with fear ward , and druid is always great for it's utility and it's ability to do anything you need. I'm torn and I'm sure my decision will change 1004893 times before launch haha.
---
Good luck with ur decision.
---
Usually 2h weapons.
---
But if you get a good 1hander, you can go 1h+shield or dual wield, it's not nearly as bad as people usually say.
---
Also attack speed hardly matters until level 36-40. You have no instant attacks besides overpower, and that one procs more with a faster weapon. It kinda helps if you're arms because you have a weapon-based bleed every time you crit, but crit chance is low early on anyway.
---
Sure. Tinfoil hats activate!!!
---
&gt; Miss dodge parry all the way to Sentinel Hill. Will it be THAT bad on live servers?
---
Based on [this post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-hit-tables/185675/12), PServers got it wrong. It'll be worse.
---
Shadowpriests are the kings of 1v1 minus warlock, which has nothing on other classes but a gajilion shadow resist.
---
I think regardless of how old this t shirt is. It was way ahead of it's time, the creator knew what he was doing lol.
---
Where did I say I want layering?
---
Don't those things only hit for 3 yards??
---
In theory, yes. Practically it's really hard because you need to get hit from a mob that isn't grey, you are not allowed to mount up and a lot of cc's remove the reckoning charges. 
---
So probably rather rare.
---
yeah we wouldnt kick them but there would be a constant reminder to dps not be in front as it was killing the tank, especially if you are pushing for a boss you really werent ready for. dont think the dps understood it and just thought tanks were being dicks
---
I'll invite you to read comments from someone actually testing on the beta and not watching streamers.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buj13g/comment/epd6obv
---
Many things are overtuned on privates yes, but likely just as many
---
Devilsaur Gauntlets and Leggings are your pre-BIS. But they're not Bind-on-Pickup, any LW can make them for you.
---
Did the same when i watched the video. Had a battle.net update and was like oh maybe this is it. But no ofc it wasnt lol
---
If everyone agreed with my character creation scheme...itd be a pretty boring looking world. Luckily this is one of those things that really doesnt matter. And anyone who says racials are so important you cant base your decision on aesthetics is a moron.
---
Out of curiosity, which bit do you disagree with the most?
---
Yes! This means Feral tanks will be much more viable than they are on Pservers!
---
#BearTankForever
---
Hold Blizzard accountable if it's a mess when the game launches, but acting as if bugs is the end of the world in a *beta* is ridiculous.
---
Yes. I always said that it would die after about 6 months. The reason? I played it, and not what most people here mean when they say "played" it, as in, didnt do MC.
---
I did everything up to 4hm when it was current. I got rank 9 before I decided to get 1337 DHK. I had 3 epic mounts (when you had to buy both the riding skill and the mount for 800g each). I had almost 365 days played in early TBC. 
---
But today I am actually looking forward to it and believe it will thrive. I still believe a large portion of people will quit fairly early tho.
---
/thread
---
Vanilla wow will be the death of wow honestly.  Give it 6  months, nothing will satisfy player base. Next they will scale all dungeons/raids to max level 130 for newest expansion, followed by death. Majority of the player base now are new, who want that classic feel, once they taste it they will be the first to bash on it. No summoning stones, queueing for dungeons / raids. No Arenas and PVP is imbalanced. Have fun complaining or farming gold.
---
Retail products are usually crappy overpriced garbage thats get repackaged and resold for profit. 
---
That is modern wow.
---
Search for "parry-haste" on google :)
---
I might start off with skinning leatherworking for the goldmaking and make my own devilsaur kit then swap to engineering later then
---
yep- my entire MC experience as a paladin
---
Been playing some PS , leveling a few toons considering mage and the 3 healing classes. I know pally will be a pain in the ass to level but I know I won't be overwhelmed at 60 as palas mainly heal tanks --  plus the free mounts .
---
 Mages are extremely Fun except for raiding , and there will be a ton of loot competition (also applies to locks) , 
---
priest seems really fun and OP as a dwarf with fear ward 
---
druid is always great for it's utility and it's ability to do anything you need. 
---
I'm only sure about one thing and it's  that my decision will change 1004893 times before release 
---
Any input? Im not a min-max raider or r1 pvper but I care about doing well and having fun , wow is a big time commitment so I don't want to regret my decision !
---
&gt; too tedious and easy
---
U wot m8?
---
P4? here i am still stuck with a 486 DX4/100
---
Yeah it REALLY is awesome for immersion. /s
---
Well...my deepest respect to the people that finished lvling their warriors back in the days.
---
Yeah it does, and it’s super shit.
---
As user hellraiserl33t once said:
---
&gt; bad bot
---
Yea, and my point is that the vast majority of guilds aren't going to outright kick people for 'standing in the fire' or attacking from the front.  
---
If they are told to stop and they don't, then that is another story, but typically people listened when you directly asked them not to do something.
---
I pretty much always play female toons. Back in classic wow I found that I got treated better when I played female toons when grouping up because morons would think that a female avatar was a female player.  Now it’s not even a thing, but back then it was and I never have really deviated. 
---
The exception is for Tauren, where I don’t care for the female model or animations much.   I also played a Dark Iron Dwarf male in BFA because they IMHO are the coolest looking characters in game.
---
Can some nerd make a guesstimate on how much this impacts Fury and rogue dups.
---
Cool hive mind you got there
---
Basically any class that isn't a warrior does ok alone
---
Hunters, rogues, locks, mages all come to mind
---
Second tier but not bad would be druid and priest 
---
Lastly would be pala, shamans and warr 
---
This is just my opinion though
---
They always nerf the fun stuff. Nerfed hog hooks too. Boo.
---
Never level with a crafting profession, they're not money makers (at least not in comparison to gathering professions).
---
I haven't yet looked into what spellbatching actually is, now I won't have to because you explained it pretty well. Tnx!
---
Well clearly no "mechanic" resulting from the outdated batching system was "intended". Like blizzard did not intend for 2 mages sheeping each other or shit, it was just a byproduct of the shitty ping.
---
So you can argue for or against spell batching thru an artificially gimped ping, arguing against certain mechanics that erose from it is kinda stupid.
---
It happened when Swifty left Darkspear
---
Mostly the never play gnomes and female undead.  A female gnome Warlock was my OG Vanilla too. And what I plan to bring back in classic. On the Horde side I plan on running an undead female priest.
---
I think he's more worried about increased damage while dw fury tanking even being viable at all
---
Luckily for us many streamers seem to want to be on the same realm, so hopefully they'll all congregate on one and that one will be the streamer-contaminated realm, and all the others will be free.
---
Dudes gonna be mad getting legit clepped by hpala
---
&gt;You can get into the stress test without paying anything,
---
you literally cannot. you need an active wow sub.
---
Bro, that’s actually insane. Thank you for the information, I believe it now for sure.
---
I am 37 so not really. It even fits better now lol...
---
Ill have a bit to think about might get mining and skinning first, thanks for the fast input :)
---
The green bonus effect is so accurate
---
I don't think Classic is any less endless than Retail, your options just aren't laid out for you.
---
This is the problem with Blizzard. Now days they develop games on how to make more money. The entire design and approach is based on how to get more subscribers for a longer period of time...but you know, if they would focus on actually making a good game and stop trying to make everyone happy, players would adapt to the game instead of the game adapting to the players.
---
The only game I liked as much as wow in it's prime was SWTOR. Leveling was fun, the story was good, and the raids had really interesting mechanics. I left it for to time constraints, not because I got bored.
---
Wait till August and I'm sure we'll find things to complain about. Not about the game itself but about blizz implementation.
---
They definitely weren't pre naxx; if nothing else rogues should be able to top them more often than not. 
---
But I still stand by the post naxx statement.  All I remember seeing near the end of vanilla on the forums were endless calls for nerfs, and seeing videos of warriors completely wrecking bosses that didn't require too much movement.  
---
Yea, there are fights in naxx that favor ranged and mages/locks can win those fights with that advantage, but if the advantage wasn't directly handed to one type or the other, then warriors will win.  Example being patchwerk, where warriors without a doubt could easily top the fight by a landslide.
---
https://youtu.be/QJi2bQzqR4A
---
Will flip for beta key
---
You do realize this does nothing to further the conversation. Try to cite information next time instead of just restating what Kane has already said. Thanks!
---
its because the retail version of wow shows in the world of Warcraft folder as “retail”.
---
Blizzard themselves came up with the term talk to them
---
yeah i dunno. I used to not hate fem UD, my first mage was one for years. 
---
Ever watch H3H3? Hila reminds me of a Fem UD. And I cant stand Hila. 
---
But gnomes!? how tf can you play that! lol
---
Conspiracy theory: JAB knew we did, but had to show how much interest there was before supporting it internally.  So he said that in order to rile us up into petitioning and all that jazz.
---
Activision would never allow it. them shareholders yo
---
40 yard throw range, 3 yard radius, damage and stun is calculated at the end of the cast -- regardless if they move away from the aoe zone during the throw animation.
---
"Wtf man my viewers are going to fuck me over during release" - don't stream then
---
"But I want to experience starting zones on launch with my viewers" - ???  
---
They have a literal army of autism to trade them gold for 5 seconds of attention but can't handle the negative consequences of cultivating an army of autism
---
You'll run into geared players regardless. Also premade groups are probably far worse to run into than streamers. They'll be better players 95% of the time.
---
While i do agree with you, i also really miss getting all the keys. I made sure to get the key/mallet/scepter/thing to help me get invited to dungeon. I played a priest though so it was probably unessecary but spaning all the Bosses made me feel so good about myself for a little while.
---
Hey Lucius! I remember you well :)
---
Yeah, I mentioned in one of the comments above the story about crafting Sulfuras for Avolc the female Tauren Warrior as I was the only one who could craft it at that point.
---
Hope you're doing well!
---
mining and skinning is your best choice.  you can then easily get any useful gear, by providing the mats yourself many crafters will do it for free if they get a skill point out of it.  And you can always give them a tip if you want.
---
And the raw mats will provide some income too (don't get high hopes, everybody will gather, so the market will be flooded and the prices will be low, but it still beats getting nothing)
---
It's more like when you put onld clothes in the attic and forget about them. Then some kid asks where the cool shirt from a decade ago is. You say that shirt sucks and you were stupid to like it. You tell people you couldn't find it anyway even though you just don't want to go into the attic. Then a million people say they will pay you money if you wear it again so actually go into the attic and low and behold it's where you put it.
---
Idiots maybe, not people.
---
90g was insane amounts for me at that time. Respects were ultra expensive and I had just bought a mount :p
---
My TBC guild was consistently world top 30, sometimes top 10. Our schedule was "only" 4-5 hours, 6 days per week. 7 days at 8-10 hours and you wouldn't have consumables farmed.
---
My account was made during WOTLK and I wasn't subbed to WoW but I still got stress test invite, so I don't know
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ExpensiveTentativeTitanBlargNaut
---
It was bigger and harder than WOTLK Naxx.
---
Perfect summary.  
---
I will add that if you manage to get a Warlock into Naxx, you become a god with that gear and they go from being low tier DPS to top. 
---
I also think of the 3 (since hunter is out for UD), you will have the most enjoyable leveling experience with a Warlock, with essentially no downtime between pulling multiple mobs.
---
Easy, fourth grade math.
---
&gt; Three septillion five hundred sixty sextillion seventy-four quintillion five hundred twenty-three quadrillion nine hundred trillion eleven billion two hundred forty-four million eight hundred sixty-three thousand nine hundred sixty-one
---
sweet, Beta! mine came in a few days later after it started.  
---
but yeah I believe my break is around start of Fireland, had to go to europe for a week and decide to try a year free of WoW, go figure!
---
Lolol
---
Esfand's reaction LOL
---
It will meaningfully increase subs, because of the people subbing just for a chance to get into classic. At least that’s what I believe op thinks. I for one didn’t resub, but that doesn’t mean hundreds if not thousands of people resubbed just for the chance.
---
I'm really hoping that Blizzard doesn't rush it. If I was the devs I would set a percentage to 60 goal (e.g. 20-30% of the active player base at 60 by phase 2/3 etc.) rather than listening to community feedback which is usually just the forums.
---
Nope. No lazyscript.
---
I just recently rolled a hunter and warlock on retail (so possibly  take w/ a grain of salt, but...). The hunter was way, way more fun.
---
Yeah smart, the market will be crazy during the start
---
Yet if we are talking immersive gameplay and social aspects, then transmog makes little sense when trying to maintain those things.  
---
The social encounters we have with people can change based on how we perceive that person, and if we can tell they lack experience based on what they have (or are more likely to lack experience), then we may shift to a more helpful tone or understanding one. 
---
If gear is the crux of the game's reward system (which it is in this case), then it is more immersive to be able to see these rewards on other people, and for them to see what you have accomplished as well.  It makes the world feel alive rather than contrived.  I would consider people mixing and matching random crap to be a contrived way to have people perceive you in a way that is unrelated to the gameplay of the game we are all experiencing together.
---
If your goal is to level quickly, this is what I would do:
---
1. Get skinning and mining. Skin everything, mine what's in front of you (small deviations okay).
---
2. Drop mining for enchanting when you can no longer mine the zone you're in.
---
3. Don't level enchanting. Just DE quest rewards you won't use (usually better to vendor weapons though).
---
4. When you get to 60, drop enchanting for mining again.
---
5. Once you have all the materials needed to level engineering, drop skinning for it.
---
Yeah hunter is cool as well I have a hard time picking my class, I'm on the fence with hunter, rogue and mage right now and I have no idea which to pick.
---
It isn't an artificial hardware limitation it is the same (or as close as can be on current engine) configuration of the server from when there was hardware limitations, leading to combat which will feel the same.
---
I don't think it's about risk. It's more about the types of games D2 and classic are. They take time, hell even diablo 2 lod takes a lot of patience to find decent gear. You need to know which monsters to farm to get certain items etc.
---
That era in gaming is gone, really. Just listen to the current head of blizzard who's famous for the "You think you do, but you don't", when he plays classic wow.
---
He talks about having to rest in between fighting, and how it "Get's in the way of the action." To people like this guy, the idea of having mechanics that immerse you, are not good mechanics. It's completely lost on him that these games aren't really action games at their core.
---
I think scaling is the best way to go when it comes to retail, because without it you outlevel all the zones before you finish their storyline. In retail scaling is really the only realistic way to allow people to play zones all the way through, imo.
---
My gap was in vanilla, my first raiding guild fell apart and GTA San Andreas existed....
---
I was going to enable that hot coffee mod goddamnit.
---
Dont you need certain enchanting level to disenchant in vanilla?
---
Anyone else notice that the mobs (particularly the critters) in Elwynn Forest have random Skinnable status? It's like 50/50 on whether a critter is skinnable. I noticed that basically no mobs (critters excluded) in Northshire abbey are skinnable. Not sure if that's normal - I submitted a bug for it
---
Good catch.
---
I was kicked once from NAXX 25 going for server first, after raiding for something like 13 hours straight I got hit by the cleave on sapphiron on the first pull and removed from group... they got the achievement some 2-3 hours later :(
---
The biggest flaw to tbc might be leaving Azeroth, instead of using some of the zones that aren’t used
---
It made Azeroth a lvling zone rather than an active part of the world
---
They probably had to leave at some point, but I don’t think they had to in the first expansion
---
Omg I want one
---
Nah. Having to meet up and /inspect someone doesn't offer any magic social sauce.
---
I agree with you. It’s nice knowing that the gear your get isn’t trumped by an RNG mechanic. 
---
I also really like the ability to jump between PvP and PVE without having to swap around too much gear.  BFA sort of did away with that, but with the Azerite gear system, you’re still left collected items with different perks that are more appealing to PvP.
---
I wish I had a 125 ping back then. As an australian 350 was about the best I could ever hope for and it was usually 400-500.
---
Nope. Level 1 Enchanting can DE everything.
---
Wasn't it basically a reskinned wow? I didn't play it, but I heard that critique from a lot of people that wanted something new and interesting but just got wow with lightsabers. I played rift long enough to reach level cap and realize it was basically the same deal. 
---
I wanted a wow killer that was new and different, or innovative in some way, like how it felt going from EQ to WoW. I genuinely thought wildstar would be that, but I couldn't even reach level cap in that game without dying from boredom.
---
we said PIC !
---
I definitely think your estimates are off. My guess would be much longer patch cycles. Classic isn't their main priority and it wouldn't benefit them to release content too quickly. Their previous history shouldn't be relied on too heavily since there is a finite amount of content coming. Though I do think they won't release anything right around christmas.
---
Mom-mode on  
---
You should clean your room more often...  
---
Mom-mode off
---
I think just 1. And it grants skill ups at lower levels if I remember correctly.
---
Go horde then they might have the ugly continent but they stronk 
---
For the Horde!
---
Yeah I didnt have a long tenure with NA, i was in DI before, then when Epic broke up and DI started taking in Epics member like a refugee camp is when I joined NA, Liminal got me in. Yeah I havent played wow since Wrath, but im coming back for classic, going back to my roots, Tauren shaman!
---
Hah, their touted 1.12 client is actually a TBC client!  Blizzard confirmed idiots.
---
Its probably because they are max leveled
---
I feel it took a bit more than scrubs to do AQ40 and the intro to naxx40, but I suppose we all have our own definition of what a good player might be.  
---
I think memory has eluded many people on the subject of PvE arms builds personally.  It didn't beat out fury 2h, but it wasn't far off.
---
I've never been a big fan of 5/5 Shadow Weaving. I'd much rather go 1-3 points into it and use the other 2-4 elsewhere.
---
something he didn't mention: you have to queue at an npc inside of a major city. also, you can be queued for multiple BGs at once, and if you're inside a BG when another one pops, you can join the second BG without deserter.

I personally am gonna stick with 5/5 just because it's my job in the raid, but I can see other people not going 5/5!
---
If you want to be competitive at anything you need engineering

Stacking avoidance stats just makes the inevitable string of big bits on you more lethal.
---
A friendly reminder to let people play how they like. This includes telling others that they are bad if you so wish to.
---
Wait!? This was the cause?! Holy damn I didn't know this was a thing. The number of times I'd heal or pop a.big CD and tank instantly dying afterwords made me go crazy before. Glad after all these years I know what was the cause
---
I was able to form a group with a 20 warlock, two 24 warriors, and two 22 Paladin's in about 15 minutes. We (almost) completed it in under an hour including travel time (we didnt finish last boss due to server restart)
---
Is it only me or Blizzard's math does not add up?  
---
" We tested attacking creatures at -5, +0, +1, +2, +3, +5, and +15 levels relative to our level (so for the level 15 test, we attacked level 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 35 mobs). "  
---
15 + 15 =/= 35 it is 30 :D
---
CoD4 was the Halo killer.
---
Thank you random stranger for speaking out for me, and to Just_WoW_Things, no i did not play any expansions except vanilla wow, but I bet you played MOP :)
---
Don't engage this pserver idiot.
---
You get better prices from the library vendor. He sells Pattern: Mooncloth Robe and various waters. That's it. There was some speculation (based on quest text and dialogue) they'd be involved with Blackwing Lair and Ashbringer, but Blizzard never did anything with it.
---
Classic had addons that tracked gear score etc, I don’t think it’s a huge issue here. Also itemisation is a little different in classic as sometimes blues are better than purples.
---
OT: Try to condense your thoughts into less than 100 words...
---
Your statement doesnt´t contradict mine.
---
&gt;configuration of the server from when there was hardware limitations
---
So making it like it was in the past with worse serverhardware than todays, is an artificial limitation.
---
You can download any PS vanilla server and see for yourself, if you like a class/race combo.
---
Is it from somewhere in Tanaris?
---
There certainly were a lot of similarities, but it always really felt like it's own game to me. Each class had it's own unique story, so leveling an alt was much more enjoyable than in WoW.
---
It'll be there. But I don't know why you'd waste the hours to get it.
---
Massive boost for alliance cuz of salv buff
---
No changes.
---
How cute! You have your very own goblin!!
---
Yeah, everything after phase 3 is really shaky—a sort of "fastest case scenario". I'm pretty confidant about a January release for phase 3 though. Anything longer and people will be extremely salty about WPvP honor farming at flight masters (especially since PvP gear will be unambiguously BIS during this period).
---
Ok, but it kind of depends on the timing of this crap happening.  If growl is used as a warrior tries to sunder a target, but that sunder doesn't land (parried, dodged, miss, whatever) then of course that warrior is now screwed and without a source of rage generation.  
---
Rage gen simply sucks in vanilla; not sure how you don't take that into account tbh.
---
Yeah it is his, compare it to others and you'll see the icons are in different places
---
You had like 5 druids in this raid?
---
Vanilla was the most elitist time of this game's existence.  When rewards mean the most, then humility is thrown out the window for many.
---
Stvietnam is endless
---
Its because of the level 30 level cap and the PvP meta. Feral is absolutely the superior way to level as Druid. 
---
Natures Swiftness is just a very powerful tool thats better than anything in the other trees. Might as well take it since leveling efficiency is pointless if your capped at 30
---
You are right, I misinterpreted your comment.
---
* some animals when killed show the loot icon/effect but when looted show empty box and after that the icon/effect also dissapears (false positive for loot or loot bugs out)
---
* wand shoot will \~insta cancel when pressed during spell like a frostbolt is flying to the target. It will stay on when enabled during spell cast time or after spell hit the target
---
While I haven’t played with ESO or current retail wow, I agree with your statement. 
---
I remember when I accidentally stumble on Western Plagueland and got killed by one of those undead bear. It has a lasting impression on me and I knew that this area was serious. Even after I reached the appropriate level to quest in the area, I was still very intimidated by the area and I was on high alert all of the time.
---
I think having high level areas help with the immersion of the world. It helps you feel more seasoned that you are no longer a new adventurer and that your past adventures have led you to this point.
---
^ [This is not true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjWSRTYV8e0)
---
To actually answer your question it's called retail because it's the version available at retailers. 
---
It's the retail version of the game. The version you can go and buy.
---
Join me I left my room in Searing Gorge!
---
That is correct, and it must be completed  in order to open the trogg kill quest and the delivery quests
---
ive played every patch of retail and ever since phasing has come out i have never seen someone get invited and that whole group gets sharded while fighting a mob, they might get sharded after but they dont just all move like that, the only time something like that happens is when you join someone elses shard.
---
Meta
---
Didn't blizzard say they would be looking at adjusting this over the course of the beta?  They are already fully aware that it needs some tweaking, because the original system was entirely based off of the average net speed being DSL levels.
---
most of them wont last long. I highly doubt most people will even get past 40. A lot of grinding involved and tons of waiting for quest mob to spawn.
---
nonsense. wearing old gear is great fun, its a game, it is supposed to be fun.
---
And how many hundreds of times can you run ICC and still be immersed in the story.
---
*Reduced chance of getting laid by 99%*
---
So you're saying theres a chance!?
---
Where is this?
---
You mean that locks are bad?
---
Isn't soulstoning yourself and dying the vanilla version of soulshatter? Don't have to rely on anyone else to take feign death to the extreme.
---
It may have been in DI that I knew you. I had a stint there, as well. Dunno -- either way, I'll see ya in game!
---
As usual, you have different people saying different things.  Idk why people keep treating it as one side as an entire entity.  
---
A large group of people want no changes. 
---
A different group of of people want mostly no changes. 
---
Another group wants some changes. 
---
The list goes on and on.. but to assume these are all the same people flip flopping is just asinine and doesn't help anything.
---
Feral respec to restro at max
---
That wasn’t his argument at all? It was “wow it’s cool to recognize someone’s progression by looking at them”. I’m personally not a fan of transmog especially in something like a pvp server. Looking at someone and going “oh shit I should run the other way” because they have better gear is a pretty cool aspect. While I see the appeal of being a fashion show farmer, it takes a bit out of the game.
---
In vanilla you have to go to almost every zone to level up, unless you grind a lot. There arent enough quests in one continent to get to level 60, not even close.
---
Language is an evolving thing. Words change meanings. It happens.
---
In this case its just some people incorrectly used a word and it caught on as way to describe the divide between present day WoW and older versions of the game,  but usually just vanilla WoW.
---
I've never seen anyone confused at the term "retail wow". Everyone immediately understands what that means, so I think its fine. Don't sweat the small stuff man.
---
She got me this new game!
---
Starter zones only go to 15(?), then most zones scale to a fixed point (vanilla zones only go to 60 for example). Though there is the occasional rare mob that is bugged and scales all the way to 120 - discovered a few while redoing loremaster. 
---
It’s a really good addition to retail in my opinion, but which obviously has no place in classic. 
---
Also the scaling while levelling 110-120 was admittedly very poorly done but people are greatly overstating the state of bfa max level scaling, it’s fine honestly.
---
I know it's not the best, but there are few things as fun as seeing someones health bar evaporate after a huge windfury crit.  Shammy for life
---
Couldn’t support this sentiment more.
---
yea and class design peaks in wotlk
---
vanilla trees are very raw and unfinished
---
layering is not suppose to solve those issues, its meant to solve crowded zones
---
I know i do!
---
The Order of the Slaming Ruby?
---
What is Slaming?
---
Show me your vanilla guild logos! Before Discord people used guild websites to attract people and my buddy spent a lot of time making our logo.
---
thank you for articulating what has been on my mind for some time. this is why i dropped out of raiding.
---
No one wants layering, we want Classic. If Blizzard wont invest in more servers for longevity, or post-hype populations, or because they are cheap bastards, then layering is what gets us Classic. The backend of running servers is incredibly expensive, it isn’t an issue of “just make more servers.”
---
Play a different class this time?
---
if the enemy is in the aoe zone at the end of the cast you hit it basically
---
If you were a kid during wotlk, then don't even bother with vanilla. 
---
&gt;A few months later I started playing on a pserver and found the experience I was looking for, but this time I simply couldn't get into it because it wasn't retail and it didn't feel like the genuine WoW experience that everyone was raving about.
---
Proves my point. You'll quit before lvl 40.
---
It's an F.. :p
---
It also means you're all gonna be begging for tranquil air totem instead of WF
---
Blizzard isn't #NoChanges. They've made a lot of small reasonable changes. Colorblind modes, Layering, Cross-Realm BGs, secretly making Gnomes bigger but saying they've always been that size, etc.
---
They got rid of a lot of wall jumping you could do before. I know Alliance have a slightly longer trek to SM now cause of that.
---
There are a lot of feral talents in the restoration tree. Being level 30 creates a different situation than just leveling.
---
Damn, how did you make this?
---
If you say so...
---
Leveling a warrior gets easier, but it’s very slow going to start. 
---
Your reward is the ability to tank end game content as the only real tanking class, and also some of the best DPS end game. 
---
Priest sounds like a better fit considering the leveling process will be more enjoyable and you’re arguably the 2nd most vital class end game after warriors.
---
with how leveling was done in a lot of TBC and all of WotLK and onward level scaling is fine as you could never get a quest that is too high level or make your own level of hard again so why not let people play the stuff they like insted.
---
for no scaled leveling you also need to be able to get quests that are too hard to do right away. (whirlwind axe for warriors)
---
personally i think a neat idea would be that each zone has its own internal level/progress bar while still having scaled leveling so you enter a new zone and shit is dangerous even tho you could have gone here at 20 you are now 40 you get quests that have gasp red level mobs and as you kill stuff in the zone, do quests etc. the quests becomes easier.
---
a sort of best of both worlds. but i would also like blizzard on retail to go F it and just push everything not BfA content into one giant pool of level 1-60 content you can do with BfA being 60-70.
---
Assuming its spawned in at launch you'd be "wasting" about 20 minutes.
---
Thanks for all the work you and other dev made during the past years. Without you, we would not be able to play classic today. I think it is not said enough
---
Interesting. Why would they be more viable?
---
he says 4:3 is better
---
I think its really true
---
ever since I switched from a natural 4:3 monitor to a wide one I've been shit in FPS games. I used to be really good before. Feelsbadman.
---
For fun and PvP you can't go wrong with a Rogue
---
I'll partly agree that it can be misunderstood as an Some :p
---
So much for "OMG everything on pirate servers is accurate, our most obsessive neckbeards have based EVERYTHING on the best video evidence, how dare you suggest otherwise!". An absolutely critical part of the game mechanics which affects every part of raiding was off by a massive 10%.
---
I suspect it won't be the first such major difference we discover as the Classic testing goes on.
---
Call me crazy, call me nostalgic, but I think it's going to come out in the wash that the optimal approach to endgame in 2019 is not going to be all that different to the optimal approach in 2006.
---
They made a TON of good changes going into BC.  Every single spec got more fleshed out while maintaining uniqueness and class identity.
---
There were also bad things about BC, mainly flying and resilience, but overall the changes were positive.
---
Can you link me the 2006-era theorycraft then? I'm very interested.
---
I got 12 back in vanilla. I only remember because of how much I'd attempt it and was amazed going from 8 to 12 in one fell swoop.
---
Perfect thanks
---
Sweet
---
Friend of mine whom I co-founded  The Flaming Ruby with was decent at Photoshop, at least for 2005.
---
Ohh, one of my my memorable moments playing a hunter is getting killed trying to tame pets! Loved it.
---
I think from memory engineering also for hunters can craft ammo and scopes right?
---
What about things like Getting on and under storm wind?
---
How did you queue up for WSG as a lvl 10? I though it was 11+ in Vanilla?
---
This will be a sneaking mission. You must not be seen by the enemy. You must leave no trace of your presence. Is that clear? This kind of infiltration is the SI:7 unit's specialty. In other words, weapons and equipment are procure on-site... that goes for food as well. You're completely naked, just as your name implies.
---
Hahaha god damn you man, at least I got you once, you had to log when higher levels came;)
---
Thanks for your 2cents. Is there a level where you would say that’s the breaking point for warrior?
---
That's bullshit. BfA doesn't need Classic's help to kill itself.
---
Do what you want but, having leveled one fairly recently, priests do not struggle levelling at all.
---
No arms will never be good in PvE sadly...
---
So a lot of things are wrong with that.
---
A lot streamers aren't releasing their realm of choice precisely because they don't want to be surrounded by hordes of followers making it impossible to grind or quest. 
---
None of the streamers are going to be server firsts. Its going to be someone account sharing or just someone like Joana (probably not Joana though) who has spent a lot of time just leveling for fun to get their time down.
---
The only thing you said that was probably right was the mount thing. I imagine any streamer that is willing to take gold will probably have a very easy level 40 mount.
---
Yes he did, I was watching the stream live in Legion and he was like "who wants this man" he's a moron who rides the wave with his fake hype.
---
I remember hitting 40 on my warlock and just riding around for hours marveling at how fast I was going. 
---
I loved that feeling completing my blue dreadmist set, and thinking how powerful I was. 
---
When I got my first epic item, which was the tier 2 helmet in ony, I would just stand in iron forge for friends and onlookers to stare in amazement at a Purple item. 
---
I was/am a huge dork.
---
Cross realm bgs confirmed
---
For context, this was after they already corpse-camped Esfand for 20 minutes. It was really not fun to watch.
---
Fair enough. I admittedly did not read the rules.
---
before the highest end gears, pretty bad in 1v1 yes
---
Yes because of that 10 normal, 10 hc, 25 normal, 25 hc system. I quit after killing lich king 25 hc. Cataclysm had the same raiding system. Now its even worse (lfr, normal, hc, mythic)
---
Stormwind I think.
---
Tedious doesn’t mean hard
---
As a shadow priest your main job is to keep up shadow weaving. Which is why it's better to use rank 1 mindflay over a weapon when low on mana. But even if you have to use a weapon, wand DPS is much higher than melee weapon DPS. Even a pre-raid wand like Bonecreeper Stylus has more than 10 DPS over Ebon Hand. Epic wands typically have 22-35 more DPS. I'm not much of a theory crafter, but I doubt that the weapon is gonna proc often enough to make it worth moving into melee range.
---
Hi, /u/Kortap, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Jokes on you, Esfand actually threw the best grenade in the Beta so far:  [https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv/clip/FunMoldyAlmondImGlitch](https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv/clip/FunMoldyAlmondImGlitch)
---
Did you spec into imp. Shout
---
Rogues aren't the fastest, most place them about 7th overall. But its not like Druids and Hunters are twice as fast or even the slowest leveling classes. Assuming both are equally efficient I'd say it'd probably take an extra day or two for the Rogue or Warrior
---
I don‘t even know for how long i could have entered the Beta already, never recieved a mail. Tried in bnet 2 days ago and got in.
---
no im level 5
---
Which is basically copied from Diablo 3.
---
I've got a for the horde + crest zip up hoodie that my rents bought for me in 2006, shits legit tiny because i was 13/14 and it's got no chance of fitting since i've gotten like a foot taller and hit the gym since then but i do still have it.
---
Might have to wear it for our launch LAN even if just to justify keeping it for like 12-15 years.
---
The only time wow was actually wow.
---
But this is not representative of the layering concept as it is intended?
---
You level as feral, the cat form movement speed talent is probably the single most impactful talent for leveling. 
---
At max level you respect but natureswiftness is a S tier talent for both healing and pvp for a lot of builds go for it. 
---
0/30/21 is also a interesting druid build as it can be both a passable healer and a passable tank (in the right gear) so a lot of people use it as a fresh 60. It lets you tank 5mans or heal them (whatever gets you in the group faster) so you can build up both a healing set and a feral set.  
---
You could even argue that it has some viability in raids as the extra mana helps for decurse duty as well as being tank number 4 or 5 or something when needed.  
---
in the beta they are basically "max" level and have switched to a pvp spec. NS is basically amazing for pvp so its not that strange they would go for it.
---
can't you just make characters with your name on various servers?  than you have backup, and you lose is the let's say 15 levels gained
---
Now we know, alliance master faction :(
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game
---
Lol what? This is literally not true. Layering is a new technology they only started testing in the first stress test. They described how it's meant to work, and it is explicitly not supposed to phase you unless join a group on another layer. Not to mention there are already blue posts explicitly calling it a bug.
---
But hey, being incessantly cynical and angry is what this sub is all about. Keep downvoting anyone optimistic and calling everything shitty.
---
Troll warr masterrace
---
we facebook now?
---
There's some room to argue that Duel Wield Arms til you get your Whirlwind Axe is actually really good due to Overpower crits.
---
I know it sounds insane to DW Arms, but the more times you swing, the more chance the enemies is gonna Dodge, which means you get a fat juicy Overpower off several times. Probably not 'the' best spec, but definitely an option until whirlwind axe.
---
The guy above you clearly never played hunter in vanilla, it does have one of the biggest skill ceilings in the game and  you cant just manage it with simple "macros and addons".
---
If you let a good player into your deadzone on a 1v1 or even 1vX situation, you lost.
---
I would say it gets easier at 36ish when you get whirlwind and a few levels after that execute ranks up again. 
---
TBH though, leveling a warrior is made 1000% more enjoyable with a quest buddy. 
---
Back when I ran a warrior in Vanilla all the way through wrath (before cataclysm made them a lot easier to solo level) I would either ask a friend or just ask in general if anyone wanted a warrior buddy to quest with and almost always got a response.  
---
Classic wow is a lot more social so you should be able to group up with ease.
---
I disagree. 
---
Having you turn on individual bosses detracts from the sense of progressing on a difficulty. In modern WoW, I will agree that LFR is a detriment to the game and should be removed. I can't speak for mythic because I've never touched it myself (neither has &gt;80% of the playerbase), but normal and heroic are excellently done and compliment each other perfectly.
---
In Ulduar, some bosses could be opted to have additional mechanics and would, as you said, "put [players] at a disadvantage for better loot and glory!" This, also as you said, is functionally no different than heroic save for one key difference. You have to progress it with the entire raid in the "hardmode". You shouldn't be able to opt in to a boss' hardmode halfway through a raid if you didn't first complete all fights leading up to it in the hard mode.
---
Moreover, your knowledge and understanding of different difficulties is derived from inexperience. There are only 4 difficulties of raid with LFR dropping a level less than a world boss. Your claim that people didn't run Emerald Nightmare after newer raids is simply incorrect. In fact, I distinctly remember running it even after I had my tier set from Nighthold because friends/guildies needed it for either gearing alts or the Balance of Power questline. If you can explain how that's different to a Naxx geared character running MC, I'd be excited to hear it. Also, there is a very clear difference to clearing normal Xavius vs Heroic Xavius, as it also implies killing every other boss in EN on heroic (a difficulty with more and harder mechanics).
---
On a side note, you also clearly have never tried Mekkatorque above normal because he's got a heroic mechanic that is exclusive to that difficulty and requires much more coordination from your group than normal. Trying to argue that modern raids require less coordination and player input than vanilla raids is quite laughable, as the hardest thing about vanilla raids is just getting 40 people online and on the same page.
---
Lastly, if you have raided any time since Highmaul, I can't understand how you could be *for* a static group size. That's truly mind-boggling how anyone could consider flexible raid size a bad thing.
---
I know classicwow doesnt believe it but druids were extremely viable healers. Though if you think that's silly just know our guild had 7 druids on our first kill of the first spider boss in naxx for the remove poisons lol
---
Also battle res.
---
Also.. moonkin just standing there.. menacingly
---
Hunters got energy. The specs were ruined. Maybe it was different with other classes, but I saw how dumb down they were going and I bailed. Not sure if I should believe you, or presume you're wrong and that like hunters, they _didn't_ actually flesh out specs.
---
Did the ability text read different or is it your stats that go up more than they should?
---
I am too old to remember is there any dual wield bosses in classic, because if yes, they have increased parry rate. I remember that I had to wear high hit bonus gear to tank brutalus. Without high as possible hit rate he was destroying every tank.
---
That first time you reach a 1k crit. UNGHHHH
---
Rage abilities cost the same Rage at all levels so there is no reason to not use the best rank, automatically does it for you, you cant down rank. Not sure if this is what you are asking
---
You can just do HOTW 0/30/21 spec and do both.
---
And I want the answer in powdered form.
---
its 40%, but one thing to take in mind is that not all bosses have parry haste. from vanilla wow-fandom:
---
"Note: When a mob parries an attack, its swing timer also advances in the same manner. This does not apply to certain raid bosses for which parry-haste functionality has been explicitly turned off by the game designers."
---
Love these comments... So you are confirming that the aggro works the same on classic as in private servers ? THANKS random internet fact dude \o/
---
im gaining the extra power, and the ability text.. im wondering why this is why people were saying classic felt easier?
---
I never watch streamers, except occasionally a short youtube clip, if they edited it into something decent, so I don;t know much about them, but one thing I noticed , they like to be together.  Streamer A and his posse against streamer B and his mob.  This makes sense, because you can create more 'drama' with more characters.  
---
So I think this means at least some of them will join the same server(s),   and other servers will be streamer free.
---
“Stop complaining about people watching you and trying to interact with you”
---
Now that’s a hot take.
---
beat me to it. 
---
hate to be a cynic, but you can tell when people are cut out for MMOs
---
Yeah it’s really sad that he doesn’t realize how much downtime actually adds to the overall “action” in a game. In a way the lulls actually build suspense for eventual fights and make them feel way more impactful. 
---
I think patience is a really good word to describe the difference between new and old Blizzard games.
---
you know what make me sad about heirlooms? it just utterly killed KILLED getting that epic weapon/gear while leveling you know what i did on my 3 alts once i reached level 65 in TBC/early WotLK? i instantly went to do ring of blood inorder to get an insane weapon and there was always a ton of people looking for a group to do the quests it was amazing just social fun.
---
with heirlooms there was no veteran to show the new players this is an awsome weapon lets go grab it.
---
i think there were many better ways for blizzard to implement a quicker leveling system than removing the need for gear that is honestly 2 convince nice to haves put into one and offering as much as they did right away was also a huge mistake. (a lot the later half of WotLK was huge misstake on a systems level)
---
Pandaria was in the lore when warcraft 3 came out. Chen was in WC3.
---
The thing is though, a lot of changes Bliz has made since vanilla is because a majority of a player base were doing something to improve their experience. Every raider had a certain mod with x function, so why not implement it? The majority of x class took took y talent, so why not integrate it and retool the talents? 
---
Also, back in the day there were excel sheets you could download to help you do the math that mods do automatically now through the armory. They helped you optimize gear and rotation, if you put the values in correctly and didn't mess with the formulas. There were even excel sheets for raid leaders to track everyone's gear. I can't think of the sites, but there were math sites that were similar in purpose to github where people would share the formulas and calculations for optimization. Theorycrafting back then was wild (it could still be, I just haven't had that kind of time to devote in the past decade). And for the more casual player there was Thottbot to search loot tables and drop rates. It's not new by any means, it's just easier and more accessible now.
---
&gt; Well clearly no "mechanic" resulting from the outdated batching system was "intended". Like blizzard did not intend for 2 mages sheeping each other or shit, it was just a byproduct of the shitty ping.
---
I think that the difference here is that there was no clear developer intent that Mages shouldn't be able to sheep each other, nor any action specifically taken to prevent it.  Whereas there *was* a conscious decision to make it so that critical hits received while sitting would not proc "on received crit" effects, and batching is preventing that decision from being effective.
---
On top of all this, all you do is auto attack. And judge, if you have mana.
---
And press consecration for AoE, I guess...? If mana would allow.
---
Seriously, you're hamstringing yourself hard for some seriously asinine gameplay. There's practically nothing about a ret paladin to be passionate about except class flavor.
---
But how far will flavor and auto attacks take you?
---
Because every server will have dozens of incredibly popular streamers, right?
---
Well if you are gaining 1 extra power it could either be a bug or it could be a rounding issue when applying battleshout. Either way one extra attack power isn't going to break the game for you.
---
If I plan on playing for an 8 hour stretch of PvP, how much of that time will I spend farming shards?
---
We were all dorks back then brother
---
No one let this guy do math.

---
It's literally all the point of this post, why stick to old continent and cities of the green loot "over there" it's even better than the raid one?
---
This is what killed wow for me
---
TLDR: Own slaves.
---
There's been good and evil on both sides. Atrocities on both sides. Definitely just a matter of opinion.
---
Just macro to equip shield and work on your ninja reflexes to press it after a parry /s
---
Sorry, you said a non dead p server, I read it as the opposite, my apologies.
---
I agree with your initial premise now that I've read it correctly, 
---
&gt; Stuck waiting on a name mob with 5 minute respawn timer trying to play tag war with 10 other people
---
Which is why I think it shouldn't exist passed lvl 10, where there will be thousands of players competing. After that, things spread out and the competition is part of the experience, even with a higher than normal population server. More horde will have to level in the Eastern Kingdoms 10-30 rather than all sticking to Kalimdore.
---
And at end game, beta tested dynamic spawn rates are a better solution to balancing economy of resources against higher population levels than originally in wow.
---
In vanilla they are.
---
This. You can perfectly alter between the two weapons: When I level a priest most of the time I shoot 2x with my wand, right click, to AA with my staff (since they are on a separate "swing timer") then 2x wand #repeat

---
Once again, it makes sense because there are WAY bigger problems with the game.
---
You're right for sure. I'm looking forward to have the old feelings again. Everything felt more special - even the group plays.
---
My brother is gonna play a Hunter - guess thats not the best combo to level. The challenge to level a Warrior is so attractive to me, but im scared that I'm loosing the will to level out of frustration. But I guess, I'll stay strong!
---
sad stuff then
---
it would have been great news for anyone fighting over 1handeds
---
Honorable ?
---
appreciate the effort. a shame you didn't get beta access!
---
i always thought it was weird that the maximum camera zoom is not accessible from the options menu and requires a script.
---
but how did he get the data? do you remember anything about the thread? it does seem like less people play but with the game being more popular worldwide now and sharding, it seems tough to get an estimate.
---
But it's not. It's not about players parrying bosses' attacks, but bosses parrying players' attacks.
---
The old blades of light is pathetic compared to the new one. The new one consistently catches low level players out.
---
heirlooms existed to fix the growing need for alts on top end guilds. i was in a top 100 guild at the time and there was a lot of talk and push for people to get alts i know some made it a requirement that is why it was added. but honestly it is just too powerful it is everything in one part.
---
Oh mannnnnn I remember those dwarves fighting that dragon when you used the FP to fly North from Stormwind.
---
More like they are both good guys than a matter of opinion. Even in vanilla both sides have good and evil moments.
---
honestly ive lurked so much and seeing all the negativity has me so perplexed, because the game is really as cool or cooler than its ever been. so i feel motivated to speak out against this overwhelming resentment.
---
no i only have 1 rank of the ability but when i level up it automatically gets stronger, i didnt buy a new rank
---
It's cognitive dissonance. JAB through his personal views associated community needs with nostalgia, and not superior game design certain people looked for and which differences in comparision to retail started to vocally reveal lately. Would be amazing If Classic had whole Blizzard support, but that was unrealistic to happen — I guess let's be thankful Mike Morhaime for showing green light.
---
Hybrid classey don't only have dps problems. Raids drop so few items that outside of tiers they are last to get gear. Also balance druid is out just because of the debuff cap for example.
---
Come on man, why the hell you have to ruin it!?!?!?
---
+17 Duelling
---
I plan on making my main and alt on server A and my name again on server B. Main and alt have 4 letter names, rip.
---
&gt; Bears have a slight advantage at dealing with parry haste compared to Warriors (more EH = better chance to survive unexpected burst damage), but not enough to make a difference. Druids are still better off-tanks and Warriors are still better main tanks.
---
Not really tbh. Maybe in later expansions. But since bears can be so easily crushed/critted, an unexpected parry/haste can just oneshot them more easily.
---
That's why warriors (if they are not fury tanking) are kings in vanilla tanking
---
Yeah you're right, but if TPS is going to be lower because of more parries, then its still an indirect "buff" to druid since they have no issue with threat anyway
---
Its a cheap answer but I'm just using my original class character names. I always thought it was lame to mix names like LOTR characters into other things.
---
battle shout gives the same AP until level 10/12 where you get the next rank.
---
You definitely missremember
---
Makes questing a lot faster too, in the long run
---
Yeah and Gay means Happy, but nobody is out there saying "Hey I got into the classic beta, I'm so gay!"
---
That's just how language works man.
---
I might be wrong, but I think it's an indirect buff to Feral tanks by the two following points:
---
1. Fury Warrior are less likely to be able to Fury Dual-wield Tank as they can't allow themselves to get parried by the boss, as they will get bursted significantly harder.
---
2. Feral druids have more Effective Health and can survive more unexpected burst than a warrior would (unless the warrior is lucky parrying/blocking the 40% hasted extra attack from the boss)
---
This puts Ferals higher up on the ladder when it comes to threat per second tanks, and they don't sacrifice a Shield to do more dmg, like warriors were allowed to on Pservers.
---
Please ask if this was unclear :) 
---
I might have misunderstood something.
---
There is just alot of resentment between the races, that's why they can't lay down their weapons.
---
You have genocidal racists like Proudmoore and Grand Marshal Garithos who think all humans are supposed to be exterminated. 
---
So when it comes down to prominent leaders, the alliance has more evil characters than the horde.
---
However on an average citizen level, orcs thrive in battle and undeads want look into eradication of all life in general, so they are not good either.
---
All in all, both have evil folk who only want death and destruction.
---
It is! I look at this thing. Read that. Then look back up and read it again and think... yeah... spot on.
---
As long as the tank isn’t retarded. It shouldn’t be that big of a deal if memory serves.
---
Yesssss.
---
If she doesn't know what parrygibbing is, she's too young for you bro.
---
"EDIT: thanks for the support! It was a bit of a troll post I admit (as I will play anyway no matter what) "
---
Yeah sure ;)) good luck
---
I’ll try to go funny with it
---
Both horde and alliance fought together against burning crusade to save the world from destruction. Neither are inherently evil. Horde is definitely more violent but with an exception of Forsaken, they are consisting of tribal and warrior cultures and that just comes with that.
---
Proceeds to get 1v1 kited forever by a mage
---
What does this mean for dual wielding classes?
---
Pretty much. And we lived for these games where it was a complete pubstomp cause faster honor for winning than if you were to GY farm for an hour. 
---
We at least had a handful of horde guilds that were competent so we sometimes got good games but like 70% of my games looked like this cause people saw our guild tag and just let us pass.
---
thats what im saying dude so why does it suddenly give more attack power after i leveled up?
---
Fun fact: if you combine "pirate server" and "neckbeard" in one sentence, I stop reading and downvote you instantly.
---
Right. Here's an example.
---
You increase ilvl and all of a sudden health pools are not keeping up with damage output. This make the TTK in pvp outrageous and un-fun. So the devs go... "I know! We'll add a new stat called Resilience."
---
As I said, you missremember
---
Why dont you go to the blueposts and read their arguments for it?
---
Yes, objectively normal epic mount is superior.
---
I mained Undead Warlock back in the days, did the Questline and enjoyed it sure. But eventually switched to Wolves (first Alterac, then the black/red pvp wolf after exalted with orgrimmar).
---
UBRS key will be like golddust, #1 item for rogues
---
Jon is that you?
---
I absolutely loath the way stats are in retail. I think the sweet spot was early Wrath late tbc. I remember starting in Kara our tank had 22k hp and I was like, holy fuck that's insane.
---
Now a 22k difference in health is like one 20 item level difference. It's so stupid.
---
When an item has 4729 stamina or 4499 stamina who fucking cares. The numbers are meaningless. Nothing matters. Retail is a joke... God I could rant for hours, but it's 230 am and I need sleep.
---
It's ok guys just don't invite or join groups throughout classic and pretend people do not phase away
---
Me likey likey

Don't swear
---
I am not saying this is not a bug but that video is from a private server. It even says in the discription:
---
&gt;First off, nearly all of the footage was recorded in ONE gaming session on the evening of April 30th, 2012.
---
No, as the entire point is they are trying to authentically re-create vanilla. The infrastructure is legion, but they taught that client to read the 1.12 data. Everything else they are modifying to be Vanilla-like.
---
dude im literally looking at it right now.. its going up every level up
---
Warlocks got progressively better as time went on in Vanilla, we start off middle of the pack in all regards and round AQ40/Naxx we become absolute powerhouses in both PvE and PvP. 
---
In PvP you can go the oneshot route, or the tanky AF route and both are absolutely insane 1v1 against damn near everything that isn't rocking that Blacksmithing trinket off CD.
---
But early on we're just too immobile and we rely too much on our gear scaling to be effective, if you simply grind R10 and do normal dungeons you're MILES better being a mage, hunter or rogue IMO.
---
Tauren just want peace and don’t want the planet destroyed, they’re dealing with internal struggles.
---
Trolls just want a home.
---
Orca are just trying to find a home after years of slavery by humans and the burning legion.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King.
---
No it doesn't, its for testing not playing. Im sure it will get better but they need this to figure out how to do that.
---
Steelseries rival 500, imo a better layout than hex/grid layout, feels more natural.
---
This is clearly a bug, the layer was decided based on the last guy to join the group, makes no sense
---

As much as I love the music in Vanilla, the momentary reprieve you get when the loop stops is really enchanting.  Sometimes the "tap tap tap" of your footsteps can be as comforting as the musical score.  It always makes traveling to new areas seem much more impactful when that fire track drops, I'm looking at you, Barrens.
---
(X) Doubt. Doesnt do for me

Hi, /u/zarzer, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Popped a Lesser Health stone earlier in BFD on the torche pull room, I was at like 100 hp (less than 10%) and it crit healed me for 490 instead of 275. We ended the fight I had 90 hp left. Fucking clutch.
---
Anyone who has played EVE Online for a while will talk about how important the quiet moments are. It is hours of intense boredom punctuated by moments of intense excitement. Those moments can only be as interesting and exciting as they are because of how quiet the baseline experience is. 
---
I pilot a covert ops ship and fly around New Eden scanning down sites and hacking into cans, trying to find valuable components that manufacturers and researchers want. It is a profession that is even quieter than mining most of the time. If I find a really isolated area, I can go days without any action at all. But you better believe that when I have a billion ISK in my hold and hit a gate camp that did not show up on Dotlan, the adrenaline dump is enough to make me feel sick afterwards.
---
People do not tell stories about constant action because there are no highlights in experiences like that. They tell stories about "that one time" because it was so different to what happened either side of it.
---
Faerie Fire and Curese of Recklessness do different things in addition to the armor debuff so they stack
---

i wonder at what age your son will consider suicide cause he'd realise that his autistic dad is a garbage miserbale human being lol
---
Paladins still had the increased mount speed too, right? Crusader aura that you could go e to your party as well?
---
I look forward to it. When servers drop let me know where you go!
---
This stuff CANNOT happen on launch, wtf is blizzard doing? its not even like the beta server is running at full capacity either
---
Spot on. Only thing I can imagine is that there is some dynamic balancing of players between layers to prevent any one layer from getting too many players, and the fact that they grouped up triggered that system somehow? Will be super disappointing if this makes it out of beta.
---
I know the feeling all too well, my friend. I know the date and now it seems so far away but I got to take my vacation at the right time so it’s all good
---
You're going to compare a &lt;1% boe drop and 20% drop off a boss that's lots of groups don't do because some idiot lights more than one flame with a reward from a quest that's fairly easy to complete?
---
I haven't seen "1337" for ages. Thank you for making me feel old.
---
I crit with Heroic Strike for 427 today and I felt like a God in my 27 warrior. I got the Archeus sword from Mor Ladim quest line, and had the Dragonslayer buff, shit was nuts. That's like half a dudes health at that level.
---
Fingers crossed for World of Warcraft 2
---
As a solo player myself I was actually thinking about the Rogue, because of the Lockpick ability.
---
Imagine clearing a dungeon alone only to find a locked Chest... ugh.
---
While I definitely agree with the perks of the old system I can't help but think this is a case of hindsight being 20/20.
---
No one back then was saying "this is the greatest time ever, I cant raid at all but I love it because when I do it'll feel great” because they were probably complaining. 
---
Going forward I hope Blizzard will do what they did back then: continue to innovate. And I hope that brings is to a more balanced middle ground between the two design philosophies.
---
And on top of that, you really didnt see the upgrade in action. You can only tell by dmg meter that your dps rose by 100-200dps.
---
There's a well known screenshot of a backstab missing with 8% hit so that's wrong.
---
I’m hoping it’s something like: once a guild from either faction for every realm has cleared the raid, start a 3 month countdown to the next phase. Except phase 2, that should be quick.
---
&gt; If they are told to stop and they don't, then that is another story, but typically people listened when you directly asked them not to do something.
---
no guild kicked you for making a mistake once. Dont pull out straw mans.
---
If it’s red, it’s dead
---
kids don't know
---
just an [example](https://imgur.com/a/Yhnc3QT) for Patchwerk specially. (top10 dps: 6 mages, 3 rogues, 1 lock)
---
One image or fight doesn't prove anything, but it seems peculiar that the best guild back could not realize how awesome dps warriors could do.
---
Same, left at Wrath, tried SWTOR first but only managed 6 months, then Wildstar after which lasted even shorter.
---
I might have done most of the content in WoW Classic already but i look forward to returning to a complete game that forfills my needs of proper progression.
---
Ouija board and shots
---
Your math is off, going from 6000 to 12000 is a 100% increase.
---
But your point remains.
---
Couldn't have anything to do with the slightly older player base.
---
No I was talking about the innkeeper LFG in classic which wasn't really well known.  
---
And okay, but that's pre-TBC patch and there's a reason most people were asking for classic
---
It does seem so far even though it isn't to be honest, i've got no one else who shares my hype so i thought i would share it with you lot haha! its like i have to contain it to myself lol.
---
Nice get that vacation time on the release my bro!
---
That resets swing timer and hurts TPS
---
You are wrong. I really do! My mummy told me so!
---
&gt;Please insert floppy with label "WoW98" in drive A:
---
When you get your first azerite item your health literally doubles. Went from 28k to 50k. Fucking stupid lmao so absurd
---
The innkeeper LFG and Meeting Stones were the same system.
---
I find it interesting that they had to do tests to see what the hit and parry chances were.  I would have thought they could just look at the code and see the equations directly.
---
Rather serious name on my character, and a troll name on my pet
---
Fire Resist.  And you motivate them by having Magmadar set them on fire.
---
There’s a weekly thread for posts like these. Please keep them there.
---
This post right here officer!
---
In all seriousness as a fellow eve player i support most of this claim. The calm times make every fight impactfull and as he said once you hit the game with an equivalent of say 100gold coins in classic which you drop if you die to a gate camp.. the adrenaline rush is real and there really isnt any game out there that compares to that not even remotely, too bad you have to experience it to understand it :/
---
Hi there, just to say I love this idea given lack of guild banks in Classic
---
Have you been able to test it on the beta?  If not happy to do so
---
I would have obviously liked it to be sooner but whatever it takes to be nice and polished I will wait
---
The levelling back then was unique with its interactive options and choice consequences. 
---
I remember loving the story aswell but was absolutely bored out of my mind quickly when i reached max level.
---
Isn’t this originally a voice line that Grom hellscream has in Warcraft 3? Or am I thinking of the horde blade master hero?
---
Or maybe just any anime ever
---
TPS &gt; being alive
---
Yeah is so dumb. They did a star squish with BFA and threw it all away instantly. We should have had 38-42k health at max level, 50 in raid ready gear, and maybe 66k at end of expansion.
---
There's **no reason** to go from 20k at 110 to 389228 health at 120....or whatever the fuck the numbers are now.
---
That's an interesting one re. the looting. I may be misremebering but I actually thought that was part of vanilla. A cheeky tease for absolutely nothing! I'll be interesting to see what blizzard come out with in that regard, thanks for reporting!
---
Sorry let me be more specific, there were addons like GearScore in vanilla wow.
---
Slowly the mindless drones are starting to wake up, understanding core values once thought lost. This is going to be glorious.
---
I so much loved watching the barrage like swarm of projectiles firing into the boss. Shadow bolts, fireballs, frost bolts, arcane missiles, it was so epic feeling.
---
They probably waited too long for some people. A month or so earlier would have allowed me to secure time off from work.
---
I agree, but basically I want as little automation as possible, to make it less accessible. Basically I'm for anything really that can provide player on player interaction over player on website interaction. I think having things more accessible equals less interaction between players.
---
I was half expecting you not to have pants on
---
The old combat text is so satisfying.
---

---
Spirit yap is warlock ability unless priest also had it
---
yeah and has something to do with zul furak(sp?) as well or something
---
The announcement was 18 months ago. This is just the home stretch.
---
what is that purple arrow above one of the cows?
---
The difference being some people actually think enhancement is good
---
Not even vocal minority, just the retarded minority.
---
We have. Sort of. The vagueness of the comment you replied to implies something far more egregious than it is. 
---
On the beta we've had large raid groups (or multiple raid groups even) going into high level zones. 
---
Face tanking L5X normal mobs in Azshara or wherever isn't difficult when you have that many people and so many healers, even as a mage I've facetanked several hits in a row. So long as you aren't one-shot, you'll mostly survive when your group is this large.
---
The higher elites though? They were nearly always kited around, though again, some people have face tanked a few hits, but as I say, they were backed up by probably 60 or more people, many of which were healing.
---
I was expecting something like this. I still think vanilla raid content is going to be pretty easy, but I still have trouble believing the speed stuff does on private servers.
---
I wouldnt worry too much about making gold. If you can get to level 60, then go grinding. There are great vids on youtube about grinding spots, where even vendor trash makes good gold. 
---
I'm planning on taking skinning and a gathering prof. I'll pretty much vendor all leather till medium leather, then hold it till I need to sell it. Also, my plan is to try to save silithus or even EPL for questing once I am 60, so I get gold as the reward for the quests.
---
lmao good one
---
It sounds like you joined a private server not classic. That's cool that you made a few friends.
---
Also feral druid attack speed is lower than war (if you only use maul for max survivability it's one attack every 2.5 sec for example) so a druid will get parried far less than a warrior and so less parry haste.
---
Will be even worse for the dualwield tank.
---
naked and standing in pants! :D
---
Fucking Victory Rush, man.... Suddenly warriors went from a leveling nightmare to a leveling powerhouse.
---
i will create character with asmongold nick, I will troll the people
---
The people playing BfA simply don’t want Classic
---
mechanics returned. Try even mentioning it at /r/wow, they’ll throw a fit
---
You can’t make people accustomed to accessibility and then take it away. Retail is in FAR too deep
---
But it will make it "harder" maybe not by a lot but harder none the less. You will have to change your approach to bosses and raids, mixing the "roster" up and itemizing a little bit different most likely.
---
Going to have to gear those fury tanks first. And they’ll be triggering hasted boss attacks a hell of a lot compared to prot.
---
As suggested by Asmongold
---
..what is this interaction you speak of?
---
"LaYeRiNg Is NoT tHe SaMe. It WiLl Be FiNe DoNt WoRrY."
---
No layering. Fuck this garbage.
---
That's unfortunate my bro, but think about after release and maybe put that vacation time to some good use!
---
They also listened for Cataclysm.
---
Not that I do not appeciate the video, it was awesome. However, that frost mage was really bad - no blink, frostnova into backpeddle, no ice block, no cold snap, no grenades.
---
comes with later phase not at beginning
---
Yeah you're right its only because the actual release date got announced and that it is so soon is what makes it so long haha!
---
So you weren't able to down cthun with tbc talents.
---
Druids and shaman are really good before 40 due to travel forms but if you want to wreck faces it’s pretty much gear dependent for all tiers. If you have the best gear available for that tier you can literally one shot people
---
&gt;There's also the screenshots posted on EJ of people missing with 8% hit:
---
I thought there was always 1% chance to miss as a baseline that couldn't be removed by +hit%. So the actual hitcap was 99%.
---
I agree polished is always better! From what we can see as well it looks like it will turn our great with the dedicated team that is on the job.
---
(x) doubt
---
This is a lie
---
He ded.
---
Not trying to argue about the validity of Arms dps, but if you knocked off say, Curse of Shadows, with your Mortal Strike, then wouldn’t you need to be doing an obscene amount of damage to compensate for ALL the Warocks losing out on their debuff? Beating them out by 5-10% could just be because you took away their debuff. Even worse, your Debuff Slot use only improves your DPS, while something like Curse of  Shadows/Elements helps entire classes.
---
Why, tho? It gives the player stuff to do. Tough stuff, sure, but that makes getting it all the sweeter.
---
Source?
---
WAR was pretty good, if you think about it, it had features that are "new" in wow, like world quests and bonus objective areas.
---
They billed it as factions fighting against eachother, you could take the capital city for god's sake!
---
it never happened though - only after a couple of years when there was 2% of the playerbase at launch
---
Then they closed it down. Shame.
---
&gt;ESO allows you to play in any zone but to me this removes the danger and mystery of a game.
---
It goes both ways. In other games you don't get to do half the content because you outlevel it.
---
I love level scaling.
---
That it doesn't work and wouldn't work in WoW Classic is something else entirely... But level scaling zones can be awesome if implemented correctly (like in ESO).
---
they are old now atleast possibly 15+ years old. Thats old for a Gryphon. They have arthritis among other things. Give them a break \^\^

Wow finally a place to buy flannel shirts
---
how often do you glancing blow? and 0.2% seems pretty negligible?
---
Uu, that's a third reason then! Well spotted
---
When FFXI increased their level cap after it being stable for *years* and 4 expansions, it destroyed the game.
---
I feel you.
---
ghats a tooltip, check the actual stats
---
I've never played a private server, but I do remember giving a mage power infusion unexpectedly was enough to make him over aggro near the start of a fight in naxx.
---
Will these glancing formulae make human weaponskill more or less valuable than on private servers?
---
I heard SWG was good, until they let everyone and their grandma be a jedi.

Not much of a good kill he was afk came back to you attacking him. Not much to brag about there bro
---
Just like ally to wait till your afk to attack you then brag about how they owned you
---
A lot of players didn't know it back then either.
---
Of course they can do that, but they need to verify that what they think should happen, is happening.

But... Playing with other people *suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks*. In a general sense, I mean. Usually, you get some weirdo who has trouble getting his pants on in the morning, let alone being able to press buttons on a keyboard or being able to communicate, so I understand why people want to solo as much as possible.

I believe it was 20% chance.

.2% hit, .2% less chance to be dodged, and .2% less chance to be parried.  
---
When the mob's chance of dodging for example is 6.5%, .2% is a 3.33% improvement, and it's like a 1.5% improvement for parries.  It's small but getting 3% fewer dodges and 1.5% fewer parries in a fight is something that will add up over time.
---
I usually make a custom name, and I try to make it fit the lore as well as being easy to remember and type out for others. I'm not a fan of funny or meme-y names for my own characters since, as you say, we spend a lot of time with them; The funny wears thin, the meme becomes old. 
---
I'm also not a fan of just appropriating names from other works (though sometimes that just happens by accident; You may not know the name you chose is already used in some obscure book), because of the connections other people familiar with those works may have. If I'm thinking "Dragon Age" every time I read someone's name, that's something that I'll associate with them. I do not mind when others do it, but I do not want to be "the guy that reminds everyone of WoT", to take one example. And, of course, Xxlegolazz is a meme unto itself.
---
There’s something really charming about mismatched sets.
---
Casual man i saw 20 minute YouTube videos devoted to how dual wields tanking would be the only viable option for world firsts lol!
---
Report it bud, doesn’t sound right, the ability as I remember has a fixed amount of attack power that doesn’t scale with anything else.
---
when TBC came out T3 gear would be good until kara if it wasn't for the stamina change when WotLK came out sunwell gear lasted untill 78ish. simply put rather than at 61 or 71 instantly voiding the gear you spent 2 years getting you were allowed to use it for leveling all the way threw which was a good reward for your hard work and made doing raids all the way up untill the new expantion somthing you might want to do.
---
it also reduced the bloating of stats by a lot. raid tier stacking was also diffrent where each tier was 13ilvl in diffrance and the last boss droped one tier higher gear. inbetween and catch up raids would be half tiers like the sunwell was 6 ilvls better i belive. this meant that an entire exp pack could be a spread of 45 ilvls.
---
if you look at BfA today that is one freaking raid tier that is then voided with the next patch. so each patch now in terms of ilvl might aswell be an exp pack of old.
---
One thing that helps me control my hype is remembering that the first 12 hours will suck dicks!
---
Yeah it seems dw tanking will be getting hit like a truck in classic.
---
I was so annoyed when they nerfed that, my feral druid used it on Moroes in Kara, it was OP!
---
Haha, my guild was TFR, so close!
---
And this is why I want to recreate my classic experience as faithfully as possible by avoiding servers with famous streamers :)
---
English must be a second language for you. Trust me, the word retail is being used correctly.
---
Private servers had broken world buffs as well don't forget.
---
Commenting that like something in current wow in r/classicwow

But you'd be gaining 2-3 gold at launch &amp; level 1

Horde is anarchist savages, Alliance is order and civilization.

Undeads are the best race tho

Added in TBC
---
[In case anyone want this](http://epic-t-shirt.pixot.host)
---
Yeah, but not the pre-patch right?
---
I think it's disingenuous to post a screenshot of 400 people on a stress test and insinuate that's the final numbers - give it 'till 6 months into classic launch will be a better metric
---
I can't wait for classic though, as a 30 year old man I get to ruin my prime years all over again
---
Played a Druid in 2004 and on private servers. Had them begging to take me at 58  to raids and got showered in gear. Already know what it’s like friend lol. Some people love having utility in their raid
---
Come August 27 it will be "called JUST RELEASED for a reason", eh?
---
&gt;there was no clear developer intent that Mages shouldn't be able to sheep each other
---
Well that is debatable. The fact that different casttimes, projectile speed, stuns and interupt exist, is a indication that reflex and speed are intended gameplay aspects so one spell should in theory always be processed first. Obviously that´s theoretical. 
---
&gt;nor any action taken specifically to prevent it
---
Well that was just impossible with the server technologie back then. Modern WoW (which is at least in it´s core fighting system the same) kinda shows how effect processing is intended, given the presence of adequate technologie.
---
I disagree. You can explain this by saying "they casted the spell in exact same moment". The moment will not actually be exactly the same but the mechanics is intuitive and logically sound.
---
The sit / stand proc literally has to be explained by "person is both sitting and standing up" from game's perspective. It's logically unsound and is also some kind of Schroedingerian bullshit. Makes no sense in game world whatsoever and breaks the immersion.
---
They should fix it IMO. Simultaneous sheeping etc. is fine and is not an abuse of game mechanics, this is.
---
As pure vanilla/tbc guy who loves pvp, how do you guys on retail determine the difficulty of your opponent? In TBC arenas, first thing I usually did, was to check his hp/mana and immidiately the equipment. If I saw sunwell items equipped I knew that that guy is easily killed, however he can kill me very fast. If I saw someone in T4 gear, I knew it wont be as hard and I decided to make certain tactic based on their equipment level. Seems impossible to do with transmog, ruining an important aspect of the game.
---
Yea. If you're a melee DPS in any competent guild then you should already know not be attacking from the front. I see no difference from someone standing in fire or dying to another simple boss mechanic repeatedly. Chances are you're going to get fucked off pretty quickly. Nothing particularly 'hardcore' about it.
---
I've been playing vanilla since Classic has been in my brain the last two weeks. Taken 3 classes to level 12. Still haven't decided my main for launch so I guess I have to level even further.
---
Hordies dragged some high level mob to gold shire which fun
---
That says more about you than him.
---
I wish this is what were getting instead of Layers of Warcraft, when classic launches.
---
Go get this gear first, everyone that played Vanilla actually knows that BWL will destroy guilds and that AQ40 and Naxx won't be cleaned by 90% of the people, 40 man raid is no joke prep wise.
---
Huhuran is no joke. Cthun is no joke. Anub is no joke.
---
We'll see how many will go to Nefarian first.
---
And if you think you can randomly pug MC and Ony from the start you're wrong.
---
These stats are changing everything we knew from private and actually feels like Vanilla.
---
Little insecure, are we?
---
I miss good guild websites and intro/recruiting videos and shit. Discord is lame imo
---
This is correct. Quiver goes to a bag slot and then you equip the arrows.
---
Retribution damage is viable, it's just not optimal. It's good enough to beat Patchwerk.
---
was added in vanillla with patch 1.4 
---
i am a real vanillla gamer need no source 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Gurubashi_Arena
---
Blizzard added blanket sharding to the game, just like many people suspected from the very beginning.
---
They just call it a different name.
---
I don’t think it’s so black and white.
---
I think many will actually hit 60. It’s long and grindy, but you have clear progression, you go to this zone, kill anything that moves and do all Qs. 
---
I think when we’ll see the drop off will be post level 60. End game vanilla is not the same as any other expansion people are used to.
---
I know the horde guild Classic hopes to follow whatever server Asmongold and Esfand join so they can compete against each other. It seems like more fun for them plus it's better for the community if more large streamers are on the same server together so people can target or avoid those servers I think.
---
Ball sort of seems to be in Asmongold's court. If he were to go on a PvE server that's a hard no for the Classic guild.
---
Does this work in Classic? So far I've only seen it on private servers.
---
Eso did a lot of things right. And a lot of things wrong.
---
Sure, a lot of people love eso for the world scaling. But thanks to everything being the same level as you nothing is hard, and you can just faceroll untill you do vet dungeons.
---
There is no place where you feel threatened anymore, back in the start after you did your factions zones the mobs actually were hard, and it felt more like vanilla wow tbh. A pack of 3 you had to cc one or die.. After the fix for them soon after start it got too easy in my opinion.
---
Also no cross faction action outside cyrodiil ment you are 100% safe from other players.
---
Eso did a ton of things right though, and if you never played it you should.
---
I can't play much, but I plan to play much.
---
The brackets were changed to 10-19, 20-29 etc in patch... 1.6 from memory? Must to the salt of many level X0 twinks.
---
Jeff Kaplan was said to hate Paladins in Everquest so he didn't want them to be good in vanilla, that's just the rumor anyway.
---
I don’t think this is a bug, he got invited to a group and was pullled into the leader’s layer.
---
Got the carrot on a stick
---
Boots with the spurs (with the spurs)
---
I literally smash a bunch of keys on the name select screen. I then fill some vowels between consonants and trim it up bit. Several times usually. 
---
My favorite names came from this. Sometimes I would have one name and all my other characters would have the same name but slightly different.
---
If the name was Babyl, maybe another is named Sabyl or Crabyl. Kind of simplistic but keeps me from staring at a name selection screen
---
What guild were you in back in Vanilla? Not rtzs? 
---
Cause I’m running through all the hand of rag users I remember from back im the day
---
The thing is I don't think they even care to make great games. Just like every other company the pursuit to maximize profits is all they are concerned with. When you have games like Lords Mobile generating up to $50 million a month it's not hard to see why they are moving in the direction they are. Now with the impending ban on loot boxes in the west you are only going to see them abandon this market even more. 
---
Blizzard will never even come close to making something as good as Classic again. To them the effort is too great when they could just pump out shitty mobile games and make more money.
---
They might have to settle for not streaming the first day and not having their desired name. Maybe blizzard will allow them to name change?
---
Remember they get plate at 40, iirc 46-52 was a pretty strong buildup with filling in plate.
---
It's rather obvious isn't it?
---
On certain private server subreddit there is video of 24 minute AQ40 run. Seems Blizzlike /s
---
From my own experience, people already used various sites in Vanilla. People more invested and 'hardcore' about their current/available BiS gear used them to evaluate and plan. Sure, they didn't exist in the beginning of Vanilla, but later on they were there.
---
And they are rather optional. Same now. If you don't feel like using it and aren't in a hardcore guild, that enforces it, you don't have to. But for the people who do want to, it's a big help I would say.
---
It's worse than what the League of Legends streamers had to deal with.
---
Did you ever see what Alexensual had to deal with whenever he was trying to stream and play on a PServer? It was nearly impossible to do anything on a PVP server because there was constantly a small group of rogues ganking him whenever he was online. He ended up just farming dungeons to level.
---
He's relatively unknown compared to Asmon, it's very likely that Asmon will get perma ganked while on stream too. The problem he has, even if his fans help him not to die, the ganking will really disrupt the gameplay flow.
---
If he rolls on a PVE server, that won't stop people greifing. Just imagine a party of hunters and mages following you around tagging mobs and farming herbs you want.
---
Fortunately, 1-14 is going to packed anyway with no PVP. So if I were him, I'd just farm instances to level an on stream character with followers/subs. No ganking, no griefing. Slower than other ways of leveling, but at least he'll be able to use it for content.
---
Less than 3% faster (only the time you're on your mount) isn't "a lot faster".
---
Gotta admit, I wasn’t excited about classic at first. Then I got into a 45 minute conversation with a random group on dungeon finder. We all talked about the things we remembered about old school wow. Since then I’ve been really excited to get back into it. I miss the old world, it seemed so much bigger. I miss having the sense of community and a character that I could really build how I wanted through talents. Many other things too, can’t wait for release, been playing since original wow beta, and I want to go back to it.
---
&gt;  there was the crystal spire of karabor which was blue
---
I don't mean to trivialize your post, which I like, but remember the PvP vendors had the equivalent looks of most of the raid stuff.
---
I’m stocking up on unseasoned popcorn. They’ll provide the salt.
---
Dat blink
---
'LFM GNOMER'.....absolutely fucking epic.....
---
Hi, /u/atresj
---
Druids are a ton of fun. But so are all the hybrid classes. Paladins are super fun to play. I think the hybrid classes offer the most variety whole playing and give you tons of options while leveling
---
And that wouldn't even work for the top end builds that 2h fury.
---
I'm hoping Jeff Kaplan will take over the role as President sometime in the future, all of his ideas and design fits well with the classic design of WoW. I think it will also be good for Overwatch as they seem to need a new leadership direction with the game, especially towards the eSport side of things.
---
I want this and other stuff back in BoA. Get rid of this Diablo for Azeroth. I want my game with depth back. And passive skill trees.
---
Legion was great tbh, loved the mage tower and class halls, the only reason it got boring rather quickly is because everything is handed to you so fast, i had 3 max lvl chars levelled and high lvl geared within 2 months.
---
Lol exactly, imagine rolling on a streamers server.
---
&gt;The moment will not actually be exactly the same but the mechanics is intuitive and logically sound.
---
That doesn´t sound intuitive at all. As you said, it´s impossible to start the cast at the exact same time, so the game processes it as if it were cast simultaneously if it was startet in the same server "frame" (/or "tick"). How long this frame is depends on the technologie, or in this case of artificial spellbatching, on blizzards decision on how long one frame lasts. So there is nothing intuitive about it.
---
&gt;literally has to be explained by "person is both sitting and standing up" from game's perspective
---
The sheep thing also means "this player is both casting a spell and transmorphed".
---
&gt;and breaks the immersion
---
Doesn´t a sheep that´s stunning a mage because it´s charging at him not?
---
And there are so many more fringe examples of spellbatching effects "that don´t make sense" like caster being able to cast through walls, being able to cast a spell at a target behind them, rogues vanishing from an instant spell, Lay On Hands drainign your mana and having a cooldown although the target died before the cast resolved..
---
Basicially i´m just saying that there is no real way to differentiate from "good" and "bad" spellbatching. Eitheir they want it "vanilla like" and keep the sit thing this way, or they should just remove spellbatching alltogether.
---
Yes that is what I want actually :D
---
Less threat generation too
---
2h fury is a thing..
---
Do you have a source on them saying phase 1 will be short? I eve love you, just have seen/heard that.
---
/r/XCOM checking in.
---
Its guaranteed.
---
It's also the power creep - you mention Emerald Nightmare that no-one would run it. This is true, the items were null and void 2 weeks later.
---
Look at Perdition's Blade - a drop from the last boss of the first raid. Item level 58.
---
Then look at Kingsfall - a drop from the last boss of the *last* raid. Item level 63. 
---
That's only a 5 level item difference over the entire "expansion" of vanilla. Now item levels jump drastically even between tiers!
---
Did they really remove hit cap in BoA. Kinda glad cata was my last expansion
---
Yeah dude it's absurd.
---
I had a top 98percentile geared Holy pally, was among the top healers on my server and in the top 5 Holy paladins on my server, pushing for within top 100 on the region (NA). 8 quit for a few months due to irl stuff, and I come back and my mythic level gear is worse than fucking blues that drop in heroics.
---
The inflation is so absolutely fucking bonkers insane, it doesn't make sense.
---
Whne I logged in and saw that, I just logged back out. All motivation was gone. Going from one of the best Holy pally in NA to just some random pleb felt terrible.
---
There's no reason to double the stats on items every fucking raid tier.
---
Yeah the mystery was something really cool, BWL was BWL, not some random mode. It helped feel like the raid was part of the world because there was only one difficulty too.
---
With totem twisting you get both!
---
If you are going PvE server and get ahead of the pack you'll probably be fine - will have to grind a lot but that's the plan for most :)
---
I like heirlooms, just not in vanilla, levelling is part of the game in vanilla
---
In Wrath I like them because your talents and gear is so strong by that point every zone outside of Northrend is fucking stupid easy to the point of boring, it's nicer to have it go by faster
---
Tame a black cat and name it the same as your druid buddy to confuse the enemies.

LAP DOGS, ALL OF YOU!

How serious is the role play on role play servers? Is there a lot of ooc conversation?
---
The horde are bad guys because c'mon look at them
---
_"A journey never to be forgotten is in the past - but also on the horizon ..."_
---
Reading that line with the voice of the Dragon from BBCs "Merlin", and you got the start of a nice fantasy Series :P
---
As someone who raided as a destro-lock in vanilla, threat was something I had to constantly manage as it was extremely easy to catch up with healers and tanks if I got into a good DPS burst rhythm.  
---
Plenty of times when you'd have to jump and break a spell cast if tank TPS dropped.
---
What I'm saying is that we definitely have a clear indication that you aren't *supposed* to get an "on received crit" proc while sitting, since they specifically coded it to not happen.  So it stands to reason that any implementation quirks like batching which prevent that developer intent from being carried out would be considered a bug to be patched.
---
Now they just need to make that work smoothly.
---
"Pservers are harder, because raid bosses have higher Armor !"
---
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter. I have been saying this for ages.Vanilla was, and Classic will be harder than pservers, for a number of reasons, and this blue post add the most important one.
---
Pserver bosses resist values are lower than Vanilla. Pservers bosses armor values are a bit higher, but because how Armor works, that is maybe a 2% increase in a boss Effective Hit Points. Problem is that the Armor value being slightly higher on pservers is nullified by lower resists.
---
Pservers World Buffs are not on a server CD. On a Pserver you can pop Rallying Cry whenever you want. A wipe in a progression raid is irrelevant...they just go back to Org and get another Rallying Cry. In Classic, that is not going to be possible (6 HOURS CD on Rallying Cry).
---
Pservers abundance of Black Lotuses (due to them having the same respawn CD as a normal herb and due to dynamic respawns) allows a guild to tackle a raid with everyone using flasks. That is not going to be possible on Classic, Black Lotus CD being on a 4 hr. respawn CD.
---
And now THIS, which is the biggest difference between pservers and Classic : raid bosses having 14% Parry chance.
---
A lot of people are unable to understand what this actually means. It's not about raid DPS, that will no change because tanks will be parried more often. But tank threat and survivability will be DRASTICALLY changed because of this change. Pserver bosses have a measly 5% Parry chance...in Classic, it will be almost THREE TIMES HIGHER (280% increase in parry chance).
---
Threat won't be such a problem...FOR WARRIORS. But it will be for Druids. Druid threat will be bellow Prot Warriors...AS IT WAS IN VANILLA. Why? Well, because Warriors CAN ALSO PARRY. When a raid boss parries a hit, his next attack will be 40% faster than the previous, which means that the raid boss, during the fight will hit more often due to parry-haste mechanics...but this also translates in the Warrior being able to parry more hits, which in turn gives the Warrior more parry-haste uptime.
---
Fury Prot Warriors will not exists, except for luls. They will be insta-gibbed by raid bosses. 
---
The Private server meta of "threat" tanks will not exist in Classic. Fury Warriors will simply not exist, and Druid tanks will have lower threat than Prot Warriors, while having far lower survivability than Prot Warriors. There will simply be no point to have Druid tanks except for tanking thrash packs or boss adds...AS IT WAS IN VANILLA.
---
What does this 14% raid boss parry chance means is simple : Fights will last longer because ONLY PROTECTION WARRIORS will tank raid bosses (Druids mill be melted, while Fury Warriors will be simply destroyed), threat management WILL be much more important (there won't be 15 seconds Vael kills) because DPS won't be able to go balls-in, mana management will also be important, because fights will last longer.
---
Tanks (and I mean Prot Warriors here, not Druids or Paladins, because they weren't tanks in Vanilla and won't be tanks in Classic except for 5 men and offtanking thrash) will also have to prioritize their gear towards survivability, and not towards threat. The hit chance for Prot Warriors was IRRELEVANT in Vanilla. It didn't matter until AQ40 and Naxx, and by that time, Prot Warriors had enough survivability to use 2-3 Hit chance gear, and drop Defense gear (because ZG enchants and T2 high Def itemization).
---
Because of Shield Block, Prot Warriors won't get Crit. Fury Warriors especially will get crit...A LOT. But also Druids, probably as often as Fury Warrior, but Druids will mitigate more due to HP. Still, Druid tanks will have the same fate, even if they won't die as often as Fury Warriors, they will still die a lot.
---
Because of Parry-Haste mechanics, Prot Warrior threat in Classic will go above Druid threat on private servers, and the ONLY reason to have a Druid tank on a pserver is threat...in Classic, this reason simply disappears.
---
Simply put, the meta of Vanilla will translate to Classic : less world buff uptime, less flask availability, no threat tanks (Druids and Fury Warriors), longer fights, mana and threat issues.
---
Sure, any AQ40/Naxx guild can speed run MC with a Fury Warrior or a Druid tank...but that is irrelevant. It's like arguing that a lvl 60 can solo SM. 
---
So, there you have "Pserver bosses have higher Armor!" and "Classic is undertunned!" people...here comes Blizzard with the 14% Parry for raid bosses in Classic, which changes everything BACK TO AS IT WAS IN VANILLA.
---
Hopefully, this Blue Post settles the discussion on which was harder : private servers or Vanilla. Because it is crystal clear that it was Vanilla.
---
If you are going to mostly play solo while leveling warlocks are fantastic, if you gonna group a lot go priest if you guys don't have one.
---
Even the lower ones run well
---
If classic is going to as big as it seems to be, I'll bet they'll make a statement at the end of phase 1 to say they have to keep layering in place to have a stable gameplay.
---
Got this everytime I took a fp, had to alt f4
---
If you say so, but I disagree. It adds up when compared to the average pace of classic. Cutting 3% off your trips is useful, and in my opinion, made a very big difference over time
---
Well why choose? I'd imagine they also get premade groups going for them.
---
&gt; I would prolly sacrifice a bit of time to ground out the R10 gear, though...
---
Reading comprehension, my man...
---
There are addons for that.
---
All bad guys just want something. That doesn't mean they aren't bad.
---
I really hate level scaling. I love the feeling of going back to an area that used to kick my butt at a lower level, then just owning it because I can.
---
I’ve seen a ton of saltiness from sniping already and that’s with a small player base. Based on their reactions already it’s going to be a shit show with a lot of whining for the first couple months.
---
This is why there were no Druid tanks and Fury prot tanks in Vanilla raids...and also why they won't be in Classic.
---
Oh boy are you in for a time. Some classes have blues that are BIS for pretty much the whole game. 
---
If you're a feral druid, that's a level 40 blue piece.
---
Looks good but I know nothing of the brand lol are they good ?
---
Hunters you get to shoot and run and flip if you go NE
---
They'll come right up and blow soft air on your gpu with their filthy money mouths. Problem fixed.
---
And you got to level 16 at age of 5?
---
Impressive :)
---
I remember Asmon saying he wouldn't play on a pvp server because of this issue has he changed his mind?
---
lmao got me
---
It's also magic and gets dispelled quickly. DRs unlike crippling, frostbolt, hamstring etc.
---
An enhancement has to have won after his 3rd frost shock otherwise he's left out to dry never hitting his ranged target again until the enh is dead.
---
It also is better on elemental because of 100% increased crit damage and more +sp.
---
Elemental is everything an enhancer can be but stronger. Hell, if you want to rock a 2hander, you can go 36/15/0 and take huge dumps on enhancers.
---
Just look at how this guy just wrecks the enhancer at 08:00 minutes:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAzJqQ6QL0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAzJqQ6QL0M)
---
You speak da true true
---
And when you see idiots arguing "but players today are more informed" you understand how fucked up they will be in Classic.
---
They just don't know it yet.
---
Vanilla is STILL, today, being theorycrafted.
---
Wouldnt putting enchanting on an alt be better if you're looking into regrabbing mining later on?
---
Right glancing blows seems like a big deal.
---
But to make sure I'm understanding, is that 0.2% in addition to the already 8% hit cap? so without +5 skill, you have 8% hit, but with +5 skill you have 8.2%?
---
I thought people were saying they needed big streamers for advertising. If their intentions are to test they’ve gone about it in a strange way.
---
Me discovering your main discovering Wetlands for the first time on Vanilla WoW
---
I highly doubt anyone serious about ranking would want to premade with a streamer.
---
The enemy team could just load up the stream and go "Oh, they're trying to flank the carrier. Oh, they're going ramp."
---
No chance.
---
Don't mean to come across as rude, but I'm pretty sure the majority of the other subreddit was dedicated to the game having too few buttons to press
---
I understand your perspective but I don't share it. I think there's nothing wrong with batching and I like it also for its comedic effects. I wouldn't like to have it gone, I remember it being abe part of the game and I'm used to experiencing its effects in the game.
---
What I dislike is the fact that you can force a game to do things that wouldn't make sense in "real life" scenario. I treat batching as something that makes the game quasi-turn-based with turns being simultaneous. It's fine that charging warrior gets sheeped after stunning a mage - the arcane energies of the spell happened to finalize after he hit the mage. That is fine, that's how the world of Azeroth works and I can believe that. I can't believe that during a fight a holy knight would keep sitting and standing up to gey powered up. THAT's what's breaking the immersion. I'm not saying the mechanic is inconsistent with other manifestations of batching, I'm saying that it makes the "World" in "World of Warcraft" less believable.
---
A faster wand would still be better (for alliance anyway).
---
Judgement of wisdom was decent mana regen and using your wand didn't impact non-casting mana recovery. 
---
A high spirit 2h or 1h/off hand while 'recovering' may work better
---
Yeah, well..they will die much more often. That is the difference. Clearly you don't understand that Druid threat will drop like a rock, right?
---
If you don't...please roll a Druid tank in Classic...just make sure to have a proper healing with you when raiding.
---
Because you WILL NOT TANK.
---
Also i'm pretty sure mop numbers are wrong too, i remember hitting/being very close to 1 mil hp on my dk at the end of mop.
---
No it's more like private server players saying "I disagree, I think you're wrong about this particular thing because of my experience on private servers, it's been like this instead" and then a bunch of retards insulting and mass downvoting, kinda like how my previous post just got.
---
In fact, I'm gonna eat every fuckin http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=21028 in this room.
---
Custom name which I think sounds good on my tongue, in my head. Sometimes I use a crazy spelling for a normal name or word.
---
Sometimes the pauses, make it more meaningful when you enter a certain area that triggers a different leitmotif of the zones music. Or when you enter a new zone all together, the name pops up and the new music starts. Its better that way, rather than having the previous zones music playing constantly.
---
I had a good experiance with a druud. We met randomly in the open world and did some leveling together. It's a good synergie.
---
That is a month of 5 to 6 hr days... That's not a little time
---
I mean you'll have a time sink either way but restoration would get you there sooner.
---
Another one that doesn't get it lol.
---
Warriors, being hit more OFTEN due to 14% parry in Classic, will HIT BACK the boss more often...because WE HAVE PARRY ALSO !!!!
---
Prot Warrior threat in Classic will be way above Druid threat...Simply because when the boss hits us more often, we will hit back more often.
---
CAPISCE?
---
come on guys this is just 1 too many sunset shots
---
I think the most challenging part will be to make connections and social interactions within the time frames that you mention. 
---
Managing your gaming social activity will greatly boost your classic WoW experience. Try to get/find a friend who has the same schedule as you and level together. 
---
Having a list of friends and joining a social guild will maximise your downtime. Your guild’s goal must be: running dungeons for leveling and casual raiding + pvp farm up to rank 10 when you hit 60.
---
Except druids can't parry u bellend
---
I get that, but again, blizzard kinda went with the #nochanges approach, resulting in mobs still being stuck in trees, being able to glitch under SW and so on.. Things that clearly were bugs. Starting to fix some of them just would feel wrong and selective in my opinion.
---
It's more along the lines that people compare specs within classes, so you see elemental shamans being tier 1 if they play support and heals too alongside biiiig burst. While enhancer is just bottom of the barrel trash tier in comparison.
---
Might get a kill here and there, but elemental is just so, so much better.
---
An arms warrior with wf support has 5 times the windfury procs than a enhancer has.
---
That video hits the spot. Hopefully he will view it!
---
Is plate having an heavy impact on not losing much health during a mob fight or is it not that significant? Iirc mail to leather wasn’t such an impact..,
---
I loved it. And will get it again in classic. 
---
Can't remember but does it stack i.e. with mithril spurs? or with the pally talent pursuit of justice?
---
Thinking about making a pally farmchar with max mountspeed.
---
Please don't tell me they added the worst thing in wow retails history to wow classic? #phasing
---
I did not know that. But you barely gonna hit bosses anyway with it, it‘s more a minmax. But You only gotta get glancing blows. It‘ll be interesting to see if what you thought out is worth or not to atually play it :)
---
&gt;Nihilum themselves could come back with Kungen as MT and just shatter every speed run record and they wouldn’t have as much notoriety as asmon will have at level 1.
---
Dunno about that. Could be about the age demographics of the servers as well. I think the streamers are huge with younger people. However Classic seems to also appeal to the older guys and girls who originally played Vanilla. Maybe I'm just way too optimistic about this. But being 37, I really hope I'm right and there will be a healthy mature contingent in the game I can roll with.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but if you made a Macro saying: /sit, if already sitting stand up.
---
Pull enough mobs and spam this macro and it will work more or less just like old ReckBomb paladin for mobs!
---
It’ll just vanish when it gets low
---
By tedious I meant repetitive and boring. I had difficulty getting interested in the game because the early zones, even past level 40, were incredibly easy and wasn't offering the challenge that I craved.
---
Hydra tried it on stream but didn't seem to be working.
---
Ulduar was hands down the best way from a gameplay perspective to implement multiple levels of difficultly for the same raid.
---
Just report this. IMO it looks like a bug!
---
&gt;Will you choose characters from your favourite stories (LOTR for example)
---
Cringe
---
People will be begging for transmog if TBC Classic ever happens.
---
I think you are missing the point
---
Why would cap at at 60% more of the FPS your monitor can show? Capping it a 60 wouldn't be good either (70-75 is enough) but isn't 100 overkill?
---
I remember pre tbc patch - felguards could solo mages lol
---
I mained Dwarf in Vanilla, I'll be Tauren this time around.  My brother does not understand why I love these two races so much.  They are just the best.  Any class that can play Dwarf or Tauren will be for me.
---
Powercreep in PoE is by no means as significant as in Diablo 3 or WoW.
---
Powercreep was always there. Back in 2013 we had dps numbers you couldn't measure anymore. You just needed extremely expensive gear. Nowadays you just reach the "im OP" threshhold way easier, thats all. 
---
Small exceptions happen from time to time, but only through broken skills or mechanics, or simple overtuning. Like Pathfinder, Blade Vortex, Winter Orb at their respective peaks. 
---
Powercreep in WoW reached extreme levels, damage numbers in the millions etc. Even worse in Diablo 3. 
---
In PoE max dps numbers for single taget are around 10-20+ million atm. But only with gg gear. And even with 1/20th of that you can do all endgame bosses easily depending on build. Heck some tank builds have 500k or less and do the hardest bosses. Ofcourse bigger damage numbers are a thing, its a rpg after all. But you cant tell me that retail wow or D3 arent on a whole other level.
---
COncerning seasons. Thats totally true. I wasn't talking about seasons in WoW. Only that expansions dont need this powercreep. You could create difficulty by mechanical demanding fights or implementing new gear that helps in the new encounters. I get that its hard to do, since you need to give people a reason to farm items. And letting gear roll higher numbers is just a lazy and easy way to do solve this problem imo.
---
Surely there must be a way to hide your character name while streaming (not in wow)?
---
It does according to [Wow Parry](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry)
---
It's like you pay attention to nothing and just like hearing yourself talk.
---
Are you honestly this much of a troll or legitimately this stupid?
---
It has to be one or the other, at this point. You can't just make shit up out of thin air with evidence pointing against you before you even try waving your magic troll wand.
---
Get fucked, troll. We don't need idiots like you here. Go back to BFA.
---
Yeah the armor difference you get from mail to plate is pretty big.
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure the majority of the other subreddit was dedicated to the game having too few buttons to press
---
Oh I'm not under any delusion that my opinion is in the majority.  Though I think it would be awesome if the devs could leave in *one* DPS spec that has very few buttons to push in future content...
---
But since the topic came up, I wanted to voice my joy at getting to go back to the style of DPS that I loved when I first started.  I might even get it in a \#nochanges TBC as well.
---
Partly correct. But consider this:
---
- Lower hitcap also means higher TPS
---
- Parry haste means more damage dealt to the tank, equating more rage which turns into more TPS capability.
---
Albinosmurfs lol
---
He totally is missing the point :)
---
&gt; These systems are never ending so I feel that I never accomplish anything when I get something out of it.
---
It's a bit like comparing a treadmill to a ladder, isn't it? In both cases, you have rungs that you can climb/step on - but in one case, you actually have an upwards motion along a solidly defined distance, while the other offers only never-ending motion. Moreoever, if you stop moving on the ladder, nothing happens. You merely do not move. But if you stop moving inside your treadmill, you fall on your face.
---
In other terms: What once used to be the ascension of a mountain has become running in a hamster wheel.
---
The main thing really is that you can't do much of anything meaningful other than duel/AH/craft while waiting for the BG to start. As you need to be at a specific NPC to queue.
---
If you do join as a group however, the leader can queue everyone, so no need to be present at the NPC.
---
Why do you even think thats a bug
---
It's Theramore. Stormwind has no harbor.
---
Those specific servers will be hurting but there aren't dozens of streamers to be on every server. 
---
Just gotta pay attention to what server they plan to roll on and just avoid them.
---
As you may have started to realize, pve is easy as fuck. So I personally would optimize for pvp. And well, some axes and daggers will drop, the raid will need someone to equip them.
---
That will just lead to dead servers when the hype has died down
---
Perhaps, but we dont know for sure what the formula for glancing blows/weapon skill looks like yet.
---
&gt; and the Cone of Light thing.
---
You're being too generous.  In TBC, the only "AoE" we had was Beacon of Light.  And even though that totally screwed me in a few fights, it was worth it to have fewer spells to worry about, lol.
---
Why is that alarming? That's good
---
No and Jesus Fucking Christ that tinfoil.
---
Shut down STV with 5 guys? Have you ever played this game?
---
Quite agree. If there is a point for WotLK it isn't its raids (bar Ulduar, ofc, that place is epic) nor its PvE (badges galore, steamroll dungeons+heroics, epics-for-free dungeons later on), it's more on the PvP side, mainly getting hybrids a spot in non-healer spec in PvP settings, something even tbc failed on in most cases (ele/enh had a relative tough time outside certain niches,  oomkin/feral were underdogs compared to resto -which were actual demigods, annoying dreamstate crap-, pallies performed poorly... Only spriest managed to be good, yet really vulnerable to cleaves and poor mana management as well). Even with that, DKs were an absolute nuke to balance alongside pre-patch retardins and later on any armor pen based class.
---
Are you for real? They have already added old bugs back into the classic beta because those bugs are how most people remember vanilla wow. It looks absolutely wrong right now.
---
You´r comming from a RP perspective that i don´t share. Immersion get´s thrown out of the window when it comes to metagaming im my opinion.
---
I think we can just agree to disagree. Peace.
---
Portal isnt a multiplayer online game. Theres a reason serious competitive speed runs arent done in multiplayer games.
---
Take path of exile. Great and really competitive racing community. High interest and all. But it will never be a speed run game since new leagues and thus mechanics, items etc. every few months. Also lag, DCs etc. since its only played online.
---
Look at online competitve games. In PoE people et banned for abusing gamebreaking mechanics, same in most other online games. As it should be.
---
Biggest factor in the Online vs Offline topic:
---
Abusing mechanics, glitches, cheats doesnt affect ANYONE else in single player offline games.
---
Online you affect lots of other players and can destroy their gaming experience.
---
This is not correct, the spirit stat was not very valuable in vanilla
---
parry haste is dependant upon the swing timer of the person attacking... so a 1.3 speed dagger will give less parry-haste than a 2.1 speed sword (i dont play tank, so no idea what weapon speed is standard for 1h)
---
2 diffrent player bases sooo...
---
The only people in t3 when illidan went down was Stars. The only reason that’s the case is when the game was released in their localization, BT was out. 
---
In EU and NA you had 5/12 of a year to clear up to t5 and farm that out to only 25 members vs 40 and heroics fave raid useful gear, as did professions.
---
Stars blitzed from their dark portal opening to 70, through attunements and right into BT. They had t3 on cause they hadn’t gotten replacements—and it was good enough to see them in the door. 
---
They killed illidan first or second week of their expansion. Possibly the greatest feat ever achieved in WoW raiding. And these were Chinese not Taiwanese, so their access to the unfiltered uncensored global internet is diminished...and they’re hardcore Chinese mmo players, what’re the odds they have someone fluent enough in English to understand a bunch of English mmo jargon (boss guides weren’t just thrown up on the, new at the time, YouTube within hours—they were text guides written in forums, unofficial forums). So it is likely Stars developed nearly the entirety of their strat on their own. 
---
Then they repeated their badassness by doing world first legit Yogg 0 light—the last fight that was ever accused of being mathematically impossible. Again, arguably the best raid team to ever play the game.
---
It's cool but if you're an absolute trash player with trash gear and a trash spec don't feel entitled to go in 5 man groups
---
Just because you can get carried through MC by your guild does't mean your shitty build isn't shitty
---
Scaling world was in fact the best change they could have done at that point. No one was touching 90% of the zones and that is what happens when you increase leveling speed and allow people to level solely in dungeons. The scaling was basically the only way to breathe any life, even though it was small, back into some of the more out-there zones.
---
That's not to say I disagree with you on the other parts. I prefer a capped world as well without scaling. I love running through low level areas and not getting punched off my fucking mount by a piece of shit starter mob. I'm just saying it was a very smart and very healthy move for the game as it is right now. When a game runs for nearly two decades and has over 8 expansions, scaling the world is needed.
---
I wont
---
Its basically in line with the new line of thinking for games like diablo and POE. Just people spamming abilities chain pulling mass groups of mobs at the off chance of gear.
---
Not every server, but since BG’s are cross realm,and there will not be battlegroups due to there only being few servers, it doesn’t matter
---
And because they can't parry, they won't benefit from 14% boss parry...Warriors WILL. Warriors will gain threat because they CAN parry.
---
How hard is to understand that?
---
The ONLY reason that Druid tanks exist on private servers is THREAT. With this 14% boss parry chance, Druid's ONLY reason to tank raid bosses simply vanishes.
---
It's not rocket science man...I can break down the numbers, but a 250% increase in boss parry chance translates in a 250% chance increase in Warrior's chance to parry...which means a 250% increase chance to apply MORE threat.
---
Which will put Warriors above Druid's threat in Classic.
---
the patch reset just breeds this awful mindset in players aswell where if you don't jump back in when a new patch drops you might aswell not. what if when the new patch drops your work has you working like mad for 4-5 weeks by the time you can play you are outside unable to get in and since your preformance in the previous patch dosen't matter you simply don't have an in.
---
blizzard seems to wounder why retail WoW is dying shit like this is why WoW is dying you have ramped up the cycle so quickly that only a few people can keep up. slow the fuck down.
---
classic is super mega slow and you know what it is amazing for being that slow.
---
Yeah, I mostly agree with you. As they probably won't be in the top PvP premades. So for the people not too fond of them, it would probably be best to roll the opposing faction on the same server.
---
&gt;The enemy team could just load up the stream and go "Oh, they're trying to flank the carrier. Oh, they're going ramp."  
---
&gt;No chance.
---
I thought there was some sort of built-in delay for streamers as an option, so they would not broadcast current info. But not too familiar with the whole thing myself.
---
Sword skill is fine, but mace is just a meme hahah
---
Yea especially when its basically 1 streamer and an army of fanboys who live for following around and kissing his ass.
---
"epic tshirt"
---
text indicates legendary
---
Those are also simply higher numbers, making it not different to a base damage increase.
---
I know that it's by no means an easy task to go the way i described. And it didn't matter at the start of WoW i guess. But after so many expansions its time to really think about their design philosophy imo.
---
I use a \[Razer Naga\]([https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ecZxB3MoL.\_SX425\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ecZxB3MoL._SX425_.jpg)) mouse and an \[Orbweaver\]([https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817GlmVDffL.\_SX425\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817GlmVDffL._SX425_.jpg)) instead of a keyboard. I almost always just use the mouse to run but have strafe keys also bound to the mouse buttons and there's the dpad on the orbweaver. I accept that I have too many buttons and could simplify by using more shift/ctrl modifiers but I love my setup
---
Spiders don't have web in vanilla.
---
Just as much ooc as other realms. Most serious RP is found through joining an RP guild. Other than that, people participate in all features of the game, mostly ooc. At least, that was my experience on MoonGuard
---
Suicide by T-Shirt.
---
You can still see enemy castbars in game with an add-on. They didn't do that good of a job ;)
---
Otherwise great work. I like the healthbars distance change since at default I can't see them even within casting distance.
---
Except one thing : they will be dead.
---
Dead tanks don't do threat.
---
Actually this just makes threat more important, so druid tanks are slightly buffed by this relative to warriors, since dual-wield fury tanking is now harder.
---
You still want as much threat as possible, and druids still have much higher HP and armor than a prot warrior so they can survive bursty damage no problem.
---
You gotta be some kinda idiot to not like Gnomes, man.
---
Ye STV ganking never happened without streaming...
---
Yes I did. 
---
First of you gotta slow down &amp; take a deep breath. 
---
&amp; what I really meant by that, was that they could easily shut it down for individual players. Of course 6 people wouldn’t capture the whole zone, but what will you do if a 6 man mob will organize (probably more like 10 guys anyway) and decide to patrol all the quest mobs? 
---
What will you do alone? Yea you can call for help in your guild 2-3 guiltiest will not be enough. You’ll get bitched around by them. Fact.
---
RemindMe! 91 days "Hail hail"
---
I can afford a month.
---
It is normal and you are able to skin only certain critters. Cats/squirrels are off limit for example. Cows, deers, rabbits etc. are skinnable tho. Makes kinda sense to me. :-)
---
Also, no animals in the starting zone (except certain critters) are skinnable, I guess that is a design decision to make them uninteresting so freshly created characters don't have to compete with skinners.
---
That’s literally not what I’m saying and you should know better.
---
Can always blame the healers
---
I’d be all in for 1 “streamer free” server. I’d immediately get on there.
---
Imagine Vael tanks using a 1.3 speed weapon :))). They will take SHITFUCKLOADS of damage, even as Prot Warriors.
---
Private servers got it SO DAMN WRONG.
---
They increased the bosses armor slightly...but this 14% parry changes EVERYTHING back to AS IT WAS IN VANILLA : The ONLY raid tanks will be PROTECTION Warriors.
---
I'm going to assume you're talking about the old world flying?  
---
I can understand why people want things easier and more accessible and I can also understand why some people don't like that. Adding flight to the old world like players wanted definitely made it seem much smaller and I can understand why some wouldn't like that.  
---
   
---
But as far as the problems with modern WoW go, that is such a tiny insignificant portion of what's wrong with the game nowadays. 
---
In fact, I'd say they figured out the best way to handle flight and it's effects on the exploration aspect of the game a while ago.  There's literally nothing wrong with the way that they've done it in WoD, Legion, and this expansion.
---
I don't think this will change dps much, since dps are behind the boss and aren't affected by parry.
---
Yeah it blows that the general person that doesn't watch streams might have their entire experience of classic be altered if they wind up on one of their servers.
---
My dad played wow aswell so he helped me a lot, and I never kept leveling the same character I always made new ones 😂
---
But my issue was that only about 50% of Rabbits are skinnable - outside of the starting zone.
---
Lok'tar Ogar
---
Honestly I don't care much either way.  I'm planning to main a pally and if it's there, I'll use the hell out of it.  But trying to think about it objectively, I think they'll see it as an exploit (in the sense that it contradicts developer intent by finessing the technology) and patch it out.  But we'll just have to wait and see what they do.
---
And you know for a fact how things were? And if not you know for a fact that Blizzard already did the correct implementation of all things?
---
Level scaling made alt leveling extremely boring and faceroll. I wait for Classic system. Good to solo red mobs during levelling.
---
its common knowledge, u would be told not to stand in front of boss, make the mistake again, okay fijne, again.. .ummm... again... and u may be subject to getting booted, all this would be learned by all melee dps within the first raid they ever entered, so over time there would be less tolerance for it lol.
---
Looks like you're rolling a human now
---
I love in the beginning of BfA where the mobs were easier to kill at lvl 115  than 120...
---
What do you mean 'Legolas' isn't a cool hunter name?
---
&gt;  An absolutely critical part of the game mechanics which affects every part of raiding was off by a massive 10%. 
---
It's a WHOOPING 250% increase in bosses parry chance !
---
5.6% vs 14%.
---
It throws the private server meta to the bin.
---
I am an incel, so I dont have to deal with tgis particular problem.
---
Our guild symbol was the same as our tabard. The crossbow pointing upwards. I loved that group and the time I spent with them so much that I got a tattoo on my arm of that symbol 😄 I don't share this often but if any community would appreciate the story, it would be this one
---
They were added in 1.12.
---
I guess it's a good thing that I like to collect things like this then. Definitely going to try getting the ZF mallet and the seal of Assension.
---
You transmogged a bwl shield to look like a naxx shield? Seems odd
---
What kind of weird system relies on people manually reporting things before it starts logging?
---
Do like cartman does for the Wii
---
I would suggest a different path:
---
1. Mining/Skinning
---
2. Drop Mining for Enchanting
---
3. Drop Enchanting for Herbalism at 60
---
4. Farm Mara and get Ghost Mushies and Blindweed and 50-80gph
---
5. Drop skinning for Engineering once you have the cash
---
Spending time mining on a class that can solo farm Mara quickly is a waste of time. Getting 2 extra gold a clear is nice and herbalism is great for farming your epic mount, professions and Devilsaur gear.
---
I agree that streamers aren't the best thing to happen to the game but 'no changes' is already violated by plenty of other things outside of blizzards control e.g. us having the equivalent of supercomputers compared to the old hardware.
---
I don't plan on playing launch day because if I can wait 3 months I can wait another day and avoid the disaster it will be trying to level in starting zones. Maybe do the same and use the time to find which realms the streamers are on before making your characters? I'd guess the big ones would try to join the same server so they can do pvp tournaments and 1v1s for the views.
---
&gt;Powercreep in WoW reached extreme levels, damage numbers in the millions etc. Even worse in Diablo 3.
---
It's a little confusing that you mention damage numbers in the millions when that's where PoE is.
---
If you compare how PoE was in its early days to the current endgame it is definitely HUGE power creep. I would personally say easily comparable to WoW.
---
I would also say that in the case of PoE the negative aspect is far less, because I think originally it was a bit slow, and the type of game just lends well to going fast killing lots of stuff and doing big deeps.
---
Again, this isn't about whether PoE is better/worse for it - but simply that they didn't actually find a way around the core issue.
---
Because PoE has resets and people only play sporadically in 1-2 month bursts or less then they don't need such a big increase in power because everyone is A. reset and B. most havent been playing (read: raiding for that ilvl of gear).
---
&gt; I wasn't talking about seasons in WoW. Only that expansions dont need this powercreep. You could create difficulty by mechanical demanding fights or implementing new gear that helps in the new encounters.
---
Do you currently mythic raid in say, top 500 at least? 
---
The issue with what you are saying is that WoW mythic when you're pushing it at the level its really intended (pre nerf, pre over gear, pre catchup mechanics) is already mechanically very demanding.
---
You speak of creating difficulty through mechanics but WoW ALREADY has that. WoW has the hardest raiding of any mmo, by far.
---
If you did make things even more mechanically challenging (it's already the case that you need Weakauras etc to have any kind of a hope) then it just kills the game for anyone below the highest end. They have zero chance of doing the content.
---
So you cant take the mechanics from 10/10 difficulty to 12/10 difficulty. It's just not possible really.
---
&gt;implementing new gear that helps in the new encounters
---
Incidentally they have kinda done this actually, although only in the most recent raid is it really showing itself a bit.
---
Right now you have, f.e. a trinket called Void stone. This allows you to shield someone but the shield absorbs damage OR healing.
---
The latter part makes it generally pretty shit. BUT the first boss of the raid that it comes from has a phase where you go immune to healing. Void Stone has HUGE value for getting you through this.
---
It's also strong for the other mechanic where someone gets a DoT on them and has to move far from the raid as they AoE when it expires and deal damage based on how close they are to the raid. This means you can shield them when they are getting out of heal range/heading out and not worry as they have a large shield.
---
The problem however with new gear that helps with encounters is that it makes them less skill based if you don't have those specific items. Ergo they become more rng and loot luck based which isn't ideal.
---
The alternative is a new stat that you need in order to survive X raid - say a resist. But again, that has the same issue and/or makes it feel like an odd hamster wheel where you're getting gear that isnt an upgrade but is just the same as you already have but has a fancy word on it that only applies when in that raid.
---
&gt; And letting gear roll higher numbers is just a lazy and easy way to do solve this problem imo.
---
Imo, it's very easy to throw words around like "lazy" but if you actually look at what blizzard have tried / have done / are doing it's obvious that they aren't really being lazy. It's just extremely difficult to find an actual alternative.
---
And the ones people keep mentioning are generally very easy to point at holes in them, and show they haven't REALLY thought it through themselves.
---
The other aspect is Blizzard likely has metrics which help guide them. Our personal 'feelings' of what does/doesn't work matter less than what the objective metrics tell them.
---
Yeah I also am not a keyboard turner and never was, but I've never rebound WASD or Q,E. I just like them set as the default and I can use either if I do need to go one handed for something even just like taking a drink. Obviously not doing that in serious play but with modifiers and a gaming mouse I have more easy to reach buttons than abilities to bind.
---
I understand people rebinding them because they're so easy to hit but if there's one thing I've learned with WoW is that almost everybody has a different setup and or UI that works for them.
---
You could do that in vanilla as well.
---
&gt;"tap tap tap" of your footsteps
---
Surely you mean hoofsteps, . . . right?
---
Especially if you’re in STV, that’s some of the best music from any game or film.
---
I hope so. I still hope for 1-2 streamer free servers though. I just don’t want to be confronted with all this bullshit.
---
He talks about the boss not the player ...
---
Sure, there is such an option. The price you pay with it is stream interaction which is a quite big in the Vanilla/Classic wow streams. Not sure streamers would forego that and all the donations associated with interacting with chat.
---
Good thing im in EU.
---
If the input numbers are changed it will also change the output; so in essence yes, it will change some things.
---
The fact that people downvote this comment lmao Reddit is like a safe space for incels. You guys should really try to go outside from time to time.
---
You're just delusional.
---
If you think it takes a streamer to get a group of 5-10 players to gank in STV, you'll be very surprised whrn you actually try playing WoW.
---
Recreational purposes would include the API, so that argument is unfortunately invalid.
---
Basically, Prot Warriors will ditch out more threat than Druids...because Warriors can parry also, and benefit from parry-haste mechanics.
---
Survivability wise, it won't matter as much...because Prot Warriors can block.
---
But being hit more often by bosses, it also means we parry more often, which means we will attack more often...which means we will gain much more threat on Classic vs private servers.
---
The entire reason for Druid and Fury tanks to exist simply disappears in Classic. Fury tanks will get obliterated and Druids will have less threat than Prot Warriors.
---
Exactly as it was in Vanilla.
---
We do wanted Vanilla...right?
---
What? The parry haste on the boss will be reduced if the person triggering it has a faster weapon... So while you will trigger parry haste more by having a faster weapon, the effect of it will be lessened... So it should net the same result in the end
---
Just convert the rating in the tooltip to a percentage directly.. With the way the entire game scales nowadays having an item show the crit it gives you based on your level should be doable aswell right?
---
You'd have items that give 0.37% crit but that's still better than &lt;some random number&gt; crit rating.
---
Then unify the low pop realms once that happens.
---
Cheers Teeb
---
Ya me too
---
There’s no possible way they won’t be found. Any big streamer thinking they can hide is massively incorrect.
---
I loved the keys. I think that the keyring was as much of a QoL improvement as anybody needed. Keys were an accomplishment, and they felt good to earn.
---
The ruby is definitely the Dancing one. lmao
---
EXCEPT Prot Warriors. We will get more threat, because we can parry.
---
Not that I ever saw or heard about. What was it called / got any screenshot?
---
Forced realm merges will piss people off a lot more than a week or two of layering...
---
Just convert the rating in the tooltip to a percentage directly.. With the way the entire game scales nowadays having an item show the crit it gives you based on your level should be doable aswell right? Just keep the rating behind the scenes (it's already converted to a percentage in your character pane so why not directly on the item..)
---
Did you say...dodge???
---
(Spams overpower)
---
Man, after playing console games and looking ar trophies and achievement percentages, you realize that even in short, single player games, 10% or more won't even start the game up and complete the intro. The percentage of people who get trophies just for story completion drops further and further as you go near the end. 
---
Raiding in MMOs is like this but on steroids. I absolutely believe less than 1% of people who installed WoW ever participated in a raid bosses death during vanilla. That can still be a lot of people though, and it's not surprising if they disproportionately congregate in certain online forums.
---
Sorry, got confused when search showed the new spell icon
---
Possibly the worst bot I have ever seen
---
Nelf Priest with Shadowmeld+Mindcontrol could be fun.
---
Cant i queue and then leave the area?
---
I know. I just took this as an example how 5-6 organized players could already alter the gameplay. Realistically it’s more like 40-80 guys. Which would literally change the whole game, guys like them just don’t want to realize this because they’re most likely groupies of these same streamers. 
---
Funny how the guy ask me if I played in vanilla, while back in the days, organizing you and your 5 friends or guildies, could end up in the most crazy shit. Imagine that with a band of 50.
---
people wont spread out as much, if anything more people converges to barren because it is so good. Every race pretty much goes to barren at 12, undead may go later at 15 but even going at 12 is just as good and skill boring sepulcher. 
---
People dont really start to thin out till much later because differences in leveling speed and desolace/stv/dustwallow/1k needles are all decent
---
Same!
---
ehehehe
---
nice memory
---
Sharding destroys the experience anyway. I'm just saying it will be impossible to track so people will exploit it.
---
This
---
I will roll RP-PvP server regardless who is there!
---
I just want this kind of server from start. If not - I will roll on "unofficial" PvP-player-RP server if Blizzard is to stupid to recognize need for official RP-PvP server.
---
They'll likely fuck the economy of the realm they are on. I don't think gearing will be impacted much. I don't think PvP will be impacted much.
---
What this wise man says!
---
 &gt; you want to be part of the [Legends] Family write to me on facebook
---
Yikes.
---
I can't imagine it will hurt anymore than the classic celebrities from before.
---
I wish I kept all my Vanilla screenshots from my old PC.
---
 Community was the initiator of all the terrible features - easier levelling, LFR, easier accesible content etc. Community never knows what they really want, if you want to see the product of clueless community asking for shit and spineless blizzard mixed with greed for money you get retail wow.
---
Yea... didn’t even think about this yet... 
---
Smfh it’s just sad. Who wants to spend time watching someone else play anyway. 
---
I’m getting to old for this shit i guess.
---
The party xp ratios only apply for party members near each other.
---
Am I missing something here? The 14% parry bosses will have doesn't have anything to do with the warriors chance to parry, does it?
---
How does a higher chance for the boss to parry increase a warrior's tps?
---
Where does your proposed increase to warriors chance to parry come from?
---
That’s not how the meme goes.
---
I would be as concerned for beyond the first day. Quest anywhere and have a group of 50 people roll in tagging everything. Might as well go to another part of the zone and hope they don't follow.
---
Very controversial topic, people post this 2-3 times a day 7 days a week. 
---
Big wave of downvotes incoming (for said reason) just trying to warn you
---
My email didn't show up until a week or two after my account had been flagged. Luckily I learned during the Legion beta to just check the launcher and not rely on my email or I might have missed it
---
I know that this won't be a popular take but i don't mind classic dying and having them merge servers for the dedicated few that are left. If i get 2+ of years of content I'll be happy, i pretty much never play a game for more than a year (WoW being the exception). 
---
Vanilla servers will die if they launch TBC/wrath. So I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts and if they manage to keep it alive with sideways progression I won't mind, but either way im happy with what we're getting.
---
I understand how you'd get that from reading my post, I probably sound like a quitter who didn't even bother giving the game a chance before putting it down and that is correct. However, I have a lot more responsibilities then I did a decade ago and I'm finding it easier to commit to something for long periods of time when before it was impossible. For further context; I've tried SWTOR, ES:O, Archeage, and probably over a dozen other MMO's since WoW. From all the MMO's I've played the only ones that I got a max level char on were ES:O and SWTOR, both within the last 2 years, and I'm still playing the ES:O endgame content currently. You could make the argument that those MMOs are too easy compared to vanilla and that I will find vanilla too challenging and just give up, but in my opinion I've made a lot of progress on my inability to commit and I want to challenge myself this time around. Plus I'm going to be paying out of pocket this time around, so there's that too.
---
I like the idea of content after naxx but I also wouldn't mind seasons like diablo where you can hop on a new set of servers to start over.
---
Either way I hope we don't see tbc (I know I'm the minority) I loved tbc but don't want to quest through hellfire peninsula ever again :)
---
This sub is full of streamer Fanboys
---
it got a bad reputation but it actually did have a nice effect on health regeneration for warriors significantly cutting down on time wasted on eating and bandaging.
---
was already confirmed though
---
We don't hate him as a person, we just hate seeing his stupid face pop up everywhere.
---
The mechanics are simpler, but there are many more "you single person fucked the ENTIRE RAID" mechanics.
---
[Deep Purple is my favorite color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nAb9CfR8pE&amp;feature=share)
---
Language is a fluid, living thing. The meaning of words change. You can control language as well as you can control the weather.
---
Except due to RNG, it can be 3 in 3 hits...or 1 in 12...or 2 in 9.
---
Point is, Druids and Fury Warriors are fucked, because the RNG will cause spikes that only Prot Warriors can mitigate, with Shield Block.
---
Being UNABLE to foresee the spikes in boss damage leads to a single LOGICAL conclusion : Druid tanks and Fury Tanks will not tank raid bosses in Classic.
---
EXACTLY AS IT WAS IN VANILLA.
---
If some dirty horde is going to /e me I'll kill them twice instead of once.
---
I don't think he got the numbers through any real data. They were also refuted by Blizzard - although I guess they would refute them either way.
---
It's cool to hate.
---
Some are envious, some just want to troll, and some genuinely dont like him (orwant to seem like they dont).
---
He says some things I dont like, sometimes, but I think he is a decent person, all-around
---
Spiky damage from boss parries can be tough on bosses that already hit quite hard (Patchwerk)
---
Also that parry chance ain't no joke especially on an opener if a tank is unlucky with parries and gets some big heals
---
&gt; Vanilla is STILL, today, being theorycrafted.
---
maybe by your gang of people standing infront of everything and punching it because 'the face hurts more when i get hit at it'
---
That’s exactly why I stopped posting on this sub. The stereotypical behavior in this sub is unbelievable from times to times. 
---
This really is r/classicwowincels
---
I use a Corsair Scimitar Pro, I think? I really dig it but it's 80 USD. Comfortable mouse though and my previous Corsair mouse lasted me a really long time and I still have it as a back up because it still works, just wanted an upgrade. Really like the 12 button grid.
---
Here's a link

---
Isn't it a good thing for promotion of the game though? I think he predominantly shows the game in a good light. Those who dislike him will find a different streamer but the hook worked?
---
Ohhh a meta post about being meta?
---
You just assume they are on your level, tbh. With how many tools and build guides are available these days, people are all running the same shit, so it's safe to assume they are in the meta spec/gear. The meta is also found much faster and very few people outside of top end raiders/PvPers even bother to experiment, and when they shift the meta, a guide is posted and everyone shifts with it, tbh.
---
WoW gets a lot of hate for making bad choices, and they do, but a lot of it really just comes down to the game being so fucking old and saturated with all kinds of content and overflow of gear, mounts, zones, dungeons, raids etc. that a lot of changes may suck, but are absolutely NEEDED. 
---
Transmog wasn't needed for the sake of the gear itself, but to keep people playing. A lot of people don't even raid or PvP, they literally level characters and go farm old content for transmog gear now. It was a smart and necessary change to keep certain people playing the game. It also lets them be lazy and not make good-looking sets anymore because everyone is going to transmog fucking Vanilla-Wrath tier sets anyway.
---
Other stuff like world scaling was put in to keep 90% of the zones from being ignored. Since the level cap is now at fucking 120, they had to increase leveling speed and allow you to level in dungeons because people wouldn't do it otherwise. These are changes that feel like shit to a lot of players like us and we hate it, but are the consequence of an mmorpg lasting 15 years.
---
Rofl, it's the same thing expect you see all on your realm unlike layering.
---
I'm sure we will see TBC at least. But they need to make a completely new modern game with lessons they've learned, if they want to expand the audience of Warcraft Universe.
---
Look at the left half of the gif. Random artifacts appear for a few frames that are different from the background.
---
Yes. But the NPC's are in major cities. So they are surrounded by low level areas. If the queue time is long, you might actually get to somewhere meaningful and do some farming/leveling. If the queue times are shorter, you probably can't make it very far.
---
Also, if I remember correctly, when the BG ends, you end up at the NPC you queued at, not where you were when the BG started.
---
Possibly even more if you just switch layers when you get to the chest
---
Short answer to everything:
---
1. They will do fresh servers after a period (every 1-2 years) 
---
2. IF Classic is super successful they will release TBC with one way char Copy/transfer
---
3. no new dungeons/gear the classic way 
---
3a. The power spike between a fresh lvl 60 and naxx is now already really big, if you give ppl stronger gear there is no chance for a fresh 60 to compete in any way
---
3b. vertical progression for making hybrids viable is bad because (almost) all bad PvE specs, shine in PvP (ret pally, spriest etc) wow's problem is the balancing of both, pve and pvp
---
4. hell no classic QoL like dual spec it doesn't fit the theme and people will grab their pitch forks and torches if that happens
---
He could well be speaking about the dungeons etc.
---
On beta they were pretty damn challenging. Before live they were nerfed to hell because the player base couldn't handle it and complained so much.
---
Its not about this patch. Its about gear. Once certain classes reach AQ they become stronger due to scaling. Rogue is gonna stomp in the first tiers on Classic due to gated content. Hunter is gonna be even more insane.
---
some of the streamers want to play on the same realms so it probably won't be as spread out. i'm sure there will be at least one realm with no streamers at all ^^ in fact most streamers play on pvp realms so i imagine a few pve realms will be safe
---
I wouldn't say I HATE him. For whatever reason, he just kind of annoys me. I'm not really sure what it is about him. But I'm not trolling his videos or anything - I just don't watch him anymore.
---
And yeah, it's a little annoying seeing his face pop up a million times a day in this subreddit.
---
Classic CONFIRMED easier than Vanilla.
---
Yeah I definitely don't agree with some things he says/does but overall think he's an entertaining streamer and didn't understand the pure hatred.
---
Seems like anytime he fails to do something there's a tonne of videos coming out, almost celebrating it weirdly...
---
How would that ruin the game? Come on...
---
&gt; Who wants to spend time watching someone else play anyway.
---
Why would anyone watch people play any sports ever if they can play themselves? You honestly can't see how people can find streams entertaining/fun/etc?
---
It's just like any other form of entertainment.
---
I use the g600 and recommend it to everyone. It's budget friendly, rgb and really sturdy. My 2 nagas broke less than a year after purchase and were really buggy in game (would randomly accelerate mouse speeds) which made for annoying game play. The g600 has yet to fail me and I purchased it 2 years ago.
---
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
---
\+5 weapon skill translates in 1% hit chance, 1% less misses, 1% less parries and 1% less dodges.
---
It's basically a 4% hit chance increase for a +5 weapon skill.
---
Main reason I chose Orc Warrior over Tauren for tanking in Vanilla. And private servers. And will also do it in Classic.
---
Did you talk to him beforehand?       
---
It's almost a reflex for me to decline invites from randoms unless they've said something beforehand.
---
It takes a while to change you. No one will jump on the game and instantly become socially cooperative.
---
That also happened in Vanilla. Can't win them all.
---
This is the great thing about video games: You get to choose how to play the game.
---
In the same way you're choosing to play it by grouping up with strangers, he's choosing to go at it alone. Stop being such a hypocrite.
---
Lol he didn't need your dirty ass help ;)
---
It's satisfying to watch such a cocky retard fail at damn enar everything
---
Hi All,  
---
We are a group of three ex-hardcore raiders looking for a guild for Classic. Two of us are former members of Immersion (Raider &amp; Officer) both with multiple top 10-15 World Kills; the third is a former ScrubBusters raider.   
---
We have booked several weeks off from work at launch to level, gear in pre-raid BiS, farm consumables and work on professions. Planning on rolling Dps Warrior, Mage and Hunter on launch.  
---
Ideally we’re looking for a hardcore or semi-hardcore raiding guild doing 2 days a week (possibly 3 during new content / having an optional ZG / AQ day). Monday, Wednesday and Weekends are our preferred days raiding in the evening. Looking to clear all content in a timely fashion but not necessarily requiring server first kills.  
---
We have a preference for Alliance but for the right guild would happily play Horde.  
---
As a small aside we all have vanilla raiding experience having all played since release. In addition we have levelled characters on p-realms in the past and are part of the Classic beta test.  
---
Look forward to hearing from some of you. Feel free to message me on Discord Hazbuk#4989.
---
They'll impact world bosses and world pvp. Maybe they'll impact your levelling but unlikely as they'll be trying to level/gear themselves. Their viewer raids will get crushed by guild raids. So long as their opposite faction has some strong guilds then I don't see them being annoying.
---
Not true. At least not yet. I have not seen any signs that "retail" has become pejorative. 
---
The etymology is simple: there were "private servers" (usually free) and there was "retail" ... the real game that Blizzard made and you paid for. It's a holdover term stemming from a large amount of pserver people being the "voice" of Classic WoW. Not to mention that you now have TWO versions of the same game... they need to be called something. Classic is what Blizzard called it out the gate and, for the most part it stuck (you will still see people calling it Vanilla, which isn't exactly correct). At the same time, Blizzard called retail "Modern WoW" but since retail had been used for FAR longer, it didn't stick. I would also point out that "Modern" by itself is not a great handle... and who is going to take the time to type out "Modern WoW" each time? Nah. You need a one-worder.
---
Classic vs Retail just works better than Classic vs Modern, even if it doesn't make literal sense.
---
Calm down there, T-Pain 🤣
---
I like your optimism
---
Well, he is popular. Popular people are popular among haters too.
---
It could Indeed be a solution but it has sommes drawbacks too :
---
- doesn't feel nice to see "+0.2" Crit chance, although it would be the same than a crit score it feels better to have a round number. I don't remember vanilla items having "+0.25% Crit chance" for example.
---
- your item stats would change while leveling. Your Crit score value as % heavely change in BFA while leveling. New players would feel cheated if their +2% Crit item became a +1.5 Crit later on for no reason.
---
Idk, imo it's not a superior version of the Crit rating considering you can see how much Crit rating you have and how much Crit chance it gives you.
---
There may be a way to make it work tho, but it would take more than just a tooltip change imho, like the number of secondary stats on an item (if you only have 1 stat then maybe you could obtain things like &gt;1% Crit)
---
&gt;How hard is to understand that?
---
&gt;It's not rocket science man...
---
And yet you are completely wrong, even though the post was extremely clear about it. 
---
The BOSS has 14% chance to parry YOU. Your own parry chance is exactly what it says in your stats. This has no effect you YOU parrying THE BOSS at all.
---
A confirmed bug that is not layering getting so many rage replies in this forum gives a stark indication of the toxicity of the classic player base.  
---
How do you claim this is layering?  They all see the mob, one is invited to the group and then it disappears for all of them? 
---
 If it was layering one of the people would have to be on a layer where the mob is not spawned.  They all see it, bug.
---
You got it wrong mate.
---
Only when I pulled the boss and took the tag, he instainvited me. I declined obviously.
---
The vanilla community is full of would-be streamers with 0-1 viewers on average. They hate anyone who made it big.
---
Yeah, this. If you want to ask about a streamer everyone hates then you'd be asking about Towellie, and the answer would be: he's shit, his vaping is obnoxious/annoying to watch, he uses his stream as a Google assistant... I'm sure I could go on but eh.
---
\#nochanges is a community thing. Not once has Blizzard prescribed to this philosophy.
---
More likely they'll delegate ppl who like a genuine MMO RPG to classic and make retail casual friendly with its continous mobile game design. I'd be fine with that, i mainly want the gaming industry to realize that there a dozens of us who don't want their stupid always online, player retention capped daily grind simulators. That we actually Do want what we want, like singleplayer games, or wow classic. Them telling us what we want (many companies can be quoted as saying things like ''players dont want singleplayer experiences'' etc), is pissing me off so bad. We do want them, regardless of how badly they want us to want their low effort auto content.
---
Haven't played Retail in years. Now resubbed to chill a bit and maybe get into Beta. Once Classic rolls out, going to play it with full focus.
---
The point is parrying him.
---
I see a guild called &lt;Goldshire BDSM club&gt; bottom right..
---
What the hell, alliance?
---
yea, just funny that when I took the tag, he had a 180 change of mind.
---
You're forgetting many of us didnt play vanilla, but got into wow later, only to hear non-stop about having missed the golden days and how it all sucks now. This talk has been going on since cata.
---
With the way levelling changed over the years, I too am familiar with some parts of the levelling experience. But mostly I rushed through it, because there was nobody around me. End-game was where it's at.
---
I remember doing the discover achievement, so I flew around the whole map and discovered every little part of the world and I realized there was so much I just hadn't done, but it made no sense to do it. 
---
Playing a fresh vanilla server, I hope to experience and discover and fool around for the first time in a world I only ever heard stories about. For me it will be the first time. And it may not be the same thing for you as you've already done it, but you will experience first-timers all around you. You will experience levelling with people who genuinly step foot in Kalimdor and EK for the first time in their life and look around, instead of looking at the arrows that lead them to where they need to be, like dogs on a leesh, like they're used to. 
---
The experience won't be the same for you, but that doesn't mean it won't be just as good, perhaps even better? You're gonna be a sage. A live encyclopedia, you'll be helping people out left and right and that will be an awesome feeling :)
---
I’ll keep this answer short.
---
grind baby grind baby but not the levelling kind...
---
Well I understand people watching streams of Dota, LoL, Starcraft etc. You know, where every game is unpredictable  and you can actually learn from watched games. 
---
But watching asmongold popping pimples while killing boars. Yea no. I don’t get it.
---
A few years down the road, they can do what they like. Just as long as that doesn't involve wiping servers, which I see suggested more often than I should.
---
I seem to remember Blizzard reps talking about vanilla ice cream, and saying how the servers would be around as long as the company was. Why on earth would people want to turn classic into a neverending loop of "Gotta get to Naxx as fast as possible!!!"?
---
Sure, he'll probably bring a lot of new players into the game and that's a good thing for sure. I don't really hate the guy personally, I'm just tired of seeing the clickbait thumbnails on youtube and reddit.
---
Might just name them after precious stones or some other group of things.
---
It was broken as shit at 70 too. I remember having a really hard time fighting Feral Druids as a Warrior because Mangle hit so hard even in Bear. They nerfed it significantly eventually but it took a couple months.
---
Clasicsucks
---
Ya and all of his fans magically got into beta... yep it makes sense.
---
Fair enough, can easily see why people will find him annoying or dislike his stream persona and just don't watch his content. I guess the bit I'm struggling to understand is when people tell him to kill himself out of nowhere and the flood of content full of hatred.
---
In my opinion, it wont matter much unless you care about the integrity of a server's economy. What I mean by this is that if a streamer receives help with regards to levelling professions and/or getting the epic mount, it puts them at odds with 'normal' progression speed. In terms of gearing, while a streamer may be at level 60 ... unless they have at least another 10-15 geared level 60s outside of blue dungeon gear they'll struggle to get gear via raids. 
---
I don't think it's so much of an issue. Personally though I want to avoid it. Luckily I'm EU .
---
People dislike him because every other post on this subreddit is “asmongold reacts to x” and it’s just blatant advertising. 
---
I’m fine with him doing his thing, but it becomes fucking annoying when this subreddit becomes a promotion platform for streamers.
---
Blizzard - LET US SELECT EACH REALM LAYER AT SERVER SELCTION AND GIVE US QUEUES.
---
I don't get why they MUST have phasing in 2019 - who gives a fuck if I can get invited to a group and just phase into their layer... FORCE me to log out and select which layer they are on and let me join a queue.
---
Seeing things disappear and reappear makes this game exactly like BFA, and we already have that option.
---
Stop being afraid to add queues and force people to coordinate when and how they play together... especially when "this will only last a few weeks" right???????
---
Cross realm bgs were in vanilla
---
Well obviously. Him reacting a certain way does say alot about him. Doesnt make him wrong any more though.
---
Was gold-for-xp available at 60 right away in vanilla?
---
Pserver people are some of the worst testers. They are way too jaded by incorrect data to accurately find bugs.
---
Classic will run patch 1.12
---
\*Customer service voice\*
---
*"Did you try to log your character off and on again?"*
---
People are too stupid to realize that his stream persona is an act.
---
I was wondering yesterday whether it would be possible to turn TBC into level 60 content, with the raids just adding tiers
---
Is he actually a cocky retard though? I feel like a lot of the times the cockiness is a clear troll as he often says something cocky and looks at chat smiling just to see how people react.
---
Is this a joke or what
---
I'm late to the discussion but what exactly is the argument against Pokimane getting beta access? It's a huge win for blizzard because of her enormous fan base. Giving the beta access to people who have played the game for years isn't as beneficial to them. Two reasons:
---
1. Said veteran is gonna play classic whether they get into beta or not.
---
2. Said veteran has already played classic, versus Pokimane and the viewers that never experienced it.
---
It became a troll after getting flamed for it
---
cat durid is for FITE
---
Never watched him so I can't speak for him specifically. But I'm sure he has some sort of quality a lot of people enjoy and like watching. It can be humor, specific skills or the community etc.
---
If you look at the raid frames it seems they didn't have many warriors besides tanks
---
i have a bank full of my rogue weapons from raiding all the way from mc to start raids of cata. transmog would have saved me some space
---
Yeah that's fair I guess, popular people will always have their haters but it seems like the number of haters for his stream is huge in comparison to others, maybe it's because he taunts it a little.
---
Success breeds jealousy. I would expect that a lot of people would prefer to earn their living playing video games. But for various reasons, they don't. So if someone is successful at this and racks up a lot of $$, people love to hate them for it.
---
PS! I'm not really familiar with him or his streams. Or with streamers in general. But this is my general understanding from all the discussions I've seen/heard about streamers/streaming.
---
Thank you for reporting it. I'm 99.9% sure this isn't what Blizzard had in mind.
---
If I never heard Saurfang, Putricide or LK/Fordring talk ever again, I could die a happy man. I say this as someone who went hardcore in Wrath and consider it my favorite expack, it's just fucking old at this point and I STILL don't have fucking Invincible after about 300ish runs. Fuck that place.
---
&gt; Data gathered from the beta seems to indicate 65% 
---
It is because how RNG works. The data might show 65%, but if there were more beta servers, some would show 75%, some 77%, some 63%.
---
It is 70%...if it's lower or higher it's due to RNG, lvl 30 cap and short testing time. In another 2 weeks, this 65% will get close to 70%, and in 2 more weeks even closer. Raising lvl cap also counts.
---
Etc. Etc.
---
I thought battle groups were only introduced in tbc specifically with arena?
---
I mean I've played AV all vanilla long and then some. I probably remember more than I can properly classify
---
Here's a solution. Blizzard works out a partnership with Twitch and just figures out a way to instantly "layer" any player streaming with more than XX,XXX viewers. ;)
---
I had Uther's Light on my hunter. Was quiet useless most of the time,but I had no other trinket. Saved me my life once on an elite where my pet died.
---
Thanks, with extra thanks for not releasing this as a 20minute video.
---
Increasing debuff limit increases raid dps as well as forgiving people by over debuffing the boss and pushing important debuffs off. Tactical decision/keeps the 'dps requirement' roughly the same. Information is already going to blitz bosses hp.
---
Are you mentioning classic api things such as target lowest hp player in group and cast heal? Those semi automation things seem standard to remove.
---
&gt;Gotta admit, I wasn’t excited about classic at first.
---
&gt;been playing since original wow beta, and I want to go back to it.
---
Idk how anyone that experienced original Vanilla could not be excited for its re-release from the moment it was announced. Especially considering how terrible retail WoW is.
---
Don't worry too much about it. Asmongold defends layering so it must be beneficial to the game.
---
Mages will be frost for MC/BWL.
---
Lol okay kiddo
---
^ tru
---
Hell yeah, such a doucher to actually try to invite you after the fact.
---
He overtakes people in the right lane.
---
They sent out broadcasts about how they were going to be messing with the layering during this recent stress test when it first started.
---
I remember at one point after like 3 years wow brake, new xp released, i join as with every wow xp.  
---
I started leveling from 0, and got to do a dungeon at like lvl 40 something, playing warrior, got me an AWESOME axe, one that i clearly remembered was pure bliss to have back in the days. Literally 1 hour and some levels later i find a better weapon and i felt like SHIT. I remembered how cool it was to get a new item and use it for days and actually feel your character improved by a lot!  
---
WoW is shit now. Trivialized shit with shit human interaction, thanks to all of these QOL improvs. Fuck that, i want my clasic back.
---
I mean old school runescape has lasted why wont classic wow?
---
Fair enough, I guess I don't follow it so closely to notice it as much
---
I guess? I haven't played since TBC so I'm not really about to compare to recent fights. Really just comparing private server videos to my memory.
---
Because all forms of mass whining are equal? And it is impossible that mass whining in an inappropriate forum about an inappropriate issue could be pointless?

1.12 it was changed to 5 players across the board except for actual raids.

I hope to remake the leatherworking chest piece that requires finkel's skinner and the hide of the beast. I, too, look forward to being able to "feel" upgrades again!

No thanks.

i thought it was targeting you for a second there which made it more hilarious
---
Yeah I played eve for years. The only way I Can make it understandable for wow players is imagine in pvp if everything in your bags  or you had equipped and not left at the bank was lost when you died. Then you had to grind all it all over again whilst the other pvp side looted your corpse and took your stuff . Ill take a wipe and large repair bill anyday rather than that haha
---
 Finally if you think you know rage on comms， the sheer terror of getting your arse handed to you by your Fleet Commander because you lost all the Fleet  ships due to your mistakes is something to behold.
---
Read them and decide.
---
refusing to help when others need it, but asking for help when he does. yea, that’s pretty much what it’s called being a douche
---
Yeah I know :)
---
And things will most likely be fine, come release - but my thought process here is that extra feedback with video evidence will probably help them tune it so that it's not as jarring
---
A bit but because of things like spell batching (evaluating spells every 50ms only) the extra latency to US is not as bad gor playing in classic. 
---
I had eu friends playing in US and im currently on a us private server and it's okay.
---
Note: it can still be a slight disadvantage in PvP but for most not really noticeable
---
play 24 hours at launch, your now ahead of the pack and the chance of a gank is decreased by 99%.

I started in Jan 06' and I'm 26 now.

All I did was being retarted and expored all day not understanding anything + I'm grumpy already.

Does this mean my arguments have credit? If so I can now finnaly awnser all these "WhAt ClaSs ShOULd I plAy?!" Treats.

Have to pick a spec first then pick the talents that benefit your playstyle the most :)

He seems like a pretty disgusting person in real life too. Have you seen how gross his room is?
---
To be fair, alot of gear in vanilla overlapped several content tiers. Ironfoe dropping from a lvl56 boss but being amazing well into late BWL/AQ40. HoJ being one of the best trinkets up to Naxx. Band of Accuria being one of the best melee/tank rings thru all of vanilla. etc.
---
They don't even have a fury warrior dps'ing in that example. They have one arms warrior and 3 warriors in wrath tanking.
---
Naxx bosses with 14% parry in Classic...vs the joke they are on pservers.
---
Yeah..."what will everyone do after they clear Naxx?"
---
LMAO.

i have zero knowledge of runescape , is it thriving today ?

I only recently watched a few of his reaction videos.
---
Seems like an ok guy to me, nothing apparent to hate.
---
He's saying what he thinks &amp; gives his opinion bluntly; that doesn't go over well with the 'my right to be offended trumps your right to an opinion' crowd.
---
I like him.
---
If the boss parries, the boss swings back 50% faster.  The only impact the tank's weapon speed has is that faster tank swings mean more chances of the boss parrying.
---
Dude thank you so much
---
Imagine actually caring that much about how clean a random person's room is.
---
Stop being such fanboys and praising ignorantly, of course TBC didn't do that, all vanilla content was relevant in TBC, even some raid gear and leveling was EXACTLY the same, it was literally an expansion, vanilla but better. Stop praising blindly just for the hype, I'm tired of this dumb posts
---
the current direction of WoW retail indicate a path of no return toward diablo like WoW future
---
We cant know for sure under which circumstances that was recorded. For all we know, the person might have gear switched during that raid and forgotten about it. Rogues switching between use-trinkets and DFT being one possibility.
---
Or perhaps Blizzard did make a silent behind the scenes change that we dont know about.
---
Was it undocumented or talked about anywhere? It’s not in the patch notes.
---
I ordered a Ultrawide 1440p 75Hz

The reputation bar at 999/1000 is reward in itself.

Curious how this will work in classic, I did Shendralar exalted twice in BC, must be a pain in classic when you likely can’t solo libram ingrediences.
---
Brainlet here. Where do you get the other 5?
---
IIRC it's only the very hard-hitting ones that have specifically designed spike damage mechanics on tanks which parry haste would interfere with. Patchwerk and Broodlord Lashlayer come to mind.
---
Mobs can dodge when attacked from behind, maybe they used to log as miss?
---
Yeah I realise it now from some of the posts here. I guess what I find difficult to understand with this is why would you hate the streamer, when it's his viewers who try to benefit from these sort of posts/videos?
---
Imagine thinking I care. It's a fact to call it disgusting, that has no implication that I care.
---
\+ having it would let you bring it to boost low level guildies slightly more effectively.
---
Server first...13 hour raid. That’s a hardcore guild, the people and mentalities you would have been playing with (if you were even actually in this 13 hour Naxx raid...) are a different beast entirely from the VAST majority of WoW raiders. 
---
If you were in a naxx25 server first run, you undoubtedly had BT, if not extensive Sunwell experience. Else why would the servers best guild need you in the raid, or know you in the first place? If you were coming from that sort of environment and got cleaved and did something like up up a week 1 Immortal run, I’d feel justified in kicking you too.
---
great reply , i wonder how the economy will be on a mature classic server.. will it become a high bar for new players ? all in all i love the classic server concept , as bored retail players can roll on classic or vice versa and blizard get increased sub count.
---
Never said you couldn't. There were plenty of addons for stuff available through script changes.
---
Ah. I don't get that, either. I don't like him, so I don't watch him. (Sometimes I'll dislike random videos of his to get YouTube to stop suggesting him.) I certainly never tell anybody to kill themselves, or even comment on his stuff in general.
---
I'd guess that there are people like me, who don't like him, and are getting tired of seeing him pop up EVERYWHERE. People on the opposite end seem to treat him like a god, and those people are just as messed up.
---
He said BiS until 30+. It's blatantly untrue. Besides those two weapons, the Lvl 29 [Corpsemaker](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6687) has a 40% drop rate and is extremely superior to Verigan's Fist. Lvl 29 BoE [Cobalt Crusher](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7730) is usually inexpensive and a good alternative to Corpsemaker if you don't want to spend the time running RFK.
---
Verigan's Fist quest is not "fairly easy to complete". It's a huge time burden. If it weren't for the SFK step in the questline, I would reconsider. Leveling from 20 to 29 is so quick that it isn't worth spending 2-3 hours finding the group for SFK and running there. It's better to rush to level 29 and get the Corpsemaker or Cobalt Crusher than wasting all the time to do this quest.
---
How does it feel to form a group for SFK then have the group fall apart once you have already ran all the way to the entrance? Do you sit in Silverpine for 2 hours trying to form another group, or do you leave and run all the way back once you've formed another group?
---
I wasted more than 3 hours (and a lot of effort trying to form groups) trying to do this quest on REDACTED (using world chat) before giving up and soloing it once I hit level 29 and had a Cobalt Crusher. 
---
You all can try to romanticize Verigan's Fist as much as you want, but people with actual experience will realize that it's a bad weapon because it's a waste of time.
---
and lol? They won't have threat issues as mages until they spec fire for aq40 and naxx.
---
Worth noting that in Patch 1.11 Shield slam got a buff to threat so MC/BWL/ZG/AQ will be different to Vanilla in terms of TPS.
---
I'm guessing pservers added 1.11 around the same point vanilla did too?
---
It's okay you will get your way catakid :)
---
rank 10 is easy to get, past rank 10 is when you need to play often and everyday.
---
you can get rank 10 pvping 1-2 hours a day, it will take a couple months but very doable.
---
On that topic, I just stumbled on Gahz'rilla's TCG art and WOW that thing is thicc compared to the ingame model. https://i.imgur.com/DiArL3X.png
---
Been wondering the same thing, bro. Gonna roll on RP-PvP realm (if Blizz adds then at launch)
---
Thanks a lot mate 🙌🏻
---
Fury tanks will be basically suicidal. They will get OBLITERATED, because RNG. They could get 3 parry-haste in a row, or one parry-haste every 5 hits...or whatever.
---
The spike damage will be unpredictable, and Fury Warriors will die even with 4 healers spamming heals.
---
You'll be far more wanted in premades as support. You'll have far more impact on pubs as support. Often pubs literally come down to which side has more healers. If it's 5 healers vs 1 healer in AB it's literally a non-contest.  
---
Healing isn't as fun as melting faces but it's very very effective.
---
according to [parry-haste](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry), it's 40% of the ATTACKER'S weapon speed, but does not allow the reduction to go below 20% of the ATTACKER'S REMAINING SWING TIMER.
---
"After a successful parry, the defender's "swing timer" is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed (or even reset), unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining."
---
Maybe that website is wrong? But that's what I'm basing what I've said on
---
Perhaps. Atleast on Horde side. Alliance wont have any issues anyways due to Salvation.

Top 10 pictures taken before disaster
---
No heirlooms from 1-70 is fine, but honestly going up to 80 and now 120 without heirlooms was pretty aids. Especially if you are one of the many people that level massive amounts of alts and have to do it 10+ times. It makes complete sense why they added it. In current WoW, I think heirlooms are fine. They didn't ruin anything and if you don't actually like them, you can not use them. Leveling was also sped up, as needed since the level cap is so high, so it's not like you would get the same satisfaction upgrading gear since you level up 1-2 times per dungeons at low levels and would basically be putting on new gear nonstop. And if leveling speed was Vanilla level, then it would take a year to get to 120.
---
I definitely don't want any of this shit in Vanilla. I think we can all agree on that. Heirlooms, Transmogs, World scaling etc. weren't designed with Vanilla in mind and wouldn't work there. These were changes made because WoW itself has been bloated with levels, gear, zones etc. and pretty much NEEDED these things to even be tolerable. Fun isn't even a factor, 1-120 at Vanilla scaling speed would be a nightmare. No transmog system also gives us nearly no reason to farm old raids either, making all the old raids useless and most of the dungeons useless outside of the 1-2 times you see them as you level up etc. etc.
---
That about looks like what I remember as a ret paladin in pvp.
---
Yeah that's one thing I noticed as well. I mean having only watched his streams since the beta launched (and not daily either), it's quite clear to see there's a clear streaming persona being put out there. And that's not a bad thing, most people that I watched do it. You can clearly see it with him when he says something controversial, trolling or baiting and looks at chat which is clearly on a different screen so he's just trying to see what the reaction is and either follows it up or drops it.
---
You're absolute right, of course.  Verifying that the clients are outputting the intended numbers is very important.  It's just that the way the blue post was worded made it seem like they had to run the tests to get the dodge/parry numbers in the first place.  I would have expected them to say something more like "The intended behaviour is X, and both the reference client and beta test are delivering it in the same way".
---
Maybe I'm just overthinking it though.
---
Holy/disc ofc. Shadow is just good for 1v1 it's bad for battlegrounds as you'll constantly be oom and most of your dots will be dispelled. No premade is going to be asking for a shadowpriest but they will want 2 healer priests.
---
First time i hear about this, do u have any source on that?
---
Why are the other players mad at him? He did literally nothing wrong since it's unintentional behavior. In addition, what has being a streamer to do with it? Humans are so irrational.
---
I played Shadowbane and you dropped everything except equipped items when you died and lost all your buffs. 
---
Farming for 12 hours for a single resource and having enough money/stuff to buy any endgame item and seeing people pop up on your track (basically a radar) gave such a huge rush
---
nop.
---
That's fine you just can't have a space. Good luck grabbing it on the 13th!
---
Wait, what? Sorry, I honestly can't tell what you're saying here. Are you saying classic will be plagued with realm wipes? Or that retail will be? Either way, that makes no sense - that would piss off too many players.
---
[source](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry)

i was being realistic , as i am one of the people that will resubscribe to WOW because of classic.. i would rather play in classic than in my current retail state (legion) where i cant even finish my demon hunter quest line past 102
---
Yes it does. If you invited a person with ilvl 400,but you wanted 405...if he arrives to the instance, you are more likely to give him a chance. If he plays well, is a decent person, you might talk to him again.
---
Or, if a person pm you you might go, oh I remember him! I inspected him in org.
---
You care enough to bring it up as if it's a thing that matters.

That's actually about what it's supposed to be:

I don't want to get too deep into the under-the-hood workings of WoW servers, but here's a super short version. Any action that one unit takes on another different unit used to be processed in batches every 400ms.

Rethink? 
---
Nope, just go back to Vanilla. Who were the ONLY raid tanks in Vanilla? Protection Warriors.
---
Who will be the ONLY raid tanks in Classic? Protection Warriors.
---
No need to rethink anything.
---
Just understand that the reason why Prot Warriors were the only raid tanks in Vanilla will be the same in Classic.
---
Oh, and I am sorry for Druids and Fury Warriors that somehow believed that private servers were Vanilla, and they hoped to tank raid bosses in Classic.
---
Ain't going to happen.
---
what im saying, with every expansion its like blizzard cutting off more and more and making it simplified arcade game in mmo setting..
---
I was. Nolifed beta for some time now. Memory said "this is going to suck big time" - played Hunter in Beta - buying arrows, no fun advanced mechanics in skills, feeding your pet, taming another pet and waiting to learn new skill of claw, no pet customization - you have to have fast attack speed pet, the fucking weapon skills when you change your bow to gun (and I had to run to TB to train fucking gun skill, come on!), stupid dead zone, stupid limitation of laying traps only out of combat. Super primitive boring quests. Or playing Warlock - dots don't crit, don't scale with haste (well untalented corruption scales a bit with haste rofl, so sad), the fucking soulshards taking up inventory and the need to farm them, intellect basically doing fuck all while leveling (meanwhile other classes get damage increase on their skills from str/agi, what the fuck is this retarded design choice?). I was sure this is going to suck donkey balls. 
---
But this is single handedly THE best MMORPG I've played in the past 9 years and one of the best games overall in recent years.
---
private server isn't classic.
---
Good, that's where ret paladins belong: In the bank with deserter debuff. Let the real specs PvP.
---
I think it’s more to prevent ridiculous naming conventions like Healadinlolz etc, your names seem great for RP.
---
OH, okay. Totally agree with you there. But I was just referring to classic in my original comment.
---

---
Not the term I would have used but you do you.
---
LOL NO !
---
The other way around :)))
---
Hi, /u/SatelliteShed
---
Makes sense if it was 8.6% since the last 1% of hit chance would actually give you less than 1% additional hits.
---
If you don't care about pvp or raiding it doesn't matter just pick whatever you like. You can quest and explore with any spec.
---
Call it being beat down over time I guess. As they slowly neutered it, I didn’t notice until I really thought about it.
---
Go Frost and combine shatter/ice shards/Frostbite. This will give you really high burst damage while also giving you quite a bit of control over the mobs you fight.
---
Wasn't Broodlord one of those bosses that had parry haste disabled, precisely because it had a specifically designed tank burster attack which parry haste would make too random?
---
Me two months ago: I just did a crit for 60k. Is that... good?   
---
Me yesterday on my warrior lvl 17: wow! Crit for 105! Now thats what I call dmg! Also, check out my new pants +4str +4 stam. Look out girls, big gear coming through.
---
buggy behaviour of new technology in a beta?  MMMMADNESS!
---
Oh boy I never realized I could have problems with my names too.
---
I'm in a similar situation, considering playing on a RP realm for the first time and I too use names similar to your, they sound to me so fitting with the characters I create.

I hope someone can shed some light on this rule.

---
I guess that's true to some extent but there are streamers who have become successful and don't have nearly as much hatred thrown towards them as he does which is why I created this thread.
---
Perhaps it's because he isn't a brilliantly skilled player in wow and that increases the jealousy bit because people assume if you're popular you need to be godlike at the game? Probs many different things here that influence it.
---
I have server first naxx achievement.  How the fuck did it take you 13 hours.   Shit was a joke.
---
Preach brother! Definitely the race I feel the most affinity with. My main will be a Troll in Classic but I will undoubtedly roll a Dwarf at some point... on a PvE server that is!
---
I don't see the phrase anywhere in that quote. Help me out.
---
&gt; Threat won't be such a problem...FOR WARRIORS. But it will be for Druids. Druid threat will be bellow Prot Warriors...AS IT WAS IN VANILLA. Why? Well, because Warriors CAN ALSO PARRY. When a raid boss parries a hit, his next attack will be 40% faster than the previous, which means that the raid boss, during the fight will hit more often due to parry-haste mechanics...but this also translates in the Warrior being able to parry more hits, which in turn gives the Warrior more parry-haste uptime.
---
Why would the bosses parry % being higher translate to warriors parrying more and getting more attacks in? Just because the boss has a higher parry% than on pservers doesnt mean warriors do. Why would this affect druids negatively in the way youre saying? From what I gather youre just wrong, this makes druids better, not worse.
---
Currently raiding with a 9/9m guild, but thankfully they're aware and as cool as they can be with me leaving once classic comes around. 
---
Came back late legion to wait for classic, and had a bit of fun in bfa but now, now I'm just treading water and waiting.
---
Very quiet oceanic server that offered free xfers to get away from queues
---
You can technically raise your weapon skill to lower the chances of enemy dodging, but vanilla has extremely scarce supply of gear that gives any weapon skill at all.
---

You can't have a name that consists of multiple words, but if I think names like Moonglow, Greentree will be accepted. There remains a slight chance of getting reported by a neckbeard and having a forced name change, but I think you'll be alright.
---
I mean... if they're already detrimental to the current game, of course they will hurt Classic... or rather the realm they play in...
---
 I don't say this because I'm a parrot who all it can say is #n0cHaNgEz but because of the tremendous impact and power of decision they have, which in my opinion exceeds what anybody should have in a breathing world like Classic's.
---
I hope they all cram themselves into one realm, otherwise I'll seriously consider playing on EU for Classic
---
I did the morning email check and sat straight up in bed. Only to be disappointed.
---
I didn’t know how much I wanted this until you mentioned it! Damn!
---
Thanks for your reply! What are you looking forward to this time around?
---
Add-on does this.
---
Priest or paladin. You just stand in the back and heal/dispel and they are always wanted. Druid is abit more nuanced and have slightly weaker healing than those two so I wouldnt pick it if I was new and wasn't 100% sure about it.
---
IMO Classic will Sky Rocket like the biggest twitch release the last couple of years, because EVERYBODY and his mother played wow at one point in their life. Many people come in, not many will stay due to leveling and the slow paste.
---
Retail is surrounded by so much hate now from everybody. The "classic community" hates retail, all the older people hate retail, even streamers who play retail, complain about it. It has 0% appeal to someone who played classic to try out BfA. Even if they like the idea of a MMORPG they would more likely play something like Black Desert or Elder Scrolls.
---
Bonus Story, stop reading if you don't care!
---
Imagine having a smaller brother/cousin/friend. He tries out classic because you told him for 3 months straight how great classic is going to be. He tries it, after a while he doesn't like it. The odds of him playing retail all by himself is very low and also the vast majority will not say, yeah retail is so much better than this. So he will turn on wow overall and play different games.

Patch 1.10: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
&gt; In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten. 
---
In short the dungeon were uncapped at the start, cap to 10 in 1.3 and then 5 in 1.10
---
Wow you sure showed him with that reply
---
Maybe we'll be fortunate enough to meet in game! I'm glad your guild is so supportive.
---
This dude fucks
---
Just the slow death I think. They bled it out for so long I didn’t think about how much was lost until I started really discussing it with people. I never believed it would actually happen. Then it did, and I’m astonished by how much I want it back
---
Just as you showed me, Hooray!
---
And it's the truth, he'll get is ignorant way :)
---
Maybe the bluntness is part of the issue to some people and something I actually find to be a huge positive. Something I would hate more is people saying something against their belief just for the crowd to cheer and approve of. Like when he said recently that every big twitch streamer who streams for 8+ hours 5-7 days a week for a few years does it for the money not because they 'want to share with viewers' was quite blunt and controversial but actually, made sense.
---
I was pretty open about it when I joined and they needed someone to tank/flex so it has all worked out nicely. Currently being replaced but at least I managed to get CE Jaina and both the mounts before I go!  
---
If you're on EU realms we just might meet!
---
Wait, shadow is bad for bgs?
---
Im fine with mostly being in a healing spec but if it's the only option (and shadow sucks) then I'll have to pick something else I guess.
---
I wish it wasn't the case that warriors are top tanks and dps but all healer classes have no good dps option. No wonder people dont roll enough healers
---
The devs listening to the fanbase was the downfall of WoW in my opinion. 
---
The issue with "listening to the community" is that the percieved community might only be a vocal minority. It often is hard to tell.
---
My original name from back then that I ditched in wotlk.
---
I was not aware of them adding straight "bugs", as I do not obsessively follow every change it tidbit of information.
---
You can't help but wonder how much Activision had to do with things.
---
No no no, Rift is the WoW killer!
---
Bullshit. Show me the numbers for "much more threat".
---
No I totally understand your point of view. The problem is calling people cata/wrath babies when they’re not agreeing with you.
---
Yeah the good thing about Classic is that you don't go far with that kind of attitude, either you learn or you pretty much end up on everyone's ignore list, good luck trying to progress that way.
---
I get it ,but once classic is released then both games are available at retailers , do you get my point ?
---
Abilities do scale on private servers as well I think.
---
Same thing might be happening with shaman weapon enchants.
---
No idea if it actually was in vanilla.
---
That's what someone thay replies with a "No" gets.
---
Smile.
---
Don’t forget your Mithril spurs! 
---
Honestly, the thing I’m most looking forward to coming back is the glowing bright wood staff. I spent so much time trying to get that thing that it pretty much became my main objective in vanilla for some time.
---
play private servers
---
Shaman gets slow totem at what lvl ?
---
That's hilarious, gonna try when I get 10
---
If you mean the phrase "#nochanges", then yes, Blizzard never used it. But I think it's pretty clear they are committed to the *meaning* and philosophy behind it.
---
Classic is a preservation project. It's bringing back Vanilla so people can enjoy it again (or the first time). It's not "Vanilla+".
---
Ion also said that they hold the data "almost sacrosanct" (in the Restoring History panel) and won't change it. He also said that any additions are out of the question. (One developer said that they are "open to community suggestions" but he is not a decision maker and more than likely was just caught up in the moment.)
---
People might not like it but yes, Blizzard is pretty much "#nochanges".
---
(And no, "layering" and whatnot are not arguments against it. Blizzard decided (rightly) that they cannot just release 1.12 again. They must make some changes to bring the game and make it actually playable within the constraints they set for themselves. All those changes are very specific for that goal and won't go further.)
---
 People like myself watch Asmon for the humour and engagement with the community (Like his transmog/mount competitions on retail.) Just like you said, it's like any other form of entertainment. People tend to watch streamers for their personality, regardless of what game that streamer currently is playing.
---
Please do explain o master of the english literature.

Very nice - I wish more ppl actually tried to find bugs, it was a BETA and still I only caught Monkeynews and Perplexity running bugs, trying abilities from different angles, while jumping, standing still, running etc to see that stuff worked in all situations - most ppl that gotten the BETA just ran around promoting the game on twitch - I guess this was the real intention of Blizzard. I just hope we wont get a layer cake for entire Classic, I hope X-realms wont make ppl farm AV for rank 14, I wish certain things wont make horrible ppl exploit the game and blizzard ending up not caring cuz its a big personality on twitch. There are many things that are not working as intended and its no way that Blizzard havent caught them before releasing the BETA - does this mean the "obvious bugs/non Vanilla stuff" is ment to be in Classic WoW? It seems as if they hevent really done that much since I tried the demo compared to now in regards of sorting stuff - and they announced release date already. I think many many of us will be happy that Classic is coming out - but at the same time we feel its sad that they had a 2nd chance of making the worlds greatest game ever - and decided on stuff that was the beginning of the end of WoW - like X-realms. 
---
I wont just spit out shit cuz I understand that this is a way of them trying to avoid "dead realms" but isnt it better to leave stuff like that up to the players? I mean you got people playing with 200-300 others on Ally side vs 5k pop on Horde side on some servers from Vanilla to Wrath and liked it - they could migrate but didnt - small super tight community.
---
When Blizzard tries to make choices "for" the players - is when everything goes wrong. 
---
I´m thankful for being able to play this game twice in a lifetime - but for everyone that thinks Vanilla will be relived in Classic - you are wrong. Vanilla is Vanilla and CLassic will be something else.
---
I hope that Blizzard wont keep going "Well - I know we aimed for that, but this will just have to do - I mean, Classic is better than no Classic right?
---
Instead try to actually get us as close to Vanilla as they can.
---
I always supported Blizzard cuz I understand most of the stuff they do - if not I try to put myself in their position and understand as far as I can. But right now - they are not hardcore gamers - they are acting as sellouts, handfeeding people that dont know a 30 minute CD from an always use on CD ability.
---
I did my part to support you and add value to the game - always showing love and positivity - but Im down to my last cent and Im not sure you guys earned it
---
I didn’t make a mistake. Nothing I’ve said depends on people keeping their characters once classic releases, but that’s all you’re capable of focusing on. You’re the one out of the loop and talking nonsense.
---
Well its just a free name change long as the original name wasnt anything offensive. WIN WIN.
---
Pretty sure that's just faded purple text though I see why you'd be confused
---
Always thought about this. The way streamers play the game, with those big crowds following them, must get tiring. I just assumed they would have an alt that they play when they aren’t streaming
---
I just hate the idea of mythic + dungeons in retail and all the other difficulties. 
---
Like what is the point of doing mythic + 20 just results in some serious high gear. 
---
I am down for 1 raid difficultly just make it hard. So when you actually achieve something it feels good or if you can't but see someone else you know they worked their ass off
---
Enjoy Onys. Was a ballachhe! :)
---
less than 3% is not a big difference in time.
---
If this made it more difficult instead of easier, then your mind is already set on a warlock. So you should go with warlock.
---
Higher, but because how damage reduction formula for Armor works, private server bosses have a slight buff of between 1 and 2% damage reduction to physical damage. Irrelevant.
---
Problem is that pserver bosses have much lower resists...
---
All in all , Classic bosses will be MUCH harder than private servers.
---
14% parry vs 5.6% means A LOT more than 8.4% less threat for tank. It means that there will be no Druid and Fury Warr tanks, which means longer fights, which means more mana needed, which means more time for fuck ups.
---
Add in the 6 hr CD for world buffs in Classic (no CD on private servers), 4 hr cd on Black Lotus respawn in Classic (normal CD like any other herb on private servers) and you will get the picture.
---
Druid tanks and Fury Warr tanks will exists on private servers only.
---
Not in Classic.
---
I think most people here probably never heard about Asmongold until just recently, and don't get  that he's playing up a stream persona.
---
You should be fine. These names are much more aligned with the RP spirit than random first names or the stuff people obviously have to start coming up with after the more common names are taken. The rule should exist to counter names like 'Ieatpancakes' and such, which have no RP value/spirit in them.
---
As a shareholder, I assure you I want my shares to be worth as much as possible. If they can get sub counts up by having fun GMs, I am for it.
---
I look forward to all the prospective feral druids who don’t realize the massive pain in the ass farming mcp’s will be...3 for a 4 min fight. Able to get 5 loots of the mob an hour and it’s a 40% drop...according to pserver databases. 
---
So averages out to 2 an hour. Let’s assume 4 minutes a boss in mc your first few weeks. That’s 40 minutes of crowd pummeling or 27 pummelers. At a 2 an hour average, that’s 14 hours of farming just to perform for 40 minutes of combat.
---
That’s beyond an unreasonable amount of time to farm every week. The vast majority of druids won’t do it. And their tps and dps will suffer.
---
But w/e it’s the same neckbeard no thought mentality that gets us pre bis lists where 1/2 the gear is of icy Wrath. Or the offhand is a of ___ Wrath Drakestome from ST. Meanwhile no list or guide discusses how the player, say a warrior should approach the reward from the fordring questline...what dps/tank priority for loot in raids are you, how long would you wear the tanking chest piece vs the dps neck? What are comparable upgrades to each, where are they and which alternative is a less worse alternative. 
---
Me too thanks
---
There's quite a few such as "the bomb" mechanic in MC/BWL, where you can literally blow up half your raid (if not more) in an instant if you aren't paying attention.
---
So there's quite a few fights where your weakest link, can be your downfall.
---
Modern raids, rely on more on the strategy, more than individual performance.
---
There isn't going to be a devilsaur mafia at all, because that's just a private server thing.
---
To believe I had a equipment set called Ferrari..
---
Can't wait to try classic again
---
Totally understand that, I recall watching a video or stream where he says he doesn't really care about people who make a good buck off these videos from his stream which I think is what you're referring to, as something popping up everywhere.
---
Maybe that's a big problem and something he should address, a bit of a double-edged sword though. Making his own YT channel with these videos would limit this flood of attention grabbing videos as he can just report them for copyright infringement. On the other hand, people like myself who are not wow players and accidentally stumble upon a video after video from different people end up clicking and watching some, ultimately leading to his stream.
---
Still, it seems like it bring more negativity to allow this flood to happen even based on the posts in this thread.
---
I quit during MoP and never came back. I'm looking forward to classic.
---
So much cringe, I love it! But would never wear it in public.
---
And what are you referencing that is wrong?
---
Don't buy from this it's a scam site they sell pixelated shit
---
Actually makes sense, thanks :p
---
Whatever the case may be regarding the paid services, I still don’t see how a race change every 60 days hurts any of the game at all, the rest of my post wasnt addressed. But whatever.
---
Do something no guide tells you. Full arcane, for instance. Then respec to recommended spec after 10 or 20 levels. See what is better and what is worse after that.  Then try fire. 
---
Not only will you try different playstyles and have more fun, but you'll know more about the mage than a player following usual builds.
---
No, you're still not getting it. If the tank uses a faster weapon, they are attacking the boss more regularly, so they are proccing parries more and therefore taking more hits. Therefore slower weapons will be better for survivability.
---
I think it definitely calls the pirate server meta into question in a big way. It's going to make a big difference to boss DPS and tank threat, which means raids will need more healing in Classic than on pirate servers and that DPS warriors won't be able to do as much damage.
---
Given that dumping healers and stacking DPS warriors is the pirate server meta, I think we just found a major part of why the pirate server meta is so massively divergent from the real vanilla meta.
---
Every system in existence probably. A program just does what it's told. It can't reflect on it and say "wow, I should have done that, better report it as a bug".
---
Speaking as a realm-first 25-man hard mode completion on Ulduar (from the opposite side of the fence), I quite enjoyed that there was a 10-man "normal" (basically a story mode) version of the raid.
---
I didn't feel diminished by the fact that most guilds could clear 10m normal, just due to all the added mechanics in the 25m heroic (as well as rewards).
---
I also felt it was a crime to not let people see this beautiful bastard of a raid. Even my other favorites (Naxx and Karahzan) weren't as interesting, well-crafted and amazing story all in one.
---
Too bad the endgame consisted of doing pvp in the capital tavern or ganking lowbies fresh of the boat from the starter island.
---
With proper endgame in place that game would have been awesome
---
If Pservers are overtuned, Fury tanks might still be viable
---
And you lose your name and guild. Sounds great.
---
I am happy for heirlooms to increase the experience gained, but they should not equivalent to blue gear. It makes questing and dungeons too easy, not challenging. Getting questing gear is dull as it is inferior to heirlooms
---
Heirlooms should affect a slot but not the gear. They should only increase the experience gained , no stats
---
*waddles
---
You have to ask yourself a question if the name being a single word makes sense in the context of a character. If you're running a Night Elf Priest and her name's Moonglow I think nobody will bat an eye to that. If she'll be a Druid called Greentree it will look like trolling.
---
I think the topic is debatable because it is very race dependent. By default your character's name is what people call you - and you can see this in in-game texts and NPC conversation as well, for example quest texts can mention you by your name. Orcs have a habit to call themselves by their last name (Hellscream, Blackhand - the son, Doomhammer etc.) but Night Elves not necessarily so.
---
Remember that you're playing RP in Warcraft universe, not just RPing for the sake of RPing so while you can get really creative with your character's history you're still supposed to be limited by the world constraints and those constraints apply to your character's name also.
---
Going by your agressive tone of writing I'm not sure if I should agree with you or not :P
---
Here's the thing: from Blizzards point of view they don't need many testers. They are the ONLY PEOPLE who truly know what was right or wrong as they are the only ones who have the reference client in their basement somewhere.
---
Now what would happen if you let a bunch of bleeps into the beta?
---
1. numerous non-bugs would be reported (see influencers...)
---
2. people would "try out classic" in an unfinished version, discarding the "final product"
---
3. There's a moderately high chance that people would burn themselves out by the time classic actually comes out
---
There's some upsides, of course. Some people who have been very much classic community people for years should all be in this beta. But random people - like you and I - who really just wanna play again. Quite frankly no, i don't see why we should be inside the beta.
---
And just to come back with this sub vs. unsub debate for beta. Quite frankly this is some kind of quality assurance for Blizzard. The people who are paying to play the game are simply "more invested" into the game than other people. They ARE more likely to report bugs. It's been proven numerous times that free betas / demos are a BAD THING
---
You think that is funny?
---
Becuse your reply was so much better :thinking:
---
Am I not? How am I not? The parry haste is not guaranteed to reset it... It just reduces the timer on the next swing... But the amount it reduces by depends on the speed of the weapon... So a slower weapon will proc parry haste le ds but when it does proc it will give a greater bonus to the boss...
---
People getting worked by his persona. He's really good at living the gimmick.
---
So you're wrong about me saying they needed him. It's all written above and can be verified.
---
And now you've avoiding the question on what you mean by saying I'm out of the loop in regards to everything being wiped out at the end of the beta.
---
Yet I'm the one talking nonsense?
---
You gotta take into consideration that the armor values might be lower now, since on private servers they have been set arbitrarily higher since we had no clue what the numbers were
---
Well its a good thing it won't be around forever isn't it.
---
Its really ridiculous to have to wait an entire summer
---
Most of us either dont have work or its a lot lighter in the summer, having to wait all summer jacking off and only being able to play when work starts pumping or uni really annoys me
---
talents
---
Stress test has a level cap. Once at level cap all quest exp is converted to silver/gold I believe.
---
&gt; parry-haste
---
How the fuck have I spent so much goddamn time in this game and I am just now learning this... I feel like an idiot
---
Maybe, I think it's quite clear when you watch the stream though, unless people just play it in the background. Having said that, I did get to watch the videos on his YT channel where he talks a bit more about himself, streaming etc.
---
Shadow priests can take on a lot 1v1.  But I remember having the most fun with a smite priest in BG.  You can light people up with some monster smite crits and then your heals make you very hard to kill and obviously help your team far more.
---
If you're against a competent team yeah it's not that great. Shadow is meant to be a 1v1 spec. 
---
But the healing specs for pvp is slightly different than it is for raiding. A pvp specced healer priest can still kill people 1v1. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusAioobxtcc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusAioobxtcc) this is what a pvp build that you still can raid with would look like. It works best for group pvp but still has potential to 1v1 people if you just pop power infusion.
---
Where I work we have a button you must press to save logs 10 min prior and after the press. If it were to constantly save logs you get about 1GB/5 minutes of the system being alive. Multiply that by 1,000 test benches and you have 1TB of data you must transfer every 5 minutes, and 99% of it is useless.
---
I read the post but couldn’t see the image because I was on the tube. 
---
I knew it was the carrot on a stick regardless. 😂
---
What the fuck? I completely addressed your “hurr durr I didnt technically say the word need” and then you ignored that in the subsequent comment
---
Play semantics if you want. “Help” means he adds value and he added no value. 
---
There are big Beta PvP tournaments that people are gearing for. Go be clueless elsewhere
---
Yeah that would be why he said he has unfinished business
---
Guilds DID use Druid tanks in Vanilla. There's some examples here and there and it's not due to Parry. The content is already laughably easy.
---
The main reason why Druids were not commonly used is simply because they talent rework and available itemization over the course of the game only made them viable near the end of the game.
---
At that point every serious raiding guild would already have had a well cemented tank core and would have invested a significant amount of gear into their Druid healers.
---
It's simply down to inertia in how players percieve a class after changes.
---
The Lighting and shadows are fucked beyond belief in many zones at the moment. Since they don't use the old source code they need to manually add the old graphical effects back in. 
---
If they remove the detailed shadows, ambient occlusion and add more "mist" or "fog" + tweak the colors of those it could look nearly identical in that regard. It is really flat and bland in some places and in in others it is too detailed.
---
You should join my organization the Majestic Anti Gnome Alliance (MANA for short, G is silent, and you know politicly loaded). MANA:s goal is acting like a militia keeping gnomes out of Ironforge. The ultimate goal would be for the gnomes to once again settle in Gnomerregan leaving all alliance cities for the better.
---
I hope you're not in the oceanic region, that's all I can say.
---
How many friends do you have? go with that number, you will reach 60 at some point anyway, no reason to leave anyone behind.
---
Don't you get 5 from talents? From combat tree I think
---
Oh boy, 4% more attack power for Blessing of Might!
---
Which just happens to be 0.8 rounded down!
---
0 Friends right now.
---
What makes you think those exact same people aren't going to do the exact same thing in classic?
---
30/0/21 Ele/Resto hybrid Shaman is both a good healer and has great burst and totem support. Gearing isn’t that hard either as you are the only one who gets caster mail and every raid wants a lot of Shamans. The only negative is the mediocre farming capabilities and the need to respec between cookie PvE and PvP spec, though you can get away with raiding with the hybrid PvP spec as long as you are not in a caster group and you use a lot of consumables.
---
I watched the video from the mages perspective the other day. I actually felt a lot of joy every time he capped the flag. Watching from this guys is just funny but I totally get how he feels.
---
Grate on the L. Take care
---
Yes indeed. It will be a net-loss in terms of raw TPS capability.
---
If you get reported for that, it's because someone had a petty vendetta for you, honestly. Or, because they want your name. 
---
It's different if you were to call yourself Pizzanoodle or Notinhere or Thatpaladin. These things actually offend people. But your examples are 0815 last names and people will just assume that you are using that because your desired first name was taken.
---
The opposite is true though. You can transmog your high-end PvP or Raid gear into other gear, effectively hiding your strength from your enemy. And in Classic you cannot see the exact health of your enemy by targeting them, so what their gear looked like was important
---
Increases stealth speed up to a blinding 30% slow.
---
Btw worth mentioning:
---
EU server
---
Polish nationality (i speak fluently in english)
---
Im going to nolife farm rp for AQ gate
---
&gt;I look forward to all the prospective feral druids who don’t realize the massive pain in the ass farming mcp’s will be...3 for a 4 min fight. 
---
The fuck?
---
You need 1 MCP per boss, and for most bosses theres no significant benefit to even using one because of the mechanics of the boss.
---
For a full AQ40 I myself would only use a Pummeler on Fankriss. For BWL I would only use one on Vael and Broodlord. Besides it's completely besides the point. The spec does not get less viable because you are too lazy to farm your raid consumes.
---
I hope if they progress into TBC they add the option to copy your character across to the new TBC realm without removing it from the classic server.
---
He also announced wow classic at blizz-con 🤷‍♂️
---
That's cool, but which one are you gonna main?
---
What I dislike the most about heirlooms is that it completely makes you ignore the most fun upgrades during leveling (weapons for me). I would prefer it if they changed heirlooms to a xp bonus and dmg bonus as a buff rather than gear so that while youre questing you can still get upgrades constantly.
---
“Most of us?” 
---
So everyone here is a teacher or accountant? Because I think a lot less of this sub is 12-21 year olds than you imagine.
---
But yes, as a teacher myself August release is pretty disappointing.
---
Thank you kind traveler!
---
e I think the TBC is next move to keep sub ppl and kill retail. If they make TBC server 100% im in.
---
But he isnt level cap...
---
Hes not wrong though. People on reddit think they're the hot shit and that they're the core audience in every game and they're not. You, on this classic focused subreddit, are part of a minority. The number of people total who want to play wow pales in comparison to most modern games. MMOs are an already niche market, every change in wow has been to open the game up more to a larger audience.
---
End of the day, for most people they're only coasting off of hype. For most people they really do think they do but they dont. They just dont post online about it. They're going to play wow then find it's not for them and stop and we'll never know they even bothered.
---
Except blizzard, they know. They have the numbers amd the metrics and that shapes every decision they make. In the end, they want money and they're going to get more of it the larger the audience for their game is. We shit on bfa but we're quick to forget that it's still the largest mmo on the market, at least until Shadoebreakers and even then. We shit on blizzards decisions but they're still making more money off wow than they did 15 years ago. 
---
They're not stupid, they know what the audience wants and if anything I think their biggest fuck up is that they still listen to vocal minorities at all instead of just doing what they want and going for the bigger pool of audience. 
---
My honest prediction is that if classic succeeds, retail will only become more casual and player friendly.  For the relatively few but loud complaints they'll just say"go play classic". We're going to see more mobile integration. Simplified gearing, gamified dungeon design, simplified specs  and a singleplayer minded story campaign. Pick up and play will be their new creed. Theres no room for long winded immersion in today's multiplayer audience, instant gratification will net them much more success. 
---
But this was a long post just to say all of us here on reddit mean Jack shit to blizz compared to the larger audience they cam draw in.
---
Salvation will fix it
---
Sorry for Horde tho
---
this is so unfair to hard working and dedicated people at blizzard.
---
Just a tip since I see you're using dots, \ removes reddit formatting
---
1. Its as time consuming as you want it to be. But dont expect to much from to little time.
---
2. Its not really a solo game once you reach higher levels. If you want better gear. You need to do some dungeons with others.
---
3. Raids as PvE raids are like mega dungeons with 40 man. There is where you get the best stuff. Most guilds raid 2 or 3 nights a week, 3 hours each raid.
---
4. You can also join PuGs ( Pick uo groups ) groups formed on the spot to do a raid on a saturday for example.
---
5. Fire mages are fun, if you like the fantacy go for it. But once you reached max level and wants to do some raiding. Respeccing to frost mage is more optional but not a must in the easier raids.
---
I didnt play vanilla for ages but its gonna be warrior probably
---
You need to team up for many quests anyway since people are tagging them otherwise.
---
Sure, he very may well stop reading when he sees those two words—I have no way to tell what his true reaction is. Does that choice make him come off like a vapid moron?...I suppose that’s what says so much about him.
---
Maybe as a caster its even easier since with addons you can set your castbar to take lag in to account so you can press the next spell before the first one finishes and it will register and do it right after.
---
thats a good point! they are cerebral, imaginative, thoughtful games.
---
No, they always seemed harder to kill.
---
You can't use the stress test as a basis for what classic will be like. They streamlined a lot of stuff and buffed rates of other things since the stress test is so short
---
Cap was 10 no? And should have been level 5 or 6 leaving?
---
Can't really say with certainty. I guess I'll be trying to relive the "glory days", like many others. Just going to try and have as much fun as I can. Being married now will also limit my play time, so lets see where I can end up with. Wife actually agreed to give Classic a go (although she never played any MMOs). So that's my secret plan to having more play time.
---
But eventually get into casual raiding. Loved the sense of achievement there with my old guild. It could of course turn out to be totally different from what I remember. So will have to see once I get into it.
---
The fact that low server populations and correct mechanics makes it unfeasible. It works on private servers due to the high population and the shitloads of bugs, eg being able to sheep tagged targets etc.
---
The things bad guys want are bad.
---
Makes sense, i forgot everything ... its been so long..
---
Higher chance to hit will not prevent you getting parried more often, it only reduces misses. To reduce effective parry chance of your target, you need weapon skill which you couldn't really gear for as there were very few pieces with it until it was changed into expertise in WotLK.
---
Don’t play Ally unless you’re on a Soy based diet
---
I started after midnight on day 1 of WoW. Had played religiously for 10 years. And had all expansions (up to bfa), but lost interest after LK. Because it started funneling classes down the same ultimate path. Was dull. So I'm looking forward to a bit of nostalgia from classic. I doubt I'll ever be as hardcore as I was then, but it'll be fun to switch.
---
The very next sentence says "This results in an average of .24 extra swings per parry; thus parry favors slower, higher damage weapons."
---
You state it yourself.
---
The problem was that leveling was a chore. Instead of leveling being a rewarding experience (like in classic and tbc) and an adventure in itself it was boring. Instead of releasing heirlooms they should fix leveling being a chore.
---
Heirlooms and Transmog just completely ruin the rpg experience since everyone looks awesome.
---
Back in TBC you could immediatly differentiate between fresh lvl 70 chars who all have the weapons from the ogre arena quest in Nagrand and people who were lvl 70 for a long time. You could see character progression at a glance.
---
How often is that gonna happen, though?
---
that's actually a great reply... i hope so, thank you
---
It is.
---
For hunters : raptor strike reset auto shot timer. Horrible bug
---
Hm, that's not too bad. TThanks!
---
As with all celebrities, streamer-level or international movie star level, they’ll have their fans and haters.  I think he’s doing pretty well for himself, and his streams and YT videos let me see stuff when not gaming that I may never see or do when I game.
---
I imagine they have error logging and stuff but when someone says "did something weird" I assume it's a logic problem in the code and not a hard error which is really hard to create logging around without having constant gigantic log files.
---
I'm sure their logging toggle is extremely verbose in what it writes to logs.
---
Yes
---
Do you guys remember quivers?
---
without a dedicated healer they lose to nothing ?
---
I can't make up my mind. I mostly played a mage in vanilla, so I might go with that again--but warlock or pally also sounds good.
---
Thats how much farming you need to do for feral dps. For feral tank you need maybe 4-5 if you're tanking all the fights in MC, since you only need 1 charge to guarantee a threat lead unless you have multiple rank 14 warriors in your guild. And of course you need less if you're not tanking all the fights in MC. So that is 2.5 hours of farming, but since you can hit the 5 per hour lockout in under half an hour then log to an alt to do something productive, its much less than that.
---
What does the tank’s parry chance have fuck all to do with the boss parrying YOUR attacks? 
---
Prot warriors have always had the benefit of parry over bears, that blue post does nothing to change that fact.
---
Funny part is there is a Zulian Tiger mount from ZG that has orange and white coloring like a real tiger :D
---
Watch out for the layering white knights to mass downvote you for wanting the game to be good.
---
Watching streamers is the gaming equivalent of having a cuckold fetish.
---
I still bet ashbringer never got discovered! I refuse to believe it‘s not in the game 😂
---
I had this happen between ironforge and thelsamar. I appeared back online on top of the mountain between the two zones. 
---
It appears they had some problems with zoning. I kept getting an error saying “instance not available” or something and I wouldnt be able to use abilities or do anything. I reported multiple bug reports with as many details as I could every time it happened to me. I think it’s a layering issue.
---
There's usually a megathread about it even (currently replaced by stress test #2 thread). This should be the latest:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btk0j2/looking\_for\_group\_monday\_may\_27\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btk0j2/looking_for_group_monday_may_27_2019/) 
---
Maybe you'll find something interesting there.
---
PS! It's for all regions.
---
You’re not the one missing something.
---
I never considered shaman, and all threads make it sound pretty meh (not too wanted in PvE, not top heal but not top dps either, too many things to do for too little payoff etc.). They have said they'll remove the totem stomp macros which might make shaman stronger in Classic than it was on a vanilla tho. So maybe I should look into it more.
---
Any cool guides or articles on shamans?
---
It seems like that'd be easy to abuse. Clear a zone of resources, log out, switch to emptier layer, repeat. I don't have a solution though other than don't have layering at all.
---
"There's nothing about gold that makes WoW imbalanced", this is just a demobstrably false statement.
---
Your claim that economic arguments can't offer useful pathways for solving the game's underlying problems is without merit and contradicts your own original intervention.
---
Writing a ton is what I do for fun but sorry if it was boring for you. I don't think we are going to get along all that well :)
---
even in LoD people did a lot of baal runs and mephisto runs for loot or exp. outside of that it was pvp, but i think most people just did loot runs, right? so with diablo 3 they took that idea and made it more interesting. it shouldve worked fine but they missed a lot of things that made diablo 2 a cool program to just be in.
---
This and elite damage lower than pservers can just lead to longer fights, more room for fails and less room to black sheeps (trigger happy dpsers, memespecs and retlols, firehungry Donalds etc)
---
Dwarfs have a certain Charme, I can't denie that.
---
1M is an example. but my points was, and i am repeating kz it did not get through as i wished it, its not about how many they get for classic, but how many they lost after 2-3 years, that will affect if they do tbc classic servers, new vanilla content, seasonal servers, etc.
---
Wh are people so obsessed with looking awesome from the beginning i dont get it. Maybe its the new generation but it feld really rewarding to not just upgrade your stats, but also your looks. Your strength was somehow correlated to your look and easily recognizable.
---
Oh shit he has "XY" bow from "Z" was something you would immediatly notice and use this info.
---
Enjoying weather in summer, collecting some overtime at work and then when summer is almost over, I’m gonna go ahead  with time off and classic wow. Couldn’t be better
---
haha thanks for taking me back lol
---
Look im not trying to be THAT guy... Its just that the main reason behind the terrorists plans was to go down in history and we dont have to encourage the jokes about it. 
---
Its just sad how you guys stretch your arm so far just to grab THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT IN THE TREE. Which also was not even funny..
---
Pretty sure native crit is around 5%
---
The quiver looks awesome
---
If there are empty layers while layering exists then that's an entirely different issue.
---
And if abusing is a priority - layer lock us, when we join a layer we can't join a new one for 12 hours, or an hour.
---
It's not like they don't have the technology, they are just dragging their feet.
---
He is very toxic, but I still watch him.
---
I literally got geared for the first raid and before it even opened just felt this tsunami of boredom and revulsion and uninstalled. Haven't been back.
---
Only the people who used erroneous and unverified data to base their guides on.
---
Okay, that's strange. On the beta servers it worked as intended, maybe it had smth to do with the high loads on the stress realm. I guess it was report-worthy after all! :-D
---
You're not classic
---
For the SAME exact reason why bosses gain 40% timer reduction after a parry.
---
An example :
---
Boss swing timer : 2 seconds. Fight duration : 120 seconds (2 minutes). Boss parry chance : 14%. Warrior Parry chance : 20%.
---
During 120 seconds, the boss will hit the Warrior 60 times (if not parry are involved) and if the boss parries exactly 14% during those 2 minutes, he will hit the Warrior 68-69 times.
---
The Warrior will parry 20% of 60 boss hits (if the boss doesn't parry at all), which means the Warrior will parry 12 hits from the boss in 2 minutes, gaining 40% timer reduction for 12 hits.
---
In the same 2 minutes, if the boss lands 68-69 hits, the Warrior will parry 13-14 hits, gaining 40% timer reduction for 13-14 hits.
---
Since we are talking of the same fight duration, the Warrior will gain additional threat from an extra 1 or 2 hits.
---
Now, this is a simple example, because the RNG applies to EACH HIT, not to the total, which can mean that the boss can parry many more hits, in turn hitting the Warrior more often.
---
Also, the same RNG applies to the Warrior. He can also parry the boss more often.
---
But a median value is clear : if the boss parries 14%, he lands 14% more hits on the Warrior, but the Warrior also parries more hits, in turn generating more threat.
---
Is it clear now?
---
That just looks like an owl flapping its wings on a low fps capture to me. Anyway, I don't see how you could splice that AND the sentinel on the nightsaber without careful individual editing of each frame.
---
Stacking dps warriors, rogues and mages was the meta in vanilla because they were the top 3 dps classes.
---
Asmongold said that he couldn't wait for people to carry him through dungeons.
---
So I just hit level 10 but I'm noticing I'm still getting xp. Spoke to a few people in my guild and they've stopped getting any xp. Though a couple of people said that for people with the beta it goes up to level 19. I haven't got an invite for the beta so I got no idea whats going on.
---
Stress test level cap is 5.  Quite possible some quests will have been done at cap.
---
They literally said that they will be moving people between layers in order to test it.
---
turned out to be my night mode red screen filter. Looked exactly like legendary orange =\
---
Yeah but Cdew is certified trash at things other than running in ghost wolf
---
I didn't know Alex Jones was posting here.
---
everyone, no matter how poor, has a phone and a lil time to kill, and a few bucks to blow now and then. gaming desktops are maybe becoming more niche. dang. youre right. pc gaming is probably a dying thing. i think its kinda proof that there are dedicated wow nerds at blizz tho, that they are still delivering high quality content for wow. hate on bfa is rampant for some reason, but its still a solid world with stuff to do everywhere you go, with secrets and details and updates. i mean its a ton of work to make.
---
&gt;You can't eliminate that 1.1% dodge chance.
---
Ok, but you can get 1% crit instead of the hit. So it kinda evens out.
---
have you killed mobs and gained exp? or did u at 9 and 99% exp turn in a quest and think ur still gaining exp.
---
Was your last source of XP a quest turn in? If so, it might just be the XP spilling over. Or are you still getting XP from killing mobs?
---
He might seem that way you're right, I think it's the persona he puts on, which a few people mentioned here.
---
People watch streamers because of their personality or the persona they create and that's true for many streamers. I think he creates a good balance between a raging, toxic baby and very real, honest and helpful streamer which makes him so appealing.
---
You shut your dirty mouth. The release date was like a blessing from above, like manna from the sky :p
---
For testing purposes, see if you can ding to 11 then.
---
You get gold for quests after level cap as if you were level 60, from what I've heard.
---
Tauren are mostly good guys.
---
Orcs and Trolls are more neutral, Orcs are honorable but warlike, Trolls have some shady voodoo magic stuff.
---
Undead, well... you have a whole zone-wide questchain centered around terrorizing civilians, genocide and chemical weapons.
---
No idea. I'll go and check
---
Wow, what level were you? I am level 6 and just leaving and have 4 silver to my name...
---
Your names are fine for RP realms. Remember, fantasy worlds often have surnames that are earned titles based on deed. A two word descriptor would be fitting. A strong character might be known by a name such as Ironfist or Willbreaker. I like to come up with something fitting for the race. Dwarves are all something involving a forge for me. Tauren are always an anagram of Tauren/Nature. Orcs tend to get sound effects for hitting something. Thunk, or Thwomp. Things like that. Keeps it funny for me.
---
As long as your name isn’t something like Illpwnunubz you will be fine. The worst they do is flag you for rename and only escalate punishment if you continue to insist on an equally unacceptable name.
---
Another thing to remember is if you roll on an RP realm you will be writing a story with those you play with. Some players are very serious about the RP, and may know you by a different name than what floats over your head. You can very readily create a character using a surname, and introduce yourself in character by your given name instead. For example, my name. I make a character named Crestrider but I game I might introduce myself as Zanar. The RPers would understand the distinction and the non-RPers would simply call me by whatever lazy shortening they decided on of Crestrider.
---
&gt; We're talking about boss parry chance, not the tank's parry chance. 
---
So you are disregarding that Warrior tanks will generate more threat than Druid tanks in Classic, because they will get hit more often, and will parry more often, generate more threat?
---
Yeah, anything that suits your deluded opinion that Druids will actually tank raid bosses in Classic.
---
Imagine how annoying barrens/general/trade chat will be.. just like Asmon’s chat, just pog pog gachibullshit all day.  This would completely ruin the experience for me. 
---
I enjoyed my chuck norris jokes and random general chat from players that were not butt tapping Asmon.
---
New computer time!
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Devilaur mafia wont happen on live. Its considered manipulation of econemy and that was even back in the days very bannable .
---
From WoWWiki. It is wrong sometimes, but I highly doubt it's wrong on such a simple thing.
---
Terrible itemization. Who wants +Duelling and Ninja Looting. I'd rather have like +50 Farming.
---
Do remember that changing specs is SERIOUSLY expensive in Classic. You can't hop between two specs constantly.
---
https://bigjpg.com/
---
How selfish of them especially since they both said they would announce it before launch. Not everyone idolizes streamers. I want to be as far as I can from them.
---
I thought everyone had 5% naturally?
---
Yes, but OP asked about Deadmines in particular, this Patch Notes does not mention low lvl dungeons.
---
Pretty cool to be able to ride your pet though x)
---
i would 'change realm' and check the list if I were you
---
They don't send out emails if you get into the Beta!
---
&gt;Basically, Prot Warriors will ditch out more threat than Druids...because Warriors can parry also, and benefit from parry-haste mechanics.
---
I dont think you have looked at the math here. A Prot Warrior is nowhere close to a Druid's threat. Druids are threat tanks used for encounters where absolute mitigation is not necessary. They should be compared to a dualwield Furyprot instead.
---
Balance. Do it like a man.
---
Kinx my man, Arantir here - long time no see :)
---
You can crit at level 1, you have native crit chance.
---
Okay yes it's clear but with 14% boss parry and like 20% parry on warrior it's a 2.8% chance with each of your attacks that you gain parry haste from it. Considering it gives you a 40% reduction on your swing timer in the best case, you'll gain 1.12% more attacks from that fact.
---
Now comparing to private servers where the chance is like 5.6% ( rounds to 0.45% more attacks), the difference in additional attacks from the tanks perspective is around 0.67% more attacks over a boss fight, which seems negligible for tps.
---
I don't think such a small difference will make or break druid tanks in classic compared to pservers.
---
cap is 30 ?
---
Stress test server my friend
---
Imagine my shock
---
&gt;It's basically a 4% hit chance increase for a +5 weapon skill.
---
Lol no. This would mean Human and Orc would only need 4% hit to get capped. Which is obviously not the case.
---
It's 0.04% per weapon skill.
---
... the XP in groups is better with more people? eh?
---
Are you referring to your FOV setting?
---
I will devote 95% of my time for classic
---
&gt; Look im not trying to be THAT guy...
---
well then stop
---
That's why you decide realms into battlegroups with shared name db. You rather divide realms into Mini realms and run the risk of not seeing your friends and people you run into even if you picked the same realm?
---
But mages get free 30% threat reduction, and rogues can feint and vanish, so they care much less about a loss of tank threat. DPS warriors are hard capped by the tank's threat, so if tank threat goes down their DPS goes down and so too does the advantage of stacking them.
---
So we may see vanilla-level stacking rather than pirate server raids you hear about with 14 warriors or whatever.
---
RIP Vern Troyer. He was my favorite wow commercial
---
Ehh, how people have forgotten about stuff like Wowhead. Was a lifesaver back then ...
---
I believe that it was removed in Cataclysm, so it was quite a long ago, when all we were just "professional noobs" :)
---
Hardcore people should just stick to Retail.
---
They’re actually insanely mana efficient. You just downrank flash of light and use a bunch of + healing gear.
---
Healing is only good if you have classes that do damage which in classic basically means warriors.
---
I was wondering if this is to do with resolution and not my worst fear come true that is the 7.3 client has down scaled the world in regards to trees etc?
---
I think one game found a solution to this problem, it's gonna be Torchlight Frontiers. In order to get more power you will progress your character only in one specific dungeon. Let's say you raid Onyxia with starter gear, you then upgrade this gear until it's perfect. This perfect gear will only be as good as it is when you are in Onyxias raid, if you do Molten Core then you start anew. Basically you progress your gear individually in each dungeon/raid and become better at it and thus you have no power creep and can add new content ad infinitum and keeping all content relevant. Let's hope other games will copy that design, it's genius.
---
No, it was just a profoundly stupid comment. How the fuck would you make a "streamer free" server? Should Blizzard carefully monitor and ban players if they're found to be streamers? If someone plays there for a while and begins streaming, and becomes popular, should he be banished from the server? You're the retard here.
---
I think the big ones will impact servers. The streamers want to make money so they will do things to get viewership like gather huge groups of people to do certain things. Also remember, they will likely dominate local chat, so if you are posting LFG, it will likely not be seen. I am going to avoid servers with the big streamers.
---
And he swallowed his pride, admited he was wrong and announced classic on blizzcon. But hey! Lets blind hate the guy because you can't comprehend people can change :)
---
Ah sorry thought it was the beta, I didnt know abut stress test
---
Don’t worry, she’s still kicking.
---
So does this mean we can assume the dps differences between classes will be smaller, because warlocks already struggle with threat, and will do even more now, and warriors/rogues can't simply go as bananas due to threat either, or no?
---
Sometimes in life you have to stand up for yourself no matter if it means you need to make other people uncomfortable. Im sorry you feel uncomfortable in this situation... Because if you were not, why would you leave a shit pointless comment like that?
---
They are saying that the developer should log every error regardless and take away the "would you like to send logs" button
---
The solution they have now seems like it's both much better and easier than what you are suggesting really.
---
While playing you will not just swap layers here and there. Your layer will be static until you group up and / or join a guild. In that case the new layer will be your home.
---
After a while the majority of your friends will be on the same layer as well, so you won't even switch when grouping with them.
---
Yep, I did my darnest to push Classic away to avoid having to spend a monthly fee on two MMOs and because I don't trust Blizzard. Well, let's just say curiosity got the best of me and the more attention I payed to Classic, the more it drew me in. Now I am switching MMOs and thus going into Classic in full force.
---
God bless.
---
You’re Abe Froman? The—Sausage King of Chicago?
---
I recommend Diablo 3. Started playing it with a friend of to unironically getting used to grinding. Turns out the game is great!
---
Lmao why would most people not have work over summer? Most people aren't teachers
---
Log levels my dude
---
TV celebrities didn't exist in classic, they do now and it's their fans that are the problem.  If they stayed logged out and just watched his stream it would be fine.  But it's an ingame circle jerk which impacts gameplay.
---
Pretty sure this was posted like a week ago.
---
Sigh.. Most bullshit misinformation from clueless idiots.
---
Druids have a 2.5 sec attackspeed.
---
Meanwhile Warrior tanks need to dualwield to produce the same kind of threat.
---
Which tank do you think will be most affected by higher boss parry?
---
is this the part where I cry about a joke and pretend I have the moral high ground?
---
Funny how describing two video game towns shows the colors of people. haha
---
It's funny that people always talk streamers in plural, but in reailty most of the time they are talking about Asmongold. Is there any other stream with a big cult following him everywhere?
---
Good thing i am on eu and won't have to worry about those huge strimezzz
---
Did you somehow forgot to add the DECREASE on Druid's threat because he will get parried more often?
---
Warrior threat will go up 2-3%, while Druid's threat will go down more than 10%.
---
Overall, Warriors will generate 12-13% more threat in Classic than Druids on private servers.
---
Really, try looking at the big picture. You only assumed the threat gained by Warriors, but forgot the threat loss by Druids.
---
And if you throw in the damage spikes of that 250% increased chance to parry in Classic vs private servers...Druids become basically unwanted in raids for main tanking. They will be very hard to heal, because they can get a damn unlucky string of 3 parries in row, being hit 3 times in less than 5 seconds...and 2 of those hits to be crits. It WILL happen much more often than you think...because it happened in Vanilla so many times.
---
It was really sad to see Bears given the opportunity to tank some MC bosses, and being insta-gibbed. It will be the same in Classic.
---
Off tanking thrash? Sure. But main tanking bosses? Nope.
---
Idk there's lots of contention into what weapon skill translates to.
---
I doubt it. They specifically emphasized the importance of not having layering when world bosses are live and how only 1 world boss should spawn per server.
---
"We tested attacking creatures at -5, +0, +1, +2, +3, +5, and +15 levels relative to our level (so for the level 15 test, we attacked level 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 35"
---
Oops, goofed of the numbers there a bit
---
&gt;After a while the majority of your friends will be on the same layer as well
---
Magically.
---
And I guess you just refused to watch OPs 3 clips.
---
Better and easier for blizzard is to allow layering the way it is.
---
It can't be perfect but it can be improved by launch.
---
And then there's this. The Warrior is miles ahead of everyone on the meters despite cluelessly sitting in Battle Stance for half the fight.
---

Its not unreasonable to think that out of 60K viewers 400 got an invite to the stress test?
---
works slows down
---
summer vacations, kids vacations
---
there is a reason why blizzard and other companies never release games in the summer
---
Someone doesnt understand how Patchwerk works :)
---
On a similar note, am I the only one who has a hard time coming up with fitting names for night elves? I don't have any issues with naming characters of other races, but I just can't get the root for NE names to create one that fits. Gaelic? Nordic? On one hand we have Broll, but on the other we have Illidan. I just can't put my finger on it.
---
your thunderfury can't save you now
---
I think it’s extremely important that you can identify what someone is wearing by sight, and that the appearance of good gear was, in itself, a reward.
---
BGs are the honor system won't be out while we're initially leveling.  Where do you intend on PvPing?
---
Yes and the system makes the error without knowing it is an error. That‘s why it makes the error in the first place.
---
Anyone else used to get exciting flying over that dragon back in the day?
---
Polish, hooray! I love Joanna Jedrzejczyk :)
---
In retail if you hit it at all before it dies you get full loot/credit.
---
Yes, but a program doesn't know what is a bug and isn't, so it would be a continuous stream of logs, which it already is running, but with the added burden of the developer having to find the specific point in time where it happened.
---
Why are people so quick with saying that it's going to be harder now? What if the damage is much lower? It won't matter that the boss is parrying more often if hes doing 20% less damage than on private servers.
---
You know this how?
---
3% of a month is less than a full day. (21.9h)
---
!remindme 88 days
---
Oh wow, another pointless post from the random person. How unexpected.
---
Why do you need to cry?
---
Crazy things like this didn't happen often, but they did happen and were part of what made the game so special.
---
You probably continued your level 5 character from last week.
---
Sharddown to Layering, my favourite podcast about sharding and layering and how they suck and will destroy wow and also the world.
---
remindme! 88 days
---
That was indeed removed in Cata - but, effectively, in 3.2 (only very few bosses in ToC/ICC did parryhaste).
---
Heirlooms are way worse than scaling. 
---
I actually don’t mind it at max level, it is more interesting to have things chase and agro me and have to plan my path, then just blindly run through camps of grey mobs. 
---
If leveling still took 200 hours, I wouldn’t care about scaling, I’d choose my own adventure zone by zone to 120. Do I want scaling in classic? Absolutely not. Would I want it added in a classic + absolutely not. 
---
But given where retail is at, I think scaling is a pretty decent system.
---
There is nothing redeeming about looms except to people who don’t like playing MMORPGs in the first place.
---
Good. Gank em till they stop streaming

Mail is instant now. But, uh, take your gold tokens and go home mate - that shit is economic cancer.

The healers might die from heart attacks themselves.

Ye no one knows the specific list of bosses, but I think most of them did parryhaste.
---
Looks like a bug. This ability is not supposed to scale. Good find.
---
RemindMe! 88 days
---
Not sure why people are downvoting for an opinion that is on-topic, but yes, I think he is generally a good guy
---
Yeah because in 2004 they didn’t have this problem?
---
Make more fucking servers. This nonsense about *needing* layering is just wrong.
---
Make more servers, plan which will possibly merge if needed, earmark names, and suddenly you don’t need layering *at all*
---
This has zero impact on any dps balance. Bosses do not parry from behind, and if you're hitting the boss regularly from the front, you deserve to be kicked from the raid.
---
Parry haste bursting tanks was a regular issue back in vanilla with bosses that have mechanics that cause the dps or the boss to move in a way where the melee accidentally end up hitting their front instead of back.
---
No, not really.  The total exp gained is higher, but its split by all group members.  So it’s still lower on an individual basis.
---
And the black knights
---
I appreciate the advice - I might go warrior. I feel like classic is very much about utilizing 100% of your class so not wanting to utilize the healing of a druid would be a waste
---
I was Horde back in Vanilla so I agree, playing Alliance could create an almost new game feeling. And I like the idea of going mage for soloing, lots of utility, free food and water, and you can travel around quickly with portals. And they are pretty good at world pvp which is always a plus while leveling.
---
Posting about a group declination. Incredible.
---
They did fucking WHAT?
---
*chuckles*  
---
I'm in danger
---
I agree
---
If Blizzard can’t provide a proper classic experience we will just go elsewhere
---
Plus, at least we will know official damage values now too.
---
They had to invent a new form of math to recreate Vanilla. They really are going above and beyond to bring us this game.
---
As a guild/raid leaderits expected for you to never miss a raid. Especially if your a MT pr important healer. That's seems like the biggest downside imo and probably why I've always avoided it.
---
What can you do?
---
Just play the game and stop worrying about it.
---
What?
---
The five minutes on it was a bit much?
---
And idiots letting him loot arena trinket
---
This guy alts
---
Dots don't cause pushback
---
Two different perspectives, one could be from a human FPP, and one could be a gnome FPP. If you draw horizon lines it'll become very obvious to you. There are different shaders at work which can give a different feel of depth - but the models are the exact same. I'd say the world feels bigger than private servers in my opinion. But I know its the same unit for unit.
---
Happy for the profit. You still have literally no leg to stand on and didn't say anything to any of my points. People who don't want some kind of layering/shard system on launch are basically asking for a boat with no paddles.
---
is the wow killer going to be wow itself?
---
[I keep making this face when I see layering in action.](https://i.imgur.com/RHf0Ahb.jpg?fb)
---
Blizzard. I don't like it!
---
\&gt;get coffee with  
---
Lol what are you, an extrovert??
---
There are many benefits to running games at much higher FPS than the monitor's refresh rate. The processes are just running faster and every input (especially camera rotation) has lower delay, hiccups are less likely to drop the fps below refresh rate etc.. It's just a better experience and not always a waste of electricity.
---
You can try it yourself in CS:GO or any other action game. For example, Skyrim is a completely different game when you disable Vsync and increase the fps cap to 85 or so. The game suddenly feels responsive and smooth like a PC game and not a Bethesda crap.
---
I agree! That's why I'm all for #nochanges.
---
Its stupid in classic, cause more of the wrong stats is worse then less of a good stat.
---
No it isn't. There weren't druids tanks in vanilla because until late in the game Dire Bear Form didn't exist so at lvl60 you'd still only have a 180% armor bonus.
---
I’m coming up with 32.33. Repeating, of course.
---
If you say increasing raid dps means raid bosses would need to be retuned, the bosses designed for 8 debuffs already should be.
---
"forgiving people" - as if people not being allowed to use their debuffs because they push others off were an intended mechanic, and as if it added anything of value to an rpg game. As if playing your class is something that needs to be "forgiven".
---
And as you said, information is already going to change the playing field, you're never going to have the same experience again. In that regard, changing the mechanics to what they would have liked them to be at the time if not for various limitations, would be closer to the original experience of getting to discover and optimize something new, while still within the world and mindset of vanilla.
---
I was able to continue progression after the wife expansion, but quit at the kids expansion.
---
We used to tank instances with rogues and shammy. What the fuck is this noise about wow vanilla being hard? Surely it's just trolling.
---
A lot of people just knew "Melee attack from behind" without fully appreciating why.  You could have been a fully competent DPS that always complied with that rule without necessarily knowing why you were doing it.
---
You know what breaks immmersion way more? When you're walking through a major city and you see maybe a handful of other people. Or you go out questing for a few hours and see maybe 2 other players in that time. Really feels like a big populated world then.
---
ggwp
---
I got lvl 10 and I had roughly 60s 
---
I spent it on enchanting and made a wand for my priest.
---
Its actually pretty damn good for AoE farming at the appropriate level. Saved my ass a bunch of times while learning.
---
&gt; but I realized it was truly a waste of time which would not progress my character meaningfully.
---
This sums up the whole issue.
---
People dont play games for fun anymore, certainly not wow.
---
People min/max everything, think of numbers and percentages.
---
I remember when it all changed for me in wow, I stopped exploring and having fun and started obsessing over numbers, points, percentages, badges, etc a game within a game

FoV changes due to screen ratio and resolution increases in the past decade and a half.
---
The new engine made this correction a while back to correct the perspective and FoV for newer screens.
---
It's less of a change than it is a correction.
---
Hi, /u/Blazerified
---
There are still a few rare mounts in the world, and we can still get mounts from friendly factions if we grind the rep.
---
Yeah many people decide to downvote instead of having a conversation it seems...
---
We have no idea
---
The jug's seem the same size yet the tree trunk base is much wider? can that really be from gnome vs dwarf?
---
never knowing basic mechanics of dodge parry miss glancing  
---
no
---
That’s fair enough, you can disagree.
---
Bring out the tinfoil hat.
---
Sorry, i'm just kidding around. It seemed like everytime I listened to an episode it happened to feature  someone complaining about sharding that's all.
---
Continued devil's advocate:
---
Were those semi automations possible in vanilla? Were they part of the experience?
---
Then why is this change okay, but other sensible ones not?
---
This is not a bug or an issue. They stated via server broadcasts in game they'd be actively layering people in and out. They were intentionally testing functionality.
---
It's already been stated drop rates in PServers are higher than they were in Vanilla.
---
Needing more mobs means more spare change and junk to sell.
---
The real gold grind doesn't start until later in the game. Don't worry. It will hit.
---
Just because it's not mentioned, this is a buff for Paladin tank threat as well. More attacks from parry haste = more reflect from BOS and Holy Shield.
---
Added so much to the RPG aspect as well. This highly dangerous hideout or whatever, isn't just going to be wide open to the whole world. You first have to track down a key. Love it.
---
Private servers are harder by the seems of it. Just look at the elite damage difference
---
&gt; getting a high weapon skill won't make your glancing reduction 0% 
---
Does this mean weapon skill is less valuable?
---
is there a way to revert back to the wider resolution/ fov using the modern client?
---
Whats different in this case? I heard alliance warlocks are better off with the change than horde too. Sorry still noob lol.
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
You would be better off asking in the /r/wowservers subreddit
---
They haven't as many folks are complaining about just this very thing that makes it harder to test - especially gold at 30.
---
Less damage in general if dpsing behind, but only by a little. For sure less dps when standing in front. Standing in front is especially bad now because a parry by a mob increases the speed of their next auto, meaning a dpser's attack getting parried can lead to unexpected burst damage on the tank. And yeah, makes generating threat harder as prot.
---
Some points - remember the current client is based off like a Legion client or whatever. Many of console variables are also applicable to live. 
---
However, there are a couple of values incorrect in this post. 
---
    /run SetCVar("cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor", 2.5)
---
The max value for this is actually 4 right now in classic. On live it's supposed to be 2.6, and I was originally going to post as much. However, after just entering values and then dumping the cvar value back into chat, 4 is the highest that I've been able to get to stick. 
---
Test it yourself - zoom out to max, set it higher than 2.5, you'll be able to zoom further. 
---
[Screenshot proof](https://i.imgur.com/b9gJGDP.png) (see chat and obviously also how far I'm zoomed out)
---
Secondly
---
    /run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 80)
---
The max value for this is 100 - this is the same as it is on live. [Screenshot proof](https://imgur.com/a/ErT1N4L) of higher value.
---
As for target cast bars - if you dump the total list of console commands using C_Console.GetAllCommands() (or use AdvancedInterfaceOptions) you can see that there are still many console commands in the game that are left over from the live client, but do not function.
---
For example, there are console variables for the personal resource display (as in the player only health/mana nameplate on live), but obviously they do not function.
---
----
---
As a separate point, I would like to point out some of the CVars I find interesting myself. 
---
There are the [findYourself](https://i.imgur.com/B0Mlkib.png) CVars. These are the CVars on live that add a highlight around your character or a selection circle under you.
---
[nameplateMinAlpha](https://i.imgur.com/CLTfyPG.png) to 0 will (assuming nameplateMinAlphaDistance, nameplateMaxAlpha, and nameplateMaxAlphaDistance are not changed) will fade out nameplates too, so that units further away have lower transparency. Obviously you can set the distance with the two distance CVars of this fading or inverse it by leaving MinAlpha at 1 and changing MaxAlpha to 0. 
---
You can set nameplateOccludedAlphaMult from 1 to something like 0.5 if you want to fade out units that are behind walls and other things, or nameplateNotSelectedAlpha between 0 and 1 also to make nameplates for units other than your target fade out too.
---
Hi, /u/Tkdude81
---
Good. I've always been uncomfortable with how strong melee dps was on pservers.
---
All that matters is which version of myself wakes up August 26th lol
---
Yep, back in the day you would just dismiss pet then call them once you were back on your feet.
---
Thats deep.
---
Yes you could auto heal with one button macro for quite a very long time. Might have been changed in Naxx I can't remember.
---
My body is ready
---
No idea tbh
---
Fury prot will happen. It's just a question if it's as viable as it is on pservers
---
&gt;Also I use the mouse buttons held down to run, what do you guys use in terms of keys and movement etc?
---
I bind strafe to A/D, hold right mouse button and move like it's an FPS.
---
q,e,r,f,z,x,c,v,t,g,b,\ main action bar  
---
Ctrl + the above for bottom left bar  
---
1-6,1-6+ctrl for bottom right bar  
---
F keys, 2 thumb buttons and ctrl for right bars.
---
This gives me 40 quick keybinds, plus f keys for slower stuff like food, etc. I never saw the need for an MMO mouse personally, but at the same time, I don't have any real experience with them, so I can't say they're bad or anything.
---
None?
---
What about the massive raids that were organized by streamers on beta to explore the Kara Crypts and kite world bosses to cities? Stuff like that is fun and it probably would have never happened without the streamers organizing all these people. 
---
What about streamers that will be around for the long haul and keeping the population on their servers high and healthy throughout all of the phases of Classic?
---
There are both positives and negatives of streamers on your server.
---
The worst part about their gear sale is that they're advertising it as Summer ware and they're selling jackets, hoodies, and sweatshirts. Just dumping their winter gear without even giving a discount.
---
I enjoy diablo 3 but when they made all the gear bop I felt like there was no reason to play the game anymore. 
---
The thing that made diablo 2 so much fun was the fact that you could spend hours farming in the Hope's of finding an item that you could trade later for other gear. Diablo 3 is lacking this.
---
C'thun belt is better than Bonescythe
---
I misread your comment, yeah you're right - edited my post
---
I missed the broadcasts at the start, my bad - updated post
---
I'm not on the discord but I'd say that's your best bet to find a group if you want one when server details are released.
---
And how do the API changes fit into all of that?  
---
After that: how does that reasoning (whatever the answer is) extend to things like the debuff limit?
---
I have just read that  parry did not speed up your attack timer until TBC. It just gave you a delayed instant attack within the next second. 
---
 *There was some controversy over why there was a lag after the parry and the next attack. One conclusion to be arrived at is that the second attack is in fact supposed to be instant, however due to client to server lag there is normally a 0.5 to 1.5 second delay before the next attack.* 
---

---
Even in beta dmg from seal of righteousness is applied after some time, so it could be true for 2005-2006 servers.
---
well
---
until AQ and naxx
---
Players can kill you with 2 buttons, specially casters, the game ends there
---
By the very word ‘disgusting’ you mean that the condition of his room disgusts YOU.
---
Meaning it’s not fact, it’s opinion.
---
I'm not even in the #nochanges corner for everything I just want to know why I immediately felt a difference in the size of the world on beta
---
No no, it’s all good! I’m fine with it being pointed out. I know there’s a huge camp of ‘stop worrying/caring, it’s necessary and very temporary’, but I feel like it is still something we’re learning about and figuring out more as the beta goes on, the show will likely touch on it even further in the future, but I’ll try to get more opinions on from people who are really positive about it, and I’m definitely not looking to devote hours to it. I’m far from ‘the sky is falling’ about it but I’m not quite in love with it either. It’s a bit of a divisive one!
---
Some of them feel like they have an obligation to their viewers to enjoy the game with them.
---
Well done with the fresh meme
---
Because it's easier to backwards engineer the modern client that is already modernized enough to have bnet integration, heightened security and other similar services, rather than include them into the archaic old systems.
---
This mostly checks out, but I don't actually think fury warriors actually tank with dual wield. I'm pretty sure they often just throw on a shield.
---
my bad, indeed it was just for lvl60 instances in patch note.
---
So I don't know! I never tried to enter low level instances in vanilla so I have no clue about it. (I'd argue that it's quite pointless but that's not answering the question)
---
rogues can go full banana cuz vanish and threadmeters?
---
This is one of the top reasons I'm looking forward to Classic. I really dislike all the irrelevant content in current WoW, it really takes you out of the experience.
---
Blast Wave :D
---
Probably more appetite for a no streaming server.
---
Modern raids rely on strategy and solid players. The past few expansions almost every boss has had a mechanic where a single player can instawipe the raid frequently.
---
And random dps needing to do special roles to make a fight possible.
---
Aren't dodges an issue for furies as well? Mobs can dodge from behind, right?
---
Also, what's the source of the cap at 5% glancing reduction?
---
That shirt has more debuffs than buffs.
---
Hmm, good point.
---
Oh joy.
---
Im banned on there.
---
1% of zero is still zero
---
So I won't get to make add-ons I would have been able to make in vanilla.
---
Which means it's far from an authentic recreation of it?
---
Absolutely. I forgot how completely defenseless low levels were until recently. Even getting to level 5 is a significant increase in power.
---
Your opinion is what's invalid. It's perfectly reasonable that they opt to keep one thing but get rid of another.   
---
The world is not black and white, it's not all or nothing.
---
Go raid Hogger
---
I meant no offense, just memes =)
---
Arantir &lt;3 Will you be playing Classic?
---
A game like d2 could exist , sure, but then they'd also be selling +exp , +mf, and +rune word modifiers on their store with a bunch of gaudy shit.  After sc2 flopping and hearth stone printing money, it will never be the same.
---
It’s terrible. I think it’s half the reason I hated BFA.
---
OH NO, NOT SMALLER TREES!
---
jesus christ get real kid
---
Turns out I was wrong and missed the broadcasts at the start, it seems to be exactly what they had in mind for this stress test
---
Yeah dps warriors will still be very, very strong. They scale the hardest in the game with gear. They honestly needed to be taken down a peg or two. The former WoW dev who designed the classes for vanilla said that if there was going to be another patch, they would have nerfed warriors. But instead they just held off on a lot of changes they wanted to make until BC.
---
I don't think anybody thinks enhancement shaman is godlike good. It is just good. It's not an optimal spec to play but it's not that bad. And most important it's fun for some people.
---
And even more important, if you want to steamroll in BG get yourself a premade without enhancements and let us plebs that like to play the 20% slot machine enjoy ourselves. Or better yet, roll Alliance and then you get to destroy the very thing you seem to hate some much.
---
Are these the actual icons or are they colorshifted so it looks more like the image you're trying to make?
---
RemindMe! 88 days "console commands classic"
---
Look up FoV WoW.exe fixes, there's a couple floating around. Don't be using these on official stuff though
---
I would say it reduces the chances of being laid by more than 99%
---
That's just ... classic!
---
Why did you even both to type this?  It does nothing to answer my valid question.  There is literally no clean solution to the problem up breaking up an overfilled server when the time comes to do that.  
---
Hopefully your the one guy who gets fucked by this when you get sent to a new realm as the only member of your guild and with every single person your friends list split across 10 different other realms.  Maybe then your little brain will be able to comprehend how its actually a problem that is just solved with an "elective transfer".
---
Is this your first time on this sub? These people are dead serious, it makes it even more hilarious.
---
There's no point playing private servers due to coming official release where all your chars will be much valuable and you know that nothing would happen with all your diligence. As for me the best solution is watching videos, streamers and getting inspiration for putting all your efforts into this kind of creation called characters. Not playing for a long gives you more desire too :)
---
For some reason this makes me imagine the game with realistic graphics. Something about the lighting in this photo is more realistic... Awesome shot!
---
level cap is set to 10 on stress test, so yes, he is level cap.
---
For the beta, yeah.  But stress test doesn't require an invite, you just download it with the Battle.net launcher and go from there.  It's basically the same client for beta and stress test, but you won't see the beta realms if you're not in the beta, and you won't see any realms when a stress test isn't running.
---
Play Mordhau
---
Switching? I'll be subbing for Classic exclusively.
---
Yeah he said he wont be getting #1. Mage grouping and AoEing and also lots of people practicing on private servers the last years wont be beatable as far as i heard.
---
Kind of glad it’s at the end of summer. It lets me close out my social life with nice weather
---
Well, that also means it's easier for feral to get stuck on almost zero threat for longer.
---
I didn't forget it, I just specifically did not want you personally to vote so I left that question out.
---
Exactly what im doing right now! Working overtime to get more money and extra days off for when classic launches!
---
True. But sharding will only be there for the start right? Still sucks if it stays that exploitable. Just means you gotta put lots of time into it while you can.
---
So if with enough weapon skill youd only need to stack 5% hit on a fury war and dump the rest into crit/ap?
---
This seems like a buff, or is this only the case because bosses are going to be parrying/dodging more no matter what?
---
Yeah man regular updates driven by the community... we avg about 100k players online... I'm sure wow will do a lot better...
---
Thank you for this run down.
---
I hope they continue Classic development along the Classic train tracks, possibly including new content... If MC took them a week to make, why not continue on that road?
---
yOu tHInK yOu dO BUt YOu dON't
---
Lulwhat, warrior attacks will get parried more often too.  -10% for both druids and warrs.
---
It wasn’t random. You pressed the small button underneath the scroll wheel which speeds the mouse up. Just press it again and it will change
---
there's a lot of split opinions on these: they were definitely fan-service-y and it felt good to have them, but it was also super empty-feeling and a step away from good item and loot design.
---
That's alright, at least you tried to help :) As for entering low lvl dungeons with more than 5 people, I think it would be interesting! I for one, am planning to level slowly and enjoy the experience, doing every dung etc. I can imagine a situation where I am with buddy and someone is looking for just 1 person for a dung, but this way we could both join and just do it with 6 people :) Also it would be easier to jst find group being dps cause more DPS would jt be able to join groups.
---
Maybe.. This is attack table research witch is only 1 of 3 things that needs testing/confirmation before we can assume what the dps balance will look like. The two other ones are:
---
- raid boss armor values; on pservers these are just low enough that if you stack sunder armor and annihilation you can get their armor close to zero where the effect on dps is huge.
---
- raid boss magic resistance: We don't know these and they effect caster damage a lot.
---
This actually sounds fun
---
Those bastards! Hahaha and yep!
---
It looks like the text is just photoshopped on top of the shirts and on top of the mug, looks to perfectly flat on non-flat surfaces. I would definitely not buy stuff from that site.
---
Hi, /u/omfgMURPHINATOR, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
I remember most groups being around 16-18. The healer could get away with being 15, he had to be carefull pulling aggro from mobs on ledges.
---
No one asks the most important question - why Troll Warrior?
---
Order of the Flaming Ruby sounds better to me. The order of the just sounds jumbled.
---
You already have something pretty similiar if you think about it. 
---
Every two years comes a new expansion which basically wipes all your progress of your character (except for gold and mounts) 
---
Maybe that was OP's point
---
Its just your brain because of the resolution change
---
They've already implemented changes. Pretty much #nochanges and #nochanges are worlds apart.
---
They're trying to make the experience as close to there original as they want (not as close as they can; this is an important distinction). But they never once promised that there would not be changes.
---
Yes,' IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)' is code residue from 2014 from WOD.
---
That is not a mechanic in vanilla, you know why? 
---
Because hunters did not have deadzone in WOD...they have a min and a max range in vanilla...not in Wod..Rogues have no 5-8 kiting bound to getting instantly killed in WOD..Warriors care about charging OOC or intercepting INC...mages are not squishy and instantly killable in WOD...the list goes on.
---
This is vanilla not WOD.
---
All your clips show the fast difference between beta and what the game actually was.
---
It's true, it's the same with Ninja looters, we had em on a list
---
Some of them have a little color shift.
---
New league in Path of Exile next Friday, league ends just around launch of Classic, though I usually only play a league for 1-1½ month. Leaves plenty of time for the summer plans
---
It shouldn't, beyond the first few weeks. Classic launch might turn out to be more successful, in which case life would suck. I'm not sure that Blizzard has an answer for that yet.
---
For the most part it's not going to make a difference.
---
On low end to progression guilds threat isn't going to be an issue. People will just have a wait a few more seconds for the tank to get agro before going ham.
---
On high end guilds where threat is a serious issue it's just going to slow them down a bit.
---
I have a level 55 hunter untouched since 2007. Has carrot still equipped and its going to stay that way. He is my personal time capsule.
---
Ohh damn key collecting, with the keychain. I forgot all about that.. man I'm in for a rude awakening.
---
Whatever you want and what you think is cool/fun
---
It's all about fun!
---
I agree 100% that you don't want to leave an area before you are finished with it because you out leveled that area. But I think there lies the problem. Why are you getting more xp to quickly pass the zone cap before you actually finish it. I am not referring to queuing for a dungeon but if you do just quests you can out level a zone pretty quickly. In classic, you will finish all the quest and still be half a bar of xp away from the next level to even get access to the next zone which has problems in it self but also serves a better purpose of using the entire zone and not 20% of each zone.
---
Sure, but nothing is bound to your account, but to your character. When you see someone with a rare title on a rare mount on retail, you have no idea if that's his main character, or just some alt he's using to farm.
---
If you see someone with specific armor/mounts/pets in Classic, you'll know that they got it on the character that is running around with it.
---
Windfury in the tank group is the answer to that. Don't forget, Horde had world first clears of every raid, except Blackwing lair. In that case, you can point toward the Shaman class call being quite a bit more dangerous than the Paladin.
---
the amount of facepalm in here is off the charts
---
the so called "naming policy" is only there to stop you from putting spaces, numbers, dashes, or basically anything that isn't a letter in your name.
---
as long as you don't trigger their "bad word" list you're free to name your shit whatever you want. how is that not obvious?
---
Yep and they all look great, unlike the mess in retail.
---
I'll be horde on a PvP server, not sure what race/class yet, I'm strongly considering shaman.
---
-spills over xp from a quest
---
-runs to reddit before hitting another mob
---
-debunked before finishing post
---
You have to kite those adds until they go to college
---
No problem, just don't be so quick to panic when you encounter bugs on a testing realm, months before release.
---
I consider that a good amount of saved time. I don’t know why I’m being argued with here. 30 minutes is subjectively valuable to different people. To me, that is a lot of time to save.
---
See you on the other side!
---
Prior to Warcraft 3 the Horde were the bad guys. However Warcraft 3's story sort of redeems them and makes Thrall out to be probably the purest character of all. Prior to that they were mostly peaceful tribes. But the burning legion corrupted them and gave them demon blood. They then invaded Azeroth and lost.   
---
The Tauren are mostly peaceful and probably one of the more noble races.   
---
Most trolls are generally pretty savage and ruthless. The Dark spear tribe were suppose to be like the more noble trolls although they were still kinda dark in nature I believe. Their inspired by Thrall and so try to be honorable as well.   
---
The Forsaken are as their name imply's, Forsaken. They were resurrected as mindless warriors for the Lich king. However during his weakness they managed to regain control. They were shunned by the living and felt resentment especially since many of them gave their lives to save the living. So they kinda want to end all life. They only allied with the Horde for convenience, probably cause their kinda alone up their and surrounded by enemies who hate them.   
---
The Alliance is built on noble merits. However it does have a lot of corruption. Some of which you will see in the game. However they have suffered great tragedy at the hands of the orcs and the burning legion. Especially losing  Lordaeron and also having one of Stormwind's king's get assassinated by an Orc. Not to sure about the Dwarfs and Gnomes but they mostly seem noble. Nightelves are one of the more ancient races. A lot of them were corrupted by the legion especially most the royalty. They then summoned the legion into this world and were defeated by Malfurion and those who stood with him making up the current night elves.
---
&gt;3a. The power spike between a fresh lvl 60 and naxx is now already really big, if you give ppl stronger gear there is no chance for a fresh 60 to compete in any way  
---
&gt;3b. vertical progression for making hybrids viable is bad because (almost) all bad PvE specs, shine in PvP (ret pally, spriest etc) wow's problem is the balancing of both, pve and pvp
---
Dont't want to prove that I'm right, just tell me where I am wrong
---
I mean there's also a difference between then and now in that people weren't as aware how strong fury warriors could be with the proper gearing back then. Even in BC, loads of progression guilds only had warriors tank.
---
That is a bit of a problem. Maybe prior to release this subreddit could have a "friend finder megathread".
---
Miner Johnson is a rare spawn who can appear in a side tunnel. I believe the tunnel is in the passage after the shredder boss. The ghoul is for a quest before the instanced part of the Deadmines.
---
API changes are there to prevent exploits and abuse.
---
The debuff limit is Vanilla ("#nochanges").
---
Just look at the big picture. See the interviews (old or new), the Restoring History panel at Blizzcon and Blizzard's general attitude to bug reports in the beta. It's very obvious they are quite strictly aim to recreate Vanilla and no more.
---
Of course Vanilla/Classic is a very big game and Blizzard is made up of people with different opinions. Nothing ever will be absolutely clear cut. They aim for a faithful recreation but some things they deem exploits and won't recreate. It might be inconsistent in the details but that doesn't change the big picture.
---
And the Knights of Ni
---
Another blue post, another thing pservers got wrong and yet people cling to them pointing their fingers at how Blizz is ruining Classic.
---
I'm just saying, most people aren't going to be part of these streamer events with hundreds of people on both sides. The only times I remember something like that happening in vanilla, the game lagged to hell and the servers crashed anyway.
---
I like that
---
This is mostly true.
---
Basically, whether someone is wearing transmog gear or not really doesn't matter. I very rarely see people running builds that are against the current meta. Even if your secondary stats are not *optimal* for a specific build, you will see people running it because it's supposedly the best out there.
---
As for decisions: I do agree that *some* decisions were basically meant to patch up a survival period of 15 years. To put this into perspective: nobody working on vanilla ever thought they'd get so many players so quickly, would last this long, or even become this much of a pop-culture phenomenon. The surge of classic WoW, TBC, and the retention of WotLK was an utter surprise to most people.
---
They had 8 years of content when transmog became a thing just lying around and collecting dust.
---
So one person declining means cooperation is dead. And you felt the need to share this. Riiiiiiight.
---
He already said it, people are jealous
---
"I couldn't imagine taking the game so seriously that I would do a huge, involved quest just for a class mount." See? I can do it too.
---
That’s subjective though, to me, who can only squeeze in play time when I’m able to, that time will add up and it’s valuable
---
&gt;Back in the days i came across this myth that there's a hidden cave in blasted lands with a rare vendor that can spawn.
---
false, don't even need to read the rest of the post.
---
I can't say I have a lot of pserver experience because I preferred the real thing to the knock offs. But the threads from both pservers and the classic wow discussion are littered with people using it as a pejorative. It is synonymous with bad players that prefer easy and accessible content. It's so obvious it's hard to imagine you didn't pick up on it. I think your really over thinking it and missing the the forest for the trees.
---
It is the case just because they have changed the game in WOD does not mean that's how it was in vanilla.
---
You bet, bringing 4 friends with me - you?
---
\^\_\^
---
Salvation was simpler, but Grace of Air totem existed for certain groups, and you could always give your tank Windfury for a significant threat boost too. In addition they could be a Troll and Berserk for more threat.
---
This does make those strategies more dangerous, but they're still quite effective.
---
There were a fair number of bear druids back then. In fact, bear druids got an indirect buff from this. They attack slower so will incur less parries and will for sure be a better off tank than a fury warrior.
---
He hasn't explained anything other then values from WOD
---
For warlock it's not a huge deal, but it's still objectively better to have a normal mount. Paladin though ... you \*need\* a normal mount.
---
I tell you, 3 months long closed beta without nda was a mistake. People will get burnt out.
---
Many important changes are undocumented. Often times it was like the changelog notes in the apple app store:
---
"improved user experience. trust us. rate 5 stars"
---
TBC - but part of the ret talent tree can get you 8% running/mounted speed increase - 4% for each point used. Doesn’t stack w/ carrot tho 😞
---
When I bought BFA to try it out, as soon as I ran into Stormwind I was met with people on gigantic flying mounts, all multicoloured and no serious theme about them at all. In all honesty, it looked like a cross between a kids mobile game and a wacky circus. It was a terrible experience.
---
You already had a reduced chance of atleast 50%.
---
Yes they nerfed the tauren race hitrange in TBC because it was getting crazy and tauren warriors were BIS in pillar humping.
---
Someone made a better comparison than this pic here showing the differences, the new client is technically a wider FoV than the original from 04 due to aspect correction and scaling.
---
The "Tony the Tiger" mount.
---
Where could you buy this?
---
This was well after the peak load too (Australian prime time), so doubt it was stress test related :/
---
Also the box is broken
---
No just thin skinned. I personally have trouble respecting an opinion when the person won't even listen to the people he disagrees with.
---
The tiger is a tameable creature called King Bangalash on NW STV sitting on a mound surrounded by other tigers.. it is not a mount but a hunter's tameable pet
---
this is the 2nd time someone tried to pass this fake BS into this subreddit
---
Transmog was the worst addition to wow, anyone that tries to argue otherwise would rather play a dress up sim than a real rpg.
---
Firstly, if you wanna be more convincing don't exaggerate as much.
---
Second, everything you say also applies to Tank warriors as well, not just Ferals and Fury. 
---
Based on attack speed only (even though warriors in general have alot more abilities that can be parried, compared to Ferals) warriors with 1.5 attack speed will generally be hit by 6 faster attacks a minute where a druid will produce about 3.
---
It gave me a reason to drool over something and get me to log in every day.
---
I know most didn't like them, and to be honest there are far better options for itemizing end game... But not for the game retail has become, I don't think
---
Let me run in to 3 enemies. . . dies. . .pikachu face
---
While i agree, there are lots of cases of people who ditch responsibilities and play excessive amounts of hours per day.. and that gives us a really bad rep
---
It'll be like 3-4% less, but now dpsing from the front of the boss is super risky because when a mob/boss parries, it's next auto swing is sped up, so that can lead to unexpected burst on the tank, or even just more damage on the tank in a boss across a raid encounter, draining more healer mana.
---
Nice find. That seems wrong to me as well. Report it.
---
Solved!
---
I think Runescape has a free 30-day membership trial going on currently with Twitch Prime.
---
FFXIV also has a 7-day free log-in campaign going on too, on-top of whatever trial period it usually offers. And if you're eligible, you can do a returning player with a friend and get an additional 7 days. And if you create a character on a preferred world and get to level 30, you get an additional 15 days.
---
There's also Diablo 3 which can be pretty fun.
---
quivers were equipped in classic? i thought they were like bags. you could have a staff and a bow equipped at the same time?
---
&gt; unless they've said something beforehand.
---
Or unless it's a time-sensitive invite. If the mob's already down to 10%, and I get an invite from someone wanting in on the kill, I usually accept it.
---
If there *is* ample time for a greeting beforehand, and it doesn't happen, the invite comes across as rude - and I'll likely decline it on the general principle that someone who's too lazy to type "Hi" before asking something from me is likely not the type of person I want to help out.
---
No not really. It's a lot more bland and takes a ton of inventory space to make your character look good. I'd rather have function to the game over fashion.
---
Some people say yes, some say hell no, which means it should be decent.
---
BUT runescape has a lot more niche audience. WoW has the problem of catering to too many people.
---
In case of classic: PvE &amp; PvP, as said before: most of the Shit pve specs are good in pvp and vice versa
---
In case of retail: You have a lot of content for different people: Mount farmer, Transmog farmer/completer, achievements, Pet battles (yes there are people who play wow just for that), in addition to PvP &amp; PvE. 
---
In TBC they introduced PvP Resilience for making it easier to balance specs in pve &amp; pvp separatly. 
---
It's simply very hard for WoW to take that route simply because of balancing everything
---
“Let’s hope we can get some actual written explanations from Blizzard”
---
&gt;written blue post saying layering behaving like sharding is a bug
---
“THOSE AREN’T THE SAME!”
---
Do you remember how it used to go down at the camp? You'd call a friend, they'd call a friend and all of a sudden, all of Stormwind was in stv.
---
I think it's the other way around people who like to pvp would love a streamers scalp
---
Yes, and? That's what I said. Their guiding principle is "getting as close to Vanilla as is possible". Obviously they don't want exploits, they want to keep the costs down, etc. Their priorities are not the same as some random player.
---
No one reasonable expects "#nochanges" to mean *literally* no changes. (I never used the phrase exactly because of this.) It's a neat slogan if you understand that you can't take it absolutely literally. But it doesn't change Blizzard's attitude towards the game. They regard Classic as a museum piece. A playable museum piece but a museum piece regardless.
---
Rogues can reduce their threat so it's not a huge deal. But also cat druids put out ridiculously high threat, even with lower dps. This probably indirectly buffs Ret paladins and enhancement shamans. But not by very much.
---
So you're telling me not to tell people how to play?
---
I agree, I was never a big fan of TBC's caverns of time with the twilight flight, it feelt right up the alley with spaceships compared to original vanilla.
---
For the record this person was provided a blue post but then that wasn’t enough either because the two cases weren’t the exact same situation.
---
Pwn'd
---
We used a Druid tank, and kept him alive through 3 druid class calls on Nefarian.  It wasn't our first kill, but it was well before AQ came out.
---
I’m with you. Retail numbers are just crazy.
---
Yeah it's pretty much this. For a cat druid, you have to go so thoroughly deep into raiding before you get a weapon to drop that gives you a huge chunk of bonus attack power (ignoring the Gnomer weapon gimmick).
---
For sure, its just cringe.
---
Oh right - the ashbringer! The biggest of all myths in classic i guess. Maybe down the road blizz will implement something in classic to expand that myth ... although i'm not sure that would be a good thing.
---
That's also something great about myths/rumors - it opens up room for speculation... and i like that ;-)

"We noticed you don't have a Twitch following so you can't have beta access. However, look at this junk you can buy from us!"
---
This is WOD code in the Vanilla game gentlemen
---
Sure but that Salvation blessing might come at the cost of a Kings or Might.
---
I noticed I had 4 pieces of gear before finishing the verbs first wolf quest in the human zone. 
---
Definitely higher drop rates. Also the wolf meat seemed to be 100% drop rate and labeled as “quest item” and unable to be censored. 
---
All things are not vanilla -like
---
&gt; I will roll RP-PvP server regardless who is there!
---
Poor guy :(
---
Those days of Blizzard are long gone. Designers like David Brevik don't come around too often. And if they do, they won't be given enough breathing room to make "their" game in a big company like Blizzard.

I know you're foaming at the mouth to trash talk private servers, but he said that he made more money in the classic beta than on a private server.
---
You can keep pushing that archive date back and it never changes until it doesnt exists.  You could never in retail wow go into low level dungeons with 10 to my knowledge.  I have been subscribed since classic beta
---
If someone is "playing assassin" in MC, they won't be playing with me.
---
oof
---
ikr,  otherwise they'd run into possible enemies, allowing for a possible fight to occur
---
Yes but thousands of people are watching then, seeing what the character looks like, the map he's in, the quests he's doing etc...
---
It'll take no more than couple hours for people to figure out who is the streamer's char
---
I believe they were only visible if you drew your bow. I also have a screenshot with my char empty handed where the quiver doesn’t show. Just the staff.
---
Can we just start removing posts like this? 
---
Some points are valid in the argument but fuck sakes, how many times are we going to make threads about not wanting to be on a streamer server. You’re getting the game you wanted, so enjoy it. Wait a week to figure out where they all are and avoid it... whatever makes you happy. Y’all stressing over absolutely nothing.
---
Someone told you it was .2% each for the racial and you misunderstood and ran with it. The 0.2% comes from all 5 weapon skill levels added together. Its 0.04% each level.
---
Huh, I think you're right that it's me who isn't getting it. Thanks for clarifying. I'll have a deeper look tonight when I finish work.
---
Ahh yeh, a ‘ROLE playing game’ where everyone wears the exact same armour.
---
awesome! would you happen to still have the link?
---
Classic will spike at the start and destroy BFA for a while and then die out, look at streamers already having little to do. Sure its gonna last a lot longer at actual release with lvl 60 and more content but its gonna run out....  
---
Lets just hope the positives of Classic and people cleraly loving the return to them will catch on and BFA or the next expansion will have some nice changes!
---
&gt; The saddest thing is, they weren't able to do the low-level PVP battle in the area they wanted because they had too many people. Layering kicked in, and the Horde ended up on another layer, so the Horde's army ran right past the Alliance's army, without showing up on each other's screens.
---
That was a good thing in my opinion. Make no mistake, the Classic devs are closely watching these large group events. They know the two groups not meeting is BS as much as anyone else. Bringing attention to these kind of failings now is how you get solutions.
---
I don't want to play with them, but I sure as hell want to gank them.
---
Path of Exile is free and a billion times better than Diablo III.
---
epic t-shirt of cringe
---
Yeh 100%. Transmog was basically the most wanted feature since the beginning of wow. It gets boring seeing every single raiding warrior wearing T1 and 2
---
Just delete the post you didnt read anything about the test and took all this time to bash blizzard to be told by everyone it was intended
---
Outside of a lot of crafted armor being kinda bad (especially in tailoring because they never reworked the stats after nerfing spirit in alpha/beta), it's nice that everything is super neat and it's all part of the same world. 
---
The problem with each expansion is you're essentially only worried about what goes on in this one continent and with these few resources only found there.
---
No official source, "if" Baeza's formula is correct then it caps at 5%. The data gathered so far on the beta seems to fit the formula but a lot more testing is needed.
---
Damn, walljumping got me good
---
You used to be able to climb almost anything if you faced directly north, south, east or west
---
there was even a TomTom script that would show if you were perfectly N,S,E,W so you could climb
---
Thats the true feeling of classic, enjoy!!!
---
Barely. Miss the glory days of rbg (mop and wod).
---
1. Not really. Anyone guild needing a fury tank for threat reasons is now going to need one that much more. It's actually a buff to fury tanks over prot tanks because threat is going to be even more of an issue. 
---
2. You have a higher healthpool but are more susceptible to being crit'ed back to back due to low defense. If a warrior get's crit once he can immediately throw a shield on and use shield block to prevent the additional burst. 
---
I'm not saying ferals aren't viable, but the reasons you listed here don't really make alot of sense. 
---
You are correct, at least on private servers anyway, that bear threat is usually higher than a prot warrior. The amount of threat different tanking styles can generate is all theorycrafted guesswork on private servers at the moment and will have to be retested at end game in classic.
---
If bears still maintain a significant threat advantage in classic it will help them out a lot. I don't see much of a reason at all to bring a bear tank over a warrior tank without that threat advantage. That said many guilds won't need the 'best' tank, they will just need 'a' tank and feral is certainly viable enough to tank raids even if it isn't ideal.
---
Yea meant log in on launch day to start rested...not worth the fighting for.mobs
---
The only real progress they made with wow in all these years was the actual raid quality, and also class evolution and gameplay has improved. MoP was peak in this department, but the rest of the game has seemingly taken steps backward.
---
Vanilla would have been perfect if the classes were a little more fleshed out and they had the tech to remove the debuff limit and they had a few more years of raid encounter design under their belt. Also itemization for hybrids not being +healing only in Naxx.
---
For what it's worth (and as a software developer), I thought the same thing as you.
---
That's correct.
---
Now reread my post. If drop rates on pservers are higher you need to kill fewer mobs. Less money, less junk to sell.
---
Follow?
---
How I got into every last one I've been in, including the stress tests.
---
Known potential error situations may be logged, because we can predict them beforehand.
---
How do you tell s system to log an error you don't expect it even conceive of being possible? What if the error isn't breaking with the intended function of the system?
---
Since he mentioned being in automation, take the example of the printer.   
---
How do you create software to log and report a produced page not being as expected?  
---
Lets say there's something fucky with the lowercase E.    
---
Everything worked perfectly fine until the printer head melted the plastic wrong when doing the Es.
---
How do you log that? How does the printer know it fucked up?   
---
It can't.   
---
Even if the printer logs everything the user has to press a fucking button to tell support "this is when it happened".
---
Plenty of systems rely on manual logging and they are not weird, nor are they necessarily bad.
---
I’ve played it for a while on a pserver, what you read is just not true. As a healer they are pretty much the most wanted class on Horde side due to their amazing raid healing capability and the enormous buffs they provide with totems.
---
As you have the only multi-target smart heal you can easily top healing meters (not that it matters that much), and their healing style is quite fun, you will be constantly recasting totems while spamming different ranks of Chain heal on low health targets (preferably bunched together, the Warlocks are a good choice if the fight is not that intense) and of course the occassional instant cast Healing Wave to save the tank in a critical encounter.
---
It was the most fun class I’ve played in end-game PvE, going to play a Priest this time though, as I prefer their leveling experience and I don’t want to spend too much on respecs.
---
Oh okay thanks. I wasn't sure about the reasons why it was viable back in Wrath so that's cool to know.
---
I fully agree with this sentiment.
---
Transmog worked for retail's situation and for what it was supposed to become. It does not work for classic and its design philosophy of making the gear you *earned* a status symbol from far away.  
---
As a roleplayer, I can relate to the issue. I hated carrying around an armour, civilian clothing, travel gear and all these things. Now, I can simply have a PvE set of gear and a set of transmog gear and switch with the click of a button.
---
This is a *convenient* feature, but it also means people use outlandish sets more often. "Simple" clothes and armour sets are buried under a tsunami of shining, new, fancy armour sets.
---
I remember that more people wore simple robes and pointy hats, the defias leather armour or a set of scarlet crusade chainmail armour back in the day. The reason for that was simple: you didn't have a decade or more of easily accessible tier sets.
---
Obtaining the mail gear from Scarlet Monastery was a good way to get the "warrior look" and have a matching set. And I remember using the Robes of Doan, Illusionary Rod, a pointy hat and the shoulders for *ages* back when I was RPing a human warlock.
---
 I like creativity. I like options. Don't get me wrong. I'd not want for transmog to go away in retail. But classic was a different time in the lore as well. Things weren't big. I knew more apprentices, simple soldiers and priests back in the day. Retail has become a more *high-fantasy* infused setting, which is fine - spaceships, moral duality, tons of cosmic factions, void elves and space-marine Draenei. That's fine for what the game is at the moment.
---
But for classic RP, I'd like to go "back to the basics." A warrior in mail gear is awesome, a wizard with a pointy hat is funny, and a dragon or doomguard is a force to be reconned with.
---
No, trust me it's a recurring problem with razer mouses. It only lasts for about half a second. It would also move around sporadically. My boyfriend had the same issue and it's a hardware problem with the Naga mouse. https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2291093-Random-mouse-acceleration-since-7-3
---
That's the point he's making.  Less Arms warriors means more people fighting for 1-handed weapons.
---
Yeah BC had a lot going for it, I hope if Blizzard launches a BC server they don't have nerfed content like 2.4. The whole excuse that the last patch is always the most polished in every aspect is BS.
---
&gt; Of course the vendor never showed up ... after all it was just a myth. 
---
If you read my story it is very clear that i'm not saying that this myth is true! **My story is about the adventure that such a myth leads to** and that i enjoyed this experience. Never ever did i say that the vendor is real. But the cave was real and we went there.
---
Guess there are always people that think they are all-knowing after reading just the first sentence.
---
stress test is for lvl 1 naked boxing championships not lvl 5 pvp
---
And it sucks having to keep pieces just to look good when you get an upgrade that looks garbo
---
Roccat Nyth
---
In Classic? Nope! You will absolutely abandon dozens and dozens of quests as you level. 
---
On Beta 1-25 so far I’ve abandoned like 20-30 quests because I outleveled that area. After level 13 or so everything is really non-linear and there are probably 2-3x more quests than you need. Plus a lot of hubs have wildly different quest levels mixed together. By the time I got to Redridge I picked up two quests in Lakeshire I immediately abandoned because there were way too low. 
---
Classic is all about picking and choosing which quests have the least travel time and the most things to kill. The large majority of your exp comes from killing things, quests are very lightly sprinkled throughout.
---
I feel you. 100%. I'm very torn between Warrior, Rogue, and Priest. I'll make all three eventually, but starting I just don't know. 
---
* They're both good at that.
---
* Again, both good at it!
---
* Still both great at it
---
* I'd have to say Rogue looks cooler
---
* and finally... both of those are the most common besides warriors. 
---
I don't feel like I helped much lol.
---
Premade? Go mage 
---
That was easy
---
We've had Druid tanks on 4HM.  It wasn't regular but it did happen, particularly if a tank went down (because it was an 8 tank encounter).
---
I was Alliance on a PVP server on my first character, and Wetlands was my first Contested zone. I was looking around wildly the while time, tense for a fight! It was amazing.
---
Did you think he was a toddler 14 years ago?
---
Haha cool!
---
Yeah i really thought that was epic that the only way to get it done for Avolc was to get it from you :), I just felt that the great thing about vanilla was the story we all created by the things we did, the game was really great back then.
---
Yeah I'm doing well, cant wait for wow classic to begin :), How about you? did you continue playing on AD, and will you play classic?
---
Not really.. fellow Scandinavian. I'm from Sweden :)
---
 Horde. Pick my race. = Undead
---
I like duels a LOT = Rogue/Mage
---
I like bgs and want a premade space = Mage Will have more spots I bet
---
Idc about levelling speed = Mage
---
I want cool looking gear = depends on you
---
I would prefer the lesser played of the two, but can't work out which that is = Rogue is less played I think. At least on the ps i play its full of mages and warlocks. Still premades look for mages
---
Yeah except all the furies have wf too so it really doesn't change much.
---
Rogue.
---
If you want cool looking gear, leather beats cloth every time.  If you don't mind bony elbows and spines sticking through your armor, go Undead.
---
Otherwise (to avoid stretched textures) do with female Orc, they have the closest dimensions to the human model that the textures are optimised  for.
---
Can you explain why transmog is so bad for the game?
---
You mean Azmongold won't be Rank 14 and have Naxx on Farm 1st week of release? Damn
---
Most people get that it's a persona, but when he only ever shows this persona we only see the version of him that a lot of folks dislike. 
---
I think it's perfectly valid to dislike him for the persona he puts on 90% of the time.
---
Feign death resisted
---
I really don't think people hate him. I think that people that are most spiteful about things feel the urge to be the loudest. If you don't like the guy, just don't look at his stream, videos and stop making nonsensical topics on this sub. It's really that simple. 
---
I daresay that most people actually like him. I mean just look at all the viewership he gets on random videos on YouTube. I personally really like him. He's got that eloquence that I really like and he always has opinions on random shit.
---
I agree. I played for several hours last night and the nostalgia of playing the beta back before vanilla originally came out came back to me. Only this time everything works. It's like 15 years of hardware upgrades really paid off. Lol  seriously though it seems people are nicer on the beta test realm rather than focusing on the grind, you are enjoying the experience of it all. I hope the need for CC in dungeons makes for a better current game player base. I really hope the need for a community of friends bleeds into the current game as well since it has been no longer needed since lfr and lfg became a thing. We shall see, but either way I really love the slow pace of classic wow. -Bakd-
---
Dayz style
---
Lol, it's not streamer-only server dude.... it's streamer+his/her followers. All of them in only one server.
---
No different from being level capped in the same area.
---
Sounds like both druid tanks and dual wielding warriors will not be viable. No point in arguing which one is hurt more by this revelation.
---
Eh, not really. ToC/ICC was the prime time of theorycrafting DualWield DK tanking and we got parry-haste merc’d like crazy in ICC.
---
Okey, I see you point. For threat reasons Fury will be better, but still squishier as they maintain a higher Parry rate over time. Even though they won't get crit, they will take even more overall dmg than before, Ferals less.
---
I'm awful at math so that's probably a good idea.
---
thats cool. i dont remember that but its awesome if thats how it was.
---
I remember the first time I took the flight path from SW to IF. **BLEW MY MIND**. I first took the tram from IF to SW, grabbed the flight path and flew back.
---
 I couldn't fucking believe how big the world was. It looked *so dangerous*. I had trouble taking down Defias...I didn't think I would ever ever be able to stand against a dragon like the one I saw on that flight path. 
---
Demonic looking alters, flowing lava, mobs so high level it just showed a skull. Felt like I was flying over a battle field and I could be shot down any moment. 
---
I aspired to find a way to get on that mountain and help kill that dragon. 
---
There is so many cool things to look at the first time you do that ride. It really is something else.
---
You dont need to be a streamer to form a 5man/raid and go ganking.
---
I'll disagree with this suggestion, and offer the suggestion that this is likely more a matter of personal preference. *I* like my music in games to be ambient, sort of an enhanced background noise that feels like it's actually part of the game. Constantly playing music doesn't achieve that - I want for that music to kick in sometime, then fade out again.
---
On a related note, I've seen them usic for latter expansions often praised, and just as often, I cannot get behind that praise. Yes, if listened to exclusively for one time, a (say) piece of the BfA soundtrack sounds really good. But having this epic score on constant blast, even when nothing epic is happening, and doesn't happen in the next two hours, is emotionally exhausting for me. I'm still grateful that Blizzard put in shortcuts to mute music and sound (CTRL+M, CTRL+S), so I can silence either whenever necessary. Otherwise, I'd turn down the music completely in modern WoW.
---
And again, that's not to say the music is *bad*, but it's just too much and overbearing for me to constantly listen to it. Even Classic's score, which is much more ambient and unobtrusive, can be grating if played on a loop. I guess that's why it's not the default option - but it *is* an option for those that absolutely cannot get enough of it.
---
Definitely brings me back to when I started playing in 05’! There’s something special about this game and it isn’t just nostalgia!
---
&gt; We have to be prepared for what's to come with Classics launch. The developers have hinted at TBC dropping at some point, *But only if the player base demands it*. For those of you who have issues with the way expansions are implemented, you need to realize that these old problems will absolutely return. And if you don't want them to, you need to make that clear to the developers. You need to let them know that The Burning Crusade should not render WoW's base content moot. Or let them know that you simply do not want expansion content to be implemented the way it was in the past. 
---
I think this is become more and more relevant to Classic players. One year ago, 80%+ wanted TBC, 10% wanted post-Naxx content, and 10% were just avoiding the subject.
---
Today, it's a hard split of 60% TBC vs 40% 1.13...and it will go in favor of 1.13 the more time it passes, and especially after Classic launches. People will realize that TBC after Classic is the worst idea. Ever.
---
I think Blizzard understands that 1.13 is the better option for game longevity AND their income. OSRS proved that. There is the precedent. It's not like they are going blind.
---
Most anti-1.13 people are afraid that Blizzard will ruin Classic with 1.13. It is expected, after seeing what Blizzard did in the last years, with WoD, Legion, BfA, Diablo, etc.
---
A post-Naxx horizontal content can be delivered as a server option, with a character copy from Classic to Classic+. Same for TBC. Character copy. TBC is ALREADY there, doesn't need "reforging" of 7.3.5 and 1.12 data as Classic needed to work.
---
So, providing an option for TBC, as a character copy, is a minimal investment for Blizzard, but they MUST also provide 1.13, and a character copy option, because if they don't, Classic servers will simply lose 95% of their population, half of them going to TBC and the other half of them stop playing.
---
There are plenty of reasons why almost half of the players reject it. Flying mounts, raid size reduction, dailies, badge gear, new professions, old content made obsolete, etc. etc. Those people (me being among them) will not play TBC and will also stop playing Classic, because there won't be anything MEANINGFUL left to do in Classic after 2-3 years.
---
Whether people are afraid of 1.13 or not, there is no other solution for the longevity and stability of Classic. TBC is just 2 years of content, for half the Classic players. And that is today. As I said, more and more players will understand that 1.13 is the way to go. If Blizzard will fail...they will fail.
---
But asking for TBC just because some people are 100% SURE that Blizzard will fail, even before they do it, it's a fallacy.
---
The same people were also 100% sure that Blizzard will fail with Classic, and private servers are "the better Vanilla", and there were plenty of them.
---
And the same way those people are a very small minority now, the same way TBC supporters will become a smaller minority 1 year from now.
---
Rogue because theres to many damn mages already!
---
It ruins immersion, you can’t tell how geared anyone is anymore, you don’t need to work hard to look decent, you gain no joy from getting a decent looking item now because everyone just transmogs into older sets.  Transmog is bad for games, other games that do it have died too, and all that’s left are the hello kitty dress up players walking about trying to show off their old armour sets.
---
* A 'decent' hunter cannot take most classes 1v1. A good or great hunter, can. There is a steep learning curve. BM makes it easier though, but I don't remember how strong they were back then. I remember them being nasty in TBC though... until someone just waited out your cooldown : P
---
* Yep! You got ammunition to craft AND quivers! Very important stuff

* Hunters were never top tier in PVP. When it comes to BGs they were quite helpful though between traps and shots. Seriously good back liners to have. They were second to top if you were an absolute master, and otherwise third from the top if you were good/great. I'm curious as to if their Traps will suffer diminishing returns or not. 
---
* Engineering + Mining. I mean, you can do something else to make $$, then start burning $$ later to grind out engineering 300. That's what I recall doing and I don't regret it. You don't make much off of engineering in general so... seems like a good choice.
---
Good luck out there

I’d say rogue just because I personally find it more enjoyable than mage.   
---
Something about wands really turns me off to all casters.
---
You can't have a space in your name on any server to be fair
---
Not to mention the fact that 90% of the 'Class' mounts in the game came from Legion.
---
No, how would it be regulated?
---
Stress Tests |= Beta.
---
because it isn't about admin it's about people being terrible humans.
---
Imagine standing in front of Patchwerk if you're not a tank.
---
Buying gold has been banable forever.
---
Even then, thousands will already know who is the streamer and the server they're on. We're back to the same "streamer server" problem
---
Good dps is always almost limited by threat generation on horde side. Exceptions on fights where tanks get to grab a huge lead or are fed unlimited rage because of boss damage (like chromag and nef for example).
---
Any boss where dps and tanks can start at the same time is threat limited unless the dps suck.
---
im a rogue
---
no wow tokens for classic, i think its even an entity separate game client, they want to keep the classic economy etc in check/how it was.
---
Thanks for pointing it out. I've edited my comment and provided a new example.
---
So what you're saying is roll a warlock. Got it
---
What do you mean? I was notified of my Beta invite via e-mail.
---
The program does know it is a bug, because it prompted the user "something happened, would you like to send logs".  As such, it could write a log entry with the 'error' descriptor and an appropriate severity level. 
---
Even without a bug report (which i'm not saying that they don't have their uses), a developer should be able to easily find the stack trace of the exception that caused the user prompt, just by searching the application logs for logs with the 'error' descriptor.
---
What the bug report provides is context as to what the user is doing when the error occurred, which can help duplicate the event where the error occurred.
---
BRE is over valued in private servers because the boss armor is exceptionally higher on most (besides k3 being closer to classic where the dps numbers were insane). And people arent even acknowledging the fact extra swing procs like wind fury and sword spec arent resetting swing timers. 
---
The parry change won't affect good tanks it will provide more rage to play with if anything and the classic raid dps is going to be much more inflated.
---
Yeh the old ‘city wear’ gear haha. Took up half the bag slots.
---
Correct
---
I don't think everyone is universally happy with pruned skills, professions, and complexity.
---
Mana not being a real resource anymore leads to so many classes having some other resource mechanic that just feels tacked on to me.
---
lulwut
---
&gt; the expansion model for MMOs
---
You’re speaking specifically about WoW’s Expansión model, not all MMOs. For example, GuildWars2 doesn’t nullify content because neither the level cap or item power level goes up with expansions, it just provides new stat combinations. So if you play a condition heavy class, you might need to go farm Heart of Thorns (old expac) for Viper gear.
---
I think they just want to avoid names like Ihealzyou, youdontcme things like that.
---
Yes, and Patchwerk.
---
There are almost zero hunter spots and hunters are a very popular class. If you get to be the unicorn that finds a naxx guild who's hasnt got their 1-2 hunter spots covered as a fresh lvl 60 with only a bit of ZG gear, you should play the lottery instead of World of Warcraft. And it's still a fucking boost. You're doing 50-75% of your supposed throughput and it gets covered by the other 29 dps because for some reason they needed an undergeared hunter.
---
Damn i thought hunters had a chance against most classes. Who do they have problems with?
---
Casual enough to only play every few months here and there.  Gonna be on classic every day until it dies or I do
---
Really glad these next few months will be my busiest as a hay farmer. As far as games I've really enjoyed AC Odyssey and gonna try to knock a few games off my backlog before I take the deep nostalgic dive back into my high school days. It'll be here before we know it.
---
Sry i'm an idiot. deleting
---
I love this exchange
---
I’m not arguing, just framing what 3% looks like
---
Out of interest, what's stopping a Fury Warrior from tanking with a 2h?
---
The limiting factor on group lvling changes when you start to outpace the area you are in, ie 2 people would be fine in most places w/o having to wait for mobs to respawn or to make sure you are w/i range of each other to receive the kill xp. With 3, 4, and 5 people it become increasingly difficult to manage to have enough potential kills to fill the void the larger group makes.
---
Or, as grown adults, we have the financial wellbeing and security that dropping $150ish sub advancement on a game we already intend on playing longterm is not a big deal.
---
This is so wrong, I can't even think how you came up with " Nobody is going to be farming hydraxian warlords rep when the naxx phase is released ".
---
Do you somehow think that new players will just go straight to Naxx after dinging 60?
---
Think you will only have trouble against shadow priest and warlocks
---
i'm not trying to pass anything fake as real ... this is just an experience that i made in classic and i'm looking forward to this kind of adventure again. I clearly said that the vendor is just a myth and i did never encounter him nor do i believe that this vendor does exist at all. 
---
Again... *It's about the myth that leads to a great journey ingame.*
---
Uhhh is that how the raid frames are going to look?
---
Don't we need something that differentiates groups in order to build raid groups in the age of group wide buffs?
---
yeah mage and rogue are differently 2 of the most played classes and both good at duels, rogue is  better for ganking/been a dick if thats your thing.
---
I don’t hate him, I am just sick of seeing him everywhere.  I don’t play the game to see him, yet every day, there he is.  The entitlement is strong with “content creators.”
---
wait what happened to warlocks?
---
How would it prompt the user if it didn't know it was an error?
---
So bloodlust will be even more useless?
---
Theres a cave  kinda like that in the quite similar demon area w/i winterspring.
---
I remember when they added it, and right off the bat it did not make any sense to me. I didn't play at the time, but I bought BFA, and hopped on an old character, 55 hunter, and I headed out to Westfall for some nostalgia. Forgot about leveling scaling and I find all the mobs are the same level as me. 
---
*what the fuck did they do to Westfall?* 
---
Then I remembered leveling scaling and how manufactured the world felt because of it.
---
Wow. Thanks
---
&gt;1 person group = 1.0  
---
&gt;2 person group = 1.0  
---
&gt;3 person group = 1.166  
---
&gt;4 person group = 1.3  
---
&gt;5 person group = 1.4
---
I think you might have misread the data, I added values so it's easier:
---
\*Just imagine you get 50xp per boar at lvl 1 alone\*
---
1 person group = 50xp
---
2 person group = 50xp (25xp each)
---
3 person group = 58xp (19xp each)
---
4 person group = 65xp (16xp each)
---
5 person group = 70xp (14xp each)
---
So if you were looking to be effective in grinding mobs in a group you pretty much have to make sure you are killing mobs quicker to match the 50xp per mob you would get alone (in thoery).
---
For example a 2 person group would have to kill 2 mobs in the time 1 person kills 1 mob and so on.
---
This obviously doesnt factor in down time as playing alone will often create more downtime than playing in duo or groups depending on class and combinations. If you have a group with a Healer that makes a huge difference.
---
but i don't think those people are the majority, at least they aren't in my experience. its unfortunate because so many of us manage our time well and strike a good balance between gaming and real life responsibilities. its just the ones who mess up and let their gaming turn into an obsession and ruin their lives that get a ton of attention
---
&gt;Because PoE has resets and people only play sporadically in 1-2 month bursts or less then they don't need such a big increase in power because everyone is A. reset and B. most havent been playing (read: raiding for that ilvl of gear).
---
People in trade league have top end gear after a week if they are good. The thing about powercreep in PoE is simply: you dont need it to do all content. Just chose a cheap and effective meta build. Imagine you only need 1/10th of the power of your WoW endgame gear to do the hardest boss. 
---
On standard league in PoE people have the most broken gear and builds and yet they are only slightly faster in killing endgame bosses than on live server. And farming maps (AoE, clear speed) isnt even faster if you play in a group since supports are a huge powerhouse. 
---
In PoE you dont get stronger every league, not because it doesnt last long, but because no better/stronger things are implemented. Only thing that changes is HOW you clear maps, not how fast. Sometimes theres an exception like winter orb this league. But even that isnt much better than other meta skills in previous leagues.
---
Last league i played ssf (solo self found league) and got rank 5. Did every content, even the hardest boss in the game on my first try ever. Simply because i played a strong, safe and cheap to gear meta build. It wasnt a top clear speed build tho (Miner). So well, knowledge, time efficiency and your build itself mean more in PoE than gear, by far. Heck, people on hc ssf constantly beat people in hc trade league simply because they are better players. 
---
&gt;The issue with what you are saying is that WoW mythic when you're pushing it at the level its really intended (pre nerf, pre over gear, pre catchup mechanics) is already mechanically very demanding.
---
Following up from my previous sentence. Im in no way saying wow isnt hard on the top level. Its just that mechanics would in my opinion be sufficient to keep new raids interesting. The thing is to be played you need to hand out rewards. You need a reason to keep on playing, else everyone would cancel their sub after one month into a new expansion. 
---
&gt;But again, that has the same issue and/or makes it feel like an odd hamster wheel where you're getting gear that isnt an upgrade but is just the same as you already have but has a fancy word on it that only applies when in that raid.
---
Exactly. Its simply a very hard to solve issue for blizzard to keep the game interesting after all those years. 
---
&gt;The other aspect is Blizzard likely has metrics which help guide them. Our personal 'feelings' of what does/doesn't work matter less than what the objective metrics tell them.
---
Yet WoW lost lots of players since the WotLK and Cataclysm peak. In no way thats only because the game got old and people found new games. Also the Classic hype isnt only because of nostalgia. Its harder, its simpler and not as overwhelming. You have to put lots of time into it, so people will keep playing for a while. The social aspect is also way more important from what i heard.
---
You are totally right about why PoE gets hyped so much every league (your last comment). New leagues are always fun, no matter how much new content is released. You cant do that in a mmo. I just hope Blizz will come up with something in the future. Maybe build up on Classic with WotLK etc. re-releases for a start.
---
At least you are not alone 😅
---
thanks for the confirmation
---
as somebody who raided as everything but naxx in true vanilla let me say that fury was still heavy stacked 6-8 furrys was not uncommon, its absolute hell trying to get 1h weapon as melee class as long you are not a tank.
---
&gt;classicmoments
---
please fuck off nobody needs this cancer
---
I don't really like him but I still watch his videos because he gets lots of exclusive info and interviews with blizzard devs.
---
I was not aware of this! So they increased the difficulty to give a more identical experience, not necessary a 1 to 1 copy of the original game. Thank you for informing me mate! And thank you for this calm discussion. This does not change my own opinion however as i would like to know that i am playing on something that is as close to the old game as possible, but i can clearly see why some might want the difficulty to increase. Have a great day, and I'll see you ingame come august :)
---
I remember believing this! I also thought the vendor spawn time was linked to whether the Bengal tiger skin was on the npc mount parked outside of Gadgetzan. Oh, and a player received a different Saber mount skin from a GM which also solidified the rumor for me haha. Of course there was no secret vendor... Exploring forbidden areas are some of my funnest memories of classic. Man, I miss wall walking.
---
With all the games out there, people can't find or be interested in anything else to play ? :P
---
Thanks but unless I'm missing something in the comments, this show only alliance.  I'm looking for horde data.
---
Absolutely. As someone planning on playing a dps warrior though I'm so fucking torn. They have some of the most amazing sets and I'm going to look like a clown. Part of my brain irrationally wants to allow full set transmog for tier gear only... But alas... Clown it is
---
Ok. Sure. You're right. It's a bad weapon because it takes 40-60 min to get at level 20 and matches stats with &lt;1% WORLD DROP WEAPONS from lvl 24 and RARE weapon drops from dungeon bosses. So to summarize, a quest that takes you 40-60 minutes at level 20 (because you take 4 other fucking paladins that wont leave like I specified) AND GUARANTEES AN ITEM is not as good as a &lt;1% world drop weapon and 2 rare weapon drops from bosses at level 29/30. Ok. Cool.
---
# What?
---
That was fixed in patch 1.3
---
Been looking for this link sense it got replaced, thanks!
---
[I beg to differ!](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Linken)
---
Source on 5.6% parry in pservers?
---
How so? I mean, I play on Kel'Thuzad and have never seen Asmongold or Sodapoppin, like ever. The only reason I even found out they were on the server was from a seeing a random video on YouTube.
---
did something new come out about cross realms? thought that wasnt going to be in classic
---
no more heirlooms !!! foocking ay!
---
Trying a few different rogue lites
---
Blizzard in numerous interviews have stated the following:
---
1) No wow token in classic, yes you can purchase it in retail for a active subscription.
---
2) Nothing from retail will make it into classic.
---
But just think about what your saying, a BFA economy where spending 500g is pocket change it would be game breaking, you might aswell say "Oh will lvl 120 epic sets be transferable?"
---
for 1v1 rogues and mages are both pretty similar, but in bgs mages are defs gonna be better. rogues are way better at open world pvp and dont shine so much in team environments. rogue tier sets are literally the best looking ones out of anything ever so you got that down.    
---
you dont have a preference with playstyle at all? going melee vs caster is completely different. personally i prefer melee because i cant stand stopping to drink all the time. especially in dungeons. its so damn nice not having to. all you should need is to keep your first aid skill up to date and youd barely have to stop to eat as a rogue. id say more people would be rolling mage as well because of how good it is as a farming class, so therell be more around for that reason.
---
This is unacceptable
---
Hey I haven’t seen this posted in “checks watch” about two hours
---
i thought it was a pie in the sky sort of project. nice idea, will be dropped quickly
---
Or a game where you decide how you want to look, rather than just settling for what the designer did. 
---
Transmog was fine, a bit comical to read it labelled as the 'worst addition' to the game, though.
---
Goldshire is aids
---
I'm interested to learn about this too.  Unfortunately, I think you're going to find that answers run the entire span of people not taking it seriously at all to people taking it super serious.  You could do what I've done and make a character on various RP servers, then just go around and observe in cities for the random RP going on.  I'm sure its not a good indicator or private or guild RP but its a start.
---
As much as i know that layering wouldnt be bad for the launch and another week or two after i just cant agree to it beeing in the game. Dynamic respawns were a thing back in vanilla why not work on setting that up again? Instead we get reworded sharding from retail that WILL 100% ruin the economy and its going to break the immersion as stuff like this is going to be happening for sure.  Its the only thing that i dont like about classic.
---
If you think this is funny you're S-tier human trash.
---
Depression is no joke and the remedies vary for each person.
---
I had don't think scaling was the final blow to wow but I personally hate it in every single mmorpg that has it. The modern day concepts of what an mmorpg should be is so distorted.
---
Fucking bad bot.
---
Very reasonable opinion. Apparently people in this thread are using downvotes as an "I disagree" button and not a "did not contribute to the discussion" button. Your comment is well-outlined and while many may disagree there are some interesting points to be seen here. It's really hard to explain all the benefits of a system without transmog, but this does touch on it.
---
Same. I got into the beta, and for whatever reason I got an email 2 days later letting me know I got into it lol but still, point is the same - there's definitely an email for the beta.
---
Go play Dota 2.
---
I don't mind waiting in a queue if it means consistent, single world
---
Delete this stupid school project bot...
---
Not an issue if you coordinate with a healer to time heals to top you off.
---
And ye, not a great difference really.
---
I'm waiting for classic and doom eternal, that's it
---
We (the non-RPers) will call you cres and you will think to yourself “they are too lazy to even throw the t on the end”
---
If you want to be a female night elf with an 18 inch gearthy dong then RP servers are for you.
---
They have a lot of trouble with warriors,rogues when they are simply in a 1vs1. Any class that can comfortable engage a hunter in melee and/stay in their dead zone is tough to fight. In battlegrounds hunters are much stronger. They have the ability to chose almost all their engagements and fighting a warrior from max range with traps to kite with is a much more tenable situation. Druids can be difficult with their many forms of gap closing and their ability to soak the damage while getting in range. Hunters are absolutely powerhouses when they can keep their range up but plenty of classes have decent answers for them.
---
He wasn’t trying to ‘pass this fake BS into this subreddit’.  Did you even read it?
---
Without any evidence to support this claim. Nice.
---
But things that made WoW Classic great were the lack of flying/LFG/LFR/CRZ and the easiest content available *still* being relatively difficult, meaning everything in the game gave an incentive to group up and socialize. (But yes, mana being an actual resource was part of it too)
---
Try mentioning removing flying/LFG/LFR/CRZ in /r/wow or to most current WoW players and see their reaction
---
Something about cake and eating it
---
No, because that makes no sense.
---
Drop rate has no effect on how many mobs it requires to kill to reach a certain level. Assuming you do the same quests, the amount of mobs you kill to reach level x is more or less a constant, with some variation depending on mob level.
---
If the drop rate is higher across an equivalent number of mobs, you would end up with on average more things to sell and therefore more money.
---
train your staff skills in the badlands/blasted lands
---
Absolutely wrong - as a matter of fact this change makes bears better than warriors in T0/T1 because bears produce more TPS than warriors in pre-raid BiS. 
---
These parry values will make TPS more valuable, not less, increasing the value of bear druids overall. Bears can also selectively increase TPS by burning more charges of MCP. Survivability looks like it overall will be easier than on Pservers, nullifying any concerns that druids will be less survivable than warriors (they did fine on Pservers with higher boss damage). 
---
So I’m happy to say overall the results of this are the exact opposite of what you said. Bear druids will be he best tank in the game until BWL, and will thereafter trade back and forth with warriors based on phases of itemization. If fury/prof dual wielding is hit too hard by this, bears may end up as the penultimate tank in Naxx too. Thanks for playing!
---
This sub hit its peak a while ago with all the dog memes and office gifs.
---
Then u reroll to a bigger server. Nothing new.
---
I don’t think you understand the vast amount of data created by automated systems. Without a time stamp to help you pin down where the issue occurred, a report of “it was acting funny” isn’t of any use at all.
---
What this guy said when it comes down to profs and making money. There were so many different mats and stuff you could farm in the world and epics at tyrs hand.
---
For one that declined today, three others accepted. Even had a nice chat with a Russian dude!
---
Tell me when the time hits!
---
Ironic is the word that comes to my mind.
---
Staged, but yeah.
---
I'd be on board with making it client side only I think. If you want to look however you want, have at it. On my end, if I could tick a box that turns it off I would be a happy camper. I think even an agreeable middle ground could be to enable it by default as an option. That way people like me can just turn it off to see more accuracy and the RPers could make sure it's on for convenience sake. I know part of the appeal of transmog is how other people see you, but I suppose people would just have to accept that there is no way to know if someone has it disabled or not.
---
idk about you guys but once Classic is out I probably won't post here ever again
---
This is so wrong I don't don't even know where to begin. 
---
Costumes/appearance customization is one of the "must haves" in any modern game now, along with some type of housing and some form of group finder (not necessarily cross realm junk, but some type of UI to do it rather than spamming chat channels)
---
Hi, /u/ggxmembersonly
---
Yeh it’s not a make or break thing for a lot of people, but it kinda makes sense in a role playing game to you know, actually choose how you look? 
---
People are entitled to opinions, doesn’t make them any less stupid though.
---
I really hope for RP-PVP server
---
Halo 3 was the Halo killer.
---
Stop posting this swill. Nobody wants to see it.
---
Your name examples are just fine. I saw a few people being forced to change their names, but those were "myunderwear", "metallica" and "donthealme". So you will have nothing to worry about renaming :)
---
I mean this is kind of the all time important point. You can easily find yourself as lord of the flies as any class. There's going to be a guild out there with a feral druid in top 3 dps because they know the gimmicks and utilize them, and the rest of their guild is terrible. That's the beauty of vanilla, you can find yourself in your own little guild ecosystem that works for you, regardless of the "meta"
---
you are presuming they are going to have an RP server. Unless server info is already out?
---
There aren't any plans for RP-PvP unfortunately.
---
On mobile so cba to actually find it but look like 5 posts back in my comment history.
---
Frost Mages will give you a run for your money too. Good Druids will probably kick your ass regardless of what you do as they can switch forms and remove movement impeding shit, tank your damage as bear, bleed you as cat, heal(usually a renew), and keep with the paces. Paladins will just be too hard to kill and will inevitably simply outlast you. Shaman shouldn't be too much trouble, but you'll only ever fight those in Duels anyways. Sub Rogues(decent ones, and other types of rogues will be easy) will likely beat you, even if ya tag em. Warriors shouldn't be an issue for a long time.. as they have a predictable path and mentality. I don't recall if there were Trinkets that take you out of CC in 1.12, but if there are, it's definitely going to mess you up. Don't forget that every warrior and his mom will also have a Freedom of Movement potion too. Scary stuff.
---
* Your kite game has to be strong
---
* You need to know your deadzone, your max range, and the range of abilities like Intercept, and keep yourself in a perfect deadzone range of those
---
* You need to have high situational awareness with what abilities other classes use, so you know when to Scatter Shot, Stun, Concussive, Trap, etc
---
* You need to learn how to control your pet very well, so you can tell it to stop attacking when needed(so it doesn't break a trap)
---
* You have to be careful when applying any DoTs, as A. they aren't very strong and B. they will break any CC you may need in the next 9 seconds or so(that's a long time in combat)
---
* You've got to have pretty good gear overall
---
* You unfortunately don't scale well at all later on, and all of these classes will just become harder to face once they are at the same tier or higher in terms of raid gear and pvp gear(marshals and shit)
---
* Be ready to throw down Deterrence and that Raptor/Mongoose strike.
---
A disturbingly good metaphor.
---
You’re on the wrong subreddit man,  get back on bfa if you want all of that.  This is a subreddit for classic wow which had none of what you just mentioned.
---
Dire bear form was in from the start (I think). The bear form armour bonus was changed in patch 1.2, which is pretty early on.
---
From the 1.2 patch notes https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.2.0 :
---
Bear Form: Armor bonus increased from 65% to 180%.
---
Dire Bear Form: Armor bonus increased from 125% to 360%.
---
First aid exists again!
---
Mara is the cancer of classic. Literally my least favourite place in the game lol
---
Keyring is missing.
---
Far from a billion times better. Diablo is more polished and responsive and doesn’t have the ballsy monetisation Path of Exile can annoy you with. They’re both good games but to say it’s a billion times better is wrong, as they both tend to two different audiences of the ARPG crowd.
---
Orc Rogue, Mages have always been a dime a dozen.
---
They might not like the idea of going away from *$60 sales from millions of people every 2 years*
---
To be fair, Warcraft was *never* "Low Fantasy". Classic just was more limited in its design. I mean, look at BC, travel to an alien world with giant mushrooms while fighting space demons. Even vanilla you were fighting dragons, riding airships, soaring on gryphons, etc.
---
But I get what you mean generally about not being a hero, but, Warcraft has never been low fantasy, lol. I do wish more people would go with simpler armour sets in RP though, at the least in the city, on live servers, but that gets into another discussion entirely regarding RP character power creep and people making day 1 archmage-lords.
---
whats with all the boomer memes
---
i dont play BFA but based on the reddit posts i hear about it, it seems to use the same kind of hooking systems as all the gatcha chinese mobile games, but without the p2w whale element. like i used to play a few and they just have all these daily things and loot and everything each day that they pull you in to get on and spend your energy and do their limited diamond-gaining events and what not, spend more and more until you begin to just resent it, but youre still kinda stuck bc you invested so much time/money.    
---
not that dailies havent been a part of wow forever, but just the forcefulness of the need to log in and get everything done. how terrible to imagine thats what wow's like now.
---
[Reminds me of my mug](https://i.imgur.com/kJ8L2ys.jpg)

Devilsaur mafia was a thing back in vanilla, so it's foolish to dismiss it because it's bannable. People still did it, people will do it on live servers.
---
RP-PVP servers were by far my greatest MMO-RPG experience. People tank in /s as though they are in character, however in group chat and guild people talk normally. You don't see people running around as much with regarded names (e.g poopstabber69) and there are frequently world PVP-RP events organised where the opposing factions face off in a war type scenarios. Incredibly good fun.
---
It's true that one mediocre spec wont kill your raid, but many times the bigger issue is that once you allow one meme spec other people start wanting to play meme specs. Pretty soon you have 5 people playing ret paladins, boomkins, ect and it starts to hurt the raid.
---
Also it can create issue with some people that they are trying hard to be optimal for the guild, why should this guy be allowed to play a non optimal spec while 39 other people are expected to 'play what's best for the guild'
---
In casual guilds it doesn't really matter, but most progression guilds won't be taking a boomkin unless you can justify it with the amount of mages benefiting from the aura. Afterall, there is probably going to be an overabundance of mages and warlocks to begin with.
---
I do love all other comments, everyone looks like a clown with no theme. Do they hear themselves? The chances you’ll see full sets on people in classic are so slim. 
---
Transmog is great in retail. I fully understand the argument of how you can tell if someone is a badass pvper in full pvp gear at a glance, in retail it serves nothing as everything gets so scaled down that gear truly doesn’t matter. But to say the game is so much worse because of it is crap, it gave tons of content from going to solo old content which at many stages was challenging if you’re doing previous expansion content. I had most fun in WoD by running old raids and seeing how far i can push them with my wife. If not for transmog? We wouldn’t bother doing it each reset to collect the cool set.
---
People that earn mythic sets of current raids often do wear it, it’s only a problem of too many old sets when people got no current gear they’re proud of getting.
---
Yea! It wouldn't have stung so much if they just had the xp bonus and a green equivalent spec, but they were clearly overtuned. Those level 19 hunters before they added xp in BGs could literally one shot me in full RFC or partial WC gear. The enchants were even OP due to the fact that they never had to be reapplied. The whole system of heirlooms is dumb. Like you said, you can ease your alt journey enough through the resources that you can get on your max character.
---
Pretty much the reason I can't watch Super.  When you start the series off almost destroying the universe while fighting, and then get stronger, how can any of it make sense?
---
I believe RP is still more of a voluntary thing in WoW as opposed to like, EQ RP servers where people were more militant about it.
---
As to how to RP, well that's a question you have to answer yourself. You only have to speak "in a weird middle earth" kind of way if it makes sense for your character.
---
You have to think about who you want your character to be, what is their history, what are their goals and ambitions, why are they fighting, things like that. RP is just getting into the role of your character and saying things and taking actions that align with that role.
---
Well like I said I don't watch him for long but I find absolutely loads of people on his chat insulting him quite heavily for pretty much nothing. Also there are loads of views on 'asmongold raging...' type of videos for people who like to see him mad about something - majority being quite mellow reactions to be honest.
---
It doesn't rip fury tanks at all. Yes it impacts threat and no melee won't do less dps.
---
The blue post is literally talking about 'mob behaviour'. The clip in this post is showing layer-switching. If you can't comprehend that there's a difference, and that one of those examples could be a bug and the other intentional, I'll just assume that you're just another sharding/layering bfa-apologist.
---
This  transmog is up there with lfr
---
That's actually sort of the point I think. There's never been a point where all content was easy, but the game stopped demanding people do anything difficult/time-consuming for their gear, instead rewarding you with mounts and the like for the hard stuff, so that everyone could experience the content.
---
In theory sort of a fine idea, but in practice, you do that mount achievement once, and then you're running daily heroics for the duration of the expansion. They were immediately and easily pug-able, even in questing gear, and so less of a challenge and more of a time-gate, like you see with a lot of the content in the game today.
---
Shitty take here....but I value the enjoyment of a few thousand people trying to enjoy the game in their off-time versus the enjoyment of a "career" gamer who gets paid to play.
---
I hope every one of the big streamer's fans (or haters) find their server(s) and congregate there. Us regular plebs' enjoyment, on a separate server, takes priority to me.
---
he asks the fire mage for conjured food at the end nice
---
Mage. Mages are great in BGs and you can raid and bg woth very similar specs which means less expensive switching for gear farming. While rogues can open doors to dungeons and so forth, that pales in comparison to food, water, buffs and portals. Not to mention they are mean machines in pvp.
---
But if the game is starting fresh with classic then having those cool gear sets will actually mean something and transmog won't be that inaccurate?
---
How is banking being a dick. Sure, it sucks to die while questing but isn't that the point of being in a PVP zone on a PVP server? The excitement of constant threat. Peeking over hills or around trees. Staying off the main path. Meeting a fellow faction member out in the world and keeping an eye on each others back while in the area.
---
You can't. WPL is now scaled for 35-60 on Live.
---
Untill you get a key, working as intended.
---
More than half of the posts here are low quality and shit, riddled with memes and not even good ones. Just like this one. Nothing to cherish.
---
It hardly impacts melee and when you play with correct armor values melee will be even stronger. Problem is just threat now.
---
So it drops different loot for different people?
---
I mean, who dosnt want to be that?
---
No duh but these no changes dumbfucks are getting out of hand with their rabid nonsense
---
You can live without it man, min max is overated. I enjoy looks more then racials.
---
What do you mean by the entitlement being strong with content creators? I'm only aware of his stream and find he himself has little presence anywhere else (that is, asmon making posts, YT videos about himself or his achievements).
---
I agree that scaling is awful, but i wouldn't say its the worst change in modern wow. The LFG feature takes the cake for me. The one thing that single handedly killed the community aspect of the game. Yeah it's easier to find groups now. But now you don't even have to communicate with anyone else in the game.
---
I mean, there's lots of points for playing private servers. You can try out different classes of you're unsure what you want to play, you can experiment with different leveling strategies and routes if you're planning on speed leveling, and if you have a 60 on private server you can be learning the boss encounters and classes mechanics of the end game raids. Now, private servers are not an exact replica of vanilla, but a lot of top end players that will be playing classic still recommend playing them to prepare yourself if you're going to be trying to get into high end competitive guilds. If you don't care about any of that, then there's no point for YOU to play private servers.
---
There is currently not a RP-PVP on release. Blizz has said they might release one if there's enough community interest, but it's not guarantee and it might be something they roll out sometime after release.
---
RP-PVP is not like that, people don't usually walk around doing RP. There's *some* open world RP, but the majority of people don't really interact like that. There's some more strictly enforced rules, like naming conventions (No xxnoobmasterxx), but really it's a pretty normal server. People will break RP to find groups, ask for help, "WTB [Thunderufy, blessed blade of the windseeker]" spam trade, etc. 
---
Where you do find RP is in RP guilds. People will meet up, and have a "DM"-esque narrator like in D&amp;D who plans out an event/story and has their party play along. Sometimes multiple guilds will work together and have huge events, often times it's small group of 3-8 players.
---
If you can get first to 60, AND have herbalism /skinning, start farming devilsaur / grabbing black lotus.
---
I believe those are two of the more "timely" items to capitalize on early before it becomes an absolute mafia shit show.
---
I don t see how BM hunter with reflector can lose to SP.
---
Yea but will other serious pvpers be bothered i dont have escape artist u think?
---
well, he is a bit of an asshole, for example he invited a guy to his guild and promoted him to veteran just because he left a guild right after getting a corrupted ashbringer in vanilla (he sent him a screenshot, he might have also ninjalooted the ashbringer idk). Also a lot of people started to hate him during his dark souls streams when he had a really shitty attitude ( acting really cocky and blaming the game for him fucking up, also he has a really weird stage where he was pretending to be very stupid like he would fuck up on purpose and act very very dumb and stuff it was really obvious).
---
&gt; there are frequently world PVP-RP events organised where the opposing factions face off in a war type scenarios. Incredibly good fun.
---
Thats what Im looking for! I hope they have a RP server.
---
&gt; They didn't do that good of a job ;)
---
Reading that, it does seem to imply that you thought you couldn't do it in vanilla though.
---
I upvoted this last year
---
&gt;Who will be the ONLY raid tanks in Classic? Protection Warriors.
---
Stop spreading misinformation. With the Parry change, Druids will be more viable as tanks, not less. Druids should not be compared to a full mitigation geared prot Warrior. Their countpart is the dualwield furyprot spec.
---
a DW Warrior will suffer a lot more from the increased Parry than a Druid will.
---
Escape artist isn't thattt great for pvp b/c it's a 0.5 second cast.
---
I look at armor as the achievemnts in vanilla. Now you have achievementd and you can look them up. In vanilla i knew which raids you did without having to look it up even. I hate transmog and for me its up there with lfr competing for the wordt addition to the game. I think its beyond stupid that someone in green quest armor can look like they are the biggest motherfucking badass to ever step foot in azeroth.
---
Just talking Bout the first half of your post...i was so fucking floored when they removed the hp/mana pool being affected by stats. FUCK that. Static mana pools? That shit was so stupid and game breaking. I loved being able to roughly estimate gear from mana/hp and watching my own healer mana go up as I get more gear.
---
Depends. If you plan to get into a very good premade, then they will pick a gnome mage over you. This is ofc if it is a hardcore premade. A random pug premade won't really care.
---
It didn't, the user is telling the admin that the system is doing something weird.
---
My little brother had an ugly girlfriend named Megan. My other little brother and I used to call the princess Megan just to piss him off. We they broke up he joined in. It was always hilarious to us to zone into Mara to see how Megan was doing.
---
Opinions
---
Your level 40 mount. Good enough!
---
Ignore the downvotes..people evidently can't read.
---
Farming the devilsaur leather literally gets him two of his boes. The conversation should literally stop right there. Devilsaur leather will only exponentially climb in price as more people hit 60 and warriors / rogues want it. After your base mount, it's devilsaur items for these dps classes.
---
&gt; Yea but will other serious pvpers be bothered i dont have escape artist u think?
---
no.
---
I disagree. With transmog everyone rps as a super badass with all this rare armor. Not to mention how people tend to use the same gear..
---
Oh hey....I was in this guild haha. Timecop was a cool dude, taught me much huntering for my alt.
---
Will try it for sure, but with two smalm kids it will be fairly casual. Maybe I'll have to bother you for a boost at some point :p
---
It destroys the power fantasy.  A big part of that fantasy is looking like an absolute hobo for the majority of your playtime.  When you see someone standing on top of the Org bank, decked out in full T2, you're like "Damn...that looks amazing.  Where did you get all that stuff?".  That's where a lot of raiders are born.  If you want to look badass, then you're going to have to level up, join a guild, be on the raiding schedule, and piece together gear if you really want that look.  Transmogging all your garbage gear into a bright shiny costume eliminates the aesthetic incentive to acquire gear.  The only thing retail does well these days is eliminate any sort of incentive for learning the game, your class, or any mechanics.
---
trollpost. Almost trolling as hard as Blizz, no rp-pvp server at launch in a game that is called WARcraft. 3/7
---
What makes u say no
---
Well that is certainly not intended, but hardly a game changer.
---
Report it!  Reddit cant fix it
---
Why are you arguing with him?  He answered your question, it’s not his decision.
---
Explain?  They want a recreation of the game we fell in love with, and that’s a bad thing?
---
Nah Rouges/Mages and Furys will still be absolutely uncontested
---
Paladin is so dogshit in vanilla if you want to do what a paladin should be capable of. BC really helped fix up all the meme specs like ret, prot, feral etc. But playing a pala in vanilla compared to wrath, you’ll feel like an NPC.
---
In this sub, _any_ shitting on post BC mechanics/features/anything is popular.
---
ret is dogshit in vanilla compared to tbc or wrath
---
don't let people like esfand try to trick you into believing otherwise. it's not viable at all in actual progression environments.
---
So you sent an unsolicited group invite without even greeting them, then stole the mob when it spawned? 
---
If you want cooperation maybe you should try exercising some of the manners that go along with it.
---
/wave "Hey X! I'm on the same question wanna group for it?"
---
They are not exploits. But later (!!) they decided it's not good for the game, and they changed it. Of course I agree with the change, by the way.
---
But the same thought process can be applied to debuff limits. Or to neither. But not one or the other, not unless you can point out a justifiable difference.
---
Of course Blizz will do whatever they feel like, it's not that this argument will change that, but this is mainly for the part of the community that bashes legit suggestions with nochange philosophy, when really they are no different to changes they wouldn't have issues with. But then they'd have to admit that they don't have some moral high ground or whatever, and they're just protecting their own idea of how the game should be, and they'd have to provide actual pro and con arguments.
---
&gt;Yeah, well, it doesn't matter. I have been saying this for ages.Vanilla was, and Classic will be harder than pservers, for a number of reasons, and this blue post add the most important one.
---
I might have believed you, except for that the fact that literally every dungeon and elite mob so far on the Beta has been complete faceroll.
---
Fuck the portal
---
that's why you give power infusion to your worst mage
---
The easiest way to say this without going into detail or a perfect build. Just put all points into frost.
---
Raids are harder in BC, wrath it actually seems is easier raids at least early on, but as for leveling, dungeons QoL stuff is harder in vanilla.
---
It's bad the level of vehemence I see since it's being shown most of those people's memories are faulty. Like of course transmog shouldn't be in classic but saying it's a bad idea in general is just ignorant.
---
You hit the nail on the head. The fact that people think "looking like a clown who can't dress himself" is a problem, in my opinion, is silly. Looking dumb until you get good gear is a right of passage imho. Never liked WoW being a fashin show. I learned a lot from this thread. Seems like the community is divided right down the middle on this one. The classic community leans a bit towards my thoughts, but not as much so as I originally expected. The most adamant are the ones that click into the thread and vote on the comments, and those users seem to be transmog fans, as evidenced by a positive rating on the original post, and negative scores for the exact same sentiment in the comments. It's fascinating to me.
---
common misconception for RP noobs.
---
you don't have to speak old English in RP servers. nobody does that. not even the human NPC's in the game do. you don't see Bolvar Fordragon saying "thee, thy, thou" etc.
---
o' course tha Dwarves tend ta speak like thas. ya've got tae experience it fer yerself lad.
---
basically just speak in character and avoid using modern slang, or terms for game mechanics, etc. but this isn't some Medieval reenactment here. throw in some LOK'TAR's if you're Orc, or some Elune Adorei's if you're Night Elf.

It is factually not bis over 30+.  You should analyze how you reacted to this situation.
---
Wait... could you transmog mounts in retail? I thought it was just gear
---
Not always, depends on the person.
---
OK so first of all I've never played in a rp-pvp realm... I have and currently play in an RP realm though, and I'd guess they're pretty similar. I wouldn't be surprised if rp-pvp was even more lax though.
---
Anyway, you first gotta understand there is two 'stances' when playing your character: IC (in character) and OOC (out of character).
---
Usually if you're leveling, pvping, or just running around jumping in your mount, you're OOC, this means your character won't be taken accountable for the actions you do, and therefore his/her story won't be affected.
---
Then there is IC which is as you so kindly put it, the part where you gotta speak with that weird middle earth accent. This represents your character's actions in the universe.
---
In my experience, people aren't too stressed about anything, unless you start trolling them when they're rping a scene.
---
If you're seriously interested in rping you can find lots of online guides on how to write up your character (sorry you can't be Varian Wrynn) and avoid god-modding or writing a Mary Sue.
---
Alternatively if you just wanna play in that kind of realm and don't care for RP you can totally do that, I know a bunch of people who play on RP realms and have never actually rped. You won't be looked down upon, unless you go around disrupting other people's enjoyment of the game.
---
Inside information....
---
This sub is currently cancer with karma whoring, streamer worship, utterly pointless virtue signalling/feelgood posts and people who use the term “y’all”. 
---
Can’t wait for more serious discussion to be honest.
---
They are slow... like really slow.... No, you don't understand they are slooooow!
---
Jokes aside, the only buttons you will have to press is your seal + judgement + Auto Attack, thats it for most of the leveling. After leveling if you want to raid seriously you have to heal, since prot ain't got a taunt und ret doesn't do enough damage. 
---
TL;DR
---
Tank Only viable in dungeons not raids
---
Ret is "meme" low dps spec
---
Healer is very good in raids, dungeons and pvp and you only serious option
---
Yeah it’s so cool being able to tell how powerful someone is at first glance, oh fuck is that a bloodfang set? I’m gonna die now :)
---
Im against xmog in Classic, but if I had to pick a reason..its shitty itemization of class armor. For example..if I roll Pally ill be in a fucking cloth outfit for a year..that shit is so immersion breaking. How is that AT ALL my class fantasy? Its not. Id rather xmog lvl 40 circus colored plate than stare at my clothadin for that long.
---
Right, but rogue is still the best at it because stealth and vanishing. i wouldn't play classic on a pve server.
---
I consider myself a serious PvPer and I wouldn't be bothered. If you have decent gear and know to play your class, nobody's going to give a shit. Especially since the human racial is pretty good in WSG, you can help spot rogues that try to defend the enemy flag.
---
I couldn't care less, to be honest. My opinion matched that of Preach's very closely. It wasn't for me, but I was happy that the people who wanted it, got it.
---
I had my time in Vanilla. I ran the raids, I attempted the pvp rank grind, I remember the horrible quest drop %s. 
---
I'll say though, the Beta has changed my opinion, same as it did for others. Yeah, none of the above is any less true....but it still feels great to play a game that feels more like a traditional rpg rather than retail's version which feels more like a mobile mmo.
---
&gt;if you feel inclined, activate your sub to be considered for beta.
---
Feels like blizz gonna just keep saying this shit to try bait vanilla fans into paying 15$ a month to have A CHANCE to TEST a BETA
---
wait meele dps stand in front of bosses on pservers???
---
By today's standards, my vanilla guild was casual.    
---
Great leadership &gt; everyone min/maxing.     
---
Our raid leaders didn't tell us how to spec. It was just a common mentality that everyone does their best.     
---
Leadership telling someone what to play because its more optimal creates fractures in the guild's moral. When you spend a month wiping on C'thun, those fractures the have been festering widen and cause the guild to break up. Looks like that guild definitely isn't killing that hard boss now.
---
That's awesome mate. Was a great read thanks for sharing. I havn't had depression but WoW classic has brought back friends I have barely spoken to in the last 10 years, and I think that is one thing that WoW can do that no other game can - give you true friendships and companions. I hope on August 27 we both make a bunch of new ones to start this journey with all over again!
---
I think that's why I ended up liking Cata so much even though everyone hated it: it brought the world back. Yes, it also brought flying in every zone and other mistakes, but at least the 1-60 world was relevant and felt huge again (plus the capitals were the main hub again).
---
And it is probably one of the reason battle royales are so popular.
---
If you go through the lore, both sides are good, bad, victims, and heros.
---
Ah that was it. Either way it was a significant chance
---
Yes you could, first time in deadmines was a 10 man.
---
I will create as many characters named Drizzt on as many servers as possible and then let them rot never once been played.
---
As someone who had no interest in end game content and just liked leveling, Cata was awesome. A lot of people complain that the quest markers made everything too easy because you didn’t have to read the actual quests, but in TBC (and WOTLK, I don’t remember when that feature was added) people just used leveling guides or addons to streamline the leveling process anyway.
---
So awesome.  U have a new friend now :)

Warhammer Chaosbane launches next week on June 4th. It is online arpg looking similiar to D3, but in the Warhammer universe. It looks promising, 50 bucks though.
---
Also PoE new leage lands next Friday, which will fill the gap untill Classic launches.
---
The later games turned into a dungeon grind and that gets boring. The idea that classic is better or harder than even cata is laughable. But it definitely peaked in cata then pandas tore down a great game.
---
I mention it in a different post, but in general i am against tmog. However, I can see the argument for it when it comes to classes like Paladins and Shamans, who are relegated to wearing cloth in 75% of their slots until Naxx. Its really really lore breaking and immersion breaking to see that shit. Im a paladin, not a priest, yet due to shitty itemization I have no choice but to wear cloth.
---
Read the entire OP and you'll understand why I made that comment with a smile. It's not hard.
---
&gt;Private servers use generic values instead of specifics for each boss but the question is, are these generic values higher or lower.
---
In every case where we DO happen to know the correct armor, the pserver bosses have much much more armor. It might not be the case across every boss, but thats the data we have.
---
Allakazham\*
---
BC is cool, Vanilla is Gold.
---
Are you kidding me? How disingenuous do you have to be to say that the quest takes 40-60 minutes? The SFK portion alone will take at least an hour, even if you're able to find a group instantly.
---
Going from Stormwind, to Westfall, back to Stormwind, to Ironforge, to the Deadmines, to BFD, to the elite ogres in Loch Modan, to SFK, then back to Ironforge.
---
All of this traveling by itself will take at least an hour or two. And you're trying to claim that the entire quest line takes 40-60 minutes. Completely ridiculous.
---
&gt;Was vanilla that much better than BC and Wotlk ?
---
It's not subjective it also doesn't matter how much you play. Less than 3% is still less than 3%.
---
No, it's not gonna be downhill.
---
I think the museum piece is the exact opposite of what this means.
---
A museum piece wouldn't have safety or anti-cruelty regulations applied to historical weapons.
---
Not everything but most things. /sit macros, incorrect numbers, incorrect AI, etc etc. It's basically a completely different game under the hood. I think A LOT of things regarding the meta will change.
---
&gt; It means that there will be no Druid
---
No it absolutely does not mean this lmao. It means the exact opposite. Druids will be the preferred tank for bosses where a high threat ceiling is necessary, because the private server alternative for these bosses is to have your tank dualwield without using a shield.
---
Some classes _never_ look awesome lol. Paladins with have to wear 90% cloth and leather until naxx. Its kinda shitty to play a Pally with their class fantasy only for in game to ruin it. Im against tmog in classic, but I can see the argument
---
https://imgur.com/a/t3vviWU
---
This is also occurring on regular mobs as well.  In Mulgore I am seeing this happen but much more rarely than 50%. It seems like the higher leveled the mobs get, the less likely I am to NOT be able to skin them.
---
I always wondered why Warriors are the DPS kings on pservers but although they were great in vanilla, I don't recall them excelling so far ahead. I just figure that the game knowledge/experience is what made them better class and most just never achieved the full potential back in vanilla, however this info might prove otherwise.
---
Perhaps classic will bring Warrior more in line with the other Classes for classic which will better reflect what we remember from vanilla.
---
This has been tradition since 2004.
---
Horde like Dwarves
---
Alliance like Taurens
---
Ah that was it. Either way it was a significant change
---
You know nothing Jo ... nevermind !
---
&gt;14% parry vs 5.6% means A LOT more than 8.4% less threat for tank. It means that there will be no Druid and Fury Warr tanks, which means longer fights
---
Considering how we now know Classic is across the board easier in terms of how much damage everything does then no, the Parry thing does not mean this at all.
---
And Server specific forums
---
What does a server first get you? 
---
Besides... There would be more STREAM SNIPERS then people helping them. Roll PvP and watch them get melted.
---
Use the console command to max nameplate distance to 100, see them a mile away, profit.
---
I was a very mobile hunter and my main priority was distance. So for me I used a hyena a lot. Their hamstring slowed people down something like 50% for 5 seconds iirc. Great for most scenarios. I was a flag returning machine in wsg too and hamstring helped quite a bit with efc.
---
Wrong! I have 2 Keys and its not showing up!
---
&gt;If armor values are higher on classic compare to private servers
---
Armor is higher on private servers in every case where we can prove the correct armor from the Vanilla version of the boss.
---
With the level of phasing, Retail honestly doesn’t even seem more mmo-like than looter shooters (Destiny, Division, etc)

Well yeah, but it saves a bag slot. So that's something. Especially when you're already using bag space on soul shards.
---
Yea probably. I wouldn't pay it if money is tight, even in the next wave the majority won't get in.
---
I wouldn't mind a transmog system that only unlocked pieces of gear to use if you passed a few requirements, character bound and had to be earned within a time frame where it was considered "current" Not for classic of course but it would add back that sense of awe seeing a mythic raider or elite PVP'er
---
Were you level capped and still doing quests? If so, all the XP that you would normally get is converted into gold instead.
---
It was like this as well last week when the level cap was 5. I continued doing quests after reaching the cap and just made a bunch of gold .
---
Doesn't this suggest bear tanks become relatively better, because a warrior won't be able to actively mitigate all of these extra parry-haste hits, and bears have more armour.
---
And also the parry-haste is unpredictable, and bears have more health, so have more of a buffer for healers to react.
---
I'm not saying this makes bears *better* than warriors, but that it makes the gap between them smaller.

That's the main drawback, druid burst threat is unreliable and dps will have to wait a few seconds sometimes. Once the first few seconds are passed druids shouldn't have threat problem tho.

wrong, PoE is objectively better.
---
&gt; What does this 14% raid boss parry chance means is simple : Fights will last longer because ONLY PROTECTION WARRIORS will tank raid bosses
---
All the theorycrafters (based on pserver information) prior to this agreed that prot warriors are the only option for tanking raids. Most claimed that druids can tank 5 mans and could potentially be solid off-tanks.
---
&gt;Hopefully, this Blue Post settles the discussion on which was harder : private servers or Vanilla. Because it is crystal clear that it was Vanilla.
---
I don't think it's fair to say it's crystal clear. We still don't know that much about raiding in Classic, even though it looks like it's gonna be harder.
---
Most of mine were my 19 twink teabagging another known 19 twink.
---
It let us EU folks try and get in during the fuckfest at the start without staying up till 2am too (though I still stayed up to keep playing once I got in!)
---
1. 40man raids will have paladins for each of those blessings.
---
2. Look at salvation as a 30% dps increase buff. It just raises the threat ceiling allowing you to push more deepz.
---
its in classic wow even, you can do it for party too. no add-on's required.
---
Drop rates being higher means you get more quest drops with fewer kills.
---
Fewer kills means less loot and less money.
---
How is this so difficult to understand? We are talking about quest drops affecting how many mobs you need to kill, not drop rates for cash and junk loot. Follow along.
---
As for evidence plenty have talked about this very thing when they noticed they get more money and level faster in Classic than on Pservers because you are forced to kill more mobs on Classic due to lower drop rates.
---
More mobs, more XP, more cash, more junk to sell thanks to lower quest drop rates.
---
IN vanilla you had skills, and magic skills. and stats,
---
When you level, some of those raised, some of them increased their cap.
---
In the two screenshots you see that your strength went up by 1, which raises your attack power.
---
On level up magic skills like Restoration, automatically gained 5 points.
---
Weapon and defense skills cap was raised 5 points for you to level.
---
Having these skills higher had an effect.
---
It's coming.
---
August 27th, 2019.
---
Again, not a bug. It's a FEATURE
---
I love how people say the time running to SFK is wasted then recommend trying for drops from dungeons on another continent.
---
When I have more time I’ll dig some stuff up and send it your way.
---
I'm not a fury tank specialist but from what i understand the point of going dualwield is to hit more often to generate more rage (and also because it does more dps so more tps than 2h). 
---
Maybe 2h tank will be the way to go if dualwield take too much damage because of parry haste.
---
this sub is at the bottom, 90% of threads are "streamer X just opened his mouth, lets make a 10 min video on it" or "WHAT CLASS SHOULD I PLAY????????????"
---
Healing paladin is pretty similar, but anything related to ret or prot is completely shit.
---
Seems to me that this is exactly why we would want testers to get a level increase; to find more things like this.
---
STACK FIRE RESIST
---
umm, you know gaining strength from leveling is literally increasing your attack power right?
---
Like the buff itself doesn't show an increase of attack power right?
---
If you have a screenshot of the buff itself showing an increase that would be incorrect but you're showing me your stat screen.
---
That's why he asked for emails and bnet tag. He just miss-spoke because we are old and used to getting into betas via code.

---
No problem man, I'm just tired of all the purity testing regarding when people played that goes around on this subreddit. And I hope that other people who read this go out of their way to call out shit like that in the future, the community is what makes vanilla so great, and right now our community here kinda of sucks.
---
Classic is currently in closed beta. You won't be able to play it now. I can't say whether starting with classic or current would be better for you although I still think WOW is a great game and I would say it is well worth experiencing. Just download and run for the free trial and the decide if you like it enough to subscribe.
---
&gt; I played Holy Pally / Destro Lock in TBC
---
Now THAT is a hybrid class lol
---
The cone of light wasn't until Cataclysm.
---
Where di you read it came out in a patch that doesn't exist?
---
Yes it's in classic, it comes out with AV in phase 3.
---
Yes it’s just my opinion, point I was making is that it was an extremely popular one, if not the most popular of any ‘feature’ in wow.
---
Funny thing is that there’s probably a decent amount of people that are going to use model changers to look like Illidan or something haha.
---
Hunter can be very good in PvP. You just need to know what you're doing.
---
I love completing quests, but that's one what chain that I will always abandon before giving up the rod.
---
If the two crowds are people who like an interesting game and people who like to be bored after 10 minutes of playing then yes. They are for two different crowds.
---
Thank you.  This is exactly want I needed to hear.
---
same lol
---
They will be running 1.12, pretty sure that came in pretbc
---
Wrong. Majority of these comments are in favor of transmog. You're not as far in the "right" here as you'd like to believe.
---
Transmogs water down power-fantasy. True.
---
Transmogs also empower players to customize their look in a ROLE-PLAYING GAME. Undeniably true.
---
Pretty nuanced discussion here bud, so quit the low-brow crap.
---
Wrath was peak because of storyline. In fact Wrath is the expansion that introduced most of the changes that made us ask for classic. 
---
Ever heard of the expression wrath babies? Yep I belive they are the ones wearing nostalgia goggles.
---
You know that a gaming industry is in a huge crisis if the best we can expect is a re-release of a 15year old mmorpg and remastered versions of games released 17years ago. Well Cyberpunk 2077 will be awesome for sure.
---
I cant wait to get my hands on Classic WoW. Unsubbed from retail half a year ago and there is not a single game i wanna play even tho i have to somewhat use the time while waiting for august 27th.
---
I assumed that when the admin asked 'did you report it so it could record logs' that the user would have a prompt.  I suppose they could have a toggleable 'record logs' or another way of allowing the user to detail when logs are captured however.
---
Yes they are quite good.
---
Aimed shot does have a long cast time which is why you pretty much only use it after trapping a player. Trap into aimedshot auto multishot is a devastating combo. Hunters do very well in 1v1's aswell.
---
“Hitting a level and being eligible to start questing in that next zone is a reward. I love questing in west fall but you bet your ass when I hit 18(maybe 19) I’m going to duskwood. Because I earned the right to go there.”
---
You can still do that, scaling did nothing to change that. Only difference is that now people can continue to stay in a zone they started and keep playing it, instead of thinking ‘man I only did half of this area, I wish I could have finished this entire zone’. Scaling also didn’t lower the level requirement for (most) zones, so you still need to wait until 19 to get quests in Duskwood.
---
“Plus when I hit 60 and go back through these zones I want to demolish the stuff like it once did to me”.
---
You can still do this as well. Zones only scale up to a certain level, and this is what the cap is for vanilla zones.
---
Yes it will.
---
The game had also changed a lot by that point too. 
---
In vanilla, the gear you wear was a status symbol. The gear you had was your raider.io score.
---
These days, even if you removed transmog, you'd have no way to tell if someone was well geared or not just by looking at their character. 
---
Take an average well geared character at the moment. They are likely using some of the raid items, but they're also likely using some M+ pieces, at least in the case of Helm, Shoulders, and Chest - which are arguably the most visually notable parts aside from weapons.
---
Transmog makes complete sense in live wow because how your gear looks doesn't represent it's power, and there's so many potential sources of decent gear that it's just not a big deal now a days.
---
I'd love for vanilla to have some minor form of transmogging though. I want to be able to use a cool looking enchant rather than the one that is necessarily the best, and also make minor tweaks to my character's appearance. I do enjoy it on live, and I am looking forward to them further loosening the restrictions on live. 
---
The problem of course, if nothing else is for PvP and world PvP. It's good being able to look at someone out in the world and just know immediately how well geared they are. We can't see their health pool in vanilla - how else do you gauge how well geared someone is? (before you're already getting hit and seeing their damage numbers)
---
I'd love to have some sort of outfit slot that maybe only worked in non-PvP flagged areas though and wouldn't be against something like that, if done right.
---
But then, I'm also not one of those people that has been completely #nochanges. I personally want to see Classic eventually evolve off on it's own path, divergent from how the game originally went.
---
Trasmog is one of those things that I think is just fine for retail, but would never ever want to see in classic
---
Everything was cringe at that time
---
Yeah it was awesome until we wiped.

Looked like a map marker that people leave to show that an areas not done. It's big enough to spot on an upper level and easy to filter by a product code by using a clear marker. Less of a bug and more of a massive marker to show it's still not done.

Well youre wrong mate. I remember in 2005 seeing people running with it.

no BC is best ever
---
They’re very strong in pvp.
---
well, right now ppl from stress test realms are getting cross matched in bgs with the guys from beta
---
Your aimed shot isn't something you are doing a lot in a 1vs1. It's not relevant at all to their pvp power.
---
Cata turned the game into a brainless exclamation mark simulator. Classic WoW is partly guilty of this too, but at least it required a lot of running around or effort.
---
Cata is just disgusting in its execution of hub leveling.
---
feel ya...
---
The only quest in Deathknell where you need to grind for drops is the Scarlet Armbands quest. Everything else is a guaranteed drop or you just kill shit or pick it up off the ground. If you think a lower droprate will make a difference of 80s on a level five quest you are simply delusional.

Myself and a friend both rolled warlocks. He got the 3 skulls needed for the imp off the first 3 rattlecage we killed.
---
It took me 16 rattlecage.
---
Your experience with drops isn't everyone's. RNG is a thing. Because my friend made out and I didn't doesn't mean the drop rates were higher.
---
Maybe they're the best at getting really close to you without being seen but I've used the terrain to easily get just as good of a jump. Also any player worth their salt is going to tag a rogue with a dot preventing the vanish. In a fight with 2 bad players sure the rogues gonna probably win but a good player can always turn the tide against a decent/good rogue

I definitely see an increase in a friendly player base. I was trying to continue from level 5 last night and through all the competition between mobs a mage stopped to save me from one too many I pulled. He then gave me mana food and ran off. 
---
We ended up grouping up and chatting for a bit until he had to go offline. Turns out he’s from a completely different country too and I’ve haven’t felt that sort of sense in community for a long time.
---
Tens years of this kind of comment got us to BFA.
---
Yeah it seems clear that those are pretty poor points of reference given that completely different teams work on those things
---
Farming a potential extra 10g an hour doesn't matter if you're just going to dump it all back into engineering because you don't have its associated gathering profession.
---
AFAIK they used cast animation to determine which spell is being casted, so that's the reason these addons were and are far from accurate.
---
&gt; in Classic/vanilla it's quite rare
---
Based on? If it's using spell hit you should see resists frequently on mobs just a few levels higher than you
---
If you want to raid you'll be healing as holy. You won't have beacon (which was one of the best parts about healing as pally in wrath imo), half your time will be spent casting one of three ranks of holy light,the other half will be refreshing blessings which only last 15 minutes.
---
You also get a cool mount.
---
We had cross realm BGs in the end of vanilla though, didn't we? I don't think that only came in TBC, right?

---
I started in end of BC (like a month before WotLK release) and I'm excited for this too. But I am not sure how much better Vanilla would have been compared but I do understand that classes were a lot more assigned to certain roles or such? I am more excited cause the game may actually have a chance of going to a PvP-centric style rather than the lame excuse that BfA was. World PvP and the actual adventure of getting level capped were what originally got me into WoW. The game will actually go back to being sociable where you can't do LFG for everything.

Cata was actually the first expansion that empowered players and it created strong and fun raids. It was amazing.

Getting to RFK or BFD is so much faster than SFK. Nobody on Alliance does SFK for this reason. It's a waste of time trying to form a group for it. It will take hours.

I guess that's what they're playing this... MSORPG? Oh, wait, no, it's a multiplayer game for a reason.

Hunters are easy to do very good with. 
---
Hard to master, they have the highest skillcap along witg mages.

Yes they do : to all the healers that let them die :D

Wow... The initial comments in this thread truly show how little the most vocal people know. Report the bug??? Lol?

Nearly doubling up on parry hasting is a pretty big blow to the fury tank meta.

---
I saw this picture and a comment saying this is gonna be a meme. I'm glad it's been used for good instead of evil.
---
I'm actually not going to compare vanilla to any of the expansions, because they really do feel like totally different games. Instead I will describe how Vanilla feels. Because there are very few instant gratification mechanics, you have to work for a reward. The world is dangerous, immersive and actions have consequences. You can make a name for yourself and people remember you. You will recognise people for various different reasons and the world, feels like a true living environment. Not something that is forced upon you.
---
I would say rogue if you like pvp that much. A well played rogue can pretty much only be beaten by a tauren warrior. We don't know the lesser played one yet, and won't until the game launches.
---
Lmao I got so many downvotes for mentioning bfa, sorry for the tip
---
They're good, but they do require a lot of practice, skill, and situational awareness. Shadow Priests, Warlocks, and smart Frost Mages will probably always beat you if geared equally.
---
Pally buff blessing of salvation.
---
Just means you cause less threat when you have the buff, and warlocks and warriors have issues with threat so salv really helps them
---
Wasnt J. Allen Brack one of the reasons Star Wars Galaxys went downhill?

not if theres no shaman in their group they dont

LOL... no dude.
---
People aren't face-rolling raid encounters on p-servers because tanks are getting parry haste hit 6% less often, or because fights take slightly less time thanks to higher melee DPS.
---
People are face-rolling raid encounters because the mechanics are *easy as shit* compared to modern WoW.  People just don't stand in fires as much.
---
If anything, this will just change the meta to favor casters more since they are less affected by this "nurf" in classic compared to p-servers.  You won't see 40 man raids with 15 warriors in them like you do with a lot of p-server speed run comps.
---
They already had transmits before bfa. It's an rpg it should be function over fashion.
---

The alt can't DE your quest items. So you'll be stuck with a mining profession too low to mine the ore for the zones you're in and you'll still have to go back and farm the earlier nodes to get enough for engineering. There's really no loss by dropping mining and picking it back up again at 60.
---
Yeah but you should be able to vendor the meat right? I distinctly remember fucking up and vendoring quest items back in the day.
---
Depends if you’re doing PvP or pve. The boar is great for PvP cat for pve

I'm just glad that somone actually uses this subreddit in order to help fix issues / start discussions.

I think cross realm bgs arrived somewhere during tbc, but i don't remember exactly when. I don't think it was in vanilla though
---
It’s not the bit that makes it valuable it’s the reduction of the glancing blow damage penalty.

Yes, those damn betrayers.

I wonder if they got into the beta as content creators and that's why we haven't had anymore.
---
Function over X is a slippery path.

They will both be viable - even dual wielding warrior tanking is only made slightly more difficult by this change.
---
What do you mean with "empowered players"?
---
What? Of course they're going to increase it at some point. All this stuff that is unfinished is going to need testing. Does this guy think they're going to just shit the game out without testing most of, y'know, the game..?
---
I thought I recalled something about the last 1% being unchangeable. With taunt at least, hit wouldn't reduce the miss chance below 1%.
---
Hahaha, totally agree
---
BC is better. Wotlk had some great aspects but also really started down the path of damaging the game significantly.
---
Earlier than that. Wowhead was created in 1.11 so any add patch in wowhead will be 1.11 at the earliest.

One missing model? That's it? Get real dude. That is insignificant in the grand scheme of things needed.

Right, but the pre-patch system is more relevant. An addon can't recreate Meeting Stones / Innkeepers. It can and will recreate the old pre-Patch interface, and be even better than it.

---
Anyone else think hitboxes are a bit huge? Seems i can attack mobs and they can attack me from large distance
---
If it crashes entirely, sure, and there's and exception to catch. Bugs like "this value is a bit off" that are programming errors won't be caught by the program since it's running correctly (but is incorrectly constructed).
---
So the classic client crashing to desktop will likely have been noticed by the client, but an equipped sword going on backwards won't.
---
That's right. I should have emphasized that there's no point for me. I just played a lot on other addons and tried to get the best equipment. But now i consider classic not as a competition of getting BiS and first kills, but as a returning to quiet leveling and getting pleasure from being a tiny part of the big dangerous world
---
&gt;on mobs just a few levels higher than you
---
You do realize FD + Freezing Trap is a macro used for PvP? You shouldn't ever run into a player who can resist it once you are lvl 60.
---
welcome to the deadmines , mysteries in the deadmines
---
Transmog isn't the worst addition.
---
What's the actual worst addition is really nice sets being "earned" after the content became irrelevant/soloable.
---
Imagine if you could only transmog/earn appearances while the content was current.
---
And don't forget about the GCD as well! With normal mounts you can instantly start mounting after an ability, whereas on the classmount you have to wait for the GDC to finish. Not a big deal but for me that's a bit annoying
---
Cata was horrible. It was the first bad expansion.
---
if they do additional content for classic (which i doubt) they might do some shenanigans with the corrupted Ashbringer. maybe a questchain that ends in a raid to cleanse the ashbringer (akin to what you do with atiesh)
---
Are u kidding me? Blizzard even said in a bluepost, that there won't be any more or not many Beta Keys/Access as they ready habe enough people to test the beta. that means they don't want people to sub just for a beta access to not dissapoint them.
---
Now, some random guy on this earth claims to have inside information and u believe in it or atleast claim Blizzard baits subs.
---
I mean, they did, so...

No matter what kind of server i go on i fully plan to RP for the first time. Speaking in /s and talking to people. Can't effing wait.
---
But you have to have completed the content to get that armor. So they are a "badass" on their main. Or they have old armor sets and most players know what's current tier sets and what's old.
---
From the streams, when you get out of the bg, you end up were you accepted the queue, like retail.
---
Lol who's seriously going to use this sub after Classic launches? What for? We're going to have friends and guilds to talk to. Can't imagine wanting to argue about layering or streamers or bad specs or post-naxx when I could be playing the game.
---
Is ghost-cheesing past the doors to Scholomance and Stratholme without a key not an exploit? It's more of an exploit if you ask me, but it's not going to get fixed. What is more, if it were fixed, I'm sure there would be an uproar, because "that's the way it was".
---
Why is the API different?
---
Blizzard even has a tip that says Blizzard employees will never ask for your log in info. So I wouldn’t even give it to blizzard support.
---
Overwatch?
---
Its a fantastic game. Even if it teetered out.
---
Transmog is a great idea and belongs in a game that isn't RPG.   
---
World of Warcraft is an RPG MMO. Or rather, it is supposed to be. So it does not belong.
---
It is that simple.
---
Oof
---
Does Trinket exist in WoW Classic?
---
Where can I buy this? I need it.
---
Things like 10man raids. 10man raids put difficulty back into the discussion and allowed players to have the full experience with an even harder difficulty. A big 25man raid team didn't suit everyone and it didn't have to.
---
If they ever speak of going into a dungeon, another player, a specific zone, or just doing anything specific people will find out. There's no way over weeks and weeks of playing they won't accidentally do one of these things. Also like other people are saying, the fact that they would miss out on day one views for this is silly. They would probably just create an alt char they get to 60 first and then level their main in private if they want to do this. That way they have their "This is for stream" and this is for "Me time". Even then that would eventually get found out.
---
Aimed shot is 3.5 sec cast time by the way. Tooltip is wrong.
---
 Basically my concern is, what does it look like when people “beat” the game? 
---
The same as any other MMORPG. After that and what you described, it's just a matter of flaunting pride a bit and hanging out. Maybe even moving on to another game.
---
It's all about timing as well as knowing who you're fighting, what to use and when to use it. But I always used aimed shot in pvp.
---
&gt;And this 14% parry from boss is actually really hurting main pserv dps that were melees, especially warriors.
---
It only hurts tanks, melee DPS do it from behind ;-)
---
The vast majority of mounts should have been locked to their expansion.
---
Dungeon finder was before bfa too man.... your out of touch.
---
I'm glad we're having discussion too of course. Just sharing that misinformation is a reality
---
Do they have dynamic respawns in NDale?  I've been playing alliance and it seems like mobs spawn so quick..wondering how closely classic will mimic this
---
This is what will mark Expansion servers that are a possible future.
---
Yeah, I was getting the elementals mixed up. It was Blackrock Depths and several of those bosses.
---
Like 2004 out of touch? Looks like classic is perfect for me 😎
---
It really does feel like that. At 14 years of age WoW is all I played. Here I am 28 and am stupid excited to once again jump back into that world. It's interesting to now be the adult and will be running into kids out in the world playing WoW maybe for the first time. It's so amazing.
---
Wish I had the time to check out EVE. I read stories like this all the time. Then you hear stories about mis-clicks leading to massive battles that last days, crash servers and results in millions (billions?) of in game currency, which I think I saw was equivalent to like thousands of real world currency.
---
Heard a news story where a political lobbyist in real life was perma banned in game for fraud and insider trading as he held some in game, elected position. Honestly I can't believe that's even a thing- all of it, haha!
---
Characters weren’t deleted so maybe he logged on his from last test and had some extra silvers from a quest or two turned in at 5 during last stress test.
---
I assumed that when the poster was referring to his times working in automation, and asked 'did you report it so it could record logs' that the user would have a prompt. I suppose they could have a toggleable 'record logs' or another way of allowing the user to detail when logs are captured however.
---
But you are correct, faulty business/domain logic would not necessarily appear in any logging.
---
&gt; Meaning it’s not fact, it’s opinion.
---
You serious bro? He has stacks of moldy dishes at all times, moldy cups everywhere with God knows what inside them. How is it an opinion?
---
And the release of classic is gonna make his first full year as CEO look stellar - almost as if he planned it. People who rag on him/blizzard for what he said are more than happy to fork over 180 dollars a months for a game they developed and released 15 years ago.
---
Classic is the ultimate rerelease model. Change nothing, charge through the nose for it.
---
It really sucked to finish this and then have the goblin bug out and not open the door. It still haunts me to this day.
---
Perhaps some Classic-oriented dungeons/raids. maybe BC, who knows.
---
Best way is for blizzard to figure it out is to come up with a bunch of good ideas and let the community vote. Classic can go any numbers of ways, but if it stays Classic forever there'll still be a cult following always playing it.
---
Speed runs, gear out alts for each pop bracket, flesh out gear sets you always wanted, roll a new char and do it again, or maybe just move on with your life. It's okay for a game to not last forever, there's still plenty of content in WoW. In a way the fact that a person can leave and then a year later come back to the same game is a nice thing, it takes a ton of pressure off you when playing. Now you know the content will always be there, you don't have to play it in this one exact patch or it'll be obsolete forever.
---
&gt;what does it look like when people “beat” the game?
---

I'm curious to see how these changes to parry / dodge AND the often custom resist/armor valued will evolve the meta. Also curious what will happen to emulation later on, we might see "blizzlike, but super tryhard mode" servers.
---
That's called stream sniping and the streams get temporary bans for doing it.
---
I would if I don’t have a choice due to numbers, but if you think I’m bringing your borderline useless hybrid over a real warrior tank, another mage or fury warrior you are out of your mind. 
---
For healers, I bring the minimum amount required for full buffs of paladins and druids. Rest of spots filled with priests.
---
Loot council stance on hybrids? Back of the line, you getting a piece of loot will not help our guild progress/clear content faster.  
---
If you make a choice to play a hybrid, that is all good. Just don’t expect people to want you in their group, you are pretty much deadweight, unless your GG geared and talented.
---
there most definitely wasnt and there wont be
---
It's meant to be 400ms in Classic.
---
Especially if you happen to watch Esfand's stream after Asmon stops. Sometimes Zack/Asmon will still be playing, just not streaming, and chatting with Esfand on Discord. He sounds so chill/relaxed that everyone thinks he's stoned or on meds.
---
But nope, he's just not acting up his stream persona. He seems like a very laid back dude off-stream.
---
There wasn't.
---
No
---
That's a negative ghost rider.
---
I played RP-PVP back in the day and I'm not an RPer... just sort of ended up there I suppose.  Of course I followed the rules as to not upset anyone else but, here's how it worked for me/my guild... /g, /r, /1, was all out of character.  /g seemed to be on a guild by guild basis, however we felt it easier to just be out of character when clearing end game.
---
In practice... It's not about talking like you're from middle earth.  It's talking as though you are your character, their wants &amp; needs, not the person behind the keyboard.  
---
So whilst it might be totally fine to say something like, "I've been killing these guys for five hours and still haven't found that wand", you'd never call it a "drop" and you'd definitely never say "on my last server it dropped first time"  
---
You don't have to say "Farewell-ye-friends, for I must retire to my abode", you can just say "I'm tired and need to sleep", but you'd never say "I'm getting GF aggro, gotta go!"  It's honestly a pretty small adjustment.  I think it helps immersion once you get to grips with it... and honestly people were pretty forgiving as I adjusted to the rules... 
---
Best part about RP servers for me, was nobody called XxOrcHunterxX.
---
Yeah it just came across as baiting for people's account info. Hope you're right though
---
Eh except for wonky math and calculations. Like 9% hit rate but you get 3% hit from 305 weapon skill. Complete reduction of glancing blow penalty. And higher drop rate of quest items.
---
Yeah but it's not a pun like mine.
---
no because you won't buy wow classic at retail. it's included with your retail sub..
---
omg i cant wait to play this again fuckkkkkkk
---
Will AV items be availible with honor points or reputation?
---
That one looks like a pretty bad copy. Why is it missing spaces in the specs?
---
Yep. I was so hyped for that game I bought the collectors edition which I still have.
---
Well, you'd think if they are so smart and doing things to actually open up the game, then the player count would increase. However, the exact opposite has happened. The numbers have steadily dropped since the launch of the Cataclysm expansion in 2010, which "coincidentally" it's the first bad expansion according to most "stupid reddit people".
---
Healing ability under 40 is not really paramount. You can heal just fine as shadow up until high 50s and have superior farming/leveling ability. 
---
An example: I solo’d the Arathi Pirate gauntlet and surrounding quests (engaging in packs of 3 equal level mobs at a time) as shadow. Doable as holy? Possibly, but definitely not as efficient.
---
Do it again on a new character obvs
---
Reddit memes are just left over 4chan memes
---
This sub hits its peak before the beta announcement. It went to shit when beta opened for streamers...
---
" That's when the whores come in...  Men laying their trick-money down. Twenty dollars to pay the rent? Maybe not. Maybe instead I'll spend it on the whore...  Whores running around, doing their little behind-shake for the men folk."
---
I saw soda fly over this on an FP a few days ago
---
It changes the threat cap. All dps must respect the threat cap, no matter their potential. Salvation lowers the dps threat output, but Windfury raises the cap. It changes a lot.
---
Hi, /u/iantnotes, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
In PvP being able to control what your enemy knows is often advantageous, and bats don't have prowl. 
---
Besides, what else would you need the slot for?
---
Vanilla private servers have existed since TBC, many people on these servers have cleared all content and still find entertainment in the game. The future of Classic is currently uncertain. If it holds a good reception Blizzard might consider advancing on it.
---
This sounds a bit like min-maxing
---
While I agree transmogs should not be possible in classic, I'll miss them. I enjoy wearing gear that looks great.
---
So introduce plate armor sets with fitting stats and not transmog.
---
People did 40 man raids of lower dungeons before the 10 man cap was pushed.
---
Good Q, I was thinking the same thing. I remember 2H tanking some farm content back in the day for giggles.
---
I think overall viability will be poorer because you aren't getting imp dual wield. Also, no sitting to proc enrage is a big deal relative to private servers.
---
Ah alright, disregard what I said previously
---
mage
---
&gt;STV will be completely different to what it was. Streamers, even if they only have like 5-6 of his spectators around, can easily shut down STV for any opposing faction member at any time.
---
This is exactly what you're saying though. Streamers or not gank fests will happen in STV. We don't know how many servers blizzard will release but there are only so many well known streamers(Most will likely play on the same servers) who will actually have a big enough following to have an impact.
---
Because the alternative to temporary layering is along the lines of 6 hour queue's with server crashes and 1000 other people in your zone competing for same mobs for the first month or so many servers that you are likely playing on a dead realm after 3 months and have to wait for realm merges and then deal with the hassle that comes from it like losing character and guild names, messing with the server economy, dealing with which servers get merged with which ones etc.
---
I'm well aware of the advantages of terrain and how to use it to sneak up on somebody. i cant sneak a squad or a warband of players up on a zerg and crush them in  prettymuch every open world pvp game to date. I still stand by my statement. if you want to just be annoying or gank, play a rogue. you can sap people just for no reason, just to waste their time, wait till there on super low heath from a  double pull or sitting and gank them. the options are endless.
---
There is no consensus. It's best just to give us Classic and let us play it until everyone gets bored and leaves.
---
People can play whatever content they want retail OR classic. Saying somebody is playing for the wrong reasons... just silly. 
---
What people choose to do with their time is up to them. As long as they do their job in group content and don't negatively impact the dynamic of the game's multiplayer origins there is no issue to me.
---
There wasn't, and I hope there won't be. Achievements were all about screenshots back then, and otherwise living(and likely wearing or having) the experience of achieving your goals as opposed to being given a shiny badge.
---
I'm not sure why you kids are expecting the mid 30's dudes to just accept your stream-watching fetish without mocking you.  The next oldest generation has always mocked the one below them, for one reason or another.  It's the circle of life.
---
Some people couldn't take the challenge of BC difficulty combined with complicated classes. Your not alone there was a lot of push back that blizzard went back to its roots.
---
Forgot about prowl.
---
Not sure. I was going for 1 PvP, one PvE/grinding and 1 slot clear for Pokemon/Red Mage "gotta learn em all" ability hunting. Once done I'd probably get a flavour pet that /I/ like rather than what offers peak performance for it's role.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSrf8EgSyDg
---
New attack table confirmations have huge implications on tank threat and survivability, which then impacts gearing and threat again. 
---
I guess we're still in a "wait and see" phase.
---
I actually only know so much as up to Goldshire which i heard was the go to sexual RP location. I actually got banned for a day because i wanted to rp and when i got to goldshire I said "What's wrong with you people"
---
If it’s a boss for a quest sure. If it’s a normal mob I’ve worked down and you want to leech my xp and/or loot. I kill it and accept. I also generally don’t group up for no shared drop quests cause yeah that’s a waste.
---
Well, then let's not use that analogy. The phrasing doesn't matter.
---
Classic is bringing back Vanilla. Maybe only 99% and you might not like that 1% change. It's still adheres to the basic philoshopy of "#nochanges". If you get the chance to chat with the developers, you can ask them. Until that time you'd have to be content with what they put out. If you haven't seen yet, I recommend watching the "Restoring History" panel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
Forgot about that half haha
---
damn :( i actually love those shiny badges. titles and all that shit and the sound of success when you finally grind rep to exalted or reach a new lvl milestone
---
Yes but Freezing Trap + Feign Death has 30 seconds cooldown and freeze up to 20 seconds.
---
people are actually believing this lmao
---
I was sure that only like 3 bosses did parryhaste there, and only on Sindra it was an actual issue..?
---
Can always try to go for 50 expertise hardcap in WotLK.
---
I remember running this dungeon in TBC to DE the drops for radiant shards(?) to make gold. had no idea if it was efficient or good money but damn if i didn't do it for hours and hours at a time to make enough for all the stupid stuff I wanted. like fiery and icy enchants for my weapons as a hunter just cause the glow looked cool.
---
Sorry to ask but wouldn’t the elf hunter pet still be visible?
---
This could be a huge buff for hunters. Hunters ability to reset their own threat via FD made them incredibly competitive in certain fights. With private server tanks doing massively more threat than they did in vanilla, this aspect of hunter play was no longer relevant. With these changes tanks will be doing much less threat, which could make hunter's FD ability relevant again in raiding.
---
Agree. Armor dyes, etc are the bane of MMOs
---
I remember wiping on this because we had no idea what the hell to expect... now that I think about it that was vanilla all around.
---
The way I see it it means every +5 weapon skill gives you back 1% crit.
---
https://youtu.be/_yThfdrdFL8
---
Anyone play on Illidan?  Imagine Grayrage with fame, he would simply break the server so horde wouldn't be able to level, filling it up with his fans and dominating every layer.  The only thing that stopped his guild's already trollish behavior was the fact that he was a dick and not that many people wanted to join his guild.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
You're going to have to find motivation to do things for the sake of doing them. That's what classic all about.
---
[Wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19323/the-unstoppable-force)
---
FF14 would take forever to travel if teleporting was not as easy to use... The game often makes you travel back and forth 4-5 times between 2 NPC that are across the world.
---
Regardless. I cant find 1.13 anywhere
---
PvP trinkets all do different things dependingon the class and none of them can remove Freezing Trap.
---
The lootable non-loot may be working as intended, some things don't drop anything some of the time.
---
I didn't consider shaman, is elemental spec viable in Dungeons/Raids? I guess it will be ele/resto. Gonna check it out, elemental sounds great.
---
this sub is *not* at its peak. wait until the launch.
---
You have no idea what immersion is, that's what it is.
---
People always demanding "rewards" is what lead to the tragedy that is BFA, where you're rewarded for every little thing, and the rewards behind it have got so thinned out Blizzard has to give out the same item over and over with a chance it will eventually proc to a better one, and then replace it anyway after a few weeks.
---
Getting loot isn't immersion. Being inside a cave for a quest and finding a chest inside with a rare sword, that's immersion. Doing a quest to unlock a unique mount by collecting different materials to make it is immersion.
---
Yes this is very much my biggest concern. 1.12 talents and itemization are already making the game far easier than it should be. Blizzard seems to be unwilling to touch the database of early raid boss values to adjust for the power creep that occurred during the life of vanilla. Hopefully the devil is in the details of the combat mechanics and MC and BWL won't be too much of a joke.
---
Yeah, everyone gets their own loot now. Dungeons too, the boss drops goodies for everyone individually, no rolling on things, you always get a participation trophy with random stats.
---
except vanilla is amazing because those shiny badges are given organically. just made it halfway through the leveling process? heres a sweet mount at 40. just turned 30 heres an awesome talent point or helm or ring. you just grind that rep? now you can finish all of mc or buy specific mats or patterns. vanilla gives you those shiny badges except the shiny badges arent pointless and actually mean something/ give you something ingame
---
That's right for most of the content, but Vael or Ony original Tail Sweeps would love to have a word with you :)
---
There's a lot of "from behind" mechanics from mobs but yeah you can avoid most, if you're skilled or pop good cd's. That's how DBM destroyed difficulty btw.
---
My thoughts as someone that started in vanilla beta and played daily in vanilla, semi-daily in TBC and a few times a week in Wrath is that the game got a bit more convoluted as the expansions passed out. I would at least consider playing wrath but that is where design choices started irritating me but the game was still great.
---
All of the expansions after that I just left after a week.
---
Playing on a private server right now on my 36 Shaman.   
---
Rockbiter tooltip shows +253 Attack Power. In reality, I get 296 Attack Power from it. Huh. 
---
So, It is confirmed that it scales on Private Servers.
---
Proof:

I haven't played WoW in AGES.  I played at launch and stopped just after the first expansion.  I recently subbed just to mess around for a bit and made a Tauren warrior.  The second I get to Thunderbluff, I see another low level Tauren riding in a motorcycle side car driven by an orc with a top hat.  A few minutes later I see a level 10 running around with what looked like epic high level gear.. transmogged (is that the term) I guess?  Kind of killed the immersion for me.
---
How would Blizzard moderate that? If a streamer is playing WSG and someone from the enemy team just opens up his stream to glean where the streamer and his team is, how would Blizzard find out? Work together with Twitch and cross reference every IP that connects to the channel with whoever is ingame? Not in a million years.
---
You're telling me that height matters?
---
To be fair the Defias Pillagers were easily the hardest single mobs in the game.
---
&gt; You're forgetting many of us didnt play vanilla, 
---
That doesn't really matter in today's gaming though.  Back then, WoW put MMO's on the map.  MMO's prior were the dorky, fat virgin thing to do.  Cool kids would never dare touch it.  But WoW changed that.  It broke the stigma of the genre.  But all those people that were jumping in experience an mmo for the first time - of course, its going to be amazing.  But today, its not like that anymore.
---
Since I quit WoW back in Wrath, I've played a slew of other MMO's.  For the most part, I just pick up an play.  Sure, there are a few things to figure out, but its not really that hard or time consuming to really get the gist of what is happening in this game.
---
So trying to regain those new, noob experience that made vanilla so amazing - it simply won't happen.  Yes, vanilla is more hardcore, but there are other hardcore mmo's on the market.  Today's consumers understand how to play mmos, how to navigate them, and how to flourish in them.  And even if they don't, the amount of information people can pick up about the game is endless now. Back then, at the start, most of us were in blind.  Now days, we are not blind anymore.  Whether you plaved vanilla or not, most have played an mmo.  Vanilla doesn't really do anything that other mmo's don't.  It made the genre cool, but that's about it.
---
This is an issue in all MMOs in today’s market for 2 reasons. 
---
1- games progress you entirely too fast. 
---
2- gamers, in general, play entirely too much. 3 hours a day M-F and 6+ on weekends is considered casual now? Seriously?
---
Delusional lol.
---
All good!
---
I remember it this way during TBC and WotLK as well. I think there was a little animation grabbing an arrow from it too.
---
This right here, and that's something that truly is an issue in today's retail version.
---
Rather than each expansion, every single patch now is destroying a large portion of the game that came before it, rendering it completely useless.
---
Lol this absolute pwnage
---
The Classic team has given me a glimmer of hope that the old Blizzard is still alive somewhere in there.
---
are you playing Tauren? then no
---
Same thing I do with any other gane I'm done with, stop playing.
---
Knowing how much time it will take me to get to kt without being carried, that's potentially years of content.
---
I remember Battle shout working like this, but in Vanilla the tooltip didn't show the updated amount, you had to check your stats to realize it.
---
Dont forget that it will give you back 1% crit for every +5 weapon skill you have since they said you loose 3% crit when there is 15 points difference in defense vs weapon skill.
---
But I think it wouldn't be such a big deal with MCP. I mean, if bear misses 2 Mauls, he's just as screwed as a warrior missing BT/Shield Slam + Sunder, and it happens within a similar time frame. Swipe (imagine it lands) should be quite similar to warrior's HS + offhand autoattack.
---
Alliance finaly have taurens too
---
Personally I don't care. I really want Vanilla as it was but I accept that we cannot have 1.12 re-released and also that Blizzard is not perfect. There will be inconsistencies, bugs and questionable decisions.
---
For example they really don't seem to care too much about the graphics. I mean getting it back to how it really was. I don't want to disparage the immense effort they went to add back the original assets (models, textures, animations, effects, etc.) and make them work. But the glow is too strong in Classic and the FOV calculations are not how they were in Vanilla. I'm a game developer and I know these would be very easy to correct (in case of the FOV most people wouldn't like the old method but a simple FOV slider would be enough). But it seems most people don't notice and/or care, so I'm sure these will remain as they are now.
---
As I said in my other post, it'll be a 99% recreation. I'll still play and enjoy it. :)
---
In tests on private servers ferals have been shown to do marginally more threat than a dual wield fury tank using /sit for crit procs. This advantage will only be greater in classic where you can no longer reliably exploit /sit.
---
What makes it fucking cooler (than me living vicariously through your photo) is the fact that you still have a nightsaber pet. Love this photo!
---
how far can autism truly go
---
Nice speculative approach 😊 If that would happen i could imagine quite some players would return to classic again just because of that. 
---
But i agree and also doubt they will do additional content.
---
Vanish clears threat, iceblock and bubble freeze threat meaning it will stay at the current level after the block/bubble clears.
---
to transmog an item you still needed to get it. so if you saw someone wearing XYZ armor you would still know how hard it is to get and it was something they had to do, it just means they arent wearing those pieces but they have at some point
---
Instead of a prompt, the user usually has an option to initiate a saving process of recent program data. See it as the way twitch live streaming works: the streamer provides a constant stream of data (here: the game provides a constant stream of data). Then, something memorable happens (here: a bug happens). Twitch itself doesn't know that the streamer just won a 1v4 against good enemies, but the viewers and the streamer do. So, the viewers clip the epic fight and share it around to everybody. The clipping function always saves the last few seconds of action, keeping it ready to be recorded. Same with a bug. The program "records" itself the entire time, keeping itself ready to be asked for the data and sending them off to a human inspector.
---
Huh? That doesn't make much sense lol. If you have the mount to theoretically transmog it, wouldn't you just ride the mount?
---
I want this too but I'll be going Horde. For some reason I get a feeling most RPPVP players are gonna be playing on alliance (humans are easier to roleplay with for most, also goldshire memes)
---
Makes me kinda worried about faction balance. A 50/50 alliance/horde split is ideal but having to be the 20 or 30% minority would really suck
---
I was a tank.
---
Okay thanks, wowhead was wrong.
---
Unblizzlike buffs? Dude are you high?
---
I will be playing one btw
---
BC was the best WoW was. Sunwell was the best raid instance ever. SSC and TK were good once the bugs fixed.
---
It’s the classic beta patch, was never one during actual vanilla.
---
Oh man. Ya beat me to it.
---
[wowhead...](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19323/the-unstoppable-force) look under the quick facts section
---
Yeah but hey, as if the NA raiding scene was alive at all
---
I honestly have no idea how transmogs even work. I didn't know you had to have a piece of gear already to transmog it. I stopped playing during wotlk
---
great thinking! this made me more excited for the game
---
Pursuit of Justice. 8% movement and mounted speed.
---
Yeah well wowhead was made really late so it's a terrible source for when things came out
---
Most of my experience has been in Vanilla and Wrath; limited exposure to TBC, so take this with a grain of salt. But it seems to me that each of the three "old world" versions of the game had a different strength.
---
Vanilla was the strongest as an RPG. At making you feel like a little nobody adventurer in this world of titans. You struggle against the world, and incrementaly get a little bit stronger until you're a hero. But you aren't out saving the world from ending, you're out slaying a dragon, and clearing out a mountain. Noble work, but no end-of-the-world peril.
---
TBC seemed to be the strongest for competitive play, *especially* PvE. There was still no RDF, and the rep grinds at endgame were huge. People will also talk your ear off about the quality of TBC raiding. Classes were in an extremely balanced place, and it seems like it gave players a chance to really show their abilities as raiders.
---
WotLK was the strongest cinematically, and in story. It is picking up where a lot of the Warcraft 3 plot left off, and the production value of the expansion is just insane. The tone is epic, and your character has been around the block by now. You are a badass, but just beginning to be one (you haven't been a badass for the last 6 expansions so the power levels haven't gotten comical yet).
---
I feel you. Didn’t get beta so now I’m a Private server hero
---
Hunters usually win the speed leveling contest.
---
Sometimes, Druids, Warlocks, or a Mage will be first instead.
---
Basically, a Hunter really only has to have a decent bow or gun, and rest of the gear is "nice to have".
---
Druids and Warlocks really aren't gear dependant for leveling. 
---
Mage, really needs for the AE farm spots to be empty,  if another mage shows up, the both knock each other out of the running for first.
---
2005 is pre-tbc
---
you need to learn to read
---
I have love for both Vanilla and TBC. I love Vanilla for its setting, the world. Well, everything. But TBC gave so much love to classes, and made (almost) all specs viable in some way (with the items that worked for them). Also, the HC's were a lot of fun and I made really good friends running those alongside guild raids.
---
But for WotlK I don't have a lot of a fondness, I found the tanking extremely boring as a warrior (with overpowered thunderclap, shockwave and the block value stat removed). Still, as a Warcraft fan, I was happy to see the Lich King, finishing the story Warcraft III started.
---
Isnt it affected by quivver haste?
---
this is the beta patch.
---
19 - So many classes are god tier and have there own play style and role, so all classes are really needed but god tier is priests, rogue, mage, hunter, paladin.
---
29 - Same as 19, huge hp pools more to do with utility and burst, rogue priest hunter mage dominate this bracket, Holy pals are god tier here.
---
39 - A lot of classes that did shit dmg back in the lower brackets like warrior, shaman, now have more power due to Pendulum of Doom, rogues at 39 are pretty much unbeatable 1v1 unless your a god, warlocks mages also do huge damage here.
---
49 - Everyone is pretty OP with all the gear upgrade and skills, ide say warrior with a pocket healer is the best here, but all classes are more balanced in this bracket.
---
I mean.. that's true of vanilla wow as well though. For example, you would never stay in Elwynn Forest when you could be leveling in Redridge/Duskwood. You're just gimping yourself for no reason by doing that. The gear will always be better in a higher level zone until you hit the cap and that's true of leveling in general. That was not an expansion issue nor is it a dynamic scaling issue.
---
I remember tanking this on my ud warrior, thinking I was the boss at the time haha.
---
Reminds me when I got like 46/50 on the online Jeopardy test and a couple weeks later I get an email from them with the subject 'Congratulations!' and the message was just them saying congrats on taking it, too many people do well so people will get a random invite if they did well and were randomly drawn.
---
Never did get invited to audition.
---
It's amazing how many idiots can't grasp this.
---
because 1.13 IS THE CURRENT VERSION OF BETA THAT WILL RELEASE AS CLASSIC 
---
jesus christ
---
I envy you brother. I played into Cata. I really should have stopped in Wrath
---
Instead of mostly meaningless badges, you get actual rewards most of the time in return, in-game. Just keep an open mind, and perhaps it will spark joy ;)
---
That's perfectly acceptable. I personally am in the same boat, I mostly just play private servers to learn a few things here and there, but when classic comes out I will be taking my time and enjoying the ride. I just think its important that WoW is a huge game that satiates lots of different appetites, and thus there are many paths to fun :)
---
It matters, somewhat, it's just that Blizzard decided they don't really care about this. It's absolutely the case that they can't have the old macro/scripting system because of exploits. They use the most up-to-date, most hardened and fixed version, which is the current one. Then they modify it to make it more like how it was. It requires judgement calls and they decided that what you want will not be available, even though it was in Vanilla. Maybe they have persuasive reasons, maybe don't. It's a very large project, oversights happen.
---
Yes, but the base cast time is 3.5 seconds excluding haste. The tooltip is incorrectly displaying cast time as 3 seconds with 0% haste.
---
I'm not sticking mine in that thing
---
They normally don't ofc.
---
This is just hear say and my bad memory but, as a healer I remember yelling at hunters to move their pet behind the boss for this reason. 
---
To my memory hunter pets can trigger this too and will be something to watch out for, I know for sure they did in TBC.
---
sorry i know that 1.13 is the beta. I am saying that when looking through the old patch notes this item is added well before 1.11
---
I honestly don't care about liking him or not, like him or not that doesn't change the fact he played huge role in us having classic today.
---
It's moments like these when I realize the "people are better at WoW now, so classic raiding will be easier" crowd are full of shit.
---
I played vanilla, bc, and wotlk, and didn't know this mechanic (though I only raided in classic, as combat daggers rogue, so was always behind the target anyways)
---
Also, a lot of our collective knowledge is 15 years stale, full of misrememberance and superstition, and confused with later mechanics from expansions or other games or pservers.
---
Classic raiding will be easier - for progression guilds.  Anyone in a guild not vying for "world firsts" is going to be playing with the same difficulty - boss guides and all.
---
Yikes, gamer btw
---
When the epic quality was epic.
---
Cheers for hunters relative dps increasing. Could partially explain the large meta away from hunter to rogue/warrior dps
---
Code may be too much of a mess, while a test can be ran quickly and be just as reliable.
---
Gnomes are only three apples tall!
---
Thanks for the video, I'll check it out.
---
In fact I'm more of an advocate for certain changes. I'm more on a "restore the relative experience" side.
---
Sure, vanilla didn't have certain things patched or fixed, but at the same time not enough people knew about them. Nowadays almost EVERYONE will know about them, and if that were the case back then, they would have been changed. 
---
Sure, vanilla had some technological limitations, and even when they could do it they probably didn't get the green light to increase the debuff limit, because it's easier to just release that change with the new expansion, when you don't have to bother about retuning the old bosses. But if they knew they were going to have 40 man raids from day 1 of development, and had today's technology, there wouldn't have been such an unreasonable limit, and it would have made the game better.
---
How can you be sure the railing there is the same size in both pictures
---
Guess again... Pre TBC patch launched on december 5th 2006. Dark portal opening was january 9th 2007.
---
Yes indeed.
---
Where are the right screens from?
---
I have this number in my head from TBC. Our MT was a druid and 70% damage reduction from armor sticks in my head.
---
Your name seems familiar. You played on Destromath?
---
Gotta get that mana back up after a pull :D
---
Me discovering your comment discovering his comment discovering their main discovering Wetlands for the first time on Vanilla WoW
---
My preference is BC, Classic, Wrath. I played through Cata but those 3 always stood out.
---
I really hope Blizz continue after Naxx but stick with level 60. They could add and convert Caverns of time, Kara and Blackrock Descent without needing to add any more zones.
---
&gt;because 1.13 IS THE CURRENT VERSION OF BETA THAT WILL RELEASE AS CLASSIC
---
You okay, friend? It's a bit early to be freaking out already. Maybe a little break from Reddit and wow, for your health.
---
Can someone explain transmog plz?
---
That’s a really fucking weird way of saying it. But whatever, I’m super hype to play this pre-wrath server
---
Every time, someone would get bored/impatient and pull extras.
---
Those are not hunter class quests. 
---
There's only the lvl10 quest to tame pet for all hunter races and then at 50 there's a hunter quest that comes out in a later patch.
---
gnomes aren't bigger, the world is smaller, this matches up with the move speed inaccuracies everybody feels too fast!!
---
Don’t tell me how to live my life
---
i mean you can still grin rep to exalted just you don't get a useless achievement for it you just get the warm fuzzy feeling inside that you worked your arse off for it and you should be proud that you did
---
I'm playing thru the Warcraft RTS games. GOG has 1&amp;2 for $15. Warcraft did not age well, but the nostalgia is great. Warcraft 2 is still great and WC 3 and it's Frozen Throne expac really builds the hype for WoW. If nothing else, I highly recommend WC3 and The Frozen Throne. They are fantastic RTS games and contain all the necessary lore for Classic.
---
Plot twist, everything else is the wrong size.
---
A lot of these console commands were available in vanilla, too. The client had the recommended range of settings, but people could go above or below those with console commands.
---
Some people who played with hardware below the minimum specs would use console commands to lower variables below their minimum. Some other options were common for disabled gamers. There were console scripts that would enlarge nameplates and other parts of the UI, which was helpful for people with limited vision. Things like maximum camera distance were helpful for people who were using click-to-move.
---
imo it makes sense to limit options that give an unfair pvp advantage, but leave the rest in. It doesn't hurt anyone to have jumbo nameplates be an option.
---
What does activated sub mean? I have game time left but my subscription is not set to be renewed because BFA doesn’t interest me.
---
You give him way too much cred in that theory.
---
the big ones are from the stress test, the small ones are from an 1.12.1 client
---
No they are same size. Everything else is smaller.
---
I think you might have a different interpretation of ';)' than what I usually see online.
---
There's way less of this in Vanilla than ever. One boss in MC, zero in BWL (unless you count overaggroing a breathing dragon as such mechanic).
---
Actually no. Nobody really asked players what they want. 
---
An OSRS-like voting system (for max lvl players and solid time played) is ASKING players what they want. Not a random blue post on forums, where all the idiots can reply.
---
I may be seeing things through rose tinted memories, but as I remember it tab targeting was *extremely* good in retail vanilla, especially after hundreds of hours of using it. 
---
If someone is zoomed in and clicking... yeah I can see a bat being effective in that way. Especially on private servers where I've been having a lot of trouble with targeting, though that could just be lack of practice. 
---
And yeah that's how I'm using my stable slots as well, with the exception that I've been using feline pets whenever possible since before WoW was announced so I usually just have a second cat in my third slot.
---
I thought you need more with dual wielding.. wasn't there like a 21% goal?
---
Makes sense, and after reading the admins initial post, it seems likely that a similar implementation was used.
---
Thanks! Makes sense now.
---
dont quote me as my brother and other half were the pvpers but I think it is based on your frostwolf rep as to what you can buy from them
---
Literally unplayable
---
That's wierd, because I am using the Classic setting.
---
Nah. That's part of the fun.
---
level 6
---
Upvoted, but expertise was TBC.
---
Maybe Gnomes have evolved in the past 15 years ?
---
I am looking at the Classic wowhead, but maybe it is something buggy with the version of Firefox I'm using or the OS I'm using, could be.
---
Does anyone truly believe that? It seems *blindingly* obvious to me that they're going to leave current WoW as-is for the people that want either A. the absolute most hardcore raiding available or B. the watered down version of the rest of the game, and then Classic will be for everybody else that's missed what the game was. I can see it being split fairly evenly down the middle.
---
Like you say, they can't just gut everything that's kept (certain) people playing retail after all this time. Also, given that the subscription covers both games, I doubt they're bothered whether or not people are playing one or the other. Classic is going to be a *huge* boost for them.
---
Yeah but you can't fix it with layering short of removing it.
---
i dont think he means the tbc pre-patch i think he means it was in before tbc come out
---
Yeah, definitely. Even in Vanilla they get capped on Armor pretty easily. Paired with high Dodge chance and health.
---
They produce a lot of threat, but we know now that tanks will produce less threat because they will be parried more by the bosses.
---
So warlocks will have to look very carefully at their threat meter to avoid agroing the boss.
---
Two tanks? Hell yeah classic!
---
They won't exist so I guess that answers it.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Depends if you mean white or yellows
---
Dont have beta so I cant confirm, but it looks just like the raid frames in retail, and with those you can split it up to be based on groups.
---
Are you okay? Does it hurt anywhere?
---
needs some deep breathing exercises to release the rage in a more controlled manner
---
Well I dont have any plans to participate in that kind of RP Im glad I have the option I guess if the servers do come out lol. If anything I can be a horde rogue where his sole purpose is to eradicate the world of sexual depravity..and pick flowers.
---
Exactly what iv been saying since they announced layering. Unless there is a massive drop-off, gl merging layers.
---
You knew the real players by there armor and mount. I remember working so hard to get to 2k in RBG to get a set. Nowadays anyone can look “legit”.
---
All hail the only and true version of wow: the classic.
---
To be more serious tho, I don't wanna bury the druid off tanks yet. I still believe that their TPS will be superior and they can remain relevant, especially in a magic damage heavy enviroment as a HP tank.
---
The math will show it anyway, so be positive about it.
---
FUCK YES! That's a new one for me. You made my morning.
---
I always enjoyed the lighting of this zone, but loathed the fucking murlocs.
---
Oh I won’t deny that.  I was implying the elitists will get ahead while everyone else is leveling at their own pace and those are the people who will help each other out (although not saying the elite won’t pitch in).  That will leave a divide for a bit but, at 60, anything goes.
---
Retail is a lost cause.
---
Apparently jerking off to hentai isn't the answer
---
&gt;  look at streamers already having little to do 
---
The stupidity of this statement is unbelievable.
---
You are talking about a closed Beta with lvl 30 cap that is 2 weeks old. Everyone is already 30 and ran all dungeons already.
---
What the hell did you expect the streamers to do after that?
---
&gt; every change in wow has been to open the game up more to a larger audience.
---
And has failed to do so as every iteration post wrath has lost subscribers. 
---
Wow and MMOs as a genre cater inherently to the hardcore gamers, but has tried to expand their audience and failed to get both, we'll probably see the amount of subscribers multiply several times over with vanilla release.
---
Oh no you will have to heal a couple extra times :(
---
Nope.
---
It will just kill it.
---
TBC had the best additions and class balance
---
But having flying, and being off azeroth is a deal breaker for some. These 2 additions was the beginning of making the world seem smaller, and the leveling part of the game seem more like a chore
---
I request of blizz to make 4k, 1440p and ultrawide versions of this wallpaper  
---
stat!
---
I think more people would think that classic would be able to set the foundation of a new mmorpg with the same philosophy as the classic. Like a wow 2 or something.
---
Ohh, it's a wowhead running it's database for items in Classic wow Beta, 1.13. got it now...
---
Then he should have been more clear. When ppl say PreTBC we refer as the pretbc patch with new talents and shit.
---
Otherwise why not just call vanilla a whole pretbc expansion.. Or every other expension pre bfa at this point.
---
I can't imagine people that stuck around with the later expansions didn't do so because they somewhat loved or at the very least neutral to the changes Blizzard did over the years. You would only be punishing those players.
---
This is why we have classic. I sincerely hope both games flourish for many more years despite having zero interest in retail.
---
Accept retail for what it is. Nothing needs "saving."
---
Backhand has a better one
---
I lol'd
---
I see laserchicken :&gt;
---
oh, im warlock tanking anyway so thats a good thing
---
There's a publically available reference client?
---
That quest won't even be in the game
---
Envy. Always.
---
Running on a private server or original Vanilla WoW?
---
Lets put it like this. For the time back then vanilla was better than TBC. nowadays the gameplay of TBC suits the need of the modern player way more than classic does, replayability is way higher and it does have more competetive gameplay. I am one of the few that found tbc to be slightly better in general now and back then.
---
everything has evolved in the last 15 years, the purpose of classic is to literally revert to the old glory
---
Combat rogue + AR + BF + all the heals you could be spared from the healer = the best 10 seconds of your life until you die.
---
I was specifically referring to the pvp sets.  I played in vanilla but didn’t pay much attention because my guild was relatively casual and only ended up clearing AQ and 1-2 Naxx bosses.  I was moreso asking if the set bonuses were different for the blue and purple pvp sets.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bslxiz/gnomes_are_the_correct_height/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Oh ok, so the "Classic" version of wowhead is not only Vanilla?
---
I dunno. I seem to remember a post on here a little while back where somebody contacted customer service about it and in the email they received, they employee stated you must have an active subscription to get a beta invite.
---
I'd imagine that just means if your sub is currently active you can receive an invite.
---
We get it, you like romantic anime
---
You'd think Orcs cutting down and burning everything they come across wouldn't sit well with the Tauren either, but here we are.
---
* fury tanks will take a hell of a lot more damage due to parry hasting, and will output less threat.
---
* melee will do less DPS due to the 1% increase in dodge, which will likely translate into &gt;1% nerf.
---
It's hard to see how fury tanks will stay relevant - not only will they take more damage, but every fight is now going to last a lot longer due to the TPS nerf, meaning more pressure on healer resources.
---
Ooooohhhhh I remember that :O
---
The best part about being "wow sober" for 7 years (and having a terrible memory) is that I don't remember these kind of details. Even the stress-test feels brand new, and I have these "Oohh yeah that's right" moments.
---
ALL specs in Classic are VIABLE.
---
Do not confuse VIABLE with OPTIMAL for RAIDING Naxxramas.
---
So, a private server? 'Cuz the size of player models is determined server side.
---
"LPT:...."
---
"FYI..."
---
"PSA..."
---
I think that’s because in vanilla u will always have 1% miss chance no matter what.
---
The point of the dw fury tank is that you have an offhand still generating rage for you while you are using heroic strikes. That and flurry.
---
With a 2hander you don't have anything generating rage for you when you're heroic striking, other than the damage the boss is doing to you.
---
BC&gt;&gt;&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wrath
---
Would play BC till the day i die if i could.
---
Elder Scrolls Online has been a welcome distraction for me until classic arrives. IMO it's a pretty great MMO, though for very different reasons than classic.

Cat pets have stealth.

Yep a long time ago

Fuck around on the private servers. That's what I'm doing
---
The pictures are different, yes. Why do you think one it's correct. Things can be different and be correct.
---
So brave
---
The amount of liberties taken and factpinion in this is pretty impressive.
---
Whats the source? Are the screenshots on right from blizzard vanilla back in 04-06, or some other version of 1.12 like a private server?
---
Same, but with getting an email from Blizzard and it's just the stress test instead of beta.
---
Unfortunately. Ive heard the opposite.
---
My friend at Blizz added me to F&amp;F on 5/21. Said I should get in 5/23. Others on F&amp;F were told the same since I spoke to some people in the same spot as me.
---
This week, he came to me saying sorry, I know how excited you were, but they arent inviting people anymore. They feel they are at the perfect capacity. He said Friends and Family are no longer getting it.
---
Didn't provide an ETA, but id expect only streamers are getting in the next few weeks. 
---
On the SLIM chance a wave does come, gotta imagine F&amp;F will have priority considering how many did not get in yet.
---
If anyone has a different source, you can feel free to reply or PM. But this is from my friend at Blizz who added me to his F&amp;F list and spoke to the Classic team as he was wondering why I wasnt in yet.
---
Conor McGregor: Fock retail
---
Can we soon stop this discussion. I mean its 2-3 years in the future. Let's see how the game is recieved first? Maybe it will be better for blizzard to do seasonal realms. Maybe post 1.12 content. Maybe let people trasfer their toon to a tbc realm. Maybe they should make a new game with the design philosophy of classic in mind. Who knows as of now let's get home first before we talk about going away again
---
press x to doubt. i think what lots of people on reddit truly believe is that if they and a few people posting here dont like bfa, then nobody does. this is untrue.
---
The issue is I can go and blast through the hard raid tiers of past expansions. Everyone can. So if you got the amazing black temple set when it was current, that is an amazing accomplishment. But now everyone has it, and nothing feels special.
---
same here i only need it for my fix
---
I don't think this is what is happening in the situation I'm describing. You're describing the Shadowcraft -&gt; Darkmantle situation, right?
---
I'm talking about when you search for Shadowcraft in the dressing room, I'm given 4 functioning results, all of which look like Shadowcraft but with different coloring and different stats (but none of them with the coloring and stats like darkmantle)
---
&gt; why stick to old continent and cities of the green loot "over there" it's even better than the raid one?
---
1.) Because you want to complete the zone's questlines.
---
2.) You can go to the next continent, get some quest greens to move up in gear, and then go back to the original continent and burn through the zones.
---
3.) In retail a lot of people have heirloom gear so this isn't really relevant.
---
Your question is still a bit odd though since it seems to just be complaining that xpacs have better gear than the prior one which is fundamental to any RPG.
---
Wasn't this already debunked? Someone posted a link where it said gnome model for players was scaled up, whilst pirate realms get this wrong
---
Still have this on my priest whom I never play since I hate how they play now compared to once upon a time...
---
This is terrible advice. Just level at your own pace then help out whenever you can.
---
Leveling with a group is only a pleasant experience if everyone is putting in the same effort. It sucks being the one always having to wait for others. Likewise feeling like you're letting the others down.
---
There are always plenty of people at every stage of the game. Make some new friends and you'll all be able to play together in the end.
---
&gt; This will actually make the game HARDER
---
....but not really enough to offset the ~15% extra melee damage due to bosses having less armor.
---
God that's bad
---
So a private server, where you can change the size of the models server-side. Gotcha.
---
Nelson here. be cool to level on same server either way. If you're going Horde.. :)
---
How exactly do you access a private server?
---
Imagine caring if someone was "legit" in WoW.
---
There is a thread somewhere that someone compared a picture from vanilla with the beta and they ARE the correct size.
---
Reputation level. Need exalted for unstoppable force
---
&gt; on nostalrius people were useing 1.3 speed dagger
---
Only because rage generation was bugged (was not taking armor into account) and thus tanks were always rage capped all the time.
---
Wrath was the first expac where they started enforcing a theme and story to the end game. It was all about the Lich King (they also had many cinematics to enforce this, as well as 3 dungeons)
---
Classic, Kelthuzad is not really seen as the man villian.
---
TBC has somewhat related raids, but even with Illidan being on the cover he wasnt the final raid, and it wasnt all about him.
---
WOTLK has some of my fondest memories cuz thats when i was old enough to remember, and do shit properly. I was actually able to raid the final tier. However TBC is probably the best expac, and would be superior to Classic, if they made flying less OP.
---
&gt; What have they done that has been so detrimental to this server? 
---
This server? You mean KT? Because if you read again, I said they will ruin the CLASSIC realm they play in.
---
That said, if in your personal experience you have not encountered any of their shit, it doesn't mean it's not there. I would argue it's most likely because of all of the realms being mixed together....
---
...You DO know that in retail all non-rp realms are merged together right? It doesn't matter if you're in KT, Sarg, BH, or whatever, having a mixture of people from all realms makes it harder for you to see the same faces again and again.
---
Now.. to answer why they are and will be even more detrimental to classic, I put my own personal experience as example. I don't even watch the guy, I found out about him because of his in-game trolling and storming of areas, specifically on the MG realm where he comes with 2 full raids of monkeys who do everything he orders them to. Why does he come when he clearly hates rp and looks down upon people who enjoy it? to troll and disrupt everything going around him.
---
Anyhow.. In classic realms are not merged together, hence zone flooding, node overtaking and intentionally lagging the server matters, and IS detrimental to other player's experience, whether you by lucky chance never experience it yourself or not.
---
TBC has better endgame content (heroic dungeons into raids), WOTLK had the best raid of all time Ulduar (but also added lfg and easy aoe tanking :puke: ) .... Vanilla is all around a good game. Fun raids, Fun pvp, Fun and Rewarding leveling.
---
My favorite Expansion was TBC, but all around I think vanilla is a better experience.
---
I think this entire back and forth went completely over your head.
---
Just play the game and you'll find enough friends in no time at all. That's the beauty of vanilla.
---
Lets completely overlook everything else in the post and only looks at the negative why don't we ..
---
Yeah I feel like this is way more of a problem of the stacked expansions than Transmog itself.
---
I feel like if classic had transmog people would only be transmoging down.  Like Warriors who like the look of Tier 1 better than Tier 2.
---
Are you raiding in 2004? Every melee group has a shaman if your guild is in any way shape or form trying to succeed.
---
See you in barrens chat fools

It's not the gnomes that are too large, it's the world that is too small? [Mindblowing](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif)

Regarding the screenshot: Doesn't titan panel round to the nearest significant digit? The player's hit could easily be 7.9% which would be 8% when rounded to the nearest sig digit. This screenshot doesn't prove anything.
---
&gt;(X) Doubt. Doesnt do for me
---
private servers don't use the proper scaling factor of x 1.15 for gnomes, hence the difference
---
Yeah, it will be crystal clear when 80% of the WoW players will spend most of their time in Classic, and only like 30 min. on Retail.
---
There will be a lot of red lights blinking at Blizzard HQ after August 27th.
---
&gt; wrath it actually seems is easier raids at least early on
---
idk Id say ICC and ToC were pretty easy, where as ulduar is regarded as one of the more difficult raids of any expac.
---
also dont forget the earlier raids didnt have heroic. Only ulduar (kind of), ToC, and ICC did
---
Just leave retail as it is, it's a completely different experience, yet very enjoyable on its own
---
Except nothing changes if your threat cap raises but your highest threat dps's threat goes up by the same amount...
---
That would be fine and all if you kept your progress, but you don't. If you really want to just piss away 150 bucks I'll send you my paypal..
---
For what it's worth guys, I got into the beta early last week, and I never got an email from Blizzard.  So I'm not even sure there's much point in checking your email - just check your launcher.
---
If I had just waited for the email, I'd have no idea I was in the beta.

18 years of kiting, I hope he’s a hunter main.

---
Okay, then what do you do when pretty much all the realms in one "battlegroup" are dead you get 1 medium population one and it keeps further dying because of it or what if one battlegroup ends up having multiple highest population realms? What about if you are on PVP server and when that battlegroup merges you are now on realm with 80-20 faction balance and as cherry on top there's big streamer that you hoped to avoid who rolled 1 month in on one of your battlegroup realms. Yeah, I think I'll take that temporary layering for the launch over any of this hassle..

I played 1-5 undead with no disconnects last night after a few "world server is down" errors and a computer crash at the opening cinematic. I wish I had time to play to 10.

No. Private servers were wrong.

You have to remember that warrior became good dps with their revamp, which means these guilds had no geared warrior at the time. Now that we are using 1.12 we will start using warriors immediately.
---
I never really read through the text because people always instantly start everything, why does the group turn on you?
---
I'm absolutely against any changes. I want Vanilla the game, as it was.
---
Because I haven't played it. If it's changed, I can't play it ever. :(
---
Classic is not about the "experience". You cannot have the "experience" back, anyway. You cannot go back into the past. But you can have the game. Just like you can play thousands upon thousands of old games. Just recently I played Dungeon Master the first time (released in 1987). It was very good. So I couldn't have the "experience" of playing the game when it came out but I could create my own new experience now.
---
And Classic is not about making the game "better". It'd be a very stupid goal (sorry). If anyone wants a "better" Vanilla, they should ask Blizzard to create that, then. Separate from Classic. Why are so many people so selfish that they'd destroy Vanilla (again) just so they can have their "better game"? Not that it would happen, anyway. Old Blizzard is long dead. Current Blizzard is incapable of and will not ever create anything resembling Vanilla ever again. If they started to change Classic (to "improve" it), it'd just became BfA 2.
---
Hahaha you are so smug and superior sounding it is hilarious.

it's so bad though :/

Not the same angles, I want pixel perfect screenshot or I will not accept OP's argument. Have a good day, I must got count the number of time the washing machine rotate in a wash cycle.

"Unsolicited group invite". Jesus christ. 
---
If people aren't mentally challenged they should understand why someone is inviting them in that particular moment.
---
Same experience here.  Been in the beta for over a week now.  Still no email.
---
Check your launcher, guys - don't rely on the email.
---
One of my fondest memories
---
some would argue that this is when choices started to matter less, thus the game felt less challenging.
---
While i agree that if they are gonna have 3 tank specs, then they should all  actually be able to tank, i dont think every spec needs to be entirely viable.
---
I miss the days of less viable specs only working out if you got the perfect gear set
---
10 man raids cane in with Wotlk
---
Each had its upsides and downsides, but you won't find unanimous agreement on just what features are which. Taking BC and my own preferences as an example:
---
BC probably had the best talent system from any version of the game. The game was fairly well balanced without sacrificing much in the way of class uniqueness or identity. Raids and quests were great. Arenas were great as a concept (but flawed in execution.)
---
But the new races weren't great (mismatched lore and aesthetics), it effectively segregated high level players from everyone else, introduced flying (which hurt WPvP), started the "artificial difficulty" trend with heroic dungeons, introduced dailies, damaged faction rivalry with the neutral capital city, introduced the immersion-breaking "resilience" stat, the arena system forced specific class match-ups to be balanced (instead of allowing rock-paper scissors), some stuff got streamlined/normalised out of the game (lots of small things, example would be warlock summoning utility being rendered near worthless due to summoning stones), all the end-game content from Vanilla was basically killed, and levelling speed was increased to rush players through to the "new content".
---
This is just off the top of my head. I do think that an ideal version of WoW would mix and match select elements from each of these three expansions, but my ideal selection would be very different from someone who cared more about the competitive PvP scene and less about immersive RPG elements.
---
If you look only the the glancing blow damage reduction part, then weapon skill is equally good from 300 to 308.
---
ZF is and will most probably always be my favourite dungeon. I remember the first time I created the epic sword, good times!
---
If I'm fast enough, I want to name my Rogue "Rouge"
---
lol
---
But there are cases where killed mob has no loot and doesn't have the icon and effect of a lootable mob. So if it's a false posivite for loot then it should rather be fixed... unless it's actuall vanilla feature of trolling players - if so I want to know which developer did that :P
---
How is OP a hypocrite? He tried inviting the guy to finish the quest together. The autist declined. Then when he realized OP got the mob tag he suddenly wanted to group up.

Well, that is because you started in 2010-2011...which is Wrath/Cata.
---
Ofc you will LIKE BfA, it's almost as boring as Wrath/Cata. You got all your Wrath/Cata "goodies" : LFD, LFR, content difficulties and epics showering over you.
---
No wonder you enjoy it.
---
Bloodlust isn't a thing in vanilla. It came in TBC.
---
Imagine someone caring enough to comment this.
---
Was here last night, good times for AOEers
---
rude and ungentlemanly.
---
Blizzard shouldv'e introduced a color wheel or something instead, the essence of the gear remains but at least you can color code it with the rest of your shit.
---
You don't need to feign death when you are actually dead. 🤫
---
Make gnome small again!
---
&gt;I wonder how many here are being honest about their vanilla experience?
---
Well, i think it goes a bit like this.
---
Some people actually were quite good at the game back in vanilla. The more hardcore players.  Some kept playing through the expansions, some quit.   Some discovered private servers and played there in later years. Especially from 2015-2019 that scene was quite big and arguably the reason Blizzard decided to go for it. 
---
I do think that people who are in this 'pre launch classic community'  , where this subreddit is part of, are  relatively often from that original pool of 'good players.'    Because that are the sort of players who kept interest in the original game all these years.
---
The more casual players from 2005-2006 are more likely not the ones that spend time on forums and reddits , 10 years later discussing the game.  So I find it plausible that there are so many 'experts'
---
i'm hoping it continues but i know from the other betas i have been in the testers tend to band together a lot better than on live, maybe its because our guild isn't there for you to retreat into and ignore the rest of the world maybe its because a lot of the arseholes aren't on beta, i dont know but that's been my experience with the others. as i say i'm hoping the lack of LFG and only sharing your mob with your group will make people more likely to group up just for the sake of grouping rather than just running along like a mindless bot in a dungeon
---
PLEASE, if anybody here is able to take a screenshot of the settings in mangos/other servers, where you can change the scale of playable races, to proof i'm wrong, do it. I CAN'T be the only one who remember gnomes smaller, am I?
---
But it’s purple tho
---
You are payed by Blizzard or just dumb?
---
No, it takes brain cells and an elementary education to be able to read
---
Not true. Special attacks never miss at 8% and iirc you can eliminate white hits with 2h or 1h, just not worth the stat investment.
---
This made me so happy and I don't even know why
---
Already confirmed as a bug. Stop baiting for upvotes. This isn't layering, you wouldn't layer for getting invited into a layer with people that are next to you.
---
playing gnome funnily enough.
---
Yeah I'm going to try chaosbane with a friend
---
That does make sense :p I totally agree - having a warrior and druid both MT/OT is pretty nice! I mean there are different fights for different tanks...
---
GOnna roll druid too I think so I´m happy about that :D
---
I am only still subbing at this point for a chance to play Beta. I have been on the past two stress tests and I know I won't be back to retail in it's current state. Vanilla has a sense of danger on each encounter, you actually need to think about attacking a mob before just jumping in pulling.
---
Sure you're about to, MOUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
I'd go one on a PvP server, but the ability to literally troll people is too good to pass up for my pun loving self.
---
Agreed. The beginning of the end was the introduction of Badges of Justice near the end of BC. I remember plenty of raiders starting to quit because you could get T6 equivalent loot for doing dungeons. 
---
This was just built on during WOTLK and typically why WOTLK is in a different class than BC and vanilla. 
---
That being said i still loved WOTLK. But BC and vanilla in general were better.
---
Thanks, these days my play time is far more limited (2 small children, wife etc) so I'd love to find a guild that fits in with my busy life)
---
lol what the fuck
---
We're most certainly *not* talking 1 for 1 here - we're talking 40 for 40. You're not just taking that debuff away from one warlock - you're taking it away from maybe five of them and a couple priests. The minor damage increase you *might* see (and that's iffy) from not being furry certainly does not justify that damage loss over that many players.
---
Rogues and fury warriors are the 2 classes I've been having the most trouble filling prelaunch. I guess people assume they are over populated or will be to hard to level/gear.
---
Honey I'm taking day off today. Stress test, it's real important that I show up. They are relying on me.
---
It's a hidden mechanic, not like you'd find it in those tutorial blurbs in a starting zone. I wouldn't feel bad about not knowing.
---
The real stress test
---
I just told you. OP is implying ***his*** way of playing the game is superior while not acknowledging that other people may have ***their own*** preferred way to play the game.
---
I know it's hard. Try reading it multiple times.
---
Bloodfang looks the coolest and won't be hard to get.
---
&gt;Like it or not, Classic cannot save Retail. Retail is beyond saving.
---
Retail doesn't need saving.  Like it or not, BFA is still the most populated and profitable MMO on the market.  So long as people still play it, it doesn't need any of the hardcore vanilla raiding elements for it to continue to progress and make money.
---
As for classic: its like you said, a lot of new players, or modern day mmo players likely won't take to classic.  Why?  Vanilla was too much of a time sink.  Even when I was in AQ40 gear, taking a pug though DM could still take 1-2 hours.  It is simply too much for the majority of players to take to.
---
nobody likes quinn
---
Lmao layering is the exact same thing with bigger downsides. I’m done you’re apparently not capable of understanding.
---
Not quite classic, but this was always a favorite, rating each class by how [Metal](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/8197652592?page=1) they were. Another favorite but I can't find maybe someone can, is why warriors were the best class, talked about how the warrior didn't use tricks or magic, just that they were the weapon.
---
I highly doubt it will be more profitable to disenchant quest items rather than just vendoring them. Atleast during the first few weeks after launch.
---
Imagine all the people, living life in peace.
---
Yeah...right. I started FF 2 months ago, to kill time until Classic.
---
FF is a slightly better BfA, in some parts. You got LFD, you got LFR, you got badge (poetics) gear you are God-like. Granted, there are pluses, like gathering/crafting.
---
But it's EASY. TOO EASY. And ridden with QoLs. And there is ZERO immersion in FF. Half the time is spent looking at loading screen whenever you change a zone, travel to a capital city, starting or handing in quests. useless cinematics 50 times a day.
---
FF is a slight better BfA, in some parts.
---
But overall, it's shit...at best.
---
But Dungeon Finder was only added towards the end of WotLK right?
---
Gnomes and Taurens have already been verified as the correct size by Blizzard in a [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887/18).
---
Same. Wrath is kind of a distant third for me, though. I feel like each raid tier in BC was great, and each one in Classic was at least good. For Wrath, the Naxx tier was too easy and the TOTC tier was garbage, but then Ulduar and ICC were 2 of the best raids they've made so it's a mixed bag.
---
No beta or stress test for me so I’m going about as fresh as possible. 
---
I stopped playing in mid MoP and haven’t leveled a character from zero since the beginning of Wrath. There are so many zones and dungeons that I have only vague memories of. Couldn’t be happier for Classic to come out.
---
&gt;I mean... if they're already detrimental to the current game.
---
Wait, did you just brush off my personal experience for being a personal experience and then enter in your own as objectivity?
---
Point being is that I, who plays a fuck ton of retail, would have never known the two "biggest" streamers of wow were on the same server that I play on. That is why I am asking how they are detrimental to the server based on your comment. This isn't an attack on you or your opinion, it was a serious question.
---
At least it's self-aware lol
---
"Reduces your chances of getting laid by 99%"
---
It embraces how cringy it is
---
The idea of conversing with RP nerds turns me away, but the prospect of endlessly ganking them peaks my interest.
---
But you can afk auto-run while you make yourself a sandwich or take a dump.
---
This is such a blessing
---
Right? Once AQ hits people will be bringing out their in-town clothes again. The only difference between that and transmog is that you had to carry them around with you, and people did.
---
Ugh what a fun instance. ZF has to be one of my favorites. In vanilla it was one of the first dungeons that made me really fall for this game. Before, I’d just been leveling because my roommate was playing. Then we hit this stair fight and my whole mindset changed.
---
The struggle is real, I'm jealous you've narrowed it down to two classes, AND picked your faction.
---
I have no problem picking for other people however, you shall be a troll mage!
---
Not experienced enough to know it doesn't happen in combat, though?
---
&gt; And the release of classic is gonna make his first full year as CEO look stellar - almost as if he planned it. People who rag on him/blizzard for what he said are more than happy to fork over 180 dollars a months for a game they developed and released 15 years ago.
---
 We've been here already. r/wow got their pitchforks because "he ruined the SWG" and didn't even listen to developer of SWG who came to say that is not true, and that Brack left because others started derailing SWG into ruins.
---
There's still good in it, I can feel it!
---
Ya a few guys would think we were bullshitting them when we talked about parry-haste. Some antsy folks felt tanks are just control freaks or something, but a lot of our pet peeves have reasons for existing.
---
I don't think it will destroy BFA at all. The players who are playing and enjoying BFA will continue to play and enjoy BFA. They'll log in, do what they need to, and maybe check out classic on the side. Even with layering, starting areas are going to be terrible starting out anyways. People will check it out and pop back over.
---
This is it for me. I wouldn’t mind seeing the class balancing and such put into Classic later, especially as I believe they were planned for vanilla but simply delayed since TBC was coming soon.
---
I do not want to see flying or moving the main action completely elsewhere, killing the original main cities.
---
it was added with ToC i believe. But my point was Wotlk was the beginning of the turn. Daily Hotspots became more of a thing, and the QoL tools started. The catch up systems also seemed a lot easier. I remember coming back after quitting during launch, only to gear up in 2 weeks and was able to start ICC at launch.
---
Apologies meant windfury
---
So profound.
---
&gt;This is what all power progression is ultimately
---
I don't speak for everyone but most people I play with gear up their character so they can be better at pvp. In classic we will raid MC to get better gear to pvp in phase 2 and to be able to clear BWL to get even better gear to pvp with in phase 3 and so on and so on. 
---
If blizzard released a new instance after naxx that didn't drop any direct power upgrades then guilds would clear it once for novelty then quickly stop.
---
Hehehehe
---
Spamming frost bolt is the whole reason I have my doubts about rolling one. I always play healer and though I would "change it up" but that sounds sooooo bad
---
Well to be fair in TBC you didn’t get flying until after you had hit 70, and most people only had the slow flying mount for a very long time, the epic flying mount cost an insane amount of money. The slow flying mount I believe had only a 60% speed modifier, which in a straight line made it slower than an epic ground mount.
---
You obviously didnt play a Mage then
---
Before you could queue for BG's in capital cities there were 60-80 man raids on capital cities fairly frequently. So stuff like this in terms of size did happen with regularity and sharding/layering is going to quite possibly make that impossible.
---
I will play both. :)
---
This guy is in full BiS and with world buffs on. You can't count on world buffs in Classic consistently.
---
So maybe dps warrior is good in full gear(!) and with world buffs, but what do you do if you wipe 1 time and lose your buffs? "Sorry guys now I can't dps properly."
---
This is what I did.
---
Are you implying that $150 would only be a sub for the beta and not carry over to live? In realistic terms, I would be paying $45 for 3 months of entertainment leading up to the release date. Well worth it.
---
Gona delete the post. I just semi-confirmed this with my guy. Apparently it's not a wave, but employees are getting some more personal invites to hand out to friends and family. Maybe if you are lucky you will get in. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/OWX26cG
---
You make the gear you're wearing look like gear you've collected in the past. For instance, all of the ugly tier 16 or whatever can be made to look like I'm walking around in Devout (tier 0).
---
The only way you can feel OG in BFA is having something that is not obtainable anymore, like PVP titles. I subbed back to wow (for a shot at beta, yeah I know... and to see the state of the game after 9years) and it's not the greatest of achievement but I ALWAYS run around with my Knight-Captain title.
---
Seems like over-catering to me. Pretty much anything that makes the game overly convenient is a detriment imo. It's a slippery slope. People really can't be asked to carry gear with all the huge bags in live WoW? Pretty sure we have more bag space than the bank slots I used to have. I totally don't view it as "excessive realism" to have to keep track of gear pieces and carry them. I don't mind these conveniences in the live game, but I hope that classic forks away from all the needless conveniences. Keep one version hardcore and the other convenience-driven. I'd be okay if transmog and heirlooms were *never* added to classic, even if we eventually get later expansions. I'll likely lose that battle, but it's the way I feel nonetheless. 
---
Personally, i'd prefer a forked timeline with a voting system similar to OSRS. That way the hardcore crowd doesn't eventually have to return to private servers.
---
I still remember how I got the epic 2h Sword (i think its name was Nightblade) from a random trash and won it.
---
Do we already know how much armor the raid bosses will have?
---
I mean it could make playing fury warrior pretty annoying because you COULD do tons of damage but are threat-capped all the time.
---
Some of the heroics were a little difficult before you got gear, but for the most part Cata PvE content was a faceroll, even the heroics.
---
What about class saturation though? If you have too many mages and warriors, you're never going to gear them up, and badly geared mages and warriors do not outperform geared hybrids. Plus, there is a fair amount of hybrid loot that drops in MC &amp; BWL, especially for Shamans that will be essentially wasted. You're also underestimating the utility that hybrids bring.
---
Raid quality is really tier dependant. Nobody hated firelands, every body hated toc and nax revamp. True for the 10 man thing though.
---
How about you go erect more eyesores on perfectly pristine hills.
---
It’s going to take everything I’ve got to not pull all of them the first few times I run it. 
---
Dungeon finder has ruined my patience as a tank.
---
Did someone link the table for glancing blow % vs. weapon skill?  I had thought I saw a table that mimicked pservers: 95% glancing blow damage at 310 weapon skill?
---
That has nothing to do with the kids fighting for their opinion?
---
You should not be mocking someone else if you can't take it yourself
---
Unsure if you knew this, as it wasn’t brought up elsewhere, but I noticed your Paladin was BE. There isn’t a Horde Paladin in Classic/vanilla, and no BE’s, so your faction may also determine your class (or your class determine your faction).
---
Yep this
---
That looks fun.
---
this is why my other half prefers to level alone, she kills fast enough and isn't waiting on people, more often than not she will out level most in her guild, with new expansions i will normally pull an all nighter to get level cap but for classic i think i will just go at a good pace, i'm in no rush its not like i have to be ready for the next expansion just the next phase which wont be too hard
---
Well was responding to your point - why is it skin off your nose if someone wants to look consistent or nice or however they look, regardless if they, heh, 'earned' that gear.   Desire for elitism on your behalf ?
---
&gt; I do not want to see flying or moving the main action completely elsewhere, killing the original main cities.
---
Same, i do love outland tho. Maybe if they open up the dark portal earlier and add a zone or 2 (they do have all of these ogres that were supposed to come from another continent in draenor).
---
And maybe never add flying to azeroth and take certain things out of shattrath. Like maybe leave it as a rep hub, altho now that i think about it shattrath was never really that crowded?
---
Transmog is such a weird thing to me. I tend to disagree with the #nochanges crowd a lot of the time and am far from a vanilla purist. I think there are some QoL changes that would make the game much better. The thing is that I very much agree that transmog ruins a big appeal in vanilla wow.
---
I honestly can't think of any reason why I would hate transmog that doesn't sound dumb once I write it down, it's really a "you had to be there" kind of thing. I can't explain what it was about seeing decked out players and kinda being in awe of them and also rooting for underdogs in mismatched garbage, but there is just something so satisfying and immersive and fun about people visually showing their power level and spec as they run around the world. 
---
The only problem is that it's not fully fleshed out in vanilla. Many classes don't use their full sets at any point in end game, and the gear that's out there sometimes doesn't go well visually with other gear you have to pair it with to optimize your character. So you have guys that are actually decked out in gear and insanely strong looking less put together and badass than someone in their blue dungeon set. If the system was a little better implemented, it would be perfect.
---
Either way, id take a slightly flawed awesome system over a better implementation of a worse system (transmog) any day. I am far from someone who cares about the way my character looks, but the thought of getting a full raid set together on one of my classes and achieving that look is almost as appealing to me as the actual stats that come with it.
---
I still have the mount speed increase glove enchant. It’s just a piece of history :)
---
different Field of View setting  can create this illusion
---
But we have little choice lol
---
I was in ZF when I got my first invite to a guild. The guy that invited me told me about something called ventrilo, then asked for my phone number so we could get it set up.
---
Reluctantly I gave it to him, and my immersion into the game grew deeper and deeper, Vent became the default hangout - even if I wasn't playing the game.... Doing some homework for college? Yeah I'm on vent, chatting it up while I type a paper. Playing another game? Same thing, with my WoW homies, building the relationships and camaraderie through there - didn't even have to be part of the game, but it was part of the experience.
---
Thats against the ToS
---
I’ve deleted characters in the past because I was sick of questing in the barrens.
---
I wish you couldn't change the range you saw nameplates, makes wpvp way more interesting.
---
I heard it was a mount from alpha. I don't think anyone has actually seen one on live servers
---
It’s leather soooo no?
---
Watching my mate do this on his orc warrior in 2005 made 12 year old me beg my dad to get me a computer to start playing
---
Yep!
---
All pservers I know didn't change the mechanics of abilities. So the buffed version of Shield Slam should have been used from the beginning on all of them.
---
I am starting to think maybe i dislike flying cuz you can do it everywhere now. Maybe if it was unique to outland for some reason.

Same. As someone who is a veteran and played in vanilla but hasnt played much private servers or beta.. Im gonna go in relaxed and fresh without the mindset of min-maxing and rushing. 
---
Im gonna be flooded with "oh shit thats how it was, fuck yes!". 
---
Absurdly stoked.

I always hated hunters in PvP as a druid. Scare beast sucks hard...

Yeah right, except that they can do it 5 years later where they can clear said content by auto attacking

Where can I get this? Asking for a friend.
---
I understand your POV now. I still don't interpret the OP the same as you, but I understand your POV
---
I'll stick with my given name from the DAoC random name generator.
---
while leveling you need on items that helps you level. Need if you need.
---
I've been saying for years WoW is the only thing that will kill WoW
---
BFA killed WoW for me, I have no interest in playing the rest of the expansion at this point.
---
Here's hoping they get classic right and it resurrects the game for me

I came to kill the boss, so that is not stealing in any way. I have the same right as him.  
---
I, however, sent him an invite and he consciously declined it while standing on the same spot. 
---
Only as I was lucky enough to get the boss first, he decided to invite me without any whisper as well.  
---
If his behavior is concidered okay and I am an asshole from your PoV, then I see what's going to be wrong in vanilla — such people as you are.
---
I like how the hoodie still says it’s a t shirt and not a hoodie lol
---
Yeah, WoW is great and full of opportunities.
---
I'm happy to hear that, see you in a big adventure :)
---
... Rogues / mages / warlocks / hunters don't do damage?
---
He is an optimist.
---
I prefer TBC to any other expansion.
---
I hated the Wailing Caverns.  Place was massive, a lot of twist, and even an area at the end where you needed to make a jump.  I don't think any other instance in WoW was there a platforming area, but there was in WC.  So many people would miss the jump, or many people will miss the jump twice.  And fall didn't kill you, but the run back up top was pretty long... in which case, many times, things would respawn and your party would get split.
---
Don't Trolls eat dwarves?
---
wowhead came out near the end of vanilla so it is not a good resource for when things first appeared during vanilla.
---
I agree lol. But would you trust Blizzard enough to rebalance itemization?
---
I think your problem is that you can transmog gear from 4-5 expansions worth of soloable content.
---
If I am a warrior in full T3 and I want to transmog to T2, what is wrong with that?
---
It would be cool if you could only transmog gear that you received when the content was current.
---
Same for me mate, I stopped playing towards the end of Cata, but me and buddies are all starting back up again for classic, we can’t wait man.. been so long since I heard that mulgore and barrens music, I’m getting tingles just thinking about it
---
Asmon continually has over 40k people watching him. Let's just assume that a small fraction of them want to play on his server.
---
Can you imagine the amount of servers he could possibly fill with his viewers alone? Or the extreme faction imbalance potential.
---
It really will affect the server he is on. If he ever decides to roll on another server, POOF! There goes potentially thousands of players. 
---
This is just a hypothetical but I can understand people feeling worried about it.
---
You can't really play Arms, because MS is occupying a debuff slot and thus costing your raid a lot of dmg unfortunately.
---
My main is lvl 90 ATM and alt 85, I remember doing a bit of arena then quit the game. I am playing a Human mage right now because I know that I am going to roll Dwarf rogue, so I will go fresh in the dwarf zone because I never played one EVER XD
---
you could do it but people normally didn't as you couldn't complete the quests in there and the xp drop was painful if you were trying to level, and normally people didnt do low level dungeons for the loot as you would just out level it too soon, unless it was for a twink
---
Really? Wait... so... is Brack not a game killer at all? Is he a silent hero that defended LFD/LFR because he was forced to? Is he actually the hero who revived Classic?! Would be awesome if thats true. But honestly i dont care. All i care about is beeing able to play vanilla wow again!
---
TBC raids were the bomb, but overall experience i think the class uniqueness of vanilla is a great quality no other expansion has.
---
It will be slow. 
---
This comes to mind - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKqNt5ysq4
---
TFW warriors selfishly want fury tanking to be the meta no matter what, so they can be everything at once.
---
It will be, a little increase in parry chance isn't going to change anything for the top dogs they will just heal through the extra damage like always.
---
If that druid is feral then I, personally, would let the druid have it. I would also let a hunter have it if he needed it. As a warrior you have mail and plate items that you're able to wear.
---
While it would also benefit you based on stats, it's a huge benefit to them. 
---
If you're running prot I absolutely would not take it. Also, if you're no-life'ing the game I would leave it as you'll likely replace it easily anyway once you gain a couple levels.
---
Last night on the stress test, when you got capped at level 10. You can turn in quests and they were like 25s, so at least on the latest stress test the answer was yes.
---
i for one am really hoping for a TBC esque expac, not straight up as it was but maybe outland with extra zones, less exp from quests, etc.
---
Also not specific to a TBC expac, but never add flying to Azeroth
---
I always ran in on my prot/holy pally and pulled everything and consecrated. The AoE would fly, but nothing could pull aggro off me. Then we just stand around waiting for the next round of mobs.
---
Using anything else than a 1.3 speed weapon on Vael makes no fucking sense!? What does that have to do with how many damage the tanks are taking?
---
Good point. That reduces 2H usefulness even more.
---
For the dungeons around 30 and under I'd say the best for me is probably SFK. Deadmines is pretty fun and has the good VC and defias story, I just haven't run it much since I don't play alliance all that often. I'm not a huge fan of the WC story with the leaders of the fang or the look of the place, though it's probably the low level dungeon I've run the most. 
---
I'd agree that Gnomer is the worst of them. It's a cool idea, just feels like it was quite fleshed out enough.
---
See this part I keep hearing but i'm super super skeptical about. I know on private servers it was possible, but when I raided in vanilla there was no way it was possible. The tanks were getting hit way too hard and needed the extra protection and cooldowns for survival. 
---
This is one of those things that we will have to wait and see tbh. I'm not saying that it's not possible and that we weren't dumb back then but there were TONS of theory crafting sites back then too with min/maxing. I have a feeling this could be chalked up to private servers getting it wrong.
---
If anything the beta has shown me so far, private servers up to level 30 are so far off on so many things that it's staggering. We will have to wait and see how raids are and class performance.
---
In my opinion, yes. At a low level like that, the stats is what matters most over "the type of armor" chances are in deadmines you have missing items from your gear list, whites, maybe a grey item, and some level 6-8 boe greens from hogger and random drops. you get HP from the stamina, you get attack power, crit chance, and defensive stats from the agility and str which is all helpful for tanking. it wasn't until cata where you got "Armor Specialization" like if you were a warrior if you had all plate armor you got extra stats from equipping all plate armor. Hell, even in WOTLK warriors BIS items some were leather because of the agility, crit, and armor pen rating on them.
---
Yeah, if it's an upgrade while leveling, need it.... hell if I want to disenchat the item and the person who might need it has a better piece I'm gonna need.
---
And why do you care that people what armor to look like the actual armor they are wearing? Both point are equally stupid and valid at the same time
---
And one some people can play for 12 hours a day while others can play for 5 hours a week. What kind of reasoning is that?
---
Sounds like when you cum inside your girl but scream your side chicks name. Great finish, but be sure you're dead after.
---
k. So it takes 2 hours to have the best weapon for 8 levels (fuck a 0.3% world drop) and a top 3 weapon for another 5. Wooooooooow so much time investment. 
---
Also, you're nuts if you think you wont find 3-4 other pallys from about 18-20 that want this quest lol
---
Everyone's gunna have their own answer to this. Warriors taking leather before 60 is kinda shitty, because you have a lot more access to str/stam gear than we druids do. Just randomly rolling on it would be a dick move imo.
---
However if you were rocking like a grey garbage chest and asked if it was okay to need (it being a massive upgrade) I probably wouldn't mind.
---
Omg yes.  That was freaking rage-inducing.
---
Did you speak about LFD/LFR in previous comment? No.
---
So why the hell did you bring it up? You asked about SWG, I answered about SWG.
---
I remember the rumours about GM Island, Dev Island, Coder zone, the White room (aka player prison) and another place that you could get teleported too that it's just void.
---
Back in Vanilla I was able to visit GM Island once by using a model exploit, and a friend of mine got teleported into the void place.
---
Feign death doesn’t work in bgs or in dungeons.
---
Lol bro an increase in parry chance for raid bosses isn't going to completely blow up the meta druids will still be able to tank raid bosses they will just require more healing focus.
---
They said they will be doing cross realm bg queues, but dont expect enough servers for seperate battle groups.
---
&gt; This was just built on during WOTLK and typically why WOTLK is in a different class than BC and vanilla.
---
Dungeon finder made grouping up easier, but also allowed for heroics to be done multiple times. I dont remember if the bosses would drop tokens still, but the Dungeon finder would reward the prior tier token. I geared up so fast in wrath. I would say this is when upgrades felt less important, because they were garaunteed
---
In the gnome start area the rabbits are skinnable. Is this a bug?
---
https://i.imgur.com/zCIoRhN.jpg
---
Here’s why I enjoy classic so much. If that warrior does, then he’s not getting invited to groups by everyone else in that party. 
---
Let the Druid have it, for sure.
---
but the stress test had layering... so obviously its working as intended in that respect. and the classic devs, who are fixing bugs already, have literal months to fix the exploits
---
Look , random invite without chatting up first is kinda rude in any mmo..
---
should ask him if he want to group up instead of sending unwanted group invite.
---
back in vanilla WOW 2015 the only ones sending unwanted invites are gold farmers or scammers
---
from my perspective it is you that at fault for sending invite without chatting up first..
---
"classic will bring back cooperation" is true , if you bother to ask him first , politely
---
I was on an RPPVP server, and I hardly ever saw anyone RP’ing that wasn’t a guy and gal avatar sitting in some romantic spot, or an occasional guild meeting in some tavern or castle or something done in an RP style. (Oh, and those people in the train tunnel between SW and IF, if one considers that RP.) About 99% of general chat either in channels or out loud was not done in an RP fashion.
---
Most ‘RP’ I encountered was getting ganked by a higher level, which I couldn’t understand if they said anything after but on the forums such ganking was justified as ‘but its RP! Faction wars!’
---
In my personal experience, I just consider RPPVP to be another PVP server with a bit stricter naming policies and a very occasional RP guild.
---
I'm not sure if you read the first statement and then stopped but the poster addressed that line of reasoning in their initial post. And even if they didn't, to say 'the stupidity of that statement' is just an asshole move. People claim this community is toxic, you're not doing them any favors.
---
The environment at 60 really isn't that much different than what we see at the artificial cap. You swap out the dungeons they've been running for newer dungeons to get BiS. After you get into raids, you continue that path again. There's more carrots and larger sticks but people losing steam at 30 is a pretty good indicator at what will happen to the community as a whole. It booms, it tapers out, it settles.
---
Im implying that your willing to spend 150 bucks on something that you would not have normally got, in order to temporarily play a old game which is coming out in 3 months anyway. 
---
It doesn't matter if your an adult with the finances to do it or a kid with his moms credit card, its a pretty stupid idea and just throwing money away because you have no patience.
---
Druid, rogue, hunter, shaman. Doesn’t matter if the warrior is gonna wear it and it’s an upgrade why shouldn’t he be able to need?
---
Not to mention that the defias chest is a great tank piece for warrior anyways.
---
Thats pretty much every vanilla pvp video, especially the famous ones.
---
Hi, /u/Pmmepix
---
Used the bestiary by braddygames to check, all is fine
---
Its just gear
---
Ettiquette  says that you roll need on the role you playing in that instance.
---
E.g. a druid healer in that instance at that moment, should  ask before rolling need on that. Kitty and bear druid would just roll need. Rogues and hunters at that level would just roll need.
---
Warriors and Pallies should ask before rolling need.
---
Deadmines is one of my favorites of all time. But fuck BFD. I almost always skip it. Too much swimming. And I have aqua form.
---
In that case, why not just keep playing the version of the game that has those things?
---
In Mulgore I noticed it while doing the quest "Mazzranache", everytime one of the quest items dropped I couldn't skin the wolf/strider/cougar afterwards, even though I was not in a group and I completely looted the mob.
---
&gt; They're both going to exist side by side and the deficiencies of Retail are going to be far more readily apparent. 
---
This is the reasons why Retail will die. Not because Classic will have more players at launch (which it will, by far)...but because AFTER launch, more and more Retail players will "migrate" to Classic.
---
It's just inevitable. All the QoL's in retail won't make up for the dull and meaningless Retail content, especially when Classic is at a click distance (and not an additional sub).
---
Most players will realize that they are $15 / month for 2 games...and one is far better designed than the other.They will choose where they spend their TIME, because the MONEY is spent regardless.
---
Lol
---
And the ancient leaf quest.
---
yes , the OP seem oblivious to that fact , that an unwanted group invite from non friend or non guildie is very impolite. 
---
or he is habituated by retail WOW so much that he think chatting up people before invite is unnecessary..
---
the OP is the one at fault and should re-learn how to be polite in MMO
---
It will take most of the player base more than 2-3 years to be at this point. Which if there is demand for it I bet we get BC servers then Wrath servers 3 years after that. 
---
Remember less that 1% ever killed a single boss in Naxx. What was it like less than 1,000 players ever full cleared Naxx before BC. Gearing up in each tier took Months not weeks like it does now. Grand Marshall meta will be neat to see late in classics life cycle. 
---
Point is it’s years away. No point in hashing it out now.
---
Literally everyone.
---
Cata actually had diificult raids and dungeons not sure why you're hating on it.
---
The hive mind is always right...
---
'Keeping the good stuff and "fixing" the bad'.
---
Problem is what are the good stuff from each iteration and what are bad?
---
In my eyes tbc was already going shit with the exception of raid designs, and the only good thing about wrath being the northrend continent.
---
But im sure everyone would feel differently.
---
The pattern is full.
---
Yeah tbh it was a long time ago.. I feel that only raiding needed the full prot spec. I know people will argue with me about how private servers they are tanking through naxx as non prot but I know that back in vanilla our off tanks were doing the same and got stomped fast the second they had to take over.
---
It's either one of those things that private servers got way off or we were just dumb back then. There was a lot of material back then too though and tons of min/max sites. We had to watch videos of every fight before we attempted them and those videos were out within a day of the new content. I can't remember if elitestjerks was back then but I do recall a site similar if not the same was a big source of min/max that we used back then.
---
:)
---
About halfway through. That was my peak time in WoW. The difference in socialization between the day before and the day after introduction was night and day. Truly the worst thing Blizzard ever did to WoW.
---
Incidentally there was an LFG tool, that dated back to TBC IIRC, already in the game at that point. But it was not cross-realm and it didn't assemble the group for you. It just showed a list of players looking for the same dungeon as you. No-one used it.
---
Be happy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hRu-4uFkoByzyhcjdngyyuvgXt9EhEZfEKkPHO_i9Ts/edit#gid=295564743
---
Just bought the game, came here to say this.
---
Hmm... you’re not overweight and there are no week-old McDonald’s cups in the background. This must be fake.
---
You can see from the answers why issues on this arise. 
---
Personally I feel if a Warrior rolled need on that with a Druid in the group he is being pretty selfish.
---
Bruh
---
Cool story bro
---
Why i brought LFD/LFR up? Because those rumors on the internet say that he made SWG (jedi) way easier so the asumption isnt far off for him to defend lfd/lfr right? But if those rumors are just rumors... maybe he isnt as bad as we all thought and you might misunderstood my post there so dont get angry plz\^\^
---
Maybe he will turn Blizzard around and MAYBE he was the reason Classic got a thing at all? Who knows. Future will tell if we should hate or love him.
---
godsend
---
They do it so that the 25+ dps in the raid can go balls to the wall and not worry about threat, there's literally nothing selfish about it lol
---
I feel like you need more comprehensive math than "more boss parries = more tank parries" to conclude anything. That's like saying one car will be faster than another because one has more horsepower. That's not precisely how things work, it's just an indicator or a variable for car performance.
---
With a setup like that you're basically covering everything. No reason to pick up leatherworking since no rogues, druids, or hunters in that 3, so you got all your basis' covered with professions. Enchants, bags, flasks, potions, and gear. The only thing is most paladins want to roll engineering for leveling and pvp just because engineering gives paladins more chances to slow, snare, and stun enemies since paladins don't have much to use on those classes that slow and run away from you while you're struggling to keep up and move. But the most common alternative for paladins is def alchemy. Even at the end if you swap skinning and mining for eng and blacksmithing you can still make a lot of gold from BRD, and DME runs.   
---
It'll also be easier for your son to level tailoring and enchanting (In my opinion enchanting is one of the most expensive to level) because you can just throw him all of your cloth from dungeons and leveling.
---
I think that Wrath is a distant third, but BC and Vanilla occupy a similar place in my heart. Vanilla was amazing for all the reasons that have already been established. BC addressed many of the class balance issues that plagued vanilla and really gave every single class an opportunity to shine. In BC you could literally play ANY spec you wanted and find a place in a raid.  
---
However BC also introduced a few problems of its own and started the slow inexorable decline of the game into what it is now.
---
well just because i like the feeling of achievements doesn't mean I think they're important enough for me to keep them from enjoying classic
---
it is called communication and being polite.. it is something that lost to  the retail WOW players .. it is something that commonly done in Vanilla WOW .. 
---
it is called being a polite social player in an MMORPG and treating other players nicely
---
That's not because Warrior DPS was bad, it's simply because literally nobody knew Fury DPS was actually good until people started trying it in Naxx. Fury Warriors were literally a meme until ones that finally started getting gear after the Arms Warriors already had it were allowed to DPS for the lulz and then topped the meters. People literally didn't know Fury did good DPS until Naxx was already cleared.
---
An expac that takes TBC and makes a fun set of of zones to get to the next level cap in azeroth would be the best thing. 
---
I feel they can add something similar to mythic +, but without raid level rewards.
---
I for one think they should go a new route after classic, release a Dark portal themed expac, but its jsut different, maybe illidan never over through magtheridon, make the leveling harder with an extra zone or 2 as well.
---
Then after that we go back to azeroth, but now its a south sea's expac add a bunch of isles but players can also get around via boats. I am actually suprised Blizz never capitalised on boat travel
---
I agree 100%. Keep leveling a compelling experience and you won't have to add bandaid fixes like heirlooms. To me, character progression at a glance is a million times more valuable than aesthetic customization. Function over looks.
---
I also selfishly hate it pulling my friends away from doing the stuff I want to do. "Wanna come farm ICC for the 1000th time to get rare drops?!" Then I just log off. I'd rather just play another game than spend hours on aesthetic farming. I'd often just fish and wait around for them to finish. Yeah, I can find another group to hang out with that has my interests, but they really were a fun group of people to hang out with when they weren't wasting time farming transmog. 
---
I just have absolutely no interest in playing a game that has it at this point. If they ever add it to the classic fork I will probably return to private servers. I have 0 objection to paying Blizzard $15, so I don't do it because the game is free. I just like everything to be hardcore and focused on objectives. If I want to play dress up I will get on the Sims 2.
---
I hope that if they ever do add transmog they at least make it an option that I can check off in my interface settings. That way people can look how they want and I can see them for what they are actually wearing. I don't even care if it's on by default, since it's just the hardcore want gear accuracy. Everyone wins.
---
Level 1 weapon training has been active throughout the Beta, not just the Stress Test. What makes you think they will change that on launch?
---
Classic isn't like retail, there is no loss of stats for using other armor types, only a bit of armor, sometimes gear stats make up for that loss of armor. (espceially if the correct armor your actually wearing is so old  that the new leather, has more armor than the chain mail you currently have equipped)
---
1) Depends on class and race. For a troll hunter: 2 hours 45 minutes. 
---
2) Yes. Has anyone written it down and posted it publicly? Probably not.
---
Hi, /u/rackflowseidon
---
OP seems to find that damaging to the game or that people doing so aren't "real players" (whatever the hell that means).
---
From a die hard pvpers perspective;
---
MoP &gt; WoD &gt; Vanilla &gt; BC &gt; Wrath &gt; Legion &gt; BFA
---
Dont get why people make this pointless statement. Shamans have tranquil air totem that reduces threat.
---
Super simple. If it is an upgrade. Even by a point... need dat bish
---
Mara is one of the best crafted dungeons in the game. I fucking loved that shit
---
while i don't particularly like most streamers, so are really good and help the community a lot, i don't think any will impact the game enough to hurt it, they may cause 1 or 2 servers to become heavily one sided but on the whole they are not going to be on every server so just find one that's right for you and any friends you are playing with and go there, that's what i plan to do
---
Try out Dauntless. Its free now
---
&gt; only one of the two products provides their corporate overlords with a massive chunk of up-front cash every 2 year
---
...for now...
---
I tried private servers, but the experience was always buggy and a ton of hackers stuff like that. So I never pushed hard on them, there is a LOT of terms that I am not aware of and that are totally new to me.
---
Min-maxing for example, BiS (I learn what it means two days ago), spell batching (I played a rogue and a mage for fun)?
---
Like always some peoples will go insane on grinding optimizing everything super fast. Sad to say that I am not 21 anymore and I have more responsibilities now. So I will take my time like day 1 in 2004, exploring and testing stuff :)
---
Meh
---
Does this confirmation make weapon skill racials more important?
---
That max camera distance change command is very much appreciated sir. Thank you.
---
The point would be that the druid only has the option for leather, while I get the warrior would technically be an upgrade on gear, it’s should only be allowed if you ask the Druid first
---
No transmogs, it renders your efforts of obtaining better looking gear pointless. You can just unequip your T3 and equip your T2 if you want to wear it. Takes 30 seconds and you're gonna have that to spare as you'll be stood around a main city by that point I'd imagine.
---
Bats can’t learn claw :/
---
I think this is the biggest factor as to why they aren’t commonly used, as claw is the best focus dump. Bite + screech seems solid though. Maybe someone has the math somewhere on how much worse than bite + claw that combo is.
---
If you want to read why paladins are awesome
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/budyuk/the_best_reason_to_play_a_paladin_2005/
---
I miss when trinkets were goofy little items that were all over the place. I'm not a fan of the retail design of them being the most important part of your DPS or something like that. They are just overpowered proc machines now.
---
You're sticking to the $150, whereas only $45 is what you would deem "throwing money away". But the intrinsic value of that money is for me to decide. And if I would get 3 months of entertainment for $45 is that not worth it? How many games have people bought for $60 and finished in a month only to never touch it again?
---
Ah, thats what it was.. 8% for abilities and 21% for auto attacks
---
That's kind of the point...  They will.    But they will still make a character on Classic, because it's "Free".
---
I practice need rolling for whatever you are using to support the group for the dungeon you’re in. 
---
However I will be going DPS to level on my warrior. And tanking dungeons as DPS with a shield on for bosses. 
---
I will be need rolling DPS and Tank gear, if anyone doesn’t like that they don’t need to come I guess? 
---
I’ll also be providing a healer and DPS players too so we will only be pugging 1 or two people. Probably looking for Rogue and maybe a hunter or Druid 
---
I plan to make a spam macro to let joiners be aware. 
---
I think that’s fair?
---
End game is different though. For raids I say it’s just your main spec
---
yeah some ppl hate BFD and it is one of the earlier dungeon that cause party break up.. but oh gosh nothing beat gnomer as one dungeon that people hate so much back then
---
I was wondering about that as I typed my previous post, if they opened the content but limited the services available in the Outlands, to encourage people to go there for content but come back to main world for big city amenities/conveniences.
---
And take out flying, of course.
---
But if they do a TBC server, Blizz won’t change it, and some proponents of TBC won’t want it changed the way we don’t want Classic messed with too much.
---
Hey man just wondering if you've been invited into the beta yet? Your UI addon looks amazing! Would love to use it at launch.
---
An idea I keep tossing around: 1-60 normal, outdoor content, then a separate 1-10 for each expansion. In current WoW, you could get to 60, then head straight to BfA to do it's 1-10. Or if you wanted, you could head to Northrend to do the WotLK 1-10.
---
Once an expansion becomes non-current, it becomes part of "Veteran Content". If you complete a previous expansion's pathfinder achievements, whether live or previous, you gain a stack of a Veteran buff (say +1% to primary stats) that is toggle-able and only works in non-current content. You can gain one extra stack of this by completing an expansion's raid content, but you have to complete the raids with the veteran buff turned off. This would drive groups to still form for old content, and allow us to potentially be strong enough to solo power stomp through previous raids if we so choose.
---
Gear from each area would perhaps be stronger than gear from the 1-60 zones, but current expansion gear would have some sort of attunement or gimmick to it that would make it what you need.
---
It's definitely not in the Classic spirit, but it would help prevent the need for numbers bloat, stat squishes, and scaling power up/down while allowing expansions to continue happening... it's at least the best compromise I can think of for MMO longevity.
---
Yeah I tries progressing after the kids expansion but eventually there were too many adds to manage.
---
To complicate things, loot during the wife expansion was no longer available unless I progressed further in the kid expansion.
---
gnomer is gigantic for it's level and the endless gnomes and their wonky 2 legged mount patrolling the dungeon with alarm bot calling up reinforcement is causing severe PTSD even now for me..

Without threatreduction talents as a druid healer this was a nightmare. Too many mobs to not aggro atleast 2 or 3 xD

Story of my life right now. Tried playing OSRS again but can't get into it. Hopping onto Mordhau once in a while but all I want is classic wow :(

Scary AF
---
You don't have to rp on a rppvp realm, but it's very welcomed if you do so. Just make sure you give your character a lore friendly name and don't interrupt other players who are actually rping. If you can do this you won't have any issues on rppvp servers.
---
Hunters also have disengage, and feign death is a 30 second CD. FD should be used on CD because of the reason of possible resists.
---
Holy crap
---
I would not expect this to happen in classic. I don't know the details surrounding that event, but that sounds like you may have just gotten lucky.

This is straight from the 1.12.1 client: [http://i.imgur.com/PxKWgdQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/PxKWgdQ.png)
---
8/3 = 2.6666667.
---
The mechanic is there, you can easily test it by the same method I did on vanilla servers.
---
On the private servers I've played its always been that first track you linked.
---
They already do, but they shouldn't be the only ones playing beta. You want players of every kind in a beta test to best cover everything.
---
The glancing blow percentage against enemies 3 levels higher than you is always 40% (!) and you can't push those off the tables.
---
Some guys already tested this in the beta and it behaves as expected there:

Helll no
---
Oh hey look!
---
Someone who wants to feel entitlement in a video game.
---
You are not owed anything for playing. That is all.
---
no the pet is stealthed with the hunter.. i used to gank hordes in STV by using stealth and tracking humanoids.. pretty fun romp until they called up lv60 friends
---
Hmm I could use the image everytime some idiot start ranting about layering
---
This is not really true, since a healer most often while leveling is just healing for the specific instance for the benefit of the group, and will need on leveling gear, same with tanks really
---
Dude i would ALWAYS miss at 99%!!!
---
Pretty sure its gonna be the 1.5+ version of it, since the game is based on 1.12
---
If you use Force on the truck, you'll get Mew.
---
Thanks for taking your time with this post, I think this sums up most of the other comments as well. It's a shame many people blame the streamer for the reposts and reaction videos out of his control (to some extent).
---
But all the things you say you love are what retail has been refined to dole out at the optimal rate. 
---
Classic simply isn't as good at those things. It never was, but that's part of what made it better at other things.
---
I remember getting the wolf helm from there on my hunter and thinking it was the coolest piece of gear
---
You would think so.... but across 5 druids in vanilla I never got that chest on a level appropriate druid.
---
And no one has every kicked a warror, or even the pally for taking it.. (Hey it's stam gear I need that).
---
&gt; This is just off the top of my head. I do think that an ideal version of WoW would mix and match select elements from each of these three expansions
---
I feel an outland themed expac would be great after classic, tweak the story slighttly to allow for shattrath merely to be a rep hub for the scryer and whomever, but never introduce sanctuary city status.
---
also lower exp gains from quests, and add a zone or two, i dont mind heroics, and flying so much IF they never add it to azeroth.
---
also increase the cost of token gear, so that people arent really making entire sets that negate the need to do raids. Make it something to maybe get different itemized stats, or just allow you to upgrade a slot that you havent gotten a raid drop for.
---
Idk how to fix the pvp, because TBC i feel was so balanced, because they never bothered to try and balance the high end pvp, maybe why they added resilience?
---
I do...we died....a lot
---
yep reading it to the end and yet the click baity title and the first massive paragraph reinforce the intention of the post that this is a troll post..

---
I don't really like it, because it would fuck over PvP.
---
Glancing blow percentage is actually 40% (see above), but you have to substract those 0.2% from the 8%, so instead of needing 8% hit on your gear to never miss a yellow hit, you would, theoretically, only need 7.8%.
---
You could say that if they were just releasing an old client like pservers run, but they've had to rebuild it using the current game engine.  Yes they have all the content already, but theres still a lot of work they're putting into recreating it.
---
That’s what I was thinking. We can just kick each other all the drops and mats and recipes that we run into along the way.
---
I've been doing 1-6 and 1-12 runs on a lot of characters on beta. I've noticed this also happening for mage spells (fireball and frostbolt damage slightly increases each level you gain) as well as druid (wrath and moonfire damage increases). I oddly noted that priest gains zero damage increase across all spells.
---
Perfection.
---
I believe there is a dev interview where they say that they are going to include Thorium Point at launch, because it is content that would have been there day 1 if it had been finished.
---
Very constructive my man.
---
&gt; it renders your efforts of obtaining better looking gear pointless
---
"Better looking gear" is not an objective thing.  If you think T2 looks better than T3, then what exactly are you rendering as useless?
---
WC is bad , not as bad as gnomer though , but yes that place is a maze for new players..
---
Good find. Keep up the testing!
---
Gnomer sucks if your group sucks, but if you have at least 1 person who knows where to go, and the rest of the group trusts them, then its fine.
---
You stated.. 
---
&gt;we have the financial wellbeing and security that dropping $150ish sub advancement on a game we already intend on playing longterm is not a big deal.
---
Which is why I have been saying, that 150 bucks for 3 months of playing a game in which your progress will get reset when the actual game comes out , is dumb.
---
Wrath was the peak of wow because a lot of hype had been built through all of TBC, and the Lich King cinematics. I think TBC was the expac that gained the most subscribers. Wrath may of had the most subscribers but thats not the only metric
---
Yeah for sure. If all 3 of you are playing and leveling together it'll truly be a blast, both dungeons, leveling, profit and professions.
---
 I'm trying to get my GF into playing so i'm not really going solo but I don't think that'll happen haha! Good Luck
---
trolling or? that shows AP from gear aswell
---
This is absolutely glorious
---
More mid-sized raid activities would be awesome. No 20 man raid parallel to Nax was a huge disappointment imo. You could have smaller casual guilds who can't field a full 40 and handle the length of AQ40 and Nax, but can still have a personal progression of ZG -&gt; AQ20 -&gt; Nax20.
---
No need to be sorry. There are some hunter pets that can stealth, specifically cats. I know I had one back in the day - named it Surprise.
---
Hi, /u/KindaActive
---
I love WC. The large, sprawling dungeons are one of my favorite parts of vanilla, and I love that you can access something like that early on in the game. Also lol@ people missing the jump; its dirt easy if you are actually paying attention.
---
The dungeon filled with boars and have a gigantic skeleton rave party , Razor Fen Kraul ? 
---
that place's fun but the loooong walk from theramore is painful
---
Imagine an imaginer imagining an imagination so imaginary that imagery was immaculate.
---
You still refuse to acknowledge that you didn't talk to the guy, at all.  It's why you're getting downvotes. Try it next time.
---
Because of all those proc effect in bfa you see 10dmg sources a second and you dont know what is caused by what. That results in not caring at all and you stop giving a shit and that results in not beeing that invested into the game. Blizzard turned Wow (an MMORPG) into a better version of Diablo 3 (MMO).
---
Seriously... you just cant call retail wow an MMORPG. It has more in common with D3 than a real MMORPG. Community in retail? Not there.. RPG? Not there Players around you? Start counting and where ever you go you see a bunch of NPCs but not as nearly as much players.
---
Vanilla WoW was about the World and the Player had the chance to be part of something bigger. Retail wow is all about the player... he is the hero no one needs or wants. He is the savior... or at least thats what the game wants to tell you but then you look around you and everyone else is a savior aswell... not that fun beeing a savior in a world were beeing a normie would be something special. Its like... having the Ashbringer in Classic... EVERYONE was look at you in awe... in Legion every paladin had Ashbringer and no one cared or gave a fuck.
---
Its funny how its way more enjoable to find white shoulders in Classic than getting a 425 epic in BFA.
---
Gameplay wise, BC was an upgrade from Vanilla's. Every spec was still an RPG spec, but they were all viables.   
---
Everything else was not an upgrade. Raids were downscaled to 25 man raid / 10 man raids. Flying mount destroyed the world ( the world did not felt huge anymore, world PvP was easy to escape ), confining the end game to Outland, which is instanciated from Azeroth was a big mistake.   
---
Increasing the level cap was an open door to power spikes.  
---
Generally speaking, the game was closer to retail when you hit 70, that it was on Vanilla.
---
False. Warlocks need rattlecage skulls for the imp. I had to kill 16 for 3 skulls while my friend got all 3 from just 3 rattlecage.
---
By the time we were both at Brill I had just short of 1g and he had about 60s, I was level 6 and he was 5. I had way more junk drop from mobs and 2 4 slotters while he barely had anything drop for him.
---
It's entirely possible to get more gold killing for more drops that aren't dropping.
---
Next.
---
Patchwerk doesn't parry haste lol
---
Don’t forget the mara scepter!
---
evasion, then vanish. dead healer. lol. tell them its fine you have jumper cables. rogue life.
---
Out of your descriptions, easily the mage.
---
Duel: rogue is more balanced with having fewer hard counters while not hard countering anything. Mage is less balanced, but overall just as strong.
---
BG: mage is one of the most sought after classes because of their cc, aoe cc, aoe damage and synergizing in group fights extremely well (several mages could sneak up to a raid and aoe them all  before they got to know it)
---
Gear: taste depending, I personally cant tell which one looks better for me.
---
Leveling: easily mage, but if it doesnt matter, who cares.
---
Popularity: rogue is going to be more popular and probably the most unwanted class in the game.
---
So from your criteria its the mage.
---
Full prot w. shield probably won’t even be considered viable after this because their TPS is going to be unacceptably low. Druids are going to rule T0/T1, fall behind a little in BWL, then surge back to the top for AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I'm doubtful it will happen in classic.  I ran both BRD and Sunken temple at least 20 times each on my project 60 character when using dungeon finder.  I saw at least 5 iron foes drop and just as many dragon's calls.
---
To give some context, I played at Vanilla Launch.  I easily ran BRD 100+ times and never saw Ironfoe drop.  The drop rates were most definitely boosted during the anniversary event.
---
Holy cow this is insane!
---
My motivation was knowing how much time I’m going to want to play, best for family if we can do it together. That way I don’t end up as a basement dweller.
---
"You think you do but you don't"
---
You are correct that you were always limited, but I’m saying it won’t be the end of the world as long as your tank is a competent one.
---
People seem to be misunderstanding my point. Threat will hold you back, but the amount of FPS that can be done is partially determined by the quality of the tanks. That is why I said it shouldn’t be a huge deal.
---
Your hybrids share gear with pure specs. They would never be more geared than a warrior, rogue or mage/warlock. 
---
Say I bring your balance Druid, he shares gear with healers and cloth casters. Your priority is still last in line, you would never have enough gear to out Dps a pre-raid bis Mage. 
---
Ret paladins share gear with warriors, why would I give a ret paladin gear over a warrior ever? So the ret paladin can be more geared so he can finally compete with a no gear warrior? Class saturation isn’t as big of a deal as you think, because hybrids still share gear with people.
---
Except shaman I guess? I have no idea about horde/shaman as I never played that side.
---
If I happened to recruit / steal a super geared Ret paladin or something from another guild, sure he can have a spot if he does more damage. However, I am not wasting our guilds gear on classes that are not as efficient as a warrior.
---
Hell yeah, I remember my friends judging me when I chose it over the 1h, but I loved the shit out of that sword!
---
I prefer BC personally, but it is miles better than WOTLK for sure. I quit before Cataclysm so I have no idea after that, but I hated WOTLK. If they ever make a BC server I will probably play both that and vanilla.
---
Oh god, I completely forgot about FTW... it was everywhere when I played.
---
You could argue OP is the autist for not bothering to talk to the guy and say why he's there and why he wants to group. Aren't autistic people the ones who have a hard time with social norms, manners, and relating to people? My god.

&gt; But if they do a TBC server, Blizz won’t change it, and some proponents of TBC won’t want it changed the way we don’t want Classic messed with too much.
---
Idk there seems to be 2 movements now in my eyes, people who want WoW to go back to more desireable MMORPG aspects, and people who want to play the old games again.
---
I feel it would be better for everyone if blizzard just adopted more TBC and Classic philosophies designing new content and paths for after classic. 
---
If they go the other route, sure people would play the hell out of TBC. But after that its all downhill, then they are getting into a period where the games core elements begin to change, thus losing the main group supporting the classic movement
---
You wont get any effort of blizzard creating anything new for this wave of reused content. You can knock that out of dour head very quick. They are all about thr money and they will definitly not add another 1000 employees to their roster just to make money off of the same people that would might aswell play TBC.
---
That's not true, many items stay on your character through levelling, the DM chest can last up to lvl 30/35 on a rogue, it's not that hard to see lvl 55ish people running around still using SM gear.
---
The power creep through expacs, though, they're extreme and it's not that difficult to replace your hard-earned mace in Molten core with a greenie from the first 3 quests of Outlands
---
&gt; sub advancement 
---
I'd still have 9 months of game time. Just because I bought 3 months of game time to play a beta, doesn't make the latter 9 months disappear. I'm paying 3 months subscription to play 3 months of beta, and have 9 months of game time after. I don't understand how this is hard to grasp.
---
In TBC it was unique to Outland.  It’s been a while but I don’t think you got flying in Azeroth until Cata.

What's ahead of its time? You don't think people had a sense of humor 15 years ago? George Bush was president...
---
You are not getting forty more silver from killing thirteen more mobs at *level fucking three*. Unless items vendor for more than on private servers or mobs drop more money in general, anyway.
---
Oh god I forgot about tokens and such. Definitely another system I disliked.
---
But one of my biggest problems with BC (and the general formula that all expansions bar Cata followed) was that they focused exclusively on late-game play and content. Instead of expanding on options for the early- and mid-game experience, they made it easier to "skip", then dumped all the high level players in a new continent and left everything that came before practically empty.
---
The social impact of having high and low level players sharing the same space cannot be overstated.
---
Yep new PoE league will carry me for a bit, maybe checkout 8.2 if it looks any good, then classic will be out.

---
no, shamans are good targets for rogues, because they don't have blink or fear or stun.  Also, resto shamans will be key healers to slay for the rogues to win a team fight.  Enhancement shamans don't have that much armor or block since they have no shield.  Enhancement shaman are also trying to engage in melee, instead of kiting, so it kind of helps most classes to fight enhancement instead of other ranged or healer classes.  
---
I rerolled an orc after my tauren ended up being a prime target during AV battles.  You are just too tall and easy to pick out in comparison to other people around you.  War stomp was always on cooldown and I couldn't reliably get out with ghost wolf, so I would last ditch play fire nova, earthbind instead of trying to escape the swarming pack during war stomp.  The hardiness resisting stuns and allowing me to continue healing or dpsing was way better in pvp.  If you don't ever want to do BGs, then none of this conversation is relevant.
---
I think BC and Vanilla were both up there for me. Wotlk was great, too!
---
Fresh off the presses this one
---
I'm probably one of the biggest 'supporters' of Layering.  But it's not because I like it, or want it, or feel that it's Vanilla-like.  It sucks, and I wish it didn't exist.
---
But it's a necessary evil.  The launch of Classic is going to be unique.  It's not a vanilla-like experience, so it needs some non-vanilla solutions.  It is what it is.  And so I support it.

---
Thanks, I will do that.
---
the juxtaposition of your statement and your username amuses me
---
If it turns out to be the actual best approach, 100%. My worry is that people won't objectively analyze the problem because they want to be able to tank in DPS spec.
---
[full disclosure this was in TBC, but it's vanilla dungeons]
---
Worst : Running Scarlet Monastery when the tank didn't understand that you have to clear ALL THE TRASH before engaging Mograine. So they pulled him and we died PDQ. We rezzed and they started bitching that someone must have pulled the trash. As I am typing out that no we have to clear the trash first they pulled Migraine again. That's the only time I can recall simply abandoning a dungeon run.
---
Best: Tanking Blackfathom Deeps as enhancement shaman. Our tank dropped and we couldn't find another one. Someone suggested that I tank the trash while we waited. I suggested we should wait for a real tank when we got to the next boss. Group leader said I was fine and pulled in another DPS.
---
They did? Almost everyone whos in the beta is from like very early wow
---
P U R P L E
---
This is prolly an awful idea but what if we got a modified version of BC that would include/exclude:
---
* Level cap is still 60
---
* No flying mounts(can this work in Outlands?)
---
* All 25 man BC raids are 40 man and rebalanced(no one prolly wants this lol)
---
* Make gear more horizontally scaled which allows for more viable builds(BC sorta already did this)
---
* Only 2 of the raids would require progression from Naxx, with the 2nd raid require progression from the 1st. All other raid gear should be more horizontal progression for diversity/variety.
---
* No daily's ever, the feeling the you need to log on daily or you'll get left behind is terrible. Not to mention how annoying it is doing the same thing every day. 
---
My main goal here is to bring all the good parts from BC and it's content but without negating vanilla content and leveling experience. I'd rather limit the progression raids to 5-6 raids with other raids being filler in-between that offers gear to make numerous spec more viable and generally just horizontal progression.
---
Yeah.. this idea is terrible, not to mention, way to much work to make possible.
---
I only remember failing...I honestly can‘t remember clearing this once. Damn 😂
---
Of course its not just nostalgia. If you love MMORPGs than its clear that you would love Classic WoW. Why?
---
Because Classic WoW is a real MMORPG while retail wow is just a singleplayer themepark mmo with playerhubs. Retail is like Diablo 3 without loading screens between zones and here and there are some player hubs where you can meet other people.
---
Classic/BC/WotLK was the best MMORPG ever and retail ist the best MMO today. With Classic release Blizzard will have the best MMORPG and the best MMO in their arsenal.

Stealth runs into LBRS and BRD totally awesome. 2 druids and rogues. Farm any item you need from these places.

Entitlement in the video game? No. I don't want gold banners around my name is specific markings or tags. I've been playing since vanilla, as many of us have, and have signed up for beta every expansion and got nothing, whereas someone starting in Legion gets it the first week.
---
&gt; it looked like a cross between a kids mobile game and a wacky circus

Perfect explanation -- that's exactly how it feels.

Cross realm is worse, transmog is worse, multiple difficulties is worse

&gt;He is one of the lead devs of LHope and also worked on Ely before, I'd trust his word on this one.
---
Auto-Moderator deleted my first post, so here it is again.
---
&gt; the same people that would might aswell play TBC.
---
its all about the long game, sure they can release TBC and itll prolly do as well as classic, but after TBC would Wotlk do as well? I know cata certainly wont. I dont think people are looking for a trip down memory lane, they want an MMO that has the qualities that Classic had, and that TBC improved upon. Take out all the bad that came with TBC (very little tbh) and make expacs with the remaining core principles
---
also if blizzard can make entirely new franchises like overwatch and hots, they can certainly hire a team to make new expacs. its gonna make them money
---
That makes sense. I hadn't thought of it that way. Good point.
---
Yeah, the demand for MoP and WoD servers will be so overwhelming that I'm sure Blizzard will add them.
---
Took three seconds for somebody to incorrectly bring up layering. New record?
---
Transmog never bothered me.
---
I think the true issue with the bitter taste of gear visuals, is that they didn't matter at all in retail. Everyone was given the graphic for little effort. 
---
Now that we're going back to a time where if you have it you damn well earned it, those who are proud of their gear can proudly show it off. But (later) if transmog was added, I think we would be less ruffled because those proud people could show it off, or mog it to show another set they were proud of.
---
The skeeeel
---
Thanks I guess?
---
We decides to play D3 since it is a Blizz IP.
---
It's important to communicate that prior to the dungeon. That's all it is. Communicating what you need and what you want from the dungeon. If they say no, go find a different group or run your own. Will be super easy as a healer :)
---
ik it was added in cata, but you could fly in northrend, i am saying maybe only add flying to off azeroth worlds, but make them really big, or have a need and reason for flying
---
You'll be *fiiiine*...
---
The guy who wrote the section on body language is a creepy fucker and I think he would probably best be barred from interaction with other people in general.
---
Some people don't care for entering betas, others care a great deal. It's okay to be either one. Don't put one side down because you don't agree with it.
---
One of the things that's "great" with vanilla itemisation is how rpgesque it feels like. Why does my sword has a chance to shoot a fireball instead of augmenting the damage of my judgement? Idk maybe because the wizard that enchanted it thought that shooting fireballs was cool, probably didn't care for no pally spells
---
Haven't played in ages, what was the mage quest? Want to look it up. The only other class quest that I can rememeber being amazed by was the warlock fel fire one, that was amazing and had so many steps - I did never manage to kill the last boss though! How would you compare the hunter quest to that?
---
I knew that would come up one way or another.
---
The whole point is to show that you won't play it either way. It'll demonstrably change, and even if it didn't, its environment has changed so drastically, that even playing a 100% complete clone (even with 100% authentic patch progression) would *not* be like playing it then.
---
I feel like the term "better" is a bit confusing. I'm not talking about just improving it left and right. 
---
See, the thing is, patches make changes which I'm going to classify as follows: Changes which are supposed to be available to the playerbase at that point, and not earlier (like content), and if the devs had supernatural timebending powers they'd still make the change at the same time; and reactive fixes to errors that got recently discovered or finally became ready or feasible at the time. If the devs had supernatural timebending powers, they'd incorporate these into the game from the beginning of time (ignoring the strictly money-related side of extra cost of the change impacting a bigger range of content and having to be tuned accordingly).
---
In my opinion, the latter types of changes should be there in Classic, assuming they can be classified as fitting the spirit of the game at the time. (I feel like I need this constraint, because indeed if developers later thought removing ammo is a good idea, maybe they would have thought it'd have been loved by everyone from the beginning of time - but we know it'd be bad for classic. So we cannot ignore the change in mindset and in who they were trying to appeal to.)

So DW tanking is pretty much out the window at this point then?
---
It was awesome.  Chaos and panic while spamming drink button between waves.
---
Eh, the jump was annoying but not bad. I only missed it once and I'm crap at jumping.
---
Worst part about WC was how it splits right at the start. I had groups fail simply because a couple of players insisted that going right was the only way while the leader was going left. Or vice-versa. I don't care, where ever the tank goes that's where I go.
---
Imagine having pretended to play vanilla, and not knowing why people call it VC, but still being a dick about it
---
Feint, idk what this meme is though. I don't get it. It lowers threat on a target. Rogue skill.
---
Im fine with not being able to log in because thats the point, and the dcs so they fix those... But please dont roll me back when i next log in like where i was 10 minutes prior
---
&gt;However, do you think we're getting to the point where each expansion should just be a stand alone client?
---
No, that is just too much.  And with too many expansion servers, it will thin out the population too much.
---
PvP needs to be tested too though. And usually requires more testing due to the infinite amount of scenarios that could somehow lead to strange bugs. Like what if getting stunned while feared causes you to disconnect? Not saying this will happen, but this was actually a strange/unexpected bug on a popular unofficial realm, and people started to intentionally abuse it.
---
You're just pulling stuff out of nowhere. Oscar stated in the developing of classic wow panel at Blizzcon that the earliest backup they had in their archives was slightly before 1.12 patch prior to TBC.

My whole post was about the armor characters have. Especially for PvP. You could tell the highly skilled characters by that. Which I thought was cool. “Real” is termed as good. I don’t think any less of someone with different armor.
---
You appear to be misunderstanding what they mean when they talk about "layering".
---
There will absolutely be servers - in fact, we know this because they announced a cap of 10 classic characters per server, and 50 classic characters total across all classic servers.  This means there will be AT LEAST 5 classic servers at launch.
---
Also, layering is a temporary feature that is meant to allow the game to begin without a really shitty starting experience, and preventing dead servers after the tourists from retail leave.  It will not last past phase 1, because phase 2 includes world bosses and they don't want multiple layers with multiple copies of the same world boss.
---
At this time, I wouldn't hold your breath on individual expansions being in that dropdown.  TBC and WoTLK private servers have been pretty short lived, and couldn't maintain a sufficient population.  Until we prove there is the market for other expansions' servers, they simply won't make them.
---
Imagine how awesome its gonna be on release day... (if we dont get servers crash).. Man, cant wait for it

It's stupid, literally no reason to call it vc.
---
I'm mostly attracted to Holy Paladin due to the playstyle of buffing people not existing in retail WoW, and also so I can follow in the footsteps of the legendary LEEROY JENKINS. Not by leeroying of course, but by wearing a mishmash of random-ass gear designed to maximize my healing output. Since greater blessings will be in at launch, I can afford to be able to roll on gear that increases the amount my heals do as I won't have to spend all of the time budding.
---
So? You're in this game for the long haul.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if private servers change the math to fit with classic.
---
Hard to say tbh. For me BC was always the better version of vanilla. Maybe it was because in this expansion I finally started hardcore raiding and had the most success in it. But vanilla is gorgeous and classic will be great 2!
---
WHERE'S WALDO?!
---
Or I could argue you are autist for wasting your time on a dead topic instead of doing smth more useful.   
---
Anyways, if I was afraid of convo, i wouldn't even make this post in the first place.
---
That's the thing though.  It's not about right or wrong.  It's having the desire to actually test and go through the painful process of finding proof that is difficult to find due to evidence that doesn't exist or available.  
---
Right now, the beta feels like a publicity stunt.  Glitz and Glamour over substance.
---
I personally don't believe so. Many of the early early WoW people you may be thinking of are employees or moderators, as many are guaranteed a spot. That's what I'm aware of, anyway. I could very well be mistaken.

---
Random is random. You also gotta remember newer people still have valuable feedback to give. Even the people whom never played wow before.

At the time I rationalised it as "Outland is a magical asteroid with floating islands and debris everywhere, clearly gravity is not as pressing an issue here as it is on Azeroth."

Then of course they had to go and kill that by making it possible to fly in Northrend in the next expansion. Not only that, but you somehow learned how to fly in extra harsh conditions before you could fly in normal weather, which was super weird and nonsensical.
---
you misread my comment.  I was saying it would be in until phase 2.  "There can only be one azuregos or one kazzak ever," is a quote from Ion.  I believe in the vanion and the staysafetv wow media interviews, the kind of dancing around the sharding or layering definates, made me feel like they could keep layering until the world bosses are out.  They could even on high pop servers keep layering indefinitely if they have the ability to limit it by zones.  The by zone option of layering may be already in the servers if the team wants to consider limiting or expanding end game resources like rich thorium for arcanite and black lotus for flasks.
---
You clearly don't understand the word based on your reply. Im not saying it's right or wrong but thought I'd let you know that comment makes you look silly.
---
We actually abused layering to get that many people there. We had raid groups inviting people into our layer
---
Profesions/mount
---
Then gear
---
This screenshot shows Vem parrying the attack (look at the timestamps), which implies that he was attacking from the front, since attacks from behind cannot be parried. Backstab also cannot land from the front (from my recollection?)... something seems off, can you explain that to me?
---
WoW! finishing RFC at level 10 should have been REALLY hard on pservers. An average team of level 13 had trouble with it already... How was it for you guys? Were you all veterans? I heard dungeons are easier than what we were used from pservers, but I didn't think this much..
---
And i share his opinion. Now you might like it and disagree but i dont.
---
Gnome and Troll take the gold and silver IMO.  All others tied for last.
---
Or Warlock
---
That..is a really good comp. War + pala is one of the strongest pvp duos, then throw in mage for CC and burst and you have a crazy strong team. You all get the mage QoL benefits, and you have the core of any 5 man already.
---
Tailor/enchant is great to have around, mage crafted epic robe is solid, he can make bags for all of you, and you all can funnel him extra greens in return for enchants. 
---
Herb/alch is an okay pala profession, not the greatest since as the healers go they're probably the lease dependent on mana pots and buffs, but they certainly benefit. For maximal pvp she could just go engineering, having both of you as engineers would be strong, but herb/alch is still solid and helps you as a group farm cash.
---
The one interesting question is the goal of 3-manning dungeons, which sounds fun. I think if I were designing a group for that, I would go druid/warlock/paladin or druid/hunter/paladin. Druid brings thorns, motw, and does more damage than a tanking warrior which you'll need in a 3 man. Both warlocks and hunters bring an extra body to the group, and both have the ability to go longer than a mage thanks to LT or just mana-free damage. Also, warlock and hunter both have more generic if trickier options to CC multiple mobs, where mages can basically just sheep 1. Yes mages can kite for CC, but in doing so they have to stop dpsing, where as locks and hunters can dps while kiting.
---
That being said, you still have an incredibly strong 3-man group, and it's probably not worth losing the insane advantages of having your own personal portal and water fountain.
---
And anyone who has played wow for more than a couple months will know that's old ass gear and that person isn't anything special? No one thinks that person is good or anything?
---
Like I said it's not about right or wrong.  But at least some people are going through the painful process of trying to show video evidence.  It can be painful and hard to find.  
---
"Proof" from 15 years ago is going to be a near impossible task.  But some people need to do it.  Instead it's a publicity stunt and glitz and glamour over substance.
---
Etiquette, says, your entitled to roll need on the role you bring to the party, unless you specifically agree when you join, certain items are reserved, or that you will be rolling on your off role items.
---
This way the arguement happens before you  join, not after loot has dropped.
---
It isn't fair that The tank loses out on tanking upgrade to a non-tank, Nor is it fair that your healer loses out on healing gear to a non healer.  You roll on what you brought unless it's made clear at the very start. 
---
Otherwise, polite people get screwed for following the social norms, and greedy people get to hide behind social rules when it works in the favor, and violate the same rules to get what they want.
---
Why are you rushing to 60? Just enjoy the game as you go.
---
It's called VC because at launch you could use the backdoor to exit and reset the instance, and farm just the boat area over and over again, hence calling them VC runs, and it stuck.
---
I have a love hate with this dungeon but can't wait to go back 😃
---
You're right. I hadn't thought about that before.
---
But you won't be able to do that in Classic.
---
&gt; My main discovering ~~Wetlands~~ Low-Level Night Elf Slaughter House for the first time on Vanilla Wow
---
FTFY
---
I got a ring in 'ere last night
---
Nothing except the current heroic and mythic raid gear that is...
---
Taurens can’t kick for shit
---
Destiny got in to beta and had never played wow in his life. Loyalty means nothing to blizz. Also who gives a fuck
---
its definitely a tough thing to balance, they want to make new content, but you cant not raise the level cap, cuz then they would have any need to add much besides just more dungeons, raids, and pvp. plus the power creep would be huge, youd basically have lvl 60s as strong as lvl 70s were.
---
So needing to raise the level cap, it needs to require a good amount of effort so that people become invested. Idk if id care very much to do black temple if it wasnt for all the content that builds it up while leveling.
---
but now it takes longer to get to level cap, and they want to attract new players, this is why they would slightly increase the leveling speed expac, could they do it differently? Perhaps. Maybe add new zones on azeroth for leveling as well. it wasnt till Cata that they did this, but even then it was all end game level zones.
---
This would also attarct current players to maybe level again, gain a new experience if every 10 levels you can now do a different zone or something.
---
also.... NEVER ADD LEVEL BOOSTING
---
ahah nice stress test
---
Selfish, no. Stupid, yes.
---
Stupid because they want to go against the Classic design, assuming that private server meta will somehow still be relevant, not understand what a 14% parry ACTUALLY means.
---
Fury tanking will not exist in Classic, for raid bosses. It's a given. Bosses will simply obliterate Fury tanks. That, or tank healers going OOM in 30 seconds. Which is the same shit anyway.
---
Wrath is easily the best expansion they've released. Which is evident that it had the peak subscriber count.
---
20 man kara tuned for 60 that drops gear for the specs that need it would actually be pretty rad
---
Interesting. Never heard about the white room. Sounds to me like the place where Neo was trapped in by the Trainman! :-)
---
*snap*
---
Yep, this one is going in my cringe collection.
---
I would honestly just want the server left alone even if I move on to play other games. WoW classic, and even retail for that matter, don't need to be 15+ year games. It's okay for it to end, and to create a new game experience compare to getting to a point like BFA.
---
Hell, in 5 years from that point I'd still like to log in to my character and just reminisce about all my stuff. You know, where Org is still the same and not everyone flying around on rainbows.
---
And if they do a BC server, I hope it's a split off so that classic will be preserved. The next best idea is to do Seasonal Classic servers, altho they'd be a bit longer than typical seasons in games. After I burn out again on Classic or get to the point of no more progression, I'd still like to be able to come back in 5-10 years and make a new char and do it all again. 
---
I think I just want an official Classic experience available to me forever, sorta like how old games work. Let it just be the finished product that it was before BC and just leave it at that. Any other additions like expansions are still welcome but only as a new/split server. 
---
Long live Classic, forever!!!
---
Are invites to the Beta still going out? Does anybody know?
---
It wasn't the word he used, it's how he used it. "In a video game" would usually mean inside of the game unless said otherwise. I replied to what he said, not what he intended to say.
---
For horde it means a serious decrease to a tanks threat making overaggros more likely
---
I remember... The death... Over and over again D:
---
It should be that song in classic. They changed it in BC because it was too spooky (i can only guess?). In current-day WoW it is still in game at the bone pile in RFD. It truly is one of the more immersing and unique songs though!
---
tested it, it works
---
https://redd.it/buttaf
---
i agree, flying is super immersion breaking on azeroth
---
Yea, but most people who did that called it DM vc spam/DM last boss spam as I recall.
---
Omg yes.  I remember that being the first time I really felt like there was an epic battle going on in the game.  I remember freaking out with all the other guys in the dungeon since it was our first time actually running the place.  I played a hunter at the time and I remember running for my life every time I tried to place a trap to slow them down haha.
---
Good luck getting to 60 in eight days 👍
---
It's not about right or wrong.  It's about going through the painful effort of finding potential evidence that has ridiculously hard to find.  They at least have the expertise and determination to do all that.
---
With the beta, what do we really have?  What is getting the most attention?  It's a publicity stunt.
---
Its also the icon of the disengage skill of hunters.
---
Improved imp for more health and dmg!
---
Male nightelves are...special. They can't shoot bows either.
---
That’s not an ability it’s a debuff. 
---
Clutter- a curse
---
That random arranges your inventory and bank space every 30 seconds. Permanent until removed. 
---
Find a Druid or Mage.
---
All depends on the situation and how you execute it.  Druid has shit chest and you have a decent high level green?  You're an asshole if you take it.  It's an equal upgrade to both of you and you need it without discussing first?  You're an asshole.  
---
As long as it's a reasonable upgrade for you (and more so if it's not so much for them) and you discuss it beforehand, then I'd expect most people to be ok with you taking it. 
---
At least have the decency to inspect the druid and gauge their level of desire for any items that may be coming up and then discuss it with them.
---
They aren't. They have enough players as of right now and aren't sending any more emails.
---
People think they’re missing something by not getting there first.
---
Not really. They produce shitty content
---
The mystery was a big part of what made sunwell awesome too. You just didn't see the content unless you were in a really good guild.
---
As a Mage, it was like a dream had come true
---
Please blizzard make this happen.
---
Imagine believing this. Most classes will look like clowns in their BiS gear, fyi. Especially for the first year or so.
---
My wife had some nice words of wisdom trying (and failing) to log on during last night's stress test.
---
"I'd rather burn myself out on live than during the beta/stress test"
---
Maybe it's for the best?
---
There was a vanilla pvp video with reach for the sky by social D but I cannot think of the dudes name or what class it was. I just remember watching it all the time. If anyone finds it I will greatly appreciate you for at least 15 minutes

This user is likely a scammer trying to get people to purchase stolen designs from their fake store. Reddit has a problem currently with scammers posting random t-shirt/coffee mug/poster designs, followed by a post from someone asking where to get it. Someone (usually the OP but not always) then links to some random t-shirt site, occasionally one that has a "limited time purchase" in attempt to get people to buy from their fake store. These sites have potential of either sending you a fake/low quality product, or stealing your credit card information.

I highly encourage people to report these posts as spam to help people avoid getting their information stolen or receive a crappy product. Be aware also that these people are posting to multiple franchise or fan based subs, so you may see some of these posts in subs you subscribe to.

This bug I think happened to me once long ago so we just ended up skipping the chieftain and going to fight Gahz’rilla. Still got my carrot on a stick so I was happy as could be to get my first trinket.
---
Hope they don't fix this.
---
Mage Tower appearances were a good example of this.  You had to overcome a challenge that also is now gone so you can't just come back 10 levels higher and stomp it for the appearance.
---
CNt wait for this dungeon omg great post
---
60 in 4 days.....LOL
---
Try playing while super stoned. You go right into the world like it's an extension of reality. I'm taking a week off with a couple ounces for launch.
---
it's just not true. a lot of hard work went into bfa and it is not shitty in the slightest.
---
The correct technique for kicking down a door or heavy object.
---
Wasn't Legion well loved? I hardly played it myself because of Nost but from what I heard it seemed successful.
---
A lot of the dungeon and raid content of TBC was good and they made some previously neglected specs more viable, but the overall game design and game play started going downhill. The world wasn't as immersive and alive, they introduced things like daily quests. Attempts to balance PvP for eSport purposes. The game was becoming a vehicle for raiding instead of raiding as something that takes place in the world that you enter.
---
Omg.....I forgot all about this....
---
Myself personally, I will probably rush my first character because of FOMO and then make an alt to take it easy with leveling later.
---
This is blatantly false - many classes in their different BIS gear-sets (throughout the content releases) look like absolute trash.
---
Once I found RPPVP servers, I never rolled anywhere else.
---
That being said, because of the PVP tag, it drags in more PvPers than RPers. And this is alright. You are not forced to be in character.
---
There will be plenty of people who don't RP at all that hang out on the RPPVP server, and for the most part, they are respectful about it.
---
You will always have those people who try to 'ruin immersion' while you are trying to RolePlay, even on plain RP servers. I can tell you right now, with Classic and no crossrealm or dungeon finder, if someone does this, their reputation is about to plummet.
---
You see that even you yourself can't tell how it "should" be. There is no perfect game. If we start to think how it would be "better", first, there is as many opinions as people and second there would be no end to it.
---
Vanilla is done. It was, flawed or not. That is what should be available to play. The game. I don't care about the "experience" or anything surrounding it. I can make my own. I've already created a full raiding guild. ;)
---
Even though in practice aiming for an exact replication is impossible, at least it is a clear cut goal. Fortunately Blizzard seem to share my sentiments and that's enough for me, even if we don't get a 100% copy. I just fear a little all the "change this, change that" voices. I hope Blizzard will never listen to them.
---
Okay negative Nancy I was asking a simple question why rush when you’re missing the entire game by rushing to max. To do what, rep farm grind professions? I’m not trying to dictate how people play I really want to know why rush.
---
Oh they're not. As far as I remember all the epic 2 sets were + Stam and the blues had something useful.
---
What are you talking about? Now we play the game.
---
Kenny equip Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar.
---
Human female/troll male/night elf female looks the best.
---
No they aren't equal points. Only one side is saying that they want to police what *everyone else* looks like.
---
Ah, that's where you misunderstood me. I don't feel entitled to a position specifically into this beta or any other. It isn't the beta itself I'm upset with, it's the lack of a seniority system.
---
You can get over the wall through some clever wall jumping. it's not easy tho, especially since the whole party needs to do it
---
Don't remember the first time specifically, but vaguely remember any of the 5+ times I ran this dungeon. Was some really cool loot in there for a warrior, even managed to get lucky enough to get that epic (in hindsight pretty shitty) sword. 
---
Together with Scarlet Monastery and Blackrock Depths probably the most memorable levelling dungeon in vanilla for me.
---
"Rapidly decreasing" != They aren't.  
---
They are, just not nearly as many or as often as there were before. To say they aren't at all is a misrepresentation of what Blizzard said in their post (Ref: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-access-as-of-may-22/179883](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-access-as-of-may-22/179883))
---
Someone datamined the beta build and found armor values for various raid bosses; it was at least a thousand less than pserver values.
---
And no, fury is not "threat capped", at least not for Alliance.
---
I heard this last night and thought it was great. 
---
Thanks for posting it.
---
so for example on live wow, there are people that group up do one quest and leave the group.  this is ok in a single instance, but when 60 people are joining into a group listed in the group finder and then leaving and going about their regular questing, it can inflate the number of people on a server instance by a large amount.  Think about if people are joining up for a raid, or for mage food and players in server layer 2 and 3 keep joining into layer 1.  Soon layers 2 and 3 are empty and layer 1 has almost everyone.  One way to hedge against this, is if people are spread out among layers 1 2 and 3, is if players start grouping up, create a "pre made group" layer 4 for newly created parties to start filling up.  
---
I have no idea if this is what is being shown or is happening behind the scenes.  I am just like you imagining a likely decision that let to grouping up moving players to a new instance or a very low population instance.
---
I would take it from a rogue, but not a druid.
---
Not very hard
---
Same. I played on some good blizzlike privaterealms that were solid but it was still the ever-looming feeling of "this can be deleted at any time and it isnt really mine or legit". LOVED the gameplay but didnt feel rewarding in terms of effort due to that.
---
SO now I got the real deal coming :) 
---
Also yea... so many people from private servers etc talk about "you GOTTA pick the best race and have BiS or do this in that amount of time" elitist e-penis bs but Im gonna do just like you. Chill, enjoy, explore, engage.
---
Week one Ragnaros kill. That's the plan.
---
I also wouldn’t want it in classic, as it doesn’t belong there at all, although if blizzard for whatever reason added it, it wouldn’t be a make or break reason to not play for me.
---
you guys complain about the most inane shit
---
My first run, we ran down the stairs unaware... pain
---
It probably wasn’t even transmogged gear. If you have gold, you can buy “heirloom” gear that uses the same models as vanilla t0. Every piece you equip increases your experience gain by 10%, up to a max of 55% experience gain
---
What kind of blasphemy is this
---
Retail has suffered the "death by a thousand cuts" idea. I'm for graphical upgrades but nothing else
---
And slippery slope is a logical fallacy, not an argument.
---
That's true and a good way to look at it.
---
Rofl agreed what the actual fuck am I reading.
---
&gt;Are you a slippery lil fella that he gets to chase around?
---
This exactly. Layering had me troubled until I realized what they were using them for and I agree with their logic. It's already going to be a complete cluster for the first couple of weeks until people start to finally go back to retail or quit and you start getting into the 30's and 40's level range where it naturally thins out a bit.
---
I remember most of the times I went to this event.
---
Make troll going full Bruce Lee
---
SHAAAROOOOONNN
---
my one still says stress test and beta, im guessing im not in?
---
Some of us played a lot in vanilla and TBC and have seen the story enough for an entire population through leveling alts. I don't want to soak in the low level content again. I want to play the lv60 content again.
---
I want to start raiding and pvp'ing. I want to abuse a young economy to get my lv60 mount while it is still young and able to be taken advantage of. I want to run around killing people who just hit 40 and bring their joy to a crushing halt.
---
This is what brings me joy in my game. Play your game, let other people play their's.
---
I looted Feet of the Lynx in Wetlands and equipped them, not knowing how valuable they were. I was bummed when I found out they were going for 100g+. They were such a small upgrade too.
---
Best one? Dead mines for sure, first dungeon, first real grouping, amazing atmosphere, change of scenery, nice loot for everybody.
---
Worst one? As someone said before gnomeregan it's such a maze, idk i simply don't like it
---
Totally off topic, but it makes me so happy that all the people say DM and not VC
---
Have a nice day :)
---
The Mage Tower was a group of about 7 instanced solo dungeons. Every spec within a class had a different dungeon, but many were shared across classes (similar to artifact quests). For instance, every tank spec had the same dungeon, and most of the healers (except disc) had a dungeon. These solo challenges were basically one or two bosses that involved a lot of situational awareness, akin to a mythic boss. They were tuned for mid-expansion stat values so they were made a bit easier by later ilvls, but they were still pretty tough even with +30 ilvls. Some of them were basically impossible at their intended ilvl of ~915.
---
The challenges were pretty damn tricky overall, and for the most part you couldn't brute force them, though some were fairly easy (vengeance DH, for example, made the tank one pretty trivial because you could double jump to negate a devastating knockback mechanic).
---
Razorfen Downs I believe
---
Everytime I read about this discussion with clown gear from vanilla and transmog and all that, I always think off the scene in pirates of the caribbean when they gather the nine pieces of eight and its all junk items!
---
Yeah I wouldn't throw a tantrum if blizzard added it, I would be dissapointed but it wouldn't ruin the fun for me.
---
The first half of your comment is a question.  The second half isnt
---
Also OP stated he is gonna play an alt casually. So it really doesnt matter that he rushed his first char.
---
One of them is probably a paladin who won't do much damage anyway/is healing.
---
Ah, my apologies. I thought I read otherwise elsewhere.
---
I've played to 50 on Nost and in all that time I've never seen anyone whispering me "hey stranger, want to team up agains a common foe?". usually people just send off invites, when they see we need to kill same mob.
---
I can hear the music already.  Dun..dun..dun  dun    dun    LETS ROCK!
---
I played exclusively in Wrath, (didn't play the entire time) and never used LFG. As I recall LFG was implemented a pretty good way into Wrath. I'm very excited for Classic, but the class balance compared to Wrath seems pretty bad. From what i've heard and read, 50%+ of the specs are completely terrible in Classic. That is kind of depressing for someone that played the game when damn near everything was at least playable.
---
The naxx revamp was widely loved. Only top 0.1% of players actually downed KT in vanilla with most not even entering the raid. TOC was just bad filler content though, sure. ICC more than made up for what TOC lacked. 
---
TBC had very high quality raids. Kara was one of my favorite raids of all time and BT/Sunwell both were incredible. SSC/TK were okay. You also had the addition of very difficult 5-man heroics. 
---
I enjoyed firelands and that was the last raid I competitively pushed before quitting shortly into MoP, but I wouldn’t consider it up to par with TBC raids or ICC.
---
Don’t worry these are the people who will burn out by January.
---
There's an add-on called advance interface options I believe that has most of these options in it since blizzard took them out
---
I love how this quote is repeated so often, because it shows just how out of touch Blizzard had become from the fans.
---
Not to take anything away from ZF (because it's amazing), but I don't even know if it cracks my top 5 in Vanilla alone.  Deadmines, Gnomer, and Sunken Temple take the top 3 spots.
---
Basically it involves this quest:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2768](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2768)
---
You are telling to Bly that he's a thief and should give you the Divino-Matic Rod.
---
He disagree and they attack you
---
The fun about WoW is min-maxing, playing as efficiently as possible.
---
Games don't have a solid track record of being WoW killers. Looking over at /r/Wildstar once every few months is hilarious.
---
But having a much higher parry chance in combination with lower armor could lead to furys being threat-capped, don't you agree?
---
Shit is that still happening? People were getting constant DCs from Kalimdor all last night as well. Can't believe it's still going on.
---
I love the random nightelves that just tower over everyone else
---
Warrior discord looked in to this. The addon calculates 3% hit scope as melee hit eventhough it didn't give melee hit anymore at that patch.
---
I never said anything about difficulty, but which also isn't the only metric you judge a game by. Cata did so much wrong that I'm not even going to get into why it's awful with you.
---
What are you talking about? There are a BUNCH of awesome games out there. BFA being dogshit doesn't mean you can't look elsewhere.
---
Troll male has pretty good form I must say
---
This sounds like me and I will be going heavy frost with all talents going into single target damage. I like the crits and efficiency that the frost tree offers.
---
Everyone are using the waterstrider :p
---
I remember being so intimidated.. a huge mob of trolls spawned and for a moment I thought it was over. Fast forward to retail leveling as a tank and easily being able to pull the entire pack.
---
All forced movement spells like disengage and wild charge have this issue, it's been in the game for over 10 years.
---
the system was working exactly the way was coded.  it was not an error according to the code.    
---
FYI computers don't just have ideas pop into their processors and decide to do something else that a human didn't program into them.

---
Wrath was amazing! The music, the story! But near the end when the Dungeon Finder was implemented, you could slowly see the world grow empty.
---
Then... The expansion that shall not be named was released.
---
For maximum gold, you should each take Mining, Skinning, and Herbalism, one each. Then all of you take Enchanting and DE quest rewards you don't need. Vendor most weapons. Do what you want at 60.
---
You will still get a little green light around you and a sound cue when you level up a reputation. I will miss the big yellow popup when you finally down a boss you've been wiping on for weeks. In Classic you will just hear the noise of 40 nerds screaming in discord. Which is nice.
---
So a pet named Vol'Jin huh
---
First I'm going to farm my tank set. Then my damage set, and finally my healing set. While I work on farming enough dungeons to stack 3 different gear sets to pre-raid BiS, I will be leveling enchanting to 265, unlearning it, leveling gnomish engineering, unlearning it, and leveling up goblin engineering to 300. I havent decided yet what my other prof will be, but it will likely be a gathering one.
---
Meanwhile any time I'm bored of my main I will be working on leveling a hunter alt for farming mara (and later DM trib).
---
I don't think battlegrounds are out on Phase 1 so I can't start my reputation grinds or begin to rank in PvP, which is fine because I won't be able to commit that much time to it for like a year anyways. But I will probably also be farming LBRS for a key.
---
I'm gunna have a busy winter.
---
It's like a sprint for me. I like things fast, push myself and so forth. I know the game already, meaning I will never have that nostalgia feel ever again unless I can de-neuralize myself.
---
I kinda see retail wow continuing to shift towards a mobile game like monetization model focused solely on extracting as much money from as few people as possible, while wow classic gets some life breathed into it.
---
I also sincerely hope blizz will take advantage of everyone being distracted from retail to take the time necessary to figure out how to fix all the ways they fucked this expansion up
---
Or maybe people can only reasonably take off a week or 2 and want to get as much done before they return to normal schedule.
---
Also lets assume hes playing 16 hours a day. And reaches 60 on day 8. Is that really rushing?  What is rushing?
---

---
I thought tooltip didn't go up in vanilla, but the actual value did?  Sounds like they just fixed the tooltip.
---
I was never a raider, just a casual. So when BC came out and I finally hit max I came back here and grinded out my first purple weapon. Man was that an awesome feeling.
---
Sounds fun.  My daughter is only 6 months old so I have a ways to go before 'family gaming'
---
Regarding professions-
---
Someone will have to have mining at level 60, mithril/thorium are very valuable and you don't really want to be going to the AH all the time.  I would say drop enchanting as it's the least likely to make good $$ and just do tailoring/mining from the start.  You can either go skinning + engi or skinning + bs to get a head start on leveling that prof, but I'd be cautious against investing too much in proffs at first and instead make sure you guys all get your mounts at 40 and perhaps a weapon upgrade or two for the warrior/paladin at crucial times.  Mages don't need any gear upgrades as they level but warriors and pal are both very dependent on having a decent weap, and sometimes the AH can solve that problem at a very reasonable price. 
---
You'll definitely be able to 3-man an instance but it will take awhile.  A fun family challenge at least, but you might as well pick up an extra DPS or two to help it along. 
---
If you do want to do enchanting I'd definitely recommend just disenchanting all spare gear until he maxes out the skill from disenchanting (I think around 60-70 skill points) as this will save you a lot of those early mats (hundreds of strange dust/magic essence) and time.  You won't make any $$ on ench until you get close to 300 skill and it's a LOT of unsold greens/blues that you're sacrificing.  You can make some $$ back from selling the ench mats but this isn't super profitable especially early on in a servers life.  Later on you can make good money with the last 2 tiers of mats (dream dust, nether essence, illusion dust, eternal essence). 
---
I'm not saying you're doing this at all, but also be sure to let people play the game as they wish and not impose yourself on them.  There are optimal ways to play, but if your wife wants to spec holy then feel free to explain why it might not be 'best' but in the long run people will enjoy it more when there isn't someone else telling them how to play.
---
Nice guide, thank you
---
I vividly remember my first Gnomer run.  I had done lv 29 BGs on my main character for over half a year before finding out some friends at my school had recently started playing WoW and had all just gotten to around lv 30.  I decided to quit pvp and start grouping with them in pve.
---
We did Gnomer immediately together and it was an absolute shit show.  None of us had ever done it and no one knew about atlas or anything like that.  We wandered around aimlessly trying to figure out what to do and where to go.  I remember dinging 30 at some point and having a deep feeling of regret that I had just given up my pvp fun for that shit show of a group.  None of them knew how to play their classes at all and a couple of them just derped around the whole time; we died so many times. 4 dps with a paladin tank/healer combo (did not work).
---
It was so bad that I did not group with them ever again in vanilla.  They tried to get me to join for other dungeons/leveling, even to their guild and I refused.  I was still friends with them at school, but it wasn't until TBC that I started playing with them in WoW again.
---
it is likely a combination of that and anti cheat software that kicks players from the servers for travelling too fast.
---
S Tier: Troll M, Gnome M, Gnome F
---
A Tier: Human M, Night Elf F
---
B Tier: Troll F, Human F
---
C Tier: Forsaken F, Forsaken M,Dwarf F
---
D Tier: Orc F, Dwarf M
---
E Tier: Orc M
---
F Tier: Night Elf M
---
...
---
SS Tier: Tauren M, Tauren F
---
Tauren Rogues kick so hard that they stun the server, allowing them to maintain stealth.
---
unless you're in SFK and dont want to hear the short courtyard loop 50 times
---
And in classic like 80% of the classes never stop looking like a hobo or wearing the same bright teal dress.
---
You need to login to find out.  Whether you're in the Beta *and* Stress Test, or just the Stress Test - we all see "Stress Test &amp; Beta" in the dropdown on the launcher.
---
You'll need to login to find out if you're in both.  If you see the Beta servers and can join them, then congrats - you're in the Beta.  They're called Beta (PvE) and Beta (PvP).
---
Was playing league of legends yesterday.... my wife asked me at the end of a loss where I obviously looked ultra frustrated: ‘what’s wrong hun?’
---
‘Classic hasn’t released yet. ‘
---
&gt;Also OP stated he is gonna play an alt casually. So it really doesnt matter that he rushed his first char.
---
Thank you for listening. I rarely have time for games, never play them hence the 2 weeks of work, going hardcore then just go super casual on my OG main Paladin. Unless, I get bored because of rushing to 60.
---
pvp was awful and broken.
---
I don't think they can add more harder raid content with better gear. You are already so ridiculously overpowered at Naxx gear, it just wouldn't work. I can see them doing events and maybe bring in new dungeons etc. But for those who have cleared Naxx within a few months there will be nothing new. And that's a fair amount of people, Naxx is a cakewalk compared to mythic raids today. 
---
I can also see them releasing TBC ofc, which I hope for because my only experience of that expansion is from the old and really shitty private servers. 
---
Another option is to release new servers that have new content on them or revised old content.
---
My reasoning is that its predetermined. A bit like buying gold. By  being a streamer he gets outside of the game help that wouldnt be available within the average ranges of the game.
---
the most hardcore of players will get roflstomped by the minions of the streamers. Players on streamer realms will be on the whim of their streamer overlords.
---
Un'goro mafia are a fly's shit to the influence a streamer will have on a server.
---
Have 15% of a server leave when the streamer leaves? Bam 35% - 65% server population overnight making more people leave because of bad population balance.
---
tl;dr: streamers will get stuffed in every part of the game whether its hundreds of FAPs for PvP, AQ questline, R14, world bosses etc. and not even the most hardcore non-streamers will have a say in it.
---
Upon relogging after one of the many disconnects yesterday evening, my character model was about half scale. I was playing a female orc warlock, and the model was almost the same size as the summoned imp. I was in a group at the time and asked them what they saw. Model appeared correct on their end.
---
gnomeregan?  you must be the only person in the world who likes it haha
---
deadmines has to be up there for the cool storyline and being most alliance players' first dungeon experience though!  
---
SFK, SM, LBRS/UBRS, strat and scholo &lt;3
---
Hilarious. Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
You're extremely pessimistic if you think they're just going to go back on what they've already been recorded saying. Layering ends before phase 2.
---
&gt;  Unless, I get bored because of rushing to 60.
---
i dont think this will happen
---
1 boomkin with the mages pls
---
If he plays 16 hours a day and follows a lvling guide, he can make it
---
that's subjective:
---
* Yes the journey IS the game, but I have done the journey.
---
* Will level an alt for THAT journey.
---
* A whole new meta among the first 60s
---
Fire mages especially
---
Well my plan is to name my pet Cuckpolice. That cat will gank horde as a judge, jury and exicutioneer.
---
You're talking about RFD.  I like the conclusion of it though, that long spiraling run up the mountain.  
---
The run from theramore is a bit much but you're then more than halfway to the next flightpath in SE Feralas and Gadget- so you can at least get those out of the way.  Plus you're running through the Barrens for awhile so if you see any flagged Horde you can tickle their funnybones
---
Gnomer? I feel like you'd be in a minority with that one haha
---
My top 3 would be sfk, sm (counting arms and Cath as one because they tiny), and rfd
---
yike
---
So ure telling me to trust blizzard, who cant make a decent expac to save their lives, to create content exceding classic? If u truly want the long game for blizzard, having multiple expacs running at the same time is the ultimate move for them, added content would eliminate this option leaving players at a do or die state. Also 1.13 content would pretty much just cater to the hardcore audienxe not giving the casual audience any benefit from it. And last nut not least, tuning around all of these power layers will blow out of proportion. It was already awful when naxx hit.
---
9 out of 10 people love tbc and there is no reason to think blizzard should play with fire in this decision.
---
I did forget about it, thanks for reminding me! I don't even know if I had it back then, but knowing myself, I sure did
---
I hope these test make launch evening smooth as butter because they sound like horror stories.
---
that was a Q&amp;A followup explanation from 1 guy, imo people are exaggerating it a bit... the fact that blizz took so long for legacy servers and just DMC'd every bigger pserver out there is a powerful statement though.
---
I disagree
---
&gt; For that reason it is impossible for any expansion to ever be better or on par with vanilla wow
---
You are assuming that everyone has your priorities. You can easily make a case for BC being better due to objectively better class and raid design. There is no obective reason to not say "well, the old end game is obsolete. so what?"
---
You're correct, TUF required exalted with AV faction and you had to be level 60 to equip it.
---
Yup, and then spend the next 20 minutes running in a big circle around the instance wondering if we missed a  boss.
---
FPS wasn't too bad. The lag was real though
---
not saying its not gonna happen, I was just stating that they wouldnt get WF without a shaman in their group
---
No, I demand nubile young gryphons!
---
Still have my screenshots from it!
---
You could extend that to the treatment of expansions as well, by switching the separate gear upgrade chains for expansion based debuffs applied to old gear.
---
Imagine if T1, BC T1, and WotLK T1 were all about equal in power level, but when in Outland fel energies reduce all old world gear by 90%,  When in Northrend the focused will of the LK does the same to all old world and Outlands gear. And so on for each tier. Do the same thing with your level, but as you gain experience the effect of the debuff on your level weakens regaining your levels. 
---
That means PvP doesn't get put on the same gear treadmill reset each expansion. And it also means that after two expansions, going back to MC or BWL or AQ would be just as challenging as you remember.
---
Orc Male with the sparta kick wins it
---
I cant recall the name but it was before I went horde, on my ally mage and one thing has stuck in my head about it. We had no idea what was about to happen and got #&amp;@!ED SO HARD..
---
?
---
Yes, it will later on. the game will progress from MC to BWL to AQ and eventually to Naxxramas in case you didnt know.
---
Apart from that you can exchange gong quest with first 60, R14 grind etc. etc.
---
I got so used to them, I miss them now :(
---
Guess he wants to break the world record, which is 4 days 20 hours /played (116 hours). 
---
I think a lot of retail players will be extremely disappointed when they realize leveling while not hard is definitely time consuming.
---
Funny, whatever expansion people talk about they always say PvP was broken or somehow made worse. I wouldn't know though, never really PvPd until Nost, vanilla PvP is definitely broken though. Still fun!
---
People do it with every game. Everyone wants to be among the first to get to the end.
---
I dont understand... at that level you should only have miss and resist.. and healer mana should end in 3-4 heals..
---
Awful.
---
Imagine what the launch will look like.
---
https://youtu.be/bIVTT4fgPQI
---
i find the elitists kinda weird because it seeems like a huge number of people but in reality the elite guilds and pvpers are only a small minority of the population
---
Im excited to try maraudon and dire maul as their meant to be played
---
What is this past tense you’re using. Blizzard is still terribly out of touch with their fans. Its only the classic team that is doing well these days because it’s full of people who love classic wow.
---
In TBC, my friend and I would trick people into doing Gnomer by going into LFG claiming it was an RFK run.
---
This composition is great. However I do have a slight alternative.
---
I'm playing a paladin with 2 friends and we decided the best group would be a warrior and a warlock. We are going to level together as long as possible. 
---
First up, the warrior would be the tank, and he gets free threat from retribution aura and imp fire shield. Also blood pact is nice too. 
---
Secondly, warlocks get powered up by heals due to life tap and having access to that conversion of resources. Paladins are also incredibly efficient healers which makes this even better. 
---
I personally think warlock is a better choice than mage with this set up. They also get added utility of soul stone, healthstones, and summoning portals. With 3 you already have the correct number to summon any guild members for dungeons. Missing out on portals, arcane intellect and conjured food/drink isn't a big deal if you just buy some water or get some from a passing mage.
---
This same thing happened when OSRS released. Rather than coexisting happily the OSRS fanbase went out of their way to absolutely shit on everything RS3. 
---
Now that is happening here; rather than allowing Classic to stand on its own merits people find the need to belittle the other version of the game for no gain whatsoever.
---
If Classic is going to be what we all hope it to be in an enlightenment for Blizzard showing how popular the older style of MMOs can be in 2019 it shouldn't require people to shit on a game many of them have never actually played.
---
RemindMe! 89 days
---
Hey Joe, is that you?
---
Aah your priest is grass and I've got the weed whacker!
---
I like how vanilla dealt with this. Instead of getting a bonus everyday to make you feel you have to log in. They went the other way around and gave you a bonus for being logged out(atleast if you did it in an inn) so you could still be allowed not to play the game all the time and dont feel like you got too far behind from all your friends
---
i feel you bro.
---
Anyone who ran Gnomer with me and my friend actually liked it.  We know that place pretty darn well.
---
The thought of keeping a gross old t-shirt for 14 years is bumming me out.
---
3 sword and boards. Authentic.
---
Whenever I'd get a group going for this, I'd grab a Paladin and Priest, Warrior for tanking and two Mages.
---
Pull it all. Both Mages would start Blizzarding right away, the Paladin and Priest would keep Warrior at full HP. It was a-m-a-z-i-n-g
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
Legendary RNG. Killed my first guild within two months.
---
Yes. 65,340,285, which should take us 7 weeks, 5 days, 13 hours and 20 minutes, giving ourselves 3 hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can jus... you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around. Or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters...
---
Gnomeregan is definitely my least favorite dungeon in vanilla, and possibly even all of wow
---
The only people who like Gnomer are me, my best friend, and anyone who has ran Gnomer with us.
---
I don't think that anyone is under any delusions as to how quickly content will be cleared by good guilds ready to roll on release.
---
The rest of the population will still struggle for much of the same reasons you just mentioned. Mainly, getting 40 people together.
---
Just play on a srivate perver
---
you'll learn patience long before you reach ZF haha - SM armoury and cathedral will not allow reckless pulls!
---
That's true, a leveling guide basically negates being new to the process. Personally I've always hated them, I find them anathema to the experience. But that's just me.
---
Who cares, it was fun back then, it'll be fun now.
---
ah shit, im not in the beta, only the stress test
---
I think a lot of people say "oh i can easily do it in 5-6 days" without having leveled in vanilla in 15 years.
---
Most of them will end up at \~10 days played for lvl 60 tbh
---
True, I was thinking that the Mage got the poly off before the Hunter hit Bestial Wrath. I can't remember if you can Bestial Wrath when the pet is CC'd to break the CC
---
&gt; Without the surprise, rogues are crap 
---
Yea.. right.. good luck with that...
---
How do you have 0 XP after killing it?
---
Just out of curiosity - can you see the Beta servers at all?  I.e., are they there but offline to you?  Or can you not see them?
---
We've figured out World of Warcraft. With the exception of two items, almost everything is irrelevant once you raid. It'll just take longer to get there.
---
Think about it... every expansion, when released, is always "the best". They really nailed it. Then raiding starts and there is no point in doing anything else.
---
Nice "no true Scotsman" malarkey.
---
Well the thing is, i believe that at such an event whoever is speaking is representing Blizzard as a company, kinda like how many social media people have "my opinions are solely my own" in their bio so that people can't quote them against their employers.
---
Yeah I don't think RFC was doable at all before level 12 judging by pserver difficulty. Tank would lose 25% of his HP with each hit, healer's mana wouldn't last much and damage dealers should miss a lot, meaning the fights would be prolonged.... I fin it very strange they managed to finish at level 10.
---
Uh... Okay? Thanks captain obvious.
---
Thanks; this is useful for NEs who want to level in Eastern Kingdoms. Everyone else will already have the IF/Menethil FP as soon as they get to Menethil.
---
In City of Heroes  content was pretty much universally scaled. There was a little open world content that wasnt but anything and everything to do with quests was.  
---
The thing was though you could modify the difficulty of the quest. You could make mobs Your Level (X). They could be X -1 all the way to X +4. On top of that you could dictate how many players the game should think is in your group. Which dictates the number of enemies, enemy types, and general mechanics. This could be just you (An average encounter might have 3 mobs) all the way to 8 total (An average encounter might have 12-18 mobs. Plus two bosses. Plus a handful of leiutenants.)  
---
I absolutely adore it. You want to roflstomp some bad dudes? You have the option. You want to make everything as hard as trying to beat some old NES games with only 1hp? You can do it. The harder you make it the more exp you got. The faster you leveled. The better loot that dropped and more numerously.
---
Only if the tank is awful, sure.
---
Go back in time and play launch week on tichondrius prime time.
---
Nah, he's not ill.
---
Just a little bit radiated.
---
Even having leveled to 60 three times during Vanilla myself, I struggle to see how likely this is.
---
I'd love to accomplish the same, it just seems so unlikely.
---
cant see any beta servers
---
I'm assuming a whole other layer of gnomes below them.
---
I mean... im in. My old guild is partially in. /1 on the first days were all very early.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say bro.
---
It's dirt easy if your ping is acceptable and your computer doesn't lag out in the midst of it.
---
\&gt; My reasoning is that its predetermined. A bit like buying gold. By being a streamer he gets outside of the game help that wouldnt be available within the average ranges of the game.
---
So what?
---
\&gt; the most hardcore of players will get roflstomped by the minions of the streamers. Players on streamer realms will be on the whim of their streamer overlords.
---
And non-harcore players will get roflstomped by hardcore players. Not everyone is going to be equally "strong".
---
\&gt; Have 15% of a server leave when the streamer leaves? Bam 35% - 65% server population overnight making more people leave because of bad population balance.
---
So you don't want the people there but you don't want them to leave either?
---
TLDR; Git Gud
---
I played on Outland EU during tbc, which was part of Battlegroup 8 called “Misery” and the community was great within arena players
---
We had full active forums and The IRC channel was fkn awesome
---
Since it was only in BGs and arena and like 7-8 servers (iirc) it was a nice limit and suddenly the best players of different realms could face 
---
That was pretty cool but then it got out of hand
---
I bought cata and made it to 83 and then quit. Returned a week ago to check new content - with classic hype and all - and man does it feel strange
---
It’s like you’re running around in the nether tirelessly following dots in the map.
---
No sense of actually being somewhere in a world, it’s more like you’re floating in an ever changing nether, split between dimensions lol. They started to use a lot of phasing in wotlk quest lines and I really liked it.. but it got out of hand.. If I find a rare mob (which aren’t really rare at all anymore) I just run past it, it barely feels like it’s there, like I found something
---
It was probably just spawned as I came running, and might be gone if I turn my shoulder, into a different dimension
---
It’s the frkn feel of the original idea of a “World” of Warcraft that’s gone
---
Gone!!
---
Agree with the point that the world was more involved.  What BC improved and was sorely needed was the ability for the hybrid classes to be.... well hybrids.
---
A Bear druid was the perennial physical eater.  Amazing physical tank, not so much in other areas.
---
Prot Paladins were the best AoE tanks in the game and damn near mandatory for Hyjal.  Loved that this was possible.
---
I could go on, but that's just a couple examples.  The class design is where BC thrived where Vanilla didn't.  Outland was great and all but you're right in saying that it was the only area for that rewarded relevant gear and whatnot.
---
That all being said, I'd take BC over Vanilla.  Love them both, and both have their perks, but I felt like professions were at their peak in BC with specialized professions and highly rewarding gear from just about all of them.  Class Design as I mentioned before.  The presented content was pretty good all around, producing some of the most beloved end game we've had in WoW's history, not just in raiding.
---
Oh, someone mentioned world pvp.  I had a blast in Nagrand fighting for Halaa.  People wanted Talbuks and the rep items, so it was pretty active, at least on my server.
---
Anywho, that's all just... like... my opinion man... I'm stoked for WoW Classic.
---
I mean it’s a point to be made, do they fix game breaking bugs even though it isn’t the classic experience?
---
Get something to level 99. Then use it.
---
Well, if I level my Druid first then Ill focus on farming/professions to help out alts. Also get some BiS gear incase I feel like raiding/PvPin.
---
If I level my Priest then BiS gear, Professions, and get farming alt up as I plan to raid with Priest.
---
Why would it make silly ? It seems reasonable blizzard could reward its faithful customers by giving them little bonuses like more chance to make it in betas if they want to participate.
---
I loved it, it’s the first expansion since tbc that got me addicted again.
---
You seem like a fun person to play with. The best players at the moment are top raiders from respected Private Servers, and the consensus is that Fury/Prot is still the best route. It will absolutely exist since it is the best way to push Speed Running times, and benefits the raid greatly. We just have to make small adjustments, and maybe the tank has to equip a shield a couple more times during a fight or when it extends past a certain point. The meta will change, but we will be entering all tiers of this content based on the private server meta at higher levels of play. For players on your level you can just wait for 3 sunders, and enjoy the game.
---
Lamo TOTC, you only get 50 wipes a lockout! 
---
I like wrath because I joined in wrath, but objectively I prefer Cata the most.
---
Feral Druid crafts itself a Bind on Pickup BiS tanking trinket at 265.

http://classicdb.ch/?item=11811
---
Oh we're doing it. Been practicing MC in greens, training our bodies for lack of sleep, shipping Adderall to each other. Our tanks will have at least 3 people leveling them. Though we have about 100+ people dedicated to the cause, we're always looking for more! And we have the best loot system. http://onslaught-wow.com
---
You will have fuck all rested xp but. They had max all the way.
---
I love how we're all adults now so when we do calculations for shit like this we ALWAYS account for eight whole hours NEEDED for sleep haha
---
For the record I agree
---
Maybe your side keeps losing because you suck.
---
If it makes you feel any better you can call Aggrammar layer 1 Aggrammar,  Aggrammar layer 2 Eonar, Aggrammar layer 3 Aman'Thul, Aggrammar layer 4 Golganneth, Aggrammar layer 5 Kaz'goroth, Aggrammar layer 6 Norgannon.  And on weekends and holidays during 7-10pm Aggrammar layer 7 Argus, Aggrammar layer 8 Azeroth.  Then they will server merge them all down and up depending on how many players log into a character on the named server Aggrammar and the time of day.
---
Well yeah, given the context or /r/classicwow, i was referring to the fact that Classic WoW exists now so obviously.. Blizzard has gotten back in touch with their fans. Poorly worded?
---
Damn you're gonna beat me I'm going for week two
---
&gt; this "fix" broke other things without intending to - like virtually   
---
&gt;any  
---
&gt; feeling of progression during leveling.
---
I would blame the lack of there not actually being any progression whatsoever. With or without level scaling.
---
60 isnt the end. This game has no end. The content is also time gated
---
Ah, yup, not in it then.  Sorry man!  Hopefully soon!
---
i'm considered casual and i play about 6-7 hours a night m-f, normally not Thursday as i'm out, and anywhere from 10-15 hours on a day on weekends, that's more hours than i do in my actual job that pays me money, but because i don't raid or constantly trying to upgrade my kit to the best it can be i'm a "casual" in the eyes of most retail players, back in vanilla i wasn't a hardcore raider, mainly as i liked to take my time and didn't get into a great guild when i got to the end game until in TBC but from that point on i was a hardcore raider up until the end of pandaria and i didnt play anywhere near as much as i do now, the perception of what makes you "hardcore" now days is heavily skewed
---
Get money get paid
---
Does this apply to players as well. As a warrior if I parry a hit, does my next attack come out faster?
---
It's a joke
---
I dont care if people butcher their experience by rolling on a 100.000viewer streamer server, but I will steer clear to have a vanilla experience and not a PoGChamp glorified stream chat.
---
If you are familiar with pserver APES pretty much broke the PvP scene on the latest pserver. One "hardcore" guild disbanded early and many who werent invested yet heavily winning team joined and went alliance. Half a horde premade vs 8-12premades full 15men on alliance side.
---
Double that and you will have a server with a big streamer on it. 
---
You set yourself up for a lot of hurt if you join such a server.
---
I believe I was level 21 here. 3 levels later I saw someone with a ghost saber cat from darkshore. Had to get that one so I said farewell to my starter cat.
---
It's in the game files. With the completed weapon stats and all but the questline wasn't implemented yet.
---
Sorry for the late reply, I went to sleep like an hour after making the thread.
---
Lol, actually I was planning on crashing at a friends place during this so no one will bug me or know the extent to which ill be playing this shit. Maybe I can get him to play a bit while I sleep. We live in CA and he likes weed a lot (I dont smoke anymore tho). I bet if I buy him some bud before coming he'll happily do it lmao. 
---
For practicing 1-60 you think this will work? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MosnSaLvAw&amp;list=LLHijeW3HwxOXY-TarpWAimA&amp;index=10&amp;t=0s or what would you recommend?
---
Thanks for the advice, you gave me some good ideas
---
Interesting. I'm going to be rocking a warrior as quickly as I can and I considered "help" while I tried to sleep. I'll give it a look.
---
&gt; Meanwhile I see horde streamers enjoying the best of classic with big  pvp fights and not complaining at all, whys that? Why is it always a  alliance player/streamer complaining about PvP? 
---
because you think streamers represent the classic community, while that in fact couldn't be farther from the truth.
---
I mean you can definitely have a good time as feral, but at the same time it isn't the strongest class/spec in classic, so you might have a hard time in pvp. It's fine in dungeons and raiding, it's just feral is really hard to play well as in pvp. But ay practice makes perfect, so if you put in enough hours, you can learn what the class is good at countering and ect. 
---
And for the mmo mouse, the on that I have used for the last year or so is the Corsair Scimitar. It is a really heavy mouse, heavier than most mice, but once you get used to the weight and moving it around its great! I has a nice scroll wheel, dpi buttons, good drivers, and my favorite part, it has 12 macro buttons on the side of the mouse, so you can really do a lot with it. And it isn't really expensive.
---
So yeah thats my bit on that, good luck, and I'll see you at Launch!
---
Lok'Tar Ogar!

My main tank had quit and we were only 3.. one healer, a dwarf warrior and me as a paladin. Then we spend the rest of the dungeon with me as tanker. 10 years ago and still epic
---
They still haunt me at night...
---
You're being down-voted hard but I'm with you on this. It doesn't take a genius to realize the dude standing next to him that invited him to a party probably wants to quickly kill the same boss spawn as him. You don't need to always communicate the obvious.  
---
He decided to be a jerk to you and only when you got the tag did he pretend to care. You are fine.
---
imagine giving yourself gold to make your post look better lmfao
---
Streamers and their base will be like 0.01% of the server pop at most. I wouldn’t worry about. Going to be millions of casual players doing whatever
---
O okay thx
---
lets say the eu-servers are in luxemburg or the netherlands, and you are on the us west coast, one trip is about ~10000-11000km ~6000km for the sea cables and the rest from maine (iirc the sea cables go to the US north atlantic backbone thats somewhere near there) to la.
---
10000km / 299792 km/s (speed of light in seconds) = 0.0334 s = 33,4ms
---
thats a one way trip considering best conditions without weird routing and problems.
---
take that times 2 because the real ping you will have is the round trip time and its a ping of 66,8ms.
---
im not up to date what the normal processing time on a blizz server is but lets give it a plain +10ms to consider the server processing time.
---
you will never achieve such a ping from la to eu-west because routing isnt straight, and theres processing time that accumulates on the way, you will probably have a ping of 100ms - 200ms, thats absolutely playable. 
---
(those timings are only achievable with optic fiber cables from target - target, so keep that in mind)
---
tl/dr: Best case scenario you have a 76ms ping (not really achievable), most of the time 130ms-200ms -&gt; playable but you will definetly feel the latency. 
---
if you want to be sure just ping an LA based server from where you are atm.
---
They are on stress test which was max level 10 this time around
---
Oh fuck off. What are you, 12?
---
Why do these pricks influence your choice of what faction to roll? It's a fucking absurd notion. They're all neckbeard wankers anyway.
---
are invites still being sent out?
---
I think it just changes the cap for glancing blows. The human/orc racials alone should still be worth just as much, but the racials + edgemasters for example might be less valuable (*might*, not sure on the exact math).
---
yeah but i still see allen brack as an individual human being voicing his honest opinion.
---
just watched the vanilla announcement (he had to announce it back then) and afterwards he says hes nervous about it, so he still wasnt entirely convinced then :D
---
This is autistic.. And yes they will fix bugs..
---
Hi, /u/Peeche94
---
Best in Slot
---
I really hope the information comes out as soon as possible so I can stay the hell away from streamers and legions of 13 year olds fan boys.
---
If blizzard bans spwan camping classic will die fast
---
Might have done the same with some items as a newb...
---
&gt; e.g poopstabber69
---
Fortunately, that name isn't valid anywhere. I'm really glad that Blizzard enforced alpha character names with the first letter capitalized only. I wish the RP rules applied everywhere, but it's better than nothing.
---
The only thing I'd be open to would be an apostrophe, so you could name your troll Vun'zar or something like that.
---
That would be a great way to do it. I'm really more concerned with how my character looks to me, not how I appear to everyone else. I'd be fine with my real gear showing to everyone else and my transmog appearance being only client side.
---
As many have said, it's easy to become a killing machine in PvP as hunter, even though its arguably the hardest class to really master.
---
A master hunter is truly a scary thing in PvP.
---
we are making a lot of assumptions here, did he mean 4-8 days played? 4 is very ambitious/not possible but other wise 8 days played is very doable 
---
also the amount of guides that exist now, many people who want to level can easily stay on track, wasting less time dilly dallying
---
Half my guild has no zone, and they aren't in 'our' guild chat.
---
How will you "abuse" the economy? Are we talking about farming mats for pre-raid gear and AHing? No one will have any money at first so it might be difficult. Only thing I can think of is farming the FUCK out of hot spots for pre-raid mats/pots etc and stacking it all inside the AH for few weeks before putting it up? 
---
Mmm, just trying to suss out your ways..
---
atiesh was the strangest item in game in terms of use, you do this massive quest chain and progression to basically get portal: kara, by the time you was 70 the stats on it were pointless and then they made it more pointless when they added the stonard portal spell
---
Transmog is one of the million things they’ve added that was incredible and I loved at the time, but in retrospect I truly dislike the effects of.
---
J!nx does blizzard wear better than blizzard does. A real shame.
---
Sound plan, makes two of us!
---
Honestly people like you act like everyone on the server is going to rush to 60, been playing on private serves, know how exactly to optimize their time to hit 60 fast. The truth of the matter is most people won't even make to 60 let alone Naxxramas.
---
And if you do max out your character and get bored with pvp and alts, then just quit the game. Doesn't mana you didn't enjoy it. Doesn't mean we need to make more content to a game that has an insane amount of gameplay to it.
---
It's like Skye in. I played it a lot. I made out a character, got highest rank in a lot of the guilds. But if I wanted i could do even more. Speed run a character, make a character totally different. I just decided I didn't want to. But if I did, just like vanilla wow, there's awalys going to be stuff to do.  Retail died a death of a thousands cuts, and that's why the "No changes" mantra is very important.
---
Even tipsout said that his true dream is a new mom with Vanlilla wow design principles and philosophy. We've all done it before. We played classic wow in 2005. And after we replay it, I honestly don't think BC or Wotlk is the way to go whatsoever. At least it won't be for me
---
So much misinformation in this thread. The meta has changed, and we have learned how to min/max Vanilla on private servers. If you somehow think that a Warrior will not be topping DPS even early in to MC, then you're just fooling yourself. Mages/Warlocks are very weak early on, Rogues are decent and so are Hunters. This Parry Change doesn't affect dps, and the dodge change is 1%. The only issue stemming from this is tps and damage, which is why Alliance will be stronger. On a casual level, top dps may be the person paying attention. At high levels of play it will continue to be warriors.
---
my favorite pre 60 instance by a huge mile. i guess it's everyone's favorite too.
---
You really think that the guy didn't know the the one other guy standing right next to him at a boss kill wanted credit? It's 100% obvious why they were both there. You don't always need to communicate the complete obvious.
---
Seniority systems are generally pretty terrible
---
There's just some streamers that are shit and some that are not. It's not faction related at all.
---
I don't think that you are right. I played that clip at 0.25 speed and it looks like the debuff from the bomb was applied before the projectile from the the frost bolt of the other player started. Take a look for yourself.
---
They have 3 months to iron it out, give them a chance to work on it.
---
and that makes human racial even more important! So goodbye Night Elf warrior tanks...
---
Ok, thanks, im glad it wont be too much longer!
---
I don't believe it is after looking over his website. I think they'll genuinely try. Whether they get there or not will be fun to watch.
---
they have plenty of viewers, if people start to follow what these clowns say, classic is gonna be lame
---
Do what you want, don't let the insanely small minority of the streamer players dictate what you want to do.
---
Also just as an anecdote I've seen both complaints and encouragement of PvP from streamers on Alliance and Horde, I don't think that opinion is unique to a faction by any stretch.
---
Except every other player will be following some sort of guide 
---
Making guides ironically useless at launch
---
Most people don’t raid.
---
If you win you’re happy, and if you lose you’re not happy.  
---
Generally horde have dominated the pvp scene.  So they’re strong in world pvp usually and most battlegrounds.  Also Asmongold tends to have ...more intense and emotional reactions to things than the average person.
---
I'd like to contribute my data from beta, but although my login works fine on the website, the wowhead client keeps refusing my credentials, has this issue been observed?
---
They are all really good games and had specific design choices that shaped the game as a whole. Vanilla's slower pacing and lack of degenerative quality of life 'improvements', TBC's move to keep much of vanilla's core but tune up difficulty/competitiveness, WotLK's step to focus more on narrative and much faster paced arena. A new expac that aimed to combine everything great about all 3 would be fantastic... but would you trust a modern actiblizzard who made BFA to craft such an expansion? I wouldn't. I hope they just release TBC and WotLK legacy servers, unaltered from the original games, at some point.
---
So they can’t talk in guild chat?
---
Or just yours?
---
Sure...2.5 TIMES more spikes in damage that will DRAIN healers mana if the tank is a Druid / Fury prot clearly doesn't mean anything for you...
---
You, and MANY like you (understandable, since most people here never played Vanilla, not spent 2-3 hrs/day on EJ trying to improve their guild raid progress...like I did) absolutely FAIL to realize what 2.5 times increase in SPKIE damage means for a Druids that is not Def capped, not have a shield, or a Fury Warrior tank with even less defense and also without a shield.
---
ANY hit can be a crit...2.5 times MORE parry-haste hits from a boss also translates into a higher chance for a crit proc. And Druids, while not entirely becoming irrelevant as raid boss tanks in Classic, like Fury Warriors, will still receive much more spike damage and much more often, than Prot Warriors.
---
Simply put...in Classic, raid boss tanks will be Prot Warriors, Druid tanks will be off-tanks in some super casual guilds, and Fury Warriors will be for the luls.
---
The VAST majority of the guilds will tackle raids with 2 Prot Warriors as MTs and 1 Druid / 3rd Prot or Fury Warrior (with tank gear and shield) as OT.
---
AS IT WAS BACK IN VANILLA.
---
&gt;Wanting people to X
---
&gt;Policing
---
Yes I'm glad we could clear up the definition for you.
---
There's nothing more terrifying than a screaming brutish hooded orc suddenly appearing behind your silly ass, go for the orc my man.
---
they are meant to be farmed $$$$

Isn't that a federal offense?

Hi, /u/EyewarsTheMangoMan, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
It aint green or furry, it ain't horde.
---
You think you don't want Layering but you do.
---
Not a bug, some abilities scale with level.  
---
The amount each ability scales can be found by datamining the client, the Battle Shout Rank 1 points per level value is 0.5, so every 2 levels it increases by 1.
---
Only 3.6 Roentgen- not great, not terrible.
---
Hehe hope you reported it
---
How do you know he did that?
---
Before that with the graves. Going around clicking all the clickables. Death soon followed. On the stairs though terror when the fight started and hordes of trolls started spawning. I hate ZF to this day still. BRD and WC are my two fav dungeons of all time. I ran wc so many times I knew the path like the back of my hand.
---
5 healers? Bwl will be a struggle and aq40 literally not doable.
---
You quit just as content gets harder. 
---
Everyone knows MC and zg are a piece of piss.
---
Playing is testing. Blizzard has paid QA testers. We are beta participants. They are not the same thing.
---
It's the raid dps check part, it's designed for a 40 man raid. I highly doubt you'll pass this guy on less than 30 man if highly geared, let alone fresh out of mc
---
I have found over a dozen bugs just leveling normally but paying extra attention. you need the full range of testers. You want the people who test the normal case, and the people who try to break it. One isn't better than the other. As long as the people "Just playing" the game are still noticing bugs and reporting them, or hell are just playing so they can have a server with a population on it that is still useful.
---
The best world PvP the game ever saw was in TBC. Isle of Quel Danas was the best world PvP the game ever had.
---
Alliance cucks
---
&gt; others care a great deal. It's okay to be either one.
---
No it isn’t. Beta isn’t the all important have to be in it event you people think it is.
---
This is also the person who decided to do the NGE for Galaxies.
---
I don't understand how this is a surprise to anyone? There are tons of sources for \~15% parry on +3. It's even on the wikis for later expansions.  
---
The only mechanic that changed in any major way untill cata is weaponskill and thus glancing blow (TBC) when they introduced expertise.   
---
All TBC servers that I know of run with 15% parry and 9% hit. Sure it's off slightly but if anything the revealed blizzard numbers are lower.  
---
The thing I'm surprised about is the crit supression - that don't seem right. 1% per level makes no sense really as it should just be modified by weaponskill/defense skill difference like most other stats. Most theorycrafting I've seen puts crit supression around 0.6%- 1.5% which is way off from 3% - that would be a pretty major difference compared to how little parry and miss is off from the theorized values.
---
Play what looks cool, it won’t matter in the end.
---
I will go in without following any quest helpers or guides. Sure, I will probably have to use ~~thottbot~~ google every now and then but I am not gonna rush it in Classic. 
---
Me and my friend group are aiming at clearing every dungeon while leveling. (RFC and WC included) I have tried min-maxing but I just burn out and stop enjoying the game super fast that way.
---
&gt; how out of touch Blizzard had become from the fans 
---
am i retarded or doesnt it actually exactly say what youre meaning? it doesnt imply that blizzard got back in touch with their fans at any time?
---
Look at all these people who think they do, but don’t!
---
Some people value a challenge more so than a story/experience (or they’ve experienced most of the story and role playing elements of vanilla already). 
---
Humans have competed with one another since antiquity; competition is deeply rooted in our evolutionary heritage. Many people enjoy the game by clearing hard content, things like their first urbs clear in green gear, or getting that ony server first kill, or even just being the top dps in their friend group. 
---
It’s like playing chess in a club. There will be some people there who like to talk and socialize and make friends and they might not care about the competition very much, but many people are there to experience the joy of winning and thrill of outsmarting their opponent. Neither is enjoying chess club the wrong way, they are both valid ways of enjoying a chess club.
---
Gonna do PvP server, especially since im a Rogue XD. Im mainly interested in raiding but im sure at some point Ill want to cause a little trouble out there in world PvP. 
---
And yea, grinding will be mind numbing but at least after a week or so it'll be over. Well, not really since Ill have to run dungeons and farm professions, but I wont have do those at too insane of a pace at least.
---
We really have no idea what they are going to do post phase 6 (naxx)
---
and ill bet neither do they
---
I believe it's totally on the hunter to position their pet correctly. They run towards a mob then begins attacking based on where the hunter was positioned.
---
Pservers are tuned to be harder than vanilla
---
The elite mobs (not counting bosses) do about the half the damage compared to private servers, so it's quite easy.
---
Lol use feint man. Vanish has a longer cd. If vanish is on cd and you’re pushing threat do you stop attacking or work in a feint?
---
I've been watching their big world pvp battles from both sides at the same time. Alliance players (streamers) ALWAYS say "They had way more people, that's why they won." even when the horde side has fewer people in their single raid group haha.
---
Don't get me wrong, I will try to get the best gear I can get. But I will need to find the right people to "grind" and have fun with. 
---
What killed WoW for me is everyone only looking at gear score and rejecting people with lower gear score assuming that they were shit at the game.
---
I am an elitists regarding progression and understanding that you need to start at point A to go to point B. I remember when I first grinded MC with my guild and everyone had shit gear, it was hard but it was fun.
---
Then we switched to two Raid groups A and B, Raid A was the top geared people and Raid B was people that needed to be helped and coaching.  I switched from Raid A to B to help people that did not had time like I did to practice etc...
---
I enjoyed helping someone else getting to the end game, some people were regarding that as "leeching" on the guild progression, but I never seen it that way.
---
That's my only big fear with Classic, I don't have the time to grind like I used to. I might fall last picked even with ton of PVP/PVE experience behind my belt.
---
exactly.. is it possible that there is a bug because retail wow (and this new client) have level scaling? Maybe there is not enough parry/dodge/miss/glancing blows due to the level disparity because the game "thinks" they are "equal level"?
---
Disagree, I much preferred the Crossroads and Orgrimmar Raids
---
" objectively better class and raid design "  
---
You dont know what objectively means. I honestly think doing nothing but spam 5 minute blessings as a paladin is the best class design we've seen in wow, period. See? Your subjective opinion is just that.
---
Pservers were tuned to be harder than vanilla classic wow
---
Sounds perfect to me. People that know their shit have their spots where they can grind in peace and it will scare of the retail-plebs because they can't play WoW on their Phone

Putting together a BiS set is great, but it's not 30% better than it's secondary alternative.  The ilvl difference between T1 and T2 is 10 ilvl.  That's it.
---
Stat-wise, some of that ilvl budget was put on resistances, or may have increased spirit(i.e. T1 Mage belt vs. T2 mage belt , both 20 int, T2 has 2 more stam, 3 more spirit and 10 shadow resistance instead of fire resistance)
---
On top of that, your BiS gear may have an item desired by 15 other people in your raid, and you might see it a couple times throughout the time that raid is "current".  The Tailoring robe, Robe of the Archmage, is BiS for mages until AQ40 ...
---
Does that mean a mage without that robe is useless?  Of course, there are alternatives that are good, just not *as* good, and usually the difference is relatively small.
---
Vanilla rewards continuing to improve one character gear-wise.  Not everything great comes from raids.  A lot does, but there's plenty of completely relevant content that rewards good gear that has nothing to do with a raid, and that's part of what makes Vanilla's RPG experience so much better than what's currently available.
---
But if they added arena with no rewards just rank that be cool way down the way that is

If you catch a rogue and dot him, he has to wait for dot to go away to be able to vanish. Even if he does vanish, he just blew one of his key cooldowns to stunlock rotation. Unless the rogue is pure damage spec with ambush, he won't be any threat, as he won't stunlock you... Remember context here is STV, not endgame with preparation, thristle teas, etc...
---
ah thanks for the help!
---
What's the joke? Given the context of the pic (dad took apart a malfunctioning coffee grinder and found it was plugged with coffee) I don't get it. Is wow classic the coffee? Or the grinder? And why?
---
Which had no flying.
---
I forgot about this lol
---
To some yes, but my friends all quit in Legion because they pruned and changed the classes so much that it did not feel like the class and style they used to play. I am not saying it was bad at all, but it was such a massive change to the game that a there are people that did not like it.
---
Razer's naga trinity is what I use. It has interchangeable parts. You can have the normal 2 side buttons, or you and swap it out for 7/12 buttons. I love it.
---
entirely false.

Thanks for giving me a false choice. I'll still take removing bugs and, exploits for 1000 Trebeck.

Gordok Ogre Suits baby
---
Why? It's fairly easy. I can do 1-6 in around 25 minutes, 6-12 2 hours and by this time I should be little ahead of the pact.
---
I might burnout, that's the only variable that could affect the timeframe but if I don't, I reckon 5 days, the maths adds up.
---
Haha right on man probably gonna go for the blood fang set
---
Rogue, also a dime a dozen. That said, 3 spots of any decent premade WSG is rogues. They have way too much utility.
---
I actually started on the tail end of Vanilla right when BC came out and had plenty of good memories from it. I'm really looking forward to Classic when that comes out. Why does it sound like you have to defend something? I'm not bashing on anything, and simply said that I enjoy retail when some people don't. 
---
I experienced the long grind for gear and how rewarding it was back in the day. Don't get me wrong, it felt awesome and actually rewarding. But that was when I had all the time in the world. Now I feel like I can hop on and play casually and get some pretty good gear and actually enjoy the game for what it is, and not feel like I have to put in hours and hours of play time.
---
"No wonder you enjoy it."

---
So you're gonna sit on the low level enchanting mats for months instead of putting that capital to work? 
---
Good call mate.
---
BC was the first time I hated the game. Mainly because of Arena and Blizzard treating WoW like an Esport back then instead of what it used to be.
---
It will be in the game till P2 so atleast 3 months. After 8 days IRL i'll be lvl 60 and stockpile so much Arcane crystals and black lotus that i and the other nerds that'll do this can fuck the economy of the Server for a year
---
It's not the merging that I see to be the problem - players will just login one day and everybody will be in the same layer, or if they're online at the time I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be a big deal. But the longer they stick around, the greater chance where stuff like what's described here can happen - two groups expecting some world PvP, but they don't even see each other. What if a bunch of lvl 35 Horde gather in Northern STV and decide they are going to mess with Darkshire, and word spreads among the Alliance, so everybody flies down there - but if they wind up on different layers, they won't even see the town being ravaged on another layer. Or if a full raid group of 60's wants to take out a city boss, and nobody is around to defend the city gates on the layer where the attackers have their group.
---
We hope that’s how it works.
---
What we have seen in the beta and seen on live with their sharding technology is that, at times you very well may see someone from Medivh on stormreaver.
---
Blizzard has had trouble disabling crz and sharding on RP realms like they have promised. They also have had issues in the beta with people from other realms popping up.
---
I hope they get it worked out so it works like they want it to. It’s however a very real possibility that it won’t ever be like it should and you may periodically see someone from other realms.
---
Imagine if they tested it on a beta realm or stress test...
---
&gt; I've always maintained 2 accounts,
---
Why ?
---
/u/conversionbot 38.5 Degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit
---
Maybe this distinction is arbitrary, but looking up a problem on classicdb or thottbot is research, but following a guide all the way is mindless. There's a big difference to me.
---
You can choose how you look. You just can't magically make one piece of gear look like something completely different.
---
yeap I know.. but we are talking about 6 level difference here with the boss and players in white gear. DPS shouldnt be able to do damage due to lots of parry/miss/dodge and healer mana should end at 3-4 skills. 
---
We are not talking about some balancing numbers here, this is clearly couldnt happen in vanilla.
---
Orc you get more melee damage when you use blood fury and hardiness helps in pvp because of 25% resistance to stuns. Undead is great too tho, breathe underwater, cannibalize, and will of forsaken makes you immune to charm, fear, and sleep. Depends on what you want to do, if you're just going to pvp, I'd go undead, but if you want to do solid in pve and pvp I'd go Orc.
---
I swear, the people begging in Elwyn last night for an invite to Asmon's raid was truly pathetic.
---
Same, but we're not used to barrel rolling 200 meters with our panda
---
I think the main reason the ZG bats weren't used or atleast talked about as much as BT is because they weren't available for the entire expansion. I haven't fact-checked this but I think they nerfed their attack speed after a certain patch or that they were just broken on pservers.
---
But please correct me if I'm wrong, getting a ZG bat is alot easier than camping BT spawn with the other 5k hunters
---
I'm no vanilla raiding guru but considering the fact that you didn't step foot in BWL yet wanted to go AQ40... I don't really know... How would have that turned out ?
---
the hardest part is finding 39 other dedicated players.
---
I for one am excited for the entire pacakged, which hasnt been the case for a long time
---
i typically for the past couple expacs either chose 1 or 2 of the following 
---
*raiding
---
*pvp
---
*crafting

I agree with people being burned out. Classic will be a nice change.
---
Fair, I really only play WoW for dungeons raids and pvp, so I respect that.
---
You guys don't have phones?

Some would say this is the point of a beta and stress test 😊

Yeah the only stuff that will be left out will be things like the yojamba ZG raid quests, AQ quests in silithus, Naxx stuff in EPL. All the later-added hubs that weren't raid related will be in from the get-go.

Excuse me, this picture seems oddly familiar. What guild is this?
---
Quiver only affects the auto shot speed,has no affect on aimed shot cast time.
---
The true Warchief, My Warchief. Was purging the mongrel races from the Horde. Before he was cut down and, betrayed by honor less dogs like Thrall. (still bitter Thrall cheated in a duel of honor and, no one at Blizzard acknowledges that lol)
---
Yes, yes he did.
---
Has Blizzard said when Stress servers go down today? I can’t find any info on the shutdown time
---
It'll be funny when classic has ten times more players and all those games put together.
---
&gt; That, or tank healers going OOM in 30 seconds. Which is the same shit anyway.
---
Not a problem if you kill the boss in 30 seconds :D

It's definitely not as balanced as retail, but you get what you ask for with a druid.  A truly hybrid class that can easily change to fit any role, just not quite as good as classes that specialize in any given role.  As long as you don't limit yourself to only understanding how to play a certain role, you'll do fine.
---
Feral's aren't great at PVP in general, but do have some advantages when it comes to 1v1 situations.  They also make great flag carriers in WSG.  But other classes will outshine them in large scale PVP.  What makes druids unique though is that you can change roles to fill in gaps of your group where needed.  Get grouped with a beefed up warrior and decent dps?  Swap out and provide heals for them.  Might not be as good heals as a dedicated healer, but the flexibility is there.
---
In PVE, ferals can tank 5 mans easily, but in higher level raids, they mostly get pushed into off-tank roles in favor of Warrior main tanks. Feral DPS is a bit lackluster, but again, the flexibility is where they shine.  Healer gets killed or oom?  Feral druid can pop off a couple heals and brez/innervate the healer.  Feral DPS druids may not have topped charts, but they have definitely saved groups from wiping countless times.
---
Play what makes you happy.  I'm personally going to be playing a feral druid as well.
---
Also I have both of these:

The flexibility (lol) of the razer is nice, but I usually just use the corsair (you can adjust it to your hand).
---
HALF??? Oh man :-(
---
Word.  I'd rather just roll the race that I want, rather than level to 40 with something I don't like and then reroll, and then lose interest because I'm so far behind the guild &gt;&lt;
---
thank you for understanding. I am not a troll and never have been one. 
---
Pretty much sure i am being downvoted not for inviting without words, cuz i’m sure everyone does it. I’m being downvoted for stating that vanilla will have it’s flaws on vanilla fansub
---
He was on a panel alongside all his other team members, and is now president of the company. They wouldn't have promoted him if they didn't feel that he represented the company's best interests, just as they wouldn't have trusted to have him on the panel if they didn't feel his answers aligned with their team. I believe his answer was 100% in the same vein as what the other members of the team would've given at the time; a resounding no to classic servers.
---
It is doable, infact the game is ment to be easier according to beta testers. Running Hunter, 4days is very easy. I reckon Joana and some others will do it in less ;)
---
* **Worlds Best** will do it in **3-4 days**.
---
* **Super fast** will be in **5-8 days**.
---
* **Fast** in **9-12 days**.
---
* **Average** in a **month**
---
* **Slow** within **4-8 months**
---
Overwatch isn't going too badly, outside of the competitive ladder kind of being a mess, which isn't super easy to fix, they have implemented a number of hugely requested complex features recently with both the workshop and replays.
---
Little urban elites - Draenor
---
more so fun, if it truely is easier people can more likely play a more lax spec that they like, rather than be forced into a spec
---
imagine..... ret paladins in a raid?
---
Everyone can do what they want. But I can also think it’s silly/foolish.
---
Gotta have the jaws music in the backround slowing building up to be louder.
---
Couldn't that also just be a product of floating point rounding error. Either the reporting tool or the actual function charged with determining if an attack missed could have rounded somewhere along the lines (due to 4 byte constraint) that in turn causes anomalies such as this? I like that answer better than the one given.
---
It's important to note that that person went on to become president of blizzard.  
---
But what he is saying is taken out of context.  He was saying was they can't just re-release the game because the infrastructure around the game was too dated, too easy to exploit, and too costly to support.  This is the reason they ended up porting the game to the modern client.  Without being able to do this blizzard would have never done a classic wow.  We have some very savvy software engineers to thank for being able to port the game to the modern client.  This is why they spent so long talking about how they ported the game to the modern client.  Without this crucial step classic would have never happened.
---
Everyone telling you to go orc is planning to play alliance priest/lock.
---
For me? Obviously you have a misunderstanding about my post.
---
You do realize that without layering it would be this, or equal ammount of people in queues, right?
---
I mean...yeah, duh. Like this is so obvious idek what you're saying.
---
I like how the night elves stick out lol
---
They are generally unaffected by the announcement. The big thing from +5 weapon stats has to do with how glancing blows work, and has little impact on hit capping.
---
As oppose to Redditors on classic wow who aren't "neckbeard wankers"?
---
Sul'Thraze might be OK if you managed to get it at level 44 which is the earliest it's equippable, but you'll probably have to run ZF a dozen times before you get both pieces so you're not gonna be 44 when you get it. 
---
Ice Barbed Spear is so superior and so easy to obtain it's kind of a joke.
---
Yes. Because they've been over this with the RFK post. They have all the values and everything working as intended. Pservers are not the comparison to use for instance. Mobs in dungeons do half as much damage in vanilla, pservers over tuned them. Bosses were over tuned by around 20% also.
---
Undead look awesome in rogue sets, orc does not suit rouge at all imho
---
oooh okay.
---
I dunno judging by the outrage of people over things being off or not like pservers. People claiming blizzard is wrong on this that and the other thing, as well as an inability to admit maybe their memories are flawed when blizzard “confirms” things. I would say that it isn’t exactly wrong, nor right.
---
Is there a way of telling the person who did it 4 expansions later apart from the person who actually cleared it at the time it was relevant?
---
You got it in 6 hours? Nice. I remember trying for a while and just ended up giving up
---
The druid playerbase was a single digit percentile in vanilla. The vast majority have no idea what they are talking about, literally.
---
If you want to play a druid it's going to be fine man, you will still be able to do whatever you want.
---
Lol, that's exactly me when I'm looking at my old WOW screenshots ! :D
---
Shaman can run ele/resto and "never" respec. Quickest way would be few mail spellpower pieces from MC/BWL and rest ZG/AQ20/CC blues and alike.
---
Oh, it wasnt who i thought then. I guess no transmogs makes people look way more similar when they all have high end gear
---
Why are you gate keeping what's "fun" for other players? Some players like the leveling experiences. Some players have already done that and want to focus on PvP and raiding. 
---
The real question is why do *you* care how other people enjoy the game?
---
this sounds familiar, though i'm not sure what abilities specifically increased 'invisibly'.  there were a few tooltips that didn't even give flat numbers so you had to figure it out
---
Search this sub for the beta pictures of mounted characters with -alphatesting  next to their name. It’s not misinformation it’s truth.
---
&gt; but you somehow learned how to fly in extra harsh conditions before you could fly in normal weather, which was super weird and nonsensical.
---
I hate flying as a whole, but you didn't learn anything to fly in EK/Kalimdor. You had to buy a licence to fly.
---
100% gilded himself. Imagine a world.
---
Filled with content, good class design, everyone had something to do, great art, just an overdose of greenfire though, the legion theme got me turning the music off for most the xpac, out of the broken isles... Excellent xpac in my view though
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Modern raids have many more mechanics that engage all roles in the group in order to succeed.
---
Hunter, feral/resto druid.
---
So J. Allen Brack is Vince McMahon.
---
That still wouldn't be affected by the announcement though, which was just confirming 8% hit cap, as opposed to the theorized 8.6 or 9%. It doesn't change the value of +5.
---
This resonates that you would actually recognize people by character name. People were known for their achievements in game. When you saw someone with a full tier set, legendary weapon, and that impossible to achieve title, you knew this guy was a badass who put in the time and effort.
---
Ah, so if you draw a line between the player and the mob, the pet would position itself on that line? Makes sense.
---
Ah yes, of course, the mythical "Classic will bring everyone who ever left WoW back" statement.
---
You're right. I should have added BWL. We only did about half of it, if that.
---
If you’re okay with healing, go priest.
---
I have a phone. But I also have a very expensive computer I use to play video games at the max capacity.
---
I’m honestly not sure what layering even is lol
---
well with I would go healer of some kind, guilds always need more skilled healers
---
Other way around, If you put points into increased battle shout talent the tool tip would for example say 250 AP but the buff itself would only say 190.
---
You actually have no idea what that word means lmao. No, it is not objectively true in any sense of the word.
---
Druid. In raids you’ll mostly heal but there usually isn’t more than 4 druids per raid so it’s very easy to get decked out fast. There can be a place for a feral Druid too if you learn power shifting and are very good
---
They’re also one of the best levellers because of travel form etc
---
As for PvP they’re the best flag carriers for WSG and a good fc will always be wanted
---
Yeah, I agree. Also, I have followed guides before but they just turn leveling into a chore for me. I do understand people using guides but they are just not for me.
---
Not from a blood elf
---
And this would be suitable enough for healing pve (at a fairly casual level nothing too hardcore) as well as melting faces in pvp?
---
I believe a Tauren female has a slightly smaller hit box than a male, I’m not 100% sure on this though
---
I was playing on a pve server so there was no world pvp since southshore/tarrens mill(and crossroads before that) and that was pretty dope in vanilla.
---
Even though I played alliance, I had a level 36 troll rogue on a different server who permanently stayed in moonbrook to wreck people trying to form VC groups. It was a great way to let off steam and develop a horrible reputation. I must have ruined hundreds of lowbie groups trying to make the run to the vc entrance.
---
Then it's absolutely not working as intended. Report it, move on.
---
We had about 6 druids and 3-4 ret paladins in our raids pretty regularly and cleared all content.
---
What? Level scaling is fine in modern WoW. Sure, it shouldn't exist in older WoW, but it's probably one of the best things added to the game in a long time. I feel like people are just going down this hate-train because of what a couple Youtubers said about level scaling while they're comparing it to Classic. Or, BFA's horrendous 110-120 level scaling which made you feel weaker as you leveled.
---
From 1-110, level scaling really isn't an issue. If anything, it's an improvement based on how modern WoW works. There's so many zones, and so many quests people have never done because they'd out-level that zone and move on to the next one as soon as the quests became green/grey. I leveled some characters with level scaling and I loved going through any zone I wanted to almost whenever I wanted. I actually love the idea. It works in modern WoW and hate when people are trying to hate on something that really doesn't deserve the attention. There's worse things in modern WoW to make posts about.
---
People keep saying "You should feel stronger as you level up. Level scaling just makes you feel weaker."  - What? In the old way, you'd never feel stronger as you leveled up because you'd just go to the next zone and become weak again, in an almost similar way that people are complaining about. (Are people just thinking about 110-120? Has anyone even leveled from 1-110 in this thread?)
---
In the old way (in modern WoW), you'd basically do the same zones everytime, doing the same route and moving onto the next zone at the same time. Level scaling allows you to experience a whole zones quest-line, or do Westfall at level 50 because why the hell not? If I want to do Pandaria from 80-90, I can do that. That's wonderful. In modern WoW this is great and we shouldn't be getting mad at Blizzard for making an interesting (and risky) change to the game.
---
The retail hate band-wagon is going off the rails at this point.
---
Oh, and this is coming from someone who loves Classic WoW.
---
I think 3 manning dungeons would be a great experience for your family
---
be sure to have fishing and cooking as well. 
---
for 3 mans paladin would be the best bet for healer, i suggest she goes ret for seal of command and pursuit of justice, and use a 2 hander. Going after verigans fist for your wife could be a very epic story for your family as well.  same goes for whirlwind axe for you
---
Is that the reddit gold thing? I'm pretty new to reddit. I didn't do it. Not sure how it even works.
---
By todays standards people agree that the very first boss encounter that is actually difficult is Chromaggus and upwards from there it is sometimes easier, often a lot harder. MC, AQ20 and ZG were always entry raids even in vanilla.
---
You really cant compare MC and Ony with the likes of Sapph in which positioning makes or breaks the fight while on Rag you need to move 5 feet every couple seconds and then move back in again.
---
Hell AQ20 is pretty much pushover apart from Ossirian and is barely more difficult than UBRS mechanic wise.
---
I wiped more on Drakkisath than on Ossirian.
---
You are basically telling us that LFR is pisseasy completly ignoring harder content like high level Mythic + dungeons.
---
I think it's a perfectly fair question.
---
&gt;And yes they will fix bugs..
---
I'm a bigger fan of BC, but since I hit 60 right as it released I never really saw vanilla endgame content. Wasn't that big of a fan of wrath at all.
---
As a healer, I find this statement completely false.
---
This. This right here.
---
You got me good.
---
Doing a test also appeals to the playerbase and its theorycrafters whereas had they just cited the reference client without tested proof people might not have believed it.
---
it would be half the people with layering actual functioning
---
I agree completely. 
---
I just find it irritating when I say that I enjoy BfA, and then people start attacking you for liking retail WoW.
---
It's like lasagna. Everything is separated but it all goes in one belly. Then after all the nutrients (wow tourist) get absorbed by the body it comes out as one big poop. A consolidated lasagna with no layers.
---
Identity was a very big part of why you’d be invested in a character.
---
Ya, we only did several bosses in BWL.
---
loved all the dungeons through Vanilla , they felt epic and is part of games nostalgic allure. if I get 10% of the feels I got in 2005 I will be a happy man
---
Yes, I am quite excited.     
---
      
---
It's super thematic to be riding to a raid and have all/most of your orcs riding wolves, or your dwarves riding rams. It feels cohesive, while simultaneously making the more fringe cases of gnomes riding nightsabers stand out that much more.      
---
          
---
I'm also glad to be rid of transmog. I'm mainly glad transmog is gone because it had an identity-erasing effect on a piece of gear. It eliminated what little self-conceit  we had that an item in wow was an actual, 'physical' item and cemented that they are, in actuality, just a block of stats in code.        
---
Get a new dagger, run over to the mog-man, poof! It's your old dagger. What's changed? "Oh I got 25 more crit rating and 5 ilvls". So soulless. It may not be much, but attaching an unchanging appearance to the item made it so you were using  *that item*, and not just upgrading stats on what you have as if it were an artifact weapon or something.       
---
It helps keep the RP of the world more intact - you don't live in a world where there are 'ilvl 825' swords floating around to slot in on a whim. You're living in a world where there is a fabled blade, guarded deep within Molten Core, and when you obtain it and use it you're using *that blade*. It's not just a stat upgrade, it is made "real" within the game world.       
---
         
---
I think looking like molting adolescent birds for much of the experience is well worth it in order to root item identity in the game world's reality with unchangeable models for those items.
---
try not to get ahead, itll keep you from being a basement dweller if you only play when they are on, plus the content would be much more challenging if you werent too much ahead.
---
Wrong - please catch up with where the meta has gone in the last 15 years. Armor capped druids with giant hp pools don’t die to crushing blows.
---
No. Bugs are part of the classic experience. Wall jumping is a thing why wouldn't this
---
k troll. You got blocked, so gz
---
My problem is I can't find a vanilla client download without torrents. Fml.
---
There will come a time where alt hunters are strutting around with Thunderfury.  Eventually raids will hold no meaning, and PvP will be the main game.
---
So what is the diff with layering and sharding?
---
I don't know how to do that or what that even is.
---
BC introduced 2 of the 3 most damaging concepts to WoW
---
**Flying mounts** (BC)
---
**Abandoned old zones** (BC)
---
LFG tool (Wrath)
---
Every server starts out with it's on lasagna with a different amount of meat and noodles. Then, once the dish is at capacity the chef cooks it.
---
There's a great spreadsheet that shows best in slot gears for both specs to give you an idea as to what you're going for. (when I get home I'll come back and post it)
---
The two specs could share the same build with a point or two going either way depending on how you wanted to play.
---
You're biggest concern will be gearing. In vanilla there were "increases damage and healing" and "increases healing" where the healing boost was significantly large than the damage boosts. So if you needed to heal you'd want to switch your SD gear to heal gear to get the extra SP.
---
Healing was built around mana regen and +heal.
---
Ele was built around Spell dmg and crit%/hit%.
---
If you're purely wanting to play as ele, you won't have to worry about this.
---
The mallet only gets you one extra boss.  The problem is the playerbase didn't see it as an extra boss, but a boss, and so the mallet is required (or else why bother running).
---
I'd also argue that the bosses (especially the stair boss) are harder than Jintha'alor.
---
All I can think about is how easy it would be to drop a few arcane explosions into the middle of that. My inner horde is screaming.
---
I was on Horde and thought the Trolls were part of an NPC event to help us kill what I had heard was "that Godzilla thing" at the end of the instance. So I ran down the stairs when they spawned.
---
Group was not amused.
---
I want to say same about WotLK but then again celestial steed was a thing
---
Chernregan
---
A good 90% of the armor in classic is *hideous* looking.  
---
But like...honestly that's kind of the point. It's bizarrely endearing how stupid everybody looks.
---
Shaman Warrior is a solid leveling duo
---
Then they should just give up the Ghost.
---
Pull it, move on.

---
I am not arguing about the damage numbers, which I agree that blizzard have the correct values. I am just wondering how DPS could damage a 6 level higher boss. Maybe the way that doge/parry/miss/resist is calculated is wrong because new client supports level scaling on retail. Just a question, not saying I know better.
---
I too submitted a bug for this - random mobs not showing up as skinnable, when my skinning skill was for sure high enough (65 points in skinning, on a level 8 mob).
---
I only saw it happen a few times, but I F6'd that shit so fast each time.
---
Also seeing that i've downvoted you before, this is not the first time you're a fucking retard in this subreddit either.
---
Horde has always been the PvP faction
---
i feel mage is better, it doesnt seem he wants to play with other people so much, I understand it as he wants to 3 man dungeons.
---
Also mages can use port and make food and water, and have the strongest aoe, which they will need. If you are only going to have 1 dps i say mage is the best, soley due to aoe
---
Why all the hate towards my NE rogue lol
---
That's incorrect from what I remember, for example if I gave arcane intellect buff to someone, then leveled up, then gave the buff to myself the amount of intellect received from the buff should not change.
---
It should only change once you rank the spell up from a class trainer.
---
If he hadn't made that statement we probably wouldn't be getting classic.  
---
The statement raised the issue for even people who hadn't been playing WoW.
---
We wiped my first time. A lot. I don’t think we even finished this part and then I got into a second group with a more knowledgeable tank 😂
---
You just described the Vanilla gaming model...
---
Brack went into detail about why "we didn't want legacy WoW" in that answer. He basically reeled off a list of great things they'd removed from the game as justification for his answer, in a REALLY smarmy and patronising fashion. He was wrong.
---
It wasn't just what he said. It was how he said it too.
---
Since you are so sure of yourself, let me ask you this simple question then: How exactly is it better?
---
Shaman/Paladin imo. Basically anything that can heal would greatly increase leveling speed by lowering downtime and being able to nearly insta-fill parties with dps
---
"PVP was awful and broken" = "my class wasnt OP"
---
Huh it's almost like maybe that's what the beta is for? Just a thought.
---
Overwatch is pretty succesful and it was fun when I played it, definitely worth the money IMO (not going to go into esports, just talking about the base game).
---
Also D2 was made by blizzard north which pretty much was a different company and only shared the name.
---
Just because you are Fury doesn't mean Battle Stance is useless.
---
I'd say any Warrior spec can benefit greatly from Tactical Mastery.
---
You are out of your goddamn mind LOL.
---
Have you thought about what races you want to play? If you want to play together from the start it is easier if you are all the same. To me the group comp seems good. I would maybe change from paladin to priest but that might be more of a personal thing. As for professions it all depends on what you aim for at the endgame if it is pve you want going herb alchemy on healer is nice if you want more of pvp you all want engineering. In that case I would level whit one each of the gathering professions. Whit herb on healer and skinning in warrior. Using tailoring on mage and prists if that is your choice going engineering on warrior and paladin. Then dropping tailoring ones you have crafted bop chest at 60 and picking engineering on all 3 characters
---
Sharding is like that scene from Cloverfield Paradox (spoiler] where the girl winds up in the walls from another dimension she was suddenly yanked from.
---
It's an imperfect solution to a modern problem to a massive world making it feel less empty. Layering will have full worlds and when removed an attempt at a stable server population without the necessary server mergers of last.
---
Legion gutted the game and game players temporary power in artifact trees, weapons, and legendaries that they obviously weren't going to keep. It was fun if you had good RNG but it was a terrible choice to reduce every class to a shell and have temporary boons fill in the blanks to make the class feel good. Even still with all that some classes felt pretty basic in the sense that you were shoehorned into a specific playstyle. Legion was when they decided to stop trying to make an RPG and make some sort of Diablo action game in Azeroth.
---
afaik a full R14 went for 3.000- 4000$ when farmed by chinese sweat shops on pservers.
---
Imagine the cost by actual western or even eastern european sellers.
---
The fact that they made Tauren hitboxes bigger to begin with is a good sign that model swapping with deviates, noggen, orb, ect will indeed function properly in regards to hitbox size. As far as video proof of someone doing it, I haven't seen it yet. It's first on my list during stress test windows tho.  
---
Females and Males have the same hitbox.
---
Which also made no sense, because how the hell is the Flightmaster's Union preventing me from mounting my Netherdrake in the middle of nowhere, and why do I care about some kind of air traffic violation when my life is on the line?
---
Paladins are awesome in pvp and can really help a hunter kite and run around with blessing of freedom and hoj on enemies. But they have a harder time healing a moving target that wants to kite. 
---
A shaman is better with mobility and will also offer lots to help the hunter through grounding totems and frost shocks. Spirit wolf will help you keep up better. The downside is that hunters dont synergize well with windfurry totem so you will be missing out on a lot of wasted potential. 
---
I think druids are the best because they can kite just as well or better than a hunter so you can both just run around opponents. This will work well if you insect swarm and moonfire people to help with dps. Your entangling roots will save the hunter from melee as well. Hots are great for kiting so again this synergize the best. Another main reason is your ability to stealth. A hunter can do well on their own so you can wait and hold back until he absolutely needs you. 
---
You can open in cat form to stun and put minor bleeds on people. The start doting and healing. This will cause lots of confusion and chaos for anyone who thought they were about to fight a lone hunter.
---
There is a certain convenience that guides can provide to even the most experience leveler. I recently leveled on a Pserver and lvl 30 in the beta, and I leveled 4 60's in vanilla, all Horde chars. So it's fair to say that I'm familiar with all the quest I intend to do and what I'll need to do exactly for each quest.
---
However, I could in no way recall every quest from memory or in what order I would do them. For example, it would suck if I picked up the 60 quilboar tusk quest but forgot to get Weapons of Choice quest because both quest are best when done together. So following something like Joana's(or any other) leveling guild are great at keeping you efficient. Back in my vanilla days, my 1st char was obviously played very inefficiently but I got better and better at it for each char that I leveled afterwards(I didn't use any guides back then)
---
So I have used a guild for my recent pserver experience and Beta just so I can be efficient and not have to repeat areas because I forgot a quest or didn't sequence quest properly. Using a guide feels more like me perfecting my leveling process like I did in vanilla with each character after the 1st, but way more refined than I would have ever done. Since I can never truly forget everything in vanilla and never have the new &amp; fresh perspective, following a guide to be efficient seems like the next best and most enjoyable thing I can do for leveling. But to each there own of course :)
---
Thanks its only been reposted twice a day for the last year
---
phahaha LOL. In UK unless its cocaine or class A, you will be fine. Even if Class A is shipped to you and you need to go to the post office, claim ignorance.
---
honestly... your negative focus appears to me a bit exaggerated. After all, like many other players, i'm hyped for the release of classic and with that past memories become more present. That's all. Hope you can still enjoy the rest of your day. Cheers!
---
Both mage and warlock have good aoe. That's not a good determining factor. The problem with mage is if he runs out of mana, he basically does nothing. The paladin and warrior will have minimal downtime, but a mage will constantly be drinking or burning through mana. This puts that character out of sync with the other two. Life tap and flash of light make that a non issue for the warlock. Also, we've tested both of those compositions on private servers and it was convincing enough for my friend to switch from mage to warlock even though he preferred mage if he was solo.
---
I'll still do stuff in BfA with my friends and family, but I'd imagine Classic will be something like 90-95% of my playtime.
---
Hunters get pretty boring standing there shooting to be honest. Lock, mage, rogue for fun class.
---
Traitor.
---
Eat tide pods, move on.
---
there is really nothing foolish, i have given reasons why its not, and i havent heard any reasons why it is
---
Literally the point of an alt, which again, op stated would be casual play so taking his time and exploring etc.
---
Getting to 60 quickly allows you to take advantage of niche markets and farming spots and help out other people. Then with down time you can play your alt and get the leveling experience.
---
Also in terms of rushing, its not like you can skip any content. If you do it right you see almost every zone. I think you only avoid the lvl 1-10 zones beside yours, and sithilis

That white room, with the white chair in the middle, is actually underneath the big hill on GM island. Sadly, it seems GM island has been recently removed from the map on the current PTR. A bit of a bummer but almost impossible to get to these days anyway.
---
It does look like Beaza worked for Blizzard, reading their comments drops the massive hint they worked for Blizzard on WoW.
---
Anyway, here's the list of edits Beaza did:
---

---
The weapon skill vs defence miss chance perfectly matches an 8% hit cap vs bosses:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Miss?oldid=356356
---
&gt; When a player or other mob attacks a mob, the change in miss chance is 0.2% per rating difference if that rating difference is 11 or more. If the rating difference is 10 or less then the change in miss chance is 0.1% per point.
---
For Difference D &gt;= 11: Miss% = 5 + D * 0.2
---
For Difference D &lt;= 10: Miss% = 5 + D * 0.1
---
D = 15, Miss% = 5 + 15 * 0.2 = 5 + 3 = 8
---
D = 10, Miss% = 5 + 10 * 0.1 = 5 + 1 = 6
---
D = 5, Miss% = 5 + 5 * 0.1 = 5 + 0.5 = 5.5
---
Which as you state lower down, is how some private servers currently do Miss%.
---
Not sure about Deviate, but male and female do have different hitbox sizes. Female is quite a bit smaller (but still bigger than all other races).
---
Yeah parry haste is 40%
---
Teenage me lost my mind. I would always queue up Duel of the Fates to play during this lol
---
I don't have an official answer, but I suspect that it won't. The Classic client is actually a modified 7.3.5 (Legion) client.
---
Why are you so Toxic?
---
Ya that was such a giant misstep it's ridiculous. I wonder if he ever apologized.
---
Ugh, you don't understand my point. If there is epic lore behind a questing area or rep grind, but the reward is not proportional to the importance of the lore, then that creates a discontinuity in the game which breaks my immersion. I'm not talking about min/maxing things so that the game is soulless... the game is SUPPOSED to have rewards proportional to the difficulty of the content, that's the basic structure of the game. And when a new expansion comes and undermines that *basic structure*, then that breaks my immersion.
---
I explore and do random stuff in vanilla all the time, I just don't want to do a long rep grind for absolutely not useful reward, that doesn't feel good to me.
---
As long as they kept it client-side, otherwise, I'd probably stop playing. The patch when transmog was added was also the patch I quit the game. It just turned wow into a fashion show I could no longer feel immersed in the world.
---
Leveling using only 25% of the zones means your next character you can pick different zones.
---
Sure beats something like Legion, where you level in the same 4 zones, then do your world quests in the same 4 zones, and then level alts in the same 4 zones just to do world quests on them in the same 4 zones.
---
What feedback? Did you reply to the wrong thread?
---
Sorry to leave you hangin with no answers haha. Yeah the shaman was on a separate account but my brother was quitting wow at the time so I took it over. As for deleting my old main (level 40 something gnome rogue) I literally just wanted him deleted from existence because I loved that shaman so much more than him lol. It made sense in my 12 year old brain at the time. Now that I think of it I would love to see what’s up with my old account or if it even exists/has characters on it.
---
if no one answers within the next 10 hours i can check
---
You changed "successful" streamer into "better player". Why? You can be a great entertainer but be shit in the game. 
---
As long as you make fun content and entertain your audience you remain successful.
---
We are around 5-10 of us who will be raiding straight up. No I am not sure if they are planning to go as hard as I will, but temporarily filling a raiding spot shouldn't be too difficult in the top guilds since they will lack full stack. Unless I am wrong.
---
Anyway, Guilded and MMO-C will have recruitment posts so I will take a look.
---
If something isn't working as intended and negatively affects the gameplay/player experience it probably should be fixed to be fair. 
---
It's one thing if it's a bad feature that happened to be in vanilla, it's another if its a bug that causes people to be unable to do what you as a developer want them to. Blizzard and virtually all of the playerbase would want the door to open and allow the group to complete the instance. 
---
I won't be raging if they don't fix it of course, but it's a strange thing to be actively supporting. It's a very annoying instance breaking bug.
---
the start of the test was hard, but the rest is still HYPE !
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Ljs87hN](https://imgur.com/a/Ljs87hN)
---
the WoD one was the funniest lol
---
This is what I'm hoping. I understand min/max may be necessary later on as content progresses, but hope to see some cool specs raiding early on.
---
From what I understand, it is running on the current engine, simulating Patch 1.12 with content progressively added to simulate the patch cycle in Vanilla.
---
So it should have multithreading compatibility.
---
i guess my focus on why mage over lock is because they wont really use summoning stone, but portals will pay off nicely. 
---
if they dont care about that then sure warlock is just as good
---
You don't need to worry about the guilds who utilize dual wield tanks because it's only real good guilds who do it. Not even trying to be rude but your worrying about people who know more about the game than you do. Like for starters it requires a very specific spec you don't dual wield tank using a dps fury build.. 
---
Also it's only used in guilds where dps can actually take advantage of the additional threat. The tank needs to use full dps/health consumes and be full world buffed so it's not a means of being lazy it's literally how you try hard to the max.
---
I played the stress test with two 14 year old zoomers this morning, odd but quite fun experience.
---
Classic is built on the Legion engine, so yes it should have modern optimization
---
Yeah we were in Collision Force when he got hand of rag. But originally I was in Cancer, then iLL aDVISED, then CF. We got our eye pretty late compared to the better guilds and it was after Aurora transfered off.
---
it's gonna be shit because everyone worth talking to will be busy playing the game and not posting on Reddit.
---
Good point.
---
Lots of Vanilla abilities would get minor bumps as you level.  At higher levels it's barely noticeable.
---
lol the horde will be crying when they can't get to raid with buff
---
why you care about pleb streamers who can't even play one of the simplest video games on the marekt I have no idea.
---
There are no good alliance NA streamers. All dogs
---
Alt.
---
Someone in the classic hunter discord with the beta said it was 3 seconds baseline and 2.73 with the quiver on.
---
I can appreciate this, but I also don't think anyone particularly enjoys getting camped.  I don't really consider getting camped as top tier pvp either. Not saying you should play one way or the other but I also don't see the big deal on someone bitching about getting camped, it sucks its annoying, it happens, I generally move on with my life.
---
I liked it story wise, game-play was tolerable but the game was still all MMO very little RPG 
---
but ill still remember it as the best recent xpack
---
Pvp trinkets dont remove freezing trap in vanilla. If someone gets trapped they are staying trapped unless someone else dispels it.
---
I've been finishing up some old games that I didn't have time to play when they came out. Just finished God of War and Spiderman on the Ps4... highly recommend both of those games! About to start Horizon Zero Dawn.
---
I believe he used achievements on mythic+ content since those are listed as a percentage of total population and was able to extrapolate from there.  Statistica.com estimates the current wow population at ~5 million which is not all that far off of a 2.25+2.25 estimate. 
---
The surest sign though that the numbers are abysmal is that Blizzard hasn't bragged about them in almost a decade.
---
It is worth noting though, that the statistica's estimate is actually a projection that predates BfA so couldn't take into account the fact that BFA is a raging dumpster fire.
---
no those sucked too.
---
Reddit sucks at memes.
---
if I see another GTA "oh shit here we go again"...
---
All previous options are good but if you are sett on playing dps you might want to look to mage all the QoL a mage gets is really good for any duo. If it wasn't a alt your friend is playing you might want to play warlock to make level 40 alot cheaper
---
Absolutely wrong - I have no interest in convincing you but I have to respond so others are not mislead. Druids currently generate significantly more threat than warriors in pre-raid BiS and can abuse a powerful farmable item to double their TPS basically at will. Druids survive the overtuned damage on Pservers just fine, and Classic damage for bosses and elites has so far been much lower than Pserver numbers. 
---
These values have no effect on how often warriors parry, so their parries are already factored in to their TPS on Pservers and they still lose to druids. On Classic they will generate less, and so will druids, but overall TPS will be even more important so the Druid threat advantage will make them far more valuable.
---
Just to represent another experience, I played on an RP-PvP server and I found it no different what-so-ever from a PvP server.  I never saw RP happening in the wild.  Occasionally you'd see some low level characters RP'ing in the low level areas/towns (Goldshire, for example), but those were generally tourists there for the gimmick.
---
Maybe there was a huge RP underground thriving on my server that I just never noticed -- but if it was that hidden and niche, then the RP server really wasn't that different from any other, was it?
---
Good point
---
Kit out my Twink.
---
But in all seriousness, probably start gearing for Dungeons/Raids.
---
Just a chest X-Ray!
---
They literally just confirmed the formula works correctly for mobs higher than the player *yesterday.*..
---
Literally it's been one day and you want to complain that RFC should be impossible for level 10s because of the hit formulas?  
---
The formulas that the classic devs have shown made mobs higher level than the player *much* harder than they are relatively on pservers I might add.
---
101 fh = 38 C something like that
---
You do have priority. Most people who have been invited played during vanilla.
---
The individual I replied to commented as a response. They're a guild, all aligned with the same purpose.
---
Wowww. So I just looked up the quote. Saw the video. That guy is really president of blizzard? What a fucking ass. Only edgelords tell other people what they want.
---
They will crash lol
---
There sure are a lot of people certain they'll down KT.
---
female undead are the best rogues in the game imo
---
Or stand still.. or hold a 2h weapon properly..or a shield..none of their armor fits and they constantly are looking to their sides
---
Damn, finding a bug in a beta test... who woulda thought
---
You forgot Blessing of Freedom on Paladins.
---
yeah keeping it client side would be a good compromise
---
Unfortunately I'm NA but thanks for the invite, I guess the guild research will be kinda organic and I will find something that suit my play style.
---
I don't work from home but hmmmm I might take a week off for the release XD
---
Imp cs the hunter and poly the pet before he pops BW. You cant use BW while the pet is sheeped, only before sheep to prevent it.
---
Makes sense. Except great players adapt to situations and figure out solutions, average players complain and find it game breaking.
---
I don't think so, apart from rare exceptions like the AQ mount, scarab Lord title, corrupted ashbringer, and maybe a few others I don't remember. But also, that would be years ago. It's cool and all if someone cleared MC back in vanilla, but the raids we have today (on mythic difficulty) are way harder. The complexity of fights and number of abilities to keep in mind far out number classic. If I'm grinding current content then I will care more about the guy wearing current mythic tier gear, not somebody in 5 year old stuff. Show me your dedication to now, not 5 years ago.
---
You're so edgy, man..
---
just google blue post on pve population vs pvp population. you will find it. I work too damn much to google for you
---
Lame. I still hope that they allow him to be kitable for at least a week in classic so people can have a chance to kite him to SW. I'm still the kind of person who would if they could.
---
Logged into my classic hunter and my rhok'delar only did like 5-10 dmg or some shit. Wtf is that garbage?
---
Is there any proof of this.  I just see it claimed yet I've never seen an actual comparison that shows private server mobs do twice the damage.
---
No one can tell you which class you'll enjoy the most. Can't you just read the class descriptions and pick based on flair/fantasy/playstyle? Why would you want someone else to make the decision for you? Why would you want someone else's opinion on your own choices.
---
Do note that in PvP you will be RNG based on spell crit = you will not always "win".
---
Fucking gnomer??? Bruh
---
30/0/21 is viable in most dungeons as a healer.  Many guilds would expect you to have mana tide in raids though.
---
He said why. It's immersion breaking. Why is it skin off your nose to go through the same gearing process as every other player on the server?
---
Do you feel that you, heh, 'earned' the right to be a special snowflake because you got a piece of loot on a different game 2 years ago?
---
when was this census? like 2 years ago about pserverS?
---
Good luck
---
Sharding = per zone, tiny shards, permanent
---
Layering = entire world, massive shards, temporary
---
That's the gist of it
---
Not necessarily. A lot of people treat betas as demos, which they aren’t. It’s called a beta test for a reason.
---
You had widescreen in 2006? Not bad ;o
---
That's true, that makes sense. I understand where you're coming from.
---
I'v seen somewhere that the devs have stated that they are open to making new content after naxx as long as the servers are thriving.
---
Honestly the personalities of the steamers match the way the factions are. Alliance is the care bear faction with the odd warrior. Horde is the Warrior faction with the odd care bear. The Horde has always been the aggressive faction. You can see it in WSG where the average Ally team has 7 on defense half the time. Meanwhile if the Horde get more then two defenders. We go ape shit and scream for more Offensive.
---
Nope, when Classic was announced and which server people would run on.
---
Yes that's more realistic but, apparently the retail classic will be easier. Not going for a world record, I am not good enough or more so, knowledgeable enough BUT one of the first ones on the server would be good. A pointless epeen achievement, I know...  
---
I think those who will go hard can easily do it in 4-6 days, maybe pushing to 8 if you power down due to "burnout" or dying.
---
weekly threads for this on wednesdays
---
I think early bag drop rates were buffed pretty late in vanilla. It's a shame since crafting linen bags for mats at the first town used to be a great way to level up your tailoring.
---
It's absurd how much easier this fight is with a mage.
---
Because Kiting Kazzak to stormwind would be hilarious due to the mayhem he caused back in vanilla. I'm also in favor of them recreating the corrupted blood incident.
---
I was a part of 4 guilds on pservers with different players. All wishing they had a decent pve server. so I would assume people are going to branch out and pve will rule like back in the day. No sweat
---
Only one side is saying we should change WoW Classic so they will be happier.
---
Get bent. We waited a long time for this game. Go play Clash Royale.
---
What I’m saying is it feels off by 1/3. And maybe that’s because I have 53ms and a non potato computer.. but I’m in the beta and having things like this happen feels wrong.
---
And to think that all of them are streamers. Crazy.
---
True, it's why the initial prep is important:
---
Rolled right class to go beyond the pact?
---
Executing every little path from 1-12 perfectly to get ahead.
---
Then you will be among the "leaders" of the pact when following the guide.
---
Didn't watch the video yet but look at these 3 screenshots from Vanilla : [https://imgur.com/a/ZGGXaAe](https://imgur.com/a/ZGGXaAe)
---
I was a skinner and an herb gatherer and I barely managed to afford my mount at lvl 40.
---
It's not gonna be easy guys !
---
Effectively, most of the tryhard premades will probably go allaince because allaince are better in group PvP because of Paladins. However, in single skirmishes/solo play, horde has better racials, so there might be a lot of casual pvpers who want an edge going horde. Honestly, there's not really any way to predict the server balance, but TLDR: More horde on PvP servers, but more tryhard pvpers on allaince. On PVE servers more alliance because of paladins in raiding
---
It's not a stupid question, we actually don't know yet. We hope.
---
Go with the meta, that will make it easier on you to get into PVE stuff even with mediocre gear. Don't think you will be raiding as a ret paladin or something.
---
Healers (Paladin, Priest, Shaman), or Mages are always in high demand and can get by on OK gear. If you pick a Hunter or a Rogue you will have to compete with a lot of other DPS.
---
Just like you can stone form while blinded, and Will Of The Forsaken while feared, it does break.  
---
Even though I think pet damage on private servers has been slightly overtuned, it's still very much in the hunters favor.
---
You can sort of abuse sharding like this on Retail as well. A streamer did it once and the shard crashed at around 3 full raids.
---
"Layering is totally fine guys. Don't worry. You're being overly dramatic"
---
There was no achievement system in vanilla WoW. It wasn't introduced until I think Wrath. 2010ish if memory serves. I don't think you'll miss it, though.
---
That said, maybe somebody will make an addon that has a checklist of milestones and achievements you can work through and complete. I think an explorer or loremaster addon could be fun, for example.
---
do the Female troll jump kick? or she stays on her toes?
---
Ah well. Still gonna be griefed by competing guilds.
---
wowhead classic is lacking in a lot of ways. try https://vanillawowdb.com/  it is more like the original thottbot and allakazham
---
it doesnt work
---
Sadly, it seems like they want to try to keep it secret which realm they are picking. Which means if we accidentally pick the same realm it's going to be terrible.
---
Every night elf surrounding you is named Elaria or Leonidas. You got gnomes. You got humans with quirky two syllable names straight out of fortnite. Do you want to be surrounded by.. that. Or by the commraderie of the horde. Easy choice.
---
Mate, the appropriate level to do RFC is 13, not 16. 16 is deadmines. 10 would mean that Taragaman is 6 levels above, so he's red. That's doable, especially if you kite like they clearly have been, judging by where they killed him.
---
Bad bot?
---
Why'd you have to go and get me irradiated?
---
I see the way you're glowing with an aura no paladin created
---
Runs like this go: Hunter pulled, lost the tank, so we wipe 'til we break, then go back to the bank to deposit all the
---
Grime-encrusted objects that'll take up space until we're raiding
---
It's actually relatively less important than it was on pservers, and the Orc racial was never really that effective in the first place.
---
But because the bosses have more dodge and more parry the weapon skill takes a smaller portion of each off the table.
---
However it will still be pretty big for glancing blows, though not quite a small effective since in pservers glancing blow reduction could be reduced to 0% and on classic it can only be reduced to 5%.
---
Are you talking days as in (4 days) Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs or 4 days played as in / played 96 hrs?
---
PS BIG difference between 4 days and 10 days. Spoiler: 6 days
---
As a person who plans on leveling a rogue, the sword quests from RFD and SM are unskippable.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99998% sure that Estamiel is not a bot.

Roll need if the item would be an immediate upgrade for the roll you are playing right now. E.g. you immediately equip it and  it would be an obvious upgrade for your role the rest of run.
---
Anything, else, you ask before you roll need, Or you make other arrangements before you join the group. 
---
99% of the time if you ask to roll need, no one has a problem with it.
---
I did 7 days on a hunter on LH this past winter, with with a fair bit of fucking around, a few several hour sessions of just grinding, some pvp, some dungeons, hit ST for my 50 quest trinket etc.
---
4 is a stretch, but 5-6 is easy for someone reasonably focused.
---
Not to mention, this time around we are going into it with  a SHITLOAD more information and over a decade of experience. I will not be surprised to see someone absolutely min maxing and breaking sub 4-day times.
---
Does it seem impossible? I'm sure people thought the same thing about 4d 20h 14 years ago.
---
Already been confirmed by blizzard as bug. Why are these stupid as shit posts getting like 500 upvotes? People just want to be doomsayers I guess
---
Yeah it's a big problem. Blizzard is relying on the population to plummet. If they overestimate the drop, then we can expect them to keep layering permanently. And that's likely their plan anyway, they just need a convincing excuse.
---
Launch week***
---
Let clownsuits be fashionable again.
---
No shit. Maybe some people are interested in how things are evolving?
---
In terms of having that "authentic" nostalgic experience, this is the right way. Infact, I would only use couple of addons like postal/bagnon (think Postal will be useless as Blizz is incorporating that function in?).
---
Similar situation, and honestly it will be impossible to play classic Wow like I did as a teenager.  Let’s not kid ourselves; 2-4 hours a day isn’t enough time to be a serious raider in classic Wow.  
---
I’m not going to completely abandon my relationship/family/job responsibilities for a game.  The wife would let me, but that doesn’t mean I’d do that to her.  So il probably just casually play for the nostalgia, and never even try for a raiding guild this time around.
---
Vanilla is the only reason why this game was great at some point. And it's the reason BC and WotLK had their success. All good you have in the game was desinged before BC has launched. BC is not that bad, because old content was still playable and enjoyable. But you know, 60-lvl content was totally removed from the game, because literally everyone went to Hellfire Peninsula at 58 lvl. The whole idea of expanding the game was badly designed from the beggining, in my opinion.
---
So much ego lol, assuming everyone wants to know what server they are on so they can play with the streamer.
---
I want to know which server they are on so I can AVOID playing with them.
---
Ye exactly. It wont change anything if its in for even 2 weeks.
---
Random ass night elf needs to kick rocks
---
I just stopped replying. Those people will be everywhere man
---
I was on my pally when looted a fire wand from the defias wizards in elwynn.  I gave it to the first caster I saw on the way to turn in a quest.  A short time later a rogue came up to me while I was killing murlocs, helped me kill one, then gave me a 2h axe of the bear - which was a huge upgrade from my white mace.  Aside from a few cranky folks in general chat, everyone has been super nice and the good vibes are real.
---
Gnomeregan was fun. Having sunken temple on the list is way worse. that place was just tedious and unrewarding
---
Yeah, it's pretty funny, but the problem is he heals every time he gets a kill, so he becomes literally unkillable and the only way to get him to leave is a GM despawning him, after like 30 minutes it just becomes not fun anymore
---
It does, and it sucks, and is a big reason many of us find retail unplayable. This whole layering thing has been a total shitshow for Blizz. At this point they should just go with the earlier plan which was to create multiple servers then merge them together as populations decreased. It's looking like the naysayers were right on this one.
---
okay, lets be real, Launch Month****
---
I just hope they're not underestimating how many people are actually going to play Classic. I feel like, at least at first, they were treating it as a side project.
---
I've had old guildies I haven't seen and who haven't played in over a decade contact me recently about coming back for it. (Btw if you haven't, sign up on Vanillafriends.com and pass the word. I think it's a great tool and it's how they found me. I don't have any affiliation with the site, I just think it was a great idea.)
---
bip bip
---
This is correct for retail classic. However on private server Alliance often dominate. Paladins are waaaay better then Shamans for group pvp and it normally tips the scales. Also the fact that Paladins are also waay better in pve and the best pve support class by a mile. Also means the Alliance gear score on servers is normally way higher. So the Horde are also often out geared. As Alliance raiding is EZ money compared with Horde.
---
You'd never see them because of layering though.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8
---
oddly similar to mine
---
you're all in for a surprise, or maybe I am, we'll see. PS I've been here since Vanilla so not a "Generation Z" of WoW...
---
We progressed through all content up until the 2nd boss in Naxx with arms warriors, ret paladins, boomkins etc. in our regular raid group. Vanilla raiding was made easy enough to be able to experiment and still manage it. With all the private server theorycrafting it has become so trivial, because everyone maxes out their gear, specs, rotations etc.
---
Likely. The two clients are not in lockstep but they'll keep both updated and sharing most of the code.
---
Talking about /played  
---
In which case, the amount of hours that some of us will put in initially, is basically the same thing.
---
How will you farm mats for a priest in that amount of time?
---
Yeah I was a warrior tank and wiped.
---
That video on repeat of course!
---
No, no one levels as healer in vanilla
---
It's always assumed you as a druid, shaman, or paladin will not just be rolling on heal gear
---
You get the heal gear and then some.
---
You do not need to justify why you need DPS gear to plebs who think you're gonna heal your way to 60. lol
---
Apples and oranges.. but since you made that comment you obviously aren't equipped enough to make simple destinctions..
---
Yikes these people actually exist haha
---
I played druid all through vanillia up to wotlk. I have to say they are one of the most fun classes to play. Not the best at anything but their wpvp is almost unmatched. And with a hunter who is also S tier wpvp you guys will be a fierce combo. 
---
You guys will have to care for rogues and stuns in general. That and hard dps switches. Druids want to heal consistently over long fights while kiting. If a mage rogue focus you and wait till you get heals up then do a hard switch to the hunter you will have to blow nature's swiftness possibly. Druids dont have a lot off cc so it's worth thinking about taking feral charge to stop hard dps or heals. 
---
Your goal should be to outlast, out position, and out run your opponents. It took me a long time to realize one of my best tools against mages and high dps combos is simply running out of range in travel form and separating teammates
---
How was it taken out of context?
---
The question asked to them was if there was any plans on adding servers from previous expansions as they were back then.
---
He clearly says no. If he truly meant what you said he was implying he would have stated that the tech required was not available at that time...he even iterated on the idea that we wont like classic because it did not have a LFG finder.
---
"Remember in BC when you had to spam chat LF tank? Now all you have to do is press a button, you dont remember that"
---
There's no way Esfand said anything like that...
---
Yea I’m also confused. The meme is too fresh for the likes of me.
---
I have a screenshot I can post when I get back to my PC. Around 100 people stood on the wall of the destroyed tower near Tarren Mill. I think they were all stood on top of Asmongold
---
I mean, him coming on stage in front of the world at Blizzcon and announcing Classic was pretty maximal eating his words.

You literally do???!?!?!? they've said that they give priority to older accounts? What is the point of this post???!?!?

Man, you are missing Pump It Up

The people who are playing horde are all rolling horde together, and most of them are long time PVPers and arena players. While some of the people playing alliance do PVP, they are more into the world and everything else than just straight PVP.  
---
The Beta streams are too small of a sample size to represent how live will be. Play the faction you want.
---
I loved ZF so. freaking. much.
---
I still don't get what was so bad about it. People act like it was this crazy difficult dungeon, but I never had issues completing it with any random groups.
---
Were you guys well known back in the day? For some reason I can't shake this feeling that I've heard about that guild.
---
Sorry but you wont hit 60 in 4 days. The best speed runners in the world might hit that mark, but i doubt you are in the small club.
---
Thats like phase 3 right?
---
I think most of it looks pretty good, TBC was really the weird one. You had ass-ugly pieces that just had giant purple crystals shoved in them or highly aesthetic pieces in a set or otherwise.
---
Definitely. Saw asmongold and how his 100 fans circumvented it by inviting people to groups.
---
what do you say guys? you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters!
---
We are all individuals!
---
Flying was fun for a while, but it really really killed the connection to the cities and the content for me.
---
I would like to see a refresh without flying or adding a "sprint" to ground mount.
---
hes missing nothing at all
---
I usually have 7-8 hours during work week. However, playing this, 5-6 will be plenty. We'll see.

They have three months to fix a technology they are pioneering. I'm definitely on team no layering but, it is happening. The fact we got layering over sharding was already a huge victory. The only thing you can do is report it and hope they fix it.
---
No, but they confirmed it is working in Beta for level 30. So should be in classic.
---
Good luck doing 1-6 at launch with literally hundreds of others at the same time.
---
On Dragonblight there were people joining BGs at level X1- X4, who ran to mid once, died, immediately gave up, and then spent the rest of the time sitting in the graveyard whining about how X faction is garbage. 
---
Those people suck.
---
So how was the lag?
---
Why do you keep saying less than 3% when we are clearly talking about mounted travel? It’s 3%, not less. 
---
Getting it is still *playing the game*, why should I not be having fun playing the game in order to get it? Your thinking is backwards. The act of getting it is not a chore or a waste of time, it’s literally part of the fun of playing the game. If you think having the trinket is just some tool to min max your levelling, then good for you - but don’t assume that doing the questing itself isn’t fun for me, because it is. Classic is not about instant gratification. 
---
Secondly, why would I not be planning my routes beforehand anyway?
---
You are trying to strawman my *opinion*. To me, having those extra couple of minutes is time that I can pick up the dog poop, have a quick shower, or make my lunch for tomorrow. To you that might be nothing, but it is *subjective* because to me it is nice to have that time available.
---
Tons of tauren use Noggen fogger and deviate delight to fix their hitbox.
---
However, Some hunters go tauren because it's nearly impossible to deadzone a tauren hunter.
---
Interesting. Yeah that does make that fight in the Hunter’s favour for sure.
---
Ooo thatd be cool
---
It was the best post WOTLK expac, doesn't mean it was loved x)
---
Pretty much that myself along with others haven't been gotten it. That's it. Hence the short rant part in the title.
---
Fun fact if your Undead. You can eat people after you kill them for maximum disrespect.
---
You're literally talking about clearing the catch-up raids and a then-year-plus-old tank-and-spank raid, and you didn't even clear BWL.
---
I actually agree that Vanilla mechanics were easy compared to the bullet hells of retail Mythic raids. But this is basically the equivalent of a retail player who's never even entered a Mythic raid saying, "All of retail raiding is easy, because my ten-mans can clear Uldir in 8.1.5, and we also get good clear times on Freehold and Tol Dagor!" You didn't even kill Nefarian or Prophet Skeram, let alone any of the legitimately hard bosses in AQ40 or Naxx. Why would you ever think you have the expertise to discuss the difficulty curves of Vanilla raiding if you never did any of the difficult Vanilla raid content?
---
I believe I was just doing a little ball busting.
---
His friend is an orc, so playing a paladin will not be possible.
---
I'm not sure this is a bug. I know that you used to be able to accomplish this by queueing into a BG, accepting the instance invite, then leaving the game. You'd drop wherever you were on the FP when you accepted the invite.
---
I guess what I should say is that this was a bug that persisted through TBC.
---
  /General. LFM Zul'Farrak need tank and heals, got mallet.  Hahahaha
---
It is clearly taken out of context if you think he literally meant "You think you want to play vanilla but you actually don't want to play vanilla.  I know better about what you want than what you do."  He meant the experience wont be what you expect.  Go ahead watch the video, he specifically mentions exploiting and problems around the [b.net](https://b.net) infrastructure.  You can take it out of context all you want but it is clear to me what he meant if you actually watch the whole thing.  He was also trying to play up the improvements to the game at the same time.  Not surprising he was trying to promote the game in its current state.
---
When I first played wow, I thought, everyone looks horrible, terrible mismatched armour, weak weapons.  I'd see people in raid gear, and think wow, they look amazing, and strong.  Now when I see groups in non-classic wow, every set looks like a high end raid set, and since I've started playing DnD, I've come to realize that this picture is full of adventurers.
---
Well yeah, beta invites are extremely limited.
---
You'll be able to play it in 89 days.
---
The people in this thread saying you would only roll on gear for your current role are literally lfg babies from WotLK. That druid could be any spec, and perform any role in the dungeon right up to lvl 60 dungeons. Just because he's healing doesn't mean he can't roll on agi gear. If he decides to tank the next run, now he cant roll on int leather? You people are so fucking stupid, I look forward to not having any of you in the dungeon groups I form.
---
&gt; No, no one levels as healer in vanilla 
---
Quite a few did, and quite a few will do it again.
---
They are actually quite viable, but not optimal.
---
We have different tastes for sure. Uldaman and BRD are my two least favorite dungeons in the entire game. Uldaman more for the dumb level difference between the start and end, but both due to being sick of the dark iron dwarves inside a volcano motif.
---
They still are for warriors of other races than orc and human, or if you're using a weapon other than your specialized one.
---
esfand/staysafe started bitching about horde players who started a raid to counter asmongold's farming a few days ago, and yesterday he was mad because he lost a gurubashi fight and got camped in stv, so yea i can see where OP is coming from
---
fair enough, lol
---
It's not hard to do. You take the client / server code, find the backup, put it up and your done. People create private servers for fun. In fact, it's easier since you can essentially remove content from future expansion with zero worry. Actual servers have long since been gone and will never come back. You can make the game feel empty or full at leisure with layering / sharding.
---
Sure, priest healer would work, but I guess they need a lot of farm at lvl 60?
---
I mean... current WoW isn't hard either. At least classic took dedication, and time. When I got something, like my epic mount, it felt like a real achievement. BfA has all these shiny items and grand achievements but they feel hollow.
---
I got exalted with all of the PVP reps, and the main factions in Classic and it felt like a real achievement.
---
Still do.
---
That's fine I'm just looking to play something a bit different in pvp, only thing turning me off the idea is worrying about gearing up :)
---
whoooooosh
---
If you start picking and choosing which features you use, you're going to pick features someone hates and leave out features someone loves.  
---
My opinion on the three expansions:
---
**Vanilla**
---
In my opinion, the overall worst of the three (but better than anything that came after them).  Vanilla was a great experience, but there were a whole lot of things that hadn't been figured out yet.  It's like a long-running show, where they hadn't quite yet nailed the personality of one of the leads, the mannerisms of the quirky character hadn't yet become canon, and there's a few characters that will be recast by Season 3.  It's amazing enough to get renewed for several seasons, but there are some growing pains here.  
---
The biggest issues in Vanilla, for me, are:
---
* The PvP system is unrewarding at low levels, especially in battlegrounds
---
* Some specializations really come into their own with changes in TBC (such as Prot Paladins being useful, or Resto Druids finding their niche)
---
* Some loot issues, such as level 20 gloves being pre-raid BiS, or dungeon bosses dropping white gear
---
However, Vanilla has one of the best leveling experiences of any MMO I've ever played, and it requires grouping far more than any other expansion.
---
**TBC**
---
I often think of Vanilla as the Beta for TBC.  The classes really started to find their footing in TBC, and it had the best class balance the game has ever had.  I loved the PVP changes and the addition of arenas.  In general I'm against dungeon difficulties, but the way it's done in TBC is just enough to not intrude on my immersion.
---
That's the thing about TBC.  A lot of the things it introduced (like flying mounts and badge gear) were not overdone in TBC.  They were done just right to add to the experience instead of take away from it.  I think the move to 10- and 25-man raids was a good one, and two of my top 3 raids come from TBC (Kara and ZA).
---
TBC was, in my opinion, the best expansion ever, because it took Vanilla and made it better in pretty much every way.
---
**WotLK**
---
Wrath has some of the best things in WoW, but also some of the worst.  Class balance got better for healers, but worse for everyone else, when they started trying to implement "bring the player, not the class".   They balanced purely around PvE, so classes that were already strong in PvP (like a Frost Mage) became godlike.
---
Dual spec was introduced, which killed the hybrid builds I love so much.  Death Knights came in, and were completely overpowered.  It had one of my least favorite battlegrounds (Isle of Conquest) and another that I'm not too fond of (Strand of the Ancients).  Trial of the Crusader, while an interesting idea, was also a horrible raid tier.
---
However, the leveling in Wrath is by far the best of any expansion.  In my opinion, almost as good as Vanilla.  There were multiple progressions to leveling, and once again flying is a feature that makes Storm Peaks and Icecrown unique experiences.  Ulduar is bar none the best raid this game has ever had.  The reason they abandoned Ulduar style hardmodes was frankly insulting to the player-base (and is when the game really started going downhill).  
---
Wrath gave us dual spec, but also gave us other features that would start to eat away at the game.  Variable raid sizes, while a good idea on paper, were not as good in practice, and Blizzard never really got it right.  You had 10-man only guilds, and you had 10-man and 25-man guilds that got double the gear, and the extra half was higher item level.  Normal and Heroic modes went through several iterations, and went from the organic masterpiece that was Ulduar to clicking "heroic" and getting harder numbers.  
---
Wrath had some of my favorite memories of WoW, but I don't think it was quite the masterpiece that TBC was.
---
What about the poor Dwarves and Gnomes?!
---
the best bit about classic being a roaring success is that it is a giant "Fuck you" to Activision's bland corporate style that Bliz is slavishly beholden to. They mocked and ridiculed us for wanting it, so we went away and built our own. They tried to shut them down, we built more.
---
They then turned around and said- we will make it. And even then, the retail slaves still pile shit on us for wanting it more than the loot-go-round that is retail.
---
I think in 2-3 years time classic will dominate retail and become the new norm.
---
And it will be because we said "fuck you" to Activision and their out of touch execs.
---
great, ty
---
I dont know where you heard that, but its completely wrong. Even Joana said it will take 30% longer to level in classic than on pservers.
---
Why is Vanilla missing pieces that BC has, but Classic isn’t missing the same pieces?
---
They should do a 1-15 or something just for a weekend before the full game release
---
What I got from this is vanilla is incomplete, TBC is complete, WotLk is scuffed, and classic is remastered TBC
---
What mats?
---
This is like The Battle of the Bastards, only more colorful and less bloody.
---
&gt; Hmm I could use the image (...)
---
&gt; That's not how layering actually works. 
---
??
---
Ehm, he actually didn't say anything about how "layering actually works"? :D
---
The 3 clips are from a stress test where Blizzard announced on the server they'll be playing and testing the layering in different ways and issues were to be expected.
---
hopefully retirement lol
---
Yes, maybe.
---
Shhh, don't tell that or the elitists will hunt you down irl ;)
---
I'd say a good tank/DPS, like either a pally or Druid....as you can DPS &amp; heal.
---
They also got lots of buffs and gear buffs later in vanilla well after most guilds had their primary roster locked in place. On private servers most of that was in from day 1.
---
Even better. Fth.

My God...they must have no lives at all.

A hope?
---
A chance.
---
I didn't like transmog when it came out.  I like it in its current iteration.  At this point, getting awesome looking gear isn't that hard to do.  Standing around in a city looking awesome is not the status symbol it is in Classic.  Since it is not a status symbol, it is not a problem that people look awesome.
---
Not sure if anyone mentioned this, but spamming jump while heading up these stairs was kind of stupidly funny
---
We are talking about saving time, which it is less than 3%. Even if we talking about mounted time, it is still less than 3% because of you walking in to smth or standing still.
---
Besides nice twisting of words. I only attacked your "big time difference", I never said you should change your play style or what you do.
---
All I said is that less than 3% is not a big time difference which is a fact not an opinion.
---
And just to let you know, not getting the carrot will give you more minutes to go out with the dog or do rl stuff because it saves you more time than getting the carrot.
---
I'm very interested in whether or not this is true. If you can link me the source for that info I'd really appreciate it.
---
Instead of being a tool on reddit, try using that little report bug button on your screen and move on with your life.
---
OP just wants others to be as miserable as they are.
---
In high school my record number of consecutive backflips on the ground was around 8 or 10.
---
I can barely do one without seeing stars anymore.
---
I remember getting one of our dps to help heal while I used ravager to just aoe all of them down. Was probably the most satisfying thing ever in game for me.
---
Its vanillas image with the missing parts fixed/filled in. And a portrait frame. :)
---
Not only is it endearing, but the fact there's only a few great sets means it's more rewarding when you finally manage to get *that* set!

Is this when the streamers crashed the server? Thanks asmongold.

Mark Kern is a huge piece of shit lol. He drove all of his post Blizzard business ventures in to the ground and spends most of his days now being a manchild on twitter. You are being mislead because he says what you want to hear. Fuck this guy.
---
Most definitely!
---
In retail I’d love a toggle switch to have transmog turned off or on from my characters point of view. 
---
Or a toggle between old and new models. The latter wouldn’t ever happen because of updated animation rigs, but I can dream.
---
you'd be able to heal any 5 man or part of a 10 man (for UBRS), as an ele/resto spec. Just get good +SP or +heal gear as you level.  
---
For raiding, again - MC would be pretty ok to still heal as Ele/resto, but your guild may ask you to respec...maybe not, if they are all good players and know their classes.
---
Remember Noss?

&gt;  a beta designed to ensure the product behaves like classic.
---
beta is not for that only. the main purpose of the beta is to find bugs.  it has nothing to do with vanilla WoW.
---
Living out my arms warrior fantasy with this game
---
That could potentially be explained by partial resists. Frost, fire, arcane, and nature all have resistance values but holy does not.
---
&gt;The issue with this is item level doesn't necessarily make an item better, stat allocation and effects matter a lot too. 
---
Ignoring jewelery and trinkets, all items have primary stat and primary stat increases drastically with each item level. So yes, item level does, in general, make an item better.

Shoutout to the episode that got me into WoW
---
I mean, I'm sure that's a bug associated with the influx of people. I don't think that's something that they are implementation in the game.
---
Because it made getting a full set or decent looking weapon all the more exciting/rewarding by comparison. 
---
That, and the absence of transmog allowed certain loot to essentially become status symbols, even if it didn't look that great. MC/BWL-geared warriors come to mind. They looked goofy as hell but if you saw those bright orange gauntlets and an Ash'kandi bearing down on you, you knew you were in for a world of hurt.
---
i honestly think bears are going to become the new meta for main tanks. we already have it confirmed that warriors can no longer abuse enrage for permanent 25% damage. additionally, warriors attack way faster than bear druids and naturally output way more attacks per minute so the 40% haste is going to have a LOT more uptime on the boss. tertiarily, this means all tanks will do about 9% less threat, but since druids already do so much more than warriors, this serves to be a much larger problem for a warrior than a bear as far as dps are concerned about how much theyll be restrained and how easy it will be to overthreat and pull
---
im so excited. ive been a fan since its dark days of being vastly bugged and broken on almost every private server and after all these years of raiding with the same people for well over half a decade now proving what i know bears can do, i was already given the green light to bear tank for the guild
---
im so fu- feraling excited lol.
---
Yea anything is viable to level dude...
---
What is your point?
---
Empty raid slots are viable in raids too. Low bar
---
Again it's assumed I'm rolling on DPS gear, if you' don't know that you're an idiot. The way you said healers are "viable" for leveling makes you sound like an idiot. Don't need to say anything.
---
Im with you. When i was younger, the two massive mmorpg everyone had heard of here in England was Runescape and WoW. Both games actually shared a similar fate, but Oldschool Runescape was released in 2013 and now is vastly more popular than the "retail" version [http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs\_tools/graph/](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/) source. And well, it's pretty easy to see the same thing happening again with WoW.
---
World Server is down.
---
Either way, they might have to add more content just to keep the player base from getting bored. *Braces for incoming wave of people screaming "no changes not now not ever"*  Look. All I'm saying is that the Classic team is different from the Retail team, and when Ion said that classic wasn't "their game to change" I believe he meant the retail team. The classic team has said they will consider new content if people ask for it. If they changed the core mechanics of the game, that would be one thing, and the game would no longer be WoW classic. That I agree with. However, new content that does not change the core mechanics of the game shouldn't be knocked off the table completely. While they should wait for the original classic content to be rolled out to add new stuff, and that maybe it should be polled (Similar to Old School RuneScape) if they never add new content to the game, it will die a slow painful death after people have done everything and essentially 100%ed the game. No. PvP cannot keep the game afloat. It will lead to the PvP community getting so good at it that new players can't get into PvP, which at that point would be the "endgame". Even if enough people still play an MMORPG for it to be profitable, it dies when the devs stop adding content, as it's going to slowly bleed out players as they get bored of the content and go to other games so they can experience something new.
---
The music is lovely too, the savanna music is the best there is
---
The light and atmosphere in the Wetlands always has made it one of my favorite areas. I had several characters with their hearthstone in Menethil, I was telling myself that it's because it's convenient but actually it's just that I liked it.
---
seems like this could be something that someone could test somehow. Like maybe in some kind of pre-release test perhaps? 
---
JK. capping honor, profs and working toward lvl 30 BIS items is way cooler
---
There's gonna be more than twice as many undead rogues as orcs. There will also be more than twice as many orc rogues as trolls.
---
Go troll. Super underrated rogue class, hardly anyone will play one, good racial if you use it well.
---
That's... Why it's funny.
---
TBC was hands down the best in terms of gameplay and mechanics.  It had the feel of vanilla but every class and spec had an actual identity and were useful in some way (except ret on Alliance).  The raiding was a lot more complicated and interesting, the PvP wasn't just a test of who can 1-shot fastest.
---
It definitely suffered from the whole "Outland invalidates Azeroth" problem, and had infamously wacky looks to some of it.  People criticize flying and dailies now, but at the time they were overwhelmingly well received.
---
Hunter is on average low on gear dependance, while Feral (bear) BiS or almost-BiS quite often are blue from quests/dungeons and PvP rep rewards. And druids are quite good at flag carrying etc.
---
I'm going female orc since the male doesn't suit rogue that much imo.
---
Goblin Sapper Charges.
---
Undead male...goes right for the berrys....nice
---
Well like it or not, he was tethered so he cannot be kited. 
---
Speaks volumes about the kinda player who just wants to "fuck" with people, and ruin their gaming experience. But thankfully Bliz has removed this loophole for players such as the OP!
---
Hahaha I never knew NE rogues were so looked down upon
---
"cLaSsIc wIlL bE dEaD iN tWo mOnThS!!!!"
---
Nope, it's absolutely what I'll be listening to.
---
Plenty of classes will take lower ilvl gear with better stats.
---
Female Orc looks pretty bad ass in almost all gear. Male Orc is too bulky for Rogue class fantasy, in my opinion.
---
But damn them mail / plate gear on my green bois lookin stronk.
---
you mean the one I use for work that gets full of dust when used to take pictures on jobsites, strains my eyes to read in the sunlight and i generally associate with stress. yes I've got a phone.
---
More like Gwen Stefani - What you waiting for
---
I thought most "blizz like" pservers were also doing itemization progression? Something that Blizzard isn't doing with classic so stuff like BRE will be BiS for almost all phases.
---
I didn't make the video, but I checked and it hasn't been shared here before. It might not work out if the proc rate is too low for either the Lawbringer set or the Hand of Edward the Odd, but it would be awesome if it did!

---
Saw you replyed to a simiøar question further down.

---
PoE is needlessly complicated.  Can't seem to get invested in that game no matter how many times I try it.  To each their own.
---
So all these people used raids to get on the same layer?
---
I really dont find this place toxic compared to many subs 
---
and im 31 and kinda grumpy lol
---
In Vanilla it could take 4 hours if no one knew the whole thing. Once I learned it yeah, no big deal, but as a noob it was rough.
---
From my experience with the beta, it runs so well doing standard stuff it's like running a Youtube video in chrome. I'm honestly surprised at how little resources the game uses.
---
You could likely play this game on a 4 year old laptop with integrated graphics without any problems.
---
Incidentally I remember using that LFG tool. Usually when I was running a dungeon with guildies and we just needed one more dps. 
---
Don’t think we ever used it for finding tanks.
---
Everyone talking about how they can only heal at 60 but no one mentions just how OP they are at it. 
---
They are the most mana efficient healers in the game bar none. You hardly use mana pots or runes or mp5 consumes and you don't even need to flask until maybe AQ40 proression
---
Bubble is a god damn cheat code. Literally a get out of jail free card you pop when you would otherwise be toast. Lets you completely cheese certain raid boss mechanics to a point where its hardly fair. 
---
Lay on hands is OP as shit too. Can be used when oom, heals a tank to full AND boosts their armor. A timely lay on hands can be the difference between downing Nef for the first time and wiping. 
---
Blessings are also stupid OP buffs. BoW gives more mana than mana tide totem which shamans are forced to spec 31 points in resto to get. Salvation is a game changer and makes threat almost a non issue for alliance. Kings is a 10% stats increase so nothing more even needs to be said. 
---
Also you can't tank progression but if you plan on raiding you can tank dungeons once you get T2.
---
Yes and there was no actual evidence that it was the case that private server dungeons were easier just some people who felt that way, and the fucking goalpost moves every time.
---
First, it was everything.   Then when people showed that classic non-elite mobs were comparable or on average harder, it moved to instances being harder and raids being harder.
---
Then they showed that that boss from deadmines is basically the same as he was on private servers.  Then it became non-instance, non-boss elites that were "twice" as hard on pservers, without any proof.
---
And fwiw tanking 6 mobs in SFK wasn't that hard for a decently geared tank.  The hard part was holding threat on 6 mobs when thunderclap was capped at 4 mobs.
---

\#NeverForget

I’ve seen a few videos of Brd farming in the mid 50’s, doesn’t seem too bad. Looks like a lot of gold too, I’m excited to try it myself
---
Either that or migrate to newly opened servers, which makes the whole idea of layering pointless.
---
PvE server...solved
---
thats fine but good luck killing 65,340,285 boars listening to that lol
---
😭😭😭😭😭
---
On retail, before I quit, I had a level 32 troll rogue camped on the outskirts of goldshire to sap, CC and otherwise mess with people who were chilling there. I was literally trolling people. Watching them get super paranoid and thinking there might be a high level rogue in the area was hilarious and one time I nearly kited a ~level 70 druid to death. For the record, I normally play alliance.
---
There's only so much optimization that can be done.  Things like travel time between quests, vendors, skill trainers, flights, boats/zeppelins, etc. are static factors into the overall time; there's nothing you can do to reduce these aside from change the path, but even these things that could previously be optimized are reaching their limits. Everyone now understands how best to do those aspects (optimal grinding/questing paths, combat efficiency, etc).  Joana had it fairly nailed down in Vanilla, but the leveling time's are asymptotic: improvement will be less and less and there is a theoretical point below which is impossible.
---
I'll be completely surprised if anyone get's below 4 days.
---
*And thus, the servers of Classic WoW have opened, and behold, the great immigration has started. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people left BfA, only to go back 15 years in time to relive the past. Rest thine eyes upon these people and ask yourself, “Was it worth it?”*
---
I haven't heard of this, do you mean solo or group farming those dungeons? Do you just farm trash, or clear bosses? What classes are able to do this?
---
You sounds like you’re describing your work schedule. “Boss says I gotta keep farming, something about niche markets. It’s tough, but at least I get to enjoy myself on my down time.”
---
I think more people need to think outside the box with Classic rather than just parrot the stuff from before.
---
im excited to see what happens with the resist formulas/1% universal resist. correct me if im wrong but wasnt there a statement that certain bosses will have omega levels of resists on certain schools of spells?
---
im not saying its going to make hybrid arcane mages or balance druids suddenly viable (which would be pretty hysterical if it somehow did to be honest) due to being able to avoid resists, but it will be exciting to hear about
---
/r/barrenschat
---
Yea it would be great if you can solofarm dungeons from 48 to 55 and then get to 60 by questing and killing valuable mobs in silithus. Easy epic mount by 60 while others wasted time on catching up with herbalism and mining while leveling.
---
Love solofarming dungeons too

Oof, point taken.

Cosmetics, side-grades, and possibly resistance gear that looks good (personal gripe, don't mind that last one) are probably the way to go loot-table wise. So long as the new BiS don't push core stats up it shouldn't fuck PvP too hard.

blizzard would literally have to remove spell batching in order for this to not function in Classic

---
My friend and I are currently going Warrior + Priest, and he is constantly wishing we had a mage.  He will gather up like 15 mobs at a time, and slowly whittle them down with shield spikes.  A mage with Blizzard would be a huge boon to us.  
---
Warrior - Mage - Healer is probably one of the best, if not the best, leveling trios you could have.
---
He's saying that in retail since like WotLK everyone is just handed high-end gear for little to no effort, or you could solo old raids to get good-looking pieces so it's not even like someone had to put effort into looking badass like in TBC if they had some cool T6 helm for example.
---
After that I'm not sure, but I think he's implying if they added transmog later down the road in vanilla people would be like in AQ40 gear but transmog some T0 or blue pvp set they got that they like the looks of but they still had to put effort into getting all that gear so people woulnd't mind it as much in that instance in his opinion.
---
1.12 means you usually have 4 bags at lv 8
---
Heirlooms aren't that bad.
---
Experienced players who can't be bothered leveling to 120 through the same content over and over again can get these boosts, while new players can't afford them and they engulf themselves in the quest rewards.
---
source; myself, started playing quite recently so lvl'd without heirlooms. Then wanted an alt, and another, and another and heirlooms was nice. The main content for me is the end-game content, so leveling through same storylines got boring :)
---
&lt;3 love it. Wanna do it again!
---
Let the executions BEGIN!
---
Yes, that's why the parry talents are in the arms tree for warriors and the ret tree for paladins.
---
Well, mostly I "know", but that's more like my highly personalized opinion that wouldn't bring any discussion forward.
---
I'm trying to distill that into a set of principles.
---
And I admit that so far it is flawed and still leaves much to interpretation, as in my example about class balance. But as much as that is a flaw, it is also a merit, because it is a good starting ground to build into a full ruleset depending on what one actually wants to describe.
---
As far as i know its mage only. You can solo a lot of trash, make good xp and an insane amount of gold. The run is around 10minutes so the 1 hour lockout won‘t be a problem.
---
https://youtu.be/yj_c7R2MW6s
---
I would suggest hunter for you, Right now I'm stuck between a shadow priest or warlock :(
---
It's not the difficulty, it's the getting lost.
---
People don't like layering because it's a concept that shits bricks on the thing that made vanilla - the community.
---
Should the warrior roll?  Probably not.  Its not worth getting black listed by at minimum the druid you rolled against.  The maximum consequence is that Druid is in a guild that shares black lists.  Its hard to get off one once you are there.  Be kind to your classic bros.
---
and flying mounts
---
The problems lie in the 16 debuff limit judgement of light wont stay in target.
---
However i feel in classic paladins might actually melee more in raids while topping healing.
---
Also his build is bad. Particularly all the prot stuff is wrong
---
Yes, I hate the clown mount parade of the factions now. Can't tell which faction is which by looking all the crazy mounts. There is no uniformity. 
---
In classic it'll be Horses, Rams, Nightsabers and Mechanostriders vs Wolves, Raptors, Kodos, and Undead Horses mainly. And it'll be glorious
---
No offence but I simply can’t see how what he says can be taken as anything besides patronising and in a “I know best” kind of tone. He explicitly says that people don’t miss making groups and going to dungeons because we have LFR, as if LFR is the best thing that’s ever happened. I appreciate what he says about the bugs and how they’ve improved the experience but his tone and attitude is awful and he should never speak to a customer like that
---
Indeed, damn.
---
I leveled 13 (yes, I have issues) character to level 10 on the beta, usually ending up with 2 additional bags at level 10 (besides the ones I bought at the vendor). So its not that bad, there are still low level tailors in towns offering bag services.
---
I know the older WoW audience thinks Wrath is worse than TBC and/or Vanilla but I never understood why. I started very late TBC so WotLK was my first whole expansion I got to experience so I might see it in a whole different light.
---
One of the most intense moments!!!! That fight would get pretty hectic I miss vanilla sooo much
---
TBC was amazing. I know flying mounts get hate but they were so cool when they first came out, the BGs and arena were fun. The tier sets looked cool. Farming for mounts and armor was a blast. The zones were all really good. Classic was great but TBC will always have a place in my heart. Disclaimer: I never had a level 60 in vanilla so it’ll be interesting to see what my rankings will be once I get a 60 in classic.
---
I had a lot of fun in vanilla RP-PVP twinking an UD rogue and hanging out at Raven Hill.  That was literally my RP, being a boogeyman.
---
It's hard to see on some devices, but the missing pieces have been half-assed into the picture in Paint.
---
we still don't know yet if Seal Twisting works or not - feel free to join our discord here with the rest of the Paladin theory crafters and I

---
Wrath had better class combat mechanics design. Everything else, aside from art, was better in BC. 
---
The BC endgame was better than vanilla, only trumped—imo by the pre honor days of classic. 
---
Vanilla had the best leveling, and grand rpg sense of scale. By Bc our geared 60s blasting through outlands kind of began to erode that suspension of disbelief. Everyone was data mining and everyone had to aim of getting to raiding ASAP. It was just a different mentality in 2004 when people started to hit cap.
---
These classic servers will be closer to the task oriented...ness approach from players, it’s just how most people play games now.
---
Legion PVP was total garbage and everybody knows that.
---
I was hoping to play on a 6 year-old laptop (2013 RMBP) with integrated graphics. 
---
\- looking to upgrade soon to a MBP with more cores and hoping it would improve the game. new macbooks support external GPUs so the bigger limitation is the CPU
---
He's not complaining, he just sounds incredulous. There's nothing wrong with expressing disbelief and it is extremely positive to have people bringing up questions and raising things to be tested.
---
I work in game dev, apparently this may surprise you but the attitude of skepticism and proving things is pervasive/necessary. In contrast, this attitude I've been seeing on forums recently where people are shunned for wanting things tested would't survive 10 minutes at a game studio or publisher. Being investigative is how problems get solved and bugs get quashed. it's not about being right or wrong, it's not about complaining, it's not about ego. It's 100% about making the product better.
---
I guarantee you that Blizzard appreciates all of the feedback they are getting from players and having new things to test regarding Classic. That's not only good game development, that's simple empiricism and good science.
---
That 13.4 FPS, so good. I remember those days.
---
According to a lot of people in the beta it runs buttery smooth.
---
I was alliance on eonar from launch and never once saw more than 5 people in dm, but if you guys remember it I guess
---
Sunken temple was amazing.
---
Flying mounts beg to differ on TBC part, and that's why I don't like this image.
---
It's the plan, I know 4 days is a push however.
---
&gt; Planning to do it within 4-8 days
---
Ah but thats just the thing, i believe you are not seeing it because you do not wish to see it - biases at work, hindering you from seeing the other side of the coin. I certainly see yours, I've even made use of the race change service on retail for pvp purposes, but i sincerely hope i never will in classic - and not just because it wasn't present back then.
---
Of course not. I killed more mobs in general, which yielded more XP, more coin, more junk to sell. Did you read my post? I said by the time we got to Brill, not by the time I finished my first quest. I used the Rattlecage Warlock quest to demonstrate how RNG can affect quest loot collection which, in turn, affects total junk loot obtained, money and XP.
---
How does this stuff go over your head? This is the simplest shit to understand. Kill more shit, get more shit.
---
It's why folks have toons just to AOE Farm.
---
&gt; which could make hunter's FD ability relevant again in raiding.
---
It's always been relevant for trinket swaps
---
Well, Order of the Slafing Ruby doesn't make much more sense.
---
Hopefully not but for the past few years, I've been getting bored quickly with games.
---
No it's not
---
I totally missed that when I first read it. Which is why I gave both as options
---
So playing a human w/ swords = dont need these anymore?  Interesting.
---
Instead of trying to find a class that guilds want, play the class you want and find a guild that you want.
---
Not all guilds raid the same way.
---
What you want is a bigger guild, they may not be first in raid content, but they will likely have 2 or more "raid teams", the primary team will be pushing the envelope the secondary teams will be training the underdogs on the farm raids, getting everyone geared out.
---
Just being consistant, Show up when you say you will, Come prepared. If you need buff potions, or food to perform,  prepare before the raid, so that you are at the dungeon and ready to help warlock summon the "special snowflakes" that are too busy to walk.   Watch the videos, so you know the fights. Know your role in the raid. If your  class has multiple ways it can help a raid on a certain boss, Know all of them and get clarification on which one your expected to perform.  Outside of raids, when your guild mates need help with something that you can help with, help them.
---
Just these basics will bring a lot to a raid/guild that doesn't show up on the dps, hps, and threat meters, but raid leaders notice that stuff, and remember it.
---
Did it never bug out and just spawn infinite waves and never stop for anyone else? That happened to my groups way more than the goblin not opening the door.
---
As far as I am concerned if you don't like being ganked roll on a PvE server. The threat of getting screwed over is what makes a PvP server. I hate how even after all of these years people still bitch and moan.
---
I think vanilla was more about persistence and effort than "skill" at least on the pve end of things 
---
and thats the way I prefer it, I dont have my teenage reaction time anymore
---
idk what your beef is. still not explaining your reasoning
---
i actually enjoy farming and am excited to farm tyr's hand for example, or being able to do many a BRD run. I also want to get engineering up quickly and get in some wpvp before all the pvpers outpace me cuz im a raider at heart
---
Yeah like you only clear a little bit of it
---
EDIT: meant to reply to guy below
---
Nice, my guild barely got passed Twin Emps.
---
That's true. The guy is probably fine
---
It runs on my 9 year old laptop fine (it does have dedicated graphics tho). I could probably crank up the settings too if not for the overheating lol.
---
server technical limitations at the time =/= a bug
---
that's why they are specifically bringing back spell batching
---
Well, Orgrimmar was okay this morning (8-9 CDT) when I was running around trying to find trainers and the bank. I can't believe I missed the bank straight in front of the gate! In my defense, I was looking for it in the modern location, on the other side of the valley from the auction house, and assumed that big building straight in front of the gate was the warchief's hold, like in retail.
---
I rather like Old Orgrimmar. It's timber and stone instead of stone and huge metal slabs, and the resolution isn't that horrid. Razor Hill looks almost the same (I think the ramp up to the lookout tower moved). 
---
Also, WTF are all the flightmasters?  So far I've only found ONE in Orgrimmar proper. Where are the zeppelins? Where are all the cheap bags I'm going to need to carry all the extra tools and reagents and stuff needed in Classic?
---
I like his lack of reply lmao
---
what video is this meme from dont know it
---
Not wow classic man
---
as i said earlier, the only way they can "fix" this is to remove spell batching completely so gg
---
millions of players played wow in 2004, not all of them can get in a small beta that has two servers, you're just one of millions.
---
Most likely, but I don't have as much time for gaming as I did when I was younger. If I do, great, at least I did what I wanted when I wanted it. I am not here for the long run. I know most of my IRLs will stop within 6 months and play very rarely. 
---
For the past 6 months I probably put in 24 hours of gaming in total... That's nothing.
---
Atm dx12 isnt enabled - so we need to w8 later builds. But i remember some interview where they stated they moved on from 7.3.5 client to 8.0 but nothing specific.
---
But yeah why bother with dx12 when you can tryhard r14
---
But i have not seen any videos from retail vanilla. Maybe this is something thats only possible on private servers, or people back then just didnt know about it.
---
Good, these are people we need. Blizzard gains nothing from you shaming other players producing potential action items to be tested, they gain a tremendous amount by having people's input, questions, and bug submissions. That is literally the point of a closed public beta.
---
All a good Frost mage has to do, is play in a Hunter's deadzone and otherwise find ways to waste BW's timer(ice block, 10s, is a great one). Like I said, a GOOD frost mage can and will do this. 18 seconds is a long time, and a 3 second stun sucks(they can use a trinket for that too), but I've seen them mitigate and overcome that. BM is also a strong burst, but very lazy tree otherwise. Once your main cooldown is gone, you're defenseless in PvP, albeit your Ranged is probably still just as strong as a Survival build. It otherwise makes you worse against classes that can otherwise "wait out" or "elude" you during that timer.
---
Wow til, that’s insane. Thank you
---
People need to stray from what pserver kids are saying about builds and play what they want, there are so many viable builds but if everyone thinks like pservers, no one will have fun finding something new.
---
If you can do Teremus I wouldn’t write Kazzak off so quickly. We won’t actually know until someone tries it.
---
You were told sharding was put in to make the world seem more alive because of low pops. The real reason is that it saved money so that server hardware can be assigned depending on load. There is nothing worse than doing quests and everything around you is phasing in and out non-stop - which is what has happened for years now. 
---
I'm not confused at all by "layering". The way you describe it has zero to do with how server hardware / code works now.  I guarantee there will be hundreds of layers at start, and it will continue as it's built into the server code. Blizzard will limit how you can manipulate it so you can't farm.
---
I think you also over estimate how much effort Blizzard has put into WoW Classic. Probably far more meetings on what they have to keep from Retail due to software / hardware issues, but honestly it gets easier as you progress through expansions (ie... Cataclysm and beyond would have very little code change).
---
It's possible, depending on how everything else shakes out. They will still be very good in the absence of any other +skill gear, just not necessarily better than more crit and AP.
---
Cool, shit on it when it's working as intended instead of picking apart functions that aren't even supposed to be there.
---
Yeah I figure the JoL probably won't be accepted in most raids, but if the proc rates are high enough for Lawbringer or Edward's Hand then having a Lawbringer Pally in the tank group might be a valid consideration.
---
They did they just weren’t making videos. (No YouTube really in 04)
---
Every gym subscription ever :( jk mine
---
It's ok guys layering will be fine
---
LAYERING WAS SUCH A STUPID FUCKING IDEA, LET BLIZZARD KNOW WHAT A STUPID MOVE THIS IS.
---
The idiot who approved that needs to be fired, immediately.
---
Ion
---
For Northshire Abbey that's normal: you can't learn skinning until level 5, and those were sub-level 5 mobs. As I recall, in retail, none of the "baby" 1-5 starter area mobs are skinnable: not Valley of Trials, not Echo Isles, not Northshire Abbey, or any of the rest.
---
My main discovering the alliance testing arcane nukes for the first time. Later known The Menethil Project
---
I've always disliked this picture because MoP and Legion are both great expansions.
---
weapon skill racials dont really matter for tanking warriors. the skill gives a tiny bit of hit/crit and reduces glancing blows
---
you eventually get hit capped anyway as a tanking warrior, the crit ends up being a TINY overall gain, and the glancing blows dont matter since your heroic strikes cannot glance
---
night elfs/dwarves have always been superior for tanking and this is nothing new
---
They were doing that to all get in the same layer.
---
Go on a private server and try some out. Nobody can tell you what you’re going to like.
---
For me personally it was the worst expansion they ever made at that point, even WoD was so much more enjoyable.
---
Sort of off-topic but related to the picture, there's a clear indication of the ponytail hairstyle being the #1 choice for female characters, and the shoulder-length hairstyle for the male characters as well. In almost any mmo or online game with customization, you can see this exact trend. GTA 5 Online for example; 99% of the female characters there don the ponytail, as well as in Fallout 76.
---
This is actually a complex issue. Is it because this specific hairstyle simply looks the best and fits the game/lore? Or is it because all the other hairstyles are just bad and don't work? I think it's a mixture of both, but the latter is the bigger reason overall.
---
Hair is very difficult to do in games, it is one of the most randomly behaving physical objects on our bodies which has a specific 'flow' factor to it. Not only do you need a shitload of miniscule polygons to make it look somewhat decent, but you also need to add some form of physics to it to make it look natural and not too uncanny. In games like WoW, the slight bobbing of the ponytail is just enough to make it not stand out too much. It has some form of movement, which is good. But the rest of the hairstyles are completely static and immediately look weird.
---
And to add onto this, it is why very long hair is almost never implemented in games. It takes too much processing power, too much scripting and a lot of fine tuning the clipping with the character's body and clothing/armor/weapons.
---
Just some food for thought and a random observation.
---
I am still horrified by what they did to it.  It's basically 2 rooms.
---
don't think BRD farming will work cause of the mobs having nets?
---
It was you that stole the very first name I wanted when I first started this game at 12 years old! That’s not a very drizzt like thing to do. W/e, I’ll name myself Artemis and find you. Or should I go with matronmalice and come give you a spanking for taking my god damn name!!!!
---
(Original post was removed for saying the name of a pserver)
---
Yes actually. There were a lot of bugs with quests on most vanilla servers that were giving increased experience values that were backported from TBC prepatch which were nearly double that of Vanilla. When it was proven, all those &lt;4 day level "records" were discounted.  Some people questioned it for years and most people disagreed before someone provided proof and they were changed in 2018.

---
Yeah. Raid groups were inviting everyone from World channel
---
I pooped myself with a slew of emotions
---
Yeah. There was a post earlier today showing vanilla/classic raid bosses have 14% parry, and pservers were running at 5%. That means raid bosses will parry more and attack faster.
---
That's one way that we know of that tanking will be more difficult in classic vs pservers. A few things like that would explain why vanilla Naxx tanks didn't "discover" the non-prot tanking meta.
---
Teremus wasnt tethered, Kazzak was.  We used to kite Teremus and Volchan to SW all the time in vanilla
---
imagine letting a streamer think for you
---
Me reading reddit while pooping
---
How much did 30 spellpower cost?
---
The gold is pretty shit tbh.
---
My greatest wish for classic is that they add all the planned content they never had time for. 
---
Open the Dragon isles, the area east on menethil that became twilight highlands, classic take on Gilneas, mount hyjal and all the little things they never had time or man power to implement.
---
No they arnt. Those are people who cant be assed to pay attention and read the forums that everything is working as intended
---
Those mobs are a little farther in, you only farm the next little bit. Videos of it on YouTube if you search
---
Imagine *wanting* to not be able to play for several days after launch because of how crowded the zone is. Even with 200+ people it was literally impossible to quest.
---
I haven't been in there in a decade or more, what did they do?
---
Can't wait for those Westfall jams.
---
Charging through the nose? You mean the exact same price it was 15 years ago? Lmao
---
That could explain the damage values on hitting mobs being higher, but I'm seeing the actual tooldip damage numbers go up with each level.
---
I was asking a question why rush to 60 when you can enjoy the game as you go, simple question for a simple answer
---
Carrot on a Stick and Loofah were everybody's first 2 trinkets
---
I think pathing your character, pulling mobs, speediness and efficiency of kills, reaction times for accepting/completing quests probably add up to a big portion of time over the span of 59 levels.
---
*#science*
---
Or at all.
---
Hmmm, this thing didn't work the first time, guess I give up now.
---
Strike 1! Alright, I'll quit baseball now.
---
Where does this puzzle piece go? Doesn't matter, time to quit.
---
And people asking for it needs a safe space.
---
But is it that game breaking? It maybe happens 1 in 30 runs at most.  It's annoying as fuck yes but if we want a true classic experience that's part of it. 
---
I stand by it's a slippery slope. It's annoying, a lot for classic is but it isn't game breaking.

If the looks alone hadn't already sold me long ago, Cannibalize definitely would have. It's so satisfying

All the league mechanics add up over the years yeah. But the game itself is easy to learn imo. LOTS of good guides and youtubers/streamers out there. Takes quite some time to learn tho. But once you do its a blast.

He's just misinformed.

I think this is simply a miscommunication from players and, people expressing their feelings poorly. It's not that classic wow is "hard" and, retail is "easy". At it's highest levels retail is far more difficult. It's that every piece of classic demands you slow down pay attention and, take it seriously. Now if you do that you may win most of the time but, you do have to do that.

In retail for 90%+ of the game. You can shut your brain off and just monkey forward alone. You can ape through, Leveling, Dungeons, Farming, and LFR. To say they are easy is an understatement. You actually have to try to die most of the time. The fact that heroic raids are hard is meaningless for most people because most people won't make it there. For 99% of people who play retail. Classic wow will be harder. The one % who do Heroic keys. Will think it's easy though.
---
To me people saying retail is harder. Are a lot like people saying a book series is good you just have to get through the first 5 books. Sorry fam you lost me when the first one was shit. When 99% of your game is a joke. I don't care that it has some difficult end cap.
---
What? Your response makes zero sense. They use beta to adjust their game and iron out issues and bugs. It’s the communities hope they’ll listen to the community and not push layering beyond the first month and only use it for launch. To get downvoted for saying “it’s a beta for a reason” is actually insane and proves how toxic this subreddit has gotten.
---
im hoping that due to the player base being wiser and inputs being quicker over internet itll be much more lax with raid comp, and maybe allow ret paladins, whom i think would be the better person to supply these benefits. if they can stay mid pack dps, and supply a constant stream of heals and buffs that would be perfect
---
or the stigma can continue and people reject non holy paladins outright
---
Some bosses/mobs are directly immune to certain types of damage and lots have higher than normal resists. Theres a bestiary (book) from 2.3 where a lot of that is revealed too. Many of them are known but for sure blizzard has 100% accurate data which is much more than what pservers have had available.
---
This time around I'm going to get all the attunements! I was dicking around with Iraq from 2005-2007 so I missed a large portion of wow considering I started playing in jan of 2005.
---
Came here to say this.  Some people just belong on PvE servers.
---
the world smells different for them
---
What does bis means?
---
Exactly... i dont know how the above poster seem so offended... and i missed the part that they confirmed about the hit formula.. i didnt read it. Chil out and peace!
---
It's not a matter of wanting to get into the beta.  The motivator behind your post is that you want to get in *instead* of someone else.  So don't say "Don't put one side down" when the whole point of your post is to disparage people for when they began playing a video game
---
Makes sense, thanks for clarification.
---
It does. If you're a government contractor (all hail the evil military-industrial complex! ;-) *and are doing a good job*, work slows down because you've almost completed all the tasks for the fiscal year that ends Sept 30.  Also half your government contacts are taking vacations, though it's not so bad as in December.
---
Of course, if you are doing a bad job, or your managers are incompetent and can't handle basic scheduling, you're scrambling to get everything done by Sept 30.
---
Whack a mole is raid healing in general.
---
It's not as if the concept of using a fast weapon for tanking originated on private servers. This was a common tactic for raiders in vanilla. Any tank worth their salt knew to use a fast weapon for tanking in high rage situations so you could spam heroic strike. I used to use Eskhander's Right Claw for this. If I had had a better dagger, I would have used it instead.
---
It always was, and probably will continue to be, about knowing when to use what items. 
---
Ahead on threat by a mile: pull out your defensive weapon.
---
Dps hot on your tail: maximize threat generation.
---
What I did see in private server raiding that was new to me was tanks using a couple of non-plate items for maximizing threat, like Aged Core Leather Gloves and Wristguards of True Flight. Given that we are likely to see bosses in classic with less armor than on private servers, I think tanks will need to continue this to keep up with fury warriors. There may be a few more fights where you won't be able to because of incoming damage, but when tanks aren't holding back the dps, fights can get pretty short.
---
I have a pretty beefy rig but [here's](https://i.imgur.com/hcROyqg.png) what I'm looking at. Game is frame capped at 120 in the middle of IF. All of my setting are maxed as can be.
---
Edit* another pic with me sitting out in [Dun Morogh](https://i.imgur.com/4XlAFW0.png)
---
I'm really going to miss not having transmog and flying in Classic. Will someone please change my mind? I want to be excited for not having these features haha
---
Haha that's probably true yeah. I'm sure all the deathknights were happy during WotLK.
---
Arena was great compared to Vanilla PvP i.e. the honor system grind/mafia. The gameplay generally was more balanced as well, compared to vanilla PvE mages that two-shot anything, raid geared rogues/warriors dominating etc. Gear balancing was much better with accessible PvP stuff being mostly the best but some PvE things desirable, vs. Vanilla where raid gear was almost always optimal. Far more interesting specs and options as well. Worst thing you can say is that it was mostly instanced. 
---
Daily quests were a vast improvement on repetitively killing mobs for rep. 
---
Achievements were completely groundbreaking and now adopted by every game ever.
---
&gt; "Welfare Epics"
---
These were released in vanilla with epic BG rep rewards, the tier 0.5 set, ZG/AQ in general etc 
---
You complain about TBC mace stun but just wait until half the warriors start running around with The Unstoppable Force as a welfare epic rep reward.
---
Yeah man, flameguard gauntlets.
---
I was rly against mog when it came out for all these reasons. But by now in retail there are *so many* aesthetic options that it’s just too cool of a feature to remove. But in vanilla you have so few options in the first place that adding it doesn’t seem worth trading what you lose.
---
Nobody knows exactly. Blizzard should have explained every detail in a blue post, they failed to do this. I fear layering is going to be fucking awful and many people will be turned off by it.
---
For me I'll probably mindlessly grind certain factions for some rewards while watching Netflix. Dual monitors and streaming services are going to be glorious for that stuff.
---
Probably. The beta is a patch or two behind BfA but it should catch up
---
Are you referring to his remark about how the bugs that were in classic would still be there today? Because I watched the video and that is the only other part of the answer that sort of goes into what you mentioned. I guess if you really digged into it this could imply that at the time they envisioned a classic server running off the old client and it would have all of its bugs and exploits.
---
It still doesnt dispute the fact that he has a really smarmy attitude about it with him implying that liking the game how it was is all in our heads and you are wrong for liking it that way because the game is so much better due to all of the QoL features.
---
+1
---
Ah I see. So you’re so wise and have the answers, of course its _we_ who don’t want to see it, by it, the truth. Which you know. Because you’re so wise. Gotchya.
---
Will you go double gathering at  launch for gold purposes or to head start on mining mats for engineering?
---
People are so obsessed with calling something "hard" or not "hard." Yeah it doesn't require genius or creativity but it is hard...You can die often, you have to know where you're going, there are hugely suboptimal places to be as far as XP/min go, you need to manage your resources, know what to avoid. When people say something is hard it doesn't have to mean that it requires raw skill but it's fine to say it about something that has a huge variance in how quickly and cleanly it can be done.
---
They weren’t until the truth was exposed by OP here.
---
Better than questing and pretty good xp, after you can start with BRD which is huge
---
asmon is most certainly going pve, his ego can’t handle losing against a ganker.
---
Personally I always max out my professions first, which are usually centred around money-making (like herbalism/alchemy). Then I start farming dungeons and gold in between, to buy gear. Then I focus on my mount once I have the AH gear I need. Prefer to have my pre-raid gear first
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9waYZef.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9waYZef.jpg)
---
How is that being misinformed?
---
So satisfying and so underrated for leveling and grinding. If I was playing a rogue or mage would be undead for sure. The min maxxer in me is just way too strong to not be an Orc Warrior and Warlock. Though I'll say Orc&gt;Undead for warriors anyway. My spine should not be coming through the back of my damn plate mail lol.
---
The way osrs handled this was point out in game when the bug would've happened with some sort of Easter egg or the npc says something to the effect of "hmmmm looks like I don't remember how to open the door, good thing this other cool npc is here to kick the door open."
---
Yeah Babyl!
---
Reminds me when I played with my first character - a female Human Mage (I came from Diablo 2 and there I played Sorceress, so I thought if I make a female Human Mage, it will be closest to Diablo 2 and it will be easier for me... WoW was also my first MMORPG) and when I left Northshire Valley, reached Goldshire and wandered around and saw how this world literally has no end... my jaw dropped. At the time I thought I wouldn't have the time to explore everything this game has to offer.
---
It's a virtual server that shares the same player DB.  They will automatically create new servers (layers) when one is filling up, and destroy one (merge two together) when the population of the layers drops.
---
#NoChanges

Happened to darkspear
---
That is simply not casual. That's 1/4 of each weekday and 2/3 of each weekend day, spend on it. You may treat it like casual, but its on the same level as elite sport, when it comes to time commitment.
---
If you spend that much time gaming, you are more then a casual player. You are a regular player, borderlining streamer/content creator numbers.
---
I know people who would 100% get your IP address and leak your info for being that big of an asshole. Be careful who you fuck with online man. Not saying it’s right of them to do that, but it’s also not safe to be an asshole online anymore.

This experience is how most MMORPG's are.
---
Thanks for the wand guide
---
When zg comes out. Aoe farm that
---
Undead. A bulky orc sneaking around makes no fucking sense. Undead are way cooler, but also very cliché. Sooooo many people will be playing undead rogues.
---
All builds are viable
---
Empty slots are viable, meaningless word in vanilla
---
You will never get anywhere with this guy who doens't understand seal of light, lol
---
A holy paladin can maintain seal of light very easily. You just take the talent he alluded to improved seals. Most mobs will be dead by time you need to think about auto attacking to maintain seal
---
As soon as you give that guy loot. No one good will stay.
---
40 man raiding is about standards, as you will find out when you can't progress past BWL.
---
We have optimal specs for the talents, the guy isn't gonna come up with anyything clever. Neither are you. Neither is anyone.
---
The only differences will be in reactino to the differences between p servers and classic servers. Everything else will stay the same. And none of those changes will effect healing.
---
Game is not very complicated, lol
---
Same order as you. LFD unfortunately killed wrath for me.
---
Best in slot
---
I always enjoyed the faction fight in TOTC, but the rest of it was sort of meh.
---
Classic WoW is not difficult in terms of game play and mechanics, it takes extremely more so coordination, planning, and organization than all expansions after it.
---
if you watch old school swifty videos he was mostly better than your average high skilled warrior because he just had extreme knowledge of the game and farmed out unique items to help him defeat most matchups.
---
the difficulty in vanilla raiding was getting 40 competent players together.
---
also speed playing has always been a part of gaming.
---
if OP wants to "rush" because he only has 2 weeks to play then whats the harm?
---
If i "rush" so i can get started on some cool OP items in engineering than whats teh harm? I get to have fun doing some Wpvp and running my favorite dungeons (BRD, scholo, strath)
---
also you still having explained what rushing is.
---
My main on live is on an RP-PVP server. Lots of lore based guilds, lots of scheduled lore-based PvP. Lots of guilds that defend a specific area in the world because it's considered their duty. ie: night elf guild can be found defending Northern kalimdor zones.
---
Some cons are if you're playing with friends who aren't into RP, they will get frustrated that they have to play a certain race or follow certain rules to join a certain guild. If you wanna join an orc guild to loktar ogar but your friends are undead it won't work. Also the PvP is not the most bleeding edge because the best PvPers will likely flock to certain realms.
---
Dungeons for pre-raid and making sure I have the required consumables for the first raid night.
---
Why would it be considered manipulation of the economy? Unless there's provable cross-faction cooperation, it's just people killing elite mobs and PvP'ing.
---
You're asking "why rush to 60 **when you can enjoy the game as you go**". You're implying that if you don't take your time leveling, you won't enjoy the game. Loaded question gets equal responses :P
---
I do think we'll see some meta changes due to launching on 1.12 for exactly the reasons you mentioned. Druid tank will be more viable from day 1, so guilds will be more open to using them, and more druids will have a set of tanking gear.
---
In progress raids going full Resto might be necessary (especially for AQ and Naxx), but when you have a lower tier raid on farm the good old 30/0/21 build is quite alright, especially if you use consumables, unless you are in the caster group.
---
You don't be able to aoe farm brd while leveling, not in a long shot.
---
Crazy to think that each one is a real person sitting behind a computer somewhere in the world.  I wonder how much money is represented here in terms of technology hardware?
---
Oh wow, thats interesting! Thanks
---
What’s the TLDW of it ?
---
More edge than a pizza cutter.
---
&gt;Just your Dota example. I know this might be a difficult concept for you, but it's called 'inference'. OP was referring to balance in the form that you get in retail. The Rock/Paper/Scissors doesn't necessarily imply a good, or any, balance. Some would say that RPS is unbalanced, but still fun  
---
Wrong on multiple levels. Why are you even talking about subject you dont understand?  
---
Retail is balanced around 3v3 arena. PVE is balanced around equality in damage and utility.  
---
OP of the chain was saying that rock&gt;scissors is a good and fun way to balance things, clearly implying thats what vanilla is like (subject was about vanilla wow after all).  
---
Dota example is not "interference", its example of the best rock&gt;scissors balance there is. That's all there is to it.  
---
&gt;You can level in BG's. You don't have to PvE at all. Some people never raid.  
---
Yea good luck with that.  
---
Again, people that dont play PVE are tiny minority, which reflects the content blizzard made throughout the game's lifespan.  
---
&gt;That's the only part that matters. The amount of, or the time required to create, content has nothing to do with how popular it is or how often it gets utilized.
---
It does. If more people played PVP than PVE then blizzard would realize they are wasting money on making PVE content and focus more on PVP.  
---
For example, the only reason Blizzard bothers making Raids today is due to LFR. If they removed LFR it would be just waste of resources to continue with making raids as they have been making them so far, because smaller and smaller amount of people raid on higher difficulties. Their words.  
---
&gt;The point was they planned to only have PvP servers. "... as a base". As in, the core of the game. 
---
That's like saying reading quests is core of the game. Its there. Its in your face. Most people skip it.  
---
&gt;Nah, only PVP servers indicates that it was meant to be a PVP game. They didn't add PvE servers until people said they wanted it and the money started rolling in  
---
Not at all. If it was PVP game, why was there no PVP content at all? No battlegrounds, no PVP gear system. Yet tons of dungeons and raids.   
---
Again, PVP and PVE server distinction is meaningless. Some people didnt like aspect of ganking and pvp, thats why they created PVE servers. Server type does not reflect what is happening on that server for the most part.  
---
Server type is mostly tied to outside world gameplay experience. Nothing else.  
---
&gt;The entire game, outside of instances, is PVP content.  
---
Wrong. Entire game is PVE. PVP can only be achieved if you come across opposing faction, which can be very rare and sometimes not happen for a long time depending on location and time. Outside world is majority PVE, just like the rest of the game (questing, grinding, professions).  
---
I don't know why you keep on insisting on spreading that bullshit when its just factually wrong.  
---
Questing is pve, grinding is pve, professions are pve. The ony PVP thing is other players, which you may not even come across for many hours of gamepaly.  
---
&gt;It's not the same thing. That's why they added them in the first place. So people could stay in the main city and keep doing stuff like Tradeskills/AH while queueing. The battlemasters being more accessible is their entire point and is the difference.  
---
But it is the same thing. The only reason they are added is accessibility. Same reason they added option to Q anywhere. Accessibility.  
---
Running to portal to Q or running to battlemaster to Q. Zero difference in the mechanic, only one is more convenient.  
---
&gt;Rofl. Says the guy whose only argument is 'Nuh uh! You're a do-do head!". Grow up.  
---
Yes that is my entire argument. Not these whole comments with mutliple arguments and points.  
---
Sad my dude. You can't even finish the comment without sounding salty, sad and ignorant.  
---
"Let me just address these 10 arguments 1 by 1 and then finish off by saying he didn't make any arguments, holly gee im smart"  
---
fucking yikes
---
So you guys admittedly stunk and cleared the easiest raid in game and a “few” bosses in bwl and that makes the game easy?
---
Uhh no that is definitely not from a private server... You really think any private servers back then were functioning that well AND had cross realm bgs with real server names?
---
Did you also completely ignore the linked patch notes? lol
---
Some EJ post doesn't mean anything when looking at actual video evidence and actual blizzard patch notes. Also, that post was a repost of an old guide and as you can see in patch 1.7.0 they fixed the bug where the tooltip was not taking into account the time for the shot portion of aimed shot (Additional 0.5 seconds)
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_1.7.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.7.0)
---
I'm still deciding what my early moves will be for professions, but I'm thinking about going herb/skin for early cash. I like getting my mount as soon as I hit 40.
---
I don't know if you have to speak RP-ish all the time. Don't be surprised if people do, and don't be a douche to people who are RP'ing. It would be a good idea to limit your speech to things related to the game world - not outside stuff like current politics or outside issues.
---
If this subreddit is anything to go on, itll probably be dkp.  More cutting edge guilds will likely be council though.
---
That's some quality gatekeeping there.
---
I played Vanilla when it was current. Didn’t have to plan anything. Play the game and have fun. Just let things happen and experience them when they do.
---
Brock's Blizzcon answer definitely sparked a big backlash. JonTron did a video on it some time afterwards. JonTron's video is in my mind the "big" event that began the process that has given us classic
---
Most guilds on pservers use loot council. Basically the officers decide who gets what based on how good of an upgrade it is, performance, how much loot already given etc. etc. lots of factors.
---
Things will be much easier for anyone levelling in Classic today versus those of us who were playing relatively blind / were noobs etc back in 2004-2005.   
---
Streamers have been reporting lower damage numbers and quicker recovery times after combat as well, at least the sub 30 level.
---
However certain pets, at least the IMP pre level 10 has been getting 1 shotted instead of being able to tank ALOT, so maybe a though few levels for locks before VW.  
---
I'm happy to come back and post my /days played for my toons when they hit 60. Cheers
---
Because enjoyment is subjective man.  Because other people might not find "rushing to 60" and "enjoyment" as things that are diametrically opposed to each other.  Because different people enjoy different things differently.  That's the simple answer.
---
Lots of great feedback here. I did think of Lock instead of Mage. Here was what made the difference to me.
---
With the majority of dungeons before 60 that we run being living vs undead I think that sheep will be really necessary if we try to 3 man. Plus lots of food and drink if we want to cut down on downtime.
---
I think a big challenge of the fresh server will be mats and gold and traveling quickly. This will allow us to set our hearthstones to the closest inn and port to IF or SW when needed. 
---
Plus we still get water elemental to hold one mob up for 45 seconds and that slowing AOE .
---
Lastly I’ve played both and think the Mage is more noob friendly. 
---
#Priest vs Pally, I’d add Druid to this for heals.
---
Settled on Pally for the following reasons vs other two.
---
Druid can’t Rez, that was a deal breaker for me. Other than that I think it would have been great to have MOW and someone not competing for same type loot. Then there is the damage, as far as I’m aware it’s quite a chore to heal and DPS in the instance what with the shape shifting and spec.
---
Priest- Really lived the healing abilities but as I recall you are mega squishy and can’t do much damage at all. Skill cap is high to for someone who’s never played a mmo before.
---
Pally- As a Ret you could step in and DPS and put on ok damage, back out and heal, and you have that awesome bubble and lay on hands in an emergency. Can Rez and can buff bot. Plus in pvp I remember having a Pally heal bot me and we were almost unkillable in AV.
---
Lastly on the professions. 
---
First run though I liked 
---
Warrior- Skin/mining , then flip to blacksmith engi
---
Pally- Herbalism/Alchemy then flip to engi, alchemy 
---
Mage- Tailor/enchanter (whole time)
---
I plan on buying very Valuable recipes and owning the AH with the items. Lionheart helm etc. 
---
Roll Alts at 60 and do the same with other toons. Maybe then do a different combo
---
Druid -Tank 
---
Priest-Heals
---
Lock- DPS
---
Asmongolds stream.
---
I think I still have the mallet of ZF in my warrior's bank...
---
How is it picking apart functions? Layers divide a realm into many realms. Which makes it impossible to guarantee that you run into the same people even if you picked the same realm.
---
Damn dude, I hope you warmed up some

6 days ago...
---
When I tried making an orc on retail, there were multiple level 1s on these motorcycle mounts, where their characters would just sit in a comfy side care with some butler npc driving them around. multiple. AT LEVEL 1
---
Of course when DM and ZG is out this will be better, but im wondering whats the most effective method before that
---
Yep. Parry haste is enabled on almost all bosses, and disabled on a handful big/slow hitters like Patchwerk.
---
They've redone several dungeons either as part of Cataclysm, or other leveling revamps related to dungeon finder.  Most dungeons have been hit by this:
---
* SFK, Stocks, and Deadmines are the same maps, but completely different in terms of the enemies and bosses
---
* RFC has had some of the side paths closed off
---
* Wailing Caverns has been shrunk down so it's about half as long and it's far easier to find your way through
---
* Scarlet Monastery has been completely redone, and is now 2 dungeons.  One is a combination of Library + Armory, the other is Graveyard + Cathedral.  It flips the order of everything, too, as the order is now Armory -&gt; Library -&gt; Graveyard -&gt; Cathedral.  (The Herod fight is actually better, in my opinion).
---
* Maraudon and Dire Maul have officially been split into 3 instances.
---
* Blackrock Depths has also been split into thirds, but only the first third and last third have LFG entries (meaning to complete the quests you need to convince a group to keep going).
---
* Most dungeons have their quests at the start of the dungeon, or given to you as you do the dungeon (like a scenario quest), instead of being part of the world.
---
* Dungeons now level scale, like everything else, so you can do RFC at level 58 and it's not much easier than it was at 15.
---
* I didn't list them all, but most dungeons had some minor things to scale them down (like RFC) or change the NPCs inside.  A lot of bosses have had mechanics added or changed to be more modern.
---
However, we're talking specifically about Sunken Temple, and that one got probably the worst treatment.  The circular room with the hole in the middle that was full of green dragons, is now about the only room in the instance.  There's a few side rooms, but that's about it.  The entire lower half of the instance is completely removed, including the statue puzzle, and the upper half has been condensed.  It's horrible.
---
This is something you should attribute to Asmongold, not the Alliance. Esfand and Staysafe aren’t complaining about PvP. Esfand may nod in agreement with Asmongold once in a while because he’s a cuck.
---
As for Asmongold, he’s garbage at PvP and goes on his period whenever someone ganks him, moaning about it for the next hour. That guy actually thinks Blizzard is gonna ban people for just following him around.
---
Seriously! I agree! 
---
It felt like you were taking down an empire
---
im going to a pvp server
---
Vanilla had the best leveling and endgame quests, TBC had the best raiding, Wrath nailed it's theme and storytelling (also Ulduar, so best single raid).
---
Wrath is also when it started to feel like a different game.
---
Achievements were introduced in the 3.0 patch, so technically in TBC but not really.
---
Yeah I understand.
---
I have a job and don’t want to share my account so I couldn’t care less about r14. You act like anybody that isn’t already legitimately poopsocking WoW on unemployment checks stands a chance at most of that shit.
---
The stress test no. The beta, yeah mostly.
---
Yeah, fairly well known. Had a girl in our guild who made a comic about us and the server, which was featured on the official WoW pages a couple of times.
---
In addition to that, being one of the oldest guilds on one of the biggest servers.
---
So not Method-like famous, but when the comics were featured on Blizzards websites I had several people from other servers logging on just to chat with me every day :p
---
Oh man ice barbed spear, been a long time since I heard that name
---
You’re supposed to be testing the game and reporting bugs and helping improve it. That’s what you sign up for as a beta tester.
---
Jeez this really shows alliance must be practicing tae Kwon do or something. The horse seem so sloppy.i had an undead rogue in vanilla but now this brings another light to the decision lol.
---
TBC heroic dungeons were the pinnacle of the 5 man game for me. Mythic+ just did not do it for me whatsoever.
---
A lot of raiding guilds will transfer from pservers as a unit and most use loot council, so you can bet that you'll be able to find loot council guilds to join.
---
Otherwise it's impossible to say. I'm sure every loot system will pop up somewhere. A good bet is that systems that are easier for officers to implement will be more common case. Systems that basically require a website to track attendance, gear awards, and other shit that gives "points" aren't likely to be the standard. No one raids to do a bunch of data entry in a website.
---
For World of Fashioncraft, you have to go Gnome on Alliance or male troll for horde. There are no other options. They are the flashiest. Also, animegnome.
---
Was your main named Legolazz by chance?
---
Sorry i was thinking about DME at around lv 53, but that won‘t be out.
---
That's what I was looking at too.  Plus I could cash in on that sweet devilsaur leather.
---
But but... “layering will make the game feel empty!!!” LMAO
---
I feel this too. I don't PVP outside of a casual level so I'm curious what expansion is considered to have good PVP. I personally had fun with it in MoP and WoD.
---
She jumps. I intentionally kept the jumping animations a bit higher vertically to indicate that they lift off from the ground and how high they approx. jump.
---
Are you sure it's the attacker's weapon speed? That seems really odd.
---
In a well run guild, this is by far the best way to distribute loot.
---
alright. Ima play the game and have fun.
---
You have never described rushing so for all i know we arent even in a disagreeance on that.
---
i also doubt that people dont have to plan, i started raiding when raids were 25 and 10 man, and even then you had to plan and schedule and organize.
---
in vanilla wow its even more so because its 40 and 20. PVP isnt entirely skill based and you could farm out items that helped you gain advantages.
---
I think this is what a lot of people are missing in the conversation.

"Levelling in Classic is fun! Why wasn't it like this for retail?"
---
Because you've done about 1/4 of the levelling...once. When you have 3 or 4 alts at 60, lets see how much you are relishing the joy of single pulling kobolds in Loch Modan. 
---
The state of leveling in Retail isn't perfect, and it's especially bonkers to have scaling in current content, but after a number of alts, I prefer it to Vanilla.
---
Until you make the mistake of joining their guild and you don't notice straight away : /
---
Scrolled too far for this comment.
---
Throw in TBC class balance and you've got a winner
---
You're absolutely right, for an unoptimized run.  Which is precisely the reason why Joana went from over 10 days, to less than 5 days.  However, even the most well-studied speed runners have stated that they highly doubt you could improve on Joana's original time much more than 10-15 hours.  There will always exist that static, unoptimizable portion of leveling that you can't do anything about.
---
#science?
---
1. If their main cleared it, then their main gets to look "bad ass". The alt didn't clear it, so isn't bad ass.
---
2. People can just faceroll through lower level content for transmogs. You can do something entirely trivial on your main, and get the cool look for both your main and your alt, totally undeserved.
---
3. Not that even your main that did it at the appropriate level should have transmog. Other players should be able to see what gear your have on without you being able to disguise it.
---
One of the few times I’ve tuned into his stream, his 10man premade lost to a horde pug in WSG.
---
Put up immolate, spam shadowbolt. Top dps and threat meters. lol
---
Hogger
---
It was called Google Videos back then.
---
Morph effects adjust (Reduce) your hitbox.
---
yeah but people will sub to this subreddit after realizing how great the game is
---
Well it is. If you play for 20 hours a day, it's basically very similar to time play in-game. The more you play, the closer it is. I am not sure why you are quite upset over all this with negative attitude. Bad day?
---
Hunter benefits from lower TPS because of Feign Death, too. A mage can't remove themselves from the threat table like that.
---
I would guess most will use a 0DKP or loot council system.
---
Harvest watchers. Huge hp pool and hit like a truck.
---
"Classic will be a small fringe, outdated game".
---
I completely agree.
---
Vanilla raids are very straight forward. It only looked hard because everyone was an autistic 12yo at the time. Modern players will crush these.
---
Yea the multiple spec balance really made raiding a pleasure.
---
Paladin/warrior is pretty legit. You can both tank and dps while leveling which is really flexible. The paladin can also heal if he picks up some int gear along the way. 
---
Another great combo is warlock/shadowpriest. The dps you do is just obscene and you can both go for mana inefficient specs and spells because you kill stuff so quickly. The shadowpriest can also heal in dungeons.
---
That's not what you said though, you said "it's just a beta test". You were implying that it's insignificant, and therefore shouldn't be a big deal to want to be in. That had nothing to do with you now saying it's about me over others.
---
No need to vanish, we’ve got sprint (with or without talent improv), blind, grenades, poisons reduced movement and casting, gouge and thristle teas as many as I want to, don’t forget faps.
---
As soon as I’m anywhere near you I’ll use vanish between dot ticks to cheap shot you
---
You’re delusional if you think rogues won’t close that gap asap and slap yo ass
---
Find me in STV and I’ll show you
---
OC post yesterday, took apart the grinder cause it was acting up.
---
&gt;**Abandoned old zones** (BC)
---
So lvl 1-58 stuff is in for decoration?
---
that would be a huge mistake on their part
---
The dwarves are too drunk to care. Fuck the gnomes.
---
This doesn't 'prove' they are in another layer. It could be a bug with the guild window.
---
&gt; Yes and there was no actual evidence that it was the case that private server dungeons were easier just some people who felt that way, and the fucking goalpost moves every time.
---
No you have it backwards. It seems that private servers were *harder*, not easier. I played on Nostalrius, I can definitely attest to the fact that SFK is significantly easier in the beta (based on watching streams). I'm not making any claims about who is right and who is wrong, but there is definitely a difference, and I'm not the only one to have noticed it.
---
&gt; Then they showed that that boss from deadmines is basically the same as he was on private servers. Then it became non-instance, non-boss elites that were "twice" as hard on pservers, without any proof.
---
Pretty much immediately people pointed out that we already knew this. People were interested in the elite mobs, not the bosses, as they had already been verified to match private servers. Blizzard still has not commented on elite mob damage.
---
&gt; And fwiw tanking 6 mobs in SFK wasn't that hard for a decently geared tank. The hard part was holding threat on 6 mobs when thunderclap was capped at 4 mobs.
---
It wasn't about him holding threat, it was about the damage he was receiving.
---
Cant play stoned, But you know my ass is day drinking!
---
Yeah and having white hit from your offhand mean you generate rage even when using heroic strike.
---
Horde player here who considered to go Alliance for Classic. Rolled on a pserver, reached quite a high level, started missing my mudhuts and not even the awesomeness of Dwarfs could compensate how bland most of the Alliance was.
---
Just stay Horde, and as a bonus you can participate in ganking all those obnoxious attention whores. If we do it for enough time, a lot of those streamers will give up and move back to retail and this community will improve.
---
Was so fun when you could use rogues to interrupt with fan of knives. Darn that thing was broken
---
Sunken Temple and BRD for me. I liked Sunken Temple because it really was a mini adventure just to get in that place .
---
Instance farming by mages, locks, and hunters peaked near the end of vanilla. Blizzard tweaked it a few times and then stopped worrying about it because the imminent release of TBC made the techniques obsolete. You can bet that if Blizzard devs planned on spending years longer in Vanilla they would have continued to tweak instance farming to decrease the profit -- just like they eliminated the profit from rogues farming SM Lib earlier in vanilla. Blizzard didn't like solo instance farming and were cautiously tweaking and adjusting their way down the road to eliminating it -- but then the TBC buzzer rang and there stopped being a point.
---
Consequently while we might launch with no changes, I half expect Blizzard to spend time tweaking instance farming in the spirit of picking up the loose threads of vanilla where they left them at the launch of TBC. But they won't be able to do it right away -- they still have to be cautious so as to not disrupt DM:E, Tribute, Mara, etc... for groups. So there will be a window after the launch of DM where you'll be wise to go ham in there and farm up before it's nerfed.
---
That's what it sounds like from the description... But I don't know that it is the case for a fact... Bit of an ambiguous formulation 🤷‍♂️
---
That's my goal as well, I started right around December '04 but I was 10 so I never managed to even hit 60 until TBC came out
---
Sounds like you got everything figured out and dont need to play classic then
---
I played vanilla and 90% of people called it DM.
---
If anything it’s the newer players that started calling it VC
---
The one that youll play Diablo Immortal on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73yT9UXJLT0
---
I think that was later though. But in vanilla pretty sure spells had a 1% chance to miss on all things. Someone on the forums back then with a human mage had like +11% hit or so and went around frostbolting critters for hours and recorded the results with a video of part of it and had numerous resists on lvl 1-5 critters. I don't see how that could have been the case if there wasn't a 1% for spells.
---
So, youd prefer hour+ long que times to log in?
---
True. I never minded First + Last names in games too.
---
Indeed, as long as the council is completely objective this is hands down the best. It allows your guild to gear up as a whole rather than having a few powerhouse characters. Minimizes loss when someone decides to jump ship.
---
MURLOCS
---
I tend to agree with you.
---
Computed AP, Crit, Hit for Bonescythe Waistguard: +47, +1.83%, +0.00%
---
Computed AP, Crit, Hit for Belt of Never-ending Agony: +64, +1.00%, +1.00%
---
**Belt of Never-ending Agony has 17 more AP, 0.83% less crit, and 1.00% more hit.**
---
I have not run/seen the numbers, but I am willing to bet that the AQ belt does indeed give a few extra DPS, because even with talents+high end AQ/Naxx gear in your other slots, you will only have \~+15% hit, well under the DW penalty, while your Backstab crit chance as a combat dagger rogue is around 40% **with talents alone**, with gear you are easily at crit cap and not sorely in need of more crit.
---
This is all speculation though. What we can say for sure is that those two belts are definitely the top 2 with no others really coming close, so you can't really go wrong with either one.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail
---
&gt;Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or **services** to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit.
---
Emphasis in bold. Good luck learning English!
---
Until they realize the time investment required to do so....
---
I'm dipping 100% into the classic pool. There is just too much crap in retail now.
---
Logitech G600 is a solid mouse. And Logitech has good customer support in case an issue arises.
---
No. I'll severely miss transmogs; it's one of the few things that comes close to being a deal-breaker and why I won't abandon retail entirely.
---
I'm not excited about per-character mounts, either, considering how bloody poor you are in vanilla wow and how expensive they are. Going to be walking everywhere.
---
Frankly, I'd like the Classic mechanics with the Retail graphics and conveniences. I like what I've seen so far with the skill trees and needing actual items to do stuff (you need  flint &amp; steel &amp; wood to start a fire, OMG!). I like realizing that professions will *matter*, because quest gear is crap and crafted is better. I'm going to need bigger bags, though.
---
I think that you yourself have been inadvertently whooshed
---
Human female looks the best imo
---
[It seems like you never watched the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE), so here it is. Brack doesn't talk at all about the stuff you mention. His entire thing is QoL upgrades
---
I think you don't understand what "mostly" means. It means "majority".
---
2k Classic Beta players...does this means 1001 of them are streamers?
---
I mean...come the fuck on dude.
---
They would be idiots if they do anything like that as Classic WoW is the only positive thing with Blizzard atm but if they did I wouldn't be surprised at all.
---
yikes
---
It affects if you can fast clear MC or not at a certain point with a DW fury tank while you're farming Bindings and Eyes.
---
right click causes causes you to turn to face the mouse. It's intentional.
---
Also, looting causes you to switch targets so if you don't position yourself to target the mob, and time your loot behind autoswings, it's going to cost you an attack anyway.
---
oc?
---
You won't find me because as I said the name will sit unused forever. No one will use it.
---
So you can disguise your T3 as T2? No way, other players should be able to see what gear you have on.
---
I liked BC more than vanilla, but I do think playing melee dps was a bit too hard in heroics and raids.
---
But every spec was viable, and everything felt like vanilla, which hits the spot as far as I'm concerned.
---
Original content
---
Which is to say, Classic is very alt-hostile.
---
No i'd prefer more servers
---
Just like they had in vanilla
---
Why would you think that's the only option?
---
And we had dynamic spawns. SO they could up the cap if they wanted too.
---
Either would be a better solution
---
Ion needs to be fired
---
400 chest x-rays

A simp would think that. But it's actually code for Big Green C\*\*\*s exciting your women, sacking their vulnerable spots. Get back to your books boy. Your women need real men in their lives.

ah okay, haven't looked fully so I'll check it out

To be fair, we were really abusing the layering system in that screenshot

As good as Will of Forsaken may be, don't underestimate the value of Orc stun resist. Plus, WoF only really works against priest since the have a CD on fear, locks on the other hand, not so much.

Starting the hella long quest chain to get attunement to Onyxia's Lair.
---
EDIT: Forgot you also have to get "Attuned" for Molten Core, so that also.
---
Well then I'm happy I was able to shed some light in my previous comment as to what I meant.
---
I’ll be playing because No flying, no lfg, slower leveling, simple rotations, world pvp.
---
Look at this fella reaping downvotes from no-fun-allowed babies that can't take a joke
---
sweet strat, thanks for explaining
---
Maybe it's not a private server but it doesn't explain why he has silencing shot. And yes the EJ post is conflicting evidence. Like you said those data bases don't mean anything. Maybe the tool tip is busted idk im just trying to figure it out not trying to argue with you.
---
Fair enough, not sure who down voted you.
---
Even without the title my point still stands: no one other than asmngold and friends will have a chance to meaningfully compete in the AQ gong event on that server.
---
Those were all someone's alts, since the bike with side car mount is a reward for 35 heirlooms.
---
No, it is not the only difference. You shouldn't be able to disguise your gear. Other players should be able to see the models of the actual items, and have a chance to figure out what you are wearing.
---
PvP should not have someone looking like they have 700 health, but actually have 2500 health.
---
To each their own I guess, ot was the complete opposite for me. I was bored out of WoD after 2 weeks of reaching max level and playd maybe like 3 months over the 2 year period. Legion on the other hand was actually the very first expansion since the games release where I never stopped my sub (even if I did stop playing for a few weeks during the expac). I loved Legion.
---
can ghost wolf be used in combat?
---
&gt; Vanillafriends.com
---
holy shit - how have i never seen this website - has no one posted a reddit thread about this site?
---
Just play on a server with no streamers?
---
100%
---
Nah, you're full of shit.  Or in fancier language, "implausible assertion not supported by evidence".
---
Anyone who tries to argue against transmog would rather play a MOBA than an actual RPG.
---
For leveling, yes. People are saying it takes 15 to 30 percent longer, because mobs actually use their abilities.
---
Tauren rogues would have to be gnomes using the orb of deception, so definitely SS.
---
Furbolg Shamans in the Ban'ethil Barrow Den. Not only is it a narrow dungeon area, the mobs run, and these  Shamans heal 80% of everyone's healthbars! Shitters always run, pull more then get heales almost back to full. 
---
These dummies are a BIG reason why the barrowden is like a lvl 8 raid for NELFS
---
If I wouldn't know any better, I'd say you're trolling.. but sadly you're right.
---
My 2 favorite dungeons were Zul'Farrak and Scarlet Monastery 
---
Mostly because i have so many good memories from running them. Huge extensive dungeons that i ran repeatedly. So many unique items that dropped from both.
---
I hope i can create new good memories when Classic comes.
---
So excited.
---
You arent wrong in the sense that a ton of layers of multiple virtual servers will be on the same physical server, this is called efficiency, because their hardware exceeds the computing necessity, BUT
---
You will absolutely be bound to your virtual server and those layers will disintegrate over time.  Those virtual servers will have the same communities until a day comes where low pop realms will probably have to merge.
---
Man, Deadmines might be the best dungeon in any MMORPG in history from my POV.
---
It has everything, a fluent run, easter eggs, crazy moments when you run it the first time or the third, things like aggro on the ship, explosions, goblins... Also, it´s the first dungeon many people do. I ran it a thousand times and I still love it so much.
---
Yeah, but in this picture there are like a gazillion raids.
---
Layering, while being non-Vanilla is clearly better than sharding...for a limited time frame.
---
Yes, there is warn, info and verbose. You can filter afterwards. If you want to investigate a problem you need it to be verbose. This isn't a summer student project, this is near a hundred processes working on a machine.
---
Idk about on live but in pservers there is a way to hop around the gate!
---
Losing the full package of rogue CDs to specific builds was low-key heartbreaking, lol. Plus, subtlety got turned into lol-ninja button mashing, or at least it felt like that compared to vanilla - maybe I didn't play it enough to appreciate the * ahem * subtlety of the build /shrug
---
You can think of it in simple terms like :
---
    Magtheridon (realm):  
---
        Magtheridon-1   (layer)   
---
        Magtheridon-2    
---
So everyone logged into Magtheridon-1 is still on Magtheridon, can only see people on Magtheridon, etc. However, for the first 2-3 months of classic, Magtheridon will be able to have unlimited players logged in at once, logging into clones of Magtheridon. It’s all still Magtheridon, but way more people can be online at once. 
---
Sharding breaks it up by zone, and tries to converge all the people across all servers in a given zone together so the zone feels alive. 
---
    Barrens (shard)   
---
        Fuzz-Magtheridon (player)   
---
        Fuzz-Thrall   
---
        Fuzz-Mal’ganis    
---
     
---
Layers are like expansion joints. Expand when there’s too many players, non-existant when there’s fewer players. Layers exist only to solve the problem of an overloaded server by making copies of it. Shards are virtual cross-server zones, that always exist, disconnecting the Zone from the Realm (basically eliminating Realms all together). Shards are a different paradigm that exist to solve server load, but also to make dead zones and servers feel alive.
---
BC or WotLK might be better, but since fans of BC or WotLK would also be drawn to Vanilla, Vanilla is the best version to rally people behind.  
---
Secondly, people have been pushing for legacy Vanilla servers for a very long time, and if Blizzard releases a legacy server that came after Vanilla, a bunch of those players would be alienated, thus reducing the ability of the community to rally behind the classic server.
---
Having the whole community rally behind the classic server is more important than you think it is.
---
Go play your dress up simulators some more, you’re not meant to be on this subreddit if you don’t want vanilla back.
---
Oh for sure, your point was definitely valid - it‘s extremely unlikely anyone on a server with any of the big streamers has a shot of getting that mount, unless an extreme counter culture somehow develops.
---
He probably doesn't.
---
Viper Sting.

https://vanillawowdb.com/?spell=3034
---
Except engineers.
---
Yes, you will
---
Also look at it from pvp. Part of the skill cap is from looking at someone, knowing their capabilities based on gear knowledge and fighting that person accordingly. I would fight someone with warglaives much differently than dalrends
---
Would the dongeon set be bis for most classes or not necessarily?
---
Massive buff for raiding hunters. DPS will be more threat-capped compared to pservers. Hunters can feign death and go wild while the mage is holding back, waiting for the tank to build more threat.
---
We'll see, I could only get as much as a 3 person party last night and and 3 person group was 1.14 based on level 1 and level 2 mobs.
---
Hardcore guilds with a pretty permanent roster will use loot council.  Otherwise they will most likely use zero sum dkp.
---
My server in vanilla had set up a server-wide EPGP system back in '05.  It wasn't called EPGP, but was called "zero sum dkp with weekly decay and all items have a set price".  I honestly think that was the best I ever saw for server-wide pugs.

---
Well, after many dozens of hours having fun in STV I can say few rogues were a challenge at all. Even if you manage to pull all of that off, many classes can reset the encounter. As hunter if things really go bad you just trap, get your distance and redot. Mage, pally and priest and even warrior can all reset the fight as well.
---
A few rogues are very good and hard to kill, you might be one of those. But &gt;90% of them are fish out of the water and very easy prey as a somewhat ok hunter.
---
The few times when I got scared fighting rogues are ofc engineer rogues. After being slowed, if the dudes starts casting death ray I'm sure I'm in for a good duel finally.
---
Classic wow can run on a toaster, it was made in it's day to run on old crappy hard ware back in it's day.
---
You would have a hard time finding a machine that couldn't run classic wow on high or better settings perfectly.
---
Thanks for the info and thanks to the Fight Club discord for looking into it.
---
Wasn't it nerfed hard? That would invalidate it imo.
---
We’re trying to go for maximum money. 
---
Gonna use mats to level crafts and vendor or de the result. Plus de as we pick up things. Unless it’s a blue or better boe , or a spell power adding green it’s gonna get sharded and used to sell the mats, enchant our gear or sell enchants in the world.
---
I just healed Sunken Temple last night and the trash in that place hits hard! Especially those fear mobs.
---
Well that was a wave of memories I wasn't expecting
---
So you’d rather have more, empty servers after p1, meanwhile the 2-3 popular servers would still have que times for the duration of classic.
---
You need to think more dude. You have NO IDEA what merging servers entails manpower wise. None of us do. 
---
If you actually played vanilla you should be old enough by now to not act like a entitled child and realize company’s have to make decisions based on cost.
---
Grow up or shut up please
---
It was ok, it just added in or expanded alot on what a lot of what most of us consider the end of the golden era. Stuff like:
---
* Tokens for Tier Gear
---
* Multi- difficulty raids
---
* LFD 
---
* Achievements
---
The key words here being "well run guild".
---
That's actually a huge buff for Taurens.
---
Nope. Those zones were still there, in the game, constantly traversed by high level players. You had low level zones that were directly next to capital cities, you had zones that were hubs for travel, like Ratchet, STV, Barrens, Dustwallow. Low level zones with level 60 raids. And all this stuff was in the same original continent(s). Practically any level 20+ zone in classic was bound to have level 60's in it for one reason or another.
---
Once you teleport everyone to Outland, they are, for all intents and purposes, separated from all 1-60 content. Do you see the clear distinction?
---
BiS should be used for best in slot. IBS is irritable bowel syndrome.
---
Just a LPT ;)
---
Edit: I just realised you were talking about the Ice Barbed Pear lmao. My bad!
---
and then you have wPVP, a whole other unpredictable variable.
---
&gt;vanilla PvE mages that two-shot anything
---
Mages could also be one shot by hunters Aimed Shots, geared Warriors if they got close. Warlocks could one shot classes as well. Rogues could coldblood evis most classes in a few seconds. Shamans could one shot with windfury weapon. However you had a second try as the game was more capture the flag based and a individuals death did not matter like it did in arena. 
---
&gt; These were released in vanilla with epic BG rep rewards, the tier 0.5 set, ZG/AQ in general etc
---
Did you grind rep in vanilla? One kill was 1 reputation point and whatever reputation you get now in retail divide that by 10 and that is what is was in Vanilla. If you received 250 in retail it was 25 in Vanilla. To get exalted with AB would take months and months of playing it. AV was a little faster but took a considerable amount of time as well. Unlike in TBC in which you could do heroics in a few weeks after gearing up for them for comparison. You could also do your 10 arena games a week and get two arena epics very easily and they lowered the rank required each new season for the old gear. Also the PvP reputation weapon epics were always worse DPS wise than MC weapons.
---
&gt;You complain about TBC mace stun but just wait until half the warriors start running around with The Unstoppable Force as a welfare epic rep reward. 
---
It has a very low chance to stun and only stuns for 1 second. Compared to Stormherald in TBC which stunned for 4 seconds, and if you were mace spec you could stun again for 3 more seconds. Vanilla did have Mace spec but it was a 6% chance.
---
gDKP is popular with my old guildies, considering how meaningful gold is in classic.
---
Of course there's more implied courtesy, so no one's going to bid on the right binding of the windseeker when our prot has the left already.
---
Yeah it seems to me that some version of a DKP system is the most just way of doing it. I only ever raided in TBC in a guild that used DKP with a silent one bid per person. Worked just fine
---
Oh wow! We had that many gnomes and dwarves at the arathi bridge also lol
---
That encounter was the make or break for every group I was in.
---
It hasn't been clearly gains or losses, it's just been different. Warriors report way higher regain, mages report way lower. So yes, \*some\* streamers have been reporting quicker recovery, but that's because they play warriors. Other streamers have been reporting way slower leveling.
---
The upshot is that leveling has been sort of normalized: warriors and rogues are better than on pservers, while mana dependant classes are worse, so the advantage of being a hunter is less than it was.
---
Imo early legion was kinda meh. Artifact power grind was slow and pretty alt spec and class unfriendly. But the biggest issue was the legendaries that dropped. Some were signiciantly better than others but it could be up till a month or 2 between each drop so if you got fucked by rng is suuuuucked.
---
Towards the end though is definitely was one of the best expansions. Ap grind was much better with some of the changed catchup mechanics, and it was only a week or so between legendary drops and made it once you had all yours you could receive boa ones for other classes which helped a ton for people who liked alts.
---
Other than those 2 issues it was a pretty fun and good expansion, biggest downside is its when you could see a lot of rng elements start to slip in
---
what if that's their evil plan? Generate og fanbase and create hype and quickly burn out everyone right before a new retail content release?!?!
---
I guess it's subjective, but I'm actually a fan of realistic-looking pieces of gear. Classic, out of any expansion, had the most old-school RPG-looking items (yes, minus the ridiculous shoulderpads, we all know Blizzard artists have a fetish for shoulderpads).
---
In retail I always transmogged to Vanilla items simply because I liked them way more and all the new stuff looks ridiculously insane. That said, I wouldn't want to have transmog in Classic simply because I am absolutely fine with all the items. But, in most cases, you could still form up a great looking set of gear (random parts but following a similar aesthetic), and still get good stats from it. On RP realms this is crucial since it's amazing to actually wear your real set while looking appropriate for the occasion/event/guild.
---
Oh ya, I agree. I actually wish they knew what the wanted but since they’ve never played anything like it I figured these as safe choices.
---
As Pally she can heal or damage or mix both 
---
My son likes to be a shooter so I think he will like mage.
---
If not they can reroll
---
So no, you can't explain it, you just assert a bunch of crap that is the *exact opposite* of immersion. In Real Life, people aren't forced to wear some rags they picked up off a basement floor and never choose their looks; they actually decide how they want to look and buy or have clothes made to fit their desired look. 
---
For true immersion, transmog is required, because the game engine doesn't allow me to take that BiS item to an armorer and have it lacquered with the colors I want. Don't like, don't use.

I figured as much when you talked about the density of logs.  Levels dont have to stick to those 3, I was meaning in a more broad sense.  The same mechanisms you use for filtering can be used which different data retention algorithms.  I'm sure you know this though as the 10 min prior and afterwards would be a form of that,  I was being somewhat tongue in cheek
---
Paladin and mage are both relatively 'noob friendly' classes to, especially playing in groups as the mage doesn't have to worry as much about having aggro.  Spam frostbolt/fireball and use any of these 3 skills if you're in trouble!

I feel this almost every day with my customers.  If they spend $1 or $1m they receive the same treatment, some people get mad about that, but such is life
---
Entitlement is entitlement
---
I have played wow since beta and I have my collectors edition diablo ready for classic and I didnt get beta
---
I get to do projects around the house now that would have inevitably been put on hold had I got in, so in a way, I am almost grateful
---
Running infinitely in circles on top of Org bank, inc.
---
Blizzard Support they got me mine back
---
Considering how many tanks are needed for Four Horsemen, it's not surprising that a guild might require all warriors to be tank-spec for Naxx. 4HM caught a lot of guilds by surprise because they didn't have that many tanks.
---
And THAT is all I was asking for.  Was that so hard?  To provide a link to back up your assertion?  Hopefully this was properly reported as a bug and will be fixed.
---
um.. Int increased spell power. You can int as you level.
---
Contact Blizzard customer support. They're very helpful and will do whatever they can to help you get back into your account. You'll need to know a lot of information to get access without the email though.
---
Yes please this would be amazing. I would be upset to not play on an rp pvp server.
---
then im out my characters ive had since vanilla :/
---
I had a lot of fun during WoTLK.  Vanilla was newbie like fun, and WoTLK was awesome as a player who had been playing for multiple years.
---
We’re playing a fantasy game, it’s not meant to be real life, if you want real life... go outside and wear whatever you want.
---
Way to move the goalposts? You first said that FD doing nothing was a bug and then said it should happen rarely. 
---
Assuming it uses spell hit in 1.12 you should see fd resist on equal level players something like 1 out of 20 times and resist against raid bosses closer to 1/8.
---
Yes FD + trap is common macro in everything but its not 100% reliable
---
Hi, /u/Madorisiath, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
BC was my favorite expansion, I will say I'm am a little bias since I was a noob throughout classic. 
---
BC had alot of the benefits that people love about classic, no sharding, leveling 1-60 was the same, you had to work really hard to earn different mounts and you stood out once you got them, classes where each unique and you noticed the benefits each brought in a group.
---
The huge thing that I love about BC was every class was viable for the role they could fill. Ret pallys weren't a meme. The raids where pretty hard aswell as the dungeons. A lot of people don't like flying but it was only in the outlands and blizz designed a couple of the zones to really highlight flying which was new and very cool at the time I liked flying so it was a highlight for me. Plus you couldn't use flying mounts as ground only mounts which makes sense 
---
I can't wait to ignore my life playing classic but just the thought of a classic BC makes my heart race.
---
they said I didnt have enough info since i'm guessing I might of had my brothers info on the account. Since back then the accounts needed to have matching info to character transfer but I cannot recall 10 years ago :/
---
I remember in TBC i played as Alliance on Coilfang and stormwind was literally farmed by the horde. 
---
It was like a 6:1 horde to alliance ratio, and a PVP realm.
---
It sucked
---
You will make new vanilla characters soon
---
Orc looks good in gear. But I agree if Orc is Rogue might aswell Tauren
---
why would that matter if you are returning for classic?
---
Healed ZF a lot. There were two types of people I remember the most. The DPS’er who rushed down the stairs too early and died. The guy who had to get all of the items the first go round, then wanted the tank and healer to stay behind so he could get the rest.
---
If you are pushing threat after properly vanishing your tank is bad or you are a dagger rogue on vael.
---
Every time I've seen this, officers gear themselves up and people get pissed and leave.
---
Blizzard had a list of what things got the most kills at one point.
---
&gt;how would they even fix that? if they made it so phasing between  layers would bring any tagged mobs with you it would just open a bigger  can of worms with potential exploits and griefing.  they need to just remove it and spin up enough servers for the launch to happen then merge later.
---
I think the issue here is they can see each other already so they should be on the same layer, adding someone to your group should transfer you to whatever layer the party leader is on not put you all in a different layer and despawn mobs
---
Indeed! I'd say they did a good job of turning wow into an action game in legion it was fun. 
---
A shell of it's former self though? Absolutely. It became all about quick fun. Which they did well but still killed what it used to be. Not that it was close to it's old self in WoD lawl.
---
Lmao man he is using my shot timer addon. He is posting a pic of the tooltip. I already stated the tooltip was wrong.
---
Interesting. By custom routes I assume you mean importing your own route? It's very text sensitive, so missing commas or brackets makes tho whole thing invalid and likely botches the the process. If that isn't the case, what browser and operating system are you using?
---
&gt; (except ret on Alliance)
---
[Well, it's alliance, so who cares.](https://imgur.com/gallery/eaQvGdK)
---
Another thing I realized from this discussion is if people were foregoing the 8 set bonus on T3 so they could have ACLG+AQBelt, or foregoing the extra DPS from one of those items in order to get the 8 set bonus, that is now no longer a problem since a 308 soft-cap definitely makes T3 gloves better than ACLG.
---
We will have to see if any of this ends up being true though.
---
Kek
---
I definitely ran down the stairs like an idiot and pulled hahhaha
---
The hardest non-elite mobs in the game are EPL undead / Bats / Silithus Insects.
---
First time? I don't remember.   
---
But I do remember that my healer-friend forced me to go down where they spawn on a second time.
---
So if you're due for a checkup...
---
I live in Chicago so it is accurate. Lol
---
"A well played rogue can pretty much only be beaten by a tauren warrior." Err nope. A good priest, hunter or pally can give a rogue strong headaches.
---
Thank you, I deserved that.
---
Do it, have fun. You won’t gimp yourselves at all by sharing gear.
---
I mean its going to be exciting to see how fast people get 60. Maybe 4 days is doable. Im hoping to get there in 10 days personally tho.
---
This sentence is making me uncomfortable
---
Content after classic will kill it.
---
When they did it in 4 days 20 hours, was there any prep i.e. BiS leveling gear or anything?
---
DO you not get this?
---
Layering = you have no server you idiot
---
lol, it's like you're part of a server group and could randomly get assigned to this or that server each time you log in. And there is now going to be a meta game to abusing the system. 
---
You're not even gonna see ur own guild mates
---
So dense
---
You are not intelligent enough to have this conversation, clearly....lol
---
Please crawl back into whatever hole you came out of.
---
Actually you can. And people have been doing it for the past 24 hours on stress test. Learn patience.
---
It was on multiple times.
---
In what way exactly would that be?
---
Yes youre worrying over nothing.
---
You’re gonna have the most fun with your friend if the both of you play the damn class you want.
---
Crafting professions are not money makers in Vanilla, they're gold sinks. Yes, some can make money, but it'll be months before they're profitable and will pale in comparison to gathering.
---
The funniest thing is it's an applicable quote in many situations. People just can't help but meme. In fact the entirety of retail WoW is a beautiful example of how players think they want something and it turns out being detrimental. "Every spec should be viable in each corresponding role," "5-man dungeons should not take an hour," "You should not feel like you're underpowered if you are missing specific items," "Finding a group to complete a dungeon is too time consuming and unreliable." All the shit people complained about seemed reasonable until you consider the alternative.
---
Silencing shot was introduced in the pre-tbc patch. This video came out shortly after that patch.
---
Please. You're saying you/"we" will wait until the victim has pulled multiple mobs on low health. No one did that, so there was nothing to wait for, so I made a joke. Why you decide to deny that, I don't know.
---
So yes, that was entirely the implication you made, hence the little funny. HEH!
---
Go get the epic mount.  I can’t stress how cool and epic the quest feels to finish for what I always thought was one of the coolest mounts in the game.
---
No idea how Blizzard does it now but they should be able to have you send them a scanned image of your identification and they should help you as long as the name and addresses or past addresses match with the account information.
---
true, maybe this should be made private before the end of august
---

---
I think there was one at one point, that's how I found it. I figured I'd throw it in and help spread the word since it was somewhat relevant to what I was saying. Not enough people signed up yet, but like I said I did have a few people find me through it already.
---
We're not in the UK...
---
a lot of gear is from quest while leveling 
---
in the end it wont matter because you will be regearing at 60, but yes you will have to split some of the more rare drops (but playing with 2 people would mean more kills on npc's so a higher chance of getting more rare items)
---
i wouldnt put too much thought in to it (you can also have one level tailor and one level enchanting and each have another profession to make money like herb and skinning/mining)
---
Getting pretty sick of this meme.  You can't take a screenshot of a bunch of level 1's on a free stress test and be like "WOW LOOK AT THE POPULARITY"
---
Pump the fucking brakes.  You're delusional if you think playerbase isn't going to drop substantially after a week.
---
It was a late entry in vanilla. May as well have been BC
---
That can't be it. There has to be some conspiracy.
---
Yeah, I mean importing my own. I’ll double check to make sure I haven’t missed any brackets etc and get back to you.
---
Taurens kick the ground
---
Spriest + warlock...
---
Your biggest problem is going to be the game seems too easy and you might reroll out of boredom. (I know I did)
---
Leveling tons of your gear comes from quests,  and drops while your out duoing, deciding between yourselfs who needs it more means both of you are better equipped than average.
---
And in dungeons and raids, it won't matter would you rather lose to your buddy than a stranger?
---
You think you will play 80 hrs out of 96? Come on man, that's dumb
---
Seriously though, don't do that.
---
It used to be stickied on here awhile back, I feel like it should once again now we're getting close.
---
They don't need to hide themselves for ever. Just long enough to hit level 10 or get ahead of the pack. So a few hours as opposed to your suggested weeks and weeks and weeks.
---
Nope.  My friend and I made characters to level together, and in most cases it was a disappointment.  
---
The other thing to add on, is that because of heirlooms, you don't even care about gear.
---
The sad reality, however, is that bfa will remain profitable - there are just so many people still hooked. I just hope blizzard is able to pull their way out of this muck and mire they’ve found themselves within, and come out the other end at least relatively clean.
---
How will one guild do something versus another is entirely subjective and literally impossible to field a valid answer for.. That being said interested to see what the majority will do i suppose..
---

---
This is how resistances and armor look like on private servers(light hope servers)
---
It's completely wrong and super generic for most of the bosses, some of the values were leaked in guide books, the rest is generic and made up.
---
Blizzard confirmed that all bosses have customized armor and resistances so this is 110% wrong.
---
It’s a different game entirely, you’ll have to learn everything again basically.
---
Do you think there are spots for shadow priest in end-game raids?
---
It makes sense when you consider that gear was pretty rare, too. You might be competing with 10-15 people for certain items, and you could easily go 2-3 months of raiding before getting your next upgrade.
---
You might farm Ragnaros for a year to get BRE. It's not crazy that it would last until Naxx considering how much effort it took to get it.
---
Ironfoe is something like a 1-2% drop, so it seems alright that it would be something you could use for a long time.
---
This is my experience as well--non-roleplayers often outnumbered roleplayers on these servers, so the roleplayers would usually cloister themselves in guilds and that's where you'd find most of the RP.
---
Of course, other wise the guild is going to fall apart pretty quickly.  It’s the best way to distribute loot but also can cause the most damage to a guild lol
---
there were a time when you could play wsg at lvl 30 and face an opposing team at 40 with mounts, fun fun times
---
It was posted on here a few weeks back when it was first launched. I remember seeing it at the top of the sub.
---
90% of hunters went by that name but mine was the same as my reddit name ;)
---
Rofl ok
---
To be honest, orcs racial is incredibly powerful, but I wouldnt rank them over undead for warlocks.
---
You can deal with all the stuns as undead, in most situations when you are soloing (1vx might get tough but spend that extra money from "free" mounts on them pots). In group pvp, orc racial wont save you from geared group focusing you if your healers and your consums dont save you.
---
And lastly, orc warlocks will have hard time in a mirror against undead and against shadow priests, or priest in general. Meta in group pvp atm is having 2 priest healers/supports in both ab and wsg, plus another warlock. WOTF wont be up in every single skirmish, but when its up it will greatly help you decide those fights. All in all, undead warlock isnt worse than orc warlock, and hardiness is overrated in group pvp.
---
And it’s going to end after phase 1. I’d rather be able to log in during phase 1 than not be able to play at all.
---
You don’t agree with me so your insult my intelligence. Classic middle school. How old are you bro?
---
ok
---
do you think im better off calling in? I tried the messages and it didnt get far since im guessing the info might be under my brothers name... But i still have an ID with my old address on it.
---
Top 3 dungeon for me on vanilla alongside Stratholme and my favorite Schoolmance!
---
Idk, mate. That's a hellofalotof people in the post there and server seams fine. Looks like the servers are fucking beasts this time around.
---
There was fuck all there? lol
---
That's because Overwatch is the only game they care about now. SC2, WoW, Diablo, HotS... All on life support. Only reason we're getting classic is because it's a money printer that they don't have to update after launch.
---
Don't forget the pats that would sneak up and gank your group from behind.
---
If I was on a Rogue doing my 30th run trying to get all the drops off of VC (seriously, there were like 4 drops off of just him alone if you include both Cruel Barbs, and those drops were wanted by everyone except clothies), I would try and solo the overseer + evoker patrols.
---
I fear that you, sir, are the one actually experience a whoosh.
---
a 4 minute video that could have been 10 seconds long
---
no left or right action bars
---
god awful key binds (A on throw dagger?????)
---
awful, annoying music
---
Yup, it's a vanilla video.
---
I think there's a pretty apparent trend that the people who prefer the "pretty" faction (Alliance) are more interested in PvE and less interested in PvP than the "warlike" faction (Horde). It always seems like a larger percentage of Horde players are interested in PvP, but on the other hand a lot of the *best* PvPers go Alliance for the advantages that that faction provides.
---
Obviously I'm not saying that this is the case for every player; there's obviously tons of Alliance that seek out PvP. But I do think that it's at least an apparent trend.
---
You won't play them in classic, and I can assure you they're not worth playing live.
---
I've tried multiple times to go back to my WoTLK account (started vanilla). It's a completely different game and too overwhelming to go back to.
---
Well shit hahaha, hopefully some of the skill crosses over
---
dude i forgot about this. This is actually a good nostalgia post &lt;3 mmm the feels
---
Do you have things completed three months before they’re due?
---
most raids take one tops, in high end guilds anyway
---
now in a more casual guild the main thing is being reliable, if you show up to the raid prepared every week then you should be OK.
---
The Beta doesn't have it.
---
This is the kind of min/maxing I want to see!
---
Some guilds can justify taking one.  
---
Some shadow priests can heal early raids well enough.
---
I would not roll a shadow priest with the intent of raiding though.  You will get very little out of your raids that will help your spec unless you get that coveted spriest slot, which is rare.
---
Holy moly, I forgot about this.  I wonder what else I've forgotten about that will be a blissful surprise...
---
"Cohesion"
---
I've not experienced that in an age.
---
&gt; **I want to roll a shadow priest!** 
---
Roll a shadow priest then.
---
don't worry blizz won't tell anyone about your gigabytes of sailor moon hentai
---
BS gets 2 trinkets around lvl 40 as well, but the quests to get them are extremely expensive.
---
Ahhh didn't know this. Thanks for the info.
---
Maybe its the default choice and most folks didn't care about the stress test character appearances?
---
As someone with a new kid, I look forward to this in raiding. Need to keep it simple while holding the baby.
---
Honestly, if you're new and following a leveling guide, you're going to be hitting the same spots as everyone else, and still going a lot slower than you could be because of inefficient gameplay. They definitely make leveling blind a LOT easier than it's intended to be, but I've had friends who are new to the game still take 250+ hrs /played to get 60 with a guide and a server with high pop, dynamic respawns (ie very fast), and not many other people leveling at the same time to compete with him.
---
I can easily imagine a new player following a guide, and showing up to a spot a level or two behind because he isn't grinding efficiently in between, and then having to compete with 50 other people for an hour to do 1 quest. then not knowing that he can run 500 feet south and grind low-armor mobs for about 3x the experience/hr (which is what you would do if you were actually trying to speedrun to 60). Guides can only do so much, there will definitely still be a lot of confused noobs, which is a beautiful thing.
---
I won't be using a guide this time but that's because I know my own route just from leveling way too many characters over the years, but I would pay so much to have my brain wiped of all Classic knowledge and to level blind again.
---
Almost every damn time when first started running it, I've got crazy bad Murphys Law luck like that though 😉
---
while its not 100% efficient its more important to play what you want
---
Scarlet Friars
---
Legion doesn't have DX12 or multithreading support, neither does the Classic Beta.
---
You'll probably still be able to raid as shadow. However, there won't be a lot of them in a 40 man raid. You'll really want to stand out.
---
We knew it all along. We just didn't know how it would come about.
---
"... Smells like fish in here"
---
Exactly ! ;)
---
Feel free to directly convey your intentions next time instead of using insults, but thanks.
---
The record is just shy of 5 days. Good luck mate.
---
I don’t consider overwatch to be a full game. It’s more like a fragmented series of mini games, especially when compared to Blizzards other successful titles. Overwatch doesn’t even have a custom game mode creator like what WC3 or even games like Halo had. It’s just Blizzards direct copy of TF2. It doesn’t mean it’s bad by any means, I just don’t consider it a full game because there’s really no world surrounding the game. They tease at a world with cinematic trailers, but there will never really be one. Just a bunch of payloads and capture the point maps being re-skinned.
---
Overwatch is essentially what I’d imagine the queue up pvp for Titan would have been, which is why it was so disappointing to me.
---
Does classic not fall within the "consumer goods or services" that is being sold to customers or am i missing something here?
---
Holy hot diggity damn this (and Ulda) were my favorite. You just unleashed a tidal wave of nostalgia on me.
---
I'm ok too :D
---
How did you do Razorgore by just winging it? Thats not a boss you can just tank+spank+see what happens.
---
Yup that’s still there in live. The issue is getting everyone to be able to successfully do it. 
---
Did it the other week while leveling a toon, probably an extra 15 minutes because the one Mage just could not get the jumps down for whatever reason
---
You'll have a tank with VW and the priest can heal while you nuke. You'll have a great time.
---
Huh, I've personally heard otherwise. Nonetheless, good to know.
---
Vanilla naxx wasn't a cakewalk either!
---
I played Vanilla-Wrath and extensively on Pservers, almost solely as a Prot Warrior, and I would never take cloth, leather, or mail from a class that can use it without stating so ahead of time (even if it is an upgrade to my current set). All it takes is a quick party message, "hey, I'm tanking, but looking for the Truestrike shoulders for my fury set". If they're not cool with that, bounce.
---
All in all, it's just bad form man. I can use other pieces, they can't. 
---
Similarly, if I'm fury for a run, I still wouldn't roll on tank gear without clearing it with whoever is tanking.
---
Seeing someone do that would immediately add them to my "do not invite again" list. But that's just me.
---
Edit - I see now that you put "up to 60" but my opinion stands regardless.
---
[Loot lists for the win](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/).
---
WoW on life support lmao.
---
Only spells have 1% chance to miss regardless of hit chance (though it'll show up as "resisted").
---
Playing FFXIV a lot atm and it feels like a RP server. It has the 2 names feature. No clue if im actually on a RP server (you cant chose anything like it afaik) but everyone has names that fit fantasy. Also such a nice community! Havent seen that in another game before.
---
Well organized hotbars and using macros/keybindings goes a really long way to bridge the 'skill' gap learning a new character. Talent trees and different levels of skills (ie. when to use lvl 1 healing spell vs lvl 3 healing spell) will be the first major difference you'll notice coming from 'dumbed-down' BFA .. Good luck in your journey friend.
---
Right? My friends and I wanna get high and run dungeons with the boys. That's our expectations. If we down Nef as our final progression, I'll be more than ecstatic.
---
kiting bosses to stormwind was one of the most fun moments I had in the game. I don't feel like any zone should be truly safe, even cities.
---
normally, but terrain means that the pet might make a turn to go around terrain to get to the mob. Normally the pet follows the same path from you to the mob that the mob will take from current position to you, so not really an issue.
---
If your like most hunters, you keep your pet on passive, and have hot keys for pet attack, pet follow and pet stay.  Then you can abuse those three commands to position your pet pretty much where ever you want.
---
Ok..what am i looking at?
---
Where would i ontain BiS gear for spriest if not from raiding?
---
I don't know but I think the guards tp is a thing from BFA.... Or it was in vanilla ? I don't really remember
---
You'll be playing a completely different game. While the enemies are stronger, the game is also much more simplified. You'll be fine.
---
Yup, shaman + warrior is the best duo
---
The system runs thousands of items of product an hour. 95% of the reported bugs or flaws in the automation come from people interfering with the automation system. 
---
When something "weird" happens and they report it and collect logs it's almost always because the user tried to do something manually why the automation system was also running.
---
priest or shaman complement warriors the best

Have you even played BfA?
---
I’m sure it will, it’s just a very different experience.
---
Glad I am not alone.
---
I'm fail to see why would a random roaming lvl 60 could add much to your leveling experience... Unless he is there to gank you, then its way worse.
---
You can also see it in action here https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ89cmRkM9V87MzAE87cMbx87kMbe808MbC808Mbt808Mbv87V
---
Short answer : yes.
---
Long answer: Every expansion has removed or made worse more features and content then they added.
---
That's why the more hardcore players do everything they can to get ahead of the pack as much as possible. The faster you are, the less competition you have. I remember a semi-recent pserver launch being an absolute slog because of the extremely high population, even with extremely fast dynamic respawns.
---
Of course they can, expansions with 6 raid tiers exist. No reason at all vanilla can't also have 6.
---
herbs like dreamfoil and such to make potions
---
BiS trinket
---
Lock/Shadow Priest is a top tier comp for leveling and for pvp. You'll enjoy yourselves.
---
It's very very tedious to write a long file without error highlighting. I suggest downloading a program called VS Code and even trying different JSON extensions for it to get syntax highlighting so you immediately see if you fatfinger something.
---
If the problem persists, download any of my route files and try importing them.
---
Even overwatch falls short of games like Halo IMO and Blizzard was definitely capable of doing more with it. They didn’t really create a world, just a series of re-skinned mini games. Overwatch would feel like a Blizzard game to me if they released it with some sort of map editor like WC3 or Halo had. It’s just really obvious that that Overwatch is kind of what was left over from their cancelled Titan project.
---
Pretty good way to weed out weak players.
---
No, it would be annoyingly restrictive. It's bad enough as it is: "For my character to mog a top hat onto something with actual stats, I have to run a zillion Island Expeditions and hope it drops, but if I'm a worgen I'm issued a statless Gilnean top hat, but ONLY if I'm a worgen? Even though anyone can buy a Gilnean outfit minus the hat from Darkmoon Faire?"
---
By your rules, to complete a tmog outfit you can get all but one piece of by level 10, you'd have to get the last piece at level 120. How does that even make sense?
---
Seeing as this is r/classicwow most of what you just said is irrelevant. Who cares which toon cleared it, it's the same person behind the keyboard. There is no facerolling old content when all we have is vanilla content.
---
Any guild that cares about being good will use Loot council, good players don’t get upset over loot, everyone gets geared eventually. Casual / family guilds will use DKP to minimize drama
---
We've all  been arguing about how layering will work, but it will actually just take all the gnomes and put them on their own layer.
---
You know what he means.
---
Obtaining BIS gear for spriests would have to be from raiding but it will be an uphill battle to get it.
---
You can get pretty good gear from rank 10 (after phase 3) and the rep from WSG, AV, and AB.  The 3 PvP factions can get you 4 or 5 epic pieces I think.
---
Although cool, I feel like most guilds that go this hard will just council instead.
---
If you make a shadow priest you’ll end up a holy priest or rerolling. The pressure and the denied raids will get to you.
---
Sort of, but there will be no reason to take on this kind of challenge on release. 
---
On pservers, with the content buffed, it still does give that Vanilla feeling of accomplishment but on Classic, same-level content will be a cakewalk for the average player in 2019.
---
I’ve been campaigning for a bit now for Classic to buff content similar to how pservers do which gives a healthy level of difficulty, but I get drowned out by nochanges.
---
I genuinly find classes more fun to play in classic than TBC (especially hunter which is my main). I recognize that's just my opinion and that the majority of people prefer the TBC design. Am i just trolling or objectively wrong in liking vanilla class design more?
---
Probably the reason Battle Royales aren’t fun for me, there’s no progression to it. You just queue up, win/lose, rinse and repeat until you’re bored.
---
Rank 1 Rockbiter tooltip says +34 Attack Power.
---
It gives me 58.
---
Fully specced Elemental Weapons give 20% boost to Rockbiter weapon attack power.
---
How much extra attack power do we get then?
---
34 Attack power / 5 = 6.8  Attack Power
---
So 20% equals 6.8 Attack Power.
---
100% = 34
---
120% = 40.8
---
58 - 40.8 = 17.2
---
I get 17.2 Extra Attack power from the scaling.
---
Edit: So actually, unspecced Rockbiter Rank 1 gives 29 Attack Power. 34 Attack power is WITH Elemental Weapons fully specced, which means There is 24 extra attack power from scaling.
---
What? A reason other than streamers are bad? Noooo, could not possibly be...
---
Yeah, I play classic beta and retail about equally. My realm is extremely active on retail and I’m never bored. On the other hand, I’m loving the slower RPG-feel of classic. 
---
Both have their place. Just because you don’t like BFA doesn’t mean it’s dead.
---
lmao!!! I don't know why but from the back, his language is screaming  ".....FUCK"
---
Noob
---
Classic good bfa bad
---
Yeah that is the biggest challenge Haha but people eventually get it if you show them how. Patience is a virtue, especially so in classic!
---
MoP is the favorite I see most often from players when it comes to class design, both for PvP and PvE. 
---
Also the only expansion I didn't play at all :(
---
iirc Expertise existed in Vanilla, it just wasn’t readily available. I believe two major sources were Humans (+5 to swords and maxes) and the Maladath weapon from BWL.
---
The point is you probably won’t because a lot of raids will only take 1 shadow priest.
---
Some classes are completely different.  There will be some relearning needed, but depending on the class, there could be a lot.
---
As a druid whos raided all content in vanilla I would highly advise that you focus on healing, and slowly build a set for feral tanking / balance pvp in your offtime or acquire it through raiding. Feral charge + swiftmend are fantastic tools and druids are definitely one of the most fun healers to play in the game.
---
just delete this whole sub once Classic is out, nothing of value lost
---
Still applies to the thousands of people who arent interested in this and dont come to reddit to talk aboutit.  Mmos are niche, classic even more niche
---
 For the majority of the people who want to play classic, it's all hype and curiosity that'll wear off quick because fact is, classic is a shit game. You play for the experience but it is a shit game and modern gamers by and large wont want to and dont have to play it.
---
It's easy to get lost in the reddit echo chamber and give each other pats on the back but dont forget that this isnt indicative of what will be considered success. Lots of players here sure but it's a drop in the bucket compared to retail and in the greater mmo audiences it's even smaller yet.
---
TL;dr for most people that statement is still true. They think they want it because nostalgia obscures the faults and especially now during bfa the grass looks greener. But it's almost certain most players who come gawking will quickly lose interest once the shine wears off. Classic fans are simply a vocal minority.
---
You're missing two things actually. 
---
One, classic is not being sold yet. 
---
Two, retail is being sold while people play on free, non-retail, servers and that's where the term originated.
---
Any further lessons won't be free, e-mail your paypal and I can discuss tutoring you further. :)
---
The biggest difference is you'll be using more CC.  Difficulty wise other than that they're maybe on par with mythic dungeons.  Of course over all classes are simpler so yeah it basically works out, if you can play retail you won't have a problem with classic.
---
I just tried this site and immeditely found my guildmaster from when I was like 14! I'm 28!
---
Fuckin awesome!
---
Yes that's why it's their RPG character.
---
A ton. It’s just not even remotely the same company. Everything they make now is a mini game compared to what their games used to be. Just look at what WC3 was. You bought it once, yet the game itself was so expansive that an entire genre of games was created inside of it. Incredible games like LoL wouldn’t exist without how ambitious Blizzard used to be.
---
&gt; I stand by it's a slippery slope.
---
This is ultimately the crux of it and really quite a valid issue. The community can be toxic at the best of times, opening this can of worms could be a catalyst for much more drama no matter how well intentioned. 
---
&gt;but it isn't game breaking.
---
Making normally accessible content inaccessible until restarted is by definition game breaking. 
---
I'm still not sold on the idea that we should actively be reintroducing incredibly fustrating, unintended elements into the game for nostalgia's stake. No-one having grouped for 90 minutes to get that far found the bug endearing. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions though and I'm sure the team will consider outlier elements like bugs carefully before making what they feel is the best choice. As long as classic is playable again I'll be happy either way.
---
Some of it is improved hardware, too. Vanilla raiding was tough when half the raid was getting 4 fps and would freeze for a 1-2 seconds every time the boss breathed fire.
---
We would tell healers to stand in a corner staring at a wall so that they could keep healing without "lag spikes". Not server lag but graphical client-side "lag". We had some people who had to /follow in Molten Core because otherwise they'd run into the lava if their computers dropped to 0 fps for a second or two.
---
Osrs *Cough* *Cough*
---
No I think I'll wait a couple months for Classic, which will be 1.12 and will not include transmog.
---
Which Sims are you playing next, summerchild?
---
Holy shit this sub is cancer. Every mongoloid on this sub spouts this dumb ass comment nearly every day. We get it.
---
That’s actually what I’m looking forward to. 
---
Current wow is so streamlined that patience is lost, as is the general helpfulness of the community. 
---
Just last night I was farming Obsidian Warbeads for the Kurenai Talbuk Mounts in Nagrand on my 120 Pally and I probably helped 3 people do the Ring of Blood simply because I was there and they asked. 
---
I feel like you don’t see as much of that anymore, but I’ve acted like that ever since I was given gold to buy my first mount in BC by some random stranger who noticed I hit level 40
---
Ok, where is the evidence that it was harder then?  You can't "attest" to shit when you aren't in the beta and you're basing your conclusion off of a recollection of Nostalrius.
---
The "I played on a private server and I know they are harder!" Isn't proof in any way shape or form.
---
Maybe they should give beta access to testers and not streamers only.
---
Yeah, yeah, we know you had to walk uphill 20 miles in the snow both ways to get to school in your day...
---
Shhh, I don't want more competition!
---
He's lying everyone! All the pservers are correct druids won't get into raids, don't roll one!
---
I think Jeff is really happy with the less demanding role of leading the OW team though. He kind of deserves to kick his feet up at this point.
---
The amount of people now vs then is going to be much greater.  MMOs werent a commonplace thing back then,  and it wasn't really even marketed much to my knowledge before release.
---
Explain me why and I'll tell you why you're wrong ;)
---
Male Dwarves and Orcs have that Spartan kick.
---
Um, close you eyes. Now open then to read this but metaphorically keep them closed so I can imagine this.
---
Imagine being one of the first people to sign in on the day of release. Imagine there is no layering. Keeping in mind the lengthy mob respawn time and the low % drop rate for quest items. Now imagine there are LITERALLY FUCKING THOUSANDS OF PLAYERS  also signed in trying to complete the same quest as you.
---
Quite a clever way of maintaining the nostalgia to the veterans but keeping the game playable. A nice compromise really.
---
&gt; It also brought arena which was the best PvP addition.
---
Arena is what made me quit PvP so I'm not really on board with that one.
---
A fraction of the players? You do understand everyone was just on 1 server right? On launch there will be many servers, so there will actually only be a small amount of players per starting zone.
---
This is exactly how I feel. It's crazy how over the last 10+ years through the expansions we're all like "hell yeah transmog! hell yeah dungeon finder! hell yeah flying mounts!" And then after awhile the world no longer feels like a world and we think back on these changes that ruined it. 
---
It was awesome going into a city and seeing all these super strong players with tier 2/2.5/3 or with legendary weapons. All of this ruined by transmog

1 week has 168 hours.

I am changing sleep schedule to 5-6 hours most likely tho. Sleep between 4 to 5 is little pushy.
---
Again I am talking about /played
---
I think you underestimate how much more threat Druids put out than Prot Warriors. It's significantly more. A few extra attacks from parry haste over the course of an entire boss fight is not even close to closing that gap.
---
What are some things i could do to stand out to be that shadow priest that DOES get the invite
---
didn't know gnomes had a fucking flash kick, that's pretty cool
---
still, troll male #1
---
I really hate the incredibly stupid notion that other players decide if I "deserve" to look the way I want to look. 
---
**IF YOU DON'T LIKE TRANSMOG, DON'T USE IT!**
---
You have no right to tell other people how they should enjoy the game. Or, as we used to tell whiners like you in EQ, you can tell me how to play the game when you pay my subscription.
---
No need to when I know what I’m saying is right. Maybe you should stop spreading misinformation that it isn’t linking realms.
---
I know, it was in "federal"
---
How about any fucking evidence that something is off?  This is just bullshit circlejerking by people not in the beta about how much harder private servers were when by every objective measurement that's been confirmed so far: they weren't.
---
You do realise this was a stress test with far, far more players than intended right..?
---
it will
---
and more players? Idk what this ideology is trying to accomplish he is right.
---
it's the break out plus immunity that is nasty.  Sure warriors and priest hate it because they blew a cooldown. However warlocks hate it too for that immunity timer,   and it blocks the succubus seduction as well.
---
For warlocks it means they might have to blow a death coil, but they know that going into the fight so they can work around that a bit.
---
Even today in current face roll "retail" WoW, I get a little nervous there.
---
It would be cool if Outland was reworked for classic as just a massive raid. 
---
Gear drops could be mainly for "Outland attunement" with maybe the last tier being better than classic t3. 
---
You could repeat that idea for every expansion to slowly add back content in a horizontal fashion. (That way you have Outland gear, Northrend gear, etc. While classic T3 gear could be a Jack of all trades gear set)
---
Yes you will, vanilla didn't have it's own launcher you just launched the game directly.
---
Those days are long gone, just like pretty much every other game company out there blizzard has it's own launcher, which handles login updates purchasing etc.... and you will be using it.
---
Sharding in BFA and layering in classic are two different things. Learn the difference if you want to call people delusional.
---
Lmao? He's been president less than a year. Don't be ignorant.
---
because they're trying to path up to him and since there is no correct pathing route, they teleport instead
---
Telling my fiance that I will be neglecting all adult responsibilities for the foreseeable future post launch. It's really allowed me to prepare my time to be as free as possible.
---
Good old AV grind, I remember the days where a game of AV could last 6-8 hours
---
I don't know which theorycrafters you're talking about but in the past year the talk has always been about how Druid tanks out-threat warriors and that the 10%~ or so increased damage taken is far outweighed by their threat potential.
---
I’ll tell you this, I’ve played vanilla all of retail vanilla, and since early 2016. I wanted to check out my account so I bought a sub for nostalgia to look at all my old chars for the first time in 12-13 years. I had no idea what to do, where my skills went, what talents had become etc. 
---
Completely different game.
---
Every zone is on youtube my dude. At least try. You aren’t going to find a guide for exploring to 10
---
They only invited a small number of people.
---
I guarantee you they fuck up the launch.
---
More parries = Less threat per second from the tank = Fury Warriors have to throttle their DPS even more when compared to private servers, due to their lack of threat reduction. That will effect balance.
---
Crushes and crits are only an issue if you're getting killed in 1 hit, which doesn't happen to Druids because of their massive EH. The only situation that this could possibly affect is if a Druid takes back-to-back crits with max parry haste, which would mean two crits 1.5 seconds apart. (Boss swings happen 2.5 seconds apart without any parry haste - 40% faster attack speed would drop that to 1.5 seconds assuming they parry immediately after attacking.)
---
That's definitely possible, but in a 40-man raid, if the healers are on their game, then more often than not you will get a heal in those 1.5 seconds and you won't die to back-to-back crits.
---
they are just testing the limits of their tech, e.g. how many people *CAN* (not WILL) be on one server/layer at a time, so that they can make the 
---
and furthermore there are ways to level that don't include killing mobs in the starting zone
---
I found the rep grind in TBC takes some of the shine off the expansion.  
---
As good as it was, I prefer Vanilla.
---
Implausible assertion not supported by evidence.
---
Who remembers doing the event before the nerf
---
If u think wotlk was shit youre a dumbass.
---
You also will have a difficult time ranking up because no good premade takes a shadow priest
---
Neither was the end of AQ40, but both of these raids were difficult less because of mechanics and more because of the metagaming hurdles of coordinating 40 people, farming excessively for raid buffs, dealing with rapid attrition, and working on far less advanced infrastructure both client- and server-side. A raid like the ones in retail could never have even been implemented in Vanilla simply because the technology didn't exist to support it. As I said, there were legitimately hard bosses in AQ40 and Naxx, but I still contend that the *mechanics* in Vanilla were all objectively more simple and easily mastered, in a vacuum, than something like Mythic retail raids. The simple fact was that, especially for Naxx, the players were fighting against time itself with the impending expansion that would make all their gear useless, and their computers were far less capable of handling the game than they would be today, so even if the mechanics were "easy", the raid was still insanely difficult and all but foreclosed to 99+% of the player base.
---
Layering could help if they used dynamic layering on launch day.  They have alluded to this, but who knows what they'll actually do.  Basically the way this would work is setting the player limit on a layer to something like 150 (\~25 players per starting zone) and have as many layers be opened as needed per server to support the initial surge.  After 30 minutes, increase the player limit per server to 300 and so subsequest players filter into the original layers. Keep increasing the player limit per layer as the day goes on.  Collapse layers as populations begin to spread out.  By day 2, have a small number of layers with original vanilla-like populations.
---
Max level shadow priests are for PVP, and your BiS gear is the PVP gear.
---
However I'll note that PVP premades also won't take shadow priests. They too expect priests to heal, so all your PVP will be solo queue or world PVP.
---
Shadow priests are a trap in vanilla. Looks cool, plays fun, is a deadend.
---
This is a healer's first real challenge in my opinion. I'll never forget my first time in ZF, wiping multiple times, and figuring out how to conserve my mana and still heal effectively.
---
RemindMe! 88 Days "Set class colors and camera view"
---
Holy shit a blizzard team that actually gives a shit. This is something we haven't' see in like a decade.
---
Like a world of Warcraft wears Waldo.
---
Expansions in WoW don't expand the game.
---
It just replaced current content with new expansion content. Which is why every expansion had a large amount of churn.  Every expansion was essentially a new game.
---
I think people remember Wrath fondly partly because of the zones.  Howling Fjord, Grizzly Hills, and Storm Peaks had some of the best ambiance and music in a game ever, IMO.
---
Sounds like most hunters I grouped with hahaha
---
I agree with this. We didn't have transmog in DAOC or early EQ (EQ1/2 has it now, with a way better mechanic than WoW uses), but in DAOC we at least had armor dyes. My alchemist made good money crafting and selling those.
---
You do know this is a circlejerk sub right
---
It honestly doesn't take long if the officers are on the ball.
---
I'm sure lists work fine, but I just don't see it being that popular in live.
---
Told my girlfriend she will be ignored for a few weekends.
---
I did the stress test, there were 4 people per mob spawn, I got the undead starting area done in about half an hour because I did this thing called communicating with people. Partied up with 5 other dudes and we slayed those quests together, 2 of them stuck around and killed level 9 shit with me for fun. I now have +2 bnet friends and I'm way less nervous about day 1 classic. 
---
Tldr: group up with people day 1 and you'll be fine.
---
Hey, guess what: if they had the layering tech in 2004, they would have used it. It's no longer 2004 and we know that server launches are a shitshow. Blizz is trying something new to alleviate that and people are calling it a game breaker while it's still being tested. 
---
I can't wait until a few weeks into launch when everybody's too busy playing the game to give a shit about this.
---
He's saying that private server elites hit harder, not that they're correct. Stop your hostile attitude.
---
Jontrons vid was during the nostalrius backlash, the "youthink you do" was seperate, during blizzcon 2016.
---
I love how you insult people who disagree with you before they even do. Jfc. Ppl on this sub need to grow the fuck up. Every one here says they played vanilla but act like they’re 13. Most 30+ year olds I know don’t act like entitled children
---
Honestly, everyone saying that Orc Stun resist is opopop is only partially true. For most classes yes, it's great. Enhancement Shaman, it's great as well. Something else to consider, the stun resist will not proc off of dynamite because those don't count as stuns, they could as incapacitates which, to my understanding, operate differently.
---
But what Shaman really lacks is HARD CC. Shaman have plenty of soft CC in the form of slows, but they have zero hard CC abilities in the form of fears, stuns, charms, etc. This is why Tauren make great shaman, because even if it is on a 2 minute cooldown (which really isn't that long) they are the only shaman race that has access to some hard CC.
---
It's such a dilemma for me as well because Troll are so obviously the best race, and tauren are a close second for me. But damn if it isn't a tough call.
---
Please don’t play Classic. Thanks!
---
Let me guess, you were in public accounting before and then switched to industry?
---
The people replying to you have no idea what they're talking about. I just did this boss on the stress test and the boss does indeed kill the tank in 3 hits. The healer does go oom after 3 heals. But you can snare the boss and kite him forever, which is how you kill it. It has nothing to do with pservers being overtuned
---
Why do I have a strong feeling this will be another OSRS and that excites me even more
---
Right, but what I'm trying to say is I've already seen it, I was fairly certain it was posted on here but I couldn't remember the title.
---
Either way, every zone is on youtube. Thanks for the help.
---
Just have one person go tailoring. You can pretty much create all the gear you’d ever need until 60. Shadoweave gear, dream weave gear and fel cloth gear will get you where you need before you start farming pre raid gear. I highly suggest looking into those pieces on a vanilla wow database to see all those gear pieces.
---
What a random and interesting thought. Wonder what percentage of people play humans in mmo's vs other races.
---
Just wrap your tower in tin foil, it keeps bad men from utilizing chem-trails to analyze your data.
---
Bookmarked, DON'T delete dis neffew
---
&gt; I think in 2-3 years time classic will dominate retail and become the new norm.
---
Eh. Unless they are making new content, classic won't be super successful forever. I cannot believe that more than a (sizeable) niche of players would play the limited amounts of content for years to come.
---
Tons of people will try it out, many will decide it's not for them, another chunk of people won't get to 60 before quitting (just like in the old days), some will quit at some point after 60, some will finish all PvE content and some will just play it forever until they have all chars in full T3. But how many people do you think will actually stick around after that?
---
We can hope for it to be successful enough for them to add new content but honestly? I don't see it happening. Not saying I wouldn't like to but really? You think they will curate 2 versions of WoW?
---
I'd be interesting in partial scaling, depending on character history.  Like if I've never killed a Naga before it should be hard for a little while.
---
He got promoted.  He is fine
---
I remember seeing shadow priests running around in shadowform with anathema and being like wowwww i wanna do that...
---
Im gonna give it a shot maybe ill get lucky and be the 1 that gets the invite.
---
[Loot lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/) is the most hardcore system. No drama, no time wasted, anyone in the raid could decide loot because it's all public. Distributing gear takes 5 minutes after a raid, thanks Blizzard for loot sharing!
---
You do realize that stress tests are done so Blizzard can fill one realm with as many people as possible, right?
---
1. Realms will have a pop limit which the stress test doesn't have (or if it have one it's extremely large).
---
2. Layering on launch, Blizzard has already said that they will use layering at a much larger scale to thin out the herd. So you might play with 200 people or something in the starting area rather than 500+.
---
Again, this is a stress test. It's not made for you to have a rather decent leveling experience. It's made for Blizzard to stress test their servers and find potential bugs with their new layering system.
---
How is it a logical fallacy if it *actually happened to the exact game we are talking about*?
---
There is no error in reasoning here.
---
I never ever, got both the drops to make that sword. It haunts me to this day, but I never tired of this dungeon. I don't know what it is exactly but it's in my top 5.
---
Is that true? What is the effect classified as? I assumed it was a stun or slerp
---
I mean there is supposed to be dynamic respawns in the starting zones as per that vanilla dev a while back isn't there.     
---
But I doubt they'd have that many people in the zones for launch but iunno
---
You can bait out those interupts as any class with a hearthstone.
---
The animation is different than a heal for every class, but in the heat of a fight no one is going to notice that.
---
Can priests dispel it. Is it considered a magic effect?
---
What changes is the amount of DPS done. Either less threat to a lower cap or normal threat to a higher cap achieves the same goal.
---
Sure, threat is easier to manage as Alliance, but like you said thats obviously not the whole picture. Windfury the tank is definitely more dangerous with the confirmed hit table mechanics, but the fact that the hits not only generate threat themselves, but rage (and yeah, I know tanks dont tend to be rage starved) which then is spent on more threat.
---
Its not the whole picture or a perfect solution, but its no small tool. Alliance got a more Boss Firsts, but Horde got almost every full clear. That doesn't speak to me as indicative of a massive unfair overall Alliance advantage. And no, I don't buy into "Well Horde players are just smarter better people obviously". I'm sorry if I'm reading more into tone than you intended though. I think we're on the same side of the argument, just different angles
---
Always the most clueless people shouting the loudest lol
---
Ty for some clarity. People sound so stupid with the whole "streamer only beta" thing. It's like flat earth logic, it doesnt even make sense.
---
They cashed in all the remaining “cool” in the franchise bringing Illidan back and giving everyone Ashbringer and welfare legendaries but the core systems were all derived from Diablo 3. Lots of people enjoyed it until they couldn’t get the legendary they needed to drop and realized the game revolved around grinding artifact power in greater rifts. Lots of the dislike for BFA is people waking up to the realities of the systems that got added during Legion that they were too distracted to notice.
---
I always found undead (insert class here) more intimidating than any other race as an alliance player.
---
Take away layering and this whole sub would be having a fit day1 when they’re in a que of 200k people.

I quit Wotlk once I went to college so I can't comment on the 2nd half of it's life but I would say 1st half Wotlk = BC and both better than Vanilla. Vanilla got super boring unless you were raiding in a decent guild. There was a reason why MC was called Molten Chore. Most classes were limited in their specs and rotations.
---
BC was great for pvpers with the addition of arenas. The raids and dungeons were great (although I wasn't a huge raider at the time).
---
Wotlk improved a lot on class design. I played disc priest in raids and pvp and it honestly felt so natural and fun. Raids were fun and slightly more accessible. Community aspect was still there. I heard the 2nd half was bad but the time I played it, it was great.
---
I would classify current BfA hotkey abilities as a whack-a-mole game - when the button lights up - smash it. Or when the light on that thing goes out then smash that other button. High tier Mythic+ is certainly hard in that it requires each player to understand the boss abilities, their counters, and the Mythic affixes present.
---
Vanilla/Classic dungeons are less about getting your timing perfect, though it is still important, and much more about communication and managing encounters and pulls. Most of the time you'll be spamming 1 or 2 abilities. Dungeons also take much longer than BfA. You have to commit to the run. A Sunken Temple run can easily stretch to 2 hours.
---
The TL; DR is almost as long as long as your paragraphs in your main points.

I stopped masturbating

You got me right there, sir.

Haha this was one of my favorites!!

---
14/13/24 hybrid spec. Good enough to raid, enough shadow talent to melt faces.
---
Optimal? No
---
Viable for pve healing and pvp dps? Totally. 
---
Just not for tryhard guilds. Most casual guilds will gladly take you as a healer.
---
Get a job so I could me afford a subscription and internet.
---
If the rumours are true that it was originally meant to be a 40 man raid then Blizz might still have that data somewhere unless it all got scrapped after the TBC version was made/converted. 
---
I've also heard that parts of outland were supposed to be availible at level 60. Would have been cool to have had a Kara raid and  world event leading to the portal opening prior to TBC release.
---
@topic, YES.
---
It's just like the natural Order. Vanilla &gt; TBC &gt;&gt;&gt; Wrath.
---
TBC did a lot of neat things for balance especially to hybrid classes, introduced a fairly cool new World, fantastic Raids and Dungeons but also took the first Steps into the wrong direction by introducing Arena and sperating PvP and PvE Gear with the horrible crit resistance perk, making BGs essentially worthless, aswell as wpvp and of course flying. (Admittedly it was the best state of flying in WoW but still horrible).
---
Wrath is just (fucking horrible) bad and only kept in good memory because it was the peak of WoW Playerbase. 1k Winter was neat. Oh and Ulduar, which was actually peak raid design. 
---
So yeah, TBC and Wrath had good things but compared to vanilla, the good things weren't the majority.
---
I only played during TBC mainly because i just enjoyed the PvP and not so much the PvE aspect of WoW but during that time i think PvP was at its highest.
---
So many memorable videos on Warcraftmovies, everything was somewhat viable even though it wasnt perfectly balanced (god damn Restoration Druids were op and annoying).
---
The fights were extremely strategical and even open world pvp was still existing everywhere. The arenas were not as stupid as the shit they introduced in wraith as well (removin pillars so you couldnt LoS anymore...same for the new battleground, who enjoys shooting doors with catapults...).
---
The only thing i enjoyed far more in Wraith as a warlock was people could play more than just sl/sl, because as a warlock nothing else was even remotely viable in TBC and the only viable playstyle was being a punching bag.
---
Everything else though was the most fun i ever had in WoW (i quit immediatly in Wraith when i recognized they dont understand what was fun about PvP in TBC).
---
Dual wield tanking you mean? Agreed, but I'm not surprised that it will be worse in Classic. Dual-wield DK tanks were a questionable choice in WotLK thanks to parry haste - they weren't terrible, but they weren't the best option either. 
---
WotLK DKs didn't have to sacrifice any mitigation to dual wield. They couldn't use shields in the first place. But Warriors on private servers are giving up basically half of their armor and the ability to block without any consequences? That didn't pass the smell test to me.
---
IT USED to be in during one of the original alphas/betas back before 2004. I know the files are still in the original game. It's simply not obtainable.
---
Um, you don't understand what an RPG is. RPGs are fashion over function--immersion, *roleplaying game*.  MOBAs, strategy wargames, and minatures wargaming are "function over fashion".
---
(And miniatures gamers still put a lot of effort into painting their figures...)
---
Haha yeah shoving piles of money at them and inflating their stock options will for sure teach those damn execs a lesson !
---
I think if you took the classes as they were in TBC and placed them in Classic, then tuned up the existing raids to be a little bit more complicated you'd have a pretty flawless game.
---
I still don’t understand layering. I played on a private server blizzlike vanilla and experienced launches with over 10k people starting out. We all made it in the end, just have to be creative at times. I just don’t get how they were able to handle that much population and blizzard can’t.
---
Because you unironically put smilies on every response like a dipshit.
---
This was just one server.
---
Hmm interesting. Does that unlock shadowform or no
---
Weird i made it to level 6 in 30 minutes via grouping.. all quests done too.
---
People go nuts just because they have to wait a few seconds in between mobkills.
---
How hard can it be to endure these first 30 minutes ? Like come on. This stuff you talk is what brought is retail wow. 
---
People just login and see its hard to get a mob.. then they quit and hope complaining fixes it. 
---
I even felt it in the stress test.. like after 15 minutes the starting zones were less then half as dense populated because ppl whine and quit.
---
Thats not why were getting/wanting classic to repeat the same shit again. If you want WoW where everything is EZ and you dont have issues leveling and getting gear..well play BFA then.
---
Also iam not a no changes guy.. but this is a stupid request which will only bother you for maybe 30 minutes if you dont cry and quit.
---
Hell let it be 2 hours or so..
---
You know what i got after 2 hours in dark age of camelot ? Nothing
---
&gt; TBC has somewhat related raids, but even with Illidan being on the cover he wasnt the final raid, and it wasnt all about him.
---
What if I told you Illidan doesn't actually appear on the cover of TBC?  (It's a draenei and a blood elf)
---
They didn't start putting the boss on the cover till Wrath and Illidan got to be on the Legion cover.
---
&gt;However TBC is probably the best expac, and would be superior to Classic, if they made flying less OP.
---
I mean this is sort of a problem with xpacs in general but I think TBC broke the leveling experience.  It made so much content obsolete basically any 50+ dungeon was pointless when you were going to get all those OP greens when you got to Outland.
---
And that's the other thing it's not as bad as it is today but having EVERY quest gear your character out in quest greens hurt the gear scarcity vanilla had going for it.  It wasn't as prominent in TBC as it became in Cata but it was the start of the death of needing to group for gear.
---
So how is someone supposed to know the difference between bullshit, and actual information if you are too lazy to defend yourself with evidence, eh?
---
If you make a claim that is counter to how blue posts say something is supposed to work, bring your evidence, otherwise to a casual reader your post is no different than people saying transmog and the microtransaction store are going to be in classic.
---
Edit - also you should tell blue posters to stop spreading the misinformation - because that's where I'm getting it.
---
Oh I see! Than makes sense... Thanks!
---
Divorcing my wife and putting my kids up for adoption.
---
Nope. You can go 0/20/31 for shadowform tho. Its still pretty good too
---
I'm a third world loser and I've never worked in my life, I'll be turning 22 at the end of the year, I really wanted to fix my life once for all, but classic is something that will happen once in a lifetime and it's so tempting, so it's going to be my last game.
---
Nifty Stopwatch from the Badlands!
---
I am very excited, specially no transmogs. I’m so happy we are going back to the days where everyone knew how badass you were based on your gear.
---
Rp PvP servers had some of the best world PvP events I've ever played. We used have 3-4 guilds show up at places like the bridge to wetlands and fight over it.
---
Well that 50% you just mentioned just isn't true. Every specc has it's place, but you have to choose. Wanna go PvP? Well specc for it. Farming ? PvE? You know the drill. Vanilla just forces commitment to a certain thing and you can' just go with dual specc or a "one for all" build.

Not at all, Dungeon Sets (T0) have pretty useless stats and bonuses. Almost all have Spirit and just main stats but no +spellpower/+healpower/+crit/+hit/+def .

Look at this list as an example:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#)
---
I think TBC had such a strong foundational PVE scene along with ranked play that people kind of didn't care about the world PvP scene as much as vanilla. TBC is my absolute favourite rendition of wow but I fully respect and acknowledge it jumped the shark (flying, community dynamic).
---
Oh dear. Are you telling me that in classic PvP, gear matters more than player competence? That doesn't sound like fun.
---
The poison bats are a great calm farming spot for shamans due to the toxic slowing poison that no one wants to mess with who can’t remove poisons.

Dota auto chess
---
I’m looking forward to this kind of adventures.
---
gotta say, that is an odd top 3, but hey I guess it's cool that people like so many different vanilla dungeons
---
&gt;Raids drop so few items that outside of tiers they are last to get gear. 
---
Except for ele Shamans. There's a surprising amount of mail spell damage gear in MC, BWL, ZG &amp; AQ40 thats designed specifically for Ele shamans.
---
Also think it shines because its sandwich between God awful expansions.
---
I'm not downvoting because I'm a #nochange moron, but because you seem to be a #nobrains moron. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL @ judging a stress test playerload
---
Oh so we have transmog and crossrealm and lfg tech now, we should use it in classic? No.
---
It was bad enough even with layering. Last night everything in Elwyn was dead. And I mean everything, kobolds, wolves, bandits, spiders, sheep, cows, deer, rabbits. Everything.
---
It really is, it’s pretty sad.
---
A fury warrior with a healer can 2 man 3 bosses from dme. There is good money from just vendoring the high level blues but if one is an enchanter you can DE any gear that vendors for less than large brills sell for. Bonus if you have a miner because 2 rich thorium nodes spawn in the cave after the last boss. It might not be super profitable if you dont have some decent gear but once the fury is geared it can be over 75g an hour.
---
Grew to love that part eventually. Continued to run it solo when I was 60!
---
&gt;Talking about /played  In which case, the amount of hours that some of us will put in initially, is basically the same thing.
---
4 days /played and 4 actual days is "basically" the same thing to you though. That's what I am commenting on.
---
Yep. She started out at a concrete place, then took a position as staff accountant at Robert Orr Sysco. Now she's the compliance manager for the branch and they've told her to prepare to be CFO in the next 5 years. She's 29.
---
The other 3 started at KPMG(2 of them) and BDO(1). The KPMG two hated it, went to BDO. They both left within a year and are now out of public. The girl who started at BDO is still there....4 years or so later. She's kind of a masochist though.
---
I can't even come back with an alt at level and get it, so I resent the hell out of all the cool artifact appearances I never had a chance to get (especially since none of my alts get to enjoy artifact traits, either, they just get to slog through Legion hoping to get some relics for incremental iLevel upgrades). Screw time-limited challenge appearances until Blizz puts them in time-walking.
---
Idk. It sucks and is annoying but a lot of classic isn't gameplay it's story's we make along the way.  
---
Having this bug happen is a story. it's not a happy one but its an experience. I'm sure when it happens and someone tells/asks their guild what's going on its going to be that "classic experience".
---
Also I'm 90% it happened when only you talked to the human to start the fight at the sameish time as the goblin. So that's more community involvement  ( what id argue is the base of classic wow ) taken away because of something that is annoying not game breaking.
---
 I don't think they should go out of their way to add it back or remove it. If it's there leave it be as that is classic. If it's not I wouldn't mind it being gone
---
Slaming PUBG?
---
 RemindMe! 88 Days
---
Exactly. the #nochanges people are selfish as hell.
---
Wow. Was the Alliance faction more populated in the stress test than the Horde?
---
Yes, it is a magic effect. Priests and Felhunters can remove it. Self-damage removes it, too, of course. Same deal with Polymorph. Which is why the [Skull of Impending Doom](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom) is an important PvP item.
---
I wasn't ready to see this
---
That sounds like a bug. I couldn't skin rabbits in vanilla. Only deer and real mobs.
---
Fuck Gnomer!
---
You're pretty stuck in the past. If anything it'll hurt warriors more than druids because warriors get more hits out between global cooldowns and weapon speed. You're also coming at it as if it's only druids and fury warriors that'll be getting parried more. Prot warriors will too. All tanks will take more damage, and the percentage of damage taken relative to each other tanking style will be the same.
---
Also tanks don't die to one spike of parry haste or even two crits in a row. 
---
Defense is overhyped despite being a good stat, it's not necessary to reach any caps.
---
Give it a go and join some of the theorycrafting communities instead of spouting continuous misinformation.
---
Because it's attributing the result of 100 different small steps to a single early step.
---
You're forgetting a few concepts I believe to be equally damaging:
---
* Paid realm transfers
---
* Name and race changes
---
* Cash shop
---
* Sharding
---
* Lack of class identity
---
No on really knows the proc chance. It could be good, or it could be garbage; it could also be meh.
---
i was really looking forward to seeing the results, thanks a bunch!

Decided to nolife in the beginning of 2019  to make sure I had no friends when classic was about to launch. That way I avoid phone calls and surprices. 
---
I will spent august 20-26 with my GF nonstop to make sure she had enough alone time with me prelaunch. Also that way she might want a lot of alone time herself. 
---
Also going to cook tons of food august 26 and move the microwave near my computer.
---
best way it to piss off the bulk of your guild, to create a real world, nepotism? Oh, I let the gm bum hump me, so I get Benediction first. Yay!
---
If it gets boring, why then play the game?
---
Boosting players even if they are alts makes the acomplishment of others look bleak.
---
First to level 60
---
Btw deep disc tree is also a viable pvp dps tree with good gear. Aka Smite Spec. It scale well with spell power. You become a holy mage that can heal.
---
Yeah. Bc wins due arenas and generally more obtainable loot.
---
This is the classic sub.
---
yeah. BRD is cool and all for its size/scope/etc. but I think I would enjoy it a lot more if it wasn't that same feel over and over. A similarly long/ambitious dungeon with a different setting would have been better. Still a really good dungeon though.
---
yusssssssss! i hope every just joins classic :)
---
It really depends on you and your plans.
---
Me personally I like to take a week, grab some quests that I know are gear upgrades and farm some cash, before starting anything else.
---
If you can grind for gold as is go ahead and do that. for a bit to stock pile some cash.
---
If not then start farming dungeons and quests for pre-BiS gear.
---
If your going PvP battle grounds, I'd recommend you do several immediately.  A gear shortage can really magnify any problems in your playstyle, and make it dramatically easy to see when you mess up.  Where as fully geared out, you can often mess up quite a bit, and still think your pretty good, and won't see the problems until after your playstyle has already turned into instinct and very difficult to change.
---
This is so true.
---
Back in vanilla, I got into what seemed like a "hardcore" guild. I was basically told to reroll to a priest and it had to be a dwarf priest or I could gtfo. Guess what I did lol, I found somewhere else to use my mage. 
---
Just play what you have fun with, there will be room for you somewhere, regardless of race and class.
---
&gt;  I played Vanilla 
---
&gt; my son (16)
---
Did you ding 60 or your wife up first?
---
I did this run SO many times for that INT Troll/Voodoo Mask to drop.
---
They won't be competing with fury/rogue even with these changes. They'll see a small DPS increase on horde side in particular, as alliance have salvation blessing, but they just do not scale as well with gear like the other classes do. Plus they still get forced in to staying MM for trueshot aura, despite survival providing much higher DPS once you're in late aq40/naxx gear due to the 15% agility talent.
---
If no one heard about it - really good league because they finally fix melee/movement abilities.
---
That classic wow hype will get you every time 😂
---
I don't have first hand experience, but I've heard that if you are an excellent player and put in 10x the effort required for good classes, you can just barely edge into the viable range. In other words, the 0.01% who can dedicate themselves fully can achieve mediocre results. Still dogshit though.
---
There is one tracked blue post last night that you can see on wowhead that is a game-changer for raids. In private servers a level 63 boss had the same 5% chance to parry and dodge. It was being reported as a bug that enemys were parrying at 14%. The blue posts stated this was not a bug. It was indeed 14%. This means a chunk of threat for the tank won’t be there.
---
VOA loot pinata. 
---
All in on dailies.
---
Yeah and I’m sure he’s had zero say on the direction of the game before he became president. /s
---
Talk about ignorance man 😂
---
Warrior, as was my first to 60 in vanilla and still the character I identify most with as "me" in the game.
---
my man! thx you.
---
Yeah and all the boomers should kill off the zoomers cause they been alive longer.
---
This guy doesn’t want to heal though and everyone is recommending shaman which isn’t a dps class if you plan on raiding, so if you really don’t want to heal then shaman isn’t a good choice for you. Leveling it can work but once you’re at end game you most likely won’t be able to be a dps spec so keep that in mind. If you’re fine with that, then 1000% go shaman as wind fury totem is a warriors best friend and you’ll increase his dps by a lot by just dropping a totem. 
---
If u absolutely don’t want to heal, I would go with mage as you can create food, have great CC abilities, great at farming gold, and can port to any main city on command which helps a lot.
---
This is what I like. Its loot counsel with all the counseling done before hand. And no feel-badsies. You know where you stand before you go in. You see that t1 helm drop, you don't expect to get it on some hope that maybe you polished enough knobs or covered your tongue in enough brown eye to maybe get one. You know you don't, and you choose to sit or not, and earn reputation with your guild by going any way.
---
Can you spot any non-human?
---
I have a time machine that lets you move forward in time at a 1:1 rate if it'll help!
---
So you’re saying bad tanks exist. Cool, you’re right.
---
I dont think they're underestimating at all. In fact the layering system is precisely because they expect a huge wave at first. Logically most current wow players will probably try classic on release since it's free to them anyway. That's a huge wave of people. And realistically very few of those will stick around for long. So they have to balance a huge wave of people at first while maintaining populated servers after people start dropping off. Really classics only going to have a couple hundred thousand  core players but initially they might get 10x that number.
---
Thanks everyone. Is it me or is August 27th still too far away? :(
---
Every other game feels empty.
---
I will be playing 18 hours a day. The differentiation is small as you are putting avg overtime of days work in. Hence "basically".
---
IRL we looking at week of played, ingame played is 4 to 6 days. Rest my case, see you in 3 months 😉
---
Are you trolling, or just stupid? 
---
During the time when MC/BWL/Ony raids were the endgame content there were no 16 debuff slots, no buffed itemization (huge difference btw), and no buffed 1.12 talents. 
---
You might agree that blizzard made a good design choice here, but don't moronically say this is BLIZZLIKE &amp; #NOCHANGES. 
---
ROFL, it's not blizzlike even in the slightest.
---
It's EZMODE LookingForRaid level difficulty by comparison.
---
It was never an "amazing weapon" in Vanilla. It was only used for lul shenanigans in PvP to sometimes get huge burst swings, like you said. But that doesn't mean it was actually good as a main weapon. The best use of it outside of PvP lulziness was as a weapon swap for conditional attacks like Execute, to activate after you got the FoF buff. No doubt a fun thing to farm for, but I suspect a lot of people will be caught off-guard by its mediocre quality after either rose-colored Vanilla memories or inaccurate experience from pserver Ironfoes, which notoriously proc a *lot* more than they ever feasibly did in Vanilla.
---
And the drop rate was 2%. Don't believe that was ever changed.
---
Edit: I sorta take back what I said. It was "BiS" for Prot Paladins in PvE, simply because Prot Paladin single threat generation was kinda meh, and Ironfoe helped with that. So if you were looking to tank 5-mans as a Paladin offspec, then it's good for that.
---
Yeah i totally understand what you're staying trolls are just do damm cool especially as shamans!
---
This is why RS3 is still going strong. It has significantly less players but the microtransactions make it financially as strong as OSRS. That's what the companies look at, not how many players, not how consistent the game is, but how much dough it's taking in at the time.
---
Non-fallacious forms of the slippery slope argument exist, and this is one of them. Because it happened already this exact way.
---
He isn't attributing 100 different small steps to a single early step. He's saying that it has (and it did, historically) have an impact on things becoming more casually in the form of "one thing here, one thing there - oops it's a casual game that caters simplicity over engagement".
---
Not that x leads to y leads to z.
---
surprised you have cata all the way down there, even tho it did some questionable pve stuff, a lot of pvpers have it as the best pvp expansion
---
lol! Only reason I knew that, is because I am a 2nd year associate at a CPA firm as well. Not as big as the big 4 but I totally get it. I am probably going to do one more year and get some more audit exp and then go into industry. I am not even going to bother with CPA exam. I should but I don't have the will power to put in 400 hours of studying especially now that Classic WoW is launching. lol
---
Vanilla and TBC are interchangeably first/second place depending on your style of play. Wrath is a distant 3rd.
---
Thing solves minor problem that players have happily ignored during the release of similar products. 
---
Problem is drastically overblown and exaggerated by potential playerbase that hasn't experienced the release of those similar products before.
---
Thing has drastic negative impacts on the end product. Some negative impacts can be fixed, but many cannot.
---
Give up on thing because the downsides vastly outweigh the upsides.
---
The dwarves are too drunk to fuck the gnomes.
---
Is it a paper bag you put over your head?
---
&gt; You think they will curate 2 versions of WoW?
---
Honestly, they’ve turned Retail into a playground where they hyper rework large game mechanic systems pretty much every expansion. Classes get added or reworked, new spells added, then spells removed; entire convoluted systems like Artifacts and Azerite are added, and then tossed by the wayside. They’ve practically been curating multiple versions of WoW for their last several expansions.  
---
I expect a development cycle like that would be extremely unwelcome in the Classic community- if that proves to be the case, then I can very easily see them instead exploring an alternate timeline and focusing on adding more mid-expansion content like raids or quest hubs. 
---
Having said that, it’s all speculation at this point. We’ll see when we get there
---
There is no counseling, it's just all the preference of players matched up ahead of time with a tiny reward for attendance.
---
Yep. Sadly, people seem to think it's BLIZZLIKE &amp; #NOCHANGES....
---
It's neither of the two. So why not adjust boss stats to make the end result blizzlike? It would be a round-about-way of making the game experience MORE blizzlike than it currently is.
---
Hell, DM does not even allow reckless pulls. The Goblin Foundry haunts me to this day.
---
Keep in mind this is under stress test conditions and servers will be no where near the same density on release.
---
I don't know if I'm *excited* for no transmog because it means i'll have to look like a dumpster clown.
---
Gnome get the 5% boost to intellect and a pretty good escape mechanic
---
Human gets the rep and spirit bonus. which the rep is a good  bonus. 
---
I’m going Gnome mage. 
---
I think the int bonus and the escape mechanic are better than the rep in my opinion.
---
Doesn't work the same in classic as itemization was completely different.
---
Yes items had itemlevel, but the stat budgets were..wonky. And the extra effects and such, they hadn't really figured out the cost item budget wise for them and unlike later on, you didn't get stamina for free.
---
Loot lists and loot council is usually what I prefer.
---
I was very generous to the guild bank with potions so it helped me gear fast on my hunter.
---
No, there are items that are even BiS until Tier 2.
---
For instance this chest piece for Priest that needs 300 Tailoring, recipe drops in Stratholme. https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18456/truefaith-vestments
---
Only a complete moron would think that way. No suprise here. You god damn imbeciles know why it got the highest sub count and went downhill from there? Because Vanilla and TBC did build that rep. Classic confusion of cause and effect. Get out of my sight.
---
Wsg wasnt out yet
---
You might think that but the vast majority do not agree with you.  The overwhelming consensus with Cata was that the Raiding was overtuned and people quit because of it.  Cata saw the largest drop off in the player base in the game's history.
---
16 Debuff slots = changes
---
Buffed raid itemization for earlier raids = changes
---
Buffed 1.12 class talents = changes
---
This community is a bunch of hypocrites.
---
What blue post said there is not issues with layering or sharding?
---
Edit: cause I stated that’s how we hope it works but not how it’s working.
---
I honestly think a lot of people are going to try it and only a few will stick around for the long term. Plenty of people have started playing post-classic and think the modern game *is* WoW. They're not going to stick around taking weeks to level through the Barrens.
---
Spend some time outside while you still can.
---
Pushing F5 on this subs newposts thread has been my go to. It isn't helping very much though
---
"slavishly beholden to" Nah man, you're really downplaying blizzard in that relationship.
---
Theres not much left to like.... mounts at least feel like an item you can try to get. Where as gear feels like playing a slot machine. 
---
But I get what you mean about the themes
---
I rolled as an orc warrior and saw like 50 people....clearly everyone was at Stormwind.
---
I can speak for private server leveling as I recently leveled a 60 dwarf priest on a current private server**. 
---
Healing wasn’t an issue in any form whatsoever at low level while 100% shadow talents. And granted Spirit Tap makes leveling a joke... I had literally zero downtime attacking provided I just didn’t try and dump all my mana instantly. 
---
Holy Nova is also very expensive to cast. Not looking to deplete my mana every pull if I get 2 mobs.
---
Seconded this. Also heirlooms made up for certain items that quests are weirdly reluctant to hand out with any frequency. Are you a dagger-wielding rogue spec? Good luck getting quests to cough up *two* daggers often enough to keep you equipped at anything near decent for your level, and I'm talking level-appropriate greens, not blue+ gear. And rogue is a DPS class that really depends on having good weapons. Heirlooms saved my rogue from being abandoned as a terrible solo class.
---
Also having shoulders and a headpiece useable at level 1 is kind of nice. It always weirded me out that WoW thinks basic pieces of your armor set shouldn't be available until 20-40 levels into the game.
---
Ooh yeah maybe that could be done with resistance gear
---
Saw this and it reminded me of this post.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_poverty_rate
---
I've tried to enable the classic theme or whatever but it looks nothing like thottbot. I will say that looking up quests by zone is easier on WoWHead as is, but that's the only thing I've found that I actually prefer, or like at all, over the other sites mentioned. There's just too much in your face crap on WoWHead, frustrating just to look at it.
---
Not trying to attack, just offer my humble, non webdev criticism.
---
Well it seems like you're just flat out wrong.  Immolate?  You put curse of the elements and sat there in your frozen shadoweave or w/e set and spammed shadowbolt.  Didn't even generate all that much threat.  Soul fire or w/e was the threat generator later on in the expansion.
---
I recently resubbed too, nearly broke my heart when I saw those lvl 1 motorcycles.
---
I would be very sad if they released the servers in their current state. Large city raids and world events are what makes the game great, and if we are gonna get layered/lagged out during these events then that would kinda ruin the experience.
---
People always underestimate those minor speed increases. 
---
Certain classes have talents that increase their passive movement speed and although for most it isn't much it really pays off.
---
Its like when you save a small amount of money a day. Sure its a tiny amount at first but after an extensive amount of time that little bit turns into so much.
---
Same thing with the speed boosts. Considering you run everywhere, when it comes to long distance it means alot.
---
I mean its all personal. I didn't play a ton in Cata or have a lot of great memories, Cata is when I took a big break from WoW. Maybe if I got really deep into it and played a lot it would be higher.
---
“Wtf, this boss mob that’s higher lvl than me is parrying as if it’s higher lvl than me”
---
lel
---
*officers gear up the reliable raiders - which are usually the officers and core raiders.
---
The goal of loot council is (usually) for every upgrade to have the biggest impact on next weeks raid. Usually that means giving bis items to players that are sure to show up 90% of the time.
---
The flip side that seems to get swept under the rug is most players in a LC guild will end up getting more loot than if they had to spend dkp or something on it. Usable upgrades are never sharded.
---
I don’t think every server will crash, but some will definitely die within the first 10 minutes. I’d imagine any server that a streamer rolls on will the RIP.
---
It's 'pack'
---
Oh I see, so once classic is released then it will also become a "retail" service , so I was assessing correctly then, thank you for agreeing with me o scholar of the english language :)
---
layering is implemented to avoid the problem of fighting 300 other people for the first month of the game for quest mobs (all players will only really be playing in 7-8 of the 40 zones. 
---
the layering solution is there to -hopefully- alleviate the need to merge servers in the future, and to avoid needing to create 10 additional servers to host the playerload (most of which will inevitably quit before the first few months, leading to servers with an extremly low population)
---
think about it for a second, what does blizzard have to gain by implementing this technology exactly? do you think they're creating this solution to save money? to make people not want to play classic? to enable people who want to 'abuse' a system? none of those make sense in this context. people (and businesses) are driven by motivation. they're wanting this launch to go smoothly so they can re-capture a large part of the market they've lost over the years and to re-establish positive relationships with non-casual gamers. 
---
just think dude.
---
edit: what's the absolute worst case scenario? you end up on a server that has permanent layers (blizz has outright stated that layering will be disabled when the server population has time to spread out to more zones by the way) and you have to invite your friends to see them. this would suck, but i dont think it would be the end of the world. 
---
what's the best case scenario? you get a smoother leveling experience, are able to actually login to the servers whenever you want (no queue time) and, by the time you hit 60, there is no more layering, just one server (i.e. how classic wow worked).
---
applying a comparison of risk vs reward here, i think i'll go with layering. i played classic from day 1, i really want to play this game again, but i'll avoid the queue times and spending an hour on a quest that would take me 10 minutes if there wasn't 100 other ppl fighting for quest drops.
---
Or worse, he does and he thinks it should be that way cause that's how it was back then too
---
Vanilla was great but it had some odd class balance choices
---
Tbc had great raids and made all the specs mostly playable.
---
Wotlk had terrible raids but a great story and an ending to the story that brought a lot of people in to the warcraft universe 
---
Tbc is provably my favorite with vanilla being a close second. Vanilla with Tbc class balance would be so amazing
---
&gt; Weird i made it to level 6 in 30 minutes via grouping.. all quests done too.
---
Depends on the area. I did all three Alliance starter zones last night. The gnome/dwarf area was easy. Teldrassil was harder, in part because of the low drop rate for venom from the spiders. Northshire Abbey was just swamped. 20-30 people at each spawn location. And that was with many level 1's simply leaving the area to gain exploration XP.
---
Why not?
---
I can’t blame you. I can’t even imagine trying to muster the will power trying to study for the CPA, do staff 3 work, and try to manage classic hype. 
---
Good luck and Godspeed getting those letters with classic release on the horizon, you’re gonna need it.
---
Layering is there for the aftermath of when people drop off and the tourists don't make it past level 10. It will be gone before Phase 1 is over AND this is still the damn beta TEST.  
---
Please go get a dictionary and look the word "test" up. It will be operational or worse case the launch might get delayed. This is a long term solution to population control that is NOT realm transfers which I think are even more harmful to the server identity / continuity.
---
I actually am looking forward to this. Sometimes I log into realms I haven't played since Classic or TBC, just to look at my various sets of rainbow armour.
---
And pets will be special again!
---
That's what dungeons were like back then if you were playing with competent players, too, so I don't know why you think there needs to be a change.
---
If you want it to be more difficult I'm sure you can find some bad players to run with to get the True Experience.
---
Torn between Shaman or Druid. I think shaman has more interesting/fun healing but druids can tank AND heal, have a lot of nifty forms (travel and aquatic), stealth and people really have a hate out for them, so just generally less competiton. If I can be 1 out of 20 feral tanks on a server, that'd be cool.
---
Just so you know, I've actually experimented with this and in full MC/ZG gear I topped meters with SoF build by stacking crit. Blanket statements like these are the dickish comments that you should avoid until you actually play the game
---
This is not a change, they're exactly as they were, everyone just got better. There will still be people playing classic for the first time who will probably not find it that easy. 
---
Also difficult and fun are not mutually exclusive.
---
I’d be all for it, but I know for sure that the general population here will absolutely not be.
---
"The unremoveable 1% resist" was in BC as well.  That is blizzlike.
---
I don't understand how people read this image as "Vanilla is remastered TBC" as you're not the only person to comment this way. The last picture is literally the first picture with the gaps filled in with simulated colors. It's not the same as the second picture if you compare them because it has entire chunks of it filled with with copy pasted parts of regions around it - it's a simulation of "what was the first picture supposed to look like", which IMO is a great metaphor for Classic.
---
&gt;how receptive is the general public to buffing dungeons?
---
This would please veterans who look for info and are prepared and all but it would fuck up newcommers. Majority of players don't read guides for this stuff. They just... *play* the game first. Making it more difficulty just to please a minority of players would be bad, imo.
---
Also, it wouldn't preserve the authenticity of the servers. This is meant to be a faithful recreation of Classic first and foremost, as much as possible, because the original game literally got mostly deleted with Cataclysm. If it's fun or not is secondary.
---
For all intents and purposes Gnome is the superior choice statistically. The one exception would be fighting a Rogue and knowing that they are nearby (hard one in WPvP to guess). They can still just wait out the 20 sec duration on Perception, but it does stack with Felhunter's paranoia so your reveal radius is quite large. 
---
Beyond that, Escape Artist is genuinely one of the best PvP racials for a lot of classes and Warlock is no exception. Being able to get out of a Hamstring or Crippling Poison within ~0,5 sec can make or break the fight against a Rogue or Warrior. 
---
For PvE, Gnomes have a small intellect bonus but beyond a few percentages you're not going to see much difference there so if that's your concern just pick whatever you like best visually.
---
It really was a joke. That’s why it blew up. It was the casual mmo of its day. Kinda like how here everyone says new mmo’s are a joke. That’s what people were saying about wow when it launched.
---
Fuck that whole AP system. I remember the first days, opening a world treasure that gave and AP item that granted like 10 AP, a day's worth of grinding instances and whatnot, get a thousand or 2 AP and work towards your traits.
---
Then the AK starts rolling and rolling and rolling and soon the same fucking world treasure that gave you 10 now suddenly gives you a million. More than you could possibly get in however many weeks at the start of the expac.
---
So what was the point of it in the first place? Could have just given the artifact trait unlocks at level ups or as achievement rewards for clearing XYZ instance, killing ABC boss on normal/heroic and so on.
---
I'm boring and would just ride the basic horses in BfA while everyone is riding some fantastic flashy mount around me so idc
---
you can have your shiny magnificent mechanodragontigerelephantbearstrider thingy if you want
---
I just want to get point A to point B on a horse, you do you
---
This is fantastic. INFPs are actually an extremely rare personality type so it’s incredibly strange to see them dominating the total make up of these players. It’s also fascinating that not one extroverted personality type was more prevalent than any introverted type. Very unique results.
---
Yes. 90% of guilds aren't hardcore enough for it to matter and another 5% will think it matters but it really doesn't.
---
Unless you're pushing for server firsts it really doesn't matter what you play, just don't expect to get in groups as easy as a frost mage can
---
They said there would be no layering at first
---
What makes you think they will stop layering after phase 1?
---
If the pops don't go down they won't, lol
---
I thought they wouldn't layer at all cuz Ion said he understood the importance of not having 4 instances of rich thorium veins across every layer...Look at us now
---
If it's the same type of armor. You can't make cloth look like plate or vice versa. Weapons are a little freer, you can generally make any 1h weapon your spec can use look like any other 1h weapon your spec can use... with some weird restrictions, like daggers. And wands, because wands are ranged, so you can't make the little glowy stick look like another kind of little glowy stick (1H mace).
---
Did you come up with this thought?
---
Thanks for the idea!
---
I haven't played the Beta so i cant say. Hell i never played Private why im so excited on the classic. So im not one to chime in here... But With the skill Gap improving from 2004 crazy i wouldn't Be Opposed to increasing Dungeon damage a Bit if it becomes that easy. Cause im seeing streamers doing instances almost 10 levels above them even if they have BIS... it still is a bit absurd 
---
This #NoChanges Movement i think is a bit silly. Like yeah don't change the playstyle but adding little things that don't effect the group is okay to me. But messing with the damage of Mobs could go so wrong cause blizzard tends to mess these things up. lol
---
not really, People are throwing it around when the game isn't even out yet . I feel like people should save this meme for when the games been out for a year and still thriving. posting that shit now makes no sense imo.
---
This thought process really does confuse me. Yes, retail sucks. Yes, Actiblizzard sucks. But they're also finally giving us something that we've wanted for a long time. That's a good thing, and considering them as MeAn bUsInEsSmEn bAdDiEs is a really toxic thought process.
---
Well i made it at the undead spawn right when everyone was able to login .. there were hundrets. It was slow the first 2 mins then i grouped up. When i was at the point where you have to share quest items and kill a named mob most people already gave up. Like there were people everywhere at the hundrets. But as i said grouping helped A LOT. 
---
Solo this would have taken ages.. alone because i dont have a instant attack.
---
I mean I really really hope that the game blows up to unexpected proportions and they add content like hyjal, dark portal (Classic version), Karazhan and whatever else makes sense. I really do. 
---
But I'd be surprised if that many people really stuck to the game.
---
That said, the fact that the two subs are bundled may make it more likely.
---
Oh man I remember armor dyes!  If we could go back I think i'd prefer something like that in WoW instead of transmog.
---
&gt;CEO
---
He's not CEO.  He's president of Blizzard Entertainment.  The CEO of Activision Blizzard is Robert Kotick.
---
 Also, 180 dollars?  Is that a typo or are you just literally insane?
---
Shit 24 hours lol. Tons of people are pissed theyre using the 1.12av
---
I've been filling the void with Dauntless during the wait. Just launched like a week ago, it's free and I'm addicted.
---
Fk off
---
nice gatekeeping
---
It's called weapon skill, not expertise. Expertise is a different stat which was added in TBC (while weapon skill was also present in the game and completely removed only in Cataclysm).
---
For me, ZF was second only to SM. Great dungeon!
---
You still have to be pretty much staring at your screen tho. There's mechanics to avoid even in vanilla. Plus mages have to decurse on a lot of bosses. From the look of it there won't be any druids to do that. 
---
Warlock doesn't have decurse and barely any encounters need banish. Maybe that would be better for what you need.
---
It’s kind of hard early on without raiding imo. This is shifting my view on rolling shaman at first, since I’ve played private servers for the past few years and the pvp gear was attainable as soon as I was 60. The level 58 pvp boots and chest were nice for pvp early on and the 60 legs and hands are amazing. 
---
If I had to go off the top of my head, several good pieces to have would be earthfury hands, ten storms legs, earthfury chest, mc mail shoulders that have 40 nature damage or denwatchers once DM is out, ten storms helm or green lens of nature’s wrath, earthfury bracers or sublime wrist guards once DM is out, chromatic cloak, belt of the archmage, eye of orgrimmar ring/maidens circle/that healing ring that’s pre raid bis, briarwood reed. 
---
Anyone feel free to add or correct me as I’m very used to using ranking gear early on.
---
We've all done it once. We've all got the accomplishment. (I think the number of people who use a paid boost or RaF *first time around* is actually quite low).
---
It's not a personality flaw not to want to grind out the same zones over and over on your thirteenth or fourteenth char.
---
I subbed and played BFA while waiting for Classic. Played alliance since the horde story is a mess.
---
Kul Tiras is such a mixed bag. The capital city felt big and sprawling but that's ruined by the fact you'll never leave the small city block all the amenities are in. Tirigarde Sound was nice to look at but it didn't hold up the Vykrul area of Legion, story was pretty weak at first, ending was cool but I didn't have the hype of the other zones. Stormsong is visually similar to too many previous zones, story started really strong with the Sea priests, got really dull when that ended. Quillboar are not an interesting antagonist when we've fought old gods. Duskvar was pretty great, felt like I was playing the Witcher. The fact that it was one solid story throughout with a cool payoff really helped. Felt a bit weird going from being the paladin who led the Silver Hand and had three grand relics to leading a small force of witch hunters but it was solidly done.
---
And then I got to Zandalar, and realized I sided with the wrong faction because god damn those zones were beautiful
---
(All my experience is from pservers so take it how you will) I did run into that problem farming DME so we started doing lasher packs as well and we would end up only having to wait like 5 minutes which was fine because they were nice little breaks. If we cleared faster we could have started clearing satyr packs for the herbs and demonic runes.
---
Does it not also reduce their reach as well?
---
In other PvP games I've played, you could tell the highly-skilled PvP players by the titles they wore related to PvP.  That guy in plain brown leather with the "Lone Enforcer" title? Meant 1000 solo kills in DAOC. In any case, since he was stealthed 99.9% of the time, you weren't going to see his armor to know how badass he was. I'm pretty sure WoW has PvP titles, too.
---
Yeah no one is pretending that streamers earned their achievements.
---
They aren't actually playing vanilla, because they are just going to have everything handed to them and they don't actually have to put in effort, just get carried
---
&gt;However, Some hunters go tauren because it's nearly impossible to deadzone a tauren hunter.
---
It's literally not. Melee and ranged is increased by the same amount. The deadzone is just at a different place, not smaller (in fact, if you want to be technical, the surface area is larger).
---
Skill has had a marginal increase in player effectiveness at best in every iteration of WoW
---
Hopefully they get started on wow2
---
It is a paper bag you put over your head.
---
not about roleplaying, really... part of the fantasy of playing a videogame is just being cool. and heroes look cool in some people's minds.
---
Except that they attack so slowly that their threat generation is spiky, and their threat will be slower to establish.
---
my guess is 100%+ peak, this thing is getting to be too big for it not to. it may not be the exact same twelve million as there have been many to leave permanently for various reasons and many new people to replace them. for sure this is getting to be the biggest thing.
---
DOn't worry!!!!\`\` it's a beta!!! it's for testing!!!!!
---
I mean I am happy to see most of the QoL changes go away, because they hurt the game, but I would like to see Dual Spec.
---
I like this idea... my biggest problem with TBC is increasing the level cap. 
---
Increasing the level cap makes all the classic content meaningless again, all your progress in classic is wiped clean.... 
---
Wow needs to build laterally not vertically
---
i played about 5+ hours on stress test was not that many people around if anything i feel like the layering is too strict.
---
id expect a stress test to be packed most quests had at most 5 people at it.
---
i saw pics of stormwind when i went there it was not crazy over populated
---
You are quite correct, it is. It's also gatekeeping.
---
No way I would have gone into lbrs to build my ubrs key if not for stealth runs. If you roll a druid, build a community of stealth runners. I wont be druid this time around but I will be rogue.
---
You'd have to completely redesign tbc and wrath zones if you removed flying, in reference to your edit.
---
Also, they're not trying to make "the best" wow experience with Classic. They're trying to recreate the feel of the original game.
---
[Troll]
---
Best comment on the forum that I have read this week
---
Druids don't have a taunt...
---
And you need 8 geared prot warriors for Naxx...
---
ahh yes it wasnt cover art. It was commercials and videos.
---
I always remember vanilla having no real pressing story, just multiple dangers, and TBC being based around the burning legion.
---
it wasnt till wrath that we had singular villains for whole expacs
---
Are you saying that TBC  gave out more greens? or that the power creep of the greens was to high? cuz i agree, i forgot about that outland greens should be hardly better than plagueland greens.
---
however as for useless dungeons, in vanilla while leveling you do a dungeon 1 or 2 times and move on, i feel farming out low level dungeons to be pointless. The same would be true with an expac after classic, you do strat and scholo a couple times and move on. but i agree those blues should last you a good while longer
---
The community has been playing for 14 years... We are now not Newbs. Gamers in general are better at games. It’s fine.
---
You don't have to use heirlooms though...
---
Why would it, i absolutely loved PvP back then and arena was an awesome playground to play on the highest lvl.
---
World PvP and Battlegrounds were still striving in those days and you could have just chosen not to play arena.
---
Yeah, I love to read the shit people say about WotLK. It was arguably the best expansion WoW had, judging by the sales and numbers. It's definitely my personal favorite but I wouldn't dare to outright say that it was better than the previous two version because they were too different and it's very personal.
---
WotLK is what ultimately led me to start playing in private servers, to be honest, because once it was done and Cata launched I realized game turned to a direction I don't want to follow it.
---
I returned for a while to WoD for the lore and I didn't regret it because lore was actually cool there, but for me WoW had its peak in WotLK.
---
That doesn't mean that it was worse in Vanilla or TBC - just that I enjoyed it most during WotLK.
---
From what I can see it was a scuffed sap. 
---
He aggro'd the other mob, which initiates combat for that group. When he vanished it reset the mobs which resets the status on them.
---
Tranquil air *replaces* windfury totel.
---
Salvation is just one of several available paladinbuffs.
---
The EXACT PLAN is:
---
1- Release Classic.  
---
2- Release Vanilla content until Naxx.  
---
3- Thrall gets nominated to the White House as an Independent.  
---
4- Wins the election.  
---
6- World domination, unsure if we're talking Azeroth or the other flat earth-world.  
---
5- Profit?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!11111111111SHIFTONEONEELEVENnN!1
---
Every server will have streamers guaranteed.
---
But the biggest issues (in my mind) with retail wow still existed:
---
- The loss adventure. Through trivializing the game world, loss of community interactions, and flattening the overall experience, they hollowed out what made the game feel like an adventure or even an RPG.
---
- A reward system that is poorly conceived. Before you would kill bosses hoping to get a piece of gear that you coveted. Maybe you never got it. (I still remember Hood of Hexing never dropping for me in Zul Aman. It was tragic. And I loved it.) This was a good use of RNG. Now you kill a boss hoping for a faceless piece of loot that matches your preferred stat distribution.
---
- Dungeon progression system. Not everyone agrees with me here, but heroic raids are terrible. Yes, if you make a linear dungeon system where you can't progress until you kill the final boss of the dungeon then many people won't experience all of the content in your game (cue the stat about only 1% of vanilla players seeing Naxx). But that's a good thing! It creates mystery and drama. Killing Vashj and Kael were some of the best gaming moments of my life.
---
Anyway, Legion was well done and parts were fun, but overall it was still a shell of what wow used to be.
---
Good luck with that, most people would seem to rather have a far easier experience than they did back then if it means the numbers are the same and they get gear quicker whether it's raids or dungeons. Most of the difficulty of MC was baked into the fact that you went from only grouping generally with 4  people to 39 people and it was a lot of player's first MMO but if you want a similar experience to what you had back then that's not relevant xD 
---
I'll be shocked if people equip remotely near the FR to do Ragnaros as they did when my guild or people I knew in other guilds were clearing it back then.
---
Thanks man!
---
I didn't know about it either till I bitched about private server drop rates and somebody else informed me it was changed during actual vanilla. Always a nice reminder that not only is our memory of vanilla suspect, the time at which we played a given class at a given level has massive effects on the validity of our memories as well.
---
Took your advice.

It landed on rogue. I was happy.

Just for fun, want to make a 3 silver bet?

Whoever loses will make a character on the winner’s server, grind 3 silver, and mail it.
---
Deal? :)
---
Hi, /u/usa_07041776
---
Don't say that too loudly, the Blizz that decided we didn't enjoy flying might actually do it on retail.
---
Ironically this quote applies exactly to retail. All the changes and qol they thought they wanted and now the game fails.
---
They each did some things better than the other 2.
---
So it really depends where your priorities lie.
---
Vanilla 
---
* best lore/feel/art
---
* best community feel
---
* best world pvp
---
TBC 
---
* arena
---
* good QoL stuff that was needed but not TOO much QoL (i.e. no dungeon finder)
---
* most specs were much improved (hybrids didn't have to heal, etc.) 
---
* harder 5 mans (heroics)
---
* best raids
---
WOTLK
---
* specs were further improved, mostly (although some homogenization began to happen). More depth and less 1 button specs which meant more room for good players to distinguish themselves.
---
* alt heaven
---
* DK/Lich King lore/feel
---
* some raids were meh, but also had 2 of the best raids ever
---
* some people preferred arena in this expansion to TBC's
---
I enjoy all 3. TBC overall has the most strengths and the fewest drawbacks, at least when it comes to things that matter to me. Really depends what things you enjoy though.
---
I was hoping to find a source containing all of the interface files in a .PNG format. Although, your link looks like it’ll help me extract all the interface images myself, if I can’t find a source of all of them pre-extracted.
---
I’ll use that info as a plan B, if I can’t find them pre-extracted and archived somewhere online. Thank you!
---
Roll dwarf and minmax consumables including flasks.

Dragonwelps in red ridge
---
That's not it. Personally, how would you deal with the inevitable population issues? There will be more people than there were at vanilla launch. Without layering, this is what would happen. There would be a lot of servers prepared to deal with the huge amount of people at launch. But since many of those people would essentially be tourists, many servers would die or be left with a very small population. Layering takes care of this problem entirely.
---
Not my first but maybe my 3rd trinket was heart of the mountain. I was proud to have made that.
---
City of Heroes.
---
You outdps'd the tier 2 hunters because you were leeching dps from their set bonus. Had you been in t2 as well, the total hunter dps would've been much higher.
---
Are you retarded?
---
You think you do
---
This was amazing. I remember running zf as much as possible for this moment.
---
Vanilla best overall, tbc best for raiding.
---
I'd say its classic is more approachable for a noob than the current Retail version. Its has a better RPG flavor.
---
You can always not reserve stuff.
---
Typically only tanks have the full freedom to reserve stuff without impacting group comps
---
SPriests with Fade become the main ranged DPS with hunters.
---
Oh god...
---
Being?
---
I farm gold on retail for WoW tokens to pay for classic lol
---
I believe Old school runescape did start to tail off and had new content created for it in the same vein as the original.
---
I wonder if that’s what will happen with wow- like a vanilla plus
---
That wolf is my absolute fave. My orc hunter runs around on it all the time.
---
I will miss the ease of AoE loot and vendor mounts, but I’ll live.  
---
LFD/LFR is the devil!
---
This, if a mob is in combat, like from a whole pack pulling, when they leave combat they heal to full and recover from debuffs.
---
I don't know about flawless, but I at least think vanilla would be better off.  There'd definitely have to be some adjustments too, like do you make 70 the max for the sake of talent points, TBC classes assuming raids would have access to both paladins and shamans, do you add/rework mechanics that may be trivialized by TBC stuff, etc.  All doable, but certainly more than just a copy-paste job.
---
I also think it would be acceptable if, assuming Blizzard decides to add stuff to classic, they added class-specific weapons/trinkets/totems/etc that would give a version of TBC abilities.  Like a priest trinket that makes your shadow damage give mana to the party.
---
Exwife and yes, he was born in 2003 and I was a stay at home dad for first couple years.
---
There are several things I’m also excited for in Classic. I am NOT wanting these changes to be in Classic. I’m wanting to help see the positives of not having these QoL changes in Classic. For example, people say not having transmog is a positive because you can visually see right off the bat how powerful someone is. “Oh damn he’s in full bloodfang armor! I’m dead!”
---
Ruthless truth. Love it.
---
Arena's devolved into pillar humping crap fests.  They also killed the rock paper scissors balance to the group aspect of class balance and instead made it such that classes had to be balanced to a 2v2 scenario.
---
This was part of what led to class homogenization.
---
I much preferred objective focused battlegrounds to action focused arenas.  The mentality around arenas is kind of what led to making Wow a nonstop instant gratification action game.  Instead of a role playing game.
---
You mean you're not supposed to hold an Arcanite Reaper like a weeb with a mallninja sword?
---
Transmog was QoL? In what way?
---
I don't want ANY of these.
---
Yeah, I just don't see it being efficient. 25-38g per hour per player isn't very good.
---
bah.. i cant find the video. there was an implication that aside from the standard "lmao dragons are immune to fire!!!!!" type tropes in the game, some bosses were to have resist tables exclusive to them
---
Its because blizz doesn't want to release hundreds of servers with \~3k caps even though I think thats what they should do.
---
Play for one month then decide if you want to continue I guess.
---
&gt; Everyone can one-shot and death doesn't matter
---
If that's your preference, great. I think that this sort of combat is quite a bit more stupid than warlock/druid being hard to kill in TBC, or mace stun. Certainly there were still classes that could burst pretty well in TBC, just not to the levels of vanilla. If you're complaining about the combat format (duels vs. CTF), BGs were not dead in TBC. Arguably removing the honor group premade stomps made them more fun as a lone player or going in with your arena team. 
---
&gt; Did you grind rep in vanilla
---
Yes, I had all BGs exalted and rank 11. lol. I didn't grind Timbermaw so you got me there
---
Warriors with the noobForce were everywhere. Tier 0.5 is similar to the heroic epics you're complaining about. BTW heroic shattered halls was hard at least to start. If you want to complain about epic gear stupidity, I would say that things like Felstriker being random dungeon drops and outclassing raid gear is more up there. But pick your poison 
---
In any case the color of the gear doesn't matter. It's that you have a progression with meaningful tiers. Certainly TBC had that. For people that love BWL keying - remember [this bad boy](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Instance_attunement_\(Burning_Crusade\)?file=Bcattunement.jpg)?
---
Unstoppable force was not a low chance, it was all the damn time I swear, compounded by the fact that it was the best weapon most warriors could get. Stormherald was outclassed by other easily obtainable weapons quite quickly iirc so nobody used it after the initial couple months. In any case I was more annoyed that shadow resist gear could be swapped in than Stormherald, by far.

You clearly misunderstand what I’m asking...
---
The thumbnail reminds me of that book the balloon farm
---
Begone with your logic, you delusional #nochanges moron!
---
Just sayin, if someone wants their account hacked by another salty player, that’s the way to do it.
---
...?
---
In my mind letting everyone see it on story mode is what leads the game to feel like a theme park more than a sandbox mmo. Theres a value to having an exclusive club of the best players beating the big boys, then coming home to tell the story. I liked how they did this with the Lich King cinematic being tacked on a memorial monument in dalaran. Then you still get the cutscenes in game.
---
It was possibly the best or second best WoW expansion. It had some glaring problems (AP farm, the random Legendary system) but overall /u/Living-Bones got it down pretty well.
---
That said, in some ways it was only so good because it came after the horseshit that WoD was. It still had many of the problems that classic lovers generally have with retail WoW. Like lack of incentive to socialize, flying (eventually), zones that were not designed well for the no-flying at the start of the expansion or content becoming irrelevant every time new content is released... that kinda stuff.
---
But for where WoW is/was at the time, Legion was pretty fucking good.
---
Got it, cheers guys, myth BUSTED!
---
Officers being on the ball basically means having something like those rankings set up in advance anyway. Certainly doesn't need to be that in depth or even committed to paper somewhere, but for high value items you should pretty much know who the next few to get it will be.
---
My brother and I used to swap a few characters between our accounts all the time. Our accounts aren't linked, we just have the same last name on them and it was never questioned.
---
Ask customer service, they're the only ones who can help you. If you need your brother's account info, ask him if he can unlock the account for you.
---
It is a flaw.
---
If I reach 60 I want to know that all other players who reach 60 to go trough the same shit. If I find out you had a boost then that just ruines my game.
---
How boring would Lord of the Rings been if Frodo would just get on one of those eagles from Gandalf and fly from the Shire to Mordor, drop the ring in the fire and fly back.
---
This is the answer. You can still aggro a sapped target via mobs that are “connected” to the sap target. When you vanish and break combat with the sapped target it resets with every other mob. 
---
This is why improved sap is so good
---
Haven’t played wow in years. Played mainly during Tbc, then stopped. Played a tiny bit for one or 2 expansions but barley.
---
I’m so hyped for classic
---
^
---
Completely alienate seems off the mark. Classic has interest from past and present players alike. When better product was from 15 years ago, its time to reevaluate what the current product is offering.
---
I'm unsure what kind of micro transactions blizzard has in mind for Classic, if any. Drawing more players into Retail is increasing the cash cows Blizzard can milk. I don't see why Blizzard wouldn't make Retail as attractive as possible, even with 'Classic bucket'.
---
Many people forget that the first time doing dungeons were in a patch long before 1.12 where many classes had less than optimal talents than they have at 1.12 and is an experience that will never be replicated because we are not going back to square one talent trees. 
---
This isn’t to blame everything on this fact, as we are all better at the game and would figure it out, but overall classes were weaker in retail vanilla. I remember me and my friend created mages once and spaced arcane just so we could do instant arcane explosions together Bc u needed talents to make it an instant cast. Iirc I believe it used to have a 1.5 sec cast time.
---
That’s why we’re going to do all gathering. Aside tailoring on mage and alchemy . Tailoring actually sells while leveling and so does alchemy. The enchanting is really more for DE plus he can sell enchants with the DE material. This way we don’t have to try and AH
---
Why is LFR bad? Honest question. I’m really wanting to understand the Classic community and be one of you guys.
---
&gt;This is not a change.
---
The world around WoW has changed significantly, which has made the game subsequently astronomically easier than it was designed to be. 
---
This is absolutely a change.
---
Once you get through MC you can switch to fire.
---
AoE looting is bad because it just vacuums up all the loot. You rarely go "shit, I need to make sure I don't aggro something looting this body"
---
I'm personally a fan of *limited* flying, like in BC, but the argument is that flying shrinks the world and allows you to bypass most of the "real world" feel of it.
---
Sharding/cross realm breaks down the feeling of server community. Raid/group finder is the same way as well as dumbing the game down with more forgiving mechanics.
---
Anyone who dislikes Dual Specs and Transmog though are the people who think that Blizzard is wrong in everything they do.
---
What I hate is getting a fabulous raid weapon from MC that I like the look of, and realizing that it's useless and will never be used because my character isn't that spec, and a week later he's leveled past the point where it is any good anyway, because BC gear makes MC gear look like starter gear. 
---
Transmog let me use that piece on another character who it did look good on, even if he couldn't use that weapon himself (because it was soulbound on the first character--not being able to pass weapons down to your "kids" is immersion-breaking if you ask me)
---
Bosses were confirmed to be doing appropriate damage (well, one of them)
---
Elite mobs have not been commented on; there’s still the possibility that they’re doing incorrect damage - normal mobs are hitting just as hard
---
To be fair I thought it'd uninteresting as well. It wasn't until seeing it played again did it become obvious how much the game has worsened by removing the RPG elements.
---
Yes.. thats my entire point. The game should adjust for skill/knowledge inflation.
---
Druids have 2 taunts in Classic, one regular and one AoE.

No disrespect to streamers, I enjoy them from time to time and appreciate the content. Just running on a streamer server in classic with so many grinds I want to feel like I have a chance.
---
Exactly this!
---
As far as I can tell, there's only one FP in all Durotar....
---
Yes. A simpler time. I like being able to tell what a person is wearing by looking and not needing to inspect them.
---
I don't think raids are going to hold any real meaning after the server first. Theres over a decade of info on how to down every boss,  and almost everyone is going to be min/maxing because they're worried they won't be good. I hope they add different content after the last phase. That way everything will be new again. I think people are romanticizing classic wow a bit
---
I don’t see windows xp?!
---
We used dkp with silent bid in vanilla and tbc and I liked it. I never experienced loot councils, it sounds optimized and boring and I hope my classic guild won't use it.
---
they spam sit on most bosses for rage, dont think getting crit is any less damage than a few parry hastes
---
Nobody asking the question "can I raid with this spec" is asking "can I raid in a server first progression guild with this spec"
---
Hi. I'm not a toxic child like they few who have commented so far. I think the differences are scary and offputting at face value and require experiencing to appreciate. The immersion gained from physically having to travel alone makes it feel more like a living, breathing world. I was never a transmog guy so the thought of being able to look at an enemy, identifying their armour, and having some semblance of an idea what to expect really interests me. AoE looting is a QoL I could get behind. Dual spec as well... if it had a 1 week cooldown or something. Raid/Group finder is absolute cancer. Teleporting across the world and being placed with randoms completely strips the immersion.
---
Like I said, you'll need to experience it to feel the difference. Maybe it's not for you
---
Once we are all in our T3, we all meet in one spot and have a neverending full-server world PvP battle.
---
5 days is unrealistic, and 6 is super fast still. You need to set your expectations lower.
---
And wait are you implying real world days?
---
Be warned, you won't find a place with bigger egos and drama than where roleplayers and PvP'ers come together.
---
I wonder if Blizzard would consider re-implementing certain infamously buggy quests. Same quests as before but executed with more reliable scripting behind the scenes. Another one that comes to mind is a quest in Ashenvale to assault a Night Elf base that would intermittently fail.
---
Unlikely. If you're a streamer, you'll want to play "where the action is". Where is the action? With other streamers.
---
&gt;All tanks will take more damage, and the percentage of damage taken relative to each other tanking style will be the same.  
---
&gt;Also tanks don't die to one spike of parry haste or even two crits in a row.
---
Exactly this. Druids also typically have a higher effective health to soak up burst damage. There's also plenty of evidence pointing towards bosses in actual raids dealing less damage per hit than on private servers which means a meagre 9% additionaly Parry just wont make that big of a difference.
---
Here's one comparison I did a while back. The image on the left is from 2006 taken from my own recording tanking C'Thun with 7/8 T2 and roughly 10k armor.
---
The image on the right is my own Druid on private servers with 15.000+ armor. Even when factoring in def stance and the Block value we can see the tentacle hit much much harder on private servers. This is just one of many such comparisons.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png)
---
The biggest difference I expect to see is that threat on pull will be more subject to RNG, and we are back to the good old "Wait for 3 Sunders" style of playing. But this will hold true for every class that can tank.
---
tomatoe tomato
---
I would be fine with a middle ground where only the player can see their transmog. I honestly am not excited to look like an idiot with random thrown together gear lol... I will honestly take a hit to having BiS if it means I can be in full bloodfang or whatever lol
---
Assume all you want. If layering behaves like sharding on launch I’m unsubscribing until it’s gone. But so far it looks like they’re very cognizant of how much people don’t want sharding-like behavior and will do everything in their power to avoid it on launch.
---
I really don’t get what you’re trying to do by freaking out in the sub about this. If you’re trying to keep blizzard in check, do it on the wow forums. If you’re trying to expose some grand sharding conspiracy or knock down people who want classic to be like retail, you’re fighting straw men.
---
The reason IQD pvp was so great was because you could easily rope other people into the war that didn't go there to pvp. It's like if level capped players were forced to farm raid mats in hillsbrad. Sure it sucks to have one side ruling over tarren mill or SS with an iron fist uncontested but if there's always an opposing force present it makes for some exciting world pvp!
---
&gt; But let's be real, there's no way they're not going to stream the launch.
---
They'd be stupid not to.  All their viewers will just head off to another stream to watch.
---
&gt;Hes not wrong though. People on reddit think they're the hot shit and that they're the core audience in every game and they're not. You, on this classic focused subreddit, are part of a minority. The number of people total who want to play wow pales in comparison to most modern games. MMOs are an already niche market, every change in wow has been to open the game up more to a larger audience.
---
Says the guy on the classic forum, using Reddit. I know I'm not the core audience anymore, the fact that I want games with old school mechanics should make that obvious. Blizzards goal is to make games more accessible to increase revenue. Also, them releasing classic is admitting they are wrong. His famous heavy handed quote is answering the question if they would ever create a server that's just vanilla, he goes on to say they would never do it. So they are already eating their own words. I can only speculate why they would want to do something like that.
---
&gt;My honest prediction is that if classic succeeds, retail will only become more casual and player friendly. For the relatively few but loud complaints they'll just say"go play classic".
---
Uh yeah, of course they are going to simplify it more. The relaunch of classic is to capture the old fan base that left. That's really it, there is nothing special about it beyond that. And I'm perfectly ok with that. I'm getting to experience a game that Blizzard said they would never, ever, re-release. Period. End of story. So the fact that they are doing it is good enough for me. And classic will be a success, go to any private server and listen to people talking about moving their guilds to the relaunch. Just look at the streams of modern players endorsing the game. Classic was and still is a great game. There is a reason it averaged a 90% when it came out. Starcraft 1 is still a great game, I still play it to this day, same with warcraft, warcraft 2, and 3. 
---
&gt;They're not stupid, they know what the audience wants and if anything I think their biggest fuck up is that they still listen to vocal minorities at all instead of just doing what they want and going for the bigger pool of audience.
---
You can listen to a vocal minority and still make games that appeal to the majority. Classic is evidence of that. We are talking about a multibillion dollar company. The sky is their limit now, it would be absurd to distance themselves from any prospective customer. This isn't the tiny company that made diablo 1, warcraft, and starcraft anymore. Why do you think they are remastering or completely redoing their old IP's? It's because they are *great* games. 
---
&gt;But this was a long post just to say all of us here on reddit mean Jack shit to blizz compared to the larger audience they cam draw in.
---
Then why the hell did you even write anything?
---
hopefully it's been in development for years so we can pay for alpha before we die of old age
---
Can confirm.
---
Smart

Wooshception

It’s lvl 50

The rare cat from badlands is bis for pvp.

It completely removes the 'oh that guy looks badass, I better avoid him' to 'hey guys, look at me! I'm wearing a spongebob hat! hur hurrrr'
---
Asmongold tried to cheat the layering system yesterday by having everyone on his layer invite people from others layers. There were 4 different layers where he was
---
the servers definitely couldn't handle it, it was laggy as hell it was like 1 refresh  every 10 seconds and people were teleporting  and phasing out.
---
I don't know how many people it took to make it fully unplayable, I'd say like 400/500. At one point the servers actually crashed. And this wasn't in combat
---
It would be very hard to count exactly how many people there were but it would be interesting.
---
Then stop talking about immersion, if you don't want immersive aspects. Your argument is self-contradictory and poorly thought-out. Every single sentence is demonstrably wrong.
---
Like that idea, and it'll be good to have one of each gathering profession but not overlap (compete for nodes if you play together constantly).
---
Are you on US? Make an alliance on  Moonguard or a horde on Wrymrest Accord. 
---
Walk around and see how people interact and read their profiles if you want to download Total Roleplay. There's plenty of full LARP style players but also plenty of people just playing and doing their own thing for the atmosphere.
---
Bad news. water elemental was added in TBC.
---
Warlocks don't have sheep, but they do get seduce at 20, which only works on humanoids, but has the benefit of not healing the mob to full.
---
The druid/priest/lock combo also has some potential to be sick. Priest goes shadow up to VE, they could generate tons of healing while doing damage. It's a lot easier to support locks LTing as a priest/druid thanks to their instant-cast HoTs, and the synergy between Imp SB and Shadow Weaving is nuts. Main downside is you're looking at 100% gear overlap between the two classes when where you really want to be is with a group that can use everything that drops.
---
Certainly not disagreeing with the original war/mage/pally comp you laid out, just sayin'
---
Can't say anything on the damage side but if the debuff slots are you only worry they are sticking to 16 from day one.

---
There’s so many more things I’m excited for in Classic WoW than retail though. I’m just trying to see all the positives in Classic is all :)
---
Ah sorry. Didn't realize you were interested in PvE factors as well. As someone else said. 30/0/21 will be fine for healing in dungeons. But it can definitely be a liability for raid groups since you'll go OOM easier.
---
LFR is bad because it requires no skill, no cooperation and removes all communication. It turns the hardcore endgame activities into theme parks that you can just casually stroll through. Downing a raid boss should feel like an accomplishment that you and your team overcame together and not just a casual activity that you got auto-added into and doesn't require you to do anything.
---
Still going to end up being accurate for most people, probably. 
---
The thing to remember is that it doesn't matter if most people end up realizing they don't actually want to play Vanilla. What matters is that *enough* people maintain interest to keep a good sized community alive.
---
Every time players tried to use to populations of private servers to argue for the interest in Vanilla servers, even the most generous estimates of number of players were orders of magnitude smaller than the retail population. 
---
Classic was always going to be a risk for Blizzard. It's still a risk. Hopefully it's cheap enough to develop and maintain that it can stick around and remain lively for those who've wanted it for so long. But the "you think you do but you don't" quote will certainly be true for millions of players. Literally millions. 
---
Already, in some of my friend groups who had played Vanilla and are interested in Classic, they're saying things like "if it has LFD and slightly faster leveling, it'd be perfect." These are the types of people who are going to drop off within a couple months.
---
If I don't use them, the gear still feels pointless, because I know I can just equip an heirloom.  It's also a disservice to the rest of the group to purposefully handicap myself just so drops matter.
---
It's kind of the same as how the raid tiers have ruined the feeling of getting a first kill.  Beat a boss on LFR, who cares, it's just LFR.  Beat it with the guild and who cares, we already beat it on LFR.
---
Mvp comment
---
Because you can’t tell if someone is geared or not based on their appearance. This is huge for pvp. 
---
Also it devalues gear a tad. Before transmog I’d be so hype to get my set shoulders, now shoulders are just bracers with more stats
---
Old DAOC player?
---
Female NE wins easily.
---
Second line of defense is to recruit old friends to play again. Marginally more successful
---
People who have the beta...
---
I don't remember fire being very good for BWL. I thought people switched at ZG but then you have to respec when you're guild is doing the other three raids.
---
As I said in a child comment, I'm not one to give much import to Myers-Briggs as an accurate indicator of true human behavior. But it's good as a mirror to show what people think their behavior is and how they go about constructing that social mask. To wit, it's both interesting and entirely unremarkable that all of the "introvert" personalities are far more common in a community like this than they would be in a random subsampling of the population as a whole, since the people who gravitate to niche gaming subreddits talking about yet-unreleased 13-year-old retro rereleases of old MMOs are clearly going to view themselves as introverts, regardless of the truth of that matter.
---
lmao
---
I didn't say these dungeons were supposed to be super difficult. Do you disagree that they will be *even easier* than designed to be? 
---
Why is a minor adjustment for skill/knowledge inflation so bad an idea? Its not 2005...
---
This was actually windows PX, it was an unreleased version of XP 🙂
---
I feel like I'm at Bonnaroo
---
It will take way longer to get out of the instance and reset it, as the /reset and camp macro doesnt port you back to the beginning of the run in classic
---
Passive. Equal to 3 stealth levels
---
Iirc it's a passive +1 to your effective level.
---
I mean, Magister's Terrace basically required a mage, to the point that people were actually paying for mages to run it with them.
---
Wrong, it's 4 and what, 3 hours? At launch it might be slower if the initial zones are a fuck to get through. Although, layering MIGHT mitigate the clusterfuck.
---
WoTLK was great in story...until they decided it made sense for the argent tournament to be thrown basically at arthas's doorstep, AND be the raid you kill Anub'arak in, giant lore character from wc3, who deserved much better
---
Yeah rogues and hunters were really plentiful in vanilla
---
Yes, there are like 3 night elves in the crowd. Dwarves and Gnomes are low so you wouldn't be able to see them if they were standing inside the crowd ;)
---
Then I have a game for you that's already out... retail WoW.
---
My buddy had the starter nightsaber until 45 lol. I kept telling him to tame a new one but he didn’t listen
---
I was worried it would work like that. I was hoping it would be like live where you can chat with people in channels and guild even though they aren’t on your shard.
---
I wonder if there's anyone on the Alliance who doesn't have strong memories of that flight.
---
It's like having a glimpse of what's to come. Everything's on fire, demons, dragons! It's so far removed from the safe forests and mountains you start out in. And to think that one day, you'll be strong enough to take them on.
---
It gets your blood pumping. I never reached the Burning Steppes or Searing Gorge during Vanilla, so I can't wait for Classic to come so I can finally, *finally* visit those zones. 14 years of waiting are about to be over.
---
Then of course there's the question: what class?
---
That question I'm afraid will haunt me for a couple decades at this point.
---
And whatever the fuck you do DO NOT stand next to other people
---
&gt; All the Argent Dawn/Crusade lore was still there, but the RPG aspect of the gear rep etc. was nullified, so the lore was not consistent with the rewards, breaking my immersion. Immersion for me is 100% why I loved Vanilla, and it turned into "me playing a game" instead of me in the world, experiencing events as my character.
---
What's interesting is that Blizzard recognized this issue and wrote the lore around it. Argent Dawn &gt; Argent Crusade, Scarlet Crusade &gt; Scarlet Onslaught. But it felt immensely cheap. They became "just another faction rep grind". You'd think being exalted with the Argent Dawn would have some kind of perk or benefit for the Argent Crusade since it's literally most of the same people, but Blizzard shortsighted it because they wanted you to farm for the reputation.
---
This is fundamentally the issue with hand-holding the player through the story rather than letting the player create their own. Vanilla had a lot of small stories that you could pick and choose from, but the overarching story was non-existent - you were just another adventurer representing your faction.
---
One of the other things that frustrated me from expansion to expansion was the whole concept of a safe-haven in neutral territories. It makes sense that if I'm AFK in Stormwind that I can't be ganked unless I'm flagged, but if I'm in Shattrath then I should still be able to attack Horde players - just make the guards actually do their fucking jobs instead of standing around senselessly. It's why I loved the Isle of Quel'Danas so much - half of the fun was that I could attack players/goad players into attacking me and then make a game of avoiding the guards. Same with the Argent Dawn in EPL.
---
This directly relates back into the whole 'create your own story' idea. If two rival factions are on a tenuous treaty, there shouldn't be some safe haven for them all. If I attack a player, the guards should come murder me. To enforce peace. If you kill a guard, you lose a shitton of rep with that city. Let me make my own choices, especially if I want to play as a neutral-party character.
---
Gnome is better overall but pick what you like
---
me and a friend are planning to do just that - we have a bank holiday here in the UK on the 26th so we are going to go for a long weekend camping, then get home on august 26th (launch will be just before midnight for us i think)
---
spend the entire night waiting in a queue or waiting for blizz to fix servers - then game the entire week.  it's going to be eye-destroyingly good :D
---
The argument that I've heard that I find convincing is that visual progression (getting pretty gear) is a valuable game reward and having the ability to transmog reduces that value to pretty much nothing.
---
If you see someone with a bad ass sword in classic, it's a bad ass sword.  If you see it in retail, it could be a grey for all you know.
---
None of these reasons make any difference - your resto druids can bres and innervate as needed. High TPS bear tanks will allow your dps to go hard and kill the boss before your healers run out of mana anyway. If your raid consistently needs 3+ BR or innervate per fight you need a new guild.
---
Shield wall is irrelevant, bears survive fine tanking on Pservers right now (where damage is 30-50% higher than beta numbers) and warriors are dual wield tanking without shields. Survival will be trivial, and TPS is all that is going to matter, and bears put out more of it earlier than warriors.
---
Lol the original suggestion was just streamers and that’s it. That’s what I was arguing against. Streamers+followers is a whole different suggestion, and not something that I would find a problem with
---
Dunno, that Orc M looks kinda like the Ministry of Silly Walks to me.
---
Finally someone who was smart enough to disable the character names for good picture.
---
People in this thread are examining the viability of boomkins in the context of a progression raiding guild, hence the photo of the boomkin killing C'thun from retail vanilla.
---
Can blur the name on the screen
---
This is the most wrong you could type in reply.  It isn't a vanish.  It doesn't drop combat.  It does give you effective stealth levels.
---
It does matter in vanilla for pvp purposes more so than it does for retail.  It was handy to know how geared someone was in vanilla and you could easily do that via what they had on.  In retail how much hp they have is a decent indicator of their gear level to a degree which it wasn’t in vanilla.
---
haha yeah its so tight in there.  and the boat sequence is pretty horrific too what with the multiple levels and closely packed mobs
---
This guy knows what’s up.
---
Thank you for your honest reply. I’ve seen so many people who played in Vanilla, got to experience the full feeling of immersion, got to experience what the game was like before all the QoL changes and have experienced the positives first hand.
---
That’s the perspective I’m wanting. I don’t have the experience of how great it was before LFR, flying, etc. I want to be excited like the players in vanilla are... people in the comments thus far are clearly misunderstanding me...
---
I enjoy retail as well. I never said I didn't. However, you cannot deny that Blizzard is putting fewer and fewer resources into the game than they did previously. Nearly every mechanic added since Legion has been designed to reduce development costs. Raid armor is a good example. Only 4 armor sets reduces art costs. No tier bonuses reduces balancing costs. The way items are statted reduces balancing costs. Customer service is more and more automated. Patches continue to fail to fix core gameplay issues.
---
Retail is fun, but BFA is severely flawed and it's because Blizzard isn't paying it as much attention or care as they should. They actively refused to listen to BFA beta feedback.
---
They hurt the game because they make it easier. Its a weird concept but by making everything easy you remove all feelings of accomplishment. If you don't struggle and fail, your successes won't bring you nearly as much satisfaction.
---
Ingame days. I am not saying il be as fast as Joana, il be about day or two off (ingame). But top end players who know vanilla inside out will be doing it under 5 days /played. Unless ofc the 1-12 will be hard to get through due to mob tagging etc...
---
Flying is SO not a quality of life change. A quality of life change is something like the keyring or guild banks that lets you do what you could already do, but with less logistical hassle. Flying changed the game *completely*.
---
To clarify, as in a level 30 would have a stealth level of 153, or 165?
---
Yeah, it's hilarious how people are loving classic because they have to grind and actually earn their loot. But at the same time people like Asmon literally AFK and have groups do everything for him, and yes they will be arrogant enough to boast about having tons of stuff and server firsts. :/  
---
No surprise this generation of kiddos that was raised on social media are coming out to defend their precious streamers, or worse streamers they pay money to. Why watch average players with dogshit personalities play a game. It's not like they are watching some pro match when watching the likes of pokimane :/
---
I mean those class balance issues existed in vanilla as well. A SL warlocks felhunter can solo a mage. Aim shot crits and shaman burst can drop people in 3-4 seconds.
---
Don't roll on leather as warrior, especially during lvling
---
You could shadowmeld in combat?
---
Can you prove a majority want easier content?
---
That feeling when you get the majority of t2 is unmatched in any other game. Ever. You will feel like you're the fucking man. Just wait, you'll see
---
The core elements of Classic is what I loved about it. 
---
I feel like most the quality of life changes (LFR,LFD, CRZ and Flying etc) were all mistakes that have hurt the RPG and community elements of the game.

Don't remind me. I just completed Draenor Pathfinding on my Alliance main (as opposed to my Horde main, who is twiddling his thumbs waiting for 8.2 to drop so he can get BFA Pathfinding part 2). The Tanaan Jungle grind was miserable until I figured out that the 3 Saberstalker targets also dropped the rep macguffins daily. OTOH, I did see far more of Draenor and do far more WoD quests than I would have if I just blasted through it leveling up.
---
Gear = player competence. You don't get gear equivalent to full bloodfang by getting lucky titanforges from Sunken Temple
---
Badges were in TBC from launch. It just wasn’t until Sunwell patch that badge gear was on par with high end raiding loot. That’s when it became an issue. Prior to that, it was just to fill holes in your pre-Kara gear.
---
Also, attunements are fun and all at the start. It feels good to go through and get attuned to the raids initially. First kills on Vashj and Kael and entering Hyjal and BT for the first time were awesome.  But after a while, it became a chore. Having to go back and drag new recruits through re-kills on those bosses in order to progress through BT lost any bit of fun very quickly.
---
If you want an actual MMORPG to play then you should try classic. Legion/Retail isn't an MMORPG anymore. Classic is difficult, immersive, and has a large community.
---
I think you just suck as a hunter. There's hundreds of hunters that can kick most ass.
---
WoW classic is a museum piece, not an esports endeavor.
---
Bad troll is bad
---
Make a lot of gold, there is nothing much to do in this first stage, work on your profs, get your epic mount, keep piling up gold, MC is a faceroll raid you don't even need gear for it just consumes and knowledge
---
Flyijg mounts ruin world pvp, AoE looting hurts the economy, cross realm ruins the community, dual spec hurts the economy, group finder hurts the community.
---
so i wont be inviting anyone to my group if im killing a named mob
---
That hurts everyone who isn’t an experienced gamer or wow vet trying it out. I plan on playing with my wife this time around. She is as green as they come in regards to gaming. If I was too, where would we be left if blizzard decided to buff content for everyone who has been there done that? Even though I’m not green, I’d rather they not buff everything so I don’t have to drag my wife along in content that is overtuned for new players.
---
imo it would be hard to add Outland without flying, assuming you were adding the whole thing with quests and instances. There are a fair number of places that you can't access without flying.
---
But it wouldn't be that hard to keep it limited to Outland. That's how it was for years and people survived just fine.
---
At least you tried champ.
---
I vastly prefer 24 or 9 cats to herd to 39 or 19 cats to herd.  Also, arenas.  In summation, you are wrong.
---
He’s trashing classic in a classic forum, stating opinion as fact, and gave a tldr on a 20 second read. He’s an idiot or a troll
---
Classic summer is the tail end of august so you never know
---
I would imagine it would be crazy for a fury warrior given each additional swing would grant additional rage. Probably would be pretty crazy for a decked prot warrior running into rage gen issues until they get thunderfury too. But no one really knows the true proc rate since private servers all guessed it.
---
On top of it having an extremely low drop chance, depending on proc chance,  it could end up being a BiS warrior weapon, or absolute trash.
---
Edit: Typo
---
You can already collect a set of gear solely for its cosmetics and keep a bag of that for swapping into whenever you're hanging around town or whatever. I myself collected a full set of Shadowcraft on a fury warrior pre-TBC for comedy purposes. Transmogs effectively let you do the same thing with reduced hassle caused by needing to swap the gear or clutter your bags, so just like the keyring, it functionally *is* a QoL improvement.
---
The complaints about not being able to tell how geared someone is are valid though, but a simple menu toggle would be enough to fix that.
---
This is a really interesting set of data! Added my info as well :)
---
Terrible in pvp? Lol you're in for a surprise.
---
Convenience makes the things we do less notable. 
---
I recently returned from an arduous backpacking trip. I could have used those two weeks vacation to lounge around on a beach. I could have gone to an all-inclusive resort and stuffed myself with unlimited high-quality food. Instead my vacation was to go do something that is more difficult than my regular life.
---
Why did I do it? I felt *genuinely* rewarded by the experience because I had to work for it. It's a genuine challenge vs. coasting easily through something. My knees were sore on day six and I worried that I wouldn't be able to finish the hike but I persevered. The freeze-dried food got very boring to eat so when I got an In-and-Out burger every cell in my body screamed thanks in unison for the fatty sugars. We had windy, rainy weather much of the time and so I'm sitting here at my desk luxuriating in my wool socks and dry clothes. My father was delighted to hear my praise for the neck kerchief he gave me for Christmas; who'd have imagined that something so simple would have provided 10 different uses and helped me so much? He's big on functional gifts and he and I enjoyed talking about how his $9.99 gift was an All Star. 
---
In WoW every convenience item you add in precludes you from having to earn something. From having to persevere. I miss having to work for it because, when you do, you feel like it's *worth doing* and, when you win, you feel satisfied and, perhaps, proud. Especially when you can tell the stories. It felt very good typing the previous paragraph out and assuming that some people will read it and perhaps admire my experiences.
---
I mean it's not that it *doesn't work* just not having a taunt is pretty shitty
---
If you were expecting an actual discussion about this, unfortunately this sub isn't the place. Far too many angry gatekeepers ruin any chance of just discussing anything like this.  
---
It seems like not many people know that you can dislike something and be able to talk about it without hyperbole and hysterics.
---
Why is power creep necessary?
---
Id say its literally one of the things killing the game. Each time a new raid opens up, the previous patches content and raids are made useless for gearing, instantly making incredible amounts of content completely pointless.
---
Same goes for expansions. A new expansion immediately makes everything that happened in the previous expansion essentially dead content for anything other than leveling.
---
I think there's one at Razor Hill... isn't there? It's been 12 years so I could be wrong.
---
Ofc not.
---
Nope
---
Hunter second to last? Whaaaaaat?
---
What announcement?
---
1. Just because you have low dps does not mean you are terrible in pve. That's stupid talk. Whatever hunters are used for doesn't really matter they are used. You have raidspots. And playing a hunter is in raids is a LOT of fun. I've played EVERY SINGLE dps class in raids, and I rate hunter as #2 on most fun, below fury warriors. Also the "hunters do low dps" is a complete fucking meme. Hunters beat mages and warlocks all the way until ZG, which is for over half of the game.
---
2. They're one of the strongest duellist and are always used in premades.
---
3. People who enjoy difficulty? Also manage ammo? Every class has some stupid shit to manage. Warriors has to keep 3 different item sets in bags, rogues has to have posions ready and have mats for vanish and blind, warlock has soulstones which they actually have to farm too, and the other classes has some other mats they need for abilities.
---
4. Who the fuck cares.
---
Taking advantage of people. Just kidding, but basically selling wands for 70s each , when it's only 8s to buy and buying linen for low and selling high by creating the green chest and legs. I was probably the highest tailor on the server .
---
Oh really? I thought it would randomly also start music sometimes. Or is that because I probably walked into another area? (Like, the area's you'll have to explore, the sub-zone areas?)
---
Sorry, Coe/Immolate and spam shadowbolt with your shadowweave set on. Right to the top of the meters we go. Immolate has been proven many times to be a DPS increase along with shadow bolt spam.
---
&gt; because they prefer it for whatever reason.
---
Again you don't need to worry about that, the people who like to min/max do it because they like to min max they operate with no other biases. The best of the best got to be the best by doing what ever is most optimal. If tomorrow someone proposes a method that allowed enhancement shamans to put out the most threat you would see people adapt. 
---
Also it doesn't require full reevaluation because it's not that big of a change. The core mechanics will remain in tact it is a simple value that changes. The people who figured out fury tanking was the best did so through lots of research and testing and understanding of the game. They are the exact type of people who can look at the differences such as this increase to parry chance and figure out how much and exactly what it will impact. I'm in a few discord channels these guys frequent they literally make a career out of theory crafting the game.
---
This is pretty important to point out if someone is planning on doing this as a mage, warlock, etc
---
Exactly this. I can't wait for Classic, but the reality is that most people still won't want it after a few months, which is why things got changed in the first place. It's a niche game, and there's nothing wrong with that. And honestly, one of the bigger turn-offs for people when it comes to classic will be the community itself, unless people finally give up the victim complex.
---
All raiding guilds are progression guilds, and these guilds can clear naxx with a boomkin.
---
And that's really it. 
---
It makes no sense to then state the obvious that guilds trying for server first will be more selective
---
I will be indeed. Have only ever rolled one alliance and that lasted 3 levels. Will HYU closer to release!
---
No one can prove anything here *except* we are getting WoW Classic.
---
As I said, preservation of the game come as a priority. If it's fun or not (or if people want it in a way or the other) should never override the basic objective: re-create Classic as faithfully as possible.
---
&gt; World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original World of Warcraft—it runs a bit smoother on today’s computers, but the game still looks and feels like you’re playing World of Warcraft from 2006. Combat mechanics, original character models and skill trees all contribute to a truly authentic experience, as do your interactions with other players. Your reliance on others to take on the world was at the heart of the original WoW and is at the heart of World of Warcraft Classic.
---
Lol at tbc being “better”
---
Fucking tbc babies
---
I saw one guy with 187g a few days ago. Playing the AH is a ton of fun, I plan to do it a lot.
---
Wind serpents are pretty nice for the ranged nature damage against warriors especially. If you have a very recognizably fast pet like broken tooth of later on ZG pet good warlocks will toss out a curse of weakness on it though.  Bats/Owls are pretty sweet because -100 AP isn't shabby at all, especially in earlier phases.
---
launch of wotlk to the second raid tier was a race to see who could kill 25H KT and unsub first.  in other words it was basically a wintergrasp chat simulator 6 nights of the week.
---
best I could tell...
---
RPPVP was basically just a PvP server will less stupid names and a bit of ERP in some of the inns.
---
Other than that basically just a PvP server with less stopid names.
---
&gt; Two, retail is being sold while people play on free, non-retail, servers and that's where the term originated.
---
That will be your last lesson. By the way do NOT put that you're fluent in English on anything. You will fuck up any company that relies on your mastery of the language and they will lose a lot of money because of your inept grasp of the language. Sorry for the harsh language but I want to drive home how bad the mishap will be.
---
To reiterate, I am in no way agreeing with you because what you've stated is objectively false. Specifically this ignorant comment
---
&gt;which is strange because wow isn't really a retail product? it's service is being provided/ sold directly to customers from it's creators, 
---
See, 
---
Also, 
---
&gt;So not only is the word retail being used wrongly,
---
The word IS not being used wrongly, if anything it WILL BE used "wrongly". (a better word than "wrongly" here is incorrectly). You can find info on verb tenses [here](https://leo.stcloudstate.edu/grammar/tenses.html)
---
I hope you've understood all of my verbiage. I really hope you continue your studies dude, you're getting there but you're far from fluent. I know I said last time was the last English lesson but I couldn't help myself, o beginner student of the English language. :-)
---
Yeah we'll see about that...
---
It's not so bad here! And things are getting better everyday. Going horde?
---
oh man, now I need to find him..
---
When I said 75 that was per player. Of course it depends on market pricing and luck of drops. One time we went 3 lockouts without an arcane crystal and once we got 3 in an hour so the money you make varies but it was definitely the best gold I could make as a healer and probably the best gold the fury could make.
---
I mean then you can keep playing the trash that bfa and retail is. You and your friends are the kinds of people who ruined this game. If you had faster leveling and LFD the game would drop off even faster... Theres many reasons wows sub numbers have gone down so much over the years and why blizzard can't use their sub count as a way to advertise their game. At one point they could say "We have 14 million subscribers!". Now its less than half of that. Its been at a steady decrease for years now. Its currently less than it was 9 months after vanilla launch. Let that sink in.
---
yeah , its certainly an interesting discussion
---
blizzard seems to want it to be a black box and not really talk about the fine details of how the layer system works
---
how it works is pretty important we have seen mobs phasing in on people plenty of times but no word if theh can fix that. 
---
we have also seen people from totally different servers get on other layers, this indicates there is 2 types of layers 
---
type 1) split players on 1 server as expected
---
type 2) totally different server players who are actually on the same server but on layers never intended to mix (im sure they never wanted us to see that)
---
i think the community concern about how it actually works is pretty low because  its not supposed to be around forever.
---
if i had closed access id play around and try and test but really only streamers like asmon even have the people to try and figure out exactly how it works.
---
id love to test type 2 lag, like if goldshire was lagging on stress is it lagging on closed beta, that would tell us some things
---
Reminds me of a quote I saw recently which unfortunately I don't remember who said it...  
---
"The best arguments aren't when you're right, it's when there's progress"
---
What a terrible troll attempt. 1/10 bad b8
---
what unit does azeroth use?
---
I think that classic feels way more like a world than any other xpac. BC is just the best expansion by far.
---
More TBC crap, what a shock.
---
Well let's take the ones you listed as examples.  
---
\- Personally I don't have a huge issue with transmog, however I wish it was an option for people to either enable or disable transmog (so if you disable it, even people with their gear transmogged, you only see the original gear). However, I would not want to see this in Classic, because the gear back in the day looked so different and unique that you didn't need transmog at all. It was also a sign of achievement. What does a full Tier 2.5 mean nowadays as a transmog that you can literally farm out in 1 reset?  
---
\- Flying mounts, from a pure QoL standpoint, I never minded on PvE realms that much, but I did on PvP ones. Basically what it did, is instead of making the whole World dangerous, only certain zones that were popular became the danger-zones. However, for both PvE and PvP, traversing the World on foot had an unique feeling to it. Remember every time you rode up to the entrance of Blackrock Mountains? Every. Time. It felt epic. Also, another thing is for the RP servers. There is a lot more natural activity if people are confined to the ground.
---
\- AOE looting… without shared loot this is a bad idea. Even the grey items have a serious weight to them, because you need money, and if some cuck can just ninja all of it away with 1 click, it doesnt feel nice. Be fast and loot first my man.
---
\- I'm actually thankful that Sharding will be a thing for launch. To this day I still have severe anxiety attacks from Diablo3 release.
---
\- Dual Spec just because fuck paying 50 gold every single time for a respec. People might say that "ermahgerd you just get to change during raids whenever you want and its not authentic" nibba there are plenty of hybrid specs that work. Just look at fury tanks, or holy rets as an example. Paying 1k gold for a dual spec would be much better for everyone, sanity wise.  
---
\- RDF, LFR and Group Finder… Out of the three, Group Finder is the only thing that doesn't ruin the game, not even by a single bit. RDF and LFR just puts you together in a braindead dungeon with completely unknown people that you won't talk to ever (and also, the max level experience is literally sitting in your main Capital and spamming it). Group Finder has a lot more interaction, you can go ahead and gather materials while sitting in Group Finder, the people in your group share a common goal, there is a much bigger chance for player interaction (especially on Classic where there are no cross-realm shit going on).
---
\- Another major one I can think of are Heirlooms. Currently heirlooms make an already braindead easy leveling even more braindead and easy. What they should do instead, is: remove the heirloom mount, remove all the other heirlooms as well, and introduce heirloom shirts and tabards that you can upgrade to give more XP. That way you make the leveling experience faster, but get to keep difficulty - if there are any left in Retail. Also, with the current heirlooms, there is no point in gear progression, which is one of the most fun things about the game in general. For me, who played Vanilla for a long time, I say my idea of heirlooms would work with Vanilla without making everyone mad, even the #nochanges crowd.
---
I wouldn’t say that. It’s more that classic characters are meant to be unique individuals with their own stories and achievements. Instead of the player being rewarded account-wide, the character itself is rewarded for what they have done. This is much more immersive in my opinion.
---
It would seem extremely counter intuitive and time wasting to spend time playing both and keep up with them. Who would wanna put themselves through that.
---
Oh, sweet!
---
i found the folders after looking through 7 hard drives. where do i upload them?
---
Retail went full speed downhill right after diablo 3 because the wow team absorbed the entire Diablo 3 team.
---
It’s why the game is so shit today.
---
i remember if you keep doing random eventually you ran out, but could still random and do heroics, this might of been earlier on when it was introduced cuz i remember getting full  t7 and 8 really quickly. 
---
t9 was fast too
---
Imagine being as angry as you. I'd probably complain all day too. And write things like "hahahahahaha" so people reading my comment think im laughing and having a great time. Also im not even the person you were arguing with dude! You just got confused among your literal hundreds of reddit comments made this week, and are blinded by your seething anger.
---
STOP FEEDING AND GO IN AS A TEAM
---
Yeah when I was a kid.  I don't remember much about it honestly lol
---
this is why they just need to start a new path after classic.
---
Are you going to play Horde?
---
I was not scared because my faithful tank and guild master had been here twice already this week and was 2h tanking since he was so damn good at being a warrior already!
---
Wands were like 1g20s buyout on alliance side last night.
---
&gt;Buff/debuff timers
---
&gt;The game has some commands that allow you the get information about the buffs/debuffs on a certain unit, for example Unitaura. However, pre 2.0 this command did not return anything else than 0 for values such as spell duration and expiration time, this seems to work as intended on classic and I personally haven't found any ways to get any unintended information about these timers.
---
Differences like these aren't small, especially in PvP
---
I like meeting people and I love coffee. Keen? Also which faction? That'll decide everything
---
Pserver warriors on suicide watch
---
I'm pretty sure it actually reads the combat log "X started casting 'Y spell'" and uses the recorded casting time for that spell and displays it. It isn't perfect though, since it might assume Corruption has a cast time when 99% of the time it will be talented to be instant, and it won't be able to do the difference between 1.0s talented r1 frostbolts and 2.5s talented max rank frostbolts.
---
Iron that flag.....and then burn it you Alliance scum!
---
i agree, flying in outland is fine. I actually remember going on to the random floating boulders.
---
Id duel there often
---
It's bigger size shards and not dynamic.
---
A shard is a small area and you get dynamically phased to another shard based on how many players there are
---
Layering : The whole continent is one shard=a layer, you don't get phased to another layer unless you group with someone from another layer.
---
WoW Classic is basically WoW2. Change my mind
---
The only rep grind I didn't like in TBC was The Keepers Of Time. Just because you could either do Dark Portal which was boring as fuck or Old Hillsbrad which took forever with almost no mobs. The rest I thought was fine.
---
Probably wiped the first two or three times we did this. If I remember correctly it was a shitty walk back if you took too long bc the mobs respawned.
---
People on here are quite hostile towards any changes for a couple reasons, firstly most changes on their own aren't bad but with each change you get closer to retail which many of just don't find fun and secondly threads like this one have been posted countless times and most people want to shut them down hard so that Blizzard doesn't get the impression that we would be fine with any changes.
---
Sweet! Sounds good if you're keen. Will be good to chat about it. No one I know is into it.
---
"all spec playable and don't force you on 1 spec"
---
My comment has nothing to do with mages vs warlocks.
---
I sure as hell will. And I bet you are going to play too. Yeah, you, wow classic redditor reading this. You will play Diablo Immortal, admit it. And while I'm here, I bet the next 100 days before classic is released is THE MOST EXCITING Part of classic. Once it's released, every will grind for 2 weeks then complain that there is nothing to do at level 60. Just watch, not even 100 days into release, most of classic's fan base will turn its back and leave. You will go back to debating with yourself what character to play, your main 120 or your classic. You might even consider another game. Nah, I guess I'll just log on classic and sit in Stormwind. I wonder why my guildies don't sign on anymore. Where has everyone gone? Blizzard this is all your fault. Of course, it's not my fault, I know what I want, but Blizzard is soOoOo out of touch with their fans. I almost thought they were going to make a complete 180 after the last 4 years of wow have been shit. I really thought blizzard was going to make it a better pile of shit. Nope, Blizzard will fail you again, morons. Quote me on this: not even 100 days into release and everyone will be shitting all over classic with pitch forks in the air, ready to stomp on Blizzard's doorstep. Then you know what will happen? Hmm... Maybe I'll go play some Diablo Immortal. Blizzard has all of you by the balls and you don't even know it. They look at their fans like a pile of fucking mold on a sandwich which only purpose is to reproduce, or in this case, consume.
---
I don’t disagree with your opinion, just the support points that have no actual weight behind them.
---
This sub has the worst trolls. Its like they're literally stuck in 2004
---
From what I'm reading it adds 5 points, so you would essentially be lvl31.
---
Oh god - I was a tank back then. Jumped into the group of mobs and wiped.
---
Hunter and his pet's last seconds after a nuclear attack.
---
TBC &gt; Vanilla &gt; Legion &gt; WotLK
---
TBC wins because of class balance and 25-man raiding. 40-man raiding was great, but sometimes it becomes more about logistics than actually playing the game.
---
Fucking meta
---
Yep
---
Is their hitbox supposed to be that fucking massive where they can hit you from 10 yards away with a melee swing?
---
10 yards is 9.14 meters
---
He is mistaken, it's only one level not three.  So it's a passive +5 to stealth which means a Lv30 nelf would have 155.  Here is a great resource for stealth numbers!
---
https://shadowpanther.net/stealth.htm
---
It depends on what you like I think. Afaik MoP had every class being able to do so much stuff. Which some people don't like, they prefer more niche and unique classes. But that also meant that MoP had pretty much every class being fun, interesting and engaging to play. Which is definitely not true in later expansions, *cough* BfA *cough*. And in comparison was also somewhat the case in TBC. Not that TBC was terrible in that regard, but it still had a lot of vanilla issues of the "base" gameplay being clunky and simple. But in PvP there's so many small things that you can do and that matters, so it's a much smaller issue than in PvE (warlocks are not just spamming shadowbolt in PvP for example...).
---
Tanks may not produce as much less as you're thinking though.
---
Sure parry will block more but it also means tanks take more hits from parry-haste.
---
They'll need more healing, as a result, but it will also mean more rage to work with which will make up that initial threat deficit.
---
One more impactful thing is that Fury-prot tanking that everyone's been fawning over will likely be far more difficult to pull off. It may simply proc far too much parry that it's no longer as viable.
---
The portion of the playerbase who min-max will be vastly outnumbered by those who don't. After launch, I doubt the average player will even know this was a discussion.
---
From 1.10:  Slice and Dice - This ability can no longer be blocked, dodged, or parried, and cannot miss. If you attempt to use this ability when your target is dead, you will now receive an error message instead of displaying the spell animations.
---
Also makes it harder for the hunter to get far enough away to actually use their bow. So its counterproductive to be a tauren hunter.
---
We don't really know the procrate. Private servers have used all kinds of procrates over the years, some meant human warriors with it were amazing all the way in AQ, some it was only really good for mc/bwl. It is definitely useful no matter what the actual procrate was. As for farming it I don't think it's that low, on pservers it's something like 0.5-2% ish. Especially useful for human tanks
---
For PVP I don't think it's been used much. Mace spec is really not good for rogue because A) it's in combat tree which is shit for pvp and B) It's unreliable procs that will mess with your stun DR's.
---
According to the orb of deception, trolls are the dwarves of the horde after all
---
That sounds awesome! I'm glad people have done that. Would be amazing to have people hype it up and someone announces for each match.
---
IBS is Ice Barb Spear
---
I remember my first time at this event. 
---
I was tanking in a guild group, and one of us in the group had done a full ZF run at that point. 
---
I think we wiped once or twice before we had it completed. Was a great experience
---
Yep. Best way to earn money, although it can be risky. Pay attention to the prices and avalibility, see what's profitable. Buy low, sell high. You'll earn 100g long before you're 40.
---
Don't worry about that, plenty of people are apparently still wiping in dungeons on the Beta servers.
---
There's a difference between watching Streamers with BiS at level 30 and your average joe that is just leveling.
---
&gt; ONSLAUGHT where you literally just get kicked if you don't perform perfectly
---
This doesn't happen.
---
When I hear this stuff, I can't help but thinking a better solution would be to remove armor entirely and have the stats be based on some kind non-visual gear. Then people can just create their character however they want, complete with outfits.
---
I understand collecting transmogs is fun for some people though. Again, I feel like it would be better to have cosmetic items to collect for fun and have stats be based off non-visual gear.
---
I just like knowing that people are wearing what they are actually wearing you know. I'd rather see people wearing their actual armor and knowing what it's worth, or just have stats based off something else and make armor completely cosmetic (in a different game. Keep classic wow the same).
---
Let him have all the spirit gear, take all the int/stam gear. You'll have a priest battery on top of life tap, so you don't necessarily need it.
---
The bigger thing to watch IMO is that you're both very reliant (while leveling) on getting last hits, locks with drain soul and priests with spirit tap. I'd let the priest last hit as much as possible, since he can fuel you easily with vampiric embrace. Also, you are both very heavy on dots and extremely tanky, so pulling multiple mobs whenever possible will save a ton of time and be more mana efficient. With the amount of fears between the two of you, plus VW tank, you could probably juggle 3 mobs non-stop until you clear an area.
---
You haven't answered, what is your solution ? If you make too many servers they will end up empty quickly since most of the playerbase on launch will be curious tourists.
---
Do you want to merge the servers after ? It would be the same as layering and layering avoids players stacking in one server and crashing it.
---
Make the servers have insane pop caps ? you will need an extreme dynamic respawn to make it playable, and it is very expensive.
---
I don't really care about insults coming from you. I don't respect you enough to care about your opinion. Wrath was better than both vanilla and TBC and that will be true regardless of how much autism you put into your (lack of) arguments
---
Oh man, I forgot about at bug. I remember that happening at least twice. Absolutely rage inducing.
---
Black Friday Stormwind. Linen Cloth and Stormwind Brie 50% off.
---
I mean there's plenty of active realms. the game isn't dying or even close to it. It's just bad compared to itself and especially after such a successful legion xpac that was so we'll received.
---
It's still good.
---
Dang I thought mages had elemental in vanilla. Whoops, at least we still have sheep.
---
that's what I like to read :D
---
So you dont care about the spirit of no changes, just technically. Thats fine, but i disagree what no changes really means in terms of how we experience the game.
---
And dont be a smartass? Alright dude. Were discussing video games here, relax.
---
If it looks interesting try it out, don't let other people decide for you.
---
But it hasn't been proven wrong. The "you think you do" has been proven right so far. We can't know the second part until people actually play
---
Vael and Ony you fight near the back leg.  The game thinks you are behind and you don't get hit by tail sweeps or parried.
---
Also, less toxic trolls. The community on RP servers tends to drive incels back to Illidan or KT
---
“Isn’t someone i’d like to help out.”???? A group invite is mutually beneficial...you’re both helping each other out. why is it rude for someone to want to help you get the tag when theres other people waiting there to steal it from you... Asking before joining a group doesn’t happen unless it happens on RP servers or something that i dont know about... but in the 12+ years ive played wow i cant remember a single time someone has messaged me beforehand or  asked if its ok for them to send an invite...this is absolutely absurd snowflake mentality.

I used to sell tons of stacks of stringy wolf meat for 5-10g/stk. People would snatch it all up to level their cooking. Fishing for stacks of Oily Blackmouth for alchemists to make free action potion was huge also. Just had to travel a bit. Then I would just buy and sell twink items off AH too. People who didn't know any better would put something like Feet of the Lynx up for 5g, I'd buy it and sell it for market price which could be anywhere from 50g to 200g (give or take).
---
Thats what I'm so confused about. I NEVER said in my post I wanted any of these changes... I said "I want to be excited for Classic WoW. Please explain to me why you guys are excited for Classic WoW despite not having these QoL features."
---
The whole mother fucking point of Classic WoW is so that it WONT be changed you stupid shits...I perfectly understand that.  Thats why I'm excited for it. I'll get to experience the Vanilla WoW everyone is always talking about and is nostalgic for. 
---
I never experienced it. I want to understand why the Classic Community is excited for it. Fuck these trolls.
---
Why are you even here? Seriously how pathetic can you be, arguing with people you feel superior than in an online forum. The fact that you think you're better than everyone here is fuckin laughable. Im honestly so glad I'm not you, and I really don't mean that in jest.
---
I recommend playing whatever you like
---
BM hunters are a joy to play
---
hunters can hold their own in PvP
---
I think the various pet mechanics are fun personally
---
In my humble opinion it was bad for many reasons:  It removes people from the "world" in that it teleports you to dungeons instead of having to walk.  Many people just stand in cities and spam LFG these days.  You don't have to communicate/coordinate w/ people to to form the group.  Instances in LFG are easier, so it also requires less communications/coordination to complete the instance.  It's kinda anonymous, you'll likely never see these people again - which gives some people the freedom to be evil to other players w/o the consequence of destroying their reputation.
---
If you ask the retards here who say classic should be the uncompromised experience, the yeah. This shouldn't be fixed.
---
These are the people who thinks that the shadow effects should be the same... Idiots
---
That is awesome, I bet it was hectic but memorable.
---
It's also lets the fans know that Blizzard hates everyone who isn't a streamer.
---
is there not a decent amount of overlap?
---
The trinket won't be available before phase2. And it's in the vanilla state where you can't remove any kind of CC, each class has specific things that they can remove. 
---
Hunter freezing trap does have DR's yes.
---
What? What I am saying has not changed at any point. If you are going to be dishonest like that then this conversation is over.
---
I very clearly said there is a bug in the Classic beta that makes FD not work sometimes. This is an objective fact. This has nothing to do with the possibility of enemies resisting it, if that happened it would say "Resist" above the enemy. This does not happen when it glitches out, it literally doesn't cast FD at all sometimes due to the bug. It just refuses to.
---
Hey! I started playing in Vanilla!
---
TBC was better!
---
For awhile that's sort of how it was with having to go back to Azeroth for the AH and class skills I think. As the patches came out there more things added to Shatt from what I remember, with a main thing being the portal back and forth from Isle of Quel'danas. 
---
 I didn't play in Vanilla but played from about 6 months into TBC to now. Outland was such a cool place because it really did feel otherworldly and felt like it was a journey to go back to Azeroth or vice versa. I think part of that feeling was from knowing my friends at max level were way off in some far away place I couldn't go to.
---
&gt; Tokens for Tier Gear
---
This was added in AQ, and used in Naxx and all of BC.
---
Yesterday I was buying strange dust from the enchanter trainer and he only offered 3. I needed 10. 
---
I just kept relogging and he would have more. Now idk if that was because I kept landing on different layers or if it was because that's just how npcs work. 
---
Either way I got my lvl 5 wand for my priest.
---
You tried to do the whooosh, but it was you that got whooshed all along
---
Unless it's buffing dungeons so they're more like pservers lol. Then you get upvoted. People are fraudulent morons.
---
There will be some Pally and warrior overlap for sure. Not a ton though. Pally will get the benefit of wearing cloth and leather as well which is nice. And there are the class quests we can all do to get something shiney. I think it will be ok overall.
---
I found a screenshot of my rogue from 2005. I really like the way they look as they get better gear, with my favorite set being nightslayer.

All 3 were great games that really stood on their own, emphasizing different aspects of WoW. Vanilla was just the best at creating a giant constant world that you felt like you lived in. TBC fixed class design and took 5mans and raiding to a whole new level. WotLK really pushed the narrative quality of the game thanks to the Lich King/Arthas storyline and how that was communicated in-game. WotLK probably had the best version of structured WoW pvp ever. 
---
I'm not sure if a blend of all 3 would work, since what is good about vanilla and wotlk feel pretty much at odds. However a blend of Vanilla and TBC, with the vanilla world, but TBC class, 5 man, and raid mechanics, would be freaking epic. But that's not the way Blizz is going, oh well.
---
I'll play it for 10 minutes before realizing this game isn't meant for me because I'm not a gambling addict and then delete it like I do literally every new game I see in the App Store
---
/panic
---
&gt;My realm is extremely active on retail and I’m never bored. 
---
There could be 1000 people playing the game and your server would still feel "extremely active". The sharding system will give that illusion as long as there's some player somewhere in any particular area.
---
White room existed and was a throwback to the infamous "cat rooms" in Everquest, hotboxes where GMs could potentially stick you if you were being disruptive that were otherwise normally inaccessible aside from a few infamous bugged occasions. In reality they never saw much use. The "cat room" name came from the walls of one (or several?) of these rooms having cat textures all over the walls.
---
I doubt the white room was ever used for this purpose and was likely an inside dev joke and nod to the cat rooms.
---
YouTube launched only a few months after Patch 1.0. I personally used it myself in Vanilla to look up videos in later, more difficult raids than MC. Guides did in fact exist for every raid encounter and every meaningful boss encounter. Thottbot and WoWHead alone were enough to crowdsource information even without that. I don't know how you don't know these things existed then, unless you simply weren't looking for them.
---
Rhok delar from MC, there’s a epic quiver quest off of one of the world bosses?
---
It still seems pointless. What happens if the server ends up with too many or too few people when they decide to end layering? It's still going to lead to mergers and/or transfers.
---
Trolololol
---
Do shadow heals next!
---
Good dungeon to run and was very useful for levels in tanaris, actually pretty good experience around tanaris, zf.  although the world pvp there was brutal but fun AF!
---
It was one of the driving factors of the GAME honestly...how many more times did scarlet monastary get run because of people collecting matching red armor
---
Data mining killed all of this fun. Also, they got rid of stutter step wall climbing. No more, Scaling the bank pillers in IF ect.
---
Exactly, plus on a pvp server we can decent the gatherer and pull the next mob until gatherer catches up.
---
No, gear = time spent. I love classic, but let's not pretend gearing up was anything but mindless grinding, be it raids or bgs.
---
I logged in last night for the stress test and I was so captivated with my character I forgot to eat dinner. 
---
Classic wow is great, I recommend it to anyone that enjoys RPGs
---
Trinkets will be available in Phase 2 (Dire Maul). Blizzard plans a quick release of this, probably no more than 2 months.
---
Freezing Trap has diminishing returns.
---
Not even close to richest. Someone on the pvp server had almost 200 last week.
---
Wrath had a lot of features I really enjoyed and that was when i was at the height of my guild leader days, so I think back fondly to then.
---
This sounds awesome. Have fun boys!
---
I don't think it's a bug with the guild window, you can't interact with the people who don't have a zone listed.
---
Because the end game is defined by the player, and most people define end game as raids and M+
---
Hey, the shoulder roll is kinda sexy.
---
Dont be pedantic. Both the quality and quantity of the assets we have now are light years better than Thottbot and death metal overlayed videos of Ragnaros kills.
---
Yes they can, invis pots and mind soothe
---
Idk about all that other stuff but Outlands is specifically designed with flying in mind a wouldnt work without it. Many areas you can only get to by flying
---
I think a better rework would be something like how Flight worked in Aion, where it's a limited duration thing and you can get some stuff to improve on that. This would eliminate a lot of the problems having an on/off indefinite Flying creates while maintaining the ability to create more vertical zones to take advantage of it.
---
Hi, /u/throwawaylemons12345
---
Where did you get those wallpapers?
---
To my knowledge, it's BiS for fury warriors for a long time, same as Hand of Justice. Extra attack procs are better for them than spell damage procs or similar effects because it's more rage generation and an extra chance to crit and proc Flurry (and probably a Crusader enchant).
---
The proc is effectively a permanent multiplicative attack speed buff, except it improves further with instant attacks as well.
---
everything but the water... like that LQ vanilla water
---
Imp SWP is essential, I promise. Especially so when you pull two mobs and want to dot both down
---
And I wonder why I rarely visit this Reddit anymore.
---
It's dead Jim.
---
You should report this, NPCs definitely don't refill their inventory  when you dc. 
---
It could be a layering issue
---
That is great news. I was looking for that info just the other day. Any chance you have a link or could point me in the right direction of the blue post confirming the quick release of phase 2?
---
Spot on mate.
---
I'm in the same boat dude! =( 3 young kids, full-time job, and a wife who hates video games.... I'm screwed.
---
I remember fearing shit and getting half the instance running up the stairs at us.
---
True, I should have clarified. I meant the tokens you got for doing heroics being tradable for the previous tier set.
---
I'd rather have layering vs more servers that need to be merged after the initial rush is over.
---
I used to date this girl that was deeply addicted to wow. She was on disability for a bad back and played wow almost all day everyday from vanilla to wotlk.  She was an awesome player at the game but her real life was a disaster, her kid was getting kicked out of school, she could barely keep up with rent, her house was a mess and her health was going down the drain. 
---
Together we completed the lich king raid and after that she swore to never play wow again. I agreed that she should stay away and try to get her life in order.
---
Years later.....I contacted here after hearing about the classic announcement. I asked if she wanted to join a P server with me to practice and get ready for classic. Fastest NOPE ever from her. She got a new job moved to a new house, her kid joined soccer and has been gaming free for years now. No games at all, she said they all just hook her in to much and the rewards trump anything she could achieve in real life that quickly. 
---
Anyway moral to the story. You are right, there are people out there that really don't want classic wow back because they had a rough time getting away from the game in the first place.
---
Thanks man, I know these posts are kind of redundant here but I just needed to share.
---
Idk, looks more like he slipped on a banana peel
---
i think one thing that flying did that we can all agree on,
---
it made AFK'ing out in the world too safe. I think a simple fix is that your mount slowly sinks over time while you are not making any movement inputs, similar to how the banshee works in halo
---
It wouldn’t ruin the experience. That’s literally how classic was.
---
&gt;  As such, Orc resists a bunch of grenades, which makes their advantage even bigger in serious PvP!
---
Really? I thought orcs could not resist incapacitates they way they resist stun. Is this confirmed for live or is this just a pserver thing?
---
Ulduar will always be my favorite raid. First time main tanking for a guild and every fight was a total blast. Never got to see Algernon though (sorry if misspelled)
---
Having dungeons be easy for those that put a crap ton of effort into their play style and character is the point. It's a reward for going above and beyond. If you want truly difficult content then you need to grind all the way to doing AQ40 and Naxx. That's really why they made those instances so difficult in the first place.
---
A higher skill floor just means more people will be participating in high end content. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
I think it was because of layering but I'll report it tonight when I get on.
---
Where do you get 2 minutes from?
---
It's 3 minutes in Vanilla. You're either trolling or should now pretend you're trolling because you're way out of your depth on this topic.
---
should be available here

This happened to me once, managed to blink up the mountain, threw a fireball at the boss and ran back out over the walls to finish the darn thing. 5/7 would do again... Was kinda fun
---
I asked an in-game question last night and people took it the wrong way and were angry at me, so I thought I would try it here. Is it helpful for us to spam log-in attempts when the server is down? Does a server tech need that to happen or do they want us out of the way?
---
Not completely true. Priests are the only dispel horde side so any priest spec will get invites. Alliance has paladins which are the best pvp healers in the game with the best dispel, priests get squeezed out a bit there.
---
That won't change at 120.  Dungeon Finder groups don't talk, and the object is to get through the instance in the least amount of time, with the least amount of hassle, so you can move on.
---
WoW *as it currently stands* is built around max level content.  Running the same zones over and over again to level a new class to max level (where the content is) can get somewhat tedious after you've done it 5 times.  
---
The other avenue is paying $60 for a level boost to 120.  At least the people in the heirloom gear are playing the game to get to 120, instead of just literally buying it.
---
I've said time and time again that you can alleviate EVERY exploitable aspect of layering without impacting game play by making layer switches only happen when you get in the same zone as the other person/people in your group and make zone chats layer specific.
---
Aw shit I forgot that was a thing

"he naxx revamp was widely loved." Except it was cleaned day one in greens and caused lots of raiders to quit. Especially since ulduar didn't come 2 months afterwards, but later.
---
2nd favorite dungeon behind BRD. Stairs event was epic. I tried so many times to complete my Sul'thraze! I only ever got Sang'thraze.
---
Well, not really. If it was client-side only then it would be entirely optional, but in the modern game I don't have a choice as to whether I can see your fake gear or not.
---
Nah. I know most of them by heart.
---
pretty sure thats the standard debuff notification. 
---
rezzing at the spirit healer gives you a debuff.
---
If the ship to Theramore is there you can take it and jump of before the loading screen its even faster
---
Do you mean outside of stormwind?
---
Omg I haven’t heard that shit in forever. 😂😂😂
---
Could he be wrong about it being the stress test and not the beta?
---
Well first of all we will be getting 16 debuff slots at launch which certainly helps.
---
The issue with shadowpriests is really that you can't bring more than one to a raid without severely gimping both of them. Just about every guild will have exactly one shadowpriest. If you can play the shadowpriest well and keep a near 100% attendance on main raid days I promise you'll find a guild very quick. 
---
Also take a look at the content that will be available at the start. It's pretty much MC and Onyxia, these raids don't need 40 min-maxers to complete. You could probably clear them with 40 paladins or druids. So it doesn't really matter if you do bad dps.

What dwarves and gnomes?
---
Sure, if you say so.
---
if they learn to do layering on a per zone basis it would be able to stay active for the entire six seasons.  They cannot layer zones where there are world bosses and the other zones could be layered.  new servers and free character transfers happened through out 1.1 to 1.12.  the difference is they can merge the servers after midnight, and create new ones during prime time hours just in time.  Instead of it taking a few weeks or a month of announcing a date and telling people to prepare for the changes.

&gt; Wow needs to build laterally not vertically
---
I feel the same way. I quit soon after BC launched. I had just hit lvl 60 maybe a month prior and having all that wiped away really made me lose interest in the game. I realized leveling up and constantly hunting for gear each time they launched a new xpac would become the majority of the game and I didn't like that at all. Felt like a rat race. I just wanted to PvP on an even playing field and do fun dungeons. 
---
I came back in Cata, bought a level up to 80, and pretty much hit 85 doing nothing but battle grounds and LFG 5 mans. Then MoP dropped, all my PvP gear was useless again, and I felt that feeling of rat race coming back. Quit soon after. 
---
I'd like to be motivated by new content, not the feeling I need new gear to be competent.
---
Not me, I used to LOVE fighting other twinks. I really enjoyed the challenge.
---
Appears so. Lot of ppl attacking me personally for having the audacity to suggest the game is now slightly easier with the modern internet at our disposal. Oh well.

---
SWTOR doesn't call it layering (I don't know *what* they call it) but they've had a similar function since the early days if not launch. It's effectively layering.
---
Imperial Fleet is full, so it creates an instanced copy, calls it Imperial Fleet 2, and overflowing players logging/zoning in will spawn in this layer instead of overcrowding Imperial Fleet 1. This layer fills up, so it creates Imperial Fleet 3, and overflowing players will now spawn in this layer. They are sort of instanced apart from one another. You don't see players from other layers, but they all share the same chat so you can communicate with your guild, party, and people in general/trade/etc across layers.
---
You can also transfer to a different layer. Sometimes you log into Imperial Fleet and it's crowded and you're lagging, so you open your map to see if there's an Imperial Fleet 2 you can join and hope it has fewer players so you don't have choppy frames.
---
These players are all still from *your server*. They are not sharded in from other servers or anything like that. Additionally as population in a given layered area decreases, layers begin to disperse and close down. They aren't open all the time, they only exist in response to some server-side population threshold.
---
I see a lot of confusion about layering, and I think Blizz assumed people were familiar with it. I agree they need to better explain, especially if their layering model works differently from examples we may know about.
---
Those 10 servers aren't physical servers (at least they shouldn't be). They are just naming conventions used in a virtual environments. Back in vanilla, the choice of server made a huge difference in the gameplay. Layering and sharding are just stupid names Blizzard made up to con people into thinking removing dedicated hardware servers was a gameplay decision rather than an economic one.
---
For instance, low pop servers were amazing to level on and quest with, but you really needed a good guild to raid and do dungeons. You definitely did NOT want to walk somewhere and wait 3 hours at the entrance of a dungeon trying to band together a marginal group with a tank and healer. Classic WoW... don't worry about it, you'll always have the right number of people in your "layer".
---
Some people will like that, some won't... but it certainly isn't even close to vanilla.
---
edgemasters even bis-ier
---
You take that back, ST was the best. Look what they did to my boy in retail!

Joana has done sub 100 hour runs. 96 hours I think.

Vanilla player here. It wouldn't please me at all, because it's changing the game. I wonder if the people breaking ranks and asking for dungeons to be buffed will be receptive to a pass on the indefensible state of class balance? Somehow I think not.
---
I thought beta was just early access that favored streamers and spitefully snubbed vanilla beta and launch vets.
---
honestly all 3 are great in it's own way. vanilla is chaos it tells you nothing and at the time no help outside asking chat really existed. even today the wowhead etc. can't contain depth of vanilla in how systems works.
---
TBC is where blizzard took vanilla and pointed it towards a goal you kinda knew what you wanted to do and game got you going that path. in many ways TBC is a vanilla+ or a "we kinda got vanilla balanced and understood"
---
WotLK however early on is where blizzard really nailed down raiding and a balance of the casual enjoying the world the person wishing for more and a goal. to this day ulduar is still the best raid i have ever had the pleasure to beat my face into. it has everything a "secret" last boss, a seemingly impossible old god encounter, branching paths and choises in order, a unique set of encounters that overall demanded every one in the raid be really skilled at one point or an other.
---
however each and every one of these experiances can only exist on it's own as each thing demands sacrifices to be made for it to exist. you can't have ulduar raiding with the chaos balancing of vanilla and TBC where the class could be demanded skill be damned. you can't have the utter chaos and social aspect of vanilla if you point people towards goals.
---
Had 5 heal spec pallies do this once..
---
It was like the weirdest game of whack a mole you ever saw.
---
They ganked lowbies and harrassed people their level.
---
Even a full out raid wasn't able kill to more than one of them at a time.
---
Whoops. Thanks for correcting
---
I think in theory these are good ideas, but I don't know how you can continue to make progression in the game after Naxx gear. Stats were getting pretty out of control at that point, so adding raids above it will get ridiculous fast. But if you don't, then the incentive is gone.
---
I mentioned this in another thread, but I think they could start doing some things similar to Destiny where gear/items in new content helps you in that content specifically. It feels sort of artificially gating depending on how it's done, but I think the base idea could be used somehow.
---
Because looking up "Move away when you're the bomb in the Vael fight" is somehow more difficult when gleaned through Thottbot than it is when gleaned through a 720p video of a pserver?
---
You can think whatever you want about difficulty of games. I reiterate that if it's so important to you to equalize the scales, then play without gear. You're perfectly entitled to handicap yourself on purpose for the sake of an extra challenge, as is anyone else who thinks things are just too easy. Since you have a 0% chance of ever making me think anything other than \#nochanges and I suspect I have a 0% of making you think that game difficulty is separate from individual player capacity, I bid you good day.
---
How is not one person jumping? Also, think about all the gnomes/dwarves you can't see.
---
Undead warlock baby
---
I think food was an issue too, as the bats only ate fruit and fruit wasn’t easily farmable like meat is for BT.
---
Fuckin thank you lol. This shit is being driven by pserver players, plain and simple. Maybe some of them will stay open if that's the game they want. 
---
I want Vanilla, not a private server.
---
This. Read it. Then read it again.
---
&gt; The last picture is literally the first picture with the gaps filled in with simulated colors
---
&gt; which IMO is a great metaphor for Classic.
---
I don't think it's a good metaphor. Classic isn't filling in any of the gaps that were missing in vanilla, e.g. guild banks, unfinished zones (i.e. Karazhan), unfinished class reworks, unfinished class balance. Most of that was added in BC.
---
To be fair, he may have reported it. I stopped asking "but did you report it" because the answer I got was almost always "yes".
---
&gt;Streamers have been reporting lower damage numbers and quicker recovery times after combat as well, at least the sub 30 level.
---
The damage has been debunked and there is no issue with recovery times. I have to have water at level 30 for certain things. Was doing escort in 1kn and I failed several times in a row because I was running OOM and didn't have water. Once I came back with water I did it on the first try.
---
It'd guess at least 5 minutes to go from no mana to full just standing there with no water. Little less time with mana stream. Takes nearly the full 25 seconds of drinking to get full mana at level 30 (just over 1k mana) with the 800 mana drinks.
---
Well not quite stolen valor, you never put your life at risk to earn those pieces of gear
---
I mean I know that, but the dude who I replied to didn't seem to. I figure my downvotes mean that, that guy made a joke that I whooshed. Whooshception
---
A+ comment!
---
Yes, read Axros's reply. I don't owe you proof of anything. There's a very high chance Nostalrius had it wrong, I just want Blizzard to confirm it.
---
And there's zero evidence that that is even the case!   
---
I'm really sick of circle jerking around private servers being harder going on in the sub.
---
Classic Earl.
---
It's controlled stress testing and in a CLOSED beta. The flood gates will open on release and it will be worse than any stress test--exactly why they should OPEN the beta at some point.
---
i think you will be hard pressed to find anyone starting at 7:30 id pick a server an hour later at most.
---
you wont know till you are in the game and the player base is mostly 60. However people from all paths of life play and you should be able to find people to raid with, just not that early
---
As much as I loved Legion, something just didn’t feel right about years of rumors and myth surrounding the ashbringer suddenly being debunked and irrelevant :/
---
Useful - thank you &amp; up-voted.
---
Outside of end game raiding it was complete trash.
---
I played hardcore in vanilla and quit 2 months into tbc.
---
Damn bro, you dropped the ball at that last part. But I thank your relevant feedback regarding my inept grasp of the language.
---
Wow...this is just cringe right here.
---
A bit of counter-balance to this, TBC also had the best WPvP ever in WoW in Isles of Quel'Danas. There was factions wars there 24/7 between the Sunwell release and Wrath came out.
---
Some people still struggled to PuG Molten Core in TBC. Not because of damage, but tactics obviously. Naxx was still basically impossible with randoms. There was a reason almost no one went back for Ateish, it just wasn't worth the massive hassle of getting an entire raid team into Naxx and AQ40 because it wasn't that easy even then.
---
Leveling speed wasn't increased until Wrath. 1-60 took just as much exp in TBC as it did in Vanilla. 
---
As a Warlock I hardly felt summoning was useless in TBC. Sure the summoning stones took some of the pressure off, but damn at least I didn't need 20 Soul Stones just to get the raid to the entrance. HealthStone wells were also welcome so I didn't have to make individual ones.
---
Players were segregated though. Kael'Thas and Lady Vashj put an effective stop to a lot of raiding guilds that just weren't that good. Almost no one saw Sunwell from the inside. That would probably need a retune if they ever did TBC servers.
---
If only they had implemented some sort of testing phase to trial run this tech before releasing it. Some kind of phase where people can playtest the game and report bugs like this. Imagine if they subjected this technology to multiple stress tests in order to bugtest it before releasing it as a finished product.
---
If only.

Legendary screenshot. Goes down in the annals of Warcraft history for me
---
Ah shit you just reminded me that the release date is way too close to the tax deadlines.
---
So Tauren arent a race anymore?
---
Praise kek.
---
It's a closed beta. What do you think is going to happen on release day when everyone is allowed in?
---
You're a fucking idiot mate. Why, just because I can appreciate Sharding on launch? Or because I like transmog, but suggested an alternative that would obliterate all the (current) complaints about it? Like, can you go into detail with this? I read your two comments, and I decided that you're an absolute retard and delusional. And, just to be clear: the last expansion where I had fun was Cataclysm, due to it's PvE difficulty before nerfs and PvP. Like, I honestly feel like you're too insecure, and just want a select group of people to play Classic. You are the reason why there are a lot of talk about rabid Classic fans that are openly toxic to people just because X.
---
Edit: And let's be clear: it's the devs's fault why we have retail. If they would have stuck to the original game design instead of catering to the needs of every single player in the universe, we would still have a good game, and not need Classic to enjoy WoW again.
---
Super. Thank you very much!
---
Gnome is 100% the best. But if you rather play human then if you don't pvp it's fine. The 5% int boost is negligible.
---
Nobody will have it right away, drops in MC if I remember right. But roughly around 100g for the mats
---
From what I have been able to gather, people love ST because it was this giant maze where you could get lost for hours.
---
I have also learned that people hate Gnomer because it was this giant maze where you could get lost for hours.
---
Once you said ventrilo, I got triggered... it brought back a lot because in my high school, we had a guild with 35-40 people in my school and we would all chill in it after school and all day in the summer

BC &gt; Wrath &gt; Vanilla for me.
---
I was so hyped up when I first started flying around on my dragon. I thought it was the greatest. Took about a week for me to realize that I wasnt playing *World* of Warcraft anymore. The game became just a series of non connected instances. Prior to that it really did feel like I was adventuring in a world.
---
Not really, just if you're looking to min max and never progress past the full blue stage then there's better classes to play for both PvE and PvP content by quite a large margin.
---
Doesn't mean you won't be able to 1v1 people, or that you won't find groups, etc because you can simply perform mechanically better than other people with a little effort.
---
I'd only skip it if you raided in vanilla as a lock and then intend to play super casually but relive the OP as fuck PvP scenarios, because that requires gear you won't get outside of like phase 4-6 raids.
---
member early days huntards lol !  cant believe old school huntards are keeping the name strong ! even in beta !
---
For the third time in this topic, this is a stress test in a CLOSED beta. There will be a massive amount more players once the game is out and open to everyone.
---
Alli bad Horde good
---
Coming to the conclusion that I’m going to call out my 3 work days that week and telling all my friends I have a bad GI bug.
---
5% is the base for dodge, parry, block. The extra 0.6% comes from the boss def skill and your wep skill difference. Each point of difference is 0.04%.
---
This is also the widely accepted formula across old sources like wowwiki entries from 2006.
---
Maybe they use a scale of Naxxramas to Molten Core?
---
Your best bet is to raid with a a guild on the east coast or do some PUG raids. A four hour difference will help you in that sense. There’s plenty of weekday Raiders, but midday might be harder especially for 40 people.
---
private servers
---
Edit: It looks like it was added in patch 1.10 so I was mis-remembering being introduced in TBC
---
Haha that is awesome!
---
Priests in vanilla aren't nearly as squashy as you probably think they are because of inner fire and being able to self shield and psychic scream to fear mobs off them, they can also dot up mobs and wand between healing, its probably pretty comparable dps to a paladin auto attacking while healing. That said, paladins are a ton easier to play well at 60, so letting her play that is probably a good choice.  
---
You should ask your son what class he would like to play for dps. min-maxing isn't half as important as him playing a class he wants to play. Sure 3 manning instances while leveling is a ton harder with a warrior or rogue but if he finds them more fun or appealing, he'll want to play it more.   
---
As for professions, I think leveling skin/minning - herb/alch - anything/enchanter is good for obvious reasons. I would just neglect enchanting while leveling because its a gold sink to level but a lvl 1 enchanter can disenchant everything, which is nice for dungeons.   
---
That said, going blacksmith/engi instead of mining/engi is a bad choice because blacksmithing is mostly a waste of time at 60 unless you are your guilds sole blacksmith that gets dark iron rep. Even still, it still wont earn you money because your guild will expect you to craft everything they need for free and possible make deals with other guilds that net you a very small amount per piece of gear (your axesmith makes nightfall while their armorsmith makes dark iron ect.) Meanwhile mining will allow you to farm arcanite to transmute with the paladin and farm matts for bombs and additional force reactive disks or various other items. At 60, you will want someone to have herbalism for sure though because your biggest expense at 60 will be consumables, engi is great on a paladin, but if she isn't hardcore pvping its probably not worth it to drop herbalism for it.
---
Would you look at that. Useful stress-testing and bug-finding.
---
Yes, it's viable to respec later. The first respec only costs 10s anyway. The *cap* is 50g, not the first ever respec. And you can easily heal all leveling dungeons in a damage spec.
---
Yes. No fmg transmog
---
Almost everyone rolls a dps spec and heals the dungeons anyway. Just keep some int gear in your bags and you’re golden
---
&gt;would it be possible to install the client somehow and test the game in offline mode?
---
No. At least not a legit version.
---
Oh man you are just full of value. Id really like to hear your thoughts and opinions on every post here, and I look forward to reading everything! Should be cake for you bud
---
BC for the hardcore
---
Wrath for the normies
---
Vanilla for everyone in between
---
There are 3 people with shields in the image hahah
---
you can disagree about what #NoChanges is, but you'd be wrong. this outside shit has nothing to do with it.
---
it's about the integrity of the original game.
---
not about streamers streaming the game for donations.
---
not about youtubers making monetized videos about the game.
---
not about how easy it is to look up a guide on how to beat a 2004 raid in 2019.
---
no changes to the game itself.
---
smartass.
---
No changes ship sailed. Original content + 1.12 itemization + 1.12 mechanics is a massive change that makes the game much easier. Saying "no changes" just shows an utter lack of critical thinking.
---
We have a whole team dedicated to Classic, lead by Ion, who is pretty frank about what Classic is supposed to be. I could trust them to make new content for Classic or whatever's next because they are definitely aware of what makes Vanilla and old WoW so different. The problem with the Modern game is it's a "cats out of the bag" already type situation. The game fundamentally appeals to so many different types of players that they're kind of stuck continuing on that path. 
---
&gt; having multiple expacs running at the same time is the ultimate move for them
---
This is one thing I'm not so sure on. While maybe the up front cost to do Classic TBC and Classic WotLK may be low now since they've done Classic already, the playerbase will just become so fragmented between all the version of the game. Would it be worth the cost?
---
I tried to tell everyone, I tried to make people see, but everyone thought 1.12 was a good place to start.
---
1.12 was the "See Vanilla before it's gone" patch, and with that came a lot of tuning that made the game easier than it had been.  Now, I get it, the earlier patches had some bad design behind them.  And no one wants to constantly have to wait for their class to be good.  However, dungeons and raids will seem much easier because of this.  Not that it was actually that challenging before, but easier yes it will be on 1.12.
---
It cost me 1g on Beta to respec the first time.
---
THAT'S THE POINT. You hit the nail right on the head. It's the same game, the same company, the same players.
---
I look forward to massacring you.
---
Human if you don't care. Gnome if you do care.
---
They don't have a rogue class, that's why I didn't include them.
---
Gnome is the master race.
---
Ahhh Gnomer, so many good memories. Like the time my friend was running some of our alts through it with his level 40 Nightelf Hunter and forgot to dismiss his pet after a jump, causing the entire skipped section to aggro to us.
---
Good times.
---
There is a slight dps loss due to the boss having ~1% more dodge. The miss chance and glancing blow dmg will be the same given 305 weapon skill. The crit chance loss will only matter if  you're not crit capped. With wbuffs and good gear, you will most likely be critcapped and it wont affect you much.
---
However, bosses having lower armor will far outweigh the small dps loss.
---
As long as its not  "I like to be able to see what gear people have cause it proves worthyness"  Then, yeah, I'm very curious
---
He's moving the goalpost.
---
There are a couple of streamers I found from their you tube videos (asmond isn't one of them), that have taught me a ton about the game that either I never knew or completely forgot.
---
In videos, your seeing highlight reels, in live stream you getting to see behind the scenes and see that even good players are taking the hits, learning to adapt, and going for another try.
---
Highlight reels are great at seeing what your class is capable of, live streams are great at lowering your expectations closer to the reality of your class, gear, and spec.
---
human male was looking good till he snapped his ankle.
---
There's a big low-level character surge on pservers right now as people do exactly this. FWIW almost all of them are warriors, mages, and rogues.
---
Scaling mobs is a mechanic meant to mimic classic insofar that throughout the entire classic 'expansion' you'd get about as much ilvl increase as you get in a single raid tier on live.
---
If you think that after clearing MC or BWL you're gonna be twoshotting elites you're dead wrong. Stuff does get easier (duh) but not nearly as much as it would in retail without mob health scaling.
---
I consider the lack of threat these 2 million HP mobs pose a much worse problem than the fact that I cannot just oneshot them. That's such a bullshit thing to have. It's like enabling godmode in a game. Fun for about an hour and then you get bored.
---
Thank you.
---
I probably would assume so. It'd be a pretty make believe world if someone went down and people weren't hammering on it while it was down / restarting / starting up
---
Did it increase for the second time?
---
I just wanted to say good luck. We’re all counting on you.
---
It is indeed BIS for fury warriors..
---
That's accurate.
---
That's literally the point of the beta. I guarantee Blizzard appreciates the feedback, as they probably want to check over any discrepancy players bring attention to. They already found a bug in their code a week or so ago where a mob was doing too little damage (because of the Stoneskin totem buff not being removed), so the effort isn't for nothing.
---
Theyre making Oondasta tameable, good luck with that one.
---
Once a target dies, you are supposed to lose all CB off that target.  You must use it before the target dies, or switch targets.
---
Not only is it viable to heal as DPS spec it’s pretty damn not viable to level as heal spec. I wouldn’t even do it if I was leveling the entire time on a 5 man party
---
The experience will never be replicated no matter what they do. And I was told repeatedly that it's not about nostalgia, so why do we need an exact replication of the feeling instead of an exact replication of the game?
---
It's so funny to see this community slowly come around to the truth about Vanilla lol. I still enjoy most aspects of the game immensely but it's not what most people think it was.
---
Such a cool thing to put together! ENFP paladin here, interesting to see not many for that type overall, but not a single warlock at all.
---
Is it actually confirmed we get loot share? Last I heard it was a maybe from blizz.
---
Oh the keyring!  I forgot that one.  I will miss that too.
---
Block user. See ya!
---
Is 300 people in one tiny zone not "massive" enough for you?
---
Wrong. Versus bosses, +5 wep skill will reduce your miss chance by 2%.
---
This guy is a special kind rediculous
---
I remember on my male NE i would always ‘style’ kick players on 5% or less to try and get a cool final blow. Geez
---
Sad thing is, people agree with him
---
For a game built on community its amazing, seeing someone you use to run through instances with now wearing a tier set. I would like the collection tab tbh tho, mounts/pets/toys always took up a lot of space in my inv back then
---
It will never be enough to prevent lag at the AQ event.
---
I remember it clearly. Thousands of people, 1-3 fps and giant ass statues that killed everyone lolm
---
They do get tactical mastery be the very tippy top raid dps specs are slamming between swing timers to maximize dps. They simply can't lose that rage just for overpower.
---
Might as well just buy a 1 month prepaid card then
---
I remember this as well actually. I think there were several ways to fall off of a flight path through the duration of vanilla
---
&gt; new content helps you in that content specifically.
---
This is what resist gear sorta accomplished in Vanilla. You had to get a certain resistance for some encounters as a gear check, but resist gear really wasn't that powerful in other situations.
---
Naxx gear was so far above the likes of MC gear and even though some vertical progression is needed and fun, it should be more limited and expanded horizontally instead. They could get really creative with gear that could alter spells/abilities and aren't just vertical better. Something akin to Diablo 3's Legendary's where a few key pieces could unlock an entirely new build/way to play your class.
---
Ahh look the offtank is speaking lol
---
Transmog and LFG are both absolutely terrible
---
Honestly terrified. The way they explained it sounded as if each layer was basically its own isolated server that would then only be merged at a later date based on population levels. Instead what it's looking like from the videos is sharding by a different name. Current layering implementation is a massive fuckup.
---
I liked BC quite abit. The Wpvp objectives in every zone, the class balance and new abilities/talents were great.
---
Second is 5g, then 10, 15, etc. up to a max of 50g.
---
Actually its the other way around. Warriors dominate from MC to BWL, but then mages start catching up in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
A good warrior will still top charts in every raid though.
---
A friend of mine who used to play gnome warrior back then always used to tell me gnomes had a hidden bonus when it came to melee range , it didn't make much sense to me then but I think their hitbox and reach is exactly the same as other non-tauren races but since their size it smaller it's somewhat visually disproportionate, since you'd expect their hitbox/reach to match their size.
---
Blizzard probably meant it to be this way or else no one would roll any kind of gnome melee class.
---
Same here
---
AOE looting is the only thing on this list that is 100% quality of life.  Transmog is purely cosmetic.  It isn't a quality of life or gameplay-altering feature.  (edit: I've actually seen elsewhere some points that transmog does in fact have some relatively minor gameplay impact as well.)
---
Every other "QoL" feature you've listed is literally game-changing (some obviously more than others).  It's fine if you like said features, but realize that from the start you don't seem to realize the impact of certain features on the core gameplay of WoW.  These changes are not solely "QoL" like you seem to think.  Classic with AoE looting would still feel 99.99% like Vanilla.  Classic with flying mounts would be an utterly different game.
---
I, personally, wouldn't mind a few quality of life changes to make the UI and game feel more modern, and Blizzard already is making/keeping a few things like this.  But even if something like raid finder *hypothetically* makes the game better (I don't think it does, but that's besides the point), adding it would be completely contrary to the spirit of Classic recreating Vanilla.
---
I really liked how big the world felt in vanilla when there were areas of the game I knew I wasn't going to see. I didn't have a problem with it, because I'm okay with the idea that if I'm not willing to put in the work then I don't reap the rewards, and I wasn't inclined to put in the work. And that was fine!
---
I do have to say, though, that I don't think TBC made unreasonable concessions to accessibility. In my experience with Wrath it might have gotten a bit excessive, but I was able to gear and pug a lot of content. You still had to carry your weight, farm your consumables, buy your enchants, and get geared, but it may have gone a bit overboard in this regard.
---
There are pros and cons to some kind of accessible "story mode" or leaving it aloof and unattainable to most players. Each has their positives and negatives and I'm not entirely sure that either outweighs the other (assuming catch-ups are in moderation and not over the top like Wrath+).
---
This is all moot when it comes to a static server that isn't going to release expansions and ilvl jumps, as there is a hell of a lot more time for even super casual players to eventually pick their way through the content. We likely won't be faced with the same Naxx dilemma where 99% of players never saw it because expansion release.
---
You should really only do 1-60 once or twice from now until release and youll be good to go, maybe not realm first but definitely top 5 if you keep focused during the run.
---
Really make sure that you do starting zone a bunch of times (1-10) so you can get ahead of the herd easier.
---
If your friend can farm some elixirs like under water breathing or swim speed, noggenfogger, etc. that would help a ton too.
---
You play wow don't you? You do mythic+ runs? Want that weekly chest? You are already a gambling addict and you don't even know it. Pile of mold on a sandwich.
---
That's where you're wrong.  It's fun to have your gear MEAN SOMETHING when you're out in the world.  Wouldn't it be nice to live in a world where that gear you spent all that time to get does something for you besides slightly higher numbers.  Going from greens and purples you can feel the impact you're starting to have on the world around you.  Enemies become easier to deal with and you can feel the power.  Gear matters.  And that's a good thing.  
---
Gear isn't the only factor in the equation, but it's a big part of the equation as it should be.
---
Depends on the class.  Most dps specs can heal dungeons just fine.
---
There's also plenty of non standard healer spec talent strategies that can be used.  For example, start out priest with spirit tap from shadow and wand spec from disc. Continue down disc to meditation and flesh out most of the shadow tree  That's pretty much the bread and butter of making leveling solo with priest and being able to heal dungeons fairly easy.
---
Should've been 360p and have heavily oversized font in notepad
---
Not in vanilla, but I farmed this dungeon for like 3 weeks to get the Tyrants Legplates.
---
Extra attacks do reset swing timers on private servers.
---
EMERALD DREAM WILL RISE AGAIN
---
It's bullcrap, I bet half of them are koreans.
---
You fucking elitist twat. People can enjoy both classic and retail. Retail isn’t YOUR game only. Fuck off.
---
Flying mounts in BC. 🤢🤢🤢 Definitely not the best version of the game.
---
You can spec full DPS to level and still heal dungeons as long as you put aside some INT/SPIRIT gear. Same goes for tanking if you set aside the right armor and weapon/shield for it.
---
You don't need to be healing spec to heal lowbie instances.  For that matter, you don't need to have a full heal spec until you reach raids.  For that matter, some healing classes did not require full heal specs to be viable anyways.  Shamans usually only went 21 points in.  Discipline tree for priest back then was also more of a mana conservation tree opposed to a healing output tree like holy was.
---
Are you serious? On release day there will be more than two servers. At the present time they're putting as many people as possible in 2 servers to stress test.
---
the fps problem was from players personnal computers, not the servers :)
---
Good old druid shadowmeld &gt; flight form to never have to worry about world pvp.
---
Even without PI, our raid mages needed an addon for AQ/Naxx that [tracked rolling ignites damage and had a large "STOP DPS" button](https://imgur.com/uEMJYZH). It would flash for all the other mages to let the ignite fall off when the mage who owned the ignite hit the button. Think that got upgraded in later expansions -- wonder what it was called again...
---
where do people get this idea? its the most hardcore confirmation bias in the world. There are THOUSANDS of people playing the beta but because 50-100 streamers get in they are the only ones playing and blizzard hates everyone else? christ people its not like its a single high pop server of only streamers, just because they are the only ones you are seeing doesn't mean the rest of us aren't playing too.
---
Why dont you torrent it like everyone else its easy
---
BRE proc rate has good sources to be accurate. However, it won't be nearly as useful on classic due to bosses having lower armor than on private servers.
---
With that red lamp its an obvious give away hes going Horde.
---
I wanted to reiterate and make some redundant claims a few times over and over again to make sure you understood. :)
---
You're welcome. I'm glad you've realized how little you understand, how ignorant you are, and how far you need to go!
---
I remember wanting the sword on my mage and getting both parts only to realize i couldn't equip an offhand sword to forge the two lmao ... i was so disappointed.... :(
---
Aslong as you have the gear for it (int, spirit, or w.e it may be), you should be able to heal any of the leveling dungeons in any spec. Will it be easier in the correct spec? Absolutely.
---
Yeah I agree completely. Flying being the same as a normal mount but with z-axis capability is just too unlimited. They could really make it require thoughtful interaction and retain everything about pre Flight WoW.
---
In 3 years ask for Classic +. 
---
Until then #NoChanges 
---
Get the museum piece done right first. Then we can look at other avenues. Seasons/Post Naxx/BC/Wrath/Classic + etc. 
---
Better yet look to have elements of Classic brought back to live. If they came out with a Server that had single server layering instead of the sharding, No CRZ, No LFR, No LFD. I would start fresh on one of those servers after I’m done with Classic in a heart beat.
---
I kinda like female night elf but I do agree that troll is great lol.
---
Have mom make hotpockets.
---
what?
---
Ah, he says he wants to hit 96 hours. My bad.
---
Not "hard", necessarily, but the scariest I remember were those big T-Rexes in Un'Goro Crater.   You're minding your own business, trying to earn Linken's Sword  of Mastery, then one of those jerks shows up out of nowhere and you wind up running for your life across what feels like the entire zone.
---
The E to I correlation I think is the most interesting thing out of this. Some thoughts.
---
1.  Maybe introverts are attracted to the game more because it offers them some semblance of community and social interaction they otherwise would not get. "Social situations they can bail on in a moments notice".
---
2. I wonder if it was closer back in classic days due to the game being more social. I am a hard ENFP. Really extroverted. And I was playing hard in Vanilla/TBC/Wrath, but once LFD/LFR and flying were introduced, social was killed, and I remember that being around the same time I started hating the game. My favorite thing about the game was meeting people. DOing groups, making friends, etc. When that was taken away, what was the point? I could play a better RPG elsewhere if I didn't have to group with others.
---
There is absolutely no reason to believe that. I think you probably see streamers playing it and think that's what everyone is doing. Assumptions
---
That real classic feeling.
---
21. Quit right around when naxx came out, got burned out on that ogre dps check.
---
My roommate got really bad food poisoning from a Hot pocket like a year ago so I stay clear of them now :(.
---
If you're thinking of priest there is a Disc based leveling spec thats great for dungeons and proven as fast as the shadow spec for leveling.
---
Yes there would. "Kek", I assume, would be the sound the Orc makes when saying their version of "LoL". It would sound the same to anyone hearing it. There are other languages besides Orcish and those spoken by the Alliance.
---
I never understood why female trolls have to run like their back is inflexible. I'd love to play one but they run like they got a stick up their ass so far that their upper body is entirely inflexible. Like a pole with legs.
---
This is a lot of why I chose Human on Nost. That, and Gnome's are so small you don't get to enjoy the awesome gear you just got. 
---
You do get to slide into some fireplaces which can be convenient.
---
Vanilla WoW was always about the gear. Individual player competence matters a lot, but if you come across a warrior with ass-candy and AQ40 shoulders you know you're in for a wild ride.
---
in the first two weeks? jesus christ they are still identifying them dude
---
It was a joke bro. I'm in the beta. Take it down a notch or 5.
---
No, I don't believe there's any way to play the game offline, and the only way to access Vanilla versions is through pservers or beta right now
---
&gt;Allows potential players to obtain more personal bank space on an alt if they have a lot of extra cash
---
This isn't really that big of a deal because you can send so much shit to bank alts and keep it in the mail, bank space shouldn't be an issue for anyone.
---
Got it working now, you were right I had a missing comma. Should of thought of that first, cheers for your help! Also brilliant site.
---
If they where to put a guild bank it should be very primitive, like in bc.
---
Throwing shade on WotLK like that? Lmao no way, it was easily WoW's peak.
---
I think BC is widely considered peak WoW. Classic has a lot of nostalgia going for it.
---
Guild banks are a great idea to be included in classic wow and I think is a very effective litmus test for how cleareyed people come to the discussion of classic changes.
---
As the person who tried and failed originally, I am glad this is out there. More responses than I initially got, too, which is great (mine capped at 800-ish).
---
INTP Horde (Orc) Hunter who wants to kill Alliance!
---
But it's going to be exactly the same as a Vanilla server launch... 3000 people is a fuck load. And if the 'each layer is a continent' thing is true, it's going to be even worse than Vanilla  launches. So, it's not actually solving that issue.
---
Nostalgia Critics review of X-Men 3 is hilarious:
---
Scene 1:  I just watched X-Men 3.  It was AWFUL.  They focused a ton on Wolverine, like everyone dies, and they even kill off Xavier.
---
Oh my, this sounds like the worst movie ever.
---
It is.  I'm going to hang up now because of how angry I am.
---
Scene 2:  I just watched Logan.  It was AWESOME.  They focused a ton on Wolverine, like everyone dies, and they even kill off Xavier.

Oh my, this sounds like the best movie ever.

It is.  I'm going to hang up now because of how happy I am.

I agree, but if this is an issue for people... Hey this is a way to fix it. =D
---
There’s no default choice. Characters have random appearances each time you go to make one.
---
TBC has many things to love. Better balance and hard raids being the biggest two things. Where TBC falls short and became far worse are Arena's, Flyers, Tokens, and Intro into dungeon finder. That being said Dungeon finder was okay in tbc because all of the dungeons it had were made before dungeon finder so it didn't compromise their quality.
---
WoTlK was a pile of shit. It is only fondly remembered because it closed the Arthas story arc. Other then that. It was a pile of shit and, the begining of the end for True Wow.
---
It was very difficult for me to find a tauren hunters deadzone before I found the rezz stone, and assumed others had same problem.
---
My bad, thanks for the correction.
---
I loved WotLK up until you could queue up for raids instead of having to organize it yourself. I prefer having to do some footwork.
---
I think it's because there was some sense of order to ST that people could figure out eventually, but gnomer was always just a constant mess.

INTP rolling druid, the most common choice for INTPs. I feel like a cliché.

If Jeff Bezos played this game for 10 years, i guarantee you he would be world class
---
And that guy has probably got lower than average motor skills. Competency is gud. Think about that pleb
---
For the first 20-25 levels that is.
---
Then it becomes less and less easy and effectively impossible, before you hit 60.
---
This becomes abundantly clear if your tank or healer is under geared or under leveled.
---
or.... or... let's just not add them

I’ve learned to love the female troll waddle over the years, it’s kind of amusing.
---
I'll take Leonidas over xXfrostshockXx and his partner pwnzorz any day.
---
I completely agree. Very primitive, like zero QOL options in it, purley just a vault that is shareable between officers and GM to allow access to the gbank without account sharing being a thing. Keeps everyone safer.
---
Hehe, guess you will see in Classic what the top private server guilds are capable of. We will still use Fury tanks, we will still clear raids in 30 min.
---
Bosses doing more burst damage doesnt matter when you have 12k hp and capped physical dmg reduction.
---
You killed a disgusting bloodthirsty monster from an alien planet. The Alliance thanks you for your service!
---
Blizzard had said pretty much from the outset that they'd be using 1.12. Regardless of mine or anyone else's opinion on that, it's already happening. You might as well argue that people can't say \#nochanges unless the game launches with its closed alpha specs and no computer is allowed to run it without using dial-up and directX7.
---
We were never going to get an absolutely picture-perfect chronological recreation of the game as it originally launched. But the game *should* be as close to what it was designed to be as of the already-agreed-upon 1.12 patch. "Blizzard already changed this one thing" is not grounds to follow up with "Therefore we should change this other thing." The best way to avoid a slippery slope is to not slide down it.
---
And on the subject of 1.12 patch itemization and such, most of the "broken gear" will be locked behind phases to simulate when it was originally accessible in Vanilla, so the only real question is whether the 1.12 *talent trees* make the game much easier. I don't know if it's even possible for someone to objectively answer that even in regards to an individual spec as opposed to the game as a whole. But seeing as how a lot of the initial talents that got removed were simply bad placeholders that nobody ever used anyway, I personally don't think this has a meaningful overall effect on difficulty. There are certainly some outliers, such as Mages in 1.12 having better AoE because AE had become instant by default long before. Is that good enough reason to fuck with leveling dungeon difficulty? I say no; it was already "easy" (from a mechanical perspective, anyway) in Vanilla well before 1.12 rolled around, and it should remain easy. Tweaking damage numbers does nothing to change the core strategy of "pull small packs slowly so you're not overwhelmed", and actually adding mechanics to trash or bosses would be a quintessential non-Vanilla experience, *well* beyond whatever perceived ease is introduced with 1.12 talent trees.
---
Well the Reason you had so much gold is, people get Gold after EXP, in Retail you will be way way slower.
---
I mean there is a pretty detailed discussion in this thread about it. How you could get through it without at least a partial understanding of both perspectives is beyond me.
---
Filthy alliance scum.
---
Can't wait to gank you friend!
---
No and also no. They started in BC and they weren't full raids. They were easy started raids that rewarded bad gear. Cata actually gave raiders a choice of raid size with equal gear and difficulty between the two.
---
That's exactly what I said. If you are 10 people you cannot complete the quests related to LBRS but you can complete those related to UBRS.
---
The first 20 levels were so fun.
---
Arena's were garbage. Terrible Idea for an RPG to suddenly try to be an E-sport. They had no place in the game and, are one of the biggest reasons suddenly every class needed to play the same and be homogenized.
---
took me 40-50m to do northshire.  grouped up for all kill quests solo for the bandannas.  
---
trying to get the gold dust/candles was seemingly impossible but you can at least do the exploration quests and goldtooth since he respawned pretty fast.  rest of the zone shouldnt be too bad since there are a shitload of murlocs and such to grind if youre really desperate
---
No and also no. They started in BC and they weren't full raids. They were easy started raids that rewarded bad gear. Cata actually gave raiders a choice of raid size with equal gear and difficulty between the two. Also wraith raids were much easier and just not as fun.
---
Vael is basically just a dps check and a really reductionist example of what im talking about. Especially when my argument has a lot to do with itemization, talents etc in addition to strats.
---
Youre right this is a pointless conversation to have with eachother. Have a good one.
---
Then the first few assumptions about aren't working for you.
---
So you don’t want classic wow?
---
You think you do but you don’t.
---
Wanna keep things safer? Stop sharing accounts.
---
The point of beta isn't to check every mob's stat against people's recollection of mob stats on private servers.  
---
Yes, they found the stoneskin bug, but that had nothing to do with private servers and, more importantly, it was raised with actual evidence of the monster doing too little damage relative to vanilla originally (the video of Joana leveling).
---
OPEN THE GATE!

PvP miles and miles better.

Underused specs brought up to par.

---
End game raiding like you said.
---
FPS capping at 100 when I'm running full details and 4k, it just feels so wrong. And so right.
---
Weren't they suppose to full avoid then ? Teleport is a retail thing, no ?
---
&gt; 3 hours a day M-F and 6+ on weekends is considered casual now? 
---
The M-F numbers are just barely lower than my "hardcore" days in highschool and the weekend numbers are much higher.
---
The issue with doing TBC is the last patch of TBC was pretty garbage. Tokens, Flyers, Dungeon finder and, Arenas. No thanks. I liked the beginning of it though. Before the pvp gear really started going and they started trying to homogenize every class for arena.
---
In my experience it is far more common that prima donna raiders who contribute very little whine about not getting enough loot, and then leave. 
---
In a lot of guilds its impossible for a class leader or other officer to ever take an item without someone complaining, even when the officer prioritizes literally all the line members first.
---
That doesn't solve any problem actually. This change literally only prevents account sharing at higher levels and nothing else. Preventing TOS violations keeps blizzard happy and GMs can still Ninja guild banks like they used to if they so choose.
---
That still doesn't change the fact that he played a big role in this?
---
Getting a sick looking piece of gear that replaces the dumbest model you've ever seen in a game is a feeling that no modern transmog can give you
---
Tauren already have huge range on melee attacks. So as you increase their size, their hitbox + range also increases. Meaning you can attack the enemy from an even bigger distance (unless the mechanics are different now).
---
I asked son and wife previously.
---
Son said I’d rather be a ranged DPS didn’t care which.
---
Wife said she just wants to keep me alive and hit some things lol. 
---
Neither really know enough to choose. I guess that’s good for them as this will all be new.
---
So the “too many”/“too few” questions are VERY different. It’s also important to note that this is all guesswork based on my technical knowledge as an engineer, not anything Blizzard will definitely do. That said....
---
The “too many” question isn’t really a problem in today’s day and age. The problem that often leads to queuing is “too fast”. A large but static and predictable server population can just have a much larger amount of baseline resources, so as long as things actually settle down in how *dynamic* they are, large servers won’t cause a problem. If the server population changes dramatically day to day, you need dynamic resources, which is where layering comes in. 
---
The “too few” question is more of a gameplay issue. If 12 months from now there’s not even enough players to fill a server, of course you’ll have to come
---
up with some type of server combo solution. But let’s hope we have enough players to keep all servers alive.
---
They do exist where itemisation works better. If you give players more gear after Naxx they just become super overpowered and the game breaks. Better to just either launch TBC or a new server with different content.
---
[This post from J. Allen Brack's old boss might make you like JAB a bit more](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a8jcyq/this_post_from_j_allen_bracks_old_boss_might_make/)
---
It's a layering thing. You relog you get a different layer.
---
I know, it's just the fun about trading, selling, giving stuff away for free, negotiate.
---
getting kited was the stated weakness, shamans have basically 1 slow which costs them their interupt, and maybe ghost wolf as a meme. Compared to warriors, rogues, mages, hunters, they aren't even close to a good class for closing the gap, and keeping it closed. So you could name the spell with a slowing mechanic, hunters have a spell that heals it doesnt make them good healers.
---
Not a cliche; An accurate representation of who you are!
---
The just because the power creep also affects enemy mobs, doesn't mean it isn't power creep.
---
Power creep is when new content is introduced to a game, that is so powerful that it overshadows earlier content.
---
In Vanilla, this didn't really happen. Even when raiding Nax, gear from earlier raids than AQ40 and even dungeons could still be useful.
---
In BfA, when a new patch introduces new gear, that makes every peace of gear from the previous patch underpowered, outdated and useless.
---
It's the textbook definition of powercreep.
---
Best playlist na

it can be cool to see if obscure, not so much one of the most owned games ever.
---
And what about PvP...? I know DKs were imbalanced as all living hell when they came out but besides that?

What about the flight masters?  Flying has been a thing in Azeroth since day 1, just not on your own mount.

---
Explain how I've moved the goal post whatsoever. If you have something to contribute go ahead. Dont just insult me with some dismissive comment.
---
Curious if you could provide "tons of" sources for 15% parry in vanilla.  The bug report is pretty fair in linking references understanding otherwise.
---
We all have phones, but we aren't the target audience for Immortal. Blizzard wants to tap into the Chinese market and working with a Chinese developer is likely one of the only ways to do so legally.
---
He's confusing being a hardcore raider and being a hardcore player.
---
When your life is videogames, that's a hardcore gamer.
---
eh not really. dungeon elite trash have been dealing like 20% higher damage yes, but elites out in the world has also been reported by players like frostadamus to be more difficult. There were elites he was able to easily solo on private that he wasn't able to on classic beta. He said it was mainly due to it having higher movement speed than on private, as well as using more abilities. We also know that mobs out in the world in general are tougher on classic beta.
---
edit: also we know that private servers used a standard +15 resist value on raid bosses, while on classic it can be as high as 200
---
100% agree on your first point!! (though I quit during Cata) For me, flying mounts in the old world also made it feel way smaller, just like being the big hero did for the story. I want to feel tiny in comparison to the scale of the world! 
---
I played a druid, and I remember spending ages trying to figure out how to finish that one quest in westfall to get my aquatic form, so I'm also super excited to see quest markers and training quests back in the game!
---
Keep in mind these are _stress tests_. They are deliberately testing out different server configurations here to see how things fail. Just because this happened like this in one stress test doesn't mean that's definitively how Blizz wants it to be.
---
You've also touched on the reasons why I feel Roleplaying will be more immersive for folks on an RP server.
---
Bro. Save some of the women for us, k?
---
Paladin might be the most reworked class. Wrath paladin worked very differently from vanilla. The seal system is different and there are no instant attacks like crusader strike, DS, or exorcism. Also there is no seal of blood, which cripples ret damage. Offhealing as ret is not very sustainable or strong without wearing healing gear (no art of war etc). There's also no regen like replenishment buff from talents.
---
I think the confusion here is in the interpretation. Read the wrong way it seems like the "defender" is the second party, thus making you the attacker. I believe it is meant to be read as if you are the defender. Replace the word "your" with "their" and I think you'll be on the same page as everyone else.
---
The defender is the one having their swing time reduced, so the sentence "unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining" makes no sense from the perspective of you being the attacker.
---
Lag would probably keep everyone seemingly on the ground.
---
Yes, yes you did. Now convince your "buddies" to go Horde or ditch them.
---
Second that. Even just getting through. That graveyard 😭
---
I do want classic wow, this doesn't effect the vanillia aspect of the game AT ALL. 
---
I'm not sharing my account lol. If we don't get guild banks, then they just wont have access to anything while I'm not online. However there will be a ton of guilds that do account share and that in the long run puts more work on blizzard employees.
---
I'm presenting an option to allow blizzard CS reps to do less work, account admins to do less work, and really have the exact same outcome as a guild bank on a separate character.
---
Ya i was thinking maybe if i joined an EST server i might find better luck, but still might be difficult. I was also thinking an EU server, maybe something in the UK timezone as that would fit well, but i dont know what ping would be on an EU server. You have any idea what ping might be at?
---
Ideally I can dream that this post will get more people in my situation, and we could collectively choose a server to roll on.
---
Mage food is a very obvious example of this.
---
The stack size per cast increases as you level.
---
The heroic raids were so face roll out took longer to clear them than some most wraith raids lol!
---
Sounds like you needed new friends, not to betray your brethren in arms
---
It's easier and cheaper for Blizzard to manage the servers if they use it.
---
Yeah, I tend to not stick around very long in the endgame of wow expansions so I dont know the excact highest numbers.
---
Which is excatly why I wrote that the numbers were not precise, their point was merely to illustrate the hyperinflation of numbers in the latest expansions.
---
My argument with it is that the content   was already in vanilla (kara, hyjal, etc.) but instead of polishing off vanilla they rolled it all together and sold as an expac (after blizzard told everyone they wouldn't do expansions since we paid monthly for content updates, hence the subs). This is whenm greediness took over the WoW design and the (very) slippery slope began. 
---
It marked the beginning of the end of  retail wow. 
---
With all that out of the way: I really like how they focused more on balancing hybrid classes so they can function more than just a secondary healer. I like draenei lore and illidan was badass.
---
Arenas where fine in tbc IMO, different classes added different things back then. The result of trying to balance it ended in disaster, that I can agree with.
---

You described them backwards :( you'd be right if you flipped your sentences.

The in depth tests they're doing to make sure it's an identical recreation are glitz and glamor to you? What the fuck are you talking about. Give the company some credit for doing something well for once.
---
...back when my mother took her first breath I always knew I wanted to roll a hunter... tells long winded story involving entire gaming, educational and professional career. Goes on to basically say nothing except they are playing classic.
---
its amazing that you had those adventures but now days its all to easy to just google any number of questions related to this game now. I started just before TBC so I missed alot of the iconic moments of vanilla so im extremely excited to have my own adventures in the era I missed out on.
---
Brand new to WoW. Somebody explain what I just watched.
---
Regarding class decisions. Classic will (should) be around for a LONG time, so there will be plenty of time to play anything and everything :)
---
Gotta love creating a new character in retail and seeing a level 4 riding around on a god damn motorcycle.
---
I actually love the titanforging system and think it's a fantastic addition.
---
I think retail wow and BFA actually have a ton of very intelligent design decisions and systems as a whole, but with some structural and staffing problems leading to a terrible implementation.
---
But mostly what I want from Classic is a persistent RPG world without the threat of updates or obsolescence. I want the option for a super longform RPG experience with a clear trajectory and end (beating Naxx being the end, obviously you can still play and do stuff)
---
So normal sharding then? Because that's exactly what we don't want, regardless of if it's turned off in zones with world bosses. Layering at least attempts to preserve a consistent world.
---
I can’t think about anything except what kind of upbringing you had to lead you to the point you’re at now. 
---
What went wrong, because your obviously so unhappy in your personal life that your entire existence revolves around video games. 
---
Find a job, take a shower, go for a walk. Clean up the piss bottles. Find a girl, move out of your parents house. 
---
It gets better man.
---
Everything in Vanilla feels like it comes from a single, unified theme. The succession of compartmentalized expansions on top of each other makes retail look &amp; feel incredibly disjointed. Warriors in T1 transmog next to Pandaren riding Astral Cloud Serpents next to Demon Hunters riding Sky Golems, etc.
---
For me, this compounds your first point. Instead of adventurers traveling through the world, we're all titan-slayers riding around on dragons.
---
Thanks but I already made the edit upon rereading their comment and realizing my own mistake.
---
And how do they kill the king /advisor without aspect of cheetah?
---
Pretty sure OP was referring specifically to raiding. Obviously mages were fine in dungeons.
---
What's really fascinating is that the top 4 personalities in this poll all fall in the bottom 50% of the general population.
---
Different polls will probably have slightly different order, but the one I checked was: INFP (9th place: 4.4% of population), INTJ (14th place: 2.1%), INTP (11th place: 3.3%), and then INFJ (the rarest at 1.5%). Further, the lowest Introvert type on this poll (ISFJ) is the most popular in the general population (making up 13.8% of folks).
---
NOT surprisingly (for gamers) is that "The I's Have It" ... overwhelmingly introverted bunch. :D

 #NoChanges
---
Wasnt there quest for compas in booty bay? Luring giant out with wine and food to revenge for ships. Or this chain was added later?
---
I think the problem here is that it's one person who said this. Yes, he's currently president of the Blizzard side of ActiBlizzard, but J Allen Brack was the only one who said this. 
---
The original answer was just "no.", until J Allen Brack decided to amend it (for some silly reason).
---
Ion Hazzikostas, the current Lead Game Dev, was the leader of Elitist Jerks during Vanilla. I'm sure he holds a special place in his heart for it.
---
More servers along with a ton more players.
---
I don't really have an opinion either way on guild banks in classic. There's something to be said for the old way where you had to trust your guildies, and guild banks as far as I know still don't stop a rogue GM from stealing all the loot or misappropriating it somehow.
---
I don't think guild banks would break the game, I just don't think they're as necessary as people seem to think. Oh no, somebody will have to volunteer to update spreadsheets. The horror. Except that these days we'll probably see an addon the bank alt uses to log items and share that information with guild members or allow it to be dumped in HTML or something so it can be pasted and viewed on the guild website.
---
I just don't see how adding guild banks is necessary, and it avoids the biggest con of adding them, in that it further allows and encourages skirting limited bag/bank space.
---
TBC had some improvements like some class specs becoming viable and improved dungeon design, but tons of mistakes like: flying mounts which caused a lack of world pvp, both factions having the same city, epics just getting handed out (which got even worse after they nerfed Kharazan). Those changes in toto did away with much of the organic player made content and sense of achievement that made vanilla so good.
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
Are you serious
---
What about oceanic servers? Your 'abnormal' time would be around the Aussie 'normal' time, right?
---
More proof that Gnomes are the superior race.
---
No, they want server firsts and local fame, why compete when you can have your own kingdom?
---
&gt;A large but static and predictable server population can just have a much larger amount of baseline resources, so as long as things actually settle down in how  
---
&gt;dynamic  
---
&gt;they are, large servers won’t cause a problem.
---
This is the problem they cause. Vanilla servers were balanced around their pop limits at the time. Black  Lotus having a set respawn timer, rarity of Thorium, World Bosses. They would have to change all of this to handle larger populations.
---
I'm not saying it could be done or that it would be easy, but laying at this point would be potentially exploitable. One guild getting 2 servers worth of Black Lotus while all the other, 2 servers worth of, guilds get none.
---
Should and Hope are some very uncertain terms.  
---
Edit: hope I'm not coming off as overly confrontational, I'll just never understand why people are so okay with Layering when it does nothing to alleviate any issues at a server launch (the entire reason Blizz was considering any kind of Sharding in the first place) while introducing potentially game breaking exploits.
---
You are a part of the problem!
---
 Layering is not an open world experience and it is not how the game should
---
Play. I’m totally fine with it in the first few weeks for a the beginner zones but not one second after. Making more servers and merge them makes way more sense to me.
---
Also, it’s clear the game is going to be a wild success and servers are going to be over populated so why make less and then have to creat server transfers like they did back in the day?
---
IME there is more RP in regular RP servers but the maturity is higher on RPPVP servers compared to regular PVE and PVP servers.
---
Good. ^/s
---
Those fucking ghosts in Silithus that spawned wasps when they died.
---
I never played vanilla, but I hate the pre-max level BG system where everyone has leveling gear. Ruined BG’s for new players and those who didn’t want to blaze through the leveling process.
---
Yeah, they are deliberately testing out different server configurations here to see how things fail. Just because this happened like this in one stress test doesn't mean that's definitively how Blizz wants it to be. 
---
Some people are just looking for any little thing to get outraged over (and tbh it's warranted sometimes), but you gotta be informed about what's actually going on before you grab the ol' pitchfork.
---
It's an entirety different type of flying
---
not really, the layer sizes are fixed. You won't experience more people than on the stress test
---
Scaling and sharding made me a saaaaad panda.  
---
Other changes weren't amazing and some are ok, but those two made BFA a bunch of no fun to me.
---
Yea bro, i need the job.
---
Again competency is everything, even in work.
---
lol, and let's get real i'm like an adonis next to you.

that's how you can be belligerent too. Don't have to bend over everywhere you go. Even in a fucking video game forum you wanna bend over to activision.

13 toons to 10 on the stress test or beta?
---
If you give a mouse a cookie. He's going to ask for a glass of milk. If you want to play retail play retail. You aren't forced to play Classic.
---
I would argue that the orc passive to resist stuns is far more valuable. I'm a little biased to Horde though.
---
We need more testers like you.  Not necessarily because of right or wrong results.  But the methodology and the willingness to put in the hard work involved.
---
The fact that they made Arenas the only thing that mattered in PvP sucked a lot. It turned PvP into another elitist gatekeeping system like raiding was. If you weren't the optimal spec with optimal gear in the optimal group comp, you were shit.
---
And it was just glorified group dueling. Those of us who didn't like it were shit out of luck because if you wanted to progress in the new PvP rankings, it was Arena or nothing. So for me it was nothing and I haven't gone back since. It soured me on PvP for everything going forward and now I just don't do it.
---
TY. What I figured and have been doing.
---
Ya 730 is a bit early, but i guess the main point is to see if there are many people who are looking to raid during the daytime, as opposed to the typical evening/night raiders. (I work a swing shift, and throws a wrench in the typical raiding times)
---
I remember blowing up the door to the ship the first time. That was amazing. And seeing the Goblins in the rooms before. I had played WC2 and 3 before so I knew their history, but I wasnt expecting to see them there.
---
I'm not saying Druids can't tank - I'm saying why would you want to? If you're trying to play optimally (seems like you are given how much you care about threat per second), then Druids just have a better toolkit for off-tanking and Warriors do for main-tanking. That's not debatable.
---
Well, that's not really the argument, you've misrepresented it, but there is a valid point to be found.
---
When you lose the element of identification, that is to say, you are unable to identify a character's strength at an eyeball glance, it can affect the decisions you make.
---
You might find yourself just attacking anybody out in the world because hey, they might have awful gear or hey, they might have awesome gear who knows, won't find out until I punch 'em.
---
When you can recognize player power by observation, it has a strong effect on your decision making, and how you feel making those decisions. Do you stray WAAAAAY far off the path to avoid passing by that Warrior with his ashkandi, or worrilessly scamper by because you believe you can take him if he decided to start something?
---
It created that atmosphere of danger, which contributed to the overall feeling of the danger the world presented considering there are at all times any number of frighteningly powerful players roaming about.
---
That feeling is completely gone when you can't identify the strength of a player at a glance.
---
So it has nothing to do with "worthiness" as you deafly put it, it's about danger and the adrenaline you get when being apprehended by someone of such observable power, or the power you feel if you're even being assisted by such a player.
---
I love this quote:

What's wrong with achievements or having multiple difficulties with raids? I get that some iterations of the difficulties were a hassle at some point in Wow's life cycle but as a concept at least I see nothing wrong with it.
---
EDIT: Wasn't the tier gear from HC tokens normal tier and not that of a higher difficulty?
---
Shadowmeld is very strong, especially for hunters, certainly. But Orc hardiness isn't exactly anything but amazing either. It's consistently useful against everyone (even classes without stuns due to engineering bombs and Tidal Charm).
---
The agility part really doesn't matter.
---
Don't worry, returning to glorious Stormwind or Ironforge will wipe those sorrows away
---
Fuck mudhuts
---
They aren't going. I don't believe they will hire another crew to start content for classic while also pushing a new expansion. 
---
Honestly, i would love if they someone added all the content that got cut from original wow like hellfire peninsula. Emerald dream. Azshara crater. But it won't happen. You will either get another legacy server like BC eventually or it'll always stay vanilla.

"We hear you" doesn't count. All will be forgiven if this guy has admitted publicly to making a mistake.
---
Less work? Banning people is mostly automated. 
---
If it doesn’t effect the vanilla experience then why do you want it? 
---
Tons of guilds won’t account share. I highly doubt there will even be “tons” of guilds that clear raids. Stop making up numbers to support your opinion.
---
Would I be right in assuming that this was just one shard on that server and that there's potentially another 5x that amount split over the other shards?  
---
Crazy shit.
---
I want to love POE but I just have no idea what's good or even how people are crafting these GG items.
---
You act like it's required to share accounts if you run a guild... that's just not true. Millions of people will enjoy classic wow without guild banks and it's really not a problem.
---
Wow players are generally very active especially if you lead a guild and people probably don't need guild bank items unless there is some kind of guild event coming up which means the leaders would be online. There's lots more repercussions of guild banks besides your "cons" list and also small unknown repercussions.
---
95% of guild banks will be used by alts as account-wide banks starting the trend of account based progression we see in modern wow instead of focus on the individual characters. Each character's inventory should be their own.
---
edit* Also it requires communication within the guild and talking to people to get items moved around and to the right people instead of an automated system promoting... you guessed it... talking to people.
---
Okay but once guild banks are in, why can't we have achievements?  What if they don't even put notifications in chat when you get them.  Just personal achievements to keep track of.
---
It's a slippery slope to transmog.
---
i honestly can't remember. i want to say if a mob couldn't path to you in vanilla they would just stand there and evade. i didn't think they teleported.
---
The obvious solution here, and one that will satisfy the \#nochanges crowd, is to play terribly. 
---
Your group rolling through that dungeon a bit too easily?  Send your pet on the furthest thing away you can.  Chain pull things so no one has time to eat or drink.
---
Come on people, use your brains!  We can do this!
---
Gnome - OP
---
It was confirmed during Legion that a lot of tier sets and Lendary appearances were outsourced art.
---
I was sick of it back then and sick of it now.
---
&gt; The point of beta isn't to check every mob's stat against people's recollection of mob stats on private servers.
---
I never said it was. The point is to check that "every mob's stat" is *correct*, who cares about the private server.
---
There were six months between WoW release and when WSG was added, so I'm sure plenty of people got the WSG trinket before Carrot/Loofah.
---
I mean incorporating more action style gameplay wasn't a bad idea. Reducing every spec to 6 or 7 spells was.
---
I super appreciate that response. I never really considered the group PvP aspect. You made a lot of good points!
---
My thought was since I'll have the PvP trinket, I'll be on even footing with alliance warlocks and that stuns will be my greatest enemy. Rolling orc may even deter rogues who could opt for an easier target. I can't remember if soul link was 50% or 30% in 1.12, but if that's the spec you roll with, I suspect that racials will have relatively low impact.
---
As for duels against undead, I'm not too worried about that. A cast majority of my time will be fighting alliance.
---
The point about priests is a good one though. I don't remember fighting a lot of them in vanilla and I was undead then. WOTF and shadow resistance would be really nice in that situation.
---
You've given me something to think about.
---
Deep dark♂️
---
Do you have any idea what ping might be around? I was def considering rolling on a server from EU/OCE that fits better, but my only fear is if the ping would be bearable.
---
I think that's almost certainly not the case. This is a double digit buff to every single boss's damage, a double digit nerf to the fury tank's TPS, and a double digit nerf to every healer's sustain.
---
Do you know why it was the best BG ever played?  Because it was AV.  AV is the best BG ever made.
---
Not at all. Anyone with healing spells can heal all content while leveling, and all dungeons at max level (and into raids), as a non-healing spec. You’ll just be less efficient and have to try a bit harder and drink more often.
---
Exactly, having a guild bank the GM if he wanted could still have full control over the bank themself like it was on an alt, but it gives an option to give officers access to the stuff without giving out account information. 
---
They arent necessary in any way, but it potentially prevents TOS and helps blizzard out and keeps players safer.
---
Yea, same here. I run with MoP challenge gear on Rouge + Champion of Ulduar title
---
I fully expect guild banks will become a thing. I think the people at Blizzard are aware what not having guild banks entail. No changes crew will cry for a few weeks and forget.
---
Based on what Ion was saying, and the log-in falloff from all the previous WoW launches, plus how long it takes to get to 60, it seems extremely unlikely that it even could be exploited, and if it was, only for a very limited amount of time by players with hundreds of consecutive hours played in the first 2-3 weeks. Even then, you would only be able to do it during the most peak logon hour, and only under extreme RNG. Basically, if lightning strikes a wow server and someone gets two Black Lotus instead of one, one time, do we care? 
---
If that somehow in some bizarre world happened, At the rate those types of players blow through consumables, it’s unlikely it would effect the economy, and the surplus would be gone the same day.
---
[i think](https://i.imgflip.com/329jco.jpg)
---
that's a hell of a KDR. of course this was when alliance completely dominated every AV
---
I haven't played WoW since MoP. And the "design" philosophy you described is also why I despise Diablo 3. It's actually way worse there than it ever was for WoW.
---
I hate it too. I'd rather just buy the damn flying license for the expansion. I mean, I have to wonder, is Blizz saying "Since WoD, our content sucks so bad you won't want to play it unless we force you to, to get the thing that lets you skip past the trash content"?  It's like they think that only the dungeons and raids matter and that no one wants to see the overland content... like they don't *believe* in their own product. And that's sad.
---
ETA: I did get Legion Pathfinding while I was playing it, and actually delayed starting BfA to finish getting it. The one part that really annoyed me was having one of the required factions to grind be Wardens, who don't have questlines that give rep. You have to get it all from WQs at 110+, and that is tedious. Personally, I hate rep grinds, so I do not enjoy having to rep grind to get flying, that makes no sense at all towards their stated goal of making you play the content. By the time you get Loremaster and Explorer for an expansion, you *have* played the content.
---
Check potions for twinks. Free Action Potion, Frost/Nature/Fire/Shadow Protection Potion, Elixir of Agility, Great Rage Potion, Minor Mana Oil. Those will sell if you wait a couple weeks.
---
That's interesting. I find mythic+ to be incredibly unique and not really copied in other games to the same level. Many games will just make mons harder but the changing suffixes and prefixes make everything interesting and very replayable
---
You had to dig real deep to find this thread. It was me trolling when I posted it about 1 decade ago.
---
No guild banks. 
---
Figure shit out as a guild, work together. 
---
Become a trusted raid member and have your guild leader trust you.
---
RemindMe! 88 Days

If we're to believe the [Beaza wiki post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bumoii/blue_post_confirms_8_melee_hit_cap_vs_raid_bosses/ephpqyc/), going from 300 -&gt; 305 weapon skill yields a 2% hit increase on boss mobs.
---
Hi, /u/mark_twen
---
I don't think that feature was added until Cata.
---
I hope so too.  Unfortunately, but the time 1.12 rolled around, the only people that were left raiding were those that were near the tail end of Naxx.  So, i don't think many of us know what to expect.
---
And don't forget about Activision
---
Lol at least he learned haha xD
---
And it won't happen again because the same 10 years of decisions won't happen again, because we know what they lead to.
---
Which makes this:
---
&gt;Tens years of this kind of comment got us to BFA.
---
A fallacious slippery slope.
---
It changes the feel of the game. A smaller view distance makes the game world feel bigger.
---
We welcome you as a righteous defender of all that is good in this world!
---
TFW when your face is a single polygon
---
isn't that how they actually looked in the alpha version
---
Figure 8 kiting around the platform he’s on. It takes a few attempts to get the hang of it, but I’ve done it successfully over 200 times on p servers. Obviously it remains to be seen whether any class can do it on official classic.
---
lol, thank fuck the toy train isn't in the game then
---
On the flip side, removing the RMAH 100% saved the game. The game became so much better when you could actually find items and use them, instead of a glorified auction house simulator.
---
A beautiful error that still plagues private servers to this day
---
I should clarify.  I'd rather have layering in the start of the servers over having more servers than needed and then merged after the initial rush is over.
---
I really feel like there's going to be a huge influx of players for about 2-3 weeks, then it will drop off dramatically.  If only because people who currently play retail will at minimum want to give it a shot.  Most probably won't find it to be to their liking and not really play much on it past that.  
---
It is possible that more people stay, and server populations remain an issue, and that phase 2 is coming up and removing layering would cause problems, and what you describe would happen (needing to create server transfers).  However I would put money on the reverse being true (servers becoming much lower pop).  
---
I've been playing on private servers, and with the recent influx of people playing because of the classic hype (me being one of them) has made it a massive chore to do any sort of kill/collect quests, and I would very much rather that not be the case come classic's release.
---
Dispise Diablo 3? Your name is fucking Whirlwindbarbarian. I have a feeling you've played quite a bit of Diablo 3 and you will also be playing Immortal. Also, putting quotes around "design" is unnecessary. Who are you quoting?
---
And to imagine this was post 1.11 where threat/tanking were buffed.  It was essentially the Naxx40 patch.
---
Logging into your account in different locations isn't against TOS. So you really can't get banned for it automatically.
---
Tons of guilds... I mean TONS of guilds WILL clear raids. MC is a joke. You're out of your mind if you don't think people are going to be clearing raids.
---
Mindlessly repeating a 15 year old meta doesn’t make you right, and Druids are better main tanks in 2019 than warriors. I addressed everything you posted and explained how it contradicts the current pserver meta and the meta that is forming for Classic. You have no response so you just reiterate old information from when nobody understood the game - because you don’t want to admit you lost the argument. Get on YouTube and find some bear resources from this decade so you can stop embarrassing yourself and misleading people. 
---
To sum it up....
---
Threat is all that matters now, period, because surviving is easy. With 14% parry, the threat ceiling will be lower than on pservers.
---
Druids are better at threat. 
---
Druids are therefore better main tanks (barring like 2-3 fights). 
---
Warlocks would be the best MT if they could both survive and dish out the most threat, regardless of anything else.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Yes, you wont have too much trouble finding bags.
---
I mean, kek is orcish for lol I think.
---
&gt; For me, it was the game's narrative that slowly made *everyone* the greatest hero of Azeroth, ruining the immersion of feeling like a very small part of something much bigger. 
---
This is the worst thing about any MMO. I'm hoping for one eventually where not everyone even has the opportunity to see or do everything. EQNext had some high ambitions in this regard, too bad that all got canned.
---
We are hunters, they don't pay us enough to know this.
---
While I really like the idea of going back to the state of a burgeoning adventurer, they made a good point that given all the things our characters accomplished over the years - slaying literal gods and saving the world several times over - it becomes harder to ignore the character's prestige.  We've certainly graduated from random grunt.  But it will be fun to be nameless again.
---
For me...LFR really took away from the sense of wonder to be found in raids.  I'm sure people that don't have time to raid regularly really appreciate it, but I can't see why a rushed, mindless slog with a bunch of idiots and AFKers is remotely fulfilling.
---
The other thing is, I love five man dungeons.  But I love doing them in a casual group at our own pace.  I fucking loathe the *GO GO GO* race against the clock of Mythic+.  Obviously you don't have to do them but I don't like ignoring people that *want* your help with them either.  I'm looking forward to un-timed dungeons not being totally useless.
---
Yes, phase 1 is release, phase 2 is the honor system and finally BGs in phase 3. So maybe a year in?
---
It looks worrying to me pretty much.
---
I see the big streams and all the people on one server are layered out so they can't see each other, they don't see the same events on their server. Really dislike that.
---
However I am hopeful with the stress testing that the devs are working towards MASSIVE groups of people being able to be near one another. Thats going to be a pivotal mechanic for this game; if we get capped out at only seeing a hundred nearby then its going to be pretty bad.
---
EQ2 is now completely different from it's original incarnation.
---
Every time: Tank pulls all mobs, healer takes instant agro. DPS damage but dont kill any of the mobs. "Why didn't you heal me."
---
I've never understood exactly why people despise titanforging.
---
I was doing LFR Argus, and during the fight with the dogs I got the tanking trinket, and it forged all the way up to mythic. 
---
It was an extremely exciting event and I carried that piece with me the rest of the expac, never did get an actual mythic version.
---
But the system enabled a really cool moment of loot luck.
---
And I've never felt the desire to run LFR every single week on the off chance that a random piece mythic forges. It was a one-off moment that was really cool.
---
But my friends always take a crazy hardline stance of "No! If someone gets a mythic lvl piece of gear without stepping into mythic the entire game doesn't matter!"
---
Like.... really? Is that really where we are? I truly don't understand the reflexive vitriol.
---
It's fair to say that WoW does not have the numbers that they had. I would said that if enough player sub and the money starts rolling in they might do something something later...
---
The problem with Blizzard is that they move stuff around, cancel things internally at random, change teams etc... 
---
I think it's the real first team in years that I have the feeling that they are listening to what people have to say and are vocal about it. They wanted to give the impression that they are more transparent and people like it.
---
If people back their demands with subscriptions they will listen, if Classic wow is dead within a year, forget about any "expansion".
---
One of my high school friend's least favorite thing to hear was "Sorry! I have jumper cables!!" Especially if they hadn't died yet.
---
Did RFK last night twice as the healer with 0 Int or Spirit gear and had no deaths. Level 28 tank.
---
&gt;14% parry vs 5.6% means A LOT more than 8.4% less threat for tank. 
---
This still applies to Prot Warrior you do know that right? Due to the lesser threat that Prot Warriors do compared to Fury or Druids, this would only serve to make Fury and Druids more attractive due to the innately higher threat that they can put out.
---
Haha okay so stop complaining?
---
Depending on the fight it's possible to vanish and then work yourself back up to top threat, as a warrior we don't always have the ability to run a maximum TPS rotation for the full duration of a boss, so I will always encourage feint in those situations lol.
---
The argument I would consider is that feint cost energy and I would see just waiting and auto attacking to be a more efficient means of holding on threat rather than wasting the energy on feint. If you're gonna energy cap though...then hey why not.
---
&gt;they'll simply stop using it at level 10.
---
Not sure what you mean but layering will be worldwide for the first few months.
---
The range decreased with the deviate fish. Not increased
---
I get about 250ms when I play on NA servers. I imagine it would be something like that for NA to play on Oceanic.
---
Still can't tell if you're trolling or just stupid. With servers comes server limits. They're currently testing well beyond the limit to stress test.
---
Oh yeah. Subtract 100% from the numbers I wrote, right?
---
&gt;and drink more often.
---
I think this is the main part non healers will notice. Stopping the group for mana always seemed to make PUGs a little salty.
---
I remember leveling in vanilla, I was able to get at most a level a night after school. I had no idea what I was doing, but I tried to rush to 60 and it caused some significant burnout given how tough leveling truly is in the 40s-50s.
---
&gt; You act like it's required to share accounts if you run a guild.
---
No... I didn't say that at all.. I literally said a lot of guilds do it. A lot of guilds will do it. It happens. 
---
Can you give me some more Cons? I tried to think of more, but couldn't.
---
As far as account-wide banks go, thats why I stated make the price high. Prevents that from happening for most people.
---
I used to aoe grab as much as possible and purposely wipe the group.
---
I would say Hardiness and Command makes Orc the overall better choice.  You might even find Blood Fury situationally useful.
---
It wasn't for a lot of people, and it also was for a lot of other people.
---
It seems a bit RNG. One person grinded to level 10 (no quests) and got 0 bags.
---
I think it would be cool if they made it harder. 
---
Haven’t really played any WoW since vanilla, spoiler alert I was a fucking terrible hunter that rocked Herod’s gear proudly and never made it to 60. I was 9 years old. One of my friends who I will be playing with started in BC and actually raided in WotLK.
---
I know how to play the game now, because I’ve watched tons of class guides, dungeon guides, everything guides dude. It’s fun to watch them and I want to be good so I do it, but it kind of sucks to think that it won’t be very hard even for me, a “permanoob” as my friend’s geeky older brothers who raided called me back in the day.
---
I’ll be bringing some people to classic to play with me. Probably 5 or 6 friends... and I want them to experience at least a little bit of struggle. Have a group disband on their noob asses for sucking etc. 
---
This all could just be an over reaction though. We want the perfect game, and vanilla wasn’t perfect. It was the best and still is probably, so maybe it’d be damaging to change the difficulty in some weird unforeseen way. Either way I’m excited to not be the laughing stock of my irl wow friends this time around.
---
Altogether
---
That's good, I always worry with some of the posts on r/classicwow that people are going to pick classes they don't want to play because it isn't 'number one raid dps' and drop the game at level 20.
---
this is what i plan on doing until i hit 40 then respeccing to shadow. i also will have a shaman friend who wants to heal so i dont have to do it while we level.
---
EQ was made in 1998, and considering the WoW devs came from EQ and famously flamed the EQ devs for failing to fix and balance their game I think it's hardly fair to give them a pass especially considering EQ2 had better class balance and came out when WoW did.
---
If you want to play that way, you will be sleep-deprived until 60. It will be constant self-imposed pressure to stay ahead of the pack.
---
Transmog kills the prestige of elite loot
---
Are you in the stress test? I’ve played both private server and the stress test and find them wildly less common on the beta.
---
Leveling while hard is really distracting though
---
&gt;  that players have happily ignored during the release of similar products.
---
This is flat out not true.  Bottlenecks at the start of Xpacs (or even patches that release new content) have ALWAYS been complained about.
---
Also, this is to help combat the likelihood of dead servers later on from tourists that dont make it very far.  Dead servers have DEFINITELY been complained about a lot...hell, they still are after server merges.
---
Funny, I said this exact thing, that the game was not ready for mass consumption, and they were using streamers to hold hype till Aug on an 'early access' style 'beta'.
---
People down-voted me out of the thread, and here it is proving correct.
---
The view distance is set at the maximum which was available in Vanilla. The world was not designed for a larger view distance so they felt it's best to limit it to have a more authentic to Vanilla scenery. And it's pointless to let players set anything lower, the game should run flawlessly on even very old computers.
---
Just remember that Vanilla memories are a mixture of earlier patches when the game was worse up until 1.12 and also diluted with years of private server experience.
---
Lol... 
---
Okay so take auto loot option out, take battle.net out, take colorblind mode out, change the view distance back.
---
There are already changes in classic. The changes you listed are completely unrelated.
---
 insulting wow features added after BC is an easy way to gain upvotes on this subreddit
---
Agreed. POE has a better character/skill system, but in D3 you actually see monsters on screen for longer than 2 seconds. Mindlessly blowing up the entire screen every 5 seconds gets a little boring after a while.
---
I was thinking about Tauren. Never played Horde tho so it's just curiosity.
---
I've seen more than a few folks say that it will be used only for the first week or two. I think they are wrong. It will be as you say, or perhaps worse.
---
In Vanilla WoW, we could change the view distance.
---
It makes no sense for us not to be able to in Classic.
---
I'm not saying we should be able to turn it UP, I'm saying we should have the SAME slider that Vanilla had where you can turn it DOWN from whatever they have it set to now.
---
What lvl 20 Gear is BIS?
---
You literally still have to do this with guild banks. Lol
---
Gnome Warlock Master race m8
---
Honor ranks won't be added until phase 2.
---
what's positive about retail? it's easy? that's subjective. i don't see why anyone who thinks retail sucks would want to bash people who want to play on classic though, if anything they'd welcome people into the community.
---
Coule you post the skill build for this spec please?
---
Too bad transmog wasn't a thing yet
---
Just got Divinity: Original Sin 2 on PS4 so that's giving me some satisfying class based RPG action in the meantime...
---
Ultimately, it'll come down to gameplay. If people try it, and they like the gameplay, they'll keep playing. If they don't they won't.
---
What if I don't care if anyone wants to play it or not?
---
Lol $45.00/mo. just to hopefully get a beta key lol no wonder why I’m still not getting one lol August 27th can’t come soon enough!
---
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE!?!???
---
Ok, I understand what you are saying. I feel you on a lot of these points but I lean towards over pop being the problem and I worry an un authentic experience will be what we are left with. If I log into a PvP zone I want to be Abel to run into the same people over and over again. It builds rivalry and relationships. Especially while leveling when you keep running into the same
---
People and fighting them. I worry we will not get this experience which is exactly what retail is. Don’t know anyone and never seeing the same people twice.
---
Flyers were okay to me because it was only in new zones, and it was fairly expensive. Epic was a fortune, and base flying was 60%, meaning in some cases, a 100% ground mount felt faster. I enjoyed wrath, even though I was fairly unfamiliar with Arthas's story. I did learn and enjoy said story, but it wasn't why I liked it.
---
They'll likely have endgame seasons with partial resets of gold and gear, and some form of meta progression preserving continuity across cycles. I kinda wish WoW had gone that way from the start to be honest, rather than raising the level cap, introducing power creep and effectively resetting the whole game once every 2 years. I wish they had just developed horizontally instead, keeping as much in the game relevant as possible for as long as possible.
---
Classic is a grind. It is slow. It is painful (warrior) to level. Dungeons can take an hour to form and get everyone there. Dungeons can take even longer to complete. Bag space is a premium. Tradeskills are hard to level. You look ugly. Running around for 39 levels terrible (more if you don't have 100g at 40). Looting mobs can be dangerous if they die near their buddies.
---
However, all of these things, make any progress from them so much more fulfilling.
---
When you finally kill the last boss in Gnomer after 2 hours, the ring makes all of that effort sweeter.
---
When you complete your tier sets, you feel sexier.
---
When you get even just a 60% mount, the feeling is one of freedom.
---
When you spend 4 hours mining/herbing it feels more rewarding having to dodge/fight for nodes from mobs and other players.
---
When you get an 8 slot bag, it feels like a Titanforged 425 Weapon.
---
The QL changes in the recent game take away from these rewards.
---
I feel sometimes in this modern version, it's the ilvl grind. That's the reward. It's the carrot always moving in front of you.
---
In retail, you casually log on. You do your dailies/weeklies depending on your schedule and you log. Everything is just a button and summon away.
---
In classic, that single dungeon or quest chain might take the same amount of time as the above, but the day you get what you want it feels better. It's not just another 400ilvl item when you're already sitting at 420. It's not an obligation to stay relevant.
---
I was really hoping Mythic+ would recapture the feeling of BC heroics, and it’s probably the reason I even bought Legion. But the timed mechanic just takes any joy away from it. Also, it encourages you to do the version you’re capable of, not the one beyond. If most groups just disband after 1 wipe, is it really a hard dungeon? Or just a speed clear? Plus, affixes felt stupid. I want the content itself to be hard, don’t just throw diablo affixes on just cuz.
---
If you're going by the sub, forums, or even general/trade chat: none of that matters. If you've been on the internet for longer than a day, you're going to know that those places are full of trolls.
---
Now, if you are in-game and you walk up to another person and say "hey can you help me figure this quest out?", 9 times out of 10 that person is going to attempt to help you either by telling you what you need to do or just straight up helping you do it. *That's* what the real community is.
---
I’ve seen some people get really lucky, but most streamers I’ve watched got maybe 1-2 bag drops by 20, it’s probably worth to just buy your bags.
---
Not him, but it lets you know what people have and to plan accordingly. Taking PvP as an example, when you see a Shaman with Tier 1, you knew he was going to be throwing out heavier AoE heals and more mana efficient heals. You knew a Rogue in Tier 1 was gonna have more energy and heal when he vanishes. You knew that meleeing a warlock in dungeon tier was probably going to get you auto-feared etc.
---
Keep in mind, I don't hate transmogs like everyone else. It was added in CATA, a point in the game where there wasn't a lot to do if you weren't raiding and some people hated the longer RP dungeons. So adding transmog allowed casuals to farm old content and collect transmog armor, giving them a reason to keep their sub active and something to do. After raid lockouts, it gave hardcore players something to do as well.
---
It's something that, going forward, kinda needed to be done to keep the game alive and healthy, so I don't think Blizzard made a bad choice, I just think none of that stuff applies to Vanilla or TBC. There was enough current content* in the game at that point where you didn't actually need to go farm aesthetic gear to have something to do, and you couldn't just take a DK and go solo last expacks raid at the time anyway. Transmog is great and all, it just doesn't belong in Vanilla/TBC era due to there not being a need for it from a developer perspective and there being a player-specific reason to not have it.
---
Cool. I always wondered that. Maybe I knew at once point, but that will have been during actual vanilla.
---
Retail is trash noob haha get some
---
The story I heard is that it had begun dying, after an outcry jagex started polls for content and the rest is history
---
i got really lucky on my warlock and i found 3 bags before I hit lvl 11. on my priest, not a single one. had to buy some from crafters by donating materials and tipping them
---
Honestly I like transmog. I think it's a pretty awesome feature. Not in Vanilla though.
---
In Vanilla, I read strats on every boss encounter I ever did, had Deadly Boss Mods for most of them, and even watched videos for many. Many people in my raid did not. Those people are the chalkeaters Sock is referring to. They were a burden on the raid, not because the game was harder then for everyone, but because they were lazy.
---
The game was harder then for exactly one group of people: The handful of raid guilds who were clearing the content first. That's it. Everyone else had all the info they needed if they wanted it. It doesn't matter that there are multiple places to get the information now. If i photocopy the directions to the test 30 times, the test isn't any easier than it was when there was one set of directions. You still need to read them.
---
I had all my bag slots filled when I dinged 10 in stress test and even had to vendor some bags.
---
Actually false. Our Vanilla/Classic community has gotten quite diverse because a lot of people can now see how much better the game is (was) and thus it's attracting a lot of new players (new to Classic, that is).
---
At the same time, old-schoolers are excited that other people are finally realizing this and  wanting to join the bandwagon, so people are more supportive now than ever before.
---
Basically a lot of things are simply a bit overblown on here. Raid difficulties, min/maxing, class/race BiS combos and "BiS" in general. Those are the things that may initially put players off, but they;re really not merited.
---
Getting thunderfury for the whole raid.
---
You rarely visit and already browsing /new? k
---
as if gnomes/dwarves have a chance to travel to SW during a stress test :p
---
No ones gonna keep playing vanilla after theyve cleared nax the 50th time.
---
Every content drought made the players upset. Blizz needs to keep making content
---
Nochanges btw x)
---
The base agility thing scales very badly. It isn't really a significant perk, particularly compared to e.g. Expansive Mind: Intelligence increased by 5% which is always powerful.   
---
I'd play the race/side you'd enjoy most. While I do think Shadowmeld is an awesome ability for PvP (snipping, trapping, etc). It isn't worth it if you don't even like the alliance and would wind up re-rolling anyway.    
---
Hardiness and Command are pretty cool abilities too. Particularly as they're passives, unlike Shadowmeld which is a one-trick pony per fight.
---
PS - I also think the type and style of PvP matters. Something like Shadowmeld is a good defensive ability, whereas Hardiness/Command are strong for offensive play.
---
I wish this was coming before Aug 27, it seems close to being complete. Wish they were fooling us and it was getting released sooner
---
It's fun, in a way, to struggle to get something done. It makes it feel meaningful. There's not much struggle in BfA is the problem.
---
I think you underestimate how old my 486/66 is.... :P
---
Oh. For that I guess they assumed people are not trying to run the game on a dell from the 90s.
---
Only 2 hours... Doing same AV whole day... now that was proper vanilla BG.
---
I dinged 10 and didn't find a single bag. Had to buy one off a vendor 😐
---
I'm completely fine with Guild Banks and some sort of nerfed dual spec (1 week cooldown, unfreshes with raid unlocks)
---
#AlmostNoChanges
---
Like I said to someone else. Take out Auto loot, take out Colorblind Mode, take out view distance. Classic already has changes within the game. These are changes that regard account safety, not so much play style.
---
That is presumptuous, WoW has a varied fannbase with many different desires. Even though I disdain MoP I acknowledge that allot of people enjoyed that expansion
---
Hi, /u/DarkusHydranoid
---
This is just fucking hilarious irony.
---
Vanilla &gt; TBC, though for me it's probably because vanilla is when I was most hardcore into the game
---
And a cheater at that
---
lmao ain't no one around here touching immortal with a 40 foot pole
---
I had someone abuse me yesterday saying never come to classic for tagging a mob. (I played vanilla) these are the players you should put on ignore.
---
I feel like you are overlooking dwarf. Stoneform is amazing (IMO best alliance PvP racial besides escape artist). Removes blind, crippling poison, devouring plague, bleeds from warriors, vipersting, serpent sting, gives you 10% more armor.
---
But between Orc and NE. Orc is stronger. Pet does 5% more damage, and the stun resist is really strong.
---
Unlucky :P
---
I don't get why people keep saying wow is dead? Yes, BFA is awful, but it's still the reigning champ of subs.
---
Ow my neck
---
I think we're on to something. They should dig pretty deep too, it's not like there's any subterranean creatures that will pop out and force the gnomes to irradiate the whole place?
---
Amen bro! I did play vanilla hardcore almost right from the start and also tried out pservers after legion, they felt similar but never quite the same, because it wasn't retail. Now that classic servers are coming out, my pressure of having to invent a time machine has been lifted! As you level up, meet people and perhaps a nice guild, I bet you'll experience the vanilla we always told you about!
---
Give somebody a medal to this wonderful man!🎖╰(◡‿◡✿╰)
---
99-03 everquest would have blown you away.  True class interdependence , specialization , a dangerous world and so many rare items of impact.  You can still see it on everquest tlp's but it is not quite the same.
---
Even eq2 in It's first 3 expansions was a superbly crafted world and a nostalgia addict's fantasy but they never handled class balance or skill bloat well.  Tragedy really.  They chase the wow dragon afterwards and never fixed combat and the game became absolute garbage.  So many games did this after wow blew the doors off of the mmo genre that only ones that stayed true to design principles (ff11, eve, etc.) Really became worth playing.  Honorary nod to Rift through for making an entertaining if a little generic wow lite mmo.  
---
Project 1999 exists if you want to see it as it was with more transsexuals and stimulant addicts.  But these are the costs of progress.
---
Well not trying to sound snarky or anything, but did you ever raid current content Mythic? When I was raiding Mythic it was the most challenging thing I've ever done in WoW and it required a lot of dedication, so I guess from my pov that gear should only exist in Mythic as a reward for people who do it. 
---
Just trying to clarify my point, try to imagine wiping on a boss 100+ times and reclearing it every week for that ONE trinket you really want, only for some lucky guy to get the same or even better version of that trinket. It's obviously not the lucky dude's fault he received the item, it just reflects the ridiculousness of certain systems put in place.
---
It’s more about the people who wants to bring in changes from retail, and they can rightfully fuk off.
---
I wasn’t sure if there were QoL changes that stopped it or not in 1.2
---
I'll give you one thing, the world around WoW has changed significantly and it has made things easier, but it has nothing to do with information. It has to do with better computers and internet connections. Not having your MT dc makes encounters easier. Not having people lag out and run through the fire and into a wall for 15 seconds during a boss fight makes things easier. You reading/watching strats now when you didn't back then doesn't make the game easier.
---
No. Only prep was practicing the route.
---
JOTARO!
---
Deeprun tram
---
Surely you could keep the level cap at 60 and give 1 talent point per level from 1, rather than 10.
---
Chasing someone for hours because you're 3% faster
---
Int increases crit chance. Can you show me anywhere it also states spell power? 
---
This also wouldn't explain why priest abilities do not gain damage/healing on level up (they also gain int)
---
I came into the game during BC and leveled a druid. This time around for classic will be going rogue. I plan to use questie/quest guide (joannas pathing for horde). I booked a week off of work and plan to play around 15 hours a day. Hoping to get close to 60 by the end of the week to just finish it off the following week after work hours lol. I too want to get ahead in terms of gold generation/BIS.
---
i have two 30s on the beta and between them ive had two 8-slot bags drop, both on the first char.  
---
i had two 6-slot bags at level 4 on a stress test char
---
Indeed they could, which would mean that the guild STILL has to trust the guild master with the guild bank if they want to be apart of the guild. You aren't making any sense. 
---
This is broken. It encourages account sharing which is against TOS. Which is completely preventable by adding in a primitive version of guild banks.
---
phasing
---
CRZ
---
CRZ day/night cycle
---
transmog
---
removal of most weather effects
---
LFD/LFR
---
welfare epics
---

---
easy quests (in both distance traveled and difficulty since it's so hard to die)
---
flying mounts @ 280/310% speed
---
homogenization of classes
---
removal of a lot of spells
---
stupid talent point system
---
lack of any true RPG elements
---
the lore sucks
---
the storyline focuses on you being a glorious hero instead of a nameless adventurer

You can save on mana by not healing the salty ones.

Here is my list for phase 1 elemental PVP gear :

---
\+SPELL or +NATURE DMG mail is very rare in phase 1, +CRIT is nowhere to be found if you don't raid.
---
Less than 4k HP is scary for PVP, you'd better kill fast ! ;-)
---
edit : please note that the +34 nature damage of the Wildthorn Mail is not counted in the second link.
---
&gt; I thought sometime within the last week I remember seeing a guide like that, and they claimed it took them approx. 5 hours to hit 10?
---
I did my [Human Exploration route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) yesterday. My time (discounting time lost when a grypon dropped me in Searing Gorge and I had to find a way back to SW and other shenanigans) was 3:54 - some of that data is wrong, and it needs a re-route and update, but 3:30 shouldn't be out of the question. All with almost no competition.
---
At ten: 
---
- I was able to train all the skills I intended to buy
---
- Bought Three 6 slot bags @ 5S ea for 34 avail bag spots
---
- Fair bit of Mail armor from quests
---
- Good hammer from Vagash quest
---
Overall, [in a good spot to start level 10+ content](https://i.imgur.com/wfQaEe0.jpg)
---
Im about a year younger then you, when I hit level 30 on my very first tune, a random warrior asked me if I wanted a really good weapon, obviously I said yes and he told me to follow him. Next couple of hours was spent following him, and then BAM he's like go turn your quest in to this guy, and that's when I saw it for the first time... The glory that is The Whirlwind Axe... Fucking aye man my 13 year old ass playing a lvl 30 warrior with a whirlwind axe, I felt like a god. 
---
I went into BGs (21-30) and just smashed EVERYONE with this OP weapon on a level 30. A single overpower crit was one shotting some cloth users.
---
I hope to return the favor come launch!!
---
I hate heroic dungeons. It´s lazy content that kills the integrity of the world. Also daily quests are shit unless they support minor things like cooking or fishing where it makes sense. And BC had that awful group finder and functional meeting stones that resulted in game theory where the first two to arrive had to port the lazy asses of the rest. Players dropped the group more often now and behaved worse. Flying mounts disrupted pvp community. No more faction identity instead idling in Shattrath. It was a big step away from the social aspect.
---
Everything was dangerous in Vanilla.  Leveling was far more rewarding because it was HARD.  And then there was the sense of community.  And ganking was more respectable since the power differences weren't quite as extreme and it wasn't as easy because you couldn't drop out of the sky as an invisible cat and just one shot lowbies over and over.
---
This was a Wotlk thing I think.
---
Drain Soul doesn’t require the lock to get the killing blow.
---
Having a dedicated team behind classic doesnt mean they have a fleshed out art/gamedesign department to make new content happen. Recreating content is mostly softwareengineering to content creation.
---
If its worth the cost, i dont know, but if i had to guess its definitly worth more than putting up something completely new and gambling on a success or not.  
---
As history has shown on privateservers and in retail, every single Xpac/ content reset has flooded the servers bigtime. If blizzard does the same with TBC combined with a phat announcement trailer, it simply  cant be beaten.
---
The "moment of loot luck" is what kills it for me, personally. I got the Erratic Metronome (BiS at the time) my first time in Nighthold, but the excitement was immediately crushed by the realization that it didn't War/Titanforge. Which meant that I was very likely going to (and did) replace it with the exact same trinket once I got a version that upgraded.   
---
In Vanilla, you just need to pray to the RNG gods for your item to drop. With retail, you have to pray for the item, titanforging, sockets, etc. all aligning. So instead of a few select items that may be similar in power, you're stuck constantly swapping out everything for minor incremental upgrades based on RNG. Same reason people distinctly remember specific items from Vanilla, but I can't name a single item I got in Legion raids besides the Metronome. And I remember the Metronome because of the *negative* experience with that realization.
---
where's the unregistered hypercam 2??
---
Thottbot\* I used Alla bit because EQ, but Thottbot was almost always better.
---
Wat?
---
I mean there are night elves in the picture so why wouldn't there be gnomes and dwarves?
---
i actually think WQ are pretty cool. it gives you a reason to go back to a zone and log in for daily activities. i wish actual live retail did world quests in kalimdor/eastern kingdoms
---
Diablo 2 had Whirlwind Barbarians before Diablo 3 did. And I played enough Diablo 3 to see it as the shallow hamster wheel it is.
---
That's a pretty low bar for what you consider to be abuse.
---
I've done endgame raiding in every expansion.
---
And like... LFR and Normal guys aren't running around in full Mythic gear from forging, at most they get a lucky piece or two. Good for them, it hurts me in absolutely no way that they have that gear.
---
They don't possess the knowledge of how to do the end content, nor do they possess the entire suite of mythic gear that I do from actually running it. They don't have the titles. Or the mounts. Or the prestige.
---
I don't understand why it's ridiculous that he gets to enjoy that trinket. Seems like selfish elitism from my perspective.
---
And Mythic gear forges too. But nobody ever seems to want to mention that.
---
I think its you who is butthurt here :D
---
My paladin got 2 6-slots.
---
My warlock I broke down and had to buy one.
---
they can ride wolves and the zg mounts, thats it.
---
Shield Wall, Last Stand, Rebirth, and Innervate are the most impactful cooldowns for raiding in the entire game. You are taking all of those cooldowns away from your raid by putting a Druid in the main tank role instead of a Warrior. 
---
That might work when your group already has everything on farm, but you're making it significantly harder to get everything on farm. To me, someone who insists on being the main tank as a Druid - even when there is a perfectly capable Warrior ready to be the MT - is putting his ego first instead of doing what's best for the group. 
---
That's not a leader. Tanking is about leading 39 other people, not about mitigation or threat or any of that stuff.
---
Why would you account share? 
---
Just give stuff to people who are on every raid night. 
---
No need for account Sharing.
---
Well it was never really meant as a science, but rather a tool. These following couple of sentences borrowed from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) put it pretty well atleast how I view it.
---
1. The MBTI was constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers. It is based on the conceptual theory proposed by Carl Jung, who had speculated that humans experience the world using four principal psychological functions – sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking – and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time.
---
2. Briggs and Myers began creating the indicator during World War II in the belief that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sort of war-time jobs that would be the "most comfortable and effective" for them.
---
So its a system made for very practical purpose, that was based on "best theory at the time" (just speculation on my part). Personally MBTI system helped me see where different kind of thinking is coming from, and its very practical tool for creating fairly deep and varied fictional characters. The culture surrounding it on the other hand is very "cult" like and tends to garner people who take it for more than what it is.
---
It did never in Vanilla. Only crit and mana
---
**Myers–Briggs Type Indicator**
---
The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire with the purpose of indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions. . Though the test superficially resembles some psychological theories it is commonly classified as pseudoscience, especially as pertains to its supposed predictive abilities.
---

It is based on the conceptual theory proposed by Carl Jung, who had speculated that humans experience the world using four principal psychological functions – sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking – and that one of these four functions is dominant for a person most of the time.The MBTI was constructed for normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences.

---
Lok-Tar Ogar!
---
No idea honestly about racials. But it's horde. You know it's horde. Who'd want to play dirty alliance?
---
Missing my point.
---
Removal of talents. That tiny reward every level made the grind worth it.  
---
There is an entire world, and it's dangerous to step outside of the towns.  
---
No daily chores.
---
There are a lot of things that I like about retail. I love Transmog. AoE looting is a godsend. Flying mounts are super convenient (maybe *too* convenient). Dual spec is great, and each spec being viable in their given role is wonderful.
---
But that's not Vanilla. I don't want to sound like an elitist, but Blizzard's intention is to recreate Vanilla as closely as possible. To add that stuff in would go against their stated goal and would upset the people who want a true Vanilla experience.
---
For all intents and purposes, Retail and Classic are two separate games. Retail is basically a quick mindless snack, like potato chips. Something quick that you just pick up and pop in for a few minutes.
---
Classic is like cooking your own steak. It is something that you commit to, and you have to take your time with in order to enjoy. It's more filling and satisfying, but is also much more of an investment.
---
I'm not saying one is strictly worse than the other. Sometimes I'm in a chip mood and sometimes I'm in a steak mood. Sometimes I want to settle down and engage myself in a slower and more rewarding experience, and other times I just want to veg out with a quick no-strings-attached dungeon.
---
I think it's silly for anyone to say that one is objectively better than the other. It all depends on your mood, your patience, your desire (or lackthereof) to socialize, and your level of investment.
---
D3 pretty clearly copied wow itemization.
---
Wow doubled down with titanforging, tertiary stats, and the removal of hit.
---
I'm actually completely fine with all of those changes being taken out.
---
Realistically though, colorblind mode is a very very different type of change and not really relevant.
---
I hate it, thanks.
---
Lolret
---
These are really two separate changes. Guild banks prevents tos being broken by guilds. Duel specs take out an important gold sink from the game that keeps classic's economy stable.
---
That's where I temper my expectations on leveling - while there will be quite a few people that won't just kill on sight because they want to hit 60 asap, there will still be fights of course. 
---
If you're going solo you will 100% die and that does add up - even if you are only able to hit 52-56 in that amount of time played it's still really good :)
---
Unless the beta testers get off their asses, there will be a new meta around level 60 scrips and console commands.
---
Play around with /console SpellQueueWindow (default is 400, 0 is vanilla).
---
Got anything from Vanilla era to back you up?
---
&gt; you're stuck constantly swapping out everything for minor incremental upgrades
---
Is the complaint that people are accruing power incrementally as they spend time with the game?
---
&gt; but the excitement was immediately crushed by the realization that it didn't War/Titanforge
---
And this is the part I really don't get at all. You got an upgrade, but you were unhappy with the upgrade.
---
Why not just assume that the base level of gear the raid drops is what you are aiming for, and any forging is a bonus? Why let yourself be disappointed?
---
Yeah, especially if the Tank is in T2 geared.
---
Oh, no wait...a T2 geared tank doesn't need healing in Strat.
---
Point is...a rogue bandaging an overgeared tank can heal Strat. 
---
A random, fresh dinged and undergeared group will not go past the first gate area if the healer is a Shadow Priest.
---
I like how I’m lying if I say I’m enjoying the game and that my realm is active. 
---
What has this sub become? Why is it a fight of classic vs BFA? Are you so invested in classic that you feel threatened by the existence of an ‘ok’ retail version?
---
Bummer that so many people here need to validate their preference by continuously shitting on the opposition.
---
Super buggy with mobs scaling the stairs way before they should. Basically, any caster had to blow water between any OOC opportunity.
---
Im in the beta and not a streamer, most people I know in the beta are not streamers. Most of us do have original vanilla accounts though.
---
Yeah Shadow heals is a super interesting route to take, it just hurts a lot that Vampiric Embrace takes up a debuff slot.
---
You also have -15% hit.  The cap for dual wielding is 24% iirc.
---
Im obviously paraphrasing im not going to put word for word the screaching they send me lol.
---
Dungeons only lol
---
I remember the stress of being a healer before understanding how healing threat worked &gt;&lt;
---
Troll...?
---
Wotlk wasn't bad, it's just when the game started to go bad. Don't say that here though.
---
I guess i'll elaborate on the cons I just said above...
---
Most guild banks will not actually be used as guild banks and will be for personal use regardless of the cost. People will spend thousands of gold to have personal alt guild banks and it will become one of the large things to save for like your epic mount. Adding a giant large end game goal that did not exist doesn't sound like a historical re-creation of the past.
---
You are eliminating one of the major jobs of running a guild that requires good communication, organization skills, and trust between players. People talk about how "easy" vanilla raids were but they are missing what actually made raiding hard. You needed a well oiled organized machine to raid 40 mans especially without all the convenience features added to help with the organization. The challenge of organizing and getting guild assets moved around to the right people was one of the challenges of running a guild and one of the many subtle non-raid things that made raiding in vanilla hard.
---
I remember the first time we cleared SM with a group of 5.  Took us close to 5 hours.  My set piece helm dropped, which was the last piece I needed, I died, no one else had a rez spell and 2 sets of jumper cables failed.  Had to practically clear the instance again to get back to the final boss room
---
the LFG tool definitely came out later.  It wasnt in when i started playing (Ulduar patch)
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Finder
---
Looks like it was added in 3.3, which is kind of what i was thinking (ICC)
---
I joined *barely* over 6 months before that.  I liked the dungeon finder when it came out (people were just different back then.  It was an easy way to get a group at first, but it went downhill pretty fast as people changed), but certainly wouldnt want to see it added to the game again if they end up doing Wrath servers ever.
---
Things with +1% crit chance was basically pre-raid BIS.  I think there may be like 1 or 2 better items, if you ran a real long dungeon and it dropped, but the drop-off wasn't huge.
---
It was in TBC when they added combat ratings.  So now instead of level 20 gloves and level 47 gloves both having 1% crit, the level 20 gloves may have 6 crit rating and the level 47 gloves would have 14 crit rating (or something like that.
---
No changes
---
Preach.
---
They can ride Kodos, Wolves, special mounts, and pvp mounts.
---
I would love something like that for classic in 3+ years (give us 30 something’s with irl commitments a chance to relive a misspent youth).
---
A poll to open Outland or something but kept at 60 with the same philosophy
---
I felt BC added a lot of abilities that really added to the flavor of classes, with some abilities really making some specs a lot more viable (paladin/druid tanks, ret and enhancement, etc). If they added all the BC stuff (arena, raids, class abilities/talents) to just the level 60 max I'd be pretty stoked.
---
Which ToS for guild banks? Haven't heard that before
---
you were talking about changing dungeons and raids, to adapt to a perceived lack of difficulty in 2019 with videos and streamers and guides.
---
and I say absolutely not. #NoChanges
---
as someone who played on an RP server where raiders were basically non-existent.......... this was it.
---
Compared to anything from TBC onwards (you know, cause of arena).
---
Depends on the Class. Warriors can use any weapons. Rogues have to wait until 10 or 20 to train swords I think?
---
I agree it seems to be exaggerated often, but this community does split itself A LOT.  There are a lot of demographics at play with the different viewpoints people bring from #nochanges, #somechanges, retail refugees, pserver players, tourists, etc. All told it leads to a lot of competing ideas and generally people aren't the most civil when it comes to arguing on the internet.  I would think (hope) a lot of these will naturally coalesce once the game comes out and everyone can just play
---
How does one stay in the hunters deadzone and stay away from BW at the same time? I'm really curious. 
---
So you just spent 10 sec in iceblock, whats next? He's now at max range and the pet is waiting right outside. So what's the next step? How do you plan on getting to his deadzone AND keeping the pet away from you for the next 8 seconds?
---
Leave it to an alliance player to have monitors of different sizes, peasant.
---
Well yeah, because the servers aren't going to lose 50% of their population in the first month like every Reddit expert seems to think. That's ridiculous.
---
On my Paladin I had three bags (not counting backpack) when I hit level 20. And one of those was a quest reward.
---
Meanwhile on my Warrior, I had found five bags before level 10.
---
So idk, it's pretty hit-or-miss.
---
I think the problem will actually be the elitist attitude of people who pretend they played during Vanilla.
---
Absolutely agree. The 2 most OP trinkets in Legion, Convergence of Fates and Arcanocrystal absolutely broke the game if titanforged. If I remember right, a 920 Arcanocrystal was pretty much better than every single trinket in Antorus.
---
Well written post and I agree with your sentiment.   I found it especially remarkable that the MB indicator of INTJ showed up as 1/5th of the surveyed population when INTJ is one of the rarest type with 2.1%
---
The servers were very smooth with at least 1000 people in a single area(prob more). The blues were derping with the server to see what would happen and to test diff scenarios. Modern tech can handle vanilla no prob. When the devs werent "testing," it was buttery smooth. I cant wait to grind exploration xp at launch....
---
Guilds do it. It just happens lol. 
---
People send mats to the GM for potions / flasks whatever, but the GM cant get on before raid time to give mats to the appropriate person to actually make the potions, so the GM gives account information to a trusted officer who logs on and does it for him.... Thats just one scenario that happens.
---
That’s the point
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
he wants a beta-like pserver.
---
BC would be a perfect expansion in my eyes if there were more ways to reign in flying, like lower sky boxes so you can't fly as high, or items that can drag the mount onto the ground. I love just about every other aspect of the expansion, except flying making the world feel smaller and hurting world PVP.
---
You misunderstand, I had a 7800gt, no X.
---
It’s just a game bro
---
In General chat yesterday, someone said (and I’m paraphrasing);  “If you’ve been level 6 for an hour you really need to learn to min/max”.  LOL.  It was a stress test, who min/maxes a stress test?
---
Yea, dwarves could also be mages back then before release.
---
6 months till lvl 44?
---
This is way more impressive coming from Alliance
---
I vaguely remember him being somewhat dangerous to tanks even on farm runs. Of course, the threat ceiling he creates was also a huge issue.
---
This is really all that matters
---
Yeah just like some of the other changes people are comparing to the guild bank change lol. 
---
My main point was just that there are changes to classic already and something that increases security and establishes something that will prevent TOS violations seems like a good idea to me.
---
It does not really matter if they were well received at the time.
---
With hindsight they were terrible additions.
---
Receiving them well was a mistake in the first place.
---
Filthy mages
---
Of course I'm not talking about modern WoW expansions. Those are not similar products to classic WoW.
---
Not a single WoW Classic server is going to "die" within the first phase of content. You're really out of touch if you think this.
---
That's what happens when you are repeatedly lectured to by Blizzard about what you do and do not want.
---
Yeah man the classic community is definitely niche!
---
I'll add your info to the sheet
---
I, too, don’t want guild banks, but Slippery slope is a type of fallacy.
---
Account sharing. Guilds do it.
---
[Lesser invisibility potion](http://classicdb.ch/?item=3823) is needed for a quest - and even better, [Frost oil](http://classicdb.ch/?item=3829), is needed for a quest, DM:N trap, &amp; AQ40's Viscidus.
---
I also prefer to be inside while waiting during the rain. Glad you're not outside OP! I think I have seen you on funny videos on YouTube, can't recall thought.
---
I wonder why they changed that. Is there some lore issues when it comes to dwarves and mages?
---
Thanks for the effort guys, will take a look at it later.
---
They only care about overwatch, but they also only care about wow classic, but they also only care about Warcraft reforged. but they also only care about diablo 4.  but they also only care about modern wow.  it is known.
---
4 days 20 hours; just shy of 5 days
---
What do you mean? The 1% residual chance to resist even when capped?
---
In the end I do t think the rotation matters that much as long as you deal roughly the same amount and damage and you finish the mob with the wand, thus staying in the five second rule
---
Perfect. Guilds will be even closer tight nit group of people. 
---
That's the whole point of vanilla, to bring back the friendships and community.
---
I will stay optimistic, I’m simply commenting on their track record over the years.
---
How do guild banks correlate with account sharing? I feel like I'm missing something

---
There’s no difference between partial %s and rating.
---
I prefer whole %s, as I think it makes for better itemization decisions.
---
10-15 rating above/below hit cap is meaningless. 1% begins to be noticeable. But likely less of a loss than more crit gains. 2% and we start getting to real issues.
---
I do like haste as a rating, but luckily haste isn’t really in classic—cause haste massively fucks with balance and damage scaling. 
---
The big difference in % vs rating is readability. I know exactly what 1% hit means, what 1% crit means. What exactly does 234 crit rating in MOP translate to? Fuck if I know, but I can tell you it’s more than 233.
---
a lot of bad players will raid and get gear 
---
like a lot a lot
---
Troll female letting them know this. Is. Durotar.
---
The orc male one feels pretty right.
---
Rather than a graceful kick, it's just a boot stomp in your general direction.
---
Yes, Blizzard confirmed all Bind-on-Pickup raid loot will have a 2 hour timer on it. Wonderful news.
---
&gt; Transmogrification
---
Looks had to be earned! Feels very rewarding when it all comes together.
---
&gt; No flying mounts 
---
Traveling the world was a nice thing, you met people on the way, maybe had the chance to help someone, buff someone, gank someone, it made the world feel alive.
---
&gt; AoE Looting 
---
Ill give you this one, this could be nice, but you dont kill as many mobs in classic at once as you do in retail, so probably not as needed.
---
&gt; Sharding and/or cross realm 
---
I can live with this in BGs, but other than that, it DESTROYS the community. Back in vanilla, we had a couple of infamous gankers, when they were spotted we always tried to get them back for the last time they got us, you know people, had seen people before, grouped with them, knew the top raiders on the server and such, you dont get that with sharding or CR.
---
&gt; Dual Specialization 
---
This one could also be kinda nice to have, on the other hand, was kinda nice to have your actions mean something, if you wanted to tank, you really had to commit, since 50g was a lot back then
---
&gt; Raid/Group finder 
---
The worst thing that happened to the community. Why be friendly when never meet the same people again ever? Before LFG/LFR, if you were a good tank/healer/dps/nice guy, people would add you to friendslists and contact you if needed, was very social and the thing i miss most about the game in its current state.

Well, Spriests are a mighty force in PvP thanks to Vampiric Embrace, so it's still definitely worth an in-depth look. I've been trying to compile info myself but it's such a weird spell that there's not much out there.

Cataclysm killed the original feel of old school WoW as far as I'm concerned, specifically the Dragon Soul patch that shit all over the lore and introduced LFR. LFR is now the second worst thing to happen to this game (it was the worst but was dethroned by WoD's garrisons).
---
I have never played an entire expansion from start to finish. Every expansion has irritated me with something that always left me yearning for vanilla again 
---
Flying in TBC was the biggest blow to world PvP and introduced tedious rep grinds but I still liked TBC overall. Wotlk was cool.
---
Boogie2988 touches on that subject. his words were basically "Do I want to play the game that pretty much ruined my life? Probably not"
---
&gt;says the rogue player
---
Ahh yes the righteous defenders of good
---
I thought it's gonna be "don't play it" so you kinda suprised me!
---
Weird. Yet here you are performing the same generalization, more likely a marginalization, of the same "bad crowd" and trying to make it represent the entire community with a single post, ignoring all of the awesome individuals. I won't lie, it kind of feels like you're being a part of the problem.
---
As Sable17 stated;
---
&gt;If you're going by the sub, forums, or even general/trade chat: none of that matters. If you've been on the internet for longer than a day, you're going to know that those places are full of trolls.
---
This. Just this. Anywhere on the internet at any point in time. This. To add to that; Haters. There are People that LOVE to hate and dump on nice things. If it's ANYWHERE outside their closed-mind, they just need to find reasons and convince others to hate things. It's pretty sad. Don't like it? Just don't say anything or go play something else. Leave constructive reviews regardless, but don't leave hate. Like it? Cool, play it and share the love. Basic human social skills that individuals seem to forget or lack. Either way, the game will speak for itself, volumes more than any words on the internet can.
---
I welcome whoever wants to be on this forum, jerk or not.
---
ps; I hope you and your friends enjoy whichever version of the game you want to enjoy. Cheers.
---
Because they probably don't feel the need to preface these comments with "unless you're in a casual guild that doesn't give a shit about progression."
---
They know their audience, they know people are expecting to top DPS charts as Enhancement or Feral and the streamers are just trying to give them realistic expectations.
---
people were tricking the system and would create one layer with many 40 man raids in asmon's stream.
---
Yeah it really is a big time commitment at those higher levels.
---
I remember during my 50s titan panel was saying it was taking me something like 11 or 12 hours per level. 
---
Granted I was a holy priest, it was my first character, and I was reading all the quest text. I'm sure this time around it won't be nearly as bad, but the Vanilla leveling experience was still no joke.
---
Yea good luck having 40 people all on the same page in any guild in advance that all stick with and level with each other at the same place. I think there might be a lot that have leaders and officers set from the start but there will have to be recruiting at some point to fill 40 places to raid with consistently.

Unless you're joining their raids then I don't see a problem with it. They can have their own opinion about how they want to set up their raid groups.

I am sure this will all be sorted out post-launch when people can post recount on how well their chosen class is doing in raids (/s).

Really though, just play what you want and find people you can have fun with.

The point you seem to be missing is that not everybody gives a flying fuck about progression, and that’s a perfectly valid way to play the game.

---
Yes. By a lot.
---
&gt;Wouldn't a blend from these 3 expansions work better? (Keeping the good stuff and "fixing" the bad) ?
---
Yes but that is an unrealistic expectation of Blizzard. A lot of what they think is "good" were things that kept making the game worse with each expansion, starting from Burning Crusade already. Anyway Cata is where it went all to shit. But you definitely could see some really bad design choices already in TBC and Wotlk, like resilience, flying mounts, welfare epics...
---
TBH I enjoy transmogging so I can make themed outfits. I enjoy tailoring's white cloth set, I like transmogging my Rogue to look like a desert vagabond, etc. I can't do that without transmog because lots of those pieces are lower level, but with Transmog I can look for pieces that fit my particular character's fantasy and then try and get them.

Frost Oil, Free Action Potions, Speed potions are constant reliable sellers
---
Omg dude this soo fucking much, I fucking hate when rpgs adds scaling because you never actually feel powerful, I was able to barely ok with how wow did it (still hate it) unlike other mmos that took scaling too serious *cough cough* guild wars 2.

Don’t forget their reasons for scaling is mostly stupid too

Step 1: Create raiding guild
---
Step 2: Don't share your account
---
This has nothing to do with account safety stop trying to justify it that way. Every other change they have made is FAR more minor than adding a guild banking system. None of it is actually in game things they are TINY UI tweaks.
---
what elitist attitude?
---
Myself I really don't care about BFA, Hope people have a great time playing something they paid money for. 
---
But as soon I heard about beta, I bought the BFA (still never even been to the new content) , and paid for game time just to be eligible for beta. I got lucky and got stress test but no beta.
---
My biggest fear for classic, is that we will never ever have classic again. People didn't know the mechanics, they didn't know the world, the hidden vendors, no Auction house strats, People played what they wanted and we just made do with what we had on hand.  I remember letting hunter pets and void walkers tank a dungeon cause we couldn't find a tank.  
---
Now we are going to start with a player base that thinks they know everything. Are used to leveling in a slient bubble.  Ego's through the roof.   Not sure I want to taint those "golden memories" by going back home again.
---
Which is why I decided I won't be maining a hunter, because a hunter was my main in classic and TBC, and I really don't want to tarnish those memories.
---
 The only "good content" tipsout produced was the interview with the developers which was exclusive. Besides the viewers telling him what questions to ask other than that he was useless.  He gets content from other higher rank players then INTERRUPTS THEM to REPEAT the same information, just stfu and let them talk.   I watched him live stream for about 15mins... you stated you'll try to get first to 30 then you started 1 hour late so you stop trying... You get sheep'd and say "if I had WOTF I would win"... complete trash.  Quote from him "I think they did back in vanilla, if my memory serves me correct.  At this point Im simply regarding the mandela effect is so power its so hard to know what happen when."  did you forget YOU DID NOT PLAY VANILLA???
---

Google for disc leveling discussions. Something similar to this at least, and you can still respec into shadow if you really want.
---
Good thread I found on the topic:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7x0o4y/priest_leveling_is_shadow_pre_45_worth_it/
---
I found priest leveling to be all about being consistent and slow/steady. You use wand and dot a lot.
---
edit: changed the talent build
---
&gt;  normal sharding then  
---
If you have logged into Warcraft in the past 5 years normal sharding would include players from any realm that is also pvp/pve and more recently warmode on/off.  
---
Layering is more like the battlegroup system if you had to compare it.  you only group with players in your same layer and when you leave to join a new layer it is because you or the other player were invited to a group.  you will often see people you recognize and you will have a reputation through out all the layers of your realm.  you can trade items and see AH posting from people in your layers.  You can also be blacklisted for being rude or abusive through any of the layers.  All of these points are not comparable or compatible with sharding.
---
The hardcores will roll with the "meta" to try and get world firsts that aren't really even world firsts. If you want to play a sub-optimal spec go right ahead and at some point a guild will let you run with them it may just take a little longer. Not sure why you're upset that some people want to play as optimally as possible its not even an debate that a Fury Warrior will out DPS a Feral Druid.
---
You kind of had to be out of combat to use shadowmeld though, so I'm not sure where you have that idea from.
---
Okay so some peoples goals shift a little bit and now as their end game goal they want to have a guild bank with 10 tabs a filled up with herbs? People be cray, but okay. Yes there will be a few people that do it sure, but if you make this costs so offsetting for a solo player to achieve those people are going to be few and far between. It more than likely wouldn't be a giant large end game goal that everyone wanted to get like thier epic mount or full T3. 
---
I am not eliminating ANYTHING that requires communication. The GM may be able to delegate a task to an officer that he wasn't able to before, but the communication still needs to be there. The officer or GM would still have to make those spreadsheets or lists with all the contents of the bank. Members would still have to request things being taken out by an officer. Officers would still have to communicate with guild professions to get things made before raids. It would basically just get rid of a single point of failure IF the guild master wanted to utilize it.

I don't know why streamers are such a big deal. A group of classic friends had a huge argument about them. They're from EU, and half of them want to play on US because of some streamer, and the other half don't, because they want to raid on EU times (and not at 3-5am during work week). They won't play together.  
---
Just because of fan-boys.
---
Ofcourse it isn't, and you need to put in a lot more effort to be viable as a feral druid. But a casual guild might let you come as a kitty without farming those crowd pummelers. Streamers make it sound like you have zero chance of ever seeing raid content by rolling these specs, and that's bullshit.
---
Omg yes. The last class I took through there was a hunter. With no pet at level 8, they're borderline impossible to kill as a hunter. You get stuck relying on autoattack as a hunter and you can't outdamage their healing.
---
Because they're trying to be top end raiders, top end raiders don't bring along bad specs
---
MICHAEL!
---
Not sure I understand the question.
---
vanilla was too easy. Pservers had to up the damage/hp by a substantial amount  ( apparently) to prevent people from steamrolling through everything ( we still have 40 minute BWL speedrun tho).
---
It's ok. The joke was worth it
---
The only non viable spec is prot paladin for raids, being unable to taunt isnt just an inconvenience you literally cant do a tank swap which is a common mechanic
---
that being said all specs are viable, the streamers are just quoting what happened back in the day, and or on private servers.
---
Yeah I think they need to rethink their spell batching strategy here...
---
I am following your first two steps lol. 
---
But it does have everything to do with account safety. People will share accounts in guilds. I promise it will happen. 
---
The guild banking system is extremely minor in terms of other changes. Lets talk layering. Layering has a much bigger impact on the game play of vanilla than guild banks ever would.
---
This guy just doesn’t want you needing it away from him.
---
&gt; The culture surrounding it on the other hand is very "cult" like and tends to garner people who take it for more than what it is.
---
Yeah, that's the problem I have. When you are doing it as a cute little party event, or you just feel like having fun with an online test, it's fine. But when people treat their profiles as actual prognosticators of future behavior or, even worse, excuse behavior as "just something that ENFPs" do, it's egregious. The test is stupidly easy to manipulate as well, even if you reason that you're technically answering a certain question "honestly". I recall (in horror) that during my law school orientation, they actually had the entering class fill out MB profile tests for some contrived social-bonding event, and I deliberately made three of my four letters as close to neutral as possible while also deliberately making my Thinking maxed out. My score was something like 0, 1, 30, 3. And again, I wasn't actually answering anything dishonestly; I just selected different yet still truthful interpretations of my own behavior to contrive a deliberate outcome.
---
That's what I mean when I say that MB profiles reflect not how people are but how people *think* they are. A test is a reflection of your deliberately or subconsciously crafted self-image at that snapshot in time.
---
Oh yer, that's correct. Although potion of giant growth should work.
---
Lol? No, they aren’t. Last Stand and Shield Wall aren’t needed for progression. Resto druids provide the other two and you should not need any more unless you’re bad. Let me say it again - if you need tanking cooldowns and more than 2 BR or Innervate in 2019 you are bad.
---
What - are you going to tell me next the warrior has to sword and board and spec full Prot? 
---
Bears tank Naxx on Pservers right now with bosses hitting 30-50 percent higher than beta numbers and survive just fine without those cooldowns. Warriors don’t even use fucking shields because without dual wielding they do garbage TPS. I saw your other comments where apparently you also disbelieve that DW fury/Prot is a thing. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Here is a video of one of the top pserver tanks discussing the tanking meta in 2019.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mfG03VQZUYU
---
What even is the Troll kicking that high for? He's the tallest and unless he's kicking another Troll he should lower that kick a good 2ft.
---
10
---
It's almost like 40 random people will be a drop in the bucket of the vanilla population and this literally doesn't matter.
---
Private servers mainly, I do not believe for a second this is what it was like in actual vanilla
---
True, it doesn't really start to take off until after ZG. I vaguely remember switching to deep fire after a few ZG runs and then never looking back for basically the rest of Vanilla. By the time we had BWL on farm there wasn't any point in respeccing because it was so trivial by then.
---
Couldn’t you train them to gold farm for you?
---
They want their guild to progress into AQ, you won't get into AQ playing shit like enhancement or hunter. Hunter dps drops off drastically during AQ (so you have hunter spamming wingclip to proc nightfall) and the tranq shot ones.
---
That's the game, deal with it.
---
Hahahahaha yeah and the earth is flat etc. Be careful you might forget to breath and die.
---
So you think that for example apple made insanely good phones for 3 years and in the 4th one they make a shitty one but everyone buys it because they have the rep to make amazing phones that the 4th one is the best just because it had the most sales despite there being evidence all over the place that it was the worst one? holy fuck are you god damn retarded.
---
If you think the introduction of lfg, trial of crusader, malygos, dk hero class etc. and the fucking empty world were the best things wow created you are obviously mentally handicapped. ulduar was the exception and only hope of a otherwise god damn aweful expansion which relied only on the hype of arthas as the lk and the hype wow did build up to that date BECAUSE of vanilla and tbc. get lost embecile
---
What's funny is that the "meta" shifted so many times in actual classic.    
---
I remember when Feral Druids were considered non-viable, until top guilds started running them as OT/DPS and suddenly every guild absolutely needed one. Or Shadow Priests being a joke, until it turns out 10% free healing actually matters when there's tons of splash damage and limited healer mana pools. Or Survival Hunters that become kick-butt with high enough ability gear.    
---
Which isn't to say that every spec is "viable" in classic. Blizzard just didn't design it that way. But plenty more specs were viable than most people claimed in early classic. I'd suggest ignoring it and doing you.
---
My heart hurts
---
I know back in my guilds in 2004-2006 the GM usually had a bank toon on his account. Well the GM wasn't always available so they gave their account information to a trusted officer who we'd have to talk to if we wanted to get anything out of it. I'd put money on it, that a LOT of guilds in 2004-2006 had account sharing going on among the top ranks due to guild banks.
---
Yeah - during the stress test I had mobs phasing in and out. 
---
That’s not how they sold how layering worked so I’m not really sure
---
I've been supremely unlucky with bags on the stress test. Not a single one between two level 10s.
---
Long way to spell holy paladin.
---
I really hope that isn't the case (the lack of the classic feel/not seeing the same people).  At this point I feel like you gotta choose where you're willing to bet your money on how things shake out (3 months in Servers needing to merge vs servers being overpopped and still in queue).  If I knew it would turn out the overpopped way I'd be right there with you on more servers, no layering.

I just hope that it all shakes out ok. That we get the classic feel, the layering only lasts like 3 weeks and we're all happy in the end, but I 100% understand the concern about its existence at all, and I'd be lying if I said I don't share similar concerns.
---
If you roleplay in WoW I genuinely question your sanity.
---
It’s not just a dps issue... there’s limited debuff slots too. A couple feral Druids taking slots up with rake and rip sounds dumb to me...
---
Do you know what the server limit is? It actually doesn't matter. Server limits won't help with hundreds of people being in each starting zone competing for the same mobs. I mean, unless the server limit is &lt;500.
---
I’ll pm you my email! :)
---
Rating is a meaningless number. A % immediately translates into what it’s doing for you. 
---
I dunno what 89 crit rating is, I know exactly what 1% crit does for me.
---
As an end user that’s my complaint with rating.
---
But at the end of the day, 2% &gt; 1% if you can grasp that, but 91 &gt; 86 is too tough to workout, maybe put wow down and go read a book. It isn’t as though rating made choosing your upgrades some foreign experience. 
---
All that said #bringhitbacktolive
---
well it's a male NE.. just play female if you play NE :P
---
Yeah and beta testers are not QA testers. Of course you can go above and beyond, and go out of your way to find bugs, but you're not expected to. You're expected to play as normal while they monitor the backend. If you happen to find and report a bug, neat. Stop treating beta like it's some grand honor. Just play the game and you're doing your part.
---
So hunters did virtually not exist in raids past BWL? Want me to find some videos of succesful raids with hunters in them?
---
So what you have created here is a place for people to sit and argue back and forth with a 50:50 split of people who no matter what arguments are brought forward will never change their mind.
---
At the same time the devs have CLEARLY laid out their design philosophy which clearly does not include guild banks. Also even if they wanted to change their philosophy it would take an overwhelming wave of community support not this half and half split of #nochanges and #somechanges people. so why the fuck are we even discussing this it's a pipe dream man.
---
He said he had more fun than playing bfa. Idk what you're sperging out about.
---
&gt;Not a single WoW Classic server is going to "die" within the first phase of content. 
---
...I mean, they have to think about all phases....
---
Not at all.
---
We brought our Boomkin buddy back in the day just for his "Secret Buff" as we called it and thought nothing of it at all.
---
Vanilla won't run on that either. :D
---
(There are computers which won't run Classic but can run the Vanilla client, however anything which *can* run Classic shouldn't have problems with the view distance.)
---
you'll lose CB on target switch too.
---
Thank you for this
---
You're funny if you think there will be any vanilla private servers after classic launches.
---
I didn't even count Kara because it didn't share the same zone with a 25 person raid.  Weren't all the rest of the raids 40 person in TBC?  
---
WoTLK was the first raids where 10 and 25 shared the same dungeon. ICC, at the very least, had both 10 person Normal and Heroic modes as did the 25 person mode.  The 10 man raids in WOTLK weren't starter raids.
---
You can roll a hunter 😉
---
All my alts have their own guild bank in retail.
---
I mean it's only 7 tabs each, but sure helps with personal storage.
---
It is bullshit, raids require 40 people and getting that many on at the same time ready to raid isn't easy for most guilds. You'll have a spot. The toughest part is that the "meta" is more widely known now than it was during actual Vanilla so more casual guilds will question bringing "sub-optimal specs" so you'll have to be the best you can be to overcome that.
---
With clever abuse of game mechanics it was possible to bypass the door if this happened. But getting a party of five to do a series of precise jumps just isn’t gonna happen
---
Leveling as healing is fine, easier even. E.G priests have wand spec.
---
Shield up, mind blast into dot, wand.
---
Someone from the beta told me you can't put totem names as targets in a macro.  Unfortunately, I don't have a source.
---
No joke, just a true statement as to why the don't you have phones question was so out of touch with the player base. 
---
He completely got the reference and was not woooshed at all.
---
You posted an identical thread 70 days ago. What happened? Hunter touch you somewhere inappropriately?
---
&gt;Ok, but neither movement speed or boss resist will have any impact on tanking so not sure why you bring that up.
---
that was in response to you saying "literally every elite mob on the beta is faceroll compared to classic". 
---
&gt;but I have to this day not seen any evidence that the bosses will actually be harder in Classic.
---
but now we do have some evidence? 9% more parry, 2% more dodge, up to 185 more resistance. 
---
Bosses might or might not hit harder on nostcore servers, it probably depends on a case by case basis, because they never intentionally buffed anything, they always attempted to be blizzlike correct regardless of difficulty. But even if they did hit harder across the board, that might not mean it's more difficult overall with all this info we now got about classic being harder. 
---
edit: also, nostcore servers sometimes accidentaly undertuned raids as well, nostalrius for its whole lifespan had a nerfed flamegor for example, casting his stacking fire debuff (cant remember name) twice slower than on vanilla, every 10 sec instead of 5. So it goes both ways really regarding overtuning/undertuning.
---
Yeah, you can’t target totems by name.
---
Look, a stress test is very important to check your cardiac health.
---
Why is gnome tje overall better choice for PVE? What makes it stand out over human?
---
Just trying to get a better sense.
---
You've either misunderstood the post, or you've got false information.
---
In the OP's context, a warrior *can not* use any weapon prior to learning the corresponding weapon skill. Otherwise yes, out of all classes, the Warrior can use just about every weapon type possible, minus wands.
---
And to answer OP's question, this is most probably an oversight by Blizzard. Weapon skills did in fact require a minimum level 10 to learn. Not sure why you can learn those at level 6, but you *shouldn't* be able to.
---
Yeah, I'm getting none of that so far. Every single humanoid "attempts to run away in fear!" and aggros like 1-2 extra. I've spent many the graveyard run because of this one mechanic.
---
Remember - PLAN YOUR PULLS. Even during questing.
---
I'm going to miss wall jump exploration so much. There are so many zones me and my buddies left without fully exploring because we didn't have enough time. 
---
And now, the feature is gone from the game and no pserver has ever recreated it. For shame.
---
All these comments got removed about 18 hours ago as of this post. Thankfully I am a master hacker.

---
Here's a wowpedia page from 2006, before the TBC prepatch. You can see here that all weapon skills other than Polearms and Dual Wielding can be learned at level 1. 
---
I'm actually surprised this is a contentious issue, but I suppose I'm just not too familiar with private servers as others are.
---
Taken from https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Mage_PvP_guide;

*Never engage a Hunter in long-range combat in a 1 vs. 1 situation and do not try to Polymorph the Hunter or Pet. The key to victory is to close the distance as soon as possible and get into the Hunter's melee range. The combo Frost Nova --&gt; Fire Blast --&gt; Cone of Cold is essential and should be done immediately try to stay in his melee zone, using Arcane Explosion to nuke him down. Depending on the Mage specification there are some slight variations after the Frost Nova --&gt; Fire Blast --&gt; Cone of Cold combo to stay into melee range. As a Arcane Mage you can maintain melee range by using slow after the Frost Nova --&gt; Fire Blast --&gt; Cone of Cold combo. A Fire Mage can use Blast Wave --&gt; Dragon's Breath after the Frost Nova --&gt; Fire Blast --&gt; Cone of Cold combo. Spamming instant spells like Arcane Explosion at melee range is essential to beating a Hunter. However, you should beware of Bestial Wrath and Traps.*
---
*If the Hunter's Pet is large and red, you are in trouble. It is under the effect of Bestial Wrath; it does 50 percent more damage, and you can't sheep it, you can't stick a Frost Nova under its feet, and it runs faster than you. USE ICE BLOCK!*
---
*In addition, because the duration of Ice Block is 8 seconds shorter than that of Bestial Wrath, if the hunter for some reason pops his Bestial Wrath as an opener when his pet is right next to him, you shouldn't use Ice Block as soon as possible. Instead, wait for the pet to get to you, then Blink towards the Hunter (do it ASAP if the pet is already next to you when he pops it), use some fast nukes (if the Hunter himself is large and red as well, just like his pet, don't bother using Frost Nova here, because the Hunter has specced also for The Beast Within and therefore is immune to crowd control effects just like his pet for the duration of Bestial Wrath) and use Ice Block only when the pet has reached you again. This will waste a few precious seconds from his pets enrage effect, and if you are lucky and/or mobile enough, you will evade the damage from the enraged pet altogether.*
---
*If Ice Block is on cooldown, then Mana Shield and Blink into the Hunter after an Intimidation stun-- since you know the Hunter doesn't have Scatter Shot-- and keep close to him until the Wrath wears off then slow kite him with Slow or Cone of Cold/Blast Wave.*
---
*If a Hunter is using his Traps: You don't want to step on one, unless it is a Snake Trap which you can ignore while spamming Arcane Explosion. Move away quickly (Traps have a 5 yard range) before it can activate. If you get Trapped, use your trinket; otherwise you will eat an Aimed Shot and allow the Hunter to get distance.*
---
*-Trap Note: Ninety percent of the time, the Trap is right under the hunter, or, if he is circling, in the middle of the circle. Use a strafing pattern while remaining as close to the Hunter as you can, and through the course of the fighting you may actually detect the Trap you are circling. Hunters tend to back up to get range and to attempt to Wing Clip or attack while backing up, but use that to your advantage to run faster than your opponent since both of you will be slowed.*
---
*A hunter with gear equivalent to yours will beat you if you fall into his Trap and you cannot break out. If you don't get frozen, the fight is trivial; just stay in his melee range and use your snares to keep him from gaining distance while you nuke him down with instants.*
---
That should explain it for you. Like I said, a really good Frost Mage can still beat them. Paying attention to body language is super important, for any PvP class. I'm generally not a fan of Wikis, but this segment lines up really well with how Frost Mages tended to get around to beating Hunters. When you went against someone who really knew their stuff, this is what happened.
---
I remember warlocks going afk mid boss to grab food while they waited for the tank to get ahead in aggro.  I remember warriors being similar too, but they didn't really get geared until aq40.
---
Might want to consider Priest instead of Paladin, since that opens up the possibility to go Shadow.
---
Shadow is perfectly fine for healing in dungeons, but holy isn't exactly optimal for levelling, and the improved shielding from Disc is a no-no with a warrior (no rage.)
---
Paladin means carrying one set of levelling (melee) gear and one set of healing gear as well, which is a bit of a bummer.
---
yeah no
---
I know I was jk!
---
We have a 486/66 and a Commodore 64 down in the basement haha! Good times!
---
Unlike you, I was actually old enough to play both vanilla, BC and wrath when they were out so I can tell you what it was like. It's rich that you comment on a game that you weren't even alive to play as if you know about it.
---
If only your father pulled it.
---
I'm not sure what part of them you want tested but a whole bunch of the beta players are Private, Corporals and Sergeants. I think Esfand was able to buy the cape and PVP trinket from the vendor. I saw his pvp stats page and it looked like he was ranked first and his bar was about 1/3 of the way through Sgt but I can't remember how many HKs he had, a few thousand maybe?
---
I might be wrong but my memory of fd resisting was it went on cooldown and otherwise appeared to do nothing. Nothing was added to the combat log so it also wouldn't show on floating combat text
---
By "this guy", do you mean me? Because I'm not even rolling a melee character. My main is a Priest, as indicated by my user flair.
---
All this stuff about "best for Fury Warriors" is silly as applied to the Vanilla metagame. Fury Warriors were barely existent in Vanilla. The rise of the Fury Warrior meta is a private server phenomenon, and Ironfoe as a useful weapon for them on said servers has nothing to do with Ironfoe in Vanilla, which had a far lower proc rate than the typical rates seen throughout pservers.
---
It may become the case that, with increased popularity of the Fury spec carrying over, Ironfoe could at least be pre-MC BiS (for those who want to farm to Thaurissan fifty-plus times), but that doesn't mean it *was* particularly popular in the original game.
---
Yup, the debuff limit contributes to the DPS issue as well, but it's all part of the game. 
---
I don't think that every guild will be easily able to get 40 people together (heck back in Wrath/Catac we had problems getting even 25 mans formed and went down to 10 man raiding after Sarth 3D destroyed our guild). Bringing a Feral/Enhance/Ret is better than an empty slot as long as loot rules are clear upfront. The only negative I see in this situatoin is that hybrids will be put at the back of the line for loot priority.
---
I think that if you're a hybrid and you have the sense to stop what you're doing to pop a heal on the MT when the healer go OOM or turn to bear and take over if the MT goes down then I think it'll all be fine.
---
Are these typically valued high on the AH?
---
yeah there is. blues themselve found video with some DM boss + have a 1.12 client they can test values on... surely you've seen both of those by now, but you simply chose to ignore them because for some odd reason you really want classic to be hard... when we all know it wasn't hard, we were just really friggin awful 14 years ago.
---
There are Ret pallys in vanilla?
---
I dunno, it crashed the world server for us and couldn’t log on and do the event for like 6 hours cause there was too many people in silithus. Eventually enough people went to bed and/or left the zone and the event could be done.
---
Yeah the idea of ret = meme spec seeped too much into people's minds. I dont blame em 😂 people built ret pallies so bad :/ I made a comment on it in the doc.
---
yea and no one wants layering
---
I don't want layering
---
You don't want layering
---
Blizzard does not want layering
---
The reality is that layering is a technological necessity. It is not feasible to launch classic (with this much hype and BFA/Classic being same sub) without either:
---
1) Unacceptable stability problems and weeks of queues and not being able to leave 1-5 zone
---
or
---
2) Creation of too many servers which leads to population issues and server merges
---
Guild banks are not necessary at all. They are a convenience feature one of many that slowly did away with the game that everyone wants back.
---
Can’t you just zoom the camera in? The view distance slider just limits how far out you can zoom the camera
---
Would be better if they just removed spell batching if its gonna make looting/selling/buying "laggy" and gonna make flag capture/picking fucked :/
---
Unless they can recreate it as it was originally it's not worth it imo.
---
Pvt server guilds take ferals all the way to Sapph and KT - my guild asks the ferals to respec to resto for those encounters but now KT is on farm status it might be different.  My guild also takes a Ret paladin and shadow priest.
---
The only thing I am yet to see is a Moonkin
---
Interesting to read the differing opinions in the comments here. I've always looped, but you guys are convincing me non looped might be the move.
---
There is a huge difference between partial %'s and rating. The effectiveness of rating decreases as you level up, hence the discussion on leveling up actually making your characters weaker.
---
.25% crit remains .25% crit regardless of level.
---
Please at least have a basic grasp of what you're talking about before responding.
---
Eh, none of those gear sets would have been affected, dungeon finder in it's auto-group building incarnation wasn't introduced until the ICC patch.
---
RE: the heroics, I guess I never did enough of them in one day to max it out.
---
Thanks man I really needed this today.
---
Lmao, we got a keyboard warrior up in here!  Hugs!
---
Edit:  oh, you're OP!  Internet tough guy and a fucking moron.  Bad combo.
---
Pro tip: Do whatever YOU want to do and stop relying on what other people think/do.
---
f*a*ir enough.
---
Ah, fair enough.

Hi, /u/Froggev
---
Indeed there are.
---
Streamers are not gatekeeping that's just how it is.
---
Only 2-3 hunters (in case tranq shot missed), other than that virtually any other dps is better.
---
Yup, this must be the case. Tons of complaining about Blizzard making money as if they were not a business. Really frustrating attitude.
---
o7
---
I'm not reading that nonsense.  Taking your whining elsewhere.  Have fun in retail.
---
Didnt even know there existed this kind of macros. The only macros i made were for /lol and /spit kind of stuff. Tell me more about these macros lool
---
thats just TBC without flying imo.
---
That's good to know.
---
You have been summoned
---
Where my OG Vanilla Plainstriding Taurens at!?
---
That just isn't true.
---
I can't speak for PvP but if you saw someone in full tier 2 they most likely had *some* competence back in vanilla (yes, like today guilds sold runs through raids but folks taking those up were rare).  All the time in the world never helped my original vanilla guild ever get past anything but the first boss in BWL (and they weren't alone there).  If you were in a guild and progressing through AQ40 and Naxx there was a competence component tied to the time requirement.  
---
Vanilla was nowhere near as bad in giving gear for folks simply throwing themselves relentlessly at raiding like release has been for several years now.
---
I remember zomg - I say we bring it back for Classic
---
Not sure what the issue is. They are hardcore/ semi hardcore and no guilds like that will take those specs. If you want to be a meme spec that is fine but you won't be downing naxx you'll be in a casual guild. It is not up to hardcore raiders to make sure everyone clears the raids.
---
soda is hypocrite as fuck, he keeps trash talking about other classes and yet hes gonna play a feral and be carried by his minions on raids
---
Yeah this hunter stuff is complete bullshit. Hunters are fine.
---
I get that, that was kind of the selling point of transmog to begin with, and many people feel like you. You just don't get a good idea of how powerful the enemy you're facing is, and you can't at a glance see if someone you meet in the world or city has done some big boy raids or if he's a scrub if he has transmogged all his items.
---
The early level mats aren’t very valuable, that’s why you should vendor weapons, but once you get into Dream Dust, yeah, it’s a solid income. Much better than holding onto a mining or herbalism profession you can’t use.
---
The only thing that let's me not being excited yet is that i haven't decided for a class still.
---
Nope, I ninja invite people all the time near a quest objective for the tag in beta all the time. They aren't stupid though, haven't had someone think their self worth was so inflated
---
I've been a pretty active member of this sub reddit for the last I dont know... 4-6 months and monitoring it for over a year? And I've seen MOST of the posts that say "if you could make one change blah blah blah" and guild banks always makes that list. Also within those lists not a whole lot of people openly argue with guild banks being put in. 
---
I wanted to discuss this pipe dream and have a discussion about it with people to see if its ACTUALLY something people wanted. I made it as a proposal in case it wasn't a 50:50 split and the community felt the same way blizzard would actually see it and take it seriously. 
---
I think what we have here is a whole bunch of people that are sooooo focused on the #nochanges and #somechanges that they basically hit downvote for ANYTHING that hints at change when what we're getting isn't a 100% real version of World of Warcraft. It will be close, but it wont be 100%. There have already been changes and im sure many more changes will come.
---
Does your wonderful memory also contain being unable to log in for more than 30 minutes for months after release? I wonder. Probably not.
---
&gt; Here's the thing, not everyone is going for first week raid clears and not everyone is going to minmax everything.
---
Here's the thing, some people want to do that, and some people don't. There will be a guild for everyone's preferences and level of min-maxing. Let people do what they want, jeez...
---
Is there any class you want more than 3 of?
---
My favorite thing about Vanilla was all of the little adventures you had to go on just to accomplish the smallest of things.
---
Level 5 orc rogue who wants to use that grey sword you just got off a harpie?  You need to travel to the other continent and spend likely all the silver you've made first on sword weapon skills.  Why can't you train swords in Orgrimar?  Because they don't have a bloody sword trainer that's why!
---
Human who wants to quest in Loch Modan after getting as far as you can in Westfall?  Take the tram to IF and walk.  You'll get there in 20 minutes.
---
These little inconveniences seem horrible when you describe them, but they feel great in the actual game.  You have to go on a little adventure to get each and every one of these very simple little things.  Nothing is given to you.  All of it is earned.  And along the way you may find some great scenery (run to the Loch).  Its absolutely fantastic.
---
In anticipation for classic, i decided to level a warrior in the retail game both to see how far i could get in the next three months and to compare/contrast the two experiences.  I haven't played the game since MOP and not seriously since Wrath.  I genuinely enjoyed exploring the old destroyed world in Cata (even though it made me sad) and thought the under water zones in MoP were great.  Then i got to the dungeons in MoP and realized what an AE face-roll the game had become so i un-subbed.  So....  it's been a while since i've played retail.  .
---
I only got to level 10 before i realized that i cannot play retail.  Its even worse now than it was when i quit 5 or 6 years ago.  It was at level 10 that i realized mobs now scale with you.  There are no red skull mobs in retail.  You essentially go from point to point completing mindless quests against monsters that don't stand a bloody chance in hell against you.  You can pull 3 mobs at a time.  Gathering quests have the goddamn thing you need to gather within 50 yards of the NPC that gave you the quest.  And they're highlighted and sparkling.   Is this what gaming has become?
---
Don't get me wrong, the retail world is still gorgeous.  It looks like it would be worth exploring.  But Blizzard has taken away all incentive to actually explore.  There is no purpose to the game as it currently stands.  It is, i'm just going to say it, a bad game.  That's right.  Retail WOW is a bad game.  I want so very badly to play it, but it has no soul.
---
Nvm, I didn't see " # = Level the skill becomes available if not 1. "
---
I also like the part where you return a flag and get the message in chat with sound effects, then some enemy player batches it back into existence and runs off with it.
---
Vanilla spell batching is great, warts and all.
---
These people are spergs lmaoo
---
Xrealm was an unfortunate necessity because the game was dying and some servers were dead. That's why before Xrealm they start to give away free transfers, hoping people would migrate but it never really happened.
---
WoW was ahead of it's time in term of game VS hardware 
---
-2x2GB DDR400 (PC3200)
---
-4x512MB PC-3200
---
-[2x AMD Opteron](http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Dual-Core%20Opteron%20275%20-%20OST275FAA6CB.html)
---
Vanilla was running on that... for each servers, so you have to assume that they had LOTS of servers because the load was limited. Right now with freaking Xeon/EPIC etc... they will be able to accommodate way more players on one realm creating larger core for each servers. I would assume that we will not see a lot of servers for Classic because that reason. 
---
This will help the overall game to not have to rely on Xrealm, because even if some people leave after while the population per server will be high enough to keep a decent core.
---
Scaling was a direct reaction to [dev fucking up their own game](https://i.imgur.com/tJ8smuY.jpg). They never realized that level is just a number and people want challenge, good content and progression. 
---
Rather than making the game 60 to 100 they made it 60 to 70, when people complained about the "short" leveling they said "Don't worry we made it 10 level but it will take as long as 1 to 60". They made the same mistake from 70 to 80.
---
Psychologically people felt like it was freaking long for 10 level, 60 to 100 would had felt more like a progression rather than a curse. Then they buffed the leveling from 1 to 60 because "fuck this old content people want to fly", then they added heirloom gear and other BS. Because people complained about the length of the game, they wanted to "experience the content".
---
They is NO reason to grind Onyxia/MC/Naxx/AQ if you can just jet pass this gear with blue gear. Blizzard failed to keep the novelty of the old expansion, they saw the $$$ that was coming with selling brand new expansion, and failed to see the cash flow from the subs.
---
Anyway, at this point I am just rambling, I hope they learned from their mistake and have a solid team of dev that want to keep the spirit of Vanilla intact.
---
I never understood the "Action retail" argument. Classic WoW had the best "Action" gameplay in any version of WoW I have played. Fights are fast and fun. In Retail it takes half a raid team to take down a discipline priest, how is that "action"?
---
Dungeon finder was added in WotLK
---
Hope I never run into the sperglord hahaha
---
Righteous-leaning.
---
At least we don't collaborate with dirty orcs.
---
I think thats an actual problem, which is why I said make the prices high. So the average person couldn't do this, because personal storage easily accessible by alts or something like that wasn't in vanilla, but a MAJORITY of people wouldnt be doing this if say... A guild bank tab cost 1000g, the second one cost 2000 gold and it kept doubling or something.
---
The funny thing is that people clear vanilla raids like 2hours after it's release, enjoy that experience lol.
---
The Nelf seems to be performing a leg kick.
---
I was same as mertex, me and a buddy, all the way to 10, he got one I found zero
---
Honestly? This is kinda how I feel too. TBC was probably my favorite expansion. But it had it's problems too (addition of flying, so on). The stuff I really liked was the class balancing, the new abilities/talents, etc.
---
The raiding was top-tier as well, but it's kind of a double-edged sword, as with new "end-game zones" you inevitably split the high level players away from the leveling players off on another world which has undue consequences imo. And admittedly I don't PvP much at all, so I can't speak on Arenas at all.
---
If there were some magical way to add the good stuff from TBC, and remove the bad? They'd probably make the best version of WoW we've ever seen. It wouldn't actually be TBC, but it'd be goddamned great.
---
All private servers I played on had a level 10 requirement for two-handers if you were a human warrior. Dwarf warrior, for example, start with a two-hander so can use it from the get-go, but this was exactly the same on the servers I tried
---
hahaha but GOD DAMNIT YOU DID IT
---
More or less all the big streamers are going on the same server my man..
---
Yikes, people enjoy classic the way it is and dont want to see it changed. 
---
Yikes who would have guessed.
---
Depends if I'm alliance or horde tbh.
---
if i'm horde he's getting it.
---
if i'm alliance, i'm rolling for it because he can do the quest chain to kill VC for: [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2041](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=2041)
---
Edit: For the context of my post i'm the warrior tank
---
Prydaz the shielding necklace?  That unlocked a whole slew of possibilities.  Gave you tons of raw secondary stats so it was BiS for a lot of specs.  Made world quests a breeze because you no longer got dazed because you were shielded.  You could ignore certain raid mechanics because you'd have the max hp to take it.  We pretty much could field one fewer healer thanks raiders running with it.
---
That's why wotlk servers are so popular and blizzard is making official wotlk servers because of such high demand
---
This is exactly it.  I was a late vanilla player who because of gear difference in my guild would be seen as not being a better player.  Guess what happened when BC wiped the slate clean to reset everyone on an equal field and 10 man raids were happening? All those fully geared people who were in AQ or full tier 2 or some naxx gear were put into group A and thought they would be dominating raids. The newer undergeared members were put into group b.  Group a ended up being complete garbage and group b cleared things.
---
It's a good thing neither of those are in the feral dps rotation then.
---
:/
---
The issue with hunters is that they're relatively overplayed for how weak they are in raids. Of course you can be succesfull with a hunter but getting into a guild that does AQ40/Naxx is much harder because you have more competition on far more limited raid spots.
---
Hi, /u/Jamon_Iberico
---
Fury warriors, rogues, warlocks, mages, priest/pala/shaman healers, prot warriors.
---
Thanks mate &lt;3
---
These are some things that were crutual to why i enjoyed my rotation in wrath.  I think I'm going to go with a different class.  Thanks for the reply.
---
Sure, it will feel refreshing to see something like that but are posts like these necessary? I feel like way too many people post stuff like "Anyone else excited for this thing that isn't like retail???".
---
Ret is really good if you completely out gear your opponents, you rely on hard hitting autos and some bursty builds like reckbomb, paladin's have a ton of survivability but just don't have same dps tools as other classes. It's definitely not for casual players, you have to commit hardcore and unless you are leading a guild, good luck getting raid invites and not being expected to heal.
---
&gt; I'm mainly glad transmog is gone because it had an identity-erasing effect
---
I just stopped looking at what everyone was wearing because it didnt matter, there was no more stopping and admiring a cool outfit because it took time, not effort to get it. I didnt care if someone was on a flaming winged frog that farted rainbows because they ponied up real $$$ at the cash shop.              
---
               
---
Transmog gave me the choice to look how I wanted and at the same time took away my enthusiasm for changing how I looked.
---
Right, but then I just saw a human warrior with a 2h sword at level 6.
---
Maybe they're weak and not attending, because they aren't getting anything, did you ever think about that?
---
PvE wise : BC.  
---
PvP wise: Vanilla. Flying mounts killed world PvP.
---
Agree,
---
The good thing about vanilla style servers is if you are a Richard word gets around, same thing if you are a good guy
---
You're delusional if Blizzard will allow a direct competitor to an active product of theirs. After classic launches, Vanilla Pirate Servers are done and over with, forever.
---
Right in the feels... :(
---
Ulduar was amazing
---
You can heal anything until raids as DPS spec. You just need to carry a healing set to swap to
---
Correct. Wait a few years and see. They'll release BC first, and then WOTLK and then stop since everything after WOTLK was shit
---
Classic is the best
---
for realz?
---
Exactly this. I loved arenas in tbc even though it was quite unbalanced. Biggest mistake was to trying to make wow E-sports game and balancing everything to blank shit. And loved arenas even though i was shite at them and didnt play any op classes.
---
If you know your way around gnomer you will probably like it. It's one of the true dungeons. Lots of bosses and a huge map.  Disarm those bombs or it's a wipe. Not many other early instances had this mechanic.
---
&gt; As pure vanilla/tbc guy who loves pvp, how do you guys on retail determine the difficulty of your opponent
---
Gear scaling in PVP means gear barely affects your power level. It's a ridiculous mechanic that ruins the entire concept of WoW for me.
---
Probably not just because it's such a grind, and inevitably you're going to get gear drops on one that you wanted for the other and it just doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
I really like this, i really like seeing the spread of personalities. the data might represent the desired personality of an individual, but that makes it no less interesting. 
---
I ended up testing as an ENTJ, make sense as my aspirations for classic are creating and running a guild.
---
If you have four of each of those you have 24 people. What do you do for the remaining 16? What if there’s not enough of these classes / specs online?
---
And the guy playing feral cause he doesn’t care about min maxing is going to follow the perfect rotations. Nice logic.
---
Yup. There are more of em than enhancement + elemental + boomkins combined.
---
Really gets the noggin joggin, as if internet-dwellers covet the INTJ moniker and really like to say they're INTJs or manipulate whatever test they're taking to get INTJ and show off. See it all the time on particular forums.
---
there's no lore issues. some people speculated that the dwarves in vanilla (IF/bronzebeard) couldn't use magic but that isn't the case. they probably just took them out for the same reason they didn't want human hunters--they wanted certain races to be able to only access certain classes
---
PvP was 10000000x better in vanilla. It had a far superior Map. Instead of being split between 2 continents, there was now 2 continents + off-world which split the playerbase. Flying mounts was the final nail in the coffin to World PvP. Arenas were absolute garbage, always have and always will. Have you seen pro level arena or played them much? 99% of the game is LoS maneuvering, boring as fuck. Arenas could have been great if designed like Gurbashi Arena, just a wide open circle. Also Arenas ruined the game long-term because everything had to be "balanced", leading to homogenization. 
---
Druids/Paladins/Shamans were amazing in Classic, they just couldn't hit as hard as pure DPS but could heal for a lot, that's a fair trade. 
---
I don't know much about professions in TBC, but I can't imagine them being better than Vanilla. Every profession was amazing for its own reasons. 
---
Like I said, the only thing TBC had was end-game raiding.
---
Layering is going away before AQ im quite certain so it won't be a problem.
---
Multiboxing or one char for pve gold farming while the other bg's.
---
From my understanding, since it is vanilla, the dark iron dwarves have still not yet joined the alliance, as they are ruled / controlled by ragnaros. 
---
Later in the lore and game, the dark iron dwarves join the alliance (Moira serves as the representative for the Dark iron dwarves on the Council of Three Hammers and is the rightful heir to the throne of Ironforge) and they teach the other dwarves how to use magic, something they were opposed to and resisted (hence their racial passive resistances in vanilla). 
---
This is when dwarves we're able to become warlocks or mages afaik.
---
Lets wait to see how classic actually does before we get ahead of ourselves lol
---
I get what he was trying to say, he just should have worded it in a way that’s a little less “it puts the lotion on its skin”
---
blizzard expects player numbers to not be very big
---
i actually have no idea how many will be playing 6months after release its super hard to gague, it could die down a lot or blow the fuck up
---
\- Transmog: I want to see what gear people actually wear, both in cities and the world (pvp). Having transmog deletes this extra information, for good or worse, in favour of fashion design - no thanks.
---
\- Flying: It makes the world smaller, and it kills world pvp since people can always get away to a SAFE SPACE. Getting to places is part of what makes classic have a slower pace of gameplay. You are much more immersed, and more inclined to group up with people. You can get lost in the wilderness or get stuck in a dangerous outdoor dungeon. These adventures are all lost with flying. Part of what makes running feel slow and boring in retail is sharding and the general lack of good world pvp.
---
\- AoE looting: It just increases the gold/hour from farming for everyone, which is meaningless, because prices on consumables would just go up. Part of the problem of retail is that it wants to cut out all the "grindy" things like travel time, loot time, dringking/eating time, but paradoxically, you get a much grindier experience: kill-kill-kill instead of travel-kill-loot. AoE looting wont change anything, looting individually is part of the hard work that getting gold in classic wow is. Ok, AoE looting isn't the worst, but I am still against it for classic. It would also help mages too much.
---
\- Sharding: It is exploitable, rediculous, it kills immersion. It also kills every kind of group play that isn't planned in advance - in other words, sharding kills the world. With sharding, nothing is real anymore. You don't say hi to random people, because they are going to shard in a second. Also, you don't need their help what so ever.
---
\- Dual spec: Having dual spec makes your character choice less meaningful, in that you can always switch to suit the situation or your mood. In other words, with dual spec you can do more. This erodes class fantasy and individual character customization. It erodes the individual weaknesses and strengths of characters, making them less dependent on others, hereby taking away from the mmo aspects that I love about classic. Dual spec isn't the worst, but it is one more step on the slippery slope.
---
\- LFD/LFR: Again it's an "optimization" that makes the game insanely grindy, non-immersive, unpersonal, unrewarding, spammy and repetitive. Instead of travel-worldpvp-dungeon you get the kill-kill-kill faceroll, a mind numbingly idiotic dungeon spam that is LFD and the toxicity-soup that is LFR. Mythic dungeons are excempt but they are still pugged via some cross-realm unpersonal group finder that reduces characters to a single number: ILVL, exacerbated by the fact that you will never meet these losers ever again.
---
\- EXTRA: Itemization: Itemization and character progression is as much a problem for me as all of the above. Retail itemization is completely unreal - damage is rescaled with character levels in the worlds as I understand it, so if a lvl 3 meets a lvl 9 they do the same damage anyway. It's meaningless, therefore unreal, and therefore uninteresting. What's more, power creep is insane in retail, which is why you never get to know your gear, and why they had to rescale pvp. Yet even with increasing power levels you still do the same dungeons over and over, just at a higher difficulty. So you get better, but you don't feel it because mobs just get harder?? They reduced all item choices to one stat: ILVL. This system of patchworks, workarounds, constant upgrades, one-dimensionality, exceptions, RNG and world scaling is absolute garbage. (Ok I don't know exactly what they did in BfA, but I haven't heard good things about it either, by comments are based on Legion.)
---
Classic itemization is REAL in the sense that what you see is what you get. It has +100 damage? That's the same damage you'll do to players in world pvp. That consistency forces gear designers to keep it real and avoid the ridiculous. (Until it does get ridiculous come naxx, at which time I reroll on fresh.)
---
See, a reasonable comments with not hard feelings, enjoy:-)
---
I've found 2 bags while leveling my T druid to 30 on Beta. However, I bought 6 slots (5s/per) and later 8 slots (25s/per). Totally worth it imo.
---
Found one so far leveling UD priest to 10.
---
ummmmm, do you need me to explain how abilities work?
---
You're bold to think that classic will have more players than retail.   Im hype as fuck for classic, but I fully understand that a VERY large portion of players will stop after a month or so due to them not understanding how much of a grind it actually is.
---
Beta - not that I think the stress test realm has different loot tables. I could be wrong, haven't played on it.
---
so they are the most popular of the meme specs?
---
Cool looks like fun. I cant even get into a stress test.
---
it's not in the debuff area, it's changing the color of my character's portrait in the unit frame (and on the character sheet when i press 'C')
---
Honestly dunno what you're talking about, guess you like drama or such? Only seen ppl happily discussing old memories and how great its going to be to be back.
---
I don't remember what it was to get other races mounts. Was it getting exalted with them and then purchasing for the same price they could buy it prior to exalted? Or can you outright buy it from them but just for more gold? For example I will be an undead rogue but wish to have a raptor mount lol.
---
Path of Exile content drops on the 7th.
---
League of Legends can also be fun if you want to get told to kill yourself / you want to tell people to kill themselves.
---
Believe it or not, a well built retri is indeed very viable. A lot of misinformation was spread about retris.
---
In my personal opinion, WOW reached it's zenith in Burning Crusade.  Vanilla is probably as good IMO at best.  Wrath was still a great game but it was the beginning of the end.  
---
If classic is as successful as i hope it is, there will be a time for both of those expansions to come to reality.
---
I was mainly curious because I was wondering how tf you would level that many characters to 10 in less than 24 hours lol
---
More power to you if you play ret, just know that you are inferior to holypalas even in bursting in pvp.
---
8 or more warriors, phew. Gonna take them five years to get a full tier set
---
Oh I know the streamer hate is real, it's just the wording on this particular one seemed like it could be satirical.
---
Rogues can train weapon skills at level 1 in the Beta if they have the funds to do so. I can’t speak for other classes.
---
After soda display in SM cathedral i wouldnt put to much faith in his words about PVE.
---
I killed a lvl 1 critter in the stress test, I literally felt more challenged and accomplished when I killed that critter then why I got world first mythic jaina...
---
That’s crazy am I right guys?!?!
---
[One of my favorite quotes.](https://www.yayomg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/yayomg-adventure-time-quotes-5.jpg)
---
Tank threat governs the maximum dps the entire rest of the raid is allowed to do.  If tank's threat is low, then the entire rest of the raid has to limit their dps so as not to pull the boss and wipe the raid.  This increases the risk the raid won't kill the boss, either healers go OoM and you wipe, or the longer the raid goes the more likely mistakes will be made and you wipe to them.  
---
So, maximizing tank threat is one of the highest priorities of any serious raid (and in vanilla/classic, there was no other kind of raid, no LFG or anything easy).  The problem with choosing NE is not only do you lose Human's +5 weapon skill which significantly increases tank threat, but NE's +1% dodge causes reduces your rage generation (you don't gain rage on dodge).  So your threat ceiling is automatically lower with a NE tank than with a human.
---
If you don't plan to raid and only do dungeons and PvP it may matter less.  But also keep in mind that in Classic/Vanilla, NE's Shadowmeld doesn't have the cool feature that causes it to break combat.  That was added later.  So NE's don't have a huge advantage over Humans PvP either.
---
&gt; carrot on a stick
---
had a mod to equip on mounting up, LUDICROUS SPEED, GO!
---
That's bad ass. I wish I made a model of mine back then :(
---
basically it worked like a /target macro for finding a NPC eccept you could put a totem name in it and when you spammed the macro it would cycle threw finding a totem and sending a pet to attack it.They were very broken from a standpoint that it allowed mages, locks, and hunter to simply destroy shaman totems without having to actually see and click on them and hit a button to send the attack
---
this includes prot and fury, fury warriors do not really use the warrior tier sets outside of t2.5.
---
That is not correct at all. That's the Max Camera Distance slider.
---
View Distance sliders effect how far you can see before it gets foggy.
---
Have you ever had an idea that didn't pan out, so you cut your losses and came up with something that fits better?
---
macros really are sight to behold nowadays. Makes warrior stance dancing as braindead as can be.
---
write a overpower macro and it asks the game if you are in battle stance. If you are not it puts you into bstance, 2nd tap and it performs overpower. Can be written for all abilities that need a certain stance like taunt, intercept etc.
---
Really takes away from stance dancing but its so very supeior so you are pretty much bound to use these macros if they are available.
---
Then don't play with them, find a lower less serious guild that are happy to take their time and let people play with sub optimal builds that put the group at a disadvantage. 
---
Why should people who want to take the game really serious be forced to play with you if you're not taking it serious?
---
Any chance to see the new results? Thanks mate :)
---
I would guess MC will be a total joke for any retail players.
---
I would also guess guilds will still have issues with Razorgore and Vael.
---
[.2% drop rate btw](https://web.archive.org/web/20110426071226/http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b195/matrix1matrix/Hyunkil-ironfoe.jpg)
---
It was an amazing experience. I was like "Oh no!" at first. How can we defeat so many mobs? But then we did it and it felt epic.
---
Best comment in this sub all week. You should turn this into a post.
---
Still, big competition for gear. Wouldn’t want to play warrior in raids
---
Oh... oh well.
---
I’ll bring the player. If they can make it work, show up and have a positive attitude, don’t care about where they put their points unless it’s to cover an improved buff. (Which will already be discussed before the first team goes into the first pull of the Guild Raid.)
---
There were a lot of bad players the first time around and the good players outshined them. I’ll be curious to see how it will be different. But then again, I haven’t been idle, did lots of research on hybrids and meme specs, thanks to Private server data.
---
In keeping an open mind and will do lots more research and try things out and let the meters tell the story factoring in the benchmarks of the class limitations. (IE- caster dps is lower in the first tier)
---
hahaha thank you! yea, really beings back the memories ;-;
---
Early for Black Friday ? 
---
such a good screeny !!
---
Blood Elf &gt;.&lt;
---
Kidding, looks sick! :P
---
They removed dwarf mages because they wanted to have the amount of race/class combos be equal on both factions.
---
Human hunters, undead hunters, blood elf warriors and troll warlocks were also unavailable for a similar reason. They were all lore-friendly options, it's just that until Wrath and Cata, they didnt want races to have more than 6 classes. Maybe it's for balance reasons, maybe it's due to the character creation UI.
---
It was either you guys (i think) or Crooklyn Clan or staying with RTZS; those were my choices at one point in classic. 
---
Then i jumped ship and played with Adelante at the beginning of BC. Got burnt out on raiding and went to another server to play with RL friends.
---
Viable for what content exactly?
---
It's not that bad, craftable gear is huge for a while. Yeah it's competition and all but usually loot council is the way to go.
---
"You shouldn't need Innervate and Rebirth unless you're bad" - then why care about optimal tanks in the first place? Clearly you're so good at this game that it doesn't matter what you do. Might as well just tank with a Mage.
---
I had several paladins across a few servers to play with friends. Only ever got the one to max tho
---
This exactly. I suspect that the first day, the first weekend, there’s gonna be a ton of people playing simply because it’s novel. But what those numbers look like come phase 2 is gonna be a whole different story. Exactly why layering is so important to get right.
---
Master race..
---
I really dont get how people are forgetting how much people didn't like legion that much actually during legion. Legion had a wave of content creators all talking about why they were quitting the game, pvp was the worst its ever been in wows history (even WoD was better), it had the titanforging and warforging BS and the random item RNG, not to mention how dumb the legendary item system was, artifact power was a pain in the ass grind just like azerite except until they fixed it halfway through the expansion it locked you into one spec and made it hard to have alts, and more. 
---
It did introduce new questing which was cool, class halls were a cool idea, although gating your ability to progress your own class hall behind an artifact power grind or having to wait days and weeks for research was pretty aids, mage tower was good, and the raids were aight. But the core of the game still was bad and feels pretty much the exact same in BFA yet people say BFA is shit and Legion was amazing for some reason
---
It's not just about the numbers feeling easier to grasp. They could do that in retail with the next expansion, without an issue.
---
The problem is that they've introduced too MANY new stats to the retail game that they haven't the faintest idea how to balance appropriately. It leads to the nightmare we currently have where stat values change all the time, and you need 3rd party programs to simulate upgrades otherwise you'll never be able to figure out what to do. Item level upgrades aren't upgrades because they have [UNDERVALUED "SECONDARY" STAT] on them which sims higher than your MAIN stat. Add something like Azerite Traits to that situation and you have a recipe for stat disaster.
---
They will never be able to fix this issue on retail servers until they dump Haste/Mastery/Vers alltogether (Which they're not going to do). They need to put the effort into unlinking these from secondary stats, and make them scale with main stats, and then dump them alltogether.
---
They had a working system, and over the past 10 years have done too much to mess with that system. I cannot wait to go back to the simpler stats.
---
Hey...fuck you man. Horde is for the emo kids. C'mon.
---
Thanks
---
Yes, every 3 minutes. Divine Favor + spell power trinket + meteor is a nice combo, but it only lasts for so long. A good deep ret can push out very good damage, at times even oneshotting people.
---
Yeah. I remember that specifically. It was just an endless wave of mobs that you couldn't keep up with.
---
As a horde main that first began on alliance, I gotta say, *dat stormwind music gud.*
---
No it was added at the end of TBC. It was an archaic version though. As I said though. I didn't mind it as much in TBC because it didn't influence the dungeon design.
---
Am I miss remembering? You had to be out of combat to use shadowmeld?
---
Classic will have a crazy opening for sure... but how many people will stick around beyond their initial sub?  Well, that's harder to say.  People that played vanilla and are coming back are also in very different stages of their life.  And vanilla was a time sink.  People will revisit for nostalgia, but how many actually stick around to do those 3 hours BRD/S grinds, or 3 our raid nights, or just log in to do the raid prepping and all of that stuff... I mean, I know I won't.  I am excited for classic, but the more I think about it, the less I think I would actually be there for more than a month if that.  I just don't have the time for a hardcore mmo and I think a lot of people are in my same boat.
---
As for the younger crowd that picked up WoW later... most of them honestly won't like Classic that way you think everyone will.  There is a reason why casual mmo's took over.  How many hardcore mmo's came after vanilla that stuck around for more than a year or two?  Many tried, but ultimately, the wave of the future in MMO's was to cater towards casuals.  So it is my assumption that many people will return to retail once they see how much of a time sink vanilla was.  For me and the stage of life I am at... retail probably suits my needs way more than classic will... that is if I were to ever pay a monthly fee for a mmo again.
---
When I pugged I always made my consumable gold by selling fireprotpots for high prices right in front of Ony or Rag, because people got loot banned for not using them.
---
So normal price is 2g? Better cough up 4g50s for each potion. Most raids I sold 10+.
---
Damn they just asked for a character name and a picture of my id for me
---
guilds would make an alt account, just to be guild leader and banking alts and then share it between guild officers.
---
"Dem call me Bushmaster!"
---
This is something my buddies and I are struggling with right now.
---
I don’t wanna waste my few days off to level a character I don’t like so I feel like I gotta be exact with my choice.
---

Fuck the horde. Alliance all day bb.

Hi, /u/lil_scuffed2, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
&gt;Private server creators literally had to guess at how some mechanics worked which created a much easier experience than the original.
---
How do you make this assumption that just because something isn't accurate, that it's somehow guaranteed to be easier? That's not how guessing works...
---
So you are okay making someone play a certain way for the best outcome... where have I heard that before?!
---
so what? your plan is to just give out .25% crit on your average item throughout vanilla, up it to .5% crit in bc? Thats nonsense and horrible design.
---
The only downside to rating is the gymnastics it takes to convert XXX rating into a meaningful number, say 1.43%. 
---
I don't like it aesthetically i think %s feel better. but its a brilliant solution to the issue of old gear being overvalued because a crit % maintains its value. 
---
If anything, keep % for the live shit, and convert to rating previous expansions gear.
---
Yea but do you really think they can have Arenas with out huge pressure to homogenize the classes for balance? That's my issue. I'm okay with it as a fun distraction but, the fact it's tied to the best pvp rewards and you have to have a high rating to get them. Means homogenization is inevitable.
---
if outlands had no flying mounts(there would be ways  to get to places that required them like teleporters or flypaths) and there was one more starting zone other than hellfire  -  it would make bs the best but with flying vanilla is better - i absolutely love bc heroics and arenas
---
Where did you get this made? I'm hoping there are still companies around who do this sort of thing
---
Warrior thins out cause people give up. Be the warrior you are destined to be!
---
That's because you haven't experienced it for years. It's exactly how it was in vanilla. It felt awful.
---
Makes me wonder whether the servers will be playable for the first month or so with how many people are going to be on the hype train. Should I just delay my classic start time a little? Going to be so few mobs for the early leveling stages..
---
Also, has Blizzard specified how many classic servers there will be at launch?
---
It will not exceed retail.
---
There is a keyring/bag, it's exactly the same thing.
---
These arguments have been going on for years and years. This isn't a classic wow thing, but a vanilla wow thing. The frustration comes because the original members of the community (the private server scene) has already solved this many years ago. What works best was and is an identical re-creation of vanilla wow. Most banded together and settled that #nochanges as the best approach to come together and compromise because there are WAY to many opinions of what little change would just make the game better but not change the magic juice that made it great.
---
We have seen it just in this thread...
---
You compare guild banks to small UI changes like battle.net and colorblind mode and say that guild banks are one more logical step.
---
but bring in another opinion like:
---
"and some sort of nerfed dual spec" and then WOAH WOAH you are like pop the brakes sonny jim we can't have none of that that's #TOOMANYCHANGES and I only want #SOMECHANGES but really what we need is #NOCHANGES but I want these #SOMECHANGES and these #SOMECHANGES are not #TOOMANYCHANGES. Uhh yes that is #TOOMANYCHANGES but my opinion of #SOMECHANGES is not #TOOMANYCHANGES.
---
You see where this goes... so let's just settle on #NOCHANGES
---
For all of em. Its expensive and a long grind, getting pre raid gear is miserable, but when you are finished, it is very viable. Im not joking when im saying that you are a consistant top10 dps, you can even be top5 if you are at the top of your game, even in semi hardcore guilds. Ultra hardcore wont take you in obviously, they are going for all the warriors on your realm.
---
I could see not hating flyers if you played on a pve server. However for me they were a disaster. Sporadic unplanned world pvp is life in wow. TBC had almost none. People just mounted up and flew away.
---
I'll intend to roll both a Horde Warrior and an Alliance Warrior. I'll end up favoring one ofc, but I like having both.
---
Remember to talk to the goblin first at the end of the stairs, or no boss for you!
---
Transmog: there's a feeling of progression from starting out as a hobo in suspenders to a clown set of dungeon plate to a matched 8/8 T2 tank. When everybody can pay 1g for their lowbie alt to look that awesome it kind of ruins the immersion of overcoming the odds. When you're finally decked out in sweet armor and you help a buddy by tanking BRD and the other people go "oh shit look at his gear" it makes you feel good.
---
No flying: easy, it makes the world feel smaller and much less dangerous when you can just alt-tab fly to your quest, land on the item you need to loot and fly away unscathed.
---
AOE looting: probably the least offensive but time spent looting was a conscious choice when they designed the game. You don't notice all of those regen ticks but they help you out. It also helps balance out some of the farm spots by making them take longer. Is it more valuable to loot 50 cheap bodies or 8 expensive ones?
---
Sharding: it's a solution to make the game feel less empty for players on dead servers and to help busy servers thin out the crowd. I don't think it should be in Classic outside of the starting zones but that's a whole can of worms.
---
Dual spec: being a more efficient dungeon or grinding or pvp spec has its advantages, this is the trade off. It's a big gold sink for when endgame players have nothing better to spend gold on.
---
LFG/LFR: this basically kills any desire for casual players to go out and engage with the world past level 15. Why do all that questing when I can sit in Orgrimmar and talk shit in /2 between dungeon queues? Having all of the quests at the door and the big bonus XP makes it even more efficient to sleepwalk through Stockades for the 100th time and get handed scaling ilevel blues.
---
3 silver takes 500+ hours of gametime in classic ;)
---
I always did it by just looking along the side of the way i wanted to land on. i got really good at it, don't remember ever having to face in a cardinal direction.
---
It was exactly like that in Vanilla. Hardcore raid guilds did indeed reject certain specs. The streamers aren’t doing anything that already existed in the community. Find a more lenient raid guild if that is an issue. Blaming the streamers is ridiculous.
---
TBC introduced flying, dailies, high drop rate purples in a 5 man, while killing the old world and reducing relevant content to a handful of zones. The world felt less alive. Faction rivalry died with a shared capital and same classes.
---
That would certainly be impressive! No, testing 1-10 is pretty much the only thing I've done since I got into the beta more than a week ago. Judging by my private server experience its the first two hours where bugs and broken things demotivate you more than at any other point. There are several possible exploits (or 'griefs' rather) in the starting zones that I hope they fix before launch, because that shit will turn people off really quickly.
---
More players may not necessarily mean more money. Retail has a lot of micro transactions.
---
I assume they are collecting a lot of performance data based on the beta test. If they are showing that the game runs super smoothly without it I could see them just not doing it. That said, I was under the impression they would be implementing all of the same back-end changes to both versions of the client concurrently, so that probably means it will get all of the same optimization/system changes retail gets.
---
I'm not!
---
(Stress-test) - I get capped at 100FPS steady I guess there is an option to uncap somewhere, Ryzen7 1700/GTX 1080/16Gb Ram.
---
All the other noobs with the pumped up kicks
---
You'd better run, better run, out run my Rogue
---
You'd better run, better run, faster than my Daggers
---
Pick where you think you'll be longest imo and roll there. The beta servers are in Cali and EU players still have better latency than I did with my shitty connection back in a vanilla.
---
And people flash me side-eye when I tell them I hate streamers
---
How can I ever forget?
---
I was so scared the first time I saw that.
---
Then we wiped :)
---
You're listening to a few people yelling among a sea of casual people who don't really care.  
---
Once Classic launches you won't notice the people yelling.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I honestly feel like they should just start over with classic wow. They had almost 15 years of information with balancing, game/mechanical changes, and features. Why not just take the best of that and start over, implementing the greatest changes while avoiding the biggest downfalls from it's history?
---
And the portal
---
Idk if this is true or not but PvP horde PvE alliance hell its probably 50/50
---
It's not really any different than what was possible in Vanilla. You could query the API for stance before. There's just a more concise syntax for it now.
---
I can tell you know that I have ridiculously fast internet (not like 1TB or anything) with a persistent low 17 ping in games like Siege, but playing games like DOTA2 in EU servers I lag a bit. Enough so that I had to stop playing in the EU servers. A good way to test is to download league of legends, select your serve to be in the EU server and see how it holds up there. CTRL + F will bring up your MS and FPS so you can see.
---
Holy shit dude, thats really smart! Thanks for The advice
---
&gt;9% more parry, 2% more dodge, up to 185 more resistance.
---
9% more parry sucks for sure, but it's not the end of the world. It wont impact physical DPS directly, but it will mean a lower threat ceiling. This will likely never be an issue unless the raid is fully world buffed.
---
With bosses also hitting lower it just means tanks can get by with even less mitigation gear. It's 1% dodge, not 2%, and the 185 more resistance value has no evidence to support it other than some quote from a Blizzard employee that may just have been used to illustrate a point, or may just be referring to a handful of bosses in general. Without any more data it seem a bit dishonest to paint a picture that every boss have nearly 200 resist when this obviously wasnt the case in Vanilla, or it would have shown up on every raid video.
---
In any case, it's not 185 more than private servers, because private servers bosses are for the most part set to 75 resist. Not 0. With curse of shadow/elements the private servers bosses gets reduced down to it's 15 resist from being 3 levels above players, while Classic bosses that happen to use the resist value mentioned by Blizzard will have 115. That number is still high, but with a couple spell penetration items (That typically have around 20 spell penetration each) it can be reduced further to the point where it barely matters.
---
This will constitute a very minor loss of DPS on the few select bosses that happens to have this high resist.
---
Tanaris is such a great zone it was like a mercenary free for all out there
---
Missing things like Flying, daily quests, high drop rate purples in 5-mans, only handful of zones were relevant, etc. TBC introduced some of things that today are the most hated aspects of WoW.
---
I’ll consider this, there is an easy way to make the run now which involves dying at sea and rezzing in Dun morough
---
ya, easier to just ban the player. Better to  take care of the communication with the player via email.
---
I agree and I think this is where WoW Classic is going to run into issues. Eventually everyone who could do Naxx and AQ40 will be done with it the game will have been out for awhile and people will be done.
---
Then they have two choices. Possibly release a new legacy server for BC, upgrade Classic to BC, or try and make new content for Classic. 
---
I dont see them releasing brand new content for wow classic while also pushing a new expansion for retail wow. I just dont think they want to introduce that many developers and spread their playerbase that much. 
---
They might but I dont think they will
---
Oh no, it’s not Gearscore anymore.  It’s “IO” rating now.  A system that calculates your performance so other groups know whether you suck or not.
---
(To be clear, I vehemently despise both.)
---
sorry that was abusing rested xp, ok with retail and initial zones being super packed, I guess it might slower even for Joana. Unless the "rumours" of  lassix being easier are true then who knows...
---
&gt; They clearly have the money to just disapear for 6months.
---
not necessarily true for people besides asmon and soda
---
i guess i should have prefaced that by saying it doesnt matter in endgame since equipping t3 provides hitcap alone. its useful for t1-t2.5 progression. caster dps doesnt get that insane until bloodvine hits and t3 set bonuses are solid so thats why i kinda dismissed it
---
I'm excited for perhaps the dumbest reason ever.  
---
I reckon if I could just get the corrupted ashbringer I could somehow wander around enough to get an ashbringer.   
---
Maybe something was missed maybe on an actual server there is a way maybe if I roll need as holy pally in full redemption gear it wont even matter, I just want it.
---
Good to see people unironically bitching about a stress test. Congratulations, you're doing what the stress test is testing for, you fucking moron.
---
same scenario with me when I played on the Maelstrom realm in vanilla (RPPVP at the time)
---
In my memory, which is coming from a perspective of legit clearing Naxx in real Vanilla, warrior DPS was mediocre at best prior to AQ40 gearing. I also recall threat being a MASSIVE issue for them, with pulling aggro then dying after being soulstoned as a viable technique for farm content. This could be a result of being horde to some extent.  
---
I was a warlock at the time, and am confused by my memories every time I hear pserver community say "warlocks are amazing DPS in AQ40/Naxx". I recall them being amazing in MC (because the negative resists existed at that time), and utter dogshit DPS in AQ40/naxx. Only being brought for 2-3 curses, healthstones, summons, and Twin Emp tanking. The reason I "feel" confident about this, is because I have a very distinct memory of our TBC prepatch Patchwerk kill. Our rogue class leader said something like "Oh you think you can DPS now?" when the warlocks were near the top using the new Unstable Affliction.
---
The only hard no I will have is MT in raids in Classic is a Warrior. No Paladin MT, No Druid MT. 
---
Hybrids I’m going to be okay with In DPS rolls and Off Tank but limited. 1 Ret, 1 Feral, 1 SPriest etc. if your not THE GUY then you are healing. As far as progression raids go anyway. Stuff on farm I will be way more lacks about stuff. 
---
Is it worth hindering 39 other players just because you want to be vastly sub optimal? As long as the 39 other people don’t care I guess not. 
---
Just seems silly to me. I have mained a paladin since 05. I have tanked as a paladin since BC. I am rolling warrior because I plan on being our guild MT.
---
if I recall correctly, i believe it was a site called figureprints. pretty sure theyre still around!
---
good to know that vanilla is more flexible than folks realize, if one is willing to put in the work
---
Well when the server crashes, I'm betting the server runs like crap because of all the activity in silithus heh.
---
Why is that?
---
Nah man. There is way too many variables for eying up some one to tell you anything about them based in eye balling gear. 
---
That said, I'm fine with no xmog in classic. Honestly they only #somechanges I want are mount, and pet tabs. Getting rare mounts should be rewarding. I never carried any mount other then the single armored green raptor, and destroyed my unarmored ones back in the day. Taking up bag spots was obnoxious.
---
My question is why are you so concerned about account sharing? weve had tos violations forever whether is gold selling, account sharing etc. we never had an issue with this stuff pre Gbanks in my old guilds. GM/Officers hold each other accountable... if you cant trust them don't be in that guild.
---
The top guilds would down the bosses with min-max specs then after a couple weeks farm the raid with sub-obtimal groups.  
---
Casual guilds had trouble getting 40 mans together for 4-5 hours, in PVE gear with potions. We made it work and it was fun.  
---
Either way you will be able to play your characters the way you want.
---
How did you not see the green hair?
---
Why the fuck? Nobody will play that once Classic is out.
---
I’m going out of my comfort zone for classic I never played casters so when classic rolls out I’ll be rolling mage/warlock/priest
---
"After some testing on a Servant mob in the Blasted Lands, I have a more accurate idea of the proc rate. All testing was done on the same level 53 "Servant of Grol" wielding Ironfoe along with a shield. All attacks were either auto-attacks, Bloodthirst or Revenge (all of which I believe are capable of triggering Chance on Hit effects). I used no other equipment that granted extra attacks, although I did have Crusader enchanted and enough Heroism equipped for the "chance on hit to heal" set bonus.
---
In all I attacked the mob 3,226 times with Ironfoe, and recieved 87 extra attack procs (counting the combatlog message "You gain 2 extra attacks from Fury of Forgewright." as a single proc). 42 of those attacks were partially blocked (but still did damage), 62 were dodged, 32 were parried, and none missed.
---
This would make the proc rate 2.70%, or 0.675 procs per minute. For comparison, Crusader is believed to be approximately 1 proc per minute (I found 1.07 procs per minute in my testing). It should be noted that "procs per minute" refers to how often it would be expected that a Chance on Hit activates for a character simply auto-attacking without using any special abilities, or attack speed increases - in practice the proc rate will be higher.
---
So basically, the weapon seems to have approximately a 2.70% chance on each attack to cause you to gain two further attacks.
---
[This test was performed on the live WoW servers, under version 1.11.2"](http://web.archive.org/web/20070821131917/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=11684)
---
I ain't saying it's garbage. It was certainly used as a *good* weapon, even if it wasn't the best one. But people weren't running around wearing Ironfoes in BWL like they were going out of style. It wasn't BiS for Prot Warriors. It wasn't BiS for most Rogue specs. Fury Warriors barely existed at the time. iirc, there was a time in early Vanilla where its proc rate was actually really high, and it also had three extra attacks pre 1.2, but these things were nerfed well before 1.12, which is the patch we'll be on.
---
[Also, 2%, not .2%.](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11684) I believe the droprate was buffed throughout Vanilla, so old databases showed it at around 0.5% in the aggregate? Anyway, it's rare at any length.
---
Will this hurt warlocks because of their high threat generation?  I was hoping to roll one
---
If it's anything like retail there is an option somewhere in advanced settings that caps it at 100. Uncheck that. Otherwise not sure.
---
I know. I wrote this coming from a pserver perspective where I used all these stance dance macros. I shouldve mentioned that probably.
---
But Blizzard broke braindead macros like Decursive before, so I'd hope they do it again for such macros. Just my personal opinion.
---
&gt;And fwiw tanking 6 mobs in SFK wasn't that hard for a decently geared tank.  The hard part was holding threat on 6 mobs when thunderclap was capped at 4 mobs.
---
The actual problem would be using thunderclap for tanking.
---
&gt; the game should run flawlessly on even very old computers.
---
You should just stop spreading  this disinformation.  There will be plenty of people whose computer could run the vanilla client but cannot run the Classic client.    
---
I am on a 2017 laptop and the Classic client on higher graphics settings is quite demanding.  This  is with 8 GB ram and an i5.   
---
Of course it runs better than current BFA WoW.   
---
The rest of your comment is correct and helpful.  Just not the last sentence.
---
This always strikes me. People say retail sucks. Flying, dailies, high drop rate purples in 5 mans, only relevant content in a handful of zones, etc. All of these came from TBC....
---
can confirm this from my mage
---
the tooltip doesnt change though
---
I remember getting parry haste bombed as late as ice dragon boss in ICC on my pally. Had to get so much expertise and junk just to make dmg more consistent. I don't remember any bosses in cata doing that, off the top of my head. Did ruby dragonshrine parry haste? Might have been the last one?
---
As an avid forsaken fan and beta tester, it is indeed the first track. It is glorious.
---
That's a sight to behold.
---
Clear casting should proc on AoE cast and not on units hit.
---
If you AoE 10 mobs you should not have a near 100% chance to proc Clearcast. You can see this in Faxmonkey's video during the invasion event mobs. He AoEs like 50 at a time and doesn't proc more than a few times.
---
https://youtu.be/3O_pNDc73MM
---
13:45
---
It actually procs once.
---
There was never any uncertainty about this on private servers. Bad mages just defended it because ZG crocs, AOE leveling. Etc, actually became impossible for them without the infinite mana back when many private servers determined it by damage. Good mages always wanted it removed because it made some ridiculous farms possible and destroyed the economy. I.e. a good, geared mage could do triple croc pulls in ZG without dying, but with bugged Clearcast, any mage could do it, greatly screwing the cost of coins and bijous for the good mages
---
Many private servers still give Arcane Missiles a proc dip per missile (41% per cast)  rather than 1 on successfully reaching the cast point of the first missile. (Vanilla)
---
A lot of people immediately start seizing up when 2h’s drop in raid. News flash, the classes that can use them don’t need them. Hunters with bone hatchet do more damage than with the best 2h out of the first two raids. Warriors do more damage with 1h’s. I play Alliance so that leaves Paladin/Druid which to be frank if they are healing there are 2 if I recall that have +INT on them. (I think there may have been a 3rd but 2 for sure). Druid doesn’t benefit from weapon dps, they are just stat sticks. 
---
So who gets them? Did you bring a Ret? A PvP warrior?  Not a whole lot of options. 
---
This will be an issue with Raid leaders/Council - if you are a PvE strictly guild then the 2h’s are for the meme specs and off specs. No main specs that are optimal use them for their dps. 
---
As a raid leader you’ll have to really do your homework this time because there’s tons more information and you can find a lot of that with just research. 
---
Being a raid leader wasn’t about talking about the pulls or coming up with Strategies, it was about people. Having at least 40 people WANT to show up and waste a night while you talk non-stop. It’s not like it is now. Gearing up your raiders takes time. What you do as a raid lead can spell the death of your guild and we haven’t even spoke about what happens at Naxx 4 horseman if you get there.
---
All there damage is dispellable, they dont have on demand  damage for killing efcs like lock mage or shaman, and they just take up a valuable spot for one of those or a healer
---
That bit from the video doesn't really disprove anything I'm claiming. My point was that Blizzard would have retained backups of Vanilla which OP didn't seem to think they would have.
---
What's stopping you from doing it?
---
Black Fathom Deeps and NE was cool!
---
You have gone full retard.
---
At no point have I said that giving out .25% crit was a "plan", just that it was an alternative solution to ratings, and explicitly stated that this was one of a handful of alternatives I came up with in under 120 seconds that avoid the problems of characters decreasing in strength, and old gear remaining BiS.
---
You seem to also still be completely ignoring the issue being discussed here, which is: Ratings reduce in effectiveness as you levelup, which makes your character weaker by increasing in level. That's a pretty big fucking problem in a game based almost entirely around building up your characters strengths.
---
Please refrain from future retardation.
---
It's not super common but yes it does happen. Mainly warriors and druids that really like that class that like raiding but also want to do other things. For many people the 6 days to level to 60 is much easier the never ending 50g repsecs or playing some bastard spec.
---
Or just play a warrior or rogue and do better damage and be a more reliable tank for fractions of the effort and let druids exercise their comparative advantage...healing. 
---
The super hardcore will of course farm the mcps needed. But its the casual/semi casual player. The people who make the forum posts "Can I play a feral in Classic!?" then are appalled when they learn in a subsequent thread that MCP has 3 charges. Ever. 
---
Ive seen plenty of people who once they learn that lose all interest in playing feral druid. Who knows how many dont know that and are fooled into thinking playing feral isnt that much more effort. But it is. 
---
Ferals have to do everything rogues/warriors have to do to prep for raid...and farm MCPs. 
---
Im happy barely viable specs can work if the player puts in the above average effort. But its super disingenuous for the uber pserver nerds who make these guides to be putting in BOEs in the prebis or suggesting that playing ele/ret/spriest/feral/enh isnt significantly more work to do less damage than any of the "pure" dps and that "casual" guilds will be more welcoming to these specs. They wont. 
---
Playing a meme spec in raids means you put in the work to farm MCP. No one in a casual guild is doing that. Its not casual behavior. Brining in a bunch of meme specs who did no out of raid prep is asking to fail.
---
Those are some good points! Makes it sounds like a lot of fun actually :)
---
To be fair, 99% of people roll female with NE anyway, why waste the development time, right?
---
When you see something shiny on the ground but it is just a rock... and a dime falls from your pocket.
---
Well met
---
I remember doing Sunken Temple, Stratholme, LBRS and BRD as Shadow - all fully doable but not easy.
---
Ya that’s not gonna happen. They may not love it and could re roll.
---
There are also orc skeletons on the ground if you look closely
---
In BG's horde has small advantage in WSG, and ally has big advantage in AB. So overall ally is better in premading at least until AQ comes around and shamans becomes unstoppable killing machines. 
---
Horde has better racials but paladin is better than shaman.
---
Dominance? Horde is usually the zerg faction with more players but weaker, they win because of numbers so as soon as you go into BG's they typically win pugs but lose premades. Big reason why they win pugs is because lots of horde pvp in small groups rather than just solo queue. Ally dominates in premade pvp so all the good pvpers are doing that instead of queue solo, and ally is left with a bunch of retards in solo games.
---
That's my experience though.
---
Humans doing Karate
---
Night Elves doing Thai Kickboxing
---
Dwarves are trying not to fall over while drunk
---
Gnomes just got around to watching The Matrix
---
Orcs are Spartans and they don't like messengers
---
Trolls are Taekwando masters
---
Undead are a little rusty, but still remember some of their Karate
---
I don't see any Tauren here because you are obviously racist, or Blizzard is for not giving them kicks even though they can't be rogues. Probably both.
---
Go with honor, friend.
---
&gt;that the game was not ready for mass consumption
---
Did you expect something different from a beta?
---
Pizza rolls are a safe and acceptable alternative
---
well, I guess premades are always going to have the edge on PUGs.
---
thanks you for your reply.
---
Must be... Karma
---
BC was the best just because of the balance it brought to the game, vanilla is great but BC is king.
---
Flashbacks, PTSD.
---
what do you mean? that alliance do better in PVE and horde in PVP?
---
I don't know. I recently came back after a 12 year absence and the crazy mounts and transmogs are up there on my list of annoyances. Transmog is one of those things that seem harmless but have a profound effect on immersion.
---
it doesn't. one is filled with solid blocks and one is filled with photo-realistic chunks.
---
&gt;OSRS has 3x as many players as RS3
---
It's just not comparable mate.
---
I only defend vanilla when people want it changed for this project. I welcome all who want to experience something that they haven’t.
---
Im gonna kill a few extra boars, just for you.
---
Never had this happen once ... I mean maybe it did and I didnt notice... nooo cant be.
---
I liked WC. The atmosphere was good, I also played NE, so some related lore.
---
Could train swords on my rogue before 10. Tested today.
---
Deadlines is really more like 18+ since Van Cleef is lvl 21.
---
That was pretty good
---
Earthbind totem slows everything in an AoE. Their shock spells are like a 5 second cooldown
---
This is almost certainly a bug, it seems as if more things are being affected by spell batching than intentional - some things should always be mutually exclusive. I recall in Vanilla that the flag had slight lag to it, probably to compensate for batching and to figure out who should be awarded the click to prevent this from happening.
---
It's discovery all the way down.
---
&gt;Making you sub full price for retail in order to play Classic seems somewhat passive aggressive. OSRS has 3x as many players as RS3,
---
Runescape and Everquest do the same thing, I don't understand how thats passive aggressive.
---
&gt; do you think Blizzard might consider making content specifically for classic
---
I'd imagine they'd just release legacy servers for future expansions.
---
Lmfaoooo this makes me OK with all you whiney asses dropping off as all the real ogs stay neck deep in classic. Enjoy your phones and fortnites young scumbags *wags cane*
---
I definitely see where it can lead. I agree with you and blizzard has their phillosphy on what they're going to do with classic and thats fine. Again like I said though with nobody bitching about other peoples post about this exact change I figured I'd throw it out there to be discussed. Not many people have came back with logical arguements other than RAWR NO CHANGES!!!! But hey.. Whatever. Whats a few karma points down the drain from a reddit post? :D 
---
In my opinion though people didn't figure out the guild bank solution on private servers. People on private servers just don't give a shit about account sharing lol. They make another account with a guild bank on it and give all the information to the officers.
---
Me and my friend Alpines (the Druid) leveled together in this and the previous stress tests and he gave me two extra bags he came across. I was definitely hurting for bag space but we got lucky!
---
&gt;With bosses also hitting lower it just means tanks can get by with even less mitigation gear.
---
but the parry means more parryhasting which means tanks will take more damage. And there's still no evidence that bosses are hitting harder on nostcore servers across the board. 
---
&gt;It's 1% dodge, not 2%
---
1.5% which gets rounded up to 2% in vanilla (thats how it works on private at least)
---
&gt;Without any more data it seem a bit dishonest to paint a picture that every boss have nearly 200 
---
i did say "up to". either way it's almost certainly gonna be higher on average
---
&gt;because private servers bosses are for the most part set to 75 resist. Not 0.
---
if i was mistaken here then my bad, but i said +15 on private servers, which was quoted from staysafe after he had been to irvine and heard about the up to 200 resist in vanilla. got sources that it's 75 and not 15?
---
also, you edited in that private servers have 4700 standardized armor, which is true (actually i believe they also used 3700 for some bosses), and that meaxna had 3700 and kel thuzad 3000 on retail, also true. But blizzard also said in the irvine inteerview that armor was not standardized but rather set to a number that fit thematically. So bosses like golemagg, garr, ragnaros, etc, will likely have way higher armor. 
---
Also another point worth mentioning is that scripting will actually function correctly on classic, there's been plenty of issues with private servers where bosses aren't behaving correctly and using abilities as they should, which could really either be a buff or nerf depending on how it manifests.
---
edit: saw your edit on the resist values being 75 and reduced to 15 by curse, so ill take your word on it and i stand corrected there.
---
I'm going right back to what I did back in the day. My gear I wear out to quest and the set I keep in my bank for when I sit around in town.
---
Generally yes
---
It makes me question my life choices when I instantly knew what that talent was from the image and I never really played a rogue. Ahh WoW.
---
Loot council is prone to corruption. Cliques and favoritism forms among some members who will win over other equally deserving members.
---
I prefer some form of dkp system. That way everyone knows how much everyone has. Someone that contributes a lot, but doesn't spend a lot could afford an item they really wanted, instead of loot council awarding it to someone just because.
---
It may very well be brought in for this specific event, as it will draw thousands of players to one area in wow and it killed servers back in the day.
---
The AQ event was a purebred lag machine lol and layering was created to combat this specific lag machine issue.
---
Neither. IDK how it could keep the level 20 limit on polearms but drop the limit for everything else. I'll make a rogue tonight and see if swords/maces are locked at level 10 for them. Warriors, unsure of paladins, could learn any of their skills from level 1 from what I remember.
---
Edit: nvm, was maybe thinking of dual wield. IDK if there were any limits to weapon skills other than polearms.
---
Typical PServer player. Think their Pserver is accurate and get butthurt when told otherwise.
---
This great. Thank you!
---
Ya we started with Priest as the idea but I think she likes Pally more. It’s a bummer that there is t a good way for her to see what it looks like first. The videos out there aren’t great.
---
Are you thinking of Dual Wield by chance? You have to be level 10 as a Rogue to learn it from your Class Trainer; other classes need to wait until 20 for that.
---
Not to mention expansion packs.
---
There was both, servers crashed due to overpopulation, and players had fps issues because their computers were too bad to display so many people
---
It’s like you want classic to have to shitty launch. Why? Why do you want realm crashes and log in ques?
---
yeah maybe.
---
8 Days is pretty easy to hit if you avoid farming dungeons and wpvp.
---
I know everyone has their own path to follow, but I can't imagine skipping those first dungeons and wpvp fights just to get a slightly better /played at 60. 10 days /played should be pretty good for someone not ignoring everything else.
---
You can tell more by how much HP they have. I would certainly agree on weapons xmogs being turned off in bfa. (I also don't care about classic excluding xmog at all. It didn't exist)
---
But,. You can have the best lvl 49 gear as the enchanted myrhril set and it visually identical to lvl 20 white vender mail.
---
A warrior with stockade pauldrons could have all t3 under his tabard and cloak and you'd probably have no idea.
---
&gt; Nah man. There is way too many variables for eying up some one to tell you anything about them based in eye balling gear.
---
Not really. It's fine if you can't tell what someone is doing in Vanilla from gear, but a lot of PvPers could, which is why I brought it up. Gear was very distinctive in Vanilla and there wasn't anywhere near as much of it as there is now in retail. Obviously you don't have access to someone's armory just from looking at their visual gear, but you can easily surmise their set bonuses and to a lesser degree if they are using heavy stam sets or not and adjust target priority based on that.
---
It's completely okay to disagree with the point itself, but you asked for an explanation and I am giving it to you. It's one of the main arguments from anti-transmoggers, mainly PvPers.
---
I'm glad you liked it :)
---
I distinctly remember having to do this once in Vanilla, and as soon as somebody in my party explained it clearly, I was able to do it easily.
---
Plus I thought you were just talking shit about Frost Shock lol
---
I see it no differently than when they make a new game. Which they do all the time
---
Not for the soul shard, but it does for the regen buff.
---
How dare they have fun and take their time! 
---
As someone who also plays OSRS this elitist attitude is nothing new to see and generally has no real impact on the larger community since these players isolate themselves to their small group of super efficient players who arent to good at being inculsive to welcome newer players into thier circle.
---
Classic or any expansion, doesn't matter. If a character didn't clear it, it shouldn't benefit from it.
---
Polearms is the only weapon skill with a level requirement. 
---
Shamans can’t learn 2h until talented. rogue, warrior, and hunters get DW at 10 and 20.
---
Thanks for these mate. Can you tell me, at level 10 will I have to go back to my races starting zone for my class quest?
---
Chef? You still have eyebrows.
---
There’s a weekly thread for posts like these. You can find the link in the sidebar. Please keep them there.
---
Start NA and then if you move and it’s unplayable you could always reroll.
---
0/10
---
It took us a really long time to do. I talked to my group and most everyone said they have been playing since around 2005ish. Personally, myself and the Druid Alpines raid on retail together and have gotten Mythic Jaina to 26% but no kill yet if that’s any indication of skill level lol. We kited this boss like crazy. He would actually almost one shot me as the tank if I got too close.
---
Quality stuff.
---
I disagree. For context, my guild had 4H on farm in Vanilla.
---
Most raids in Vanilla required 15-25 people to actually know what they were doing, and the rest were essentially bodies to fill space. Plenty of players had full T2 without being any kind of top player, especially in guilds that used DKP and where gear was mostly attendance/tenure based.
---
This is a big reason why the 25-player raid cap in TBC was a good thing, as it allowed guilds to “trim the fat” so to speak.
---
In BFA, the dragon would be non-elite and scaled down to his level.
---
&gt; horde has small advantage in WSG, and ally has big advantage in AB 
---
Was never that much into PVP in Vanilla, what are the advantages/disadvantages of each faction in BG's exactly?
---
the peak of right-wing comedy are the same endless gender jokes, apparently
---
I was really confused for a moment because I didn’t understand what I said that made you think I don’t know what the difference between Layering and Sharding is. 
---
I see now (at least I think?) what you mean initially is sort of “sharding” with the pool of players that could be included being from any layer of that specific server. 
---
I’m not sure if that’s any better than sharding as it is in retail as you still still end up with less of a consistent world because players just stop existing when you cross boundaries. In essence you would get the benefit of always knowing the people you see are from your server, but still get the other drawbacks. Am I interpreting your initial comment right?
---
That is fair.  
---
I wasn't really trying to give a pass, it probably did come off that way. I was mostly just trying to note where that type of mentality might have stemmed from. I know that I personally, having extensively played EQ1 and WoW from launch, had this type of mentality.  
---
I actually rolled a rogue in WoW thinking to myself, "Oh man these guys are gonna be sick but nobody will want to play them because they are giant trashcans solo". This was clearly me projecting the state of EQ1 balance into WoW.
---
Indeed :)
---
Items/abilities constantly changed throughout mc/bwl and beyond. You have no clue what you're talking about, and it clearly shows.
---
Propose a better solution to the problem or STFU. All you've done is complain and not offer any alternatives.
---
I levelled two chars to 10 last night and I've done two others to level 5. Two bags total.
---
Cringy lies
---
I have a right to see what your character looks like so I can make an evaluation of what I'm fighting against in PvP. There are other good arguments, but this one just trumps anything you can bring. PvP mandates that other players have a chance to see what gear you are wearing.
---
I also don't care what "we" used to do in EQ or whatever. This is not EQ.
---
Private servers baby
---
Horde have had nearly every major World First in PVE.
---
Layering is only phase 1, so lets add gbank but only for like, 3 weeks.
---
On the other hand if you really make the cost 50.000gold guilds will reconsider and possibly do not even use it, because these tens of thousands of gold could go to consumables used for the maintank and healers to further progression.
---
Well organized guilds will not need guild banks, because you will have predetermined windows of bank accesibility like after a raidnight to gain access to dropped BoE gear.
---
And casual guilds will probably not be willing to foot the bill for such a major investment.
---
Ally has a huge advantage in AV*, not AB. You can circumvent the bridge chokepoint with backdoor walljumping, but that's not feasible in pugs, so Alliance always had a huge advantage throughout Vanilla on that map.
---
Another fantastic suggestion.
---
Although child upkeep during off-hours may cut into OP’s personal WoW time.
---
classic was great, it took ages to reach lvl60 and walking thousands of miles arpund the 2 continents.
---
now you get to lvl60 in no time and you miss the questing part that made the game epic.
---
If you're good, you'll get a raid spot regardless of your class (not necessarily spec). Dont stress about it. Just pick what sounds fun and play.
---
Yeah I think I was thinking of Dual Wield that someone else pointed out to me.
---
This isn't possibly answerable. It's contingent entirely on the playerbase of your server, both in terms of individual skill, PvP guild organization, and faction balance.
---
Good thing you're not going to get to those 3 hour raids in the first month!
---
I even told them in the email I'd provide an ID and ik my character names and my 2 hunter pet names as well... :/
---
See, you’re actually wrong here. The boss auto attacks hard, sure, but if you get too close he does an uppercut that knocks you into the air so you can’t move, and a fire nova AoE that hits everyone for about 90 damage. We all had around 200HP so anything hitting us more than once was a wipe. 
---
Also, I’m on Mythic Jaina on retail so that LFR card doesn’t work
---
Organized group vs group - alliance is better  
---
A bunch of individuals vs individuals - horde is better
---
horde is better at random pvp and bgs (when its a bunch of individuals), and alliance is better in group pvp and premades (group bgs). 
---
hpaladins are just too op in groups. 
---
warriors raping eveyone on freedoms, bubbles have no counter play in vanilla, every alliance player got 10% more hp cos of blessing of kings buff. 
---
fair pvp right? when every player of one faction got 10% more health and therefore survivability to its counterpart (except for taurens). and horde cant do anything to counter it it. thats just the reality of vanilla pvp you need to deal with.
---
also just sheer amount buffs hanging on alliance side players makes it very hard to dispel and purge anything.
---
~
---
So ya if you plan to play solo pvp, queue random bgs alone and such - play horde, if you aim to be in a premade, join a pvp guild, play in organzied pvp etc. - go alliance. (obviously you can go either side for anything, just saying which got the edge for that type of activity, its not like you cant be in a premade as horde and do well as a group. you can ofc).
---
also something to consider that alliance usually got faster queues for bgs, because more horde players do pvp. Cos just as a faction overall alliance have more casuals on average, though stronger group pvp as i said.
---
If you tryhard and minmax you can find a guild easily. The problem is how good of a guild, it's really hard to say but you should be fine. 
---
Yes you should be fine. Mage can be hard if you let him get close enough to do exactly that, blink into deadzone. so you gotta keep that in mind.
---
/u/comfyfutons 2020
---
You can say I have mixed motives.
---
On one side of things, I don't give a shit if people actually account share. I wont do it, my guild can suck it up. What I care about is the amount of time that blizzard support needs to put forth into policing this or fixing things that happen due to account sharing. Its costs they can cut / focus else where. This isn't an issue with retail right now, but I'm guessing a lot more authenticators will be removed from accounts and a lot more "hackings" will happen over the course of classic's life. 
---
On the other side of things, since I am leading a guild and I have RL obligations like a wife, a kid, and another kid on the way that I just can't drop on a whim to log on and get someone something out of the gbank. Id like to have my officers have access to that while im not online. They're going to have to suck it up like I said if there aren't gbanks, but it would be a convenience thing I'm not opposed to. So... mixed motives here.
---
Twink life
---
No, we don't want Alliance scum. He is lost to us now. We will kill him and his King in retaliation. We must send a message to others like him, no one betrays the Horde and lives.
---
I'm flattered that you think this is the peak, but I'm puzzled that you think only right wingers find the 25-different-genders thing ridiculous. 
---
I vote Green in Germany, which is like left of AOC in American terms.
---
I've been mulling over loot distribution systems myself trying to figure out what would be ideal, because I'm super picky on that front. Even if I were the one calling the shots, I wouldn't want to do a loot council system; it's *way* too easy to breed contempt even if the people calling the shots *aren't* corrupt, and calling it the best loot system is like calling a dictatorship the best form of government. 
---
I've ultimately been leaning towards a zero-sum DKP system with a few little tweaks. One of the big strengths of zero-sum is that it's really easy for people to understand: "Player A has the most points so he wins Item B, Item B has a value of C so Player A loses that many points and everyone in the raid earns 1/40th of that much for helping to get it for him." Bidding and silent bidding have players effectively *gambling* for loot in the middle of a raid, so static values seem better. You then have to put a price on every item, but you can start with a simple vendor-price-based formula for everything and adjust things later based on feedback if you keep a properly formatted spreadsheet for stuff.
---
As for the tweaks I mentioned, you'd first want to address point hoarding; you don't want people trying to pass on an upgrade because they're saving their points to beat everyone on something big. A soft solution is to institute a weekly point decay of like 10%, so you're strongly encouraged to spend your points while you have them so you lose less (and it's also an encouragement for attendance). A more direct solution is to just forbid people from passing on upgrades, where if *nobody* wants it then the people who *could* benefit from it have to roll for who has to spend points on it.
---
I also don't like that a lot of loot systems are mercilessly progression focused, where the only way a healer or tank or something can get gear they might want for PvP/dungeons/solo is for *everyone* else to pass on it. People doing their raid role *is* obviously important, but if the people have been showing up for raids and putting the work in, they've earned what they can get. I'd probably just treat someone as having 1/2 as many points for something they wouldn't use in their raid role, that seems like a simple enough fix that wouldn't cause too much strife.
---
Eh, this only happened to me once or twice out of the dozens of times I ran ZF.  So the "classic experience" is that this doesn't happen the majority of the time.  No individual would ever notice if they fixed it.
---
Similarly for things like a boss dying too close to a wall and being unable to loot it.  We did several raids every week for years, and this happened to us once or twice total.
---
just delete this stupid thread already
---
Can you share a link showing alliance and horde side by side. Not saying I don’t believe you I have always felt horde is better pvp than pve and vis versa
---
You must have played private servers only because that is simply not true. You might be thinking about getting duel wield at 10 but you could always train other weapons right away.
---
I remember using my hunter’s ability to see through her pet’s eyes (forget what this was called) to get 60 second snippets of “Old Ironforge”. I also had a stranger show me how to get to the Ironforge Airport with the gnomes and little planes.  Me and that stranger explored for a few hours before he jumped into a void.  Such great times.
---
&gt; Also having shoulders and a headpiece useable at level 1 is kind of nice. It always weirded me out that WoW thinks basic pieces of your armor set shouldn't be available until 20-40 levels into the game.
---
It's sort of silly, but not from a gameplay perspective. It's fun and feels like an accomplishment when you get your first pieces in certain slots. Starting off with amazing gear in all your key slots isn't very rewarding.
---
Well I purchased games I no longer can play. I had the card game turtle mount and hippogriph I dont think u can even get anymore. And I'd like to match my old character looks to my new classic guys. :/
---
If this is a joke then its awesome. If this is a serious suggestion please unsub.
---
I think each side had fair facials for PvP, though there were some better combos on the horde side.
---
Undead rogue is my favorite with WotF. Back in vanilla, WotF acted like beserker rage for warriors, “removes and prevents for 2s.” I remember gutting warlocks and priests and pre-emptively popping WotF and watching their fear go off or psychic scream and nothing happening. Ultimate shut down. 
---
Orc warriors (with the right talents) get 40% chance to resist stuns. Umm, bye rogues. 
---
Humans perception iirc, acted like an anti-stealth. Useful, but highly situational. (I’m not sure every man for himself was vanilla)
---
Gnome escape artist was an active snare break (again, iirc). Really only useful for melee as casters have different kiting tools. 
---
NElf shadowmeld was really strong in WSG and AB, outside of ganking though, not much usefulness there. 
---
(Didn’t play dwarf. But stoneform only really useful to counter rogues poisons/bleeds. Note on dwarf priest fear ward class racial)
---
Orc is a great pick for PvE and PvP with hardiness and bloodfury. There always were a bunch of orcs, whether it was war lock or rogue. Didn’t see too many shaman in PvP. 
---
Tauren are the horde minority by far. Good for PvE tanks. There are much stronger active racials available to the horde to resort picking Tauren for PvP.
---
That's completely besides the point. I don't care about AV it's shit bg you only do for one weekend a month. Alliance has a huge advantage in AB because of paladins and teamfighting with them.
---
one char no twink no bank char. some people asked this question already and the answer in the past was its not worth it to level 6 weeks a farming char.
---
the other thing is the fantasy people remeber names. but not names of twinks.
---
Sick burn
---
Where did you get that mousepad at????
---
I guess you're right. More for us to slaughter!
---
So that's a bloodelf. Does your post relate to ClassicWoW, or is it just a nostalgia post that's from the TBC era? It's literally the first rule of the sub reddit
---
I think it’s a little extreme to think Classic will concurrently surpass the live game, with its constant updates and new content. However, I think it’s likely that Classic traffic will surpass live traffic *for a moment*. Only when retail activity is down massively, and when Classic is doing well, say, BWL patch and the content drought before the next expansion. That could be a very real possibility for Classic to surpass live, if only temporarily.
---
He's not wrong
---
You should play Hunter
---
did a rogue pickpocket u?
---
Not BIS, but it's one of the only trinkets you'll have for a long time.
---
Like he said OSRS is crazy popular and people spend thousands of hours clicking in the same spot training one skill. I'm sure the grind of classic wow will not be a big turn off.
---
Armor values are now lower resulting in huge dps gains for melee from that perspective. They will remain kings especially later raids.
---
You don't like reality much do you?
---
Because a raid that takes an hour doing things 'proper' (closer to 30m if tryhard) will now take 3+ hours of your time
---
One of my favourite tropes in any action film.
---
How is this going to change any metas? Everyone benefits from this - all it does is effectively remove latency as a factor of your ability casts. It benefits you whether you are a caster or a melee class.
---
You can hit rend and queue up a thunderclap after, or you can queue up a fire blast after your fireball. I'm not sure how that's going to change anything really. 
---
Even if you removed spell queueing all you're going to do then is bring it back to whoever has the lower latency has an advantage again - it's not as if everyone with low latency only played mages in vanilla or something.
---
You deleted this before I can tell you how dumb it was

The BBQ-bit didn't tip you off?

NA [PVP] [horde] [H] [Butterz Colony]

LOOKING FOR SERIOUS PLAYERS FIRST and CASUAL PLAYERS SECOND
---
Hello, my excited people. I am a professional chef turned full time streamer. We are trying to expand our growing guild for classic wow release. If you are interested in a dedicated guild and want to have your part in the makings of something amazing Hit me up ! You can do that through our discord and the stream which I will have linked down below. I will be playing a prot warrior I will also be racing to be one of the first 60 warriors as i said I can play full time so I have the time and dedication to make this guild great. LETS DO THIS COME JOIN THE COMMUNITY WE NEED YOU!
---
As far as the discord come in say Hi and what you plan on playing in the Classic wow channel. Just brought up that channel so come say hi and lets get it popping!
---
https://www.twitch.tv/chefbutterz
---
https://discord.gg/MaukaY
---
So in other words, the issue is vertical progression and how current retail WoW renders 90% of content as irrelevant and something to simply get out of the way. Heirlooms sound like a bandaid solution for bad game design.
---
lol at least /kiss them before you slaughter them. :)
---
Ohh, i get it. You want to lead a vanilla guild, but do no work that a vanilla gm does.
---
Well I am confuse
---
I wouldn't let it affect your decision in the slightest. While warlocks do have threat issues they also bring some nasty dps eventually. It's not like you nuke the mob once and you just pull and die. It's more like when you're all buffed up and going all out you might have to pause depending if your tank has thunderfury and what buffs they have.
---
Definitely still roll one if that's the class you enjoy.
---
Still happens in retail.
---
https://www.method.gg/raid-history
---
That’s not really unlucky, drop rates are way lower in Classic
---
probably not. and you won't get a stable population until weeks or months into the server's lifetime anyway. it will likely be monitored through 3rd party sites
---
At level 30, there is no need to be deep prot. Thunderclap isnt usable in defensive stance I believe?
---
TIPSOUT IS TRASH AND HE CALLS HIMSELF A PVPER
---
I think the ultimate BM is /cry on their corpse before they release.
---
Agreed. Honestly I could see myself playing retail, the raids are good and the pvp is probably fine aswell. The overall problem with retail is just that it doesn't feel that rewarding and it's very anti-social.
---
I definitely was leaning more on it being a joke... But its 2019 and you never know lol. I cant keep up with all the abbreviations xd
---
A year? Hardly.
---
He literally announced classic in front of blizzcon audience with words "turns out you do want that". Stop being moron. Your hate boner is childish.   
---
I regret coming to this sub, this community is toxic as shit full of gatekeepers. Half the sub is bitching about people who didn't play the game, other about streamers who have access.
---
You mean Undead Male?
---
Not sure where you got that quote lol. Definiely not in on hype. Hate retail, havent played seriously since Wrath. Played on multiple private servers, but private servers didn't have to address this issue since you could just make a totally separate account and have it as a guild bank account lol.
---
It's not "misinformation". "Very old" is not a standardized precise term. :)
---
Anything which supports DirectX 11 should run Classic nicely. Obviously not on highest settings but I wasn't saying that.
---
And I know that not every computer which can run Vanilla can run Classic as I said in my post a little earlier. However anything which *can* run Classic, will more then likely run Classic *better* than Vanilla. (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4)
---
if you want to raid its the worse class to pick.
---
its one of the most popular classes to play and raids only take about 3 hunters
---
Gbanks would affect the server for 100% of its lifetime.
---
They are low level, what specc they have for 5man wont matter, they can still tank.  
---
Thunderclap is not a tank ability in vanilla, sunder and tab is how warrior aoe tanks.
---
Super excited to farm dungeons with friends and randoms. For bis, for gold and just for fun.
---
Gold farming will basically be an endless chore. There are so many gold syncs early on and so much to buy
---
It's their raid and it's a real thing in vanilla... you can choose to be viable or not.
---
Yea also didn't even think about this before but if its really expensive like that then it makes the guild, not the people in the guild, but the guild super valuable so you get a big market for selling guilds because they have tabs...
---
This is a much larger change that people believe and solidly in the territory of minor steps that led to classic wow even being asked for in the first place. Let's not go backward guys.
---
You mean the shit that never actually made it in game but then they gave it to Worgens haha.
---
I would open more servers and merge them as the population dies, just as it was done in WoW Classic.
---
LOL through the fires of hell I have climbed.
---
Entering Ragefire Chasm at lvl 10? That's hardcore, man. Respect.
---
The one where I tanked a 2 headed dragon/dinosaur thing at the end and got a samurai sword. Unless I imagined it?
---
But the player cleared it...and the player could clear it on any character with enough gear...idk man, I think you're just not connecting some dots.
---
Wait until your buddies wanna roll alliance and you’re a diehard horde guy. My struggle is real &gt;.&lt;
---
Hmmmm. Not sure where you got that from at all lol. Guild bank management is a small portion of what I'll have to do. Just saying it would be a convenience. You guys are funny.

---
Oh, I do, there is a reason they became just a group of friends, and not my group of friends.
---
&gt; Not really.
---
Yes really. You can't tell if someone has 8/8 tier1 at a glance. Even verifying 5/8 is hard. Being that anal about it might work if you have a lot of time in stealth and even then you'd only be sure about 5/8, no other class will try to check if a someone has a certain belt, bracers, shoes, etc.
---
Yes also as a pvper I hate pve gear and traits in pvp, it's so fucking dumb. Mop and wod had the best pvp gearing with pvp vendors and pve gear didn't work in pvp.
---
There was Ony/MC/ZG/BWL/AQ20/AQ40/Naxx (correct me if there were more). That's 7 end game raids. I completed 5.5/7 or ~80% having absolutely no clue what I was doing. 
---
That doesn't account for all the other content in the game.
---
The vast vast majority of vanilla was simple.
---
They will even if they don't want to, fans are gonna light a fire under their asses otherwise.
---
For tanking while leveling, you won't need to have the later protection talents to be able to tank the dungeons. It's about striking a balance between being able to tank comfortably and being able to kill stuff relatively quickly while leveling solo.
---
Tabbing and sundering is far better threat wise than stancing to battlestance and thunderclapping.
---
I've developed a scientific method over the last 15 years as to determine which faction on your server is blessed with more talented and generally better PVPers. It's a rather sophisticated formula, but I try to break it down for the layman with a flowchart:
---
Are you Horde?
---
||
---
You only have drooling troglodytes in your faction and somehow Alliance picked up all the good PVPers. It sucks, but that's what it is.
---
You only have drooling troglodytes in your faction and somehow Horde picked up all the good PVPers. It sucks, but that's what it is.
---
They also have an additional 13 years worth of art assets to draw from when adding new (or retooled) content.
---
Path of Exile for example does a masterful job of mixing and matching assets and tilesets to create new zones with a lot less work.
---
Thinking about it now, the "starter" area, the single players jungle, that "elite" side area, the town, that first two dungeons and that island you travel to were really complex for a "starter" area.
---
I can barely remember any other part of the game, but I do remember those sections vividly, and my failure of an attemt to make a dark templar do any damage.
---
Why do you care enough to make a post about it?
---
I think all reasons for being upset lead to FOMO
---
Well I be damned thanks for the knowledge
---
What is the point of this post?
---
&gt;or switch targets.
---
I was considering mage as a main myself but the main thing that made me stray away from them was their rather bland pve rotation, sure they do a lot of damage but if im going to be raiding every week I want the rotation/utility to be fun and engaging. I also don't want to be peoples vending machine.
---
Although hunter dps drops off in the later tiers its still good to have a couple around since they make excellent pullers with feign death, can kite mobs in raid well, and they have tranq shot. One thing to keep in mind with hunters is you have to micro manage your pet a lot so it doesn't die to mechanics.
---
I'd say if you want to be pushing pve content you're better off with mage but for pvp you can't go wrong with either.
---
Your keybinds intrigue me
---
Could you perhaps provide just a shred of evidence? I'll take pserver logs just fine.
---
You get a quest to kill Gahz'rilla in ZF, but you need the mallet to summon it.
---
Oh fuck, I do now.  That shit was so epic
---
My guess is since they ran with 3 warlocks, they had their voidwalkers kill the boss for them.
---
Pretty they're talking about their own guild raid roster, do what the fuck you want
---
Couldn't even attempt to log in till my raid time at 9 pm EST.  Saw my last stress characters were there but it said server down so I figured the servers were jacked.  Then I thought they probably just wiped the characters and didnt remove them from the select screen and made a new guy, worked like a charm.  After raid and after I ate some food, made a gnome lock and made it all the way to level 10 in 3 hours 45 mins lol.  Didn't know where most of the quests were after kharanos.  And man the brewnall village area was rough, had to group for most of it.  I ended up submitting a possible bug report on the quest to kill 8 boars, 6 snow leopard and 6 ice claw bears only because I felt like I saw hundreds of boars around and none of the other ones.  Took a solid 45 mins on that 1 quest (i'm very efficient).  Only finished it cause I randomly found alot more past Ironforge.  Was pretty lucky to loot a 6 slot bag, then found the 5s bags in Kharanos (Ironforge only had 8 and 10 slot bags, no 6 slots).  Leveling up is just so satisfying, hitting level 10 and having to train like 5 spells (was a good 15s or so, but I had it).  
---
Then I tried to find where to start the voidwalker quest, ran all the way to Ironfoge found the trainers, but they had nothing.  Turns out the quest start was just outside them but I missed it since i'm used to seeing quests on the minimap lol.  Ran back to Kharanos, demon trainer had a breadcrumb dialog option to go see a dude in IF.  Treked all the way back, found him, took the tram to SW which still felt pretty epic.  Trained staves and swords there (forgot that was a thing as well).  Got the next part of the voidwalker quest, had to google where the NPC was at ( a good 8 min run).  Finally get there, and its a level 9 and 2 level 10 mobs.  Feared one, set imp on another, and tried to nuke the quest npc I needed.  Sadly forgot to refear so I died but some other people came in and finished them off.  Was able to loot after rezzing (only death I had).  When I was able to finally turn it in and get the quest, man that was more satisfying then just leveling and auto learning Voidwalker or something.  Void walker quest in total took me an hour but I wasted a good 20 mins finding the start lol.

10 levels of an actual RPG felt good.

If they didn't want to get killed they shouldn't have rolled on the wrong faction

Hey dude, no sadly I'm not in the Beta.. But I'll do everything I can to make it ready for launch!

No wonder Alliance players suck, they keep getting neck spasms mid fight.
---
I'm going to try to collectively sum up what others have said here, maybe more eloquently. If nothing else I am trying to be civil so take it at face value. 
---
The changes to the game over the course of the last 15 years were things done to make life easier which at face value is a good thing but for myself shortly into Cata, i found myself less motivated to work for the things that motivated me before. Gearing was a non issue since I could que for 25 minutes hit up a dumbed down version of the endgame content and end up with gear every week. 
---
With this change, i didn't really need a guild. This is one example of many of the little things that came around.    that have culminated into what retail is now, which for me when i login is boring.  The game feels less social overall which is an issue for me wanting to play an MMO.
---
When you hear the "No changes" rhetoric it is really a I have so much to say on this but I don't think you would hear me out anyways because you think these are not bad things and I do. Why bother? 
---
I could go on for a long time and draw up many examples for myself which have driven me away from the retail version of the game.  But for myself and many others like me the bottom line of how I personally view it is You have all of those things that make the game fun for you in retail, enjoy them.
---
Let me have the original for good and bad over here, if you would like to join we will welcome you. Some of the bad stuff is a grind and painful but it is very rewarding at the same time... 
---
Hope this helps...

TLDR: nO cHaNgEs!

No it's not. That's his point. Stop using objectively to describe subjective things, period, even if 99.9999999% of people agree,  hell even if 100% of people agree, it's not objective. Christ.

Waste of gold
---
You're right, IIRC, you could just link your armory right?
---
Razor was the 1st boss right? I don't recall all the details, but wasn't it just split into 5 groups until whelp eggs are down and then it's tank and spank?
---
So a Druid in pre-MC BIS gear has a higher threat cap than a prot war in pre-MC BIS?

Sort of is "us vs them" when blizzard is putting out both modern wow and classic.
---
I feel as though anyone that never played vanilla - wrath will be just fine fitting in the classic community as long as they stick with the game and socialize.
---
They fix the bug. Rveryone you see is in the same layer, if you invite people you see you're already in the same layer so zero phasing should occur. The fact that it does is a bug and should not happen.
---
Welcome to Vanilla lol
---
I see, well good luck
---
Eh, we're talking about a difference of like 10% from pservers to vanilla, so it's not going to elevate hybrid classes significantly. On pservers, you can get away with doing 1.2k+ DPS in many cases if the tank is built for TPS. Getting parried more often isn't going to lead to a TPS drop of the proportions it would take for the top DPS classes have to hold back so much that hybrid classes become competitive. We know from back in vanilla that people got away with doing ~1k DPS, so it's not going to change the class hierarchy in a meaningful way.
---
I started as horde exclusively when I played seriously in BC and Wrath. Now I’m alliance for classic, but really just a dwarf player.
---
I could also go to work, but I don't get paid unless I actually do.
---
Vast majority of vanilla, yes.
---
That low of level Prot spec isnt needed to tank, and in fact would be overkill while losing dps. AoE threat generation is almost non existent for warriors as TClap is not a defensive stance ability. Again at that level, there is not much else to do but tab sunder.
---
That’s like saying school is easy for doctors because most people graduate high school.
---
You did not clear any of the challenging content in the game.
---
That said, I agree, most of Vanilla is easy, but not ALL of it.
---
RS players and retail wow players are in two different categories though.  Retail wow holds your hand and makes ALMOST every single thing obtainable with minimal effort.  Those WoW players coming over, that never played vanilla, have no clue how long it takes just to get to 60, let alone do anything meaningful.  For a VERY casual player (say, 10 hours a week which is pretty realistic) you're talking a couple months minimum before you get the ability to train for mounts.  Even then they probably wont be able to afford it.  
---
Those of us with a plan in place and guilds already formed for raiding will stick around.  Most won't.
---
No they won't- only thing you can do is to search for what servers streamers will go and either join their faction or avoid that server.
---
i don't understand what they did with retail it is so bad. i logged on my 72 main from TBC and my lvl 50 mage... the lvl 50 mage can use all my super difficult to get mounts that were on my main. WTF???
---
who thought that was a good idea.
---
Nope, it makes perfect sense. Don't worry.
---
I found loads more on an old drive. Gets me stoked for classic!
---
Warstomp is nice, so is extra dodge and increased stealth levels. This won't end up mattering as much as you expect. Engineering grenades can get you breathing room if you need it.
---
Moonglow can work with the right gear, but imo is inferior to feral for solo pvp.
---
Re: shamans. Feral druid is missing a lot of utility that makes it work at your level. For example, you don't have ferocious bite which is going to be your biggest burst ability.
---
You also probably don't have furor, so your ramp up time when getting into forms sucks, and you can't charge or bash on demand. I really don't feel like feral druid comes online until the mid to late 40s. Once you have furor and natural shapeshifter.
---
Since you can't rush them down you have to outlast them. 
---
If they're purging your hots you can bait them into ooming by putting up rank 1 rejuvs for them to purge. If you significantly win the mana game you win the fight.
---
 Enh shaman is pretty vulnerable to kiting, so use that to your advantage to let them tick down to dots. 
---
To the above point on purging, you need to try and create enough space to heal up with HT instead of regrowth/rejuv. Those will get purged and you will piss through mana.
---
They’re entitled pieces of shit honestly. They think that because they play the video game or have played the video game since day 1 that they *deserve* to be in the beta. How about this to those who are complaining little bitches: TRADE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR APPRECIATION. if you make it into the beta, be appreciative, if you don’t, appreciate that the game will be released in August for you to play. If you go your life feeling entitled or expecting things, you’re going to end up living your ENTIRE life being disappointed, angry, and unhappy.
---
No need to be prot unless you're the MT of a raiding guild. Why they level arms is a mystery, fury would be optimal till level 40. Fury with a 2h of course. Arms is more PvP oriented which may be why.. 
---
Tabbing and sunder armor is one of the best threat generating techniques you have. Thunderclap costs a lot of rage for not a lot of threat generated - sure mobs hit you less often.. which means less rage for you, which means less threat-per-second, which means your healer and DPS will have a bad time. 
---
Thunderclap is extremely niche tbh. You can do fine by never even buying it. There's way better things to spend rage on - like 2 demo shouts. That's more threat and doesn't slow their attacks, but reduces the dmg quite significantly.
---
It would make EVERY boss like the giant buttclench-fest Patchwerk enrage is. I remember staring at the tank healthbars post enrage praying while furiously smashing my shadowbolt button, as if that would help.
---
Entitled babies at this point. They truly believe they DESERVE to play a BETA.
---
Same reason you get angry over petty things, just because it doesn't line up with your interests or investments doesn't mean it's out of place :)
---
Totally agree.
---
I doubt it. They don't want people to abuse it, so it will be tweaked in silence and not discussed.
---
We might get an overall description of how it should work, but there's to many down sides to explain it in details. People will abuse the fuck out of it.
---
I'm talking about different resist values on mobs in Classic compared to pservers. They're WILDLY different. Blizzard has already commented that armour, damage and resist values are much different. It's pretty nuts tbh.
---
That, and some graphical settings. Looking closer I can see some FOV adjustments for starters. It's all in the angles. But it's a near optical annoyance for sure
---
I have that same flag hung above my set up as well! I actually cut out the white square at the top and I think the flag looks much cleaner. Cheers.
---
&gt; I specifically asked for a non, worthyness explaination.
---
What part of what I said was related to being worthy? Worthy doesn't even apply in Vanilla because you can't go solo old raids and then trasmog gear you didn't earn. Do you know what worthiness means? Did you mean to use another word or something? Because that is what that implies.... 
---
I also never said it told you how strong someone was. It tells you MORE about what build they are going for than if they are literally transmogging random stuff on themselves. That is entirely different. A rogue in blues is just as dangerous as a T1/2 rogue. It's not about that deciding if you can solo someone or not, It's about knowing if a rogue has tanky stam blues or something, he's going to take a bit longer to kill. If he's wearing T1, he has an extra 10 energy that you need to account for. It's about knowing how to prioritize targets, and if you don't judge target priority in PvP based on that, it's totally cool, but other people do.
---
I feel like you are completely missing the point entirely. You have already made up your mind and it doesn't look like you are willing to understand what I am telling you or even care.
---
and I understand that and I can understand why people feel that way I just don't think they are treating it like a brand new game. 
---
I wouldn't mind being wrong about it but I just dont personally see them all of a sudden making brand new classic content.
---
Couldn’t agree more. I hope people give classic a real shot so they can see how good of a game it is. Unfortunately I have a few friends completely unwilling to give it that shot due to time investment. Either way I’m going to enjoy the hell out of it.
---
I agree. I'm really looking forward to the old systems. I personally won't have the time to do them all again, but that's how it should be.
---
Crit suppression was something that wasn't fully understood until WotLK or late TBC, IIRC, mostly because crit rate was so hard to accurately and definitively measure until players started hitting what should have been theoretical 100% crit rates. But there's no logical reason to think crit suppression was added later. As you yourself point out, there weren't really any major combat mechanics changes until Cata.
---
Sometimes people seem to forget that retail vanilla actually existed and these things were never the case there.
---
This is correct. At least this is what they say.
---
Phase 1 is long and if huge exploits exist , it can be detrimental to the economy, world pvp and other major factors
---
Yes in retail it does, that's sharding. Classic doesn't use sharding, it uses layering and this will only happen if you join a group on another layer (you'll disappear and reappear in their layer or they'll appear in yours), or someone in your layer joins a group in a different layer (they'll disappear or the people from the other layer will appear). Those are the only two instances where you will ever seen people or mobs phase in or out when layering works properly
---
yeah. I don't know what these other drawbacks are though, since you can see anyone that you want to party with, trade with anyone else, duel anyone else or chat with anyone you want to chat with.
---
I dont remember the specs, but was playing feral druid and was pretty disappointed. I mean certain legendaries could increase your dps in a big way. That didnt do much for me
---
The alla page you linked says .6%, thottbot says .46%.  Often the values on alla and thottbot were inflated on certain rare items. I don't know what classicdb.ch is and I don't care.  With that proc rate, a fury warr with windfury totem is getting the equivalent of 15% haste from ironfoe (but MH only).
---
1.  If you examine the prot tree, most of the talents don't increase your survivability or threat generation by all that much.  But there are few points from the fury and arms line that can increase your damage which would also increase your threat.  And unless you were the main tank or main/offtank for raid, you had very little reason to go full prot.  In fact, speccing full arms or fury and just having a full tanking set was more than enough for anything outside of raiding.
---
2.  Back in the old days, if the ability did not specifically say, increases threat, as part of the text, then it didn't have increased threat.  Thunder clap as an aoe was weak. So whereas it could grab intial agro, it didn't do enough damage to keep stuff on you for long.  It was also a battle stance ability so you could use clap as a opener, but you wouldn't want to dance back to battle stance just to clap as you were tanking.  waste of rage and was also dangerous as you would take more damage on the switch.
---
Sunder tabbing was your only way to keep your threat up on multiple targets.  AND, back in those days, aoe targeted everything.  So if anything was cc'ed, it would break it.  And unlike now wher eyou can just aoe tank stuff, multiple cc targets were mandatory.  Breaking a cc could mean a wipe.

Warrior can't charge while in combat. They can intercept if they're high lvl enough though.
---
Tank pulled everything, got mad when he died, left group, group fell apart. It took us 3 hours to get to that point.

You can do a lot of abuse in a short time period, especially when people can hit 60 first week
---
Wrath was best for me because Survival Hunter was amazing. Cata ruined hunters with the way they changed auto shot and focus instead of mana.
---
Edit: also fucking kill shot was dope as fuck.
---
Today i was like 30 min in the character screen, thinking about if i should renew my account just to feel a little bit closer to the 27. august...
---
At the same time, it was really nice making a couple hundred off that RMAH.
---
Holy shit. Didn't even realize until you said something.
---
I tried to look at it last night but I only had 1 hours ish of game time to spare -___- and stress test will be over when I get off work today. Maybe next time... Thanks for the info :)
---
Ya this is cool and I appreciate how you explained it in an approachable way. Playing a troll, I’ll definitely make an effort to talk with their accent, but that’s because I want to do that. As a Tauren, I won’t have an accent, but I’ll make an effort to talk how they would. Maybe instead of saying “see you later”, I might say “may the Earth Mother watch over you”, or even “good journey”.
---
#reasons why I play on pve realms
---
Yeah the Manual Crowd Pummeler Maul spamming tank Druids really are going to attack so slowly compared to Warriors, especially on the bosses Druids aren't fit to tank. That last part, at least, wasn't sarcasm.
---
Yeah, but also MCing the boss,  kiting the dragon kin, focusing mages, there's a lot of coordination that goes into the fight. That was 100% a boss that couldnt be casually downed without having the raid all on the same page about what strategy would be used.
---
Thank you all for swift replies.
---
Eye opening &amp; informative.
---
I learned to stop paying attention to content creators/streamers who let themselves get caught up in the negativity group-think that takes good criticism and blows it all up into "the game is dying, people are quitting, like and subscribe to hear more or me talking about the game we loved but why we now hate it". It is just unhealthy and leads to poor perspective. 
---
Same thing happens all over the place though. I have gotten so much amusement at all the "not a bug" stuff the Classic dev's have been churning out that has contradicted so much nochanges purist false information/bad memory/incorrect private server stuff that was touted as gospel around here for the past year. I'm glad they are taking the time to get it right. (Or as right as is possible)
---
A word of comradary to the Horde from the Horde... LOK TAR OGAR
---
I wonder how they would have sorted out the logistical nightmare of Naga mounts.
---
Having to complete the content in order to discuss it isn't a great argument. Otherwise ESPNs entire business model would be out the window.
---
But I get what you're saying. I didn't step foot in AQ40 or Naxx, but I hope to this time around. I still think the vast majority of Vanilla was a lot easier than people remember.
---
Cover the sides of the bath tub in olive oil and put the kids in there when they’re not working - they won’t get out
---
This guys testing was very minimal. If you look at the testing done by the guy who responds, and his questions for the CM— it seems 14% parry didn’t come around until WOTLK.
---
S8 is often regarded as the best arena PvP in the history of wow. According to arenajunkie forums(RIP). MoP is often second talked about. Legion arena participation was also the lowest ever. Yes, less people did arena in Legion than WoD.
---
What happens is that lots of people will go for the epic doomslayer look, but quite a few will go for overalls with a chequered red shirt, a straw hat and a pitchfork instagibbing for 4k whirlwinds, because they have Dark Edge of Insanity and 5/5 t2.5. 
---
I know that because I made god awful transmogs in MoP when gear still mattered to look as dumb as possible in battlegrounds.
---
I loved this fight. It felt so epic!
---
In Vanilla, definitely. TBC probably too. Don't know when it changed
---
Especially on a PVP server. They deserve it.
---
I like games that let you dye gear so that your outfit matches but the shape of the item stays the same. That would help with the issue you're pointing out.
---
They are bringing server sharding which was not present in classic, so whatever happened in that screenshot should not be possible.
---
They probably disabled or made it more lenient for stress test.
---
The 009 Sound System song made me smile. 
---
ALL STAND FOR THE YOUTUBE NATIONAL ANTHEM
---
I am worried because I never played vanilla wow and I don't know how I will handle threat generation.  I love the warlock class and the class fantasy in vanilla wow for it is super appealing to me.  I don't want to be a burden on my guild.
---

---
Gz on getting yours made. Iirc the company that made these got so backed up and overrun by orders or had some sort of internal struggles that they straight up couldn't deliver. I heard so many bad things D:
---
Honestly, I see more elitism from the people who only played private servers because of jealousy.  Most people who played in Vanilla are pretty chill.  Even the one's who raided Naxx.
---
Just a few days ago, I saw some comments on an article about the erroneous bug reports some people make (I.E, party being at 14%, sit cries not triggering Reckoning, etc.) 
---
So many people were on the “You think you do but you don’t” train, saying that these failed bug reports are proof that players don’t really want old school wow, and that it’ll fail because it’s just nostalgia and people don’t actually want a classic experience, that the servers will be dead in 6 months and even one guy saying this whole thing was to show the community how stupid they are for asking for Classic.
---
Man I wanted to backhand some people through my monitor in that thread.
---
Mobs don't parry from behind it will make 0 difference.   
---
8% hitcap is lower than Pservers use, this new info is in fact a buff to melee not a nerf.
---
Transmogrification - The sense of building your character and each peace of tier gear meaning something and feeling closer to completing a set. Plus it lets gauge how much of a badass someone is by an eye shot. If you see some in full T3 + a Thunderfury, you know they're one badass mofo
---
No flying mounts - While a convenient mode of transportation, a key feature of classic world of Warcraft is making the world feel massive and alive. That can only occur if you see other people moving throughout the world. This best occurs with a thriving trade district, and people moving zone to zone on their mounts, or by walking, as opposed to flying 1000 ft in the air flying over everything. It adds a new axis to the dynamic, so instead of just an x and y axis, we now have a x, y, z axis making things feel smaller in comparison. This also helps create a thriving world pvp environment by forcing players of opposite factions to interact. There were some pretty large battles that took place inside blackrock mountain back in the day, which are all the more costly due to world buffs and their impact.
---
AoE looting - Killing an enemy of the same level in WoW can be challenging depending on class, even more so when they have fleeing mechanics, many times they'll die near other mobs. With an AoE loot mechanic you don't have to weigh the cost of aggroing other mobs to potentially loot a mob.
---
Sharding /Cross realm - The key feature of vanilla was grouping with other players. Early on alliance have the infamous hogger quest. I was recently playing on a private server, grouped up with a paladin, mage, and me (warrior) and killed Hogger. When I was about level 20 I was looking for a healer and dps for deadmines. Ended up grouping up with the exact same paladin and mage that I did hogger with - in short this fosters a sense of community.
---
Dual Spec - At its core vanilla is a true RPG game. RPG's come with stat building and choices. With these choices come with consequences. If you want to play an arms warrior for example, you are forgoing to the opportunity to main tank raids, and vice versa (without excessive gold farming). It's this kind of play style that makes vanilla more of a classic rpg where it forces you into picking a role and sticking to it.
---
Raid/Group finder - Destroys the community and socialization aspect. I haven't experienced it first hand, but in retail I've heard people don't even talk in party chat any more. During my private server experiences, we're always joking, communicating, talking etc.  
---
Edit: One other thing - There is no greater feeling than slapping on that first pair of grey shoulder pads that you find on a level 14-20 mob.
---
Idk why but that old wooden shield makes me feel so much nostalgia to being a 13-14 year old Ret Pally in classic and literally have no idea wtf I was doing...
---
“But the shield helps me block and gives me more armor”... those were the days.
---
I loved that part, partially because of how creepy he sounded, and partially because of how *right* he is.
---
You're okay with spending three hours trying to tag mobs for the lottery roll of a low percentage quest item drop?
---
I'm glad you aren't in charge :D
---
The early endgame story for Classic was really the best. You mentioned Onyxia, but she also ties into the Windsor / BRD dungeon which introduces the Dark Iron and their pact with Ragnaros. Those two stories tie into to the Blackrock Spire and Nefarian’s fight to control the mountain, culminating in us fighting him in BWL.
---
That’s the part that I love — Deadmines is connected to BWL through the story of the world.
---
Similarly, Naxx is connected to Tirisfal Glades. AQ was less lore-friendly but the Gates of AQ event pulled in the entire server in a really interesting way.
---
congrats you are now just as bad as the people crying about no beta
---
I think people underestimate how many people used to play WoW in the past but lost interest with new expansions, as well as how much of an influence streamers have on what games viewers play.
---
Retail wow has been dead from a streaming standpoint and it has been for a while. With the exception of a couple streamers, the WoW section on twitch had been a ghost town up until the classic beta came out. Lots of streamers quit retail for the same reasons players did (i.e. meh content, pruning, major reworks to classes they liked, etc). As a result, very few people care about retail player accomplishments anymore (I.e. R1s, guild progression outside of world firsts, etc.). It makes really hard for people to care about their progression in a game that nobody else cares about.
---
Nobody is coming back to WoW to play BfA, but tons of people will come back to Classic. How long they keep playing is a different story, but I expect a lot of the big streamers to stick around for a while given that they've been playing private vanilla servers for years and years, which  means a lot of their viewers probably will too. I also wouldn't take r/wow  (one of the whiniest and neediest communities on the internet) as an accurate depiction of how people feel about grinding.
---
When you factor in the enthusiasm from the streaming community towards vanilla along with how how jaded the community is towards retail, I honestly think Classic has a good chance to be more popular.
---
For me, the raids are better in TBC, and the PvP is different but arguably more enjoyable if you really love arena in this period. Vanilla has much better community aspects/world PvP which is good. I think they're both S tier.
---
So I'm ESFJ not sure what I think about that realy.
---
No you just sound stupid. But hey, transmog isn't in classic so I guess you win anyways
---
There's add on threat meters that work decently well. Definitely play one if that's the class that sounds fun for you. In no way would you be a burden.
---
Who cares if people are upset? everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The statement applies to you too. This sub is full of crybabies on both sides, people crying about not getting into beta and people crying about the people crying.
---
dual wield and pole arms were the only ones that had a level requirement... outside of class requirement
---
I've seen this meme so many times what does the kid actually say?
---
I kept my phone in my pocket while grinding a wall of joints once. I don't do that anymore. That dust buildup is a fuckin' bitch haha
---
I love my fnelf tbh, and I haven't made a male once since actually Vanilla.
---
Probably that chain heal.
---
As a counterpoint I really hated the amount of inflation the game had gold wise, they over pruned many classes, artifact leveling was a pain in the ass and WQs were fun for all of about a day.
---
Wouldn't go with that setup. How about a warrior, a shaman and a mage? That sounds much better to me!
---
THE HAMMER OF EXPERTISE. It was purple and so good.
---
Actually it may not have been that good by the time I was able to actually finish that quest. But it was still purple.
---
Only way that would work is to make resist not part of the iLvL budget, otherwise pure gear would always win out. See how little set gear Paladin BiS lists use.
---
Some of the Green Dragon drops were a good balance of NR and stats, but they were still mostly single-purpose.
---
Objectively, horde is more aggressive with shamans, WotF, stun resist and Warstomp, while alliance is more defensive with paladins, Shadowmeld and pve bonuses to weapon skill.
---
On my server, horde always dominated in pvp. I think there is a thing with aggressive, pvp-oriented geeks being attracted more to horde side, while carebears and roleplay thinking people are attracted more towards alliance. The thugs who want to mess people up, vs. the good guys who want to preserve societal order and peace from large-scale threats of dragons and fire lords.
---
You know, the Stormwind guards will make short work of the odd undead rogue found on the wrong side of the city wall anyways...
---
Not completely true. I remember the very popular “nerf George” video of a fury warrior doing 100k? damage during Nefarian phase 1 in BWL which absolutely blew people’s minds. 
---
Fury might not have been 100% mainstream before Naxx but there’s no way “literally nobody knew” when everyone was sharing videos of thunderfury warriors collecting every buff and exploding dmg meters.
---
No. They're also not generally worse. The only place i'd agree where horde &gt; alliance is that I think its arguable that pvpwise orc is the best race to choose for any class that can choose it. That stun resist is nuts.
---
Tidbits like this are so cool.  I wonder what the game would have been like had they made different choices on some things.  
---
Not sure which faction naga would've fit into.  Maybe a third faction?
---
I thought about doing this with rogue, one to play with the guild, one to pug mc and reserve bindings. If the alt rogue ever got TF, switch it to the main. Its hardcore and stupid but so am I
---
I bet you’re fun at parties
---
It's not braindead, it's a supported part of the macro API and has been for over a decade.
---
Decursive was auto-targeting/casting decurse on the raid with a single button push. Healbot was doing that with heals, while also selecting the rank and spell to be most mana efficient.
---
This is not anywhere near the same thing, whatsoever.
---
It's simply: "if in stance &lt;X&gt; cast &lt;Y&gt;"
---
    #showtooltip Overpower
---
    /use [stance:1] Overpower
---
    /use [stance:2/3] Battle Stance
---
|Stance|Number|
---
:-:|:-:|
---
|Battle|1|
---
|Defensive|2|
---
|Berserker|3|
---
It still requires 2 button pushes, the same as it would if they were separate buttons.
---
I use similar macros for modern WoW depending on what talent I have selected as some talent rows have 3 different active buttons to choose from, I make a macro that will cast the correct spell based on which talent I've chosen so I simply don't have to dig through my spellbook every time I switch said talent. It doesn't make it braindead, it just saves actionbar space.
---
&gt;You only have drooling troglodytes in your faction and somehow Horde picked up all the good PVPers. It sucks, but that's what it is.
---
that's not even remotely toxic. thanks :D
---
%100 this. I loved Gnomeregan for it's charm. It was an entertaining instance. ST just felt... dreary and repetitive.
---
Yeah but having a rogue and doing what the class is supposed to do, is fine.
---
But kazzak to a city? After 5 mins, nobody would be having fun....as the server would need shutdown to reset.
---
take plains walking from tauren and give it to nagas with another name - done.
---
Then we’d be left with half full servers that need to be merged.
---
What’s the difference between 2 servers that merge at the end of p1 or 1 server with 2 layers at the end of the day? 
---
Layering costs less than additional servers and I’m willing to bet a lot less manhours then doing significant server merges.
---
Definitely master race
---
Unless banshee was a race
---
&gt; Transmog was the worst addition to wow
---
So you think Dungeon Finder, LFR, phasing, sharding, and cross realm zones are better additions than transmog?
---
that's really helpful. thanks!
---
Hoping they implement it before launch. My next laptop cpu probably will just barely be able to hit 4 ghz but it will certainly have 4+ cores to make up for it if they implement multithreading.
---
No need to resort to insults. If you have good arguments, you don't need them.
---
BFA has transmog, so feel free to play that to your heart's content.
---
I get that this is another one of these posts, but how is transmogging "against the spirit of the game"?
---
Fuck heirlooms though. I wish they added some other mean to level your alts faster than just gear.
---
It's way easier on your schedule to play on an EU server as NA (rather than NA as EU), can always find a guild that raids on weekends and simply play early in the day. There might even be a native language server for you to play on. On top of this, if you happen to move back to Europe, you won't be stuck with the dilemma of playing on servers where you can basically never raid due to the time difference (gl fitting 4-5 AM raid starts into your schedule).
---
I would for sure eat the \~120-150ms connection speed in favor of these things.
---
This is awesome! Really does show the introvert skew that helps build the gamer stereo type
---
exactly my point, thanks.
---
Oh wow, that's a really good reason.
---
software dev here
---
as a beta for a game especially like this the game is most likely completed enough to enjoy and not much will change in terms of content
---
people wanted beta to try out and test things before it goes live, many reasons why someone might be passionate to do this.
---
I dont agree with or understand streamer hate tho
---
do you even undestand the costs of all of these things energy? its not free.
---
blind and sap is the only good and relieable  but ppl have trinkets you know.
---
1 target hard cc is not useful also vs a hunter that places a flare on chokepoint.
---
Do what you like rogue is fun but they are absolute garbage in orginized 3+ players pvp grouped.
---
Small groups and numbers they are good but once you get to the number of 3+ players they becomes more and more useless.
---
But 4 hours is quite a long time and allows them to maybe be in a different zone or an entirely different area of a zone that'll be difficult to find them.
---
Dude c'mon, it's kinda obvious. No one was suggesting a server with 30 people
---
Why? Could have done it simply like Worgen Travel ability.
---
lol PvP in vanilla = "This class beats this class 99.9% of the time".
---
sorry guys, pizza pops&gt;hot pockets, if you haven't had pizza pops you haven't lived
---
T3 was used in a lot of early Karazhan clears, but something as good as DEoI was replaced by a L66 Nagrand quest reward. Most Heroic dungeon loot replaced even the best L60 gear.
---
Depends who you ask. Some people prefer the janky pure fun that was Vanilla. Some people prefer the improvements made in TBC, mainly being able to play Pally/Shaman and the addition of Draeni/BE, two of the most popular races even now. A lot of people also came in during Wrath, where the Lich King was super hype and the game was made a lot more easy and accessible to more casual people without being a complete joke or ruined. I think Wrath is considered by most to be the height of WoW, both in terms of subs and quality of the game.
---
Vanilla might be the hypest of the three though because it's essentially a reboot and a return to its roots. If we were to take three alternate universes where Blizzard launches Vanilla/Classic like they are now, and the other two launch TBC and Wrath respectively, despite Wrath being generally the favorite, I think more people would still come back for Classic over Wrath. A lot of people are definitely hoping we get a TBC and Wrath version eventually though.
---
One thing most people can agree on though is that it all went down hill after Wrath and finally fell straight into a pit in WoD, where it tried to crawl back out of the pit in Legion only to fall right back in with BFA.
---
Heirlooms is needed in retail because end game is about 90% of the game. You are just ment to get to max level as fast as possible. In classic, the road to lvl 60 is about 50% of the game.
---
Retail: the game starts at 120
---
Classic: the game starts at lvl 1
---
I think they mentioned they may remove it earlier if population drops rapidly enough
---
From your own post, maybe.
---
&gt;I have RL obligations like a wife, a kid, and another kid on the way that I just can't drop on a whim to log on and get someone something out of the gbank
---
Same way they did Tauren and Worgen
---
I don't know man, A LOT of people are fed up with bfa and don't plan on returning until next expansion if at all.
---
The thing is, Classic doesn't need to cater to retail wow players to be more popular. Far more people have quit wow than play wow, and I think the people who complain about grinds make up a small minority of historical wow players.
---
Personally, I have no problem with intense grinds in a game that actually matters and feels rewarding like Classic does. Any progression I had done in BfA before quitting was easy, but I just felt like: "What's the point?" The gaming community as a whole gives 0 shits about retail WoW.
---
They say in the video that the earliest database data backup they have is from 1.12...
---
I like flying mounts! But the dungeon finder and gearscore (and later transmog) were the things that broke the game for me back in WotLK and took all the soul out of the game.
---
I never played wow before, I am excited.
---
Kill videos were common, they were just downloaded from places like WarcraftMovies instead of streamed. I still remember one Illidan kill video available to stream in HD from Stage6 using Xvid.
---
Phasing has nothing to do with layering and is the cause of the bulk of the complaints.
---
Snekrunning
---
*sigh*
---
"I think thats a problem. But classic gbank plz"
---
Mind giving me an ELI5 version of what that means? I'm reading an article about server sharding but it isn't enough layman's terms for me
---
This is what i fear aswell, and atleast half of what made vanilla so magical was wierd rumours that sometimes happened to be true, but most of the time it were just rumours.
---
I remember a rumour about a dragon hiding in duskwood, I was like "what?! Nooo... Duskwood is all worgen and undead, mate!" then when i saw him it blew my mind.
---
Now we will just have people telling you to Google it. End of discussion. No adventure to be had.

---
It's not very convincing, especially because the nr.1 guy is apparently a prot pally aoe tanking. However, that's because Esfand didn't put his pally together well (and also, there are a lot of mechanics in Naxx that dont favor melees). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-B4n8ruIyQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-B4n8ruIyQ) This might change your mind. Keep in mind that this guy only has AQ and pre-AQ gear, and does 200 more dps(and not even using all his consumables AND he only used rank2 consec). 
---
But, retri isn't really about topping DPS, it's about topping damage dealt. You have a lot of procs that deal little damage that lowers the actual DPS, but it adds up in terms of damage dealt. Esfand himself (pre-aq) hits top10 and top5 DPS easily. Pudgy hits top5 in Naxx aswell (given he has Sulfuras, but even without that, you can be top 10 dps).
---
These videos may further change your mind:

Edgy people play Horde to feel like they are playing the bad guys or monsters, they tend to take PvP more seriously.  Players are good on both factions, but more probably go to Horde, at least in my experience.
---
What relevance does that have? The honor system is being tested on beta right now, with the first weekly ranking update being yesterday, a guy called Esfand got standing 1 and afaik got somewhere into rank 3 from being unranked.
---
lol private servers have dynamic respawns and phased starting zones
---
BUR. PALADIN POLICE FORCE COMMIN FOR YOU
---
I used to care way too much about how my armor looked, but once transmog came out I got really apathetic towards getting new gear since it didn't affect my look anymore. Going back to the old system will at least get me a little more motivated to run stuff again.
---
Sitting in goldshire sapping and trolling people isn’t what a rogue was made to do lol, not that it matters much to me, but I’ve been in many discussions where people like that have had their account hacked because they would troll the same person over and over and that person ended up hacking their account, taking all of their stuff and then getting it banned (though I’m sure accounts can be recovered). It is a dick move on both sides imo.
---
  I absolutely agree on your kazzak note though, it makes everyone angry and would absolutely cause hell.
---
It's pretty wild but desktop pcs have become a nitch. My 12yo cousin can barely use a computer. He grew up with a tablet/phone. He is even learning to program on a tablet. I don't think he can type on a physical keyboard and a mouse is like a rotary phone to him
---
Certainly Warcraftmovies existed. But guides were text back then. You can only learn so much about a boss strat by watching a kill video. 
---
Is it searchable from mainland China, though?
---
Doesn’t explain Horde domination after Vanilla.
---
I am on ND as well and wow its just rocketed up. I have seen it around 12k people! I am lvl 14 and in the barrens and my god its hard to get any mob tags haha.
---
Wait until you find a 10 slotter
---
You won't be "phasing around" and losing tags with Layering
---
&gt;  PvP mandates that other players have a chance to see what gear you are wearing.
---
How do you feel about players being able to hide their cloak/helm and tabards that cover most chest/leg armor? Really the only thing you can see is shoulders and weapon.
---
Even then there's always noggenfogger and savory deviate delights to hide all of your armor.
---
Didn't the latter exist for awhile after the new models were added but got removed?
---
I like pvp and grinding little check boxes so I play sea of thieves.  it is on both pc and xbox.
---
It was changed to work in combat in wotlk.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shadowmeld](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shadowmeld).
---
In that case, you will have to get to Exalted reputation with Sen'Jin Village, and buy it from them.
---
When I was young we all played alliance and then moved horde as we got older. Could be just older experienced players went horde.
---
even low level content is exciting when it is vanilla
---
The horde racials are better for PvP. Resist stun, remove fear, stun, more dps..The players on the Alliance are more skilled. Humans racial is great as a rogue trying to catch other stealthers. Dwarf Rogue can use storm form with Shadowcloak to dispel everything so you can vanish. Shadowmeld is great to gank, and Gnomes warriors with escape artist is what warriors need
---
In general, Noobs and Pros play Alliance. Everyone else is Horde
---
No it doesn't, because it's a stupid argument. It only applies to rogues, who have the leisure to pick and choose their opponents from stealth.  So "because PvP rogues want it that way", everyone else in all playstyles should not have a QoL feature? Gee, how generous of you!
---
That was the accepted formula for bosses hitting players. Not for players hitting bosses. 
---
Everyone I know that played back then knew that bosses had higher parry. Anyone who didn't know that either didn't play a tank or didn't play a melee or didn't read any contemporary theory craft in late Vanilla/early TBC, or has only played on private servers.
---
I remember it being estimated as ~7-8% over what would be expected from the weapon skill vs defense calculation. When expertise was added to the game in TBC, it was well known that tanks should treat zeroing out dodge as a soft cap, and that there would still be a lot of parry left on the attack table. This wasn't a new discovery with expertise. It was something people already knew about tanking bosses and applied to the expertise change.
---
If you like it in BfA, more power to you, I suppose.
---
Well, I know it's not going to be accurate, just wanted to hear some opinions.
---
It won't
---
If you log into your account and go to game downloads, its fairly far down the list under legacy/classic games or something along those lines
---
My friends and I always do ponytail bc I hate short hair but having the hair down looks like I'm about to go out, not fight orcs.
---
&gt; blizzard expects player numbers to not be very big
---
When did they say this? I'd be shocked if Classic WoW didn't have millions of players at launch.
---
I started in Vanilla and I loved TBC. If I could have TBC without flying I’d do it in a heartbeat
---
the horde have better racials for PvP  but the gear/skill of the pvper matters the most.
---
What percentage of people do you think will hit 60 within 7 calendar days of Classic's launch?
---
RDFG for movement maybe.
---
&gt; My issue with transmog is it just doesn't make any sense. How can one piece of cloth look like something completely different? 
---
How does eating a fish turn you into a pirate or ninja?
---
The game is high fantasy and magic is everywhere.
---
I agree, stun resist can be the difference. Thanks
---
a paladin sure can dispel but lets put it this way, another player a warrior can do the same thing but better.
---
ppl need to get thru their skulls rogues are absolute garbage in orginized pvp.
---
they are good in ab for one reason and that is snatching caps  in GM.
---
a paladin can use BoF on the rogue, but its dispellable. problem is rogues dont deal much dmg they are only hated becuse they can stunlock players in 1vs1 and kill no trinket or pvp geared players without them being able to do anything about it also its not like they kill the target fast.
---
The rogue have to choices deal shit dmg and stunlock or deal avarage dmg.
---
they however have sick burst when overgeared vs clothies. but that is you overgear another player.
---
anyone can overgear aimshot and kill a target with crit combo with multishot.
---
PoM pyro mage.
---
like all of these exsists. you cannot rely a class on its long cds.
---
then everyone would be BM hunter. more or less. BW 24/7 op as shit.
---
I'd recommend druid. Chi is basically combo points with energy plus you're hyper mobile and have great heals
---
Because there are many troubled folks in gaming communities. This one is particularly rough.
---
Tauren can spam /moo when you Heroic strike spam for top mental warfare, sending the alliance into traumatic flashbacks of the Secret Cow level in D2
---
As proven by the surprise 14% boss parry announcement most Vanilla theorycrafting  is way off.
---
Until we can test on classic servers it's pointless to dev something now.
---
Sure, no one asked that other tanks than Warriors be made viable, other healers be on par with Paladins/Priest, for druids to have different looking animal forms, no one asked for the ability to turn into a raptor, no one asked for races to ride all the mounts. Blizzard thought all that shit up themselves. 
---
Get out. Did you even play Warcraft or do you just sit on the forums ranting at random things to think your smart? Almost everything implemented was at one time asked on the forums, they didn't need a poll because that shit was on their posted by multiple people with huge threads.
---
I can see that many of you say orc is the best race to pick for PVP. thanks
---
Who is Mark Kern?
---
Orcy McOrcface
---
I was surprised at how well made the song was
---
Everyone who wasn't a tank in our guild had to have these for Sartura
---
"It's an entirely different kind of flying"
---
I think you'll find the people who played vanilla are old farts who doesn't give a damn about min-max or being elitists. 
---
I'd blame the Hyped-for-classic first time retail players who theory craft the hell out of the game before it's even close to out. But that's just life on retail and what they're used to. They don't know any better ^^
---
Give it a few weeks of actual playing and I suspect it'll be very chill. But don't hold back on that ignore button early on!

Your username is perfect, from now on.

Wow would have made more sense with 3 or 4 factions. 
---
Naga, forsaken, and blood elves.
---
Humans, dwarves, and gnomes
---
Orcs, Trolls, and Tauren
---
Night elves and... I guess dryads and shit would make the 4th one.
---
Pretty much lining up with the WC3 factions, lorewise, would have made more sense. 
---
But it would have been probably been unworkable to have even 3 factions (like 30% more content to develop at least), let alone 4.  
---
But barring different faction make up, naga would have to join Horde because of Naga vs. Night Elf, I think.
---
Fade doesn't permanently reduce threat.
---
It's disappointing to see all these TBC babies downvote me in a vanilla WoW forum.
---
I think it took me like 20+ days of /played to level. Maybe more. I  hated it
---
Yea, aint no way somebody who had "4h on farm" in vanilla is gonna be carrying 15 dudes, or anywhere close to it.
---
I am not a frothing #nochanger ... HOWEVER, if they start adding power creep (forward progression and a continued gear treadmill -- which will inevitably require catch-up mechanics and balancing, etc) then I will be done with the game. 
---

Contact me through feedback@wowhead.com so I can investigate. Just include your username/email for the account please.

I think it's baked into a different setting, when I messed around in the beta client, I set everything to low and my view distance went down. If all else fails you can always adjust it through console.
---
Betting against the game being successful seems like an iffy proposition.
---
To be fair, Wildstar made an impressive attempt. I loved it. Too bad the optimization issues made people lose interest and the pvp sucked.

&gt; level 12 Warrior has wearing Dreadnaught
---
That's not how transmog works. A level 12 warrior could not wear Dreadnaught because they would have had to collect it at some point. They also still have to meet the item requirements. Restrictions like level, armor/weapon skill, class, and profession would still apply.
---
Do we know anything about how you get picked for the Classic Beta? As long as you have an active account and you have that box checked you might get picked, and thats all there is to it?
---
Hi, /u/wehrmann_tx
---
They've floated it up to phase 2...
---
The only things considered "impossible" by actual raiders in Vanilla -- not non-raiding scrubs, children, people still stuck in MC in 2006, etc. -- were specifically the bugged version of C'thun and 4 Horsemen before people figured out the 8 tank rotation. That's it. Literally nothing else was ever considered "impossible" in Vanilla by anyone who actually seriously raided.
---
remember when "grats" on leveling was a thing? can't imagine anybody saying it on BfA
---
*pushes up glasses* uhm exCUSE ME but thish shubreddit is for CLASSIC WOW ONLY so go ahead and show yourshelf out
---
I see that Elwyn Forest wallpaper... Eyeing up his targets. Makes complete sense.
---
As a group of level 10s clearing RFC, I'd like to take a moment to applaud your healer for being able to handle keeping the group from wiping without going oom every 5 secs, especially since druids can't rezz.
---
I'm 99% sure all zones have a single flight path.  I don't even think ashenvale has zoram strand flight path.
---
So I've leveled all classes today to level 10. I've found a total of 4 bags across all characters - two on my warrior, one on my druid and one on my hunter. 
---
Compared to pservers, they are actually godlike rare to find imo. It heightens value of tailoring early game which is pretty cool
---
This is honestly the case for my guild as well who was also in Naxx.
---
Yeah, that's fair. 
---
Maybe it's just the horde are more vocal about their wins :)
---
It's functionally the same as sharding in the retail, except the pool of people it pulls from would be only the server and its multiple layers. The main drawback is the same one you'd experience in retail right now, which is people just randomly disappearing once you cross zones,you just now would have the added benefit of knowing that the people you see in a zone and the ones disappearing are on your server.
---
Yeah but I remember doing UBRS for the first time with another rogue that was wearing devout shoulders so having a dps paladin or warrior with a shield isn't particularly surprising.
---
why do shamans become unstoppable killing machines? windfury?
---
Hopefully he’s at peace now buddy! Next time youll do this fight for him :)
---
Fifteen+ years worth of monthly fees and their server tech is still crap.
---
What? What’s the point?
---
Yea never understood why people angle their monitors like that when they have two.
---
Of the English language?
---
Have you played BFA? Mythic+ sounds like what you're looking for.
---
To be honest it annoyed me in Vanilla when people would announce this nonstop in guild chat and then complain when no one responded.
---
If you ask me they ever need to have really strict race/class choices or have no restrictions at all.
---
Assholes are everywhere. Ignore them.
---
I have no idea what happened to all my screenshots from back then, really wished I had them.
---
You'll get plenty of use out of Escape Artist, and the Int bonus is nice.
---
The arcane resistance is whatever, and the Engineering is... actually useful in both PvE and PvP, but not necessary.
---
Aside from that, the Human racials don't benefit you all that much. The Rep bonus is probably the best.
---
The spirit bonus won't be noticeable unless you stack mad spirit which would be silly as a Warlock. Mace spec is useless. Perception? You have a pet for that.
---
Sword spec? Weird flex, but ok... you should be wanding if you're attacking.
---
How else you going to get snap aggro on more than 1 target?  Tab sunder for 4 targets takes 6 seconds, which means no heals until that long.
---
You only EVER go human for 2 reasons.
---
1. You REALLY hate the looks of the other races.
---
2. You're playing melee and only plan on doing PvE pretty much.
---
The other races just have better racials.
---
I've heard feral gets crazy because RIP scales high with ap.
---
Don't see hunter going up much adding serpent sting.
---
Warlocks with dots?
---
That is an excellent point. I have not thought about that. 
---
I believe that's the deciding factor.
---
Cheers!
---
It’s the only character I have ever levelled so I’m hoping I can go warrior again and ignorance will be bliss!
---
Lol unless your friends computer is down the street from you, blizzard can see you just traveled to a different city, probably a different state, in just seconds. 
---
This is why humans don’t actually do the banning. An automated system catches you just went hundreds or thousands of miles in less than a minute.
---
I think he wants blizzard to make one when the game comes out. TBH I would play on it.
---
It's still going to be necessary. They'll turn it off once it isn't anymore. Nothing else needs to be said anymore.
---
Ah didn't know stats were adjusted, that does throw a wrench into everything.
---
Classic and Retail will have the same # of players. Only blizzard will know.
---
Are those a non-US thing? What's a pizza pop
---
Wait, Thrall’s weapon is Doomhammer? I thought Doomhammer referred to Orgrim Doomhammer, or was Doomhammer’s weapon the Doom hammer that Thrall inherited?
---
Subscribers and players aren't the same thing.
---
Dwarves only have a frost resistance, and that's due to being acclimated to cold weather.
---
Look up what was super meta last season and check patch notes to see if it was nerfed, ezpz.
---
GG items are made in the lategame by people will lots of disposable currency.  There is no point for a new player to be worried about crafting until endgame.
---
Hello! I got mine as well a couple weeks ago. Due to travel I haven’t been able to play but on Saturday I will be able to.
---
- opted in, was part of the open beta during blizzcon. 
---
- I have a small twitch account but no real followers lol. I think I have 3.
---
- sub expired for about 16 months
---
- not currently playing bfa, loved legion but never came back
---
- US
---
- account created in 2008
---
- I didn’t make it to vanilla...but I was always envious.
---
I’m pretty out of the woodwork and can’t wait to play. I liked the open beta very much because of the “teamwork” and slower combat. I felt like I was playing my character as opposed to playing a story.
---
find waldo.
---
Seeing how the system works out under load and finding out what potential exploits there might be is the point of beta dont you think? So why do we have this question 3 months before launch already.
---
as opposed to the beautiful vanilla and tbc launches that worked beautifully
---
It seems ZG is going to be released in Phase 2. As for attack speeds, the only normalisation that seems to have occurred by 1.12 is 1.) Run speeds, 2.) Lupos doesn't do Shadow Damage.
---
Haha alright, thats a post 60, post gold/BIS grind then!
---
... och spelar lite DotA
---
Blizzard will still only know how many people are truly playing classic so point is moot
---
You're a good person indeed :O
---
Is it intended for the boss to be affected by snares? or is it a bug?
---
UBRS included?
---
Or RR every single drop and crafting material :p everyman brings his own consumables, no need for a guild bank ever.
---
Or I can be your guild bank, sent everything to me. Np.
---
Which is true... but I believe it gives something to go off of.

Oh absolutely. I hate how every game has females as just being sexy humans with different skin color and other small features. 
---
Female Tauren are like the only female race that isn't just a female human with a few tweaks.

Hi, /u/scrootmctoot, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
They aren't betting against it, it's a hedge.  They don't want to have too many and be left with some dead servers
---
You've done well in defeating those uncultured savages. Return to the glory of Stormwind and claim a hero's rewards.
---
Lolol like Ion said... 
---
Did he say what happens when we are 3 months into classic and servers still have 12k+ players?
---
Nope he's only said what you want to hear for launch.
---
How many frames were you getting?
---
Foss crafting is preeeetty good. You should look into that.
---
As an example, when You want to craft a high Energy Shield Vaal Regalia, You use a couple of Dense fossils. 
---
The fossil increases the odds of getting ES rolls and has a chance to roll 25-50% increased ES as a suffix(!) meaning You can get 3 ES prefixes AND an ES suffix meaning pretty much any regalia crafted with dense that hits the somewhat rare ES suffix will be better than one You pick from the ground. 
---
And this is just the tip of the iceberg, I say start looking into fossil crafting gear for Your build and You will learn the ropes. That's how I started learning crafting and it paid off greatly in the end. Good luck!
---
To be this dull... and if / when the pop doesn't drop... then what?
---
The last part. Doomhammer is the Orc and the weapon that Thrall inherited.
---
BRD, Mara, SFK
---
Yes, thrall inherited it.
---
Lol so phase 4 with pops at 12k, "we still need it guise"
---
No, there is no evidence that any elite damage is off or boss damage is off from how it was in vanilla.  That's what their video of the deadmines boss demonstrated.
---
Also I don't agree with the supposition that everyone was terriblen 14 years ago.
---
In fact, I think that the positions taken on this sub relative to private servers are blatantly nonsensical.  They conclude we were all terrible 14 years ago, but yet on private servers everything was twice as hard and despite being twice as hard people leveled in 1/2 the time and cleared raid bosses significantly faster.  Some people were probably terrible but players who played seriously and went for BIS shit knew what they were doing, particularly in serious raid guilds.
---
You have not been in Undercity, have you?
---
Kala you are my hero. Been following your stuff since early HotS days and now your into classic WoW. Love your content, keep it up. 
---
On a side note I think you met/talked to one of my best friends, Brody or Oni ingame, in the HotS era a out making a site, wish I got to meet you.
---
&gt; Far more people have quit wow than play wow
---
And most of those players who quit have simply moved on to other things. WoW and other MMORPGs are not part of their life any more. They're not coming back regardless.
---
A few rough days or weeks in the beginning are preferable to what I expect will end up being permanent and pervasive sharding in what we thought was going to be the recreation of Vanilla.
---
These kinds of tools are too easy to justify using beyond their expiration date since they make things more convenient. It takes a rare and wise design lead to realize that convenience should not be the goal.
---
I played during the TBC launch and it was fine. Congested in Hellfire Peninsula for the first 24ish hours on my server but never an issue after that.
---
and it can't exist in vanilla or TBC as the demand on indivual player skill is a lot higher on avg. you couldn't have a situation like you bringing a bad shadow priest for the mana as he would then fail on the fights and wipe the raid.
---
however having class/spec carry demands has it's own advantages that made classic and TBC what it is. they are all to me great versions of WoW for there own reasons.
---
however afterwards a lot of what made WoW, WoW was lost. a lot of it did drain away with WotLK due to the later design choises. but cata was the first exp pack you saw people play the entire expantion in the que finder.
---
oh well I guess they fixed it because when you run with another player to redridge or stormwind or westfall they stay on the screen.  same thing if you are taking a ship or boat to cross continents they are there on the other side.  people do disappear next to you, meaning they invited or were invited to another party which is cross layer.
---
In vanilla there is only full integers, no ratings that convert into decimals. That +8% in the picture is 8% hit from items like, for example, the [rogue class trinket](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18465) from DM, [AV Exalted Ring](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19325) and [DMT Ring](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18500).
---
Sunken Temple, yes. Great dungeon. Gnomeregan, though... eww.
---
UBRS, ST, and Maraudon win for me.
---
Spot on. I read this sub at work and despair. How am I gonna last in this cacophony of subnormal losers openly desperate to escape their unfulfilling existence? 
---
Then I get on beta when I get home and it feels just like Vanilla. Spontaneous interactions with people who generally seem decent, wsg group with no one complaining or being toxic, people helping each other with the defias messenger, etc.
---
Things will be worse in retail when more of the psever folks are in, but generally this sub isn't a good gauge of the community overall.
---
Oh yeah I’m not gonna defend ST one bit haha. Way too long for the rewards. Kinda torture to make us run it with the green dragons quest later on in the patches 😫
---
1. You have 400 dps with shadowpriests doing 500 who are literal buff bots.
---
2. 650 dps in Naxx ready gear with full worldbuffs? Hunters do this dps unbuffed in naxx
---
3. I can't see the dps, all I see is some random raid with a paladin no idea what server what core and what the others are doing.
---
4. Esfand minmaxing in a guild that's complete garbage.
---
5. Again no dps meters. And somehow mages are beating him in BWL? And where's the warriors or rogues?
---
I did RFC for a few hours last night as a tank. Yep, got destroyed a lot. Could only take a small number of hits. We kited a lot and I ended up hamstringing and following mobs chasing the mages more than I tanked.
---
For the alliance!  You'll soon realize you chose correctly.  We have paladins and majestic castles and badass mountain fortresses, can't go wrong!
---
Can't wait for all the "Its a stress test / beta, it will be fixed for launch"
---
That's 90 days away...
---
I strongly doubt feral tanks will become the new meta. For one thing, it wasn't the case back then--and contrary to popular belief, late vanilla wasn't some kind of stone age where nobody knew how the sun came up in the morning. There's simply no way that ferals ended up being the better tanks and nobody ever found out. I personally played a feral tank after the big druid patch made it a real spec, and there was a lot of talk at the time and a lot of experimenting to see if it was viable. The conclusion was the same as it is today. The order of the classes is not a concept that comes from private servers.
---
Besides, druids are arguably even worse off against higher parry chance than warriors are. Almost all feral threat comes from maul, so parries are a huge hazard. If your first two swings get parried, or you get a few in a row later on, it's disastrous. Warrior threat is spread out much more over a multitude of sources and is far better innoculated against bad luck. It'll decrease TPS by the same average percentage for both classes, but it'll cause much more spiky inconsistency for druids than for warriors. And druids can't get weapon skill, so they can't reduce the chance to get parried. Druids have no reason to celebrate a higher parry chance.
---
While warriors see more incoming damage from parry haste than druids do, it can't be overstated how much tankier warriors are. Druids take *way* more damage in general, and their tanking role comes mostly from their huge hp pool and armor which makes them better for soaking spike damage in a select few fights. They aren't good at reducing a boss' sustained damage output. Druids are terrible for that. They have less avoidance, they don't have block, they get critted a lot, and they lack the -10% global damage reduction of defensive stance which is a huge deal against boss mechanics. And parry haste is nothing but sustained damage, it isn't spike damage, so druids are once again hurt more than warriors are by getting parried more often.
---
Druids are **very bad tanks** for standard boss tanking when the content is a challenge. They're fine if the content is so easy that nothing matters, and they have niche advantages in specific fights such as soaking Patchwerk's Hateful Strike which can't crit or crush and always hits the secondary tank who can build entirely around surviving that one source of damage. Things like that, or mechanics where being an animal is relevant, is what feral tanks are for. Their higher TPS is good in speedruns as well. They're way too far behind warriors in general tanking power for a 9% increase in boss parry chance to ever come close to elevating druids above warriors.
---
Could you imagine, a frost mage with stoneform?  No more bleeds or poisons and just waltz away.  Plus they could go invisible back then too.  You'd just get rekt.
---
Engineering is useful for both pve and pvp. Especially if you're alliance and have to deal with undead rogues (although, grenade stuns are useful in virtually every situation). 
---
In that case, either be prepared to spend a lot of money, or level a gathering alt (or both).
---
Elemental shamans. Not enhancement.
---
Elemental shamans scale crazy on gear and in AQ40 the full 5set all gives spellpower, stam, int and crit. A shaman with 5/5 t2.5 is just ridicules.
---
My biggest problem is that it killed pvp. Damage in wotlk was extremely high, especially compared to tbc, so much so that pro arena players were dying in globals. Add in the bullshiterry that was death knights who were just head and shoulders above all the other classes for what feels like the entire xpac. And the shit cherry on top is that certain specs where just gutted or death knights had something that just made them obsolete (being able to remove HoTs cause fuck resto druids amirite). Wotlk introduced an insane damage spike that was really never corrected and while some people hated the slow burn that was tbc arena at least it rewarded skill rather than just burning cooldowns to one shot someone at the start of the match. And wotlk had other issues like lfg, insane amount of dalies and rep grinds, blizzard being clueless on how they want to do difficulty in raids and other small things that just add up.
---
I bet that if you go to the app store 2 days  after Diablo Immortal is released, it'll say 1+ million downloads. They might not be from the wow classic subreddit where everyone seems to be a genius but there is a HUGE market for D:I. I'm coining the term D:I now because it's gonna be huge and millions of people will be playing it. Regardless of your petty opinion on a blizzard mobile game before it's even in beta and have no clue.
---
The only reason to go tailoring as a Warlock is the Robe of the Void, which you'll be replacing as soon as you get into MC.
---
It was too expensive to try and fit all the created armour on the Naga, and their unique bodystructure caused some other technical difficulties. It's mentioned in "The WoW Diary" by John Staats
---
It's not a hedge it's a gamble.
---
It's a solution that only works or makes sense if population drops dramatically in the first 3 months.
---
In Vanilla, yes, you would proc "when crit" effects while sitting, which allowed for various things (e.g., Reckoning stacks, quick Warrior threat generation, etc.). Classic does not have this feature—you still take double damage, but it doesn't proc when crit effects—so don't worry about it.
---
😈 If you only played Ultima Online 1997.  
---
*yawn*
---
Me: I forgive him if he admits he was wrong
---
You: "Stop being moron." [sic]
---
Also you: "This community is so toxic. Why do I come here?!"
---
You can also drop Tailoring after you stop using the Bloodvine set.
---
Cut to 3 months in and the populations are exactly the same if not MORE and we still have layering in phase 2. Lololol
---
Bloodvine set is BiS until Naxx and gives +crit for the full set.
---
Gotta agree on that one.
---
As much as I dislike transmog, teleporting straight to the ~ride~ dungeon and all the god damn cross realm stuff (including BGs in 1.12) is far worse. They ruined the experience of being in a world.
---
&gt; Many private servers still give Arcane Missiles a proc dip per missile (41% per cast) rather than 1 on successfully reaching the cast point of the first missile. (Vanilla)
---
Possible my memory is poor, or the mechanic changed between Vanilla and Wrath, but I'm fairly confident that the chance per AM tick was present at least during ToC when Arcane was viable. I remember being annoyed when Clearcasting would overwrite itself during AM since it felt like a waste.  
---
e: Now that I think about it, it might have been more to do with chaining AM procs.
---

/sit makes you get crit by mobs, and reckoning and enrage procs off crits, but they aren't supposed to proc off crits while you are sitting, that's a pserver bug, so /sit should be pointless in classic.
---
Yeah its not super hard to go from Theramore-Barrens-Stonetalon-Ashenvale-Darkshore either, maybe a 20-30 min run at most and most mobs are not higher than 20 so at least it's not total one-shots.  Plus you get a few flight paths.  It can be good to do multiple 'starting zone' type places you get a bunch of extra rep and quest XP while stuff isn't grey yet, and you have a bit of that head start going into the first contested territories like redridge, ashenvale, etc.  But its a long run =P
---
I heard a bit about that corpse run as well, dying at sea, but idk I kind of like the added excitement of running through those random places and grabbing the FPs as you go.
---
I feel like most of the people who hate transmog in this thread moreso hate the fact you can go back to old raids in retail and one shot them and transmog the gear no matter how hard it was to get before. So even if I never raided Firelands Heroic, I can go transmog that tier in retail.
---
But that isn't a thing in classic? I see comments all over this thread about how "people who didn't earn it will be able to use it" but you would never be able to transmog, say, T2, if you didn't earn it. This only becomes an issue with expansions being introduced, and could be solved in other ways if demanded (like requirements to mog an item other than "it's in your inventory").
---
The other argument I've seen is that looking at people in endgame gear is motivation to raid. But, if getting the armor or weapon is something difficult, that the player is proud enough of to show it off, they're not going to transmog over it anyway. 
---
I was proud enough to show off my Mythic Nighthold Tier set and my day-one Mage Tower Artifact Appearance in Legion, because they were achievements I was proud of, enough to want to show off. Same for mounts I put a lot of effort into getting, they will always be more special to me than something that looks cool from a previous expansion.
---
**I'm not saying put transmog in classic**, but even if it was, these don't feel like valid arguments against it. The PvP-power level argument is a valid one, but I think it is fixable.*
---
(*IF such a thing was ever implemented into a future version of Classic WoW, perhaps a separate server following an OSRS style. Implement it so if you're pvp flagged, transmog is disabled. Or a better option, let it be disable-able by others. So you see it on your screen, but someone can tick an option to turn it off on their screen so they can see your actual gear. Flagging method leaves the only negative impact on pve servers or in safe areas, but to be fair if you're raiding cities you're not making 1-to-1 judgments on someone's pvp capability. The toggle option would be better as it fits all cases, including the other two arguments that I don't personally find valid.)
---
It's ok, they'll fix it in TBC.
---
What made Molten Core, Black Wing Lair and even Black Rock Spire difficult back then was purely due to lack of information.
---
1. You need to find the key to open Black Rock Spire (Where, How?)
---
2. You need the crystal to open Molten Core or go through Black Rock Depths
---
3. Everyone thought you needed heaps of fire resistance to beat MC (Didn't work out that way :))
---
4. You need to kill all the hounds in a "Hound Pack" at the same time
---
Once you figured out how it all worked it really wasn't that difficult. All that information is now very easy to find. I'll be interested to hear when the first guilds plow through Molten Core and Black Wing Lair :).
---
For me as someone who hasn't played in around 10 years. WoW seems almost professionalized compared to my years in Vanilla (And i thought i we were "Pro" being a guild that had all major raids on farming status). Gaming has also become even more competitive than back then. I can only see the current generation of hardcore gamers smashing their way through Vanilla WoW in record time
---
I'll come back and level a mage as i always wanted a mage, but I won't be getting much epic loot with my 4 hours playtime a week :P. It will be PvP for me i suppose as my end-game content.
---
\~90% of beta testers are not streamers. You just only see streamers playing because they stream it and the rest of us don't.
---
You know exactly what OP is talking about and it's not about guys critiquing the builds of others pushing for world firsts or even seriously raiding.
---
It's the drive-by asshole commentary that used to happen all the time.
---
There's probably a lot going on that can determine what happens. Or I could be wrong. I haven't played since BfA launch, nor was I really paying much attention to these details anymore because it was a lost cause.
---
Ok they said that it will be gone by phase two, which implies it could last much longer than the first couple weeks.
---
Another way it could work is if they went all out. Make *all* gear (or all gear above a certain ilvl) have resistance. Make it like the armor stat in how prevalent it is. Armor *is* pretty much just resistance to physical.
---
Also, I'm a little rusty. How valued was the Stamina stat on dps gear? Trading a small amount of generic defense for a larger amount of specialized defense without impacting dps at all seems like another route they could have taken.
---
Your account is 2 months old. Don't tell me that you hate Diablo 3. Bunch of genius liars out here. Man, you guys should all run for president.
---
this isnt about layering, its when a blizzcon prolly 2015 someone asked for classic servers
---
I am going undead rogue, also will be pushing hard for the blood fang set. It will require a lot of prep/commitment. Gotta get in good raid groups to clear content weekly until phase 3 hits so you have the gear and people to run BWL.
---
Any idea what the extra races would have been?
---
You’re highly overestimating Vanilla raid encounters.
---
Here’s my timeline from back in the day:
---
06/21/06 Naxx released
---
06/24/06 - Razuvious down
---
07/12/06 - anub/noth/faerlina
---
07/14/06 - Maexxna
---
08/09/06 - Heigan
---
08/13/06 - Patchwerk / Grobbulus
---
08/21/06 - Gluth
---
09/10/06 - Thaddius 
---
09/18/06 - Loatheb
---
10/02/06 - Gothik
---
10/23/06 - 4H
---
Most of the pre-Thaddius kills were delayed heavily because we needed to spend the week farming BWL/AQ to gear up players in the revolving door slots. Patchwerk was the gearcheck and Heigan checked whether they could walk and chew gum.
---
"You think we don't, but we do"
---
Excited to phase while flying.
---
The beta is streamers only, and there were 3 full raids on Alliance alone. I was only watching Asmon, so I don’t know what Horde side looked like
---
Transmog never bothered me if I'm honest.
---
There is already changes to classic.
---
You think they'll be done with layering and the server pops will have dropped enough within the first 7 days?
---
there is one dwarf at least on the bottom-left ish
---
Oh I know :)
---
And it doesn't matter if "you proved them wrong"
---
They still make money.
---
They win.
---
Imo tbc is held at far too high a standard.
---
The only thing tbc did better was raids. Those were admittingly amazing (especially kara), but other than that tbc introduced a bunch of the elements that would later ruin the game:
---
\-flying mounts
---
\-group finder
---
\-all classes for both factions. In my opinion they should have added more faction specific classes and not removed the one we had. Making a faction feel more unique would improve the feeling of being part of something special in my opinion. Today playing horde or alliance doesn't matter, picking a race doesn't matter. In fact nothing matters, but it started in tbc.
---
\-multi-faction city making faction choosing even less relevant, since you would hang around each other most of the time anyway
---
\-small dungeons (3-4 bosses each). So even though the dungeons looked different they FELT the same.
---
\-convenient dungeon locations + summoning stones. No more adventure time to get to a dungeon.
---
\-quest hubs. Fun at first, but we all know what this system lead to in the end.
---
\-multiple difficulties for dungeons. So they made the dungeons shorter, but to balance it out you had to clear them more often and in addition to that in heroic modes that were 90% the same. Also we know what this lead to later down the line.
---
\-standartized gear stats and optimized items. Part of vanilla progressions was to finally get to the optimized items for your class. Now your items were almost always optimized and only the numbers changed.
---
There are probably more points, but I already wrote too much god damn it.
---
Great post btw. The illustration pretty much hits the spot perfectly.
---
Luckily I'm old enough that I'm use to waiting. That way I can be fresh and destroy my health on launch.
---
Then they keep it until the end of phase 1
---
we all win
---
I hope this message finds its way to Kala, but as the OP I must clarify:  I am not Kala nor am I in anyway associated with the creation of this video.  I just found it on YouTube and thought others would enjoy it.
---
Hi Played a shadow priest they are most certainly not, a trap. You can easily farm R10 on your own. Sure your epic gear is better but, your still a monster with R10 gear. If you really feel like you need R13 just farm the last couple of ranks as a healer. It will be a bit of an annoyance but, it's not that bad. like I said though. R10+Anathema and, you'll be able to throw punches with the best of them.
---
Also if you cast dispel magic like it's your job. When the time comes you will be invited into premades. People remember the priest who is constantly removing their cc.
---
I lold
---
Normaly the ones ganking lowbies suck so it only takes 1 lvl60 to clear them off not even a problem tbh
---
Even if it's successful the concurrent online population will shrink after a month or so. The first few weeks people are going to be taking time off work and playing nearly 24/7 to rush to 60. After that people will be playing less as the rush slows down and people go back to work.
---
That's not even including people that might just play for a few days and quit when they don't enjoy it as much as BFA or other games.
---
Male Nelf druids were pretty solid, the casting animation for hots/heals was kinda rad.
---
That said, I prefer female nelf animations a lot more.
---
When you saw someone if full tier gear you just knew they were apart of something great. It was something to look up to and to work towards.
---
15 years in and I still have trouble.
---
Transmog is exactly like a MOBA. You select your character or class, and then you select your skin. Without transmog, you're playing an RPG, where the state of your character is reflected in the armour it is showing.
---
Thanks. 
---
As is tradition, all nuance was sacrificed in order to please the meme god.
---
Oh shit haha for sure. I'll guess I should have posted it on they YouTube video 😂 sorry a out that.
---
Names like the ones you listed would never be flagged for a name change. You'll be ok.
---
Who remembers 25man UBRS and 40man BRD attunement raids? Those were the days, im so happy they’re coming back.
---
&gt; \#bringhitbacktolive
---
AMEN! Gearing was way more interesting when you had to balance stats as opposed to picking the just the higher iLvl. That's one thing I love about Vanilla gearing is the hand-picked itemization. Nothing was just a blanket "Main Stat/Stamina/1-2 Secondary" like we have today. Gear is BORING today.
---
You’ll get that, sure, but so long as it’s just comments and it isn’t preventing you from progressing then no biggie.  If it’s consistent harassment, that’s something to report.  But so long as it isn’t your raid lead/officer you shouldn’t have a big problem.  If you do, find a new environment IMO.
---
LOL and magically turn it off " hey guys I know it's been 4 months of phase 1 but here ya go, phase 2 but 12k players on a server. 
---
Must be cool to only think about launch and not what happens after :)
---
Almost as if that's every marketing campaign...
---
Because they want to play and it is unique and interesting.  There has never been another time where the meta cap was lvl30 which is its own unique experience.  What other reasons would someone need though, other than they want to play the game?
---
Who said anything about that?
---
Seems like a 33.33% (repeating of course)  chance of success
---
One does not simply pull a single murloc.
---
I am inviting a cousin and a friend to play, and they already confirmed they will try the game. Those two never played WoW. I also have a friend which told me something similar. I never had the "courage" to invite someone after Wrath.  
---
I have a feeling there will be a good influx of completely fresh players just by word of mouth.
---
You must never have fun at all, then.
---
Shouldve been a raid drop from Ulduar.
---
This is off topic, but your character name reminds me of when a friend in high school tried to get a car license plate that looked like "Ladies' Man", but since it was too many characters, he ended up going with "LADZMAN", which took on a completely different meaning.
---
The big issue with layering is, what do you do if there are massive populations on some servers by the time phase 2 rolls around?
---
It's just going to pack an infinite number of players in to some streamer servers and such, without a clear plan for how to return to a completely non sharded realm.
---
almost 5 hours to get level 10 lmao, thats garbage bro!
---
why do you put effort into trying to speedrun a paladin? the class sucks you'll never get ahead of the pack like a hunter/mage
---
Yea it’ll be longer than a couple weeks but gone by phase 2. That’s fine. It’s rly not that big of a deal
---
I dont disagree with you, MC was a pushover.  BWL we got gear checked at vael then cruised until chromag and once that was on farm, quite easy yes.
---
AQ40 though, phew.  We had to coordinate more, drop more of our carries, and start to really put together a team we could rely ok.  So not easy at all.  We didnt kill CThun until post nerf, but neither did the majority.  
---
Naxx, left 4H, saph, KT on the table, we struggled to find a group capable of being 100% for the 8 tank boss (our strat at the time).  
---
We farmed for hours, wrote in guild forums, devised plans, and either succeeded or failed 100s of times in every raid.  It was never easy
---
I mean while it's possible that's not probable, of course that's dependant on server numbers
---
Not when people rather repost memes about how "popular" classic is instead of asking what happens when phase 1 ends and populations are still 10k+
---
The meta has gone to fury tanking, warriors are still the best tanks around, period. They are the most optimal.
---
Strength vs Style matters again
---
If i remember correctly, a dungeon group should have a tank that is at least 2 levels below the last boss so as to avoid getting crushing blows, if the tank is 3 levels or below the last boss crushing blows will almost 1 shot them most likely resulting in a wipe.
---
So at the bare minimum an rfc group should have be around lvl 14 ( although 13 works but 14 gives access to higher spell upgrades which is a massive boost at that level) and a tank is usually required to be the highest level in the group to minimize crushing blow , 16 is optimal but 15 works fine , 14 you'll be tempting fate and below that level I don't see your group killing the last boss unless you use some strat to avoid taking damage from the boss somehow, if your healer spam heals the tank to keep him alive they'll go oom in 5 secs and if they don't they'll probably end up pulling aggro and dying resulting in a wipe anyway.
---
There's also the Shaman option. Elemental Shaman is a ridiculously good combo with a Warrior. 
---
Would require rolling horde though, and Orc/Troll as races if you want to quest together from level 1.
---
TO BE FAIR, a beta test (a stress test no less) would still fall under the "YOU THINK YOU DO" phase of his comment. I know he gets a lot of shit for that comment (and it was a shitty comment), but he TECHNICALLY hasn't been proven wrong *yet*.
---
At this point in Classic's life-cycle, people would still think this is the game they want (i.e., they haven't experienced it fully yet). If people start bailing in droves because of lack of QoL and LFR/LFD and other retail stuff... then he can say the "BUT YOU DON'T" prophecy has been fulfilled. When thousands and thousands of people are still playing Classic 2+ years from now... we can demand his resignation. ;)
---
Personally I think that in organized battleground pvp alliance is superior because paladins are overpowered relative to shamans.
---
Blessing of protection, freedom , bubble, concentration aura, good mana pool, fast heals, plate,  can cleanse.
---
Hi blizzard employee.
---
1. You don't need tank talents to tank while leveling. There's life outside dungeons and you want to be useful there.
---
2. Thunderclap blows in vanilla. 
---
Keep asking if you want.
---
Yes, but it's BoE.
---
I wish lol
---
I think we had 8 rogues in the raid for this video. I'm the sexy night elf warrior in Wrath shoulders. As first offtank I died shortly after the boss from Burning Adrenaline.
---
Bonus footage of our clicker resto druid from the first (and only?) Loatheb kill. I think our best attempt was maybe mid 20s until we came back with full world buffs. 
---

---
Great tip!
---
ligma
---
Holy... shit. How is this even work. And more interesting - why it is not working in retail.
---
No, it really isn't, even on Alliance with Paladins to buff your holy damage.
---
See you in Stranglethorn, beast.
---
Danger noodle skadoodle
---
There’s no shadowcloak for rogues in vanilla
---
Eh, it was already surmised that bosses had &gt;10% parry in classic.  We knew this because when Expertise came out  it was known, and this is how the 'soft expertise' cap worked; to cap on dodge.  Then since more expertise only gave anti-parry, it was less valuable than say ArmorPen or Haste (depending on your tank class).
---
If your PServer had 5% boss parry, that is just egregious.
---
1. As I said, Esfand did not put his Paladin together very well. A well prepared retribution deals so much more. Again, I can't stress enough that a retribution's DPS is a bit odd, given that they deal so much little damage through weapon procs, trinket procs, enchant procs and consecration.
---
2. Keep in mind that he only used a few consumables, used rank2 consecration only (he didn't use exorcism, because the dummy is a mechanical target), and had no other buffs from other classes. That DPS can skyrocket up to 900 and above. Again, keep in mind, it's the damage dealt that matters...
---
3. You can see the damage dealt. He could literally crit the boss once with other weapon procs and AFK out with 1.3k DPS in the end. The server was NostalGeek, where Judgment of Command didn't work half of the time. He is very much equaling other rogues and warriors, and reaching up to mages (the damage meter is a bit off due to ignite bug, where all the damage is credited to one mage only).
---
4. Obviously. Right?
---
5. There are classes / specs that Will outperform some others due to itemization / how the classes work. Why is it that Hunters are pretty much top DPS in Molten Core? wHeRe ArE tHe WaRrIoRs AnD rOgUeS? And again, I can't stress enough: damage dealt is what matters.
---
Diablo 3 and Wow after hit were removed are some of the worst least inspired itemization schemes ever invented.
---
Especially when you look at wow gearing prior to reforging and Diablo 2. How did the followups so definitively miss the mark?
---
The other side of it though Is that it's a magic world where we can disguise ourselves into entirely different races. The logic and co sistency is there for transmog. And it's still cool to see well thought transmog and people transmogged in unique armors of the time. Particularly pvp. If you could mog sulfuras it's still be a cool thing to see.
---
Also immersion has more than one side. Transmog let's you break the chains of the story. Perhaps you make the blue sword from duskwoods your in lore weapon. The game will hold you back from doing that because eventually you'll have to replace it because its stats are the most important part, not the actual weapon. Transmog gave your character more definition, made it more unique in a game that otherwise has limited character customization. That's just the otherside of it.
---
But ultimately it's a matter of taste and I see the appeal on both ends. I lean more towards transmog though because in the current age of knowledge at our fingertips theres not much wonder about what someone's wearing. No mystery. It's kinda the shitty thing about modern games, we know almost anything there is to k ow about a game at any time. 
---
I wouldn't mind if retail made it so you can ignore peoples transmog if you want to play with it off. That should be an option too for folks like you.
---
&gt;maybe it's due to the character creation UI.
---
This is most likely why. Vanilla WoW might as well have been held together by duct tape and prayer in a lot of places!
---
Opposite experience with me, I wanna go alliance, literally all my friends wanna go horde, sigh. \*lok'tar ogars unenthusiastically\*
---
Bad Manners.
---
I might be interested, ally or horde ?
---
I can't seem to get questie to work. Any instructions you could give?
---
Classic isn't retail.
---
Retail people stop after a month because once you get through everything, which isn't hard to do unless you're trying to do mythic raiding, there's nothing relevant left to do.  That can happen in weeks in retail.
---
In classic the character arch is the whole lifetime.  MC never really becomes completely irrelevant, for example, the way a previous tier becomes irrelevant in retail.
---
The character arch is so long that I think people will play more and longer than they do retail.
---
I get that if you look at it from an RP perspective it makes sense to slow down the other faction to make them weaker overall, but I doubt most gankers/griefers think of it that way. I think they just want to annoy and frustrate people - which makes the think they're younger kids/teens to be completely honest xD
---
I think of it as, especially if I'm on the faction with greater numbers, if I want good and fun competitive engagements at max level it is in my own best interest to leave them be so I can farm them when they're max level ;)
---
And not only that, while I wait I can farm gold, gear and honor to prepare more.
---
However, this does not apply to people that are ranking and killing level 52+ lowbies while they're in queue. That at least makes sense. Sure it's annoying to get interrupted while you're grinding, but I get why they have to do it xD
---
That’s pretty bad, I feel like 1-5 exploration is alright but it slows down so much after that I feel like it’s just not worth
---
I remember... it was right then, because Vikund is me!
---
This is an alternative leveling method if the starter zones are so packed that tagging mobs becomes near impossible. Look at videos from the stress test yesterday. If the launch is anything like that, exploration leveling will be much faster than standard questing at first.
---
Kill the gnome, drink with the dwarf. I like it!
---
&gt; Naga, forsaken, and blood elves.
---
I would probably swap the Forsaken for the Broken Drainei as they were allied with BElves in War 3.
---
Forsaken could have been its own faction with Forsaken Humans, Elves and abomination type creatures.
---
NElf faction could maybe have had Ursas and Dryads as additional races but as you said that would be way to many factions.
---
Sounds like you just don’t want to compete for the best item in the game.
---
Oh hey boys we found another catakid!
---
That has no way of thinking past his nose.
---
Nobody should be buying their epic mount before Phase 2 anyway, unless they have an obscene amount of gold. Get PVP rank 4 (I think it's 4) for an extra 10% faction discount. That's another 100g of the cost of your mount.
---
yup, used to make a lot of friends that way
---
you manage to list the expac i played the least, congrats
---
A lot of people would only be able to do it on a rogue, or not at all. Skilled PvPers can analyze what they see faster, and should not have that ruined by transmog.
---
&gt; stupid argument
---
If you had any good arguments you wouldn't need to resort to insults.
---
I remember reading about this in John Staats's WoW Diary. That book's absolutely worth the read, by the way.
---
Me and some buddies are doing something similar.  We all took that first week off and are going to crew up at a friends house for a couple days to LAN it up.  We're all \~30 years old, so in my mind this is great timing for classic to come out; any later and people will be married / have kids and wouldn't be able to devote as much time.  
---
SO.  FREAKING.  EXCITED.
---
This makes me want to drop my orc rogue in favor of a troll purely because of that kick! 
---
Still, I like spartan kicks
---
Tbc classes &gt; vanilla classes.
---
Spell batching is a mess. It’s in everything in the game not just the combat system. It doesn’t matter if you’re looting a mob or opening your mail, everything feels like it’s being done with 500ms.
---
If you liked community and world pvp, then vanilla is infinitely better than TBC. TBC had better raids, that's it. Flying mounts and off-world expansions are a plague to WoW to this day.
---
I recommend not playing vanilla and just wait for TBC servers.
---
Considering this sub is now 120k and growing, I would be straight up shocked if retail didn't have at least 1 million at launch.   And given how NA dominant reddit is, I wouldn't be surprised if we hit multiple millions as well.
---
I may level that way
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER
---
Thank you! I'm very excited.
---
You don't need tailoring to wear the Bloodvine set.
---
Yeah, There's a ton of XP in Teldrassil, but the time to get there and get it is just cumbersome. Working on some new ideas, but I still like the chill aspect of the run.
---
Really? I've taken this test a few times, and I'm always borderline INTJ and ENTJ. But if it ever comes up in conversation, I'll usually say ENTJ regardless because the INJT description sounds like a snobby, reclusive 4chan type.
---
Do you think its because of the perceived rarity or websites like 16personalities using descriptions like this:
---
&gt; "...it is often a challenge for them to find like-minded individuals who are able to keep up with their relentless intellectualism and chess-like maneuvering."
---
They've specifically said it's meant to address the large populations cohabiting what will be a handful of zones at launch.  That stresses the servers like crazy so it's either sharding/layering or open a ton of realms.  
---
Once things have settled a little bit, say a month in, people will be far more spread out in the world so presumably the load on the servers will be less.  By that point they can turn it off and they're left with large yet stable servers, instead of segmented ones.  That's how I understand it, personally I agree with the approach but if their intentions are different than I can't speak to that.
---
Oh cool. I’m around 20-21 minutes with my Pally 😊
---
Retail is like what, 1.5m?  Shouldn't be that hard to surpass.
---
That's fair. I forgot his reply was to a single individual (which makes it even shittier). However, I think he was answering for the entire community. It was just a smarmy way of saying what tons of people have already said: you can't go back, it's just nostalgia, it won't be as good as you remembered, etc.
---
And I should mention, I think he was wrong and I am super-duper PUMPED to play Classic. :D
---
For the Horse ...Thud and Blunder!
---
I'm a vanilla baby but I agree with their opinion that TBC was more fun. I personally liked it more but wasn't much of a PvPer until wotlk.
---
Don't get me started on "those people"
---
Your first two sentences don't support your third one. Are you suggesting the only people playing Vanilla are people who still play retail? If you are, you couldn't be more off base.
---
I quit WoW and it was the only MMORPG I played for more than a few days, as is the case for many others. After all the time I spent on WoW, I wasn't about to go learn another less interesting MMO.
---
Now they're giving us the opportunity to go back to when it was more fun. If you think people playing classic are part of some niche community, you're wrong. There are tons of former wow players out there interested in vanilla. It's like a new expansion except you already know that it's good.
---
Some mounts were race locked in Vanilla, maybe Naga just get chariots.
---
About very long hair in mmos, i think you are right about this, hair clipping must be the #1 factor .
---
Regarding shoulder length hair for male humans, i think its how pop culture shaped male fantasy characters' looks in mainstream media and as an extend to our minds, from some older fantasy movies or cartoons to Conan, Hercules, and finally LotR and GoT recently. Just a guess, i am not a pop culture expert or anything.
---
I could totally see how that would ruin your immersion. When I transmog my Gnome I'm always thinking about the stories of his father, Basmon the troll mage.
---
Really depends on server launch congestion. During the stress test, the quests around 5-10 were insanely crowded and some (getting the candles and gold dust for example) were near impossible to do in a timely manner.  
---
It's good to have alternatives, and if he can get it down to 3:30 including all those flight paths then that's pretty good for a crowded launch.
---
I always loved casting immolate after agony/corruption with my UD male warlock.
---
First you corrupt your enemy with the offensive animation and then proceed to cast the immolate.  Your character's hands end up in the air after the immolate while your enemy is set on fire from the ground.
---
I just really dig that shit.
---
why so negative?
---
Got a link for that map? lol
---
I notice he didn't link anything also lmao. Also him saying  "turns out you do want that"  isn't him saying he is wrong.
---
Ligma
---
I dislike being able to hide cloak and helm. Tabards I don't mind. Call me inconsistent if you will.
---
oh looked it up
---
ok makes sense now lol
---
That's what we're doing too! I'm 21 at the moment and my best friend lives with me and my dads house. Everyone's gonna come over with their rigs crash for a few nights then dip. back when I was 13-14 during the end of cata and beginning of Mists we had groups of 6 us over to my parents house and we would LAN play Warcraft 3. Some of my favorite memories of my freshman year were staying up late on a Friday night spending hours on WC3, and then afterwards playing Retail with everyone.
---
# Ligma
---
Rogue is the most played class in the game isn’t it?
---
So I guess my question is whats the cost effeiceny of grinding tailoring for bloodvine vs. Buying it outright?
---
I never reached endgame as a kid. BC cameout first.
---
Yep I miss this
---
they've said it wouldn't be permanent and at most would end on phase 1, I get that blizzard is distrusted by a decent amount of people but that's what they've said
---
tbc launch was wack af where I played, 2 straight weeks of constant rollbacks and many a couple of more with plenty of DCs
---
id rather play the game, I don't pay a sub to wait on a queue
---
Honestly the Male NE looks like a Muay Thai cut kick.   
---
Although, like you'll constantly hear from any good Kru...  
---
HE SHOULD KEEP HIS FUCKING HANDS UP!
---
Cata.
---
Ive played on launch day of private servers for years.. its nothing new to me.. plus once you get past the first 10-15 levels it isnt so bad.
---
This was me last week when I saw the stress test option on my launcher and logged in to the server being offline lol
---
My favourites are Wailing Caverns and Scarlet Monastery.
---
My worst are DM, Gnomer and RFK
---
Nope, sorry. The new parry values take care of that. Bears are tougher than fury tanks and put up the same TPS. Warriors in pre-raid BiS and T1 are too fragile to fury tank anyway and ferals outperform deep prot warriors so warriors won't even be competing until BWL or later. GG
---
T2 pally set wants a word my friend. 
---
Other than that, absolutely.
---
Unless the streamers keep their chosen realm/faction a secret until launch day, which many intend to do.
---
You could still see people wearing current mythic gear before bfa tho. And when mage tower came out that was very cool too. And mop had challenge mode gear. Honestly its rly just bfa that dropped the ball with no tier sets so theres nothing at end game that even feels special.
---
or horde (i think)
---
Then it's a gamble baby!!!!!
---
i like my Orc Sparta kick.
---
For something that's only used as an interrupt most of these would take too long to execute and recover from to fulfill the purpose...
---
Im leveling as enhance and swapping to resto .
---
People need to stop parroting this horseshit as evidence of anything.
---
If you are relating this to retail betas vs retail I understand where you are coming from. 
---
This is really common behavior today in p servers. Everybody helping out each other, just like in vanilla.
---
It was the best expansion, but thats like saying it was the tallest midget. At least compared to 7'5 Shaq(vanilla)
---
There are multiple IT experts out there, explaining the difference to people that are clueless (like me and obviously you).
---
From what I know since I tried to dig a little deeper sharding and layering are not just - not the same- they aren’t even close.
---
So calm down and read a bit and give them a fair Chance not to fuck this up.
---
They know we don’t want sharding. Now it’s their turn to sell us layering.
---
Consider  warcraft 3
---
That's me right now, they like the Alliance zones and races better.
---
Stress test realm is linked with the beta realms and people are creating 19 twinks.
---
Me on Blizzard forums requesting them as a playable race  .
---
Starts thread titled NAGA PLEASE!
---
I am now banned .
---
Some people like to do early leveling by questing in the zone they want a mount from. You could get some troll rep that way.
---
Sure, buddy.
---
What are you even *talking* about? BRD is a 5-man. If you're farming, you're likely doing it with a guild, or you're using PuGs where nobody else in the group could possibly need it. Why would you even form groups where two people want the same rare item? That's just laughably inefficient. Even if I wanted an Ironfoe, I'd most assuredly be doing it without any interest overlap in my group makeups.
---
You are ready for those BG losses
---
I don't think the metaphor is gaps as in game design, but as in fixed code.  Vanilla had a lot of functional hacks and exploits that won't be in classic.  Not to mention server stability in vanilla being really shit.
---
&gt; Also if you cast dispel magic like it's your job.
---
You suppose OP is envisioning spam-clicking decursive in his shadow priest fantasy?
---
There's nothing wrong with my love for you~
---
I think he meant Stoneform is basically CloS in Vanilla.
---
you think its horseshit, but its not
---
Nowadays I always assume any low level is someone's alt. So I never give them free stuff. I'll help though.
---
I guess technically that works, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Naga to slither really really fast on dry land.
---
kek, no.
---
Also divine favor shock is enough, you never 1v1.
---
I don't believe it's BiS without the bonus you get with it from Tailoring though.
---
I freaking miss arrow quivers.
---
Lol we will see. But basing it on a stress test is asinine. I swear this entire subreddit is one big circle jerk sometimes
---
That would require rolling horde which I would do if they weren’t so ugly... :(
---
I only know from my Female Tauren Paladin on retail that their animation is backhand slapping their opponents because I nearly fell over laughing the first time I kicked a mob while leveling.
---
Only thing I want is to be able to turn on modern models for myself. The rest can stay thr same but no ones nostalgia will be ruined by my character looking better on my screen alone.
---
They shouldve gotten rid of gnome warrior and left human hunters.  If tauren cant be rogues because they are to big then gnomes shouldnt be warriors because they are to small
---
I mean it is accurate for most of these people. They will drop the game as the hype goes down or as the grind becomes too much. If you played the pservers and add friends as you level you noticed barely any of them make it to level 60.
---
Wow should never ever xpac and reset. If I were blizzard, I would realease content updates and keep everyone 60. You can add more zones if you'd like but tie them into original story lines. Keep the same ore, maybe add more to crafting. So add copper, iron, and mithril + the new ore to make new items on xpac. Discovered a friendly race of Naga? New zone now adds the Naga faction tying into other zones story lines now level 1-60 with new story lines...etc. it keeps everything relevant.
---
It's going to be hard to do RFC as alliance again lol.
---
Bro I played a shadow priest. Clicking dispel magic on your warrior friend and watching him sail into your enemies is one of the best parts. Dispel magic is a priests best spell. Any form of priest. If you aren't casting it commonly. Play a warlock you don't belong here.
---
&gt;to feel like they are playing the bad guys
---
Jokes on them, then.  If you read the quest text for both factions, it's pretty clear horde are the good guys in the game, at least in vanilla.
---
So you're saying that in an actual living world, you could never change your clothes or have them custom-tailored to your preference?
---
One of the biggest differences from vanilla I've noticed since returning to WoW. Vanilla had WAAAY more gnomes than retail/Classic.
---
I remember the run when I first started, had a friend who could play during the first days and got me into it. Couple weeks later. He came and got me in darny. It was an epic run. Loved it!
---
That's not be saying that I don't want to do "no work that a vanilla gm does" lmao. Thats saying I don't have time to stop on whim to get things out of a gbank for someone. If an officer had privs to do it then they could. If not... Whatever they will wait.
---
When I look at the NE male, I hear my Kru yelling at me to keep my hands up...
---
Only nerds read quest text.
---
Same here. And I'd love to play on a PvP server but they all want to play on a PvE server except one friend.
---
You're literally the only one in this thread who got it, lmao
---
Hence the quotes. It was just a fast kill for us at the time.
---
I'm just responding to your statement that "Far more people have quit wow than play wow". You can't use that ratio to determine exactly how popular Classic will be since you can't know the numbers of how many of those former players have quit the genre, or even computer gaming, completely.
---
* I should have said "many" rather than "most" in my comment since most implies a majority.
---
I enjoyed both games thoroughly. TBC was just much more enjoyable. Better raids. Better zones. Better PvP. Better professions. Better everything.
---
&gt;Or I can be your guild bank, sent everything to me. Np.
---
Problem solved!
---
I would be so on board with a new game that is built on the spirit of Vanilla. my dream is World of Diablo, but neither of those things will ever happen.
---
No but wait we are 90 days out and still have no layering exploit solution!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Plenty of time to not fix it, have dullies constantly retort " it's only beta / stress test"
---
I might be a dick, but I downrank fort buffs to pay people back when they throw a buff on me.
---
Fort gets so expensive past 30... Like half of my mana pool at level 50. They're not going to notice the 10 stam difference between ranks 4 and 5, but it's a fraction of the mana.
---
I also do the same thing in dungeons, only casting the highest rank on the tank. No one else has ever noticed or complained, and I just don't wanna sit and drink twice to buff everyone when they shouldn't be getting hit in the first place.
---
But at the same time I cast PW:F on lowbies even though I have to go into my spellbook to get out the lower ranks since they are too low, so hopefully that counts for something.
---
For pve it doesn’t matter at all. 5% extra intellect is nothing even in Naxx gear. The Human diplomacy racial is more valuable for the many rep grinds in vanilla.
---
For pvp it does matter. The escape artist racial is borderline broken. While the human perception racial is utterly useless.
---
For some reason when I read this, I was thinking like he wanted a bunch of Naga to race from Zoram Strand to Azshara or something, lol...
---
You can keep saying that as much as you want, but you obviously never seen well put together and good retribution.
---
one time the gate bugged on a server that can't be named and the tank tried to show us how to jump over it. two dps and the healer had already left bc they didn't want to bother it, but the tank stayed for like 10 minutes until i got the hang of the jump lol, his patience was extraordinary and i'm grateful for that
---
ITS 32.33% NOOB
---
Isn't it a recycled track from undead in wc3
---
I don't think what you're implying has become clear at all.
---
I went the other way. I was angsty and wanted to be a troll cannibal, and an undead zombie. I was a PVP fanatic. 
---
I settled down as I got older, and like the aesthetic of big bearded, big armed dwarves. As well as citys that are structurally sound. I can't imagine what sort of idiot thinks its a good idea to have giant spikes laying around. Some one's gonna poke thier eye out!
---
Bye Felicia!
---
Then you have to be horde. I considered it just don’t think they are good looking.
---
Nice idea! However I have a plan for zones and will be using the quest guide/questie to power level. I booked the first week off and need to capitalize hard on that lol. Been slowly leveling on a p server just to enjoy the leveling without the add ons.
---
For me, the worst thing about transmog is that it is fake. The game world isn't shown the way it really is. The character is holding weapon A, but it looks like weapon B.
---
The game world shouldn't be represented in a fake way.
---
I have seen everything, even prot pala main tank. Playing this for over a decade.
---
I don't want to see this in classic. I want the game to feel as close to how it once was.
---
I have spent countless hours researching Vanilla mechanics and the 14% number comes up nowhere.
---
My guess is that it might have been changed at some point during the later patches.
---
I know that 14% is correct, because I verified it based on some old Vanilla raid logs, but every bit of information that I have read, says its 5.6%.
---
That seems far from worth it considering you're just going to use swords once you hit ten anyway.
---
I imagine putting armor on a naga was likely the problem which they didn't include it.  Pants and boots just don't make sense.
---
Shit, I'd play the hell out of a naga race though :(
---
Oh really? I have heard so much about /sit macros lately I figured it was going to be something to look out for
---
That's fair enough. Good for you, even :)
---
Hey, did it work? If it did, can u share some data?
---
The dorf has fear ward... which should be consumed and isn't. But I don't think it has to do with sit. IDK though
---
Priest can get away with disc/holy builds as long as they have wand spec/spirit tap, but the other 3 specs gain very little damage/sustain from their healing trees.  Paladins can maybe justify 11 holy especially if they are interested in tanking while leveling, but shamans/druids get so little value for leveling by specing restoration...
---
It's actually a really easy fix though.
---
Getting the patterns isn't difficult or expensive. Any raiding tailor will have them eventually just by running ZG. It's the 11 Mooncloth that's going to be rough. It'll take one tailor 42 days to make all the Mooncloth for one full set. But you're not *saving* money by doing this yourself, because whatever you buy the Mooncloth for, you could have sold yours for the same price and a gathering profession will make back the money in any case. My recommendation would be to start buying it up when BWL hits. Mages don't need Mooncloth and most Priests will have their Truefaith Vestments by then. Important to note: you'll be missing out on the 2% crit set bonus by not being a tailor, but I'm not sure that makes it worth it.
---
We have been doing testing on the Classic beta to back it up. 
---
Here's the data:
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5
---
Yeah not worth at all haha. Swords is the fastest leveling so daggers are for post 60 with some gear!
---
I didn't realize that thing was from Vanilla, given that Stormwind got a complete facelift after Cata.
---
Understood. I just meant to say there is a large pool of former wow players. Even if only ~5-10% of them come back, that number alone is likely more than what retail currently has
---
Looks like the set bonus is locked behind tailoring 300?
---
Exploration is a meme. Just group up for quests in the starting area. Absolute worst case scenario, you can get to level 3 and grind the level 5-6 mobs outside.
---
So was this possible in 2006 or just a beta thing?
---
You could agree to park your characters all at  same level. If someone wants to play the game when nobody is around they can run an alt.  Maybe a warlock for purpose of camping it somewhere to portal the group in.
---
Most of this is based on old vanilla stigmas that don't really have much relevance nowadays. You won't find many Ret Paladins or Enhancement Shamans in premades after all and virtually everyone will pick Engineering and grind PvP items and trinkets. People have significantly improved, is my point. Classic is vanilla in design, not in meta. Do Horde have great PvP racials? Undoubtedly. Orc hardiness is globally applicable against every class (even those without stuns due to engineering bombs and Tidal Charm usage). WOTF is often rated very highly for the obvious swing value against Warlocks and Priests. But then people know that these days, and as a result the amount of Alliance Warlocks is a good bit lower which in turn devalues WOTF. 
---
Meanwhile, people definitely aren't sleeping on Alliance racials these days either. Shadowmeld can be fantastic, especially for Hunters. Stoneform is incredibly strong and Escape Artist can change entire matchups. The only poor racials here are Human which are quite often picked due to classes and visuals, whereas Horde's worst PvP racials are Troll which are underpopulated generally. 
---
That said are we talking WPvP or premades here? WPvP it ultimately is going to come down mainly to individual skill and server population, assuming you'll have about 50/50 it won't matter much. An Alliance rogue will have a tougher time due to hardiness, an Alliance warlock will have a tougher time to due WOTF. Meanwhile, Alliance gnome warriors have a much better time in general. 
---
Paladins and Shamans are the biggest element, especially in premades. If you'll have issue with one of these in WPvP comes down more to individual classes, but in premades it does have larger impact. Alliance will have much more access to cleanses and defensive abilities, which in turn makes Horde Warlocks far less effective for instance. Meanwhile, Horde has more burst potential since all shamans go Elemental Shaman. 
---
Either way, just pick whichever faction you prefer it's going to come down to how your server turns out to be (and even less so if they go with cross-realm BGs which I believe they said they're considering for better or worse).
---
I believe that was the level, yes.
---
I have 9 links (including original vanilla forums) about how +HIT and +Weapon Skill works.
---
Most of them contradicts each other.
---
The only thing we know is that we know nothing :o
---
It felt like they used all their time and effort to create the starting area and forgot about the rest.
---
The Priest of Mitra was fun, but I remember being so pissed because Bear Shamans just rolled me.
---
Christ, you TBC people really piss me off sometimes. Literally everything except raids was better. 
---
WoW vanilla had the best ever Map in history of gaming. Nothing like it is close. It's 2 massive continents split that took nearly 10 years to make, there are many zones and all of them are unique. Are you seriously comparing Outland to Vanilla map?  Nothing in the history of gaming is comparable to vanilla WoW 2 continent map, let alone some shitty expansion map like Outland. 
---
And secondly, Outland zones were butt ugly. Blizz devs even made an internal meme about it since it was to dark and depressing and said that Nagrand was the only zone in Outland they found players found great. Goddamn I hate TBC babies. 
---
On PvP . . if you liked instanced PvP then TBC was better with addition of arenas. If you liked World PvP than vanilla is infinitely superior in every way, and that is not even including flying mounts into the picture. 
---
I can't comment on TBC professions or raiding much, I know that TBC raiding was better but professions were likely tied with vanilla, from my few months in retail TBC it was essentially just upgraded flasks/items from vanilla style.
---
Nice strawman.
---
I'm not trashing classic. I'm pointing out that the sense of vindication in the thread is out of proportion for an unreleased game and that the reality is much closer to something in the middle.
---
For some people it actually is a case of "they DO want it". But for most people riding the hype train what brack said totally applies. We cant go off a streamer event, or an echo chamber on reddit. We shit on a guy who's certainly right for the majority of wows current playerbase.
---
the scarlet monastery [event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3E6W6-rRGA) it triggers is pretty cool too
---
Warlock/paladin, mage/mage, druid warlock are theoretically the strongest right now.
---
Shaman warrior is wicked once you get WF totem.
---
Wasn't there an ungodly amount of content cut from the original release of World of Warcraft?
---
Like Outlands, Emerald Dream, Death Knights, a million different skills/abilities, Northrend, bunch of BGs and dungeons, things like that?
---
I know Hayven (May God rest his soul) made a ton of videos about early alpha WoW things that were cut
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjVDQloX4cIpGqpM6mdyD2Q/videos
---
Good luck to you :)
---
I don't think you could really mess with the current content much. I think if they did any kind of expansion, I don't think you could really add new areas with gear that trivialize the current raids. I think all you could really do is add new raids that have slightly higher gear, but you would need to do a lot of the previous raids to have the gear to do the new ones added, so probably very few people could really get to it
---
Even if bosses damages were buffed by 20% to 30%, the tanks wouldn't die. I say that based on experience.
---
Healers have no mana problems whatsoever, because the fights are so short and they can just use mana potions/flasks.
---
The nerf to TPS will be noticeable on the horde side, but on alliance side there shouldn't be any problems with threat due to salvation.
---
Also, there's a video of Monkeynews dual-wield tanking Nefarian back in the day, so yes, we will keep doing it in Classic.
---
&gt;Only nerds read quest text.
---
Says the guy posting on the classic wow sub :)
---
I've tried that on a few launches. Slower than exploration, to 5 at least.
---
Meaningless question. Depends on the server.
---
Also, Alliance isn't "superior in PvE" because of humans. It's because of Paladins and their Blessing of Salvation (and to a lesser degree, Fear Ward Dwarf Priests).
---
I don't have beta access but I have stress test access. 
---
I'll make an undead now and confirm it for you.
---
EDIT: https://imgur.com/a/qKzPMRZ Confirmed. It plays the correct music track.
---
Welcome home!
---
What, not a fan of decorative bones? What about metal spikes? Still not happy? Have you tried bones?
---
It was better than his shitty death as a dungeon boss.
---
And dont forget to dodge
---
Yea a beast faction would have been awesome. We need to make a petition for the first major Classic expansion to be a beast faction.
---
I vote for
---
Nagas
---
Murlocs
---
Werewolves
---
Dragonkin
---
That's a shit experience. There is NO justifying that logic. In classic it took dedicated players weeks to get to 60, it's not a simple decision to reroll.
---
This is exactly the ignorance that astounds me. How can you want wow classic to succeed and want all the worse parts of it back like its 2004. We have better server technology, they should make use of it! Or are you also going to buy a 2004 era Dell desktop to play the game "as it should be".
---
There should be a daily thread for this at that point, like there is a weekly thread for "what class should i play".
---
We will see.
---
This subreddit is an echochamber in that it represents an very small portion of the people who will both try classic wow in August and keep playing for a relatively long time. It's the same thing with other game-related subreddits, where the average user there who posts/comments on the subreddit is more likely to be invested in the game. This is basic. People know this, but it's worth reiterating.
---
The stress test looks like it was adequately stressed, yeah. There are a lot of people there, and that's just one area! Classic is being very hyped up. The same can be said for every retail expansion, and yet those drop players.
---
Just don't be surprised when "You think you do, but you don't" is true for a *lot* of people who try out classic, whether it's with their existing retail subscription or new players who want to try out wow classic. If it doesn't apply to you, that's great! I genuinely hope you have a nice time playing it. 
---
Just know that the saying will apply to many people. So we will see.
---
That there is a defensive instinct 2. I never claimed any of it, but if you can just paint it like i did you can invalidate my opinion and prevent reconsidering your own (our opinions are often  something we care deeply for) - one you don't want to hear. Studying psychology, perhaps its showing xD Eh i'll lay off, we're only human. Glhf m8, see you in classic!
---
I always wish I will get invited to betas and then never participate when I actually do get invited anyway, haha.
---
Thank you and good luck to you as well! A week of 16 hour days with a guide and I hope I will get close to 60 at least haha.
---
probably back then too since i doubt they change anything on the maps

Chris, its Na-gonna happen.

I found a repo with textures converted to PNG, it's a bit mixed up but each folder is marked with the respective WoW version: https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-textures/tree/classic
---
Im gonna start a human warlock and level in teldrassil early for darnassus rep with no warlock trainer in Kalimdor. The hell itself but the only horse I'd sit on is the dreadsteed which wont be out for months. Idk about ppl saying p1 will only last 2 months, I honestly expect a longer p1...
---
that made me laugh! 
---
ULTIMATE POOOOOWER
---
BfA doesn’t work that way because this is entirely new server tech created for Classic WoW. 
---
Are you actually this way in reality or are you being intentionally obtuse?
---
It's certainly closer. How hard is it to admit to making a mistake? It's liberating really. I was looking over my post history and I've done it twice in the last 2 weeks.

That's the nerdiest sentence I've ever seen

Remind me again when pre max level content was considered 'a big part of the game' after ratings were introduced?
---
Hate modern wow all you like, but powergrowth hasnt been a thing during leveling for over a decade. And further, powergrowth was real during leveling for 99% of the wow population during the first leveling content after ratings were introduced. Most people were finding upgrades in HFP or Zangar. Only the folks in T3 werent finding upgrades and were getting weaker as they approached 70.
---
Same for today, if you level from 1-max you feel power increases as you level. Only those geared out from the previous expansion lose their power.
---
If you're truly upset that rating was the solution to stop old gear from being relevant, then youre blind to the larger picture. As for 99.9% of any given expansion youre sitting at max level where rating to % conversions are static.
---
Wow since the end of classic has been a game designed around the max level endgame. Dont like it dont play. But rating was a good solution to the problem at hand. And rating was not the driver of the switch from a holistic leveling and max level experience to primarilly one aimed at the endgame it was mearly a feature that helped implement the design decisions.
---
Learn to have a debate without personal attacks, it really devalues the substance of your arguments.
---
Oh right, it was Lupos they gutted :s
---
He was so good with that shadow damage
---
For me it's because I can better switch my point of view and it makes more sense for my desk real estate
---
Vanilla has the most "complete" world and is the most immersive, imo
---
with the addition of Outlands in BC, much of the world became irrelevant.  And once you got your flying mount, the world became a lot smaller.  There was some great end-game content in BC and some really nice QoL changes, but overall it felt a lot less epic in scale.
---
WotLK had some of the same problems, although I think that Northrend was more diverse than outland.  WotLK had arguably the best QoL changes (dual spec, achievements, dailies, etc) but the leveling was easier and grindier - you could easily solo groups of 5 or 6 mobs, but getting from 70 - 80 took a long time.  Again, it had some great end-game content, but the general milieu was less engrossing, imo.
---
Was leveling a toon on retail this weekend, and while running through Hellfire, I found two traveler's backpacks. 
---
Got really excited until I realized I had 4 30 slot bags on already. 
---
Getting one in Classic is going to feel amazing.
---
I sang this... Thanks
---
Yea I understand for that but if you’re gaming for hours you want to be looking straight on.
---
Well clearly they don't want to overload the server with too many chat messages.
---
Lmfao you haven't even played TBC??? You are such a fuck for arguing this.
---
S8? Seriously? That shit was a joke. If thats your metric for good pvp then any other season must have been like drilling rusty nails into your brain. Or rose tinted glasses, idk
---
Not sure about this particular one, but I have seen and done similar wall jumps during Vanilla.
---
This is the only way, my friend.
---
&gt;The purpose of this post is to create some conversation and also to help me understand which way the community is leaning.
---
You and the past 5000 other people who've posted this topic every few hours every day for the past few months.
---
My opinion is that none of this fucking matters. The game isn't even out yet, and this is the quintessential cart-before-the-horse mentality. Let's stop speculating about stuff that won't happen, if at all, for several years.
---
Youre thinking about this too much. Just have fun
---
If someone puts a buff on me I return the favor every time, even if i have to chase after them.
---
Hmmmm.... I know those tiny % are what seperate the guys who go raiding with the hardcore crowd and who don't. But I think the dps boosts off engie is considered more important for the hardcore raiding scenes. I know it matters more for PvP.
---
Do you understand that this a stress test of the beta, specifically for testing this new functionality? 
---
It looks to have the same issues as retail because it’s a BUG. Layering is literally supposed to do the opposite of this.
---
I want TBC and Wrath. But who knows, the population could be so dead in 2-3 years that Blizzard doesn't do anything because it's not economical.
---
The problem with slightly higher gear is that after a few raids, it's no longer slightly more powerful.
---
Gear could always progress horizontally. But even that would cause changes to class balance.
---
If a raid regressed, the items it dropped could also lower in quality and any newly introduced raid could have gear stated similarly to the last.
---
I know on privet servers it was level 10.
---
How ever I do also seem to recall you needed to be level 10 back in the day too. I remember polearms we’re level 20 as well.
---
&gt; it's basically a completely different game under the hood
---
No it's not, it's basically the same game with a few inconsistencies
---
&gt;/sit macros? 
---
wow warriors have a bit easier time levelling, totally unplayable. give me a break, lol.
---
Have you ever even played a private server in your life? What makes you qualified to say it's a 'completely different game under the hood', because you read a post on reddit about how some cit caps and armor values were messed up on some bosses? Stuff that people who actually played basically had figured out and knew about already 8 years ago?
---
You are talking out your ass.
---
Imagine getting third-partied in world pvp.
---
While I originally thought it was a stupid idea, the idea of people being able to group up with members of different factions, maybe even chose their own allegiance has become extremely intriguing to me. I mean in WoW lore, you have several stories of mixed groups (like orcs being pals with humans). I don't remember the details of the suggestion but again, while it initially sounded pretty "nah", it has grown on me. (not suggesting that it should be added to classic, just telling anecdotes)
---
As a hunter during Vanilla, this was quite annoying, was very much not prepared for this battle. So many arrows.
---
I actually like the catch-up raids, especially compared with their current approach of "throw all your gear in the garbage after each patch".
---
The only difference I'd like to see is when they release a catchup 20-man that is 1 tier behind, they also release a catchup 5-man that is two tiers behind (and tuned to require pre-raid bis, or close to it).  I'd prefer they keep at least one BiS-at-each-tier item per class/spec in each 40 man though to keep people doing them as long as possible.
---
That said, I won't be butt-hurt if they just never release new content for classic.  I like the game for what it is, unfinished zones and all.
---
Functionally it's reverse of cross realm zones.
---
Instead of filling up hollow zones with people from multiple servers, it splits overcrowded zones into multiple instances.
---
I’ll just copy and paste this from my old comments.
---
Okay, I see a lot of people saying Dual Spec. I understand why you want it and I understand it’s convenient. As someone who plans on going warrior tank, even I have to admit it would be nice so I can switch to Arms with the aesthetically pleasing two-hander.
---
BUT! I really think that would actually hurt the community more than some people realize. Tanks and healers are highly coveted, especially in the leveling stages. Yes, you can tank without being prot specced (in the leveling stages) but not as well as the warrior who is prot spec. Same with healers, a shadow priest can heal but it’s easier with the priest who went holy. Now, the reason I think it would hurt is because the players who decide to level that way are going to want to group. It’s so much easier for them if they have a damage spec who can deal the damage while they heal you or the tank holds aggro so you don’t have to worry about pulling too many mobs and not having enough health to tank it or having a tank for an elite mob. That person then decides to add you to their friends list and now you have someone who is a critical role for the dungeoning experience, making it easier for you to get in that group. So instead of waiting in trade chat for an hour, you message your new friend and you’re good to go. Making friends and building a community is part of the classic WoW experience. It benefits you to make friends in vanilla and if everyone can dual spec their way in, why make friends? You can just pug your way through everything the same way you can in retail, because you’re going to want a proper tank and healer for dungeons like BRD and Dire Maul. I’m not shitting on you for wanting dual spec, because I understand the convenience of it, but I want people to see why I THINK it would be a bad idea to implement it.
---
Personally, the one thing I would like implemented from retail is archaeology but completely revamped to have more lore in it. I think it would be a neat feature to have.
---
It is the small QoL changes that ruined WoW (for me.) The more you make things convenient, the more it degrades the community. That’s why the current WoW community sucks, to be honest.
---
You can train weapon skills at level 1 except for Polearms.
---
For all the bitching I've been hearing about sTReaMer pRioRiTy, he's been nothing but a hype machine for Classic.
---
Downvoting
---
They could have just sat side saddle.
---
Khadgar with a beard is the best Khadgar.
---
It really depends on the server. 
---
When  I used to play in vanilla my server was like 80% horde and 20% alliance. 
---
Every now and the  the pvpers from the alliance side would come and kill horde dueling outside org so of course we would all rally together and wipe them out. Good times.
---
My vague plan is to roll gnome, exploration/fedex to 6 while getting sw/red ridge/westfall fp, quest/grind till 8 (might need a better idea here), then shortcut method to menethil from dunmorogh and hit darkshore for normal mode questing -really want to avoid the zerg at westfall due to mass kill quests
---
How would Naga have faired in Molten Core?
---
Does it smell like fishsticks in here?
---
you just brought me a back a ton
---
I had this 2h mace on my druid on the previous 1-5lvl stress test.
---
Really cool, thank you for timelining it out like this.
---
I was trying to piece together in my head the timeframes, and see when I started playing and what was already there and brand new (that I didn't know wasn't already in the game from launch.)
---
I want lvl60 Karazhan. 10 man, 20 man. 40 man I don't care. I just want level 60 kara.
---
I think I'd prefer 20man, drops sidegrade from Aq40 maybe?
---
Was it in vanilla?
---
Then don’t put it in classic.
---
It took me and my group HOURS, but damn if it didn't feel great to clear it in the end.
---
LOL that crit!!!
---
I just play a rogue so I don't have to be nice to people.
---
I don't understand why we can't just let Classic be Classic.
---
WoW is not the same type of MMO as Runescape is. It's a theme park with vertical progression.
---
Charge -&gt; TC -&gt; Pop def stance isn't the worst way to open a fight when tanking, particularly if you're leveling fury so you don't have TM to let you preserve that charge rage, but it's rarely worth the trouble of dancing back into battle stance just for the 10% attack speed reduction. In Vanilla the damage on TC is crap and it gets no threat multiplier, also capped to 4 targets so even if you wanted to use it in situations like Gnomer or Uldaman bug pulls, its pointless since you only hit 4 targets.
---
You can tank just fine 1-60 in any spec, and in some ways you might actually be better off tanking in non-proc specs, as threat generation is often more important than mitigation, and Enrage + Flurry generates crazy threat and damage before you start stacking +def gear. Likewise in arms, TM is an excellent tanking talent that lets you make moves like jump into zerker for intercept or into battle stance for a Mocking Blow if a crucial taunt is resisted.
---
I've done the level as prot thing, it's actually not terrible, tools like Last Stand and CB are hilarious in group pvp, and Imp Revenge is just fun in dungeons. Still though, fury and arms are just faster and more fun.
---
Just remember to use protection kids!
---
literally only playing hearthstone now :(
---
with the stress test craziness i managed to get out of Northshire Abbey in 54 minutes.
---
So 3:30 is a good place to be. Grinding would have been my next move since questing spots were way too crowded.
---
Damn. What's the party makeup like for the WR?
---
Because day 1 of classic is going to have more people trying to connect than the peak population of vanilla.
---
I've played on a few private servers. So my input might not be valid, but here's my take on no transmog, and the cohesion of items. 
---
I played an undead mage, and started to be able to tell who had completed what quests just by looking at their character. For example, the Crescent Staff has a very particular look to it, and is acquired from a chain quest that leads to killing four druids in the Wailing Caverns. If you had this staff, I immediately knew that you had done the quests leading up to that, and killed the four druids. I thought that was pretty cool. Ghostly Mantle, and Fire Belcher also have a particular look. And can only be found in Dungeons. 
---
None of this meant to me that "you were worthy". It just meant you had completed some of these quests that lead to that dungeon. I stopped playing after a while, because I want to finish the rest of the content on the official Blizzard Classic launch. 
---
But those are some examples that come to mind, and i liked it. I liked being able to look at other players and know what content they had completed, because of the items they had.
---
Given the restrictions presented by the chinese government on using undead (ie. that you can't) and showing skeletons (again, that you can't.) I can't imagine what kind of raging dumpster fire abomination Diablo Immortal will be.
---
I mean, when WoW launched in china, skeletons became headstones and forsaken went from being undead to basically "humans with bird flu"
---
AV was still 51-60, right?
---
FPS is in no way related to your internet connection. You could have a single player game with no internet connection that had the same number of polygons and whatnot on the screen and the FPS would be the same. Same if you had a gigabit connection.
---
Conversely, you could be running at 200+ fps and still be lagging out during the event. People would freeze in place, but their animations would still be smooth.
---
That's what you get for rubbing salt into Metzen's wound
---
I think a counter point that people don't seem to think about.
---
While Alliance will lose easily 2/3 of the BGs they get into. The queue timers can get rather long on the horde due to the aggressive aesthetic seeming to attract more PUGing pvpers.
---
So while you may win more often.. Alliance BG queue times seem to be darn near instant
---
I'm kinda leaning towards that, just need more testing time :(  Human normal 1 hour 1-5 exploration, do quarry in dun morogh, hearth back to elwynn and knock out the fedex there - just to 8, then move on.
---
We'll see.
---
I mean this doesn’t really matter because it’s beta (aside from blizzard maybe addressing this somehow), but isn’t this some kind of exploit that could in theory get this guy banned?  It’s incredibly unsportsmanlike if not straight up cheating.
---
Due to new/recent laws in the US if your employer provides time off for being a primary care taker (aka parental leave) you can claim that, even as a male. Your job has to offer it, but they can’t refuse you for being male or provide less time off than they provide females.
---
Used to get gold for running people thru this when it was just vanilla
---
Most definitely.
---
The problem I have is you choose your name, character and server the week before if you have a sub (if you want a jumpstart). So to claim your name and such you would be committing to a server before knowing. I do not want to be on a streamer server at all but I do want to get my name before launch day.
---
It’s almost like every day someone new comes to this subreddit and thinks that they’re the first person to think “what happens after naxx?” So they make a new thread that says the same things that have been suggested every day for the past year.
---
We need some sort of rule that prohibits these posts lol
---
lolmao im gonna need one of those facebook post circles for that one buddy, cant find a patch of ground
---
All of this is just my opinion, but I disagree. Wow subscriptions climbed until the release of cataclysm, and there was a reason for it. Both TBC and Wrath were full of amazing content.
---
The problem with horizontal expansion is that things get stagnant. Sure, new content will help it feel fresh - but unless you start making changes to things like class spells, etc...it gets old, fast. And if you start making changes, who is to say it won’t end up like current wow? It also opens the door for blizzard to justify a paid “dlc” since they aren’t gaining revenue from expansions. Nobody wants to see that happen. 
---
I think they should progress through wrath and then release new expansions that follow community feedback. Take the good parts of all three expansions and make a new expansions. You run the risk of ending up where we are today, but at least we have three solid expansions that we all know and love before the changes start to take effect. 
---
Again, all opinions of mine and nothing more.
---
i dont remember the 1st time but i do remember the horrible wipes
---
I gonna slaughter everyone that i see.
---
Fury tank, no offtanks. 1 priest, 1 druid, 2 warlocks, the rest fury warriors, mages, and rogues.
---
Not as far as I know, but feel free to show me any lore that says so. I have to know if my chill horde bretheren are really such savages.
---
Moore's law says computers should be about 2\^10x=1000x more powerful than they were 15 years ago. What gives?
---
This is also because our type tends to lurk and write a lot on the internet in general.
---
It was against the rules I am pretty sure, but I don't think anyone really got banned for it that I know of except for some that walljumped out at the start of bg, rushed to other side and jumped in before bg started. I think that resulted in a ban.
---
Been at that spot before and another ~5+ spots in WSG, it was also possible to get on top of houses in AB, the best spot was behind/inside the wall behind flag. So noone could attack you and you could just jump out and cap when flag was returned.
---
That makes it more exciting for me. Lots of videos and threads to watch/read about the different classes. I’m finally leaning towards druid or warlock, two I haven’t really played before, but of course that may change over the next couple months :)
---
I'm having a very difficult time finding a raiding &amp; RBG guild. This didn't used to be a problem.
---
What about from Theramore To Teldrassil? Any tips for that?
---
Cant give buff as a hunter :(
---
Sorry, too busy getting a law degree to care about the binary code randomly assigned to you by an algorithm.
---
&gt;with the stress test craziness i managed to get out of Northshire Abbey in 54 minutes.
---
That's my whole goal to avoid. The randomness. Northshire might be 20 minutes, might be an hour. I'll go for a run and get some guaranteed, consistent XP instead.
---
Can we please not do this? One eventual right does not excuse endless amounts of faults. If we bark like happy pups the moment they do a single right, they'll keep thinking they can manipulate and screw us over at 99/100 turns. I want to believe they wont fuck this up, and i used to love blizzard as much as anyone, i want this 2 - but can we please have some sense and integrity about it.
---
I would always think some cool epics or gold were buried in the graves but no one would ever click on them, they would always say, "No one click the graves, just walk past."
---
Jup it was possible

Best modern CRPG for sure, beat it solo in 2017 and loved it and recently reinstalled it to play it again but in co-op this time with my BF. I'd absolutely love if a MMORPG in the future came out that had similar magic mechanics as that game, combining different elements to create special deadly combos is amazing, it encourages hybrid building a lot.
---
Say anything BRF Sub was peak Sub gameplay, that was the shit.
---
You still haven't made a single argument as to WHY Wrath was the best expansion.
---
Is that it, subscriber count? Is that your entire argument?
---
Wrath had positives and negatives just like all the other expansions.
---
Why even bother posting such a pointless non-statement on a discussion board? What a garbage post.
---
The talents were awesome, classes were fun to play, every spec was viable, but there were negatives too. PvP was fun. However, Pre-Northrend levelling was a joke it was so easy. Heroics were an absolute joke once you got above 2400 gear score (which is not hard at all). The first raid tier was stupid easy, and the only interesting raid in that tier was a re-run of an old raid. The third raid tier was shit. Heroics become extremely pointless and a waste of time once you have Tier 10 gear anyway. Nobody is out doing shit in the world. World PvP is dead. Wrath is the first true raid logging expansion and most people do not like that style of WoW, it's a big part of the reason they hate retail so much.
---
No problem :)
---
Hence "murlocs" :-)
---
And yet Horde had all but one World First raid clear in Vanilla.
---
You can't stress enough that damage dealt is what matters but have no evidence to back up your claim that ret does "top 5" dps in a raid.
---
Kind of an odd position.
---
Edit: To add this statement
---
&gt;But, retri isn't really about topping DPS, it's about topping damage dealt. You have a lot of procs that deal little damage that lowers the actual DPS, but it adds up in terms of damage dealt. 
---
Doesn't even make sense. Every raid fight will last the same for everyone. Let's say the fight is 3 minutes. If you did the most damage within those 3 minutes you would have done the most damage per second over the entirety of the fight. 
---
EG: Let's say a warrior did 108000 damage in that time, that's 600 dps (108000/180). Let's say you, doing higher damage, did 126000 damage in that time, that's 700 dps (126000/180). There's no way to get higher damage but lower dps when the time variable doesn't change. To reiterate, in simple math terms, if all you do is increase the numerator (damage) while the denominator stays the same (time) the damage per time will always increase.
---
They can play the game though.
---
Balls to the wall is the only way to fly.
---
Thanks for the kind words :) Too embarrassed to turn it into a post though! Feel free to repost for the karma if you want to.   
---
I think this is too wordy to be a post, to be honest
---
I personally love the warlock. I just like the RP of an undead warlock alchemist.
---
I also feel like they have the most unique play style with their pets and specializing in dots.  This playstlye works great for dungeons, PvP, and wPvP.  Requires some adjustments for raids. It is fun having to avoid being too powerful and pulling threat. 
---
Plus, despite having great dps, they are also the support unit with soul stones, health stones, imp, and summons; which can pair well with alchemy.
---
Blizzard confirmed in the "it is not a bug list" that this was not a thing in vanilla, and therefor not going to be a thing in classic. So you might see them in a lot of guides on YouTube, but it's purely a pserver thing
---
0-30-21 was my pvp spec with arcanite, and later on TUF.     
---
Was a chain heal boy in pve though      
---
Looking back at it elemental sounds pretty fun at endgame with gear
---
See, that circles back to the OG poster I commented on that I hadnt really considered. The RP aspect while leveling and such. Having a fancy looking staff because you earned it, on this character, means more on a character level.
---
Alliance have the edge in pve in general but if you’re horde and you have a tank with a huge dick that can hold aggro against a raid full of fury warriors with windfury you would smoke alliance raids in dps. 
---
That being said, the overwhelming majority of players don’t even think about what faction is best at endgame so it probably doesn’t hold much of a bearing on faction balance lellys
---
Epic! did it actually move or was it just a slideshow?
---
I’m not but you are as bad as people crying about people crying about no beta.
---
Yep, they want the chinese market. The scummy thing is that they announced this fact at blizzcon - a PC gamers dream convention, a crowd full of dedicated diablo PC gamers, and then gave them a mobile announcement in prime time - knowing full well many of those fans had come for the diablo announcement. They even had the fucking audacity to spit on the people present when they rightly got boo'd. If they want to making fucking mobile games, that is their prerogative,  but don't screw over fans and their money.
---
I don’t get petty over video games personally but sure that makes more sense.
---
Yes, at least for hunter.
---
6 slot bags are 5 silver from the vendor, just buy them.
---
It was masterpiece compared to WoD and now BfA. For me personally it was the best expansion since Wotlk and the expansion that made me to love modern WoW again.
---
And then BfA came...
---
I actually like this. I’m generally against content progressions beyond Naxx (I would like to see TBC and Wrath) - but if they do keep things going, this is a great way to counter act catch up systems or even LFR. Still requires communication and unity within the player base. People still get to learn how to play their classes and experience content.
---
It's not an assumption it's from an actual interview with a pserver dev..... only one of us is assuming...
---
I will main ~~enhancement~~ Windfury Totem Dispenser if I play horde. I enjoy it very much even if it sucks at leveling and end game.
---
Corn staff is best staff
---
Trying to find out why people are angry for not getting into beta and reflecting that anger at streamers who aren’t known for wow.
---
i would like to keep transmog... but the mounts are a good thing ... the poison raveasaur is finally worth getting too
---
Only in the den. Dartol's rod of transformation is the only one useable anywhere I think.
---
*laughs in Forsaken*
---
Well it is very hard to notice the copy pasting unless you zoom in quite a bit :D
---
Mmos as a whole have dropped in popularity. As the gaming audience has grown, the mmo audience has not kept pace. Theres many more gamers now but theres also many more ges to play. There is NO mmo on the market that is as popular as wow at its peak in cata (12million players). In fact other than multiplayer pick up games like shooters or arena games most games dont have am audience that dedicated anymore.
---
Gamers are transient now. They play on release. They play on a patch drop and then stop and move on. Every expansion breaks records and then thg e population drops. No matter how good a game WoW can be it's never going to be 12 million active subs strong for any long period of time. That's not the gaming environment we live in.
---
Transmog has always been a moronic idea for any game based around loot.
---
Demo and battle shout.
---
Uh no. They cannot play in the level 30 meta that is currently going on. That's the whole point.
---
Pre-AQ and post-AQ ret Works very differently. Pre-AQ you build it sorta like a warrior, you don't have a lot of these "little damages" playing in aside consecration, so the DPS seems nicer when compared to the rest of the team. However, you are right, I mixed up "top 5-10 DPS" with "top 5-10 damage dealt". They are indeed two very different things.
---
I don't remember having luffa, but I do recall using carrot and linkins boomerang.
---
Yes this and many more were possible on both the alliance and horde sides.  Is wallwalking confirmed to work in the Beta?  Thought it wasn't, but maybe there are a few edge cases left...
---
Perfect thanks!
---
Can do this same style trick on the northern shore of Darkshore until you get into Moonglade.
---
snakes are fast as *fuck* boiiiiiiii
---
Dude this. I finally got into the stress test server and General looked just like twitch chat, talking 100% streamer shit.  It sucked and I'm not a huge streamer hater
---
It’s because I want to know peoples opinions which I can’t get a from a friend group and I don’t trust the wow forums to give me a reasonable answer.
---
They were starter raids. They had significantly worse loot and were easier than the 25man versions. Besides that the first 2 raids in WotLK didn't have heroic modes.
---
That's fine, but if you choose to belittle someone for it that makes you a bad pers :)
---
Is it confirmed that they are using the older graphics? I was kind of hoping they would use the newer graphics with the old play system.
---
It's odd, online especially streamers everyone seems to an Alliance pleb but IRL from the early days of WoW to modern WoW, all people i met who played or are still playing were Horde players, i never met a single alliance person IRL.
---
But they can play vanilla wow. Which is better than a beta.
---
Wind Serpents still do Nature Damage with Lightning Breath. It's not on a CD but it does cost 50 focus (so that's it's CD, effectively).
---
Proof? And which pservers?
---
The path is available to every player. Not cheating.
---
I've thought a disturbing amount about the body language sort of stuff across years of playing on PvP servers, and that guy is totally on the money. To be perfectly honest, if I see someone /greeting or /saluteing or /bowing, ect, it tells me that they're trying to avoid a fight, usually because they're timid or unsure (because few people will go to such measures towards players that aren't a threat). It will probably gain respect from respectful players, but to gankers who are already looking to punch down, it ironically makes you look like an easier target.
---
You won't be subtle or safe hiding behind a tree or backpedaling at max range. Personally when I'm in the position of a questing rabbit trying to avoid the maws of threatening looking wolves, I find it surprisingly successful to show absolutely no fear. Go right up to them if they're in your way. If you're both questing, pull a mob in front of them to show you're not intimidated. If you feel like emoting, give them a /nod rather than a bow, it shows that you acknowledge and respect them, but you're not particularly threatened. And if you *are* attacked fight back with everything you've got, even if you won't win.
---
Most players will size someone up before attacking, and if you're of relatively equal level, they're less likely to attack someone who is clearly confident and unintimidated. (*Perhaps they have friends nearby? Perhaps they're an experienced player? Or maybe they know something I don't?*) And who knows? Even if the ganker is a max level, personally I've made friendly with plenty of lowbies merely for being the only one to not run away.
---
Of course it helps to have an escape plan, and you might still die. But I've found that I save far more time being bold and getting lucky, than playing on the fringes, fighting for scraps, and looking like an easy target.
---
We might have a few people who eat corpses &amp; some other people who are green due to their parents drinking the cursed blood of a demonic pit-lord, but we're actually the good guys. 
---
You've got until the end of August to make the right decision anyway.  If your friends are trying to make you play Alliance, you have to ask yourself; "Are they *really* your friends?"
---
Back when I was leveling my priest sometimes I would mind control alliance players to buff them, it was a good way to keep then from trying to gank me later on
---
Ok, so idk what this is, but a cursory google search leads me to believe it's a Legion raid. I only fucked with some pvp in Legion, so I've got no comment there. Didn't play long before I quit, plus I've always been more pvp-oriented and I did not like Legion pvp much, especially given what they did to subtlety.
---
Ah okay. That's awesome then. So for the most part, even at launch, it should not be too crowded for users to the point the game isn't playable?
---
Hell yeah 6ft+ master race checking in
---
Nah you just collaborate with the most evil demon in the known universe ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Anyone who doubts that Classic will be popular (I make no claim on exactly how popular it will be) should listen to the crowds reactions to those two statements.
---
"You think you do but you don't" : Dead silence.
---
"Your favorite flavor is vanilla" : House collapses.
---
&gt; Trolls are Taekwando masters
---
I think it's actually capoeira as the troll male dance is pretty much that.
---
Well if your going to min max human is best for pve, dwarf for pvp.
---
I appreciate your effort and commitment here,  but sadly you are actually just a wrong about his whole issue. If ret pallies were viable it would have shown up somewhere in the past 8 years or private servers. 
---
You can play ret if you want, but don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re the one person who has figured it out and everyone else has been wrong all this time. 
---
You’re viable in the sense that if you are like full BiS and play perfectly you can like sort of contend with average, less geared warriors
---
PvE servers can solve this. Hmmmmm
---
LOL @ an Alliance thinking he needs to warn Horde about being ganked. Don’t forget to grab your second account for rage messaging as part of your Alliance starter pack. (Also, nice set up btw) ;)
---
Love me some Mn
---
Yeah OP! You better sit there in your chair with your hands on your knees while waiting for Classic to release!
---
And there's nothing you can do about it
---
Races do have more advantages in classic vs current state. That said, I’d look at the racial abilities and see if they sound fun to you. Get on the stress test and see what they do if you’d like. 
---
No competent raid leader would ever choose to recruit one person over the other due to the race of their toon. 
---
The biggest factor is do you enjoy the race/class combo?  Go with what is FUN
---
Did you have any 70s for this kill? Or was it full guild of people not buying tbc?
---
I actually got my life back on track. I was a depressed piece of shit getting fat and unkempt. I workout for an hour during lunch instead of eating out, I got back on my train to learn Japanese and I put my application back in start the fall semester again. Plus other small changes like getting around to fixing small problems with my truck. All so I could play classic WoW without feeling like a NEET piece of shit, even though that’s exactly what I’ll be.
---
Oh man that was some good times
---
good to see someone picking horde. alliance are just a bunch of scumbags
---
Is my post belittling anyone?
---
&gt; go the route of OSRS where the developers add more horizontal content that expands the game in meaningful ways without rendering all that game before it useless
---
OSRS is a horrible model, not just because it is a completely different game, but very predictably it completely changed the game and made 2007 content obsolete in almost every aspect. It was bearable before, but now they're changing the "new player experience" and it's only a matter of time before we either get HD or every model looks like a horrible Frankenstein's monster of RS3 &amp; old school
---
My mum had one of those Myers Briggs tests done for me as a child and it came out INTJ, which is why she likes to say I'm like Mr Burns. I didn't realise people actually gave a shit about that sort of stuff to the point where they covet it. 
---
Personally I don't really care about it in the slightest but hey, I guess "being" it is a tool I can use to piss off people who desperately wish they were?
---
You're in a great place. I'm a little jealous, honestly. Soak up a little mystery and enjoy figuring it out as you go. Make mistakes and laugh about them later. WoW isn't hard. You'll catch on.
---
Bette than human male ass cheeks clenched so hard you could form a diamond in them
---
Exactly Sindragosa is one of the bosses that did parryhaste so it mattered.
---
No. Experiment. Play.
---
Sure, when raiding have a look at what’s best, while levelling? Not really.
---
First and foremost - enjoy the game. If you play enough, you’ll figure out the best way 🙂
---
That's because all the guys with hair longer than 7 inches were playing horde. They had more time :)
---
All I've done is complain? I gave 2 proposed solutions. Keep the debuff slots at 8 until the raid content comes out where it was changed to 16. 
---
I know exactly what I'm talking about. You, on the other hand, clearly don't. 
---
There was was a massive itemization change where tier gear and everything were rebalanced. I believe patch 1.10. That buffs players and makes earlier raid content easier - which isn't blizzlike. 
---
Do you have anything more emotionally-driven low-iq baby-rage arguments? Cuz you're getting destroyed with pure unadulterated facts right now. 
---
SAD!
---
Ultimately, the races the chose made most sense.
---
They were the original WC3 races: Orcs, Undead, Humans, Night Elves, with 2 going to each faction, supplemented by races included between units of Orcs and Humans: Tauren, Trolls, and Dwarves. Gnomes were the mistake obviously.
---
In WSG? Unsure, but Blizzard has said they were going to remove stuff like getting "on top" of Org, or "under" Stormwind and you can do that in Beta.
---
I tanked it in a pug with a bunch of other newbies, it didn't work out so well for us
---
Man, you likely can't find a bigger Horde fanboy on this subreddit. I'd *never* play Alliance for multiple reasons.
---
[But this just isn't true. Horde got world firsts of end-of-raid bosses, but Alliance *dominated* in general progression. Alliance got every world first kill of every AQ40 and Naxx boss except for the final bosses, they got 6/8 for BWL, and they got 8/10 for MC.](https://www.method.gg/raid-history) If we're talking about raid progression and framing it in any way other than the inherently deceitful "world first of specifically the end-of-raid bosses" metric, Alliance thrashed Horde.
---
[And voila, look at BC, after Horde got Paladins.](https://www.method.gg/raid-history/the-burning-crusade) Nihilum is neck-and-neck with Death and Taxes, and then they pull ahead and claim supremacy over all of BT, and [D&amp;T breaks up soon after Sunwell releases.](https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/16/death-and-taxes-guild-disbands/)
---
It was Paladins. They had raid-wide buffs as opposed to group-wide ones, they were far less mana intensive, and BoS was just extremely good for managing threat. Tranquility didn't come close. Once Horde got Paladins, the whole progression race normalized for a while before Nihilum claimed outright supremacy in the flagship "final raid" of TBC before Sunwell was announced.
---
That didn't mean that Horde couldn't succeed in PvE in Vanilla. After gear was more readily distributed to tanks such that threat was less of an issue, a Horde guild could progress just fine through all of Vanilla content. But the edge went to Alliance for an obvious asymmetrical advantage they had.
---
Xmas outfit
---
oh man a "lost content" expansion for classic would be amazing
---
Depends on server, undead and human offset eachother - dwarves night elf's and gnomes are more appealing to people that want to smile all day so they'll be more populated than tauren orc and troll.
---
I've noticed a fair number of myopic, immature, elitist people posting in this sub, but I think they are the minority. They just stand out because they are so abborent. Most posters are generally just happy and excited to be part of this community.
---
Personally, I've played WoW since Vanilla and found things to like about every expansion including BFA, which I play the shit out of by the way. I do think the game was better in the Vanilla and TBC eras. I want everyone to come experience Classic. I want a massive and diverse player base because it makes the game better.
---
Just ignore the jerks and complainers. There will be tons and tons of chill people to play with.
---
I use to do it on my twink when I was around 12 years old and I received a 3 day suspension for doing this on alliance side
---
INFJ here. Orc Warrior, so pretty spot on. I would have never guessed Mage though.
---
How does it take into account performance, consumables, raid preparation and general helpfulness outside raids ?
---
Interesting, that doesn't bode well.  There were a ton of exploits you could do with it in WSG/AV and even a couple in AB, i really hope they're removed.
---
I prefer a combination of Loot Council + EPGP. 
---
There are a small number of items that will be decided upon by Loot Council, using EPGP to help in assisting with the decision. Things like legendaries, tank gear, and other loot that are designated as priority to help the guild. All other loot falls to EPGP to get a move even distribution throughout the guild.
---
Items that are loot council based should be known ahead of time. The idea being, people won't hoard EPGP points for an item that EPGP can't be used on.
---
This is what it always was.
---
Farm those trash alliance.
---
I remember my first abortion.
---
BRF was Blackrock Foundry, WoD T2 raid.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovNvZfdGNOE smth I found, only have my logs unfortunately, no recordings.
---
This looks like exactly what I needed! Thank you!
---
Yeah the Alliance are HUUUGE racist dicks.
---
I love the idea of being able to just hand over £20 for the flying licence. I'd do it every expansion.
---
I honestly don't know why they don't just make Loremaster and Explorer the criteria. There are plenty of other reasons for people to do a dozen rep grinds.
---
This is why I stopped healing DPS.
---
Just don't increase level. Do whatever you want to, just don't increase level.
---
It doesn't. All of those things are expected.
---
Spaghetti through the Sarengeti
---
I feel you. I used to play League all the time until I heard Classic's release date
---
&gt; Healers have no mana problems whatsoever, because the fights are so short and they can just use mana potions/flasks.
---
fights won't be short anymore with such dramatic nerfs to TPS, and with tanks taking more damage from parry hasting.
---
&gt;The nerf to TPS will be noticeable on the horde side, but on alliance side there shouldn't be any problems with threat due to salvation.
---
Threat has always been tuned with salvation and tranquil air factored in. The fact that pserver guilds have been using windfury with impunity, as opposed to situationally switching between the two totems, shows how trivial pserver fights have been. These have always been elements of raiding and neither will mitigate this wholesale TPS nerf.
---
Your experience is clearly based on a nerfed pserver environment, it's no use as a reference point now.
---
&gt;Also, there's a video of Monkeynews dual-wield tanking Nefarian back in the day, so yes, we will keep doing it in Classic.
---
Fury tanking was always possible for trivial content, which is what we've now discovered was happening on pservers - raiders fighting bosses with substantially nerfed white damage on tanks and massively nerfed mitigation.
---
And this is why I do not fear playing one. I love rogues, I main them in most content for retail and have since WoD. I did play a mage in legion as an alt and they are awesome but world pvp is my favourite and I just want to be that ganky ass hole sitting invisible waiting for unsuspecting allies to walk by haha. They definitely do not seem OP in vanilla, people just hate on them for their stealth into cc but from what I see there are a lot of ways to counter it. The only part that worries me is how long it will take to level. I will be using questie/quest guide and have the first week off, I plan to no life 16 hours a day for that  week and my hope is to hit 60 within 2 weeks from launch. Playing a lock, spriest or mage seems easier/faster to level.
---
The only times it really matters are:
---
Human Warrior (sword/mace bonus)
---
Human Rogue (sword/mace bonus)
---
Dwarf Priest* (Fear Ward)
---
*Not mandatory but definitely makes finding guilds easier. 
---
Orc Warrior, Fury (Axe spec + DPS cooldown)
---
Any other combo is more or less viable.
---
Good but not necessary combos are:
---
Gnome Mage (Int/Engineering/EA)
---
Gnome Warlock (Int/Engineering/EA)
---
Orc X (Stun Resist is very strong) 
---
Orc Rogue (Stun Resist + DPS cooldown)
---
Tauren Warrior, Prot  (extra health)
---
Undead Priest, Shadow (plague dot) 
---
There could be other ones I'm forgetting. But really, except for Warrior/Rogue on ally and warrior on Horde it doesn't matter much. The +skill from those racials, however, is a substantial pve boost in those cases.
---
Fuck offfff with this fucking post pleeeease. I'm tired of downvoting it.
---
You sereriously think a million new players will come back for vanilla?
---
Oh god I still have that saved on my Main on Retail.
---
Before they made swaping trinkets a thing of the past it was a fun thing to have a hotkey for for a quick sprint on demand.
---
I got suspended for this on horde side. They definitely checked.
---
Dragons call was my first epic sword :)

With this event i met wow form the first time, some guys were playing in a TCG local... I felt in love since then
---
I remember first time I did this with my guild :P We had a paladin who slept on his keyboard and he run down straight to the mobs and stuck at the fountain lololol(somehow he pressed the auto run..). we wiped before we even start. These were the days.. we only stopped playing when we fell asleep.
---
50/50
---
Came to suggest this.
---
There are no Balance specs that are viable for PVE anymore than falling asleep on your keyboard and waiting for loot is a viable spec for PVE.
---
Nah, I don't agree with WOTLK and Legion. Especially WOTLK, why is it cool to hate on this expansion these days? For me it was the peak of WoW and I've been playing since late vanilla. Yeah TBC was amazing too and it was the first expansion where I actually started truly playing WoW, but story for example was just weak let's be honest. WOTLK on the other hand had everything at least decent with few things being amazing. I mean Warcraft 3 was my childhood, and having the whole expansion dedicated to Northrend and fighting against Lich King. Zones, story, gameplay... Everything was amazing. 
---
And Legion was, in my opinion, the best expansion since WOTLK. I almost gave up on the modern WoW before Legion, but Legion even with it's annoying things is definitely one of my favourite expansions. This is the reason why I hate BfA, it feels like much worse, unfun version of Legion.
---
the big boot
---
Maybe not in beta, but it is exploit and it will get you banned. Ignore other clueless answers.

I went through the same argument with him last week. Dont waste your breath. Only the last boss matters to him. Everything else is just "cannon fodder".
---
You can't possibly be defending this kind of play.
---
Through most of Vanilla ret paladin was very trash, they had their talents reworked in 1.6(around that, and up until that point they only really bringed ret paladins for Blessing of Kings), but up to 1.10 they have been quite weak (at this point they buffed SoC heavily for instance: SoC procced more frequently, and SoC could proc Vengeance.) It's really after that where Rets became much better, but at that point they were basically extint. Private server theorycrafting gave us an opportunity to redo retri paladins, and with the 1.12 client several people were  able to make retri paladins good.
---
If Classic had progressive patch release, Retris would be quite bad again. But since it's a fixed patch all the way, we've been able to theorycraft with gear, test it, and push it to the limits. How about this: mages are considered to be the best caster DPS, so why do people bring warlocks to the raid? Well, obviously warlock dps is much better as they go through the content, but mainly for their utilty. Rets still have a lot of utility: they bring all their blessings, auras, Seal of Wisdom / Light, occasional heal, magic cleansing, lay of hands, divine intervention, the occasional Nightfall (which I barely ever use, but it is nice), and well, damage :)
---
Boomkin is a dumpster fire in vanilla 
---
That's why they call it oomkin
---
1. Tank spec is basically useless pre raiding. Going Arms or Fury lets you do more damage and generate more threat, and you don't need the defensive tree abilities until later
---
2. Sunder is the biggest aggro generator in Classic. Thunderclap was buffed in Wrath I think to make aoe tanking as warrior easier.
---
As a healer, it always made me salty when people other than the tanks took damage.
---
See?  It works both ways.
---
You either play better, or you wait for 10s for me to get mana.
---
Probably because his dad beat him with them.

He’s sweeping the leg freaking cheap shot Cobra Kai.

People asking for unbalanced or empty servers need a safe space? Ok.
---
For some reason, every time I relog or /reloadui, my UI Scale setting resets. I even tried going into the WTF folder and manually changing the value, but that didn't work either.
---
Have a cry
---
You can do theorycrafting for classic anymore. It’s all been done. Literally every possible combination of everything has been tried and tested. Tldr; if you wanna boomy, better have good friends, cuz you won’t be getting any loot from raids
---
I found today that when you LOS a caster mob by jumping onto a wall ( behind a pillar) they will just stand there and stare at the pillar :D Or at least it was the case for that one gnoll.
---
It depends on what you mean by OP. In 1v1 they are OP as hell, but only if you sit there for 10 hours a day practicing duels. To be an absolute monster of a rogue. You need to be willing to put in so much work. People think they are easy because the super pro's make them look easy.
---
The other reason they are hated is because you can kill someone and they have no opportunity to retaliate. If you feel they can kill you. All you need do is stealth and saunter off.
---
Right! Im alliance, for no reason other then Dwarven master race and buildings that are structurally sound.
---
Okay but that's irrelevant considering that layering will supposedly be removed after Phase 1.
---
Like I said, be sure to say hello. Maybe I’ll be nice and run you through a low level instance
---
I joined a raiding guild in vanilla on my Rogue and instantly began topping their charts. The guild was hesitant to recruit me because Rogues "weren't that great". Their assassin rogue was doing ~40% of my combat rogue's damage, raid after raid. He copied my spec and I helped with his rotation (I assume you know the rotation changes based upon gear, right?) So please tell me more about this "playing the game" when you're playing with people who clearly aren't doing their correct rotations.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. 39 other people don't have to put up with your stupid spec or inability to play.
---
I feel like this quest was Tauren only on Pservers. If I remember correctly the mace was even race locked. Could be wrong though.
---
No mats...only giant crocolisk
---
My goal in classic is to make a raid without a full-time Resto Druid. The only healing Druid would be a 30/21 Feral/Resto (me) who usually tanks, but then heals when tanking is not necessary. It would only work if I can find a dedicated Moonkin to bring Improved MotW (which I won't have) and to put HoTs on me when I'm tanking and someone needs them.
---
Everyone can have their place in Vanilla. It's not all about numbers. It's about the group.
---
God damn thats a lot of effort, but it will be downvoted because this has been discussed too much already.
---
* Wrong comment, sorry.
---
I don't like it for retail because any dickhead can go and instaclear old raids and get the gear. I would like it if you could transmog it only if you looted it when it was current. I guess that makes me an elitist or whatever, but I just think that the way your character looks in an MMO should reflect their accomplishments or effort.

---
This guys is kinda a sub-boss.
---
What were horde Queue times like?  Alliance had 35-40m queues.
---
&gt; you obviously never seen well put together and good retribution.
---
You mean playing the cookie cutter spec and hoping for crit and then seal proc? If you're the unknown god that pushes 1k dps as ret, please do elaborate though, I'm all ears.
---
Alternatively 2 talent points per level between 50-60 as to not mess with low level balance.
---
Another bit of more lore specific stuff for Metzen: His original concept for the Forsaken playable race was that they would be diseased humans, not undead.

Lol.  As if we forgot how vanilla was? Im looking forward to 2 months of playing to 60.   And the chaos of high pop.

Main weapon slots were typically melee only weapons , even if said weapon had magical boosting properties, ranged slots however were separate , this includes bows/crossbows/guns/thrown weapons and wands ( and in some cases quest items you needed to use while equipped).
---
Main hand/weapon like the staff always shows but by sheathing it or firing a ranged attack you would sheath the main weapon and it would stay visible even while you were wielding your ranged one.
---
oh really? 2-3 min on average for me :)
---
Let's assume you stick with both Classic and Warlock for the long term. You're going to be staring at your character for hundreds or thousands of hours. The first questions you should ask yourself is if you like the way the race looks, moves, and sounds. Also ask yourself if you identify with it. If you are ok with both options, then worry about racials. In which case, gnome is probably better overall for min/maxing and PvP and human has some nice QoL due to diplomacy.
---
There's actually a jump trick you can do just to the right of the door on some stone blocks to bypass it entirely. Bugged or not. Don't even have to complete the stair event.
---
reading books in 2019 TOP KEK?
---
My class doesn't get its own mount and my race has one I don't like at all. Can't wait for phase 3...
---
I went through there last night on the stress test as a hunter. Had another hunter with me from previous quests and picked up a warrior on the way. Things melted. I basically only used auto-shot the whole time. I did pay the 2.5 silver for the level 3 vendor bow though. Was actually the best run through that place I've ever had. Luckily by the time I got there the World Server stopped going down.
---
Jesus, you’re dense.
---
based
---
Yes, I am.
---
For sure, or get 10 more through class quests or something like how DKs get theirs.  Solvable problems, but extra work nonetheless.
---
If you will be leveling primarily solo, go dps spec, and collect int/spirit geat for when you need to heal.  If you will be leveling in a group; with one other person, go dps, as there will be less overall damage, and you can still offheal if needed. With 2 or more party members, it becomes more viable to spec healing, as that allows your party members to to focus solely on damage, which might actually up your farm speed.  Your comp would also matter, but that would take longer to explain.
---
Just play
---
\* can't
---
16h per day?
---
Filthy casual
---
very intrigued by druid's representation on these stats, they tend to be less played and it seems they will be one of the more played classes for classic?
---
I keep trying to share stealth. No one will accept.
---
It'll be pretty obvious when the Rogue is near the bottom of the charts and dual wielding daggers.
---
See *those of us* who actually played vanilla know these things.
---
This is completely wrong information:   
---
&gt; the game should run flawlessly on even very old computers.  
---
No one could seriously argue this statement is true.   
---
It also gives people the wrong idea that any computer that could run vanilla can run Classic - which is a lie.   
---
In your comment, there is nothing to comment except this misinformation:   
---
&gt;the game should run flawlessly on even very old computers.   
---
Maybe you made a mistake, but a lot of players want to know the minimum specs of Classic.  They are a lot higher than the vanilla client.
---
depression is a normal part of life everyone experiences it
---
turning it into a lifestyle to get attention is cringe
---
Vanilla is a full game, BC and WotLK are expansions.
---
When people say "BC" they think about whole content that was available in BC, which includes Vanilla content. BC as in "just Outland" is vastly inferior to Vanilla. 10 levels of content instead of 60. 2 races with their own cities and starting zones instead of 8 races with their cities and starting zones. 
---
Of course, people generally don't think that way. Those who started playing during BC will associate the original Vanilla content with BC.
---
Just go to YouTube
---
Shamans are strong at lower levels and Druids are pretty weak throughout until they start to get some end game gear. I remember killing 2-3 equal level people in Vanilla as a Shaman, and I remember Druids being my easiest target. My tip would be to star Bear more and try to outlast their mana.
---
I already avoid the shitty quests by not being in stm and tn lol
---
But to each their own
---
Oh god, really? As long as an exploit or broken mechanic is technically speaking available to everyone, it can't be a cheat? Do explain why Blizzard permabanned a whole guild for skipping AQ trash in a 'creative' way then?
---
 How anyone can defend shit like this is beyond me. Ban the offenders and patch it out.
---
I mean. I could hear an argument for Tauren and.. maybe, some orcs being good guys. But, nah.. the whole horde are definitely not the good guys. Neither are the Humans, or Gnomes. Every one is kinda shit, just like Real Life. 
---
But the Forsaken and trolls are CLEARLY bad guys.
---
Coming soon...
---
It's a circle and you have a map!
---
I got level 70 and completed Grulls lair in a World 46 KT killing guild and avid world pvper. TBC was absolute shit outside of raiding. I really liked the 1st raid in TBC but I hated everything else.
---
with the way bfa is now you only have to play 16 hours per patch lol
---
Yeah the very concept of WQ was the start of this big hamster wheel we're trapped in, 100% agreed... M+ as well, in the end, repeatable content was everywhere, fuck that...
---
Coolest bug ever, because I don’t think that’s a place you can really get to normally.
---
if you play a paladin you'll be a dead weight regardless of min maxing, there are some specs in vanilla wow that even if you do everything in your power, they still trash, so make sure you pick a class/spec that isnt a meme
---
It depends entirely on the people you meet and the guild you choose to join
---
Just use aspect of the pack in each dungeon.
---
Goblins and Demons are the first ones to spring to mind.
---
So I should be fine if I take a combo that sounds fun it’s not gonna make me lose like 1400 dps or something cuz I didn’t choose a certain upgrade tree lol
---
I think if you try to play moonkin in pve you’ll go oom in 40 seconds.
---
If you try to pvp as balance Druid in vanilla in moonkin form you will lose. 
---
Watch stormx—that’s what vanilla balance Druid looks like.
---
No idea.
---
Never played much of WC3, WoW was my introduction to the Warcraft franchise and I'm not a huge fan of RTS games.
---
Oh, this is that same guy? I thought it was just some separate idiot.
---
Who broke it lol ?
---
Needs more windows movie making blue screen with white text intro.
---
Oh wow i forgot you can kite those mobs to a capital city lol.
---
.....
---
Its not irrelevant at all.  The entire point of layering is so that more people can be on the servers early on so they dont have to add a bunch of extra servers to support the launch population, which will then end up fairly empty as the tourists leave.  
---
With layering they can keep the initial server count lower and have more people per server.  As people leave there will still be a healthy population on the server.
---
If people *dont* leave (or if there is more hype than expected and more people come back later than was expected) they can always add some extra servers....like they had to do for the first....4? years of the games existence.
---
Because noone else uses the cookie cutter build. Like on any class. Ever. Yes, retri is an RNG class, but I legit swear to god, even though it is braindead, I can't say it doesnt require some skill, basically just like anything else in Classic. But you can control some of that RNG, by building a lot of crit (which you obviously should), and playing with slower weapons for more frequent SoC procs, due to SoC working by a PPM mechanic. You also control the RNG by having trinkets that proc off SoC, Judgment and basic attacks. 
---
And yes, in a raid environment, you can push 1k DPS in Naxx - but what matters is the damage dealt really. Ret paladins in Naxx have a lot of little damage that they constantly deal(Consecration, Lifesteal / Fiery Weapon, weapon procs, trinket procs, Shadow oil), which kinda confuses the DPS meters.
---
Yeah maybe the contrast with WoD helped a lot who knows! but so many things to do, compared with either BfA or WoD, Legion really shines cause the content wasn't aiming at AP or anything, you had ways to gear yourself, ways to get achievs to get special appearances, unique ones through the mage tower, and professions were interesting too!
---
IT'S BEEN OUT FOR A MONTH!!!
---
idjut pls, y u so toxic n salty
---
toxic n salty
---
Excellent, thanks mate.
---
If you avoid those zones entirely then you'll have to do all of the worst Hillsbrad quests and likely do some grinding too just to get by
---
How does hanging toilet paper on your wall indicate that you're ready to play Classic?
---
Viable =/= Optimal
---
Seen it done multiple time. Smite for over 2k. Fast cast and best part about it is players cant stack holy resistance. 
---
Its still a lot more viable than Moonkin which I tried with good gear and is very fun to play around.
---
Seems fitting on this sub. I photoshopped our raid group out of the photo leaving just our hunter group. Thought it was cool with all the rok and lochs... my hunter was the dwarf. Im 36 now so this was a long.. long time ago. Cant wait for the revival.
---
Ps.. sorry about the resolution .. we didnt have 1080p back then lol
---
race only really matters for Priests and even then, if you show up for raids and you aren't afk, you'll get a spot.
---
This is offensive to gnomes. 
---
I demand blizzard implements height equality.
---
Big Bad Pauldrons were the shit!
---
correct they are a Canadian snack, essentially a calzone filled with cheese and pizza stuff. they are slightly bigger then a hot pocket
---
What type of raiding are you doing where the boss drops to 0 without anyone talking / using voice rofl
---
yup yup! agreed, don't worry! Legion was as good as a WoW xpac would get, if that's better said! It made the changes and all worth it because you had various sources of entertainment, various reasons to login, but fuck WQ's and emissaries tho...
---
The guild &lt;Overrated&gt; was banned for using a 3rd party program that allowed them to get through walls so they could skip C'thun trash. Not the same thing at all.
---
I probably remember you from the comics then! Kinda got a massive case of deja-vu when I saw the name, heh
---
When &amp; where is the event going to be at the end of the stress test?  Thanks in advance, guys, I'm not sure where to find the info. &lt;3
---
I dont see how a class can be called playable when its litterly benched for a whole xpac
---
Troll caster or hunter.
---
oh come you dont actually believe that do you
---
Just a while ago I had like 1 min queues, there were like 16 wsg instances going on.
---
I hated taking an elevator to pickup or turn in quests.  
---
I'm also not a fan of giant sand colored pillars.
---
Idk those two areas were just not for me.  I like hillsbrad and southern barrens.
---
Human paladins are not objectively garbage my dude. Hope this helps.
---
Nah. I’m playing horde for the first time (well, for the first REAL time in classic) and I don’t want to spoil the fun. I’m not going to bash on people who do use it like an elitist, but I’m also not interested in questing with people who do use as it takes away from discovering the world. Well, for me anyways.
---
Bug fixes? In *my* classic!?
---
Inb4 no changes crowd
---
I think there's no such thing as a viable Oomkin spec in PvE, and it's pretty meh in PvP too. I suspect it's actually the worst possible tree of any class in the entire game when it comes to finding viability in at least one of the PvXs. Even Prot Pallies at least have niches in 5-man tanking, and Ret or Enhancement can do RNG burst nonsense in PvP.
---
More people here than all of BFA
---
is this Australia??
---
Nice :D I plan to do it in like 18 min
---
It depends on how they decide to tweak it. But it should not be noticeable in general.
---
I could never run a guild lol.
---
Don't really know how the personality really reflects on me.  (**Virtuoso ISTP-T)**
---
Now that I've read more of what it says about strengths and weaknesses these results seem to be pretty on point.
---
I had a lot of fun during HFC, I got to drive the ring so my opener was really fun to pull off. I miss WoD Sub so much... Nothing since Feral got changed after Nighthold comes even close to the fun I had with that shit.
---
Temporary curiousity is not a sign for long term success.
---
I'll say it over and over. I love classic, I've been passionately debating for it and smiting all those assholes who go "it's just rose tinted goggles" or "classic wasn't hard" or other bullshit continuously, so this is no hate BUT...
---
The beta and the upcoming release are a huge curiosity magnet right now and way more people want to try it out than are gonna stick with it. Saying this is any indication for long term success is ... bold (or naive).
---
None of this means it won't be successful. It just means we can't know yet.
---
HAHA we're gonna DOMINATE 2%
---
Horde is better at PvP than PvE. Alliance are just bad. Honestly, the amount of changes made in Vanilla due to alliance being unable to complete content is pretty crazy.
---
Roll a priest and get wand spec spec into the priest mana shadow talent after a killing blow and just smite dot and wand stuff to death
---
Damn, there’s issues with the layering?  Really wish those idiots would beta test the stuff!
---
I’m sorry, but you’re confused. 
---
This is exactly how it will be WITH layering. Layering is no phasing. Your layer will have around 3500 people. Your starting zone will be a total disaster regardless, because they have said they’re done with phasing the starting zones. 
---
Layering - dealing with population issues 
---
Sharding - dealing with zone overpopulation. 
---
They have done away with sharding. You’re confused, but I understand. It’s kind of hard to get, especially with all the misinformation and QQ on this subreddit. Just chill with the “herp derp” comments in the future unless you actually understand.
---
&gt; take plains walking from tauren
---
haha, how can you take that which they never had
---
i'm still mad btw
---
Gnomer was rad.  Like Chernobyl.
---
Well, if it's available, it's not a cheat apparently.
---
Agreed! They had SOOOOOOOO much planned, things all the way up to WOTLK! It's crazy how much was cut before final release, would be awesome to actually raid Kara in vanilla like they originally had planned.
---
no changes
---
The way I heard it, needing to have eight warriors (or ferals as a second best solution) to do Four Horseman broke lots of guilds. So while AQ guilds with nine to twelve warriors in their A team may have existed, and I am not saying they didn't, an awful lot of Naxx guilds clearly didn't have nine to twelve warriors in their raids when they started Naxx.
---
Enjoy low level and slow progression, I don’t give a shit. I don’t take my advice, it’s better you don’t if you’re in school anyway.
---
Got in the first stress test, currently in this one. Have never gotten an email. Just check the launcher a few times a day.
---
Fuck mate you dead and nearly frozen RIP
---
I'm not familiar with "FedEx runs" - is it primarily running around and gaining XP from discovering sections of the map? I'm guessing you may sprinkle in some quests?
---
I played 1 wsg and it took 30min to pop
---
Forced respawns absolutely was a thing in Vanilla, it's why every Mining/Herb guide tells you to mine every node you see even if you are only looking for a certain resource because mining a Mithril node spawn could force a Thorium node respawn.
---
Respawns based off online population also definitely were a thing in TBC, as the bigger servers consistently had shorter respawns than the ones with smaller populations. If a Vanilla Dev is saying that was a thing in 1.12 also, I believe him.
---
This dungeon, the stair event, and Tanaris in general are solely responsible for a lot of my Classic/BC nostalgia, as I often hovered around that level range (40-50) for quite an immense amount of time as a kid. Wasn’t that big of a fan of the changes made to the zone and dungeon during Cata, so I’m extremely excited to revisit their true forms!
---
I remember coveting Dreamwalker. That set was beautiful.
---
Yea but at the same time they nolife and noble 60s get bored clearing them 24/7 :(
---
It's mostly a less populated PvP server with less kids, and more actual names instead of xxWanglordxx
---
I’m sorry you’re confused. Please read up.
---
Maybe in PvE...
---
The mining thing has nothing to do with dynamic respawn rates.
---
This raises a good point, I know the classic client is 1.13.xx but is there a way to see the base wow client? Meaning the mainline 7.5.xx or 8.x it is based off of?
---
Googling "what spec do I play" does not suddenly mean you're good at your spec. I'll take an assassin rogue that knows his rotation and stat priorities over an asshole combat rogue who has no clue what their doing but read your reddit post.
---
Put a 5% in all physical damage reduction in exchange for that already present hidden smaller hitbox and you're golden.
---
If you were to roll as a gnome rogue, and use the orb of deception, you'll notice do in fact have all the rogue animations.
---
And im fucking livid I can't roll as a tauren rogue. My dreams of being a sneaky refrigerator... shattered like ice built up by a bad condenser. Never will I have the opportunity to live life as the cold cow killer, the sub-zero beef i so desire.  Instead, I must live life like a wendy's burger, never frozen.
---
I'm not entirely sure I know who you mean.
---
If you are not aiming to be on the preeminent premade and if you have no interest in speed running, your race is nearly inconsequential
---
Will you notice a difference? Well...yeah, they ARE different abilities. Does any racial put someone who would otherwise lose into the winners bracket? Not hardly. 
---
Dwarf priest is the only combo that has any real substance behind it, and even still—1/2 the playerbase manages without fear ward just fine—it was horde who killed KT first in the day. 
---
Play what you like. If you’re someone who is super into min maxing—min max and don’t feel guilty about it. If you’re someone who is more influenced by what casting animation, emotes, shoulder pad size and posture then pick the one that looks best or “speaks” to you. 
---
That said, fem dwarfs with pigtails are the most lit healers. So fem dwarf priest is super cash. 
---
To your paladin point, if a healer, surely dwarf is better? Stoneform seems a lot more useful than weapon skill.
---
If you wanna be a ret god, sword/mace skills helps a bit. 
---
Nothing is objectively garbage, except people who plays gnomes.
---
Its still too early to have a serious calculator with so many unknowns but I made this simple [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zdipspr2iTdoKM4k19vIuvWvqxmUGzHEV161AQWY0Kk/edit?usp=sharing) to play around with.  
---
Most of the formulas are only guesses based on what we know so far so don't take it as gospel.  
---
You can do File -&gt; Make a copy if you want to edit it.
---
Originally I was going to suggest your wife play a Druid so you're not splitting mail/plate, but then I was thinking that if she's healing, you won't really be going after the same gear anyways. 
---
Your profession setup looks pretty good, Herb/Alch will likely be a decent moneymaker early on, as will the bags your son will be able to make. 
---
Going blacksmithing at the outset might allow you to fill in armor gaps for you and your wife as you level, but you'll likely get stuck at some point when you run into all the wierd mats like gems and other world drops. 
---
Raw materials aren't going to be crazy moneymakers in the beginning, because no one has any money yet. If you do go mining/skinning, I'd hold off a month or two before selling it all off.
---
Legion had far more RNG bullshit than BFA.
---
My character doesn't face the mouse though (for me at least). It turns to have its back directly to the camera, regardless of where the mouse is pointing.
---
I was on Ravenoldt US. Everyone mained Rogues, and if you didn't you had an alt.
---
Except that WoW has had the slowest drop off of any subscription MMO ever released. And the reason they stopped releasing sub numbers wasn't just because those numbers no longer made them look good, it was also because those numbers were no longer relevant. There are no other subscription-only MMOs left for them to compare to at all, and a significant portion of their revenue is now from services (transfers, race change, etc.) and in-game purchases (mounts, pets).
---
It's honestly insane that WoW has lasted as long as it has when compared to other subscription MMOs, and keeping the game static for 15 years was not going to accomplish that.
---
It's great that they're releasing Classic for those who want it. But anyone who thinks it's going to cause some huge resurgence in subs for Blizzard or bring back some huge playerbase that left before is completely delusional.
---
You misunderstood. Top 5 damage dealt will be top 5 dps. Full stop. It's not some weird esoteric definition handed down through generations by bards, it's literally just a fraction.
---
Yep and steak. Mmmmm surf and turf
---
Yeah unfortunately for you mate, I was a combat rogue who knew his rotation, knew his stat priorities and knew which gear was better. The assassination rogue could never beat that.
---
But people, tell me more about your worthless test in full gear.
---
Trying to level a night elf, kill a mob DC, kill a mob DC, kill a mob DC...world server is down.
---
He will not get banned for this no becuase its beta, exploit as much as u possibly can/want. Thats why we have the beta, to find out shit like that.   
---
On live servers on the other hand, do it too much and I'm sure anyone who does it will get banned, for that exact jump atleast, not the other ones. Also I'm pretty sure Chance wont do that one on live.
---
Im playing league until classic, and my girlfriend mentioned how Im so calm when I play league. Calm, in league?! I realized its cause I dont care about anything except release. Idc if I lose in league, it doesnt matter, just CLASSIC
---
Sharding would make the game feel empty. Layering (although could still potentially do so, especially later zones in the first couple weeks) is not the same as sharding. Layering could potentially make the server OVERpopulated, resulting in its own basket of issues. You’re confused about layering and sharding though.
---
Sidesaddle.
---
No problem.
---
I swear I saw a Naga rogue player in Dalaran one day. Even the tooltip said naga.
---
Because warlocks cant play a healing spec and are very needed in raids
---
By all means, play ret. I’d just warn you against getting your hopes up that you’ll be like a vital part of a top guild. You can probably find a guild that will begrudgingly bring you to raids if you’re super consistent and on top of your consumables etc
---
I beg to differ dude, I've done precisely what he said on many occasions. It's perfectly doable.  
---
Mount tabs does the same as transmog does to gear imo. Makes it a bunch of data. It is no longer an item, a mount that your specific character dedicated time and effort to get. It's just another mount skin in your scrap book. Pets i cant claim to care about, but those 2.
---
Ya mon
---
Metal spikes arent that common in Vanilla iirc. I think that trend really started in BC. I could be wrong though.
---
The best race for Druid is NE and Tauren 🙌
---
lol... yet never reported. Fucking pleb streamers.
---
I’m not confused at all, the community is.  It’s been demonized beyond belief for absolutely no reason and the downvotes on my post show that.
---
Shaman get windfury at level 30
---
I feel like you didnt read ANYTHING that's been written here. The point is dont be an asshole who says all of _______ are trash. (Like you)
---
The PvP today has been nuts. I enjoy the limitations of level 10 WSG. 
---
You don’t have to remember too much about each class matchup to be effective, and conserving your limited resources/cooldowns is everything.
---
That was a pretty slide show on Earthen Ring.
---
I feel Wrath of the Lich king should come before Outland. It’s clear that Naxxramas was supposed to push us in that direction, but plans were changed. Perhaps because they wanted to add the races to allow horde palis and alliance shammys.
---
You have some really cool ideas though. I don’t feel that new mid level content is necessary, but it could convince players to roll alts. New races and beginning zones would already have that covered though. 
---
There were also major hints in Vanilla about the emerald nightmare. In retrospect, a first or second expansion could have included the broken isles  and had major patches for both Deathwing and the emerald dream, possibly ending with Azshara
---
I like how Silvermoon brings about Kael Thas without presenting him upfront. New races don’t necessarily need a capitol!
---
We need a follow up on this guy.
---
40%, but yes. melee to the back boys!
---
i want one change in classic wow.  
---
A Hayven Memorial.

Yeah this is an issue I have now haha. Any time I do not have 100fps up to my 144 I can easily tell. 60fps actually looks like shit on my 144hz monitor. The weird thing is on tvs with my ps4 pro 30-60fps looks okay. So its a combination of your eyes adjusting and the screens ability to display more.
---
All I keep finding is an openly hostile general chat.
---
Think my game is bugged?
---
Old models are better fite me
---
alliance!  https://odobros.com/

I don't know what to tell you, other than that when I tanked in Vanilla and TBC everyone who actually read the theorycrafting posts on EJ knew that parry was *significantly* higher on raid bosses than is supported by the weaponskill vs. defense formula, even if they didn't know the exact value.
---
I am disconnecting a lot all of a sudden. I wonder what is happening.
---
Asmondgold is so obnoxious
---
yeah, I hate how stuff gets made irrelevant when a new expansion comes out or new tier nowadays.
---
I remember EVERYONE wanting that Lavishly Jeweled Ring from Deadmines. Didn’t matter if the stats were good for your class or not; it was something to stick in a slot that would otherwise be empty until level 30 or 40. 
---
Same with trinkets; useless, useful, didn’t matter. You just wanted to stick one in there.
---
You’re downvotes are because you’re not understanding layering and shardings differences. Also, you’re falling into a confirmation bias. I’m completely against layering and think it will destroy many servers if they don’t allow transfers off, but it seems like everybody think layering is the best thing ever. We see what we want to see. That doesn’t change the fact that your comment was downvoted because it displays a lack of understand of how the system works.
---
Dwarfs &gt; every argument one could possibly make. Not even Thrall. Or Tauren. Or Windfury. Or trolls. Or Cairne. Or Mulgore. Or Barrens.  
---
Damn I really wish Dwarfs were Horde.
---
I’m not attacking or defending exploits here, but using something coded into the game that shouldn’t be there is WAY different than downloading a program to forcibly do something.
---
This video make me always happy because it is time when i was young and playing vanila :) and old allakhazam
---
First off, well said. 
---
Second. They could do both.
---
I don't care what happens with the current version of wow, but really hope they handle classic well!
---
I wouldn't say it like that. I liked Legion. My class was well designed, it had a cool hub, I had quests for either my class or my profession that I wouldn't get otherwise. The lore was interesting enough compared to other bullshit. Raiding was fun, M+ was a new excellent addition. The problem from BfA is recycling the repeatable grinds hoping it would keep us busy. They took us for fools when they thought islands and M+ and warfronts all for the sake of AP was a good idea.
---
There will be add ons and you will just have to accept that. Either use them as well or don't but don't complain about advantages if you choose not to lol.
---
I specifically want to do troll builds.
---
i want to like BFD but the low ceilings drive me crazy, especially the tunnels at the start with the stealth mobs too
---
what's NE?
---
1. You don't need to go Protection until you start raiding. I switch to Protection when I get close  to 60 and start tanking the higher level dungeons, but it can be done in Arms/Fury too.
---
2. Thunderclap can only be used in Battle Stance thus doesn't benefit from the Defensive Stance threat multiplier, which wouldn't help much anyway since TC is pretty bad.
---
Exploration gets the first 3-4 levels or so, then we move on to quests.
---
&gt; I'm guessing you may sprinkle in some quests?
---
Primarily only quests that involve "go here, talk to this dude, deliver this"
---
Like Crown of the Earth in Teldrassil. "Go to Moonwell, click on this vial in your bag" - they grant 500-1100xp each, and you can do them with 5 people in the zone, or 5,000 in the zone.
---
It prioritizes competition-free quests.
---
Why would we have 70s for this kill? AQ40 wasn't even open at the time.
---
a big content patch+rebalance of the classes so we can get more spec diversity i honestly feel like they had at least 2-3 patches of content before TBC that could have been fit in
---
Well some bosses will have lower armor than on private servers, others will probably have higher armor. 
---
The thing I find most interesting is how the increased parry will affect the meta. Will DPS classes without threat reduction have a harder time? Will DW tanking be non viable due to parryhaste?
---
Probs be a good idea to macro some emotes. As a warrior all I can really do is jump in appreciation.
---
I know how the system works.  It’s a good system and it’s not going to destroy economies etc.  It’s going to be turned off before the end of phase one.  As someone who remembers the way servers were day one years ago I’d rather the small issues it presents over the alternative.
---
I really like the idea to keep low level mats relevant. Encourages low levels to engage with the economy and keeps old zones alive for pvp.
---
Does this have any effect on choosing a human vs NE for tanking MC/Ony/BWL? Will humans still be the choice pick? A little more so, little less so, or the same?
---
You don't need to do more than verify they have a bunch of it - many items and tier sets had noticeable effects prior to 8/8. For one thing, pvp gear has more stamina and pve more mp5, as he pointed out. That matters in how you approach the battle - the mp5 guy you can more easily nuke and the pvp guy you could try to outlast. The tier1 rogue having more energy is also apt i think, as thats like 4/8? Which matters more than you think, allows another backstab.
---
That's not counting items like hand of edward the odd or ironfoe either, which has unique procs that would also change your strategy against them.
---
Hell, sometimes you would catch a guy clearly in his resistance gear, and know you had an easy victim. Besides all that, making your gear more than a bit of data gets you attached to it. It's not some look you choose from a fashion magazine, it's your look, and when it improves your happiness spikes considerably. The list really goes on dude, its a perfectly good argument.
---
It is forced respawns, and it was one of the things the Vanilla Dev was talking about with how killing a boar at one spawn point could cause another one to spawn somewhere else (which is not currently working in the Beta).
---
In advance, sorry for formatting. Now to shit on this retail casual (/s):
---
Transmog: In classic gear showed us where that player has been, what accomplishments they acquired, and gear was actually “valuable”. Even though as some say, the gear wasn’t matching or was ugly, it was a symbol of your character. Nowadays TMog has pirate costumed mages and all this random bullshit on a max level char and that kinda ruins the point. Are we not supposed to be getting stronger as we level our gear up? It doesn’t matter now because some dude dressed as a pirate is clearing mythic +. Tmog also ruins some of the economy with gear prices going up because this “red belt looks cool!”. I see the flip side of the coin because it gives someone something to do at endgame or a way to make gold. Encourages solo play. It just isn’t classic, stay in retail and that is ok.
---
Flying: GTFO, this is classic not BC. Seriously why would you even bring this up. It wasn’t a QoL change really, it was a game changer. Never for classic, I’m fine with it in BC onwards. Encourages non-pvp interaction and desocialization. 
---
AoE Looting: Asmongold had a decent point. Making this change would have a big effect on the economy. Runs that may have taken 20 mins take 15 mins and so on. People would be getting more loot faster and the economy may be over saturated. Can’t say to much otherwise, it would be nice but it doesn’t make me mad.
---
Sharding/Cross-Realm: Classic is about socialization and working together with the people on your server. CRBG is fine imo but I wish it came later. Sharding sucks, your with someone one moment and then poof gone (while unpartied). Removes socialization with people on your realm and adds people you will never see again.
---
Dual-Spec: Classic as stated was a social thing. People knew others as Blank the ICE Mage, etc. Not only does it follow the more RP nature, but it gave you identity.  Another point, classic made you make those tough decisions. Did you wanna pay the gold to respec or buy some stuff off AH? Or if you actually know how to play the market or farm efficiently, gold wouldn’t be an issue.
---
LFR: SOCIALIZATION. LFR was free loot. We wanted classic for it to be “tough” again. Whatever “tough” means to you, whether that was raid difficulty, money, w/e. Made endgame dumb to me now we had 3-4 versions of a boss. 
---
TLDR: most of these changes made WOW less social and made the game more single player oriented at a fundamental level. These went against the philosophy of vanilla WoW and I think you would enjoy retail more. I would like all to play classic but it doesn’t seem like it is for everyone. Good luck and For The Horde!
---
I think you're the one showing yourself to be the asshole here, mate.
---
/dance and jumping around
---
Got slaughtered with a pickup group.
---
I wish they offered a cheaper classic sub for those of us who will never play retail again after BFA and just want our classic fix :P.
---
I'm also in the camp of:
---
What the hell why would you put in this much work and thought into this post
---
along with a hell no this is taking post-nax content WAY too far
---
Yea, unfortunately that one is alliance only :(
---
The difference between dps output between human and dwarf is minor. 
---
Also 1400 dps is like end of the game max gear dps...and it’s high even for that.
---
Further if you’ve never played vanilla before, I’d just assume you write off playing a ele/enh/ret/feral/spriest in raids. Those specs and warriors tend to be your biggest neck beards, experienced players who have a noted passion to grind and put in long hours of pre raid prep will be the types of people playing those specs. Even in less hardcore guilds, your most hardcore will still be those specs. 
---
In terms of healing throughout or dps, racial abilities are a 1% or less difference. Malt classic races don’t even have a dps oriented racial. Theyve got shit like an inconsequential amount of reisistance or +10 to a profession. 
---
Most facials are defensive or utility.
---
Heh, somehow totally forgot about the steaks /drool
---
You need to be exalted with the other races, to buy other race mounts. The PvP mounts im not sure, but you need a certain rank.
---
Tbc just made all the classes alot more... worthy?
---
Completely disagree. Dressing up is part of the RPG games.
---
people loggin in for the "stress test finale" that admins announced yesterday.
---
"Now I'm going to kill you all" Poor guy knew how dumb that scripted line would sound
---
I would say Tauren really are good guys. Probably the best  overall. Which is a really weird contrast to the savage orcs/trolls and the quite evil forsaken. Its basically Tauren &gt; every Alli race &gt; every other Horde race.
---
I miss when mages used to give my rogue arcane intellect. 
---
Thank you for the useless but thoughtful buff, kind stranger.
---
Im visiting my brother in amsterdam right on release day, so we gonna eat some space cake and start classic togheter.
---
TBC was too casual for you LMAO
---
Found out about the stress test 4 hours ago. Spent the last 3 hours getting a tauren shaman to 10 so I could WSG. Now the server is crashing and I have less than an hour :(
---
Esfand just made a video when he's /sitting to proc Reckoning. It must be timed to match spellbatching though. Also, according to not-a-bug list, I guess Blizz will fix it so it won't work at all.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Idk I feel like it's a waste of everyone's effort not to have guild banks. The only reason they aren't in is because "muh nochanges", they don't have much downside, they help guilds have accountability for items, reduce account sharing which Blizz isn't fond of, and don't really affect the gameplay.   
---
I could go on for days about class balance but I'll save everyone's time. Just wish they made an exception for guild banks. Oh well feel bad for my officers lol
---
31/0/0 dance on top of mailbox using [Elixir of Giant Growth](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6662) and [Winterfall Firewater](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12820).
---
Thank god you made this post. This is the first time it’s ever been talked about here and we obviously needed it. Thank god.
---
It’s a fucking joke
---
Slippery slope is real, over a decade of changes like this really add up and take all sincerity out of the game
---
Tbc had some awesome 5 man dungeons that kinda was something vanilla packed and wotlk had decent 5 mans too
---
People have to choose to make friends. Blizzard can't force anything.
---
Not sure if trolling, but as much as I dislike Gnomes, they are a perfect counter to the biggest race which is Tauren.
---
I will be avoiding it like the plague. I love pvp and wpvp but I want to power level as fast as humanly possible. So there will likely be a mix, people like me and those who just want to see the world burn. I bet there will be a lot of wpvp in contested zones! So watch out for that haha.
---
I say as long as you're having fun, keep rolling with it. As you get more experience, you might say "Oh man, I can't believe I picked THESE talents, when I should've picked THOSE." Which isn't a big deal. I'm 99% sure that your first talent respec is 1g, then 5g, 10g, etc. until you hit the cap (50g).
---
If nothing else, you'll learn the class, and making mistakes is a great way to learn.
---
Rip mate. I'm just happy I'm in at all
---
And no stupid barbie dolls on Horde.
---
This is one of Blizzard's better ads
---
Once again, sounds like you don’t get it brother. Layering will not change in almost ANY WAY the “way servers were day one”. They won’t combat any issue I think you’re thinking they’ll combat. They are implemented for one reason and one reason only - blizzard wants to lower operation costs by reducing the amount of servers, and eliminating the headache of people complaining they lost their name on a merger. That’s the point of layering. Nothing else dude. Literally nothing else.
---
Edit:
---
If you’d rather have 
---
- easily exploitable BL/DSL mafias 
---
- not seeing who’s actually in your zone
---
- hyper inflating gen/trade chat
---
during layering, and once it collapses
---
- thousands camping you in BRM, instance entrances 
---
- AQ event trivialized in seconds
---
- impossibility of obtaining scarab lord
---
- challenge of completing class quests due to gank squads
---
- over saturated markets with insane “veblenian goods”
---
- loss of identity in a sea of tens of thousands 
---
- increased chances you’re on a streamer server
---
- the overall toxicity of having 10s of thousands on at the same time
---
Over merging smaller servers together once the tourists pass and dealing with the headache of name changes.....we have very different opinions. But keep downvoting me because you’re embarrassed.
---
I was lvl 52 iirc after 6months
---
Pretty sure all the quest hubs added will be available at the start...and on that topic, hey Blizz could you buff the Wildhammer quests to be less pathetic in-light of how awesome Revantusk village is for horde?
---
When is classic being released? I guess I never got the beta access but I can’t wait to come back to the original.
---
Furthermore, Pandaren were planned for TBC but then changed to Draenei later on.
---
At the end of BFA, Thrall wakes up from another Nightmare. It was all in his head.
---
You want them to toss out their casual playerbase for the minority that enjoys challenging long content? I'm sorry, as much as I want it personally that won't happen. I love the idea of Classic WoW continuing seperately, but do you remember the BACKLASH that blizzard got non-stop when they announced flying would be unavailable in Draenor? They eventually caved in, and are now SET to this pathfinder system, which people do not stop complaining about. And those flight-complaint things are what people agree with, sadly.
---
I actually think they will make a remastered tbc and try to sell it as a new game. 
---
It sounds easy on paper to just take out flying but alot of the world deaign was based on flying, even whole zones.
---
Man, im really disappointed in the general chat. This guy that was adamant about flight paths in starting zones being there in BC... ugh.
---
not at all! it was so great. flying mounts are awesome - but, nonetheless, were the beginning of a trend toward community-destroying changes to the game. I said "diverge from post TBC/WOTLK" specifically referring to SOME of TBC and WOTLK elements but mostly the expansions that came after.
---
I personally love M+ and the raids. Artifacts and class spell rotations were amazing complexes to raiding. I loved it and money well spent despite downsides
---
Guild Wars 2 WvW PvP. Getting 3rd partied all the time, man.
---
&gt; Yeah maybe the contrast with WoD helped a lot who knows!
---
Was absolutely not supposed to be my main argument. It certainly helped a little (anything would've been good compared to that heap of shit).
---
I really liked Legion. I fucking LOVED the mage towers. Artifacts were surprisingly cool (even though being one of the 300 chosen mages who get to wield that one legendary weapon IS pretty stupid), there was tons to do. Legion was fucking brilliant by today's WoW standards (no idea how they could fuck up BfA so hard).
---
But still compared to classic it lacked the things that made classic so great (strong server community, complex dungeon layouts, dangerous leveling experience and the list goes on), which is why I'm hesitant to **just** say it was all out great.
---
I had to work like 16 hours yesterday and today, rip the test for me.
---
If you want to be the best mathematical class/race combo for PvE or PvP there is hundreds of guides available to you that all say the same thing.
---
Actually, water temple in Ocarina of Time was the one that took most time (for me) to complete. Just played it again last year (-:
---
So unless I’m reading that wrong it doesn’t seem likes it quite 2% but that’s really cool. Good to know, I’ll keep an eye on it as more data is added.
---
Edit: thank you!!!
---
Edit 2: someone correct me if I’m wrong but the first number is the hit rate with the second being the variance in collected data. So +5 weapon skill accounts for ~.6% hit?
---
I just realised this late last night. Now I have no idea who to level again 😂 😂 😂
---
Cause the video was posted 6months after tbc released
---
It almost feels like that even if you do quest alone, you are never truly alone in world. One way or another, people is helping each other, whether small or big.
---
Retail has open world 40 man bosses, but you basically join the raid, tag it, and tab out while gold farming bots do the work.
---
Mythic gear is mostly recolored LFR/Normal gear. Would Brown Cryptstalker set really be special if there was a yellow cryptstalker set from Naxx LFR?
---
That depends on what you go silent about. This isn't a system you want to be 100% transperant about, if there's the slightest chance it can be abused. 
---
And even with such a big community, it's safe to say some things in the proprietary software will never be fully understood, because we don't have the source code. You can only datamine and test so much.
---
If they don't say anything, it's 100% guaranteed people will try and figure it out, which will lead to more testing of it and possibly an easier time designing it, without giving people the actual tools to abuse it. Im sure it's an active decision blizzard have made, to not say anything about it, while talking so much about so much everything else.
---
Not necessarily. The goal was to replicate the difficulty, they were just off the mark in some areas. In some other areas, Classic is actually harder.
---
So that's where pristine black diamonds are made
---
I would rate Orc F above Dwarf M, it looks better in motion than it does in this image, that is all.
---
I mean...
---
*he's not wrong...*
---
It's important to note that Brack is now the president of Blizz. Gives a bit more weight to his infamous quote, I think.
---
&gt;Calzones are pointless. They're just pizza that's harder to eat. No one likes them. Good day, sir.
---
\-Leslie Knope
---
I just bought that exact flag the other day.
---
Legion was good or decent since it was beetween the shitstorms of WoD and BfA.
---
How weren't they the gnomes? Both races have no home
---
I got a 2 week ban in Vanilla doing this.
---
so epic Lol btw that guys talent build at 7:38 is terrible
---
That sort of thing was possible in old-school MMOs like Everquest. Certain races started out allied or enemies; Iksar were hated by EVERYONE. But you could go out and grind reputation to make enemy factions think “hey, maybe this evil lizard-thing really isn’t that bad.”
---
Of course, increasing rep with enemy factions tanked your rep with your home faction, so you couldn’t ever go back home. And often, your rep with home faction dropped faster than your rep with the enemy faction rose, so there was this awkward phase where you were barred from ALL cities and you just had to wander the wilderness as a random, unloved murderhobo.
---
Ah yes, BC's notoriously unbalanced PvP. Much prefer Vanilla's impeccable class balance.
---
He literally says world bosses
---
Medivh -&gt; Sargeras
---
Retail WoW is a lost cause, it’s not possible to fix that.
---
One of the magic things about classic is the world being alive, as all content is relevant. Retail has expansions of dead continents that will never be relevant again.
---
I personally loved arenas. I think it increased the skill level of the player base tremendously. Before arenas most of my pvp was ganking unsuspecting people in battle grounds pve style.
---
We saw this all the time whenever we would play 19 twink games in vanilla and tbc. There's a lot of places you can only get to with a speed pot at 19.  
---
I think it was mostly suspensions like you get for spam etc, but I've never abused exploits like this either.  
---
GMs had always told me if something doesn't look like it's intended, then it's usually considered exploiting.  
---
There's always going to be people willing to skirt the rules, but I don't see blizz just letting stuff like this happen without repercussions.
---
&gt; Female Tauren are like the only female race that isn't just a female human with a few tweaks.
---
And nobody plays them (not LITERALLY nobody, but I think the only contenders for less players are the other male dwarves)
---
source.
---
Ok, now we need to know if ghost wolf and the druid forms remove savory deviate delight/noggenfogger effect.
---
I mostly wanted to set up Northrend and Outland rather than explore them. I think it could go either way, although Illidan did lose to Arthas. 
---
Given that the level cap isn’t changing, I think refreshing the leveling paths with new zones would be a big boon. No matter how boring leveling is people are going to level alts until they run out of slots. Even just 1 lower level zone/dungeon to 3 higher level zones would help. 
---
Having a new continent to play on without emptying out the old one is a hard problem - essentially that’s how retail got to its disposable continent lifecycle. 
---
I wanted to think of something relatively feasible, so reusing and recycling existing assets as much as possible. As far as Vanilla was concerned Blood Elves were bad guys! It’s more of a leap to have them join the Horde than join Kael’thas.
---
Your focusing way to much on the set bonuses. Overall if you saw a Orc Warrior with AQ Tier 2.5 and Dark Edge, you knew he could fuck you up.
---
I think most people who actually played both would strongly disagree lol. So you'll never really get a good feel for the consensus on this sub.
---
Though I agree with the sentiment about choosing to make friends... Blizzard can facilitate community by making it clear that interacting with other players will drastically speed up your in-game progression. In turn, you keep players in mind that you enjoyed playing with, and you make in-game friends... instead of cruising through dungeons and such with cross-realm players who you'll likely never see again.
---
I think wotlk is where it started to simplify all the glorious wonky mechanics that made vanilla and tbc so cool. 
---
Now in bfa it has been so simplified and pruned I was honestly surprised they could dumb it down any more than what legion did.
---
You open your character in retail bfa and theres basically nothing there except loot 3 stats. Its actually really sad....
---
 I dunno why they designed wow for grandparents and infants but I think they just thought it would be easier to design and balance stuff.
---
Oh sweet Jesus daddy this makes me moist asf.
---
I mean, you could equip the cool looking sword, but it is a bad sword, with transmog now you can have a good sword and make it the cool looking sword
---
ZULUL
---
Don't play the beta myself, but I have been watching a friend of mine. The money rewards of the quests are way too high. He has already had amassed 3-4 gold at level 10 by just doing quests alone.
---
I hope this is just a beta setting/bug.
---
One look into the AH and you already see ridiculous prices.
---
You mean Medivh who was possessed, brought the Orcs to Azeroth to slaughter all life, then killed by soldiers from Stormwind?
---
I mean, if you want to call that collaborating, sure.
---
It has been out for 2 weeks...
---
What rank do you need for the epic pvp set ?
---
Hi, /u/Strobber7, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Just to set the record straight, I love BFA and I am currently playing wow and diablo 3 and will be playing classic as well as diablo immortal.  I'm not sitting around playing phone games and fortnite. 
---
I'm older and have a career.  That's funny, the "real ogs" huh?  I stood outside of gamestop for the midnight release of vanilla wow when I was 14 years old.  I remember playing the world of warcraft custom game on Warcraft 3: The frozen throne after the announcement of world of warcraft.  Spend years and years in Diablo 2 clans, chat room: pvp-east.  Additional years in the notorious Clan xroc chat room of Warcraft 3.   I'm not saying that I'm world of Blizzard's #1 fan.  I don't own all the posters or go to blizzcon but I've been playing ALL of their games for 20 years.  This is just my opinion.  Don't just assume I'm some dorky ass fortnite kid because I agree with Blizzard in some cases.  When I said people will be stomping on Blizzard's doorstep with pitchforks, I don't mean me, I mean it's YOU GUYS, the sheep... "everyone hates blizzard so I hate blizzard" "everyone hates diablo immortal so I hate diablo immortal"  Man, I fucking love Blizzard and I always have.  I even own a few shares of Blizzard stock(ATVI) just for fun.  I just think it's funny when everyone has been shitting on bfa for the last 2 years but now everyone is like "neckdeep in classic" before the game is even out yet.
---
Shes too good for you
---
Oooh, Naga as a *playable* race...
---
I was expecting to see a bunch of naga jetting around the Shimmering Flats track...
---
One of the best moments in my gaming life!
---
Same! That's exactly what I mean. After the hardest content... if it just gets SUPER easy, it defeats the fun. At least Spirit Temple, Shadow Temple, ETC. were still very challenging.
---
It's the cost that's the issue. We didn't need a more skilled player base. Wow is an MMORPG not an e-sport. It was the demands of stroking the e weiners of internet champions that forced them to homogenize all of the classes. Now the game is shitty and boring and every class feels the same. Thats what arena level balance means. Every class ends up playing almost the same.
---
That is so not how it goes. Paladin has a cycle which I named "uptime" and "downtime". Uptime stands for good RNG, "downtime" for bad RNG. Lets assume you had a 20 second window where you had good RNG, so your DPS is high, but after that you have downtime for some time. Your DPS will drop, and even with a longer period of uptime after that, your DPS will still be quite low, however, your damage dealt overall is going up quite nicely. DPS =/= damage dealt. Damage dealt is the true indicator on how well you did on the boss. Of course there are variables, such as having to run out of the raid on Baron Geddon, at which point you will pretty much stop dealing damage. But you may have been leading damage dealt up until that point, which is what truly matters.  
---
This is also the reason why rogues have weaker DPS compared to mages for example. Mages steadily dish out huge casts non-stop, meanwhile rogues have a burst window, and then their only constant source of damage are white hits. At that point, because they do less damage, their DPS will be lower compared to the mages, but their damage dealt is still very good.
---
I kindly disagree. Whether you use 3rd party software or if you simply abuse an exploit in the game, the outcome is the same; you achieve an unfair, unintended advantage over players who does not abuse the said mechanic.
---
To clarify by example, Blizzard banning the guild &lt;Overrated&gt; for skipping C'thun trash by hacking is an example of usage of 3rd party software.
---
A more recent example of abusing an exploit that is actually coded into the game would be the recent massbans for abusing a leveling exploit: [https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/42610-draught-of-ten-lands-exploit-ban-wave-march-22nd/](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/42610-draught-of-ten-lands-exploit-ban-wave-march-22nd/)
---
Different means, same result. Unfair advantages, that was gained against any and all intentions of the developers of the game.
---
Dev interview as stated above.
---
wow sweet thanks lol i love it when my favorite internet streamers fight
---
venruki is shit at the game
---
Im all for it! We need some boomkins. Just know you will need to get alchemy so you always have mana pots...maybe pick up cooking too.
---
What is the best "buff" class in classic?
---
"haha those are just tourists, not players that are gonna stay!"
---
Like clockwork.
---
You should roll a hunter!
---
It doesn't help that with every successive expansion, new players who joined were more and more influenced by the entire video game and smartphone game companies making all games faster, with rewards more often, and making direct communication less necessary.
---
We could get frustrated at blizzard, but this is just as much if not more so an individual person issue where the more we play a game, the more our brains require feeling rewarded, and the less being social will feel like a reward and more like, as you said, merely a necessity to to speed up in game progression. Thinking of friends as in-game progression facilitators is kind of Craven Imo.
---
The sub numbers speak for themselves. The game would never have reached the audience it did if it didn't make big changes. I loved Vanilla, but it was a tremendously flawed game and most people welcomed BC.
---
I know on this sub you will get more people who hate it, but they don't represent much in the grand scheme of things.
---
Still waiting for a single person to make one good argument for why numerous specs being more or less useless and a few others being laughably overtuned is important to the game design of Vanilla.
---
I'm curious for your reasoning to hate on S8 or what season you prefer. I mentioned S8 because of its popularity amongst multi-glad/R1 players.
---
i find it fucking hilarious that the correspondent is saying that shit right behind the kid while he's playing the game lmao
---
Anyone know what other illusion items are available to the horde besides:
---
* Orb of Deception
---
* Noggenfogger Elixir
---
* Savory Deviate Delight
---
* Dartol Rod of Transformation (Alliance Only)
---
* Grodok Ogre Suit (consumable unique &amp; won't be available til DM phase)
---
Also, I think Carved Ogre Idol from TCG, the vendor came out in BC if I remeber correctly, and even if we did BC not sure if you would automatically get the items if you had them on retail.
---
&gt; If the launch is anything like that, exploration leveling will be much faster than standard questing at first.
---
and 100x less stressful and wanting to punch people for "fucker tagged my mob!" drama
---
I agree - I think it's likely wishful thinking on my part. But I think if they play with the idea by implementing the changes strategically and over time, they could maybe figure this out.
---
So I'm not the only one? Compared to pserver 1.12 client, combat and looting feel really sluggish.
---
They can and should recreate it.
---
The rep grind also killed any enjoyment of alts. You would occasionally have the desire to level up something that looked really fun.
---
The thought of having to start that rep grind over was always the end of that and I never had any alts in tbc and even when I played tbc private servers.
---
Because Gnome&lt;-&gt;Tauren deception is too funny to pass up.
---
that sounds like dirty aldor talk to me.
---
Yeah right click your character portrait
---
Belt so nice he wore it twice
---
But Naga are *aquatic*.
---
Mushroom
---
It's not like it's impossible to die or anything, but when I came back to the game and started a new character in Cata, I died for the first time at level 17. When I was leveling in vanilla, I'm pretty sure my death count was in the double digits before level 10. 
---
Part of it certainly comes down to having more experience with the game, but leveling really did get a lot easier. Pre-cata in a lot of areas mobs were more tightly packed, so that the human (or murloc...) running away might pull 4 more mobs instead of just 1.
---
Expect another news report in the coming months, only this time it'll be his wife crying.
---
Can't really test it while level and total RP are capped.
---
no thanks
---
I want you on my server at launch, in my party always, pointing out things like "huh, you ever notice how 66.7% of the male humans we pass have long cloaks? why is that?"
---
never stop sharing these thoughts.
---
Wow noob here, why specifically for rogues?
---
I know. I just completed your answer for the sake of people unfamiliar with classic, that there is no dungeon completion (the big xp bonus + lootbag) as may be used to from LFD, and added the reason why you can't complete LBRS quests.
---
Wow! Epic!
---
Tauren dont exist i guess.
---
Full disclosure I stopped playing after BC for personal reasons. Are you talking about changes made in WotL and later? Because I didn't find the Arena to homogenous at all. Much more rock paper scissors. And lots of interesting combos in 2v2/3v3
---
I forget the guild name, but a guild was banned for using engineering bombs on the Lich King’s platform, which made it so they could ignore a mechanic.
---
It was part of the game and not third party. They still got banned because they were exploiting. The same will happen to anyone who does what Chance did in WSG.
---
I expect millions of players
---
What bothers me is him popularizing it with an influential audience so that it becomes normalized. Either that or all the people thinking "well soda did it, it's not bannable," and get suspended once they do it on live servers.  
---
I think there is some responsibility that blizz or streamers need to take when broadcasting something to such a large audience without pointing out whether or not it's acceptable, even if it's a beta.  
---
To me, it wouldn't be fun at all to play a game like this even if I could get away with it.
---
I mean, I don't think that's true, but are you gonna really use "one picture with several hundred people on it" to imply it proves that's false? 
---
Cmon lol
---
Not useless. Intellect makes your weapon skills increase faster!
---
I'd wager warrior
---
Trolls = Hottest Females in the game from the ankles up.
---
Servers are an order of magnitude more powerful now compared to 2004. Ask any sysadmin. It's like a Mouse standing next to a Lion.
---
It should be 20energy ticks in vanilla regardless of level. Something is obviously bugged. Do you have any debuff or even Addons?
---
Top guilds will not bring retributions of course, they are hunting all the warriors. But most semi-hardcore guilds do accept retributions, if they prove themselves. Also, top guild is relevant to how the server does. There might be a server filled with casual guilds, and one of them eventually will come out on top. The most top guilds only bring 1 warlock for Curse of Elements, and bring around 25 warriors FYI.
---
Oh what?! Did they?
---
They can't do that for retail wow, the game is too far gone.
---
For Gnomeregan!
---
"X or Y?" "Yes."
---
I see your point. The player base is older and has less time to devote to such a difficult, intricate, time-consuming game. While those who are now the same age as Vanilla's player base was were born into a world where an ipad is glued to their face and they can quite literally buy in-game progression.
---
Hell yeah.
---
Issue:  I got 60+ Rage and Overpower just lit up from my Whirlwhind.  I'm rocking Deathbringer, but Flurry is activated.  Obviously I can spend my next GCD on Bloodthirst to burn some Rage and then dance over for the OP.
---
Do I have enough time to also get a Heroic Strike in after the BT before switching over for the Overpower so that I can maximize even more of that Rage?
---
Did the tank really think I was going to Thunder Clap while I was in Battle Stance, losing that 3% crit and 20 Rage?
---
Retail fixes nothing during beta. Why would we think Classic is some kind of superpower.
---
Mage invisibility wasn't vanilla. Did they have it in the beta, lose it, and gain it again? o_O
---
I do believe Intellect assisted with skill leveling of weapons? I haven't played WoW in forever but could be worth the Google!
---
Hahaha fatter poor dwarves
---
If winning Blizzcon doesn't make you good at the game, I'm not sure what would qualify.
---
Lul
---
There were streamers who ran to EPL to see if the entrance to Naxx was there, and nearly all of the NPCs hanging out in the Argent Dawn camp weren't there. I don't remember which ones were important to the quests/rewards, but it seems like things would be unavailable.
---
Not really. How is it better? Because you can level up higher? The player is still useless when Classic releases. I'd argue getting in on the fun of the lvl 30 meta, playing with a large group of english speaking streamers and others is much more fun than playing on a dying pserver with a lot of players who don't speak English.
---
ENTP, planning on rolling mage. Really cool to see how spot on this is.
---
Quests that you start in the barrens at level 20, like the spawn of Hakkar, culminated in the end game raid ZG. So many other examples like this, even in small scale at early levels like the Defias quest arc
---
Spell batching seems a little too much atm. I played a massive amount of WSG in vanilla and i never recall bugs like this.
---
The bloodvine set gives you a crit boost for wearing the entire set if you're a tailor. As a warlock the entire set is bis until Naxx, meaning you're losing out on +2% crit by dropping tailoring.
---
I wish there was transmog because a lot of the shit I'm gonna be wearing looks absolutely awful/retarded.
---
Depends how sweaty u wanna be. Moderate sweat I feel like is the most enjoyable but if your Drenched you will just get frustrated and salty
---
Your biggest DPS boost
---
On my priest I am going Tailoring + Enchanting to start with to make wands. Then I will drop Enchanting for herbalism I think to start getting herbs for alchemy on a alt.
---
Going to get Truefaith robe and bags with tailoring then drop it for engineering.
---
I guess I will keep herbalism as some bonus gold income + save gold on consumables.
---
I think you, as a warlock should go engineering + tailoring for ZG patch since you get +2% crit from bloodvine set, I don't feel like I need it. This is only for PVE tho, for PVP you can go whatever I think. Since bloodvine have no stamina.
---
Robe of the Void is the BoP robe you can make if you go tailoring.
---
I think the BoP items are the only "perks" of professions, like BS get a anti fear trinket I think + keys.
---
Engineering has its fun trinkets, cc helmet, explosives, net etc.
---
Tailoring have BoP robes + set bonus from bloodvine set.
---
Enchanting have a BoP tanking trinket.
---
But also they can be attacked from further away as well!
---
WotLK deserves better than this.
---
Tailors get a 2% crit bonus from wearing Bloodvine. It isn't just crafting yourself vs buying; by not being a tailor you get less of a benefit from the set.
---
You should bind that report bug keybind yo
---
I like that idea a lot more. I'm actually sad now that this isn't how it was in vanilla.
---
Is it possible that it's a spell that isn't landing, so it's only using some of the energy, giving you an uneven amount?
---
Holy shite this used to be the go-to video for learning GM commands for a private serv. GOOD TIMES!
---
Good that they found it, yeah... but is there a way to fix it with the way layering's done?
---
There's a good chance it won't run into that kind of problem on live servers, though, because people won't be getting together hundreds of level 1 or 2 characters into one spot in raid groups to do crazy stuff.  So depending on what the break point is, it *might* be okay... but that's something they should keep an eye on when it goes live.  This pointed out the potential for an issue, but doesn't confirm there is absolutely an issue.
---
Teehee
---
Same. I think most reasonable people and 90%+ of casuals would prefer a game being played as intended.
---
Does this mean being able to blink through the starting gate before the match begins is still doable? Anyone tested? 
---
I use to love getting into the enemy base before the game had started and throwing blizzards at the enemy.
---
winning what at blizzcon
---
be specific
---
Honestly I know there are a lot of people who are vehemently no changes, but I would love to see them add more content like this to Classic. Not entirely new things, but stuff that was planned and cut from the game.
---
if you're new don't minmax completely
---
In vanilla terms, 2% crit is a considerable boost.
---
Ion said it's necessary so it must be true!! 
---
There are other solutions, layering is just the way they decided to do it. If they cared about the community, they would implement dynamic respawns, launch with more servers and use queues.
---
That was some wholesome experiences, especially when it happened in stv on a pvp server!
---
I think the worst part of the evening "crash-every-10-seconds" period was the fact that it reset your game settings every time. I spent a good hour total setting my pet attack keybind and removing sticky targeting. But hey, I'd much rather have a crash-a-thon like that on stress test day versus release day!
---
Hi, I did some research in conjunction with a pserver dev on drop rates. 
---
I can confirm the bag drop rate on pservers is about 100x vanilla rates. The green drop rate is about 50x. 
---
If you get a bag or two on the way to 20 on beta you are doing well. 
---
On Joanna’s record run, his first bag drop was at 23 👍
---
Searing pain was the name I was looking for.  Yeah, but other classes generated just as much if not more threat than shadow bolt spam locks.
---
Without the crit bonus I believe the chest is still bis but the other parts are replaced by 2.5/AQ offset.
---
Indeed they did. It used to be pretty common for warriors to have an Int gear set to use whenever they acquired a new season they hadn't trained so that the could more quickly train the relevant weapon skill.
---
What you gonna tell me that all those people on the stress test will be playing classic for the next 2 years +?
---
Back in actual classic some 80% of players quit before they reached level 60. I was very explicit about the fact that I love classic but deducing from everyone wanting to check it out that it is gonna be long term successful is just fucking illogical.
---
No, I'm doing these tests while ONLY auto attacking from low energy.
---
I will be at lets say 10, then 30, then 50, then 71.
---
This is gold
---
Gnomes were part of the human race in WC2. Also, Gnomes were going to be their own race in WC3. So....
---
There are arguments against guild banks.  It furthers the RPG elements of the game and forces people being reliant on each other.  It forces you into trust relationships is an aspect that can lead to you forming long term friendships.  I was in two raiding guilds in vanilla, I know and still play games with the people who ran the guild bank in each guild.  
---
Automating such interactions with a guild bank is just a minor form of the damage done to community building that LFG/LFR did.
---
That's a fuckin blood elf my dude...
---
World of Warcraft Arena Global Finals 2012.
---
 [https://liquipedia.net/worldofwarcraft/Venruki](https://liquipedia.net/worldofwarcraft/Venruki)
---
Yes, but you won't get the extra crit without being a tailor
---
Yeah, I remember 2 hour queues, which would crash and boot you to the back of the queue.
---
I would rather just be allowed to play the game.
---
My guess is alliance will be the overpopulated faction overall. It will vary server to server thou.
---
But the reason why alliance will be higher pop is simple. Aesthetics. Alliance has all the “pretty races”. Horde didn’t start to match alliance population until blood elves came out. No blood elves means horde will be underpopulated IMO.
---
Sounds so awesome.
---
Yes, 20 energy per 2 seconds or so.
---
No debuffs or addons.
---
Every 5-10 seconds I will gain 1 energy while I'm simply just auto attacking.
---
It will go 10, then 30, then 50, then 71.
---
horde is objectively the best faction

woops
---
Yes TBC was still good but, that's because they were still figuring stuff out. You were only around for the tip of the spear. Chasing balance in arenas basically made it so multiple classes have mortal strike because you need it for arena. Then other classes started getting charges because again you need it for arena. Then dispels got stream lined because again everyone needs it for arena. 
---
As far as there being lots of interesting combos. That was true in 3v3. For 2v2 it was main stream Shadow priest lock then for the initiated it was double shockadin. You literally can't lose in 2v2 TBC with double shockadin. It has no bad match ups because the only double caster dps that was viable needed dots.
---
The warlock pet explodes into a million pieces with no cool downs vs. double shockadin then the warlock is easy  money. Then the priest just gets rolled.
---
Yes you could do this and more back in the day in all BGS. It use to be even easier for non druids.
---
I bet it will be him crying. He will of quit after WOD next to play wow again until he met a girl who never played classic.. the second she touches Classic shes addicted worse than him and its breaking up the fam jam
---
Gnome hunter...
---
Given thats not an option probably a dwarf hunter and will probably move with the map north to get to booty bay

Which is what it very well could be but it is a shame that blizzard hasn't helped us figure that out.  There are wow addicts out there like myself that HAVE to know these things to make their prebis lists :P
---
wrong, lmao. 
---
Not even sure how you could say that unironically, especially as a hunter, lmao.
---
&gt;wrath arena
---
dropped
---
If you plan on tanking you’re gonna want to pick up enchanting at least once for smoking heart of the mountain. You can drop it after.
---
Other than that I like herb/Alchemy or skin/lw on my druids.
---
This guy's pretty good. He's pretty small still though. I had narrowed it down to 3 classes then I watched his series and now I'm contemplating 3 entirely different classes......
---
Full hunter T3 is one of the worst sets they've ever made in this game.
---
[He reported it twice already.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/432058156?t=03h34m52s) Fucking pleb viewers.
---
Berserking's bonus in pve situations isn't overly substantial, and hunters tend to use crossbows for the bulk of their pve gear (although when using a weapon like Rhok'delar, you will notice a considerable improvement vs other hunters).

---
One of them is an NPC.
---
I did Dun Morogh twice, first as hunter 2nd on a warrior and it was noticeably faster the 2nd time. If you can optimize hiking around the zone you can save alot of time. Also knowing the best place to kill certain mobs.
---
I was able to get a good green axe for my warrior at 6 from my level 10 so that made an enormous difference. 
---
I actually think 1-10 hunter is really slow, but its way better when u get a 2h weapon training like around 6 or 8. I think you'll have to be level 10 during release to train new weapons tho.
---
Holy paladins are arguably the best pvp healers in Vanilla as well as being an essential component of every raid group.
---
Report it, it’s probably a left over artifact from the engine change to the old energy style. The demo had the new style of energy regen.
---
Savory Deviate Delight and noggenfogger elixirs are mandatory consumables for raids. Gordok ogre suit is mandatory for progression nights where you have a legit shot of killing a raid end boss.
---
imo its because it trivializes the raiding experience and part of wow is relating to what you and others have done. in a perfect world there'd be 3 difficulties. assuming lfr will never get removed, make lfr the difficulty of normal, normal the difficulty of heroic, and keep mythic the same while removing heroic.
---
So how was it? Laggy?
---
I mean its kinda easy to do that when most of all the other mmo's failed and after cata wow started going downhill really bad. Seeing how much hype this is bringing and how many people are interested as viewers on twitch and reddit and beyond those, wow may have more subs than ever when classic comes out. Its kind of stupid to say its not gonna have an affect on their sub count. It's like saying the fat kid outside of a bakery licking his lips pocket full of cash isn't gonna buy cake as soon as the shop opens.
---
Yea the binding disappeared when I bound F6 which are my mouse buttons.
---
Waiting for a console release. Seems like a game I'd rather play on my couch with a controller.
---
I am in the middle of the same change - going from a job when I travel away all week to one where I get home each day. Part of the new role will be requesting leave for launch week!
---
They changed that not long in. The only one you can enter with a raid is BRS now.
---
What I really miss was the identity that our items (armor, weapons, mounts, pets, enchants even) gave us. 
---
When someone walked into Stormwind wearing full Judgement and holding The Untamed Blade or something, that person was a badass. I knew he was a badass and I was genuinely envious- and impressed. 
---
I don’t get that with anything anymore.
---
Level with Skinning and Mining. Drop Skinning at 60 for Engineering. Drop Mining for Blacksmithing once you've stocked enough mats. Be a godlike Flag runner with Engineering items/trinkets and the [BOP Blacksmithing trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418).
---
Not quite. He stands as he gets hit. The mob crits him, but the server thinks he's stood up. So it proccs. It's not the same as sitting to get proccs, but it's (probably) not supposed to happen either.
---
Well, the first redshirt guy had an NPC:   [https://www.wowhead.com/npc=51596/wildhammer-fact-checker](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=51596/wildhammer-fact-checker)
---
Herbing on your main and having an alch alt isn't a terrible approach. 
---
Keep in mind Engineering is a massive goldsink, especially without mining.
---
He's actually very good , anyone with half a brain can see that so stop spreading lies. You KNOW you are lying. Or maybe you're retarded. Which is it?
---
It was always like this.
---
Played League for years since Beta. Haven't touched it in the past two+ years(Tahm Kench was last champ I remember) and loaded it up yesterday.
---
Seems like a completely different game now.
---
Might want to specify the private server part of Vanilla, not actual retail Vanilla.
---
You can definitely tank orange mobs, if you go in at 16 you'll be 17 before Van Cleef; that's plenty enough. Sure 18+ will take it from a little bit of a challenge with potential wipes to ez-mode.
---
Naga... naga...naganaworkhereanymore!
---
I liked all three although the changes in TBC were inevitable with a smaller world, a lot less cross zone questing. They also streamlined dungeons but they were still pretty hard. But I thought the multiple raids per tier were great.
---
WotLK was really easy to play, you start feeling like a juggernaut, but you still had a ton of character RPG building to do with huge talent tree and big money sinks with JC, Enchanting, and Inscription. They added the mount meta achieves. But they also intro'd LFG at the end.
---
It's still up, just crashing a ton
---
you don't need 8 warriors for  horseman you needed 8 warrior tanks! for it since you need spot to switch, so yeah trying to get 8 naxx ready tanks is pretty insane and a lot of poaching went on.
---
Either do only dungeons with heal spec or dps up to 60 then switch and farm healing gear.
---
A shame they only have 1 face (that people use)
---
nope im playing rn
---
It does, doesn't it? I want someone to man a reaaalllyyy old-school hardcore RPGMMO that is just nothing but flavor-based mechanics like this
---
I think it changes depending on class.  IIRC priest class quests are racial specific and have to go back to their starter capitals.  
---
I know some others, like human warriors are capable of doing their defensive stance quest in ironforge without returning to stormwind.
---
Oh boy grammar police!
---
Oh jeez I am dumb I totally misunderstood that
---
We killed him tank and spank style. Although the tank did die at the last 5%-10% but we were able to kite him after that. In a group before the one I killed him with we managed to die a lot. It was hard. 1 damage combo could kill the tank
---
If you have a dedicated tank with you, how much slower is leveling through dungeons in vanilla?
---
No idea, I'm not interested in playing completely broken emulations of a game so it's not something I follow. I would imagine it happened though since private servers are really shitty.
---
You'll be fine, I leveled prot during vanilla. I quested in a group of 2-3 and we could pull several mobs at once. We'd get quests done pretty quick.
---
I uploaded a video of it happening: https://clips.twitch.tv/HelplessCautiousMage4Head
---
I'd just go with a damage spec to help yourself solo/quest when you need to. You will still be a capable enough healer to heal dungeons while leveling regardless of spec.
---
Level as shadow spec and switch to a proper healing spec at 60, you won’t need a full on healing spec for leveling dungeons, they’re not insanely demanding until end-game.
---
You don't need to be specced heal to heal dungeons.
---
This is Classic, not retail. You are not pidgeon-holed into a narrow path. A feral druid still has his heals. So does a Shadowpriest. Both can heal any dungeon during leveling.
---
What, you think all these Warriors are specced prot? :D
---
Pick alliance for faster bg queues
---
I'll investigate. I did 10-man SFK in TBC because everyone in Silverpine Forest was too low level and we kept wiping.
---
It's all about progression though and Vanilla was around long enough...You also always had the option to continue experiencing what you wanted to experience even after BC released.
---
You can heal up to brd with dps spec so it's a nonissue
---
Holy can do damage just fine. Pop 5 in Wand spec and use HF/Smite/CoW
---
Grab improved Thorns for Druid, and Lightning shield for Shaman.
---
Who needs layering!?
---
Paladin for both variety and potency.
---
Played the most hardcore throughout Vanilla TBC and WotLK.
---
BC was my favorite because of my own experiences with friends but WoTLK was a fantastic expansion, I would say it's probably the best WoW has had.
---
the hype is real my guy.
---
Damn the poor addicts sure are getting scared of classic.
---
So many deflectors.
---
&gt;  launch with more servers and use queues.
---
And then what happens when the population plummets after 2 months and there are 30 servers each with only 500 players during peak?
---
**THAT** is what layer is meant to prevent. Dynamic spawns don't address that very real problem.
---
Now if only the male trolls had the shoulders of the Amani, they would be the sexiest males in the game.
---
Skip Outland, there is plenty of stuff on azeroth they could add. Like grim batol, hyjal, uldum, etc, but without the cataclysm stuff.
---
Its the strange unsaid social contracts we make that will keep the game alive. Its these accidental and unplanned parts that made the community the way ot was. 
---
Looking to live we hate people, no one knows your name beyond 'tank' or 'hunter', and everyone will just bail on you without a word, be rude and ask 'u need?' on any drop, etc. I always thought the gamers changed and we grew shitier.
---
It was the game that did it, not us. Its an interesting study in design and social interactions. I wouldnt doubt if Classic WoW is looked to when designing games goong forward.
---
You level as dps, you can still heal with your dps spec (maybe not as all classes, but as priest you can).
---
Respec cost increases each time up to 50g per respec, so you really don't want to respec unless you have to.
---
You don't want to solo quest as a healer either... You can ofcourse group up with a physical damage dealer (in vanilla wow a priest asked me if I wanted to lvl with her when I played warrior, made it easier for both of us)
---
Done and done! I gave them the video link too!
---
Where did you go? Sounds like a fun trip.
---
Nuclear weapons testing going on just over the horizon
---
A decent amount slower, and dungeons are much harder then they are now where you just blow through them in 20 mins. So it’s not very efficient either.
---
Clear as day, wtf.
---
Same bro, same!
---
Yea he got his.... BUT it was waaay later in cata .... And the intent ist to bring hin to Classic
---
For example: You don't want to judgement your seal just before the swing because then you wont have the GCD to apply seal again for the next auto-attack. There's plenty of similar examples.
---
In three months... Also classic wow is not equal to the beta. It's a very different and unique experience.
---
Yea, I reported the bug with the video link! Hopefully they get to the bottom of it!
---
Maybe they'll even be like "Hey this guy reports bugs... Let's give him beta!"
---
I know... I'm dreaming LOL!
---
I'm more partial to the Infinite Corruptor decimating everyone with shadowbolts.
---
You could make this into a Florida Man meme
---
Also why in Vanilla, slower tanking weapons where often times preferred, Less swings, = less chance to get parried. The ole "Wait for 4 sunders please"
---
I logged into the beta just now to try it out. 50 -&gt; 70 -&gt; 91. So yeah, definitely something fucky going on.
---
Dark Age of Camelot had 3 factions and it worked well. It allowed the weaker two to team up against the dominant faction instead of the dominant faction remaining dominant forever.
---
Played both...Druid was my very first class. Took me ages to reach 60. plus the begining without addons or any clue about the game. What I remember is that you will kill stuff slow but you will survive whole lot more than other class. 
---
About Paladin, played with BC and I think it's had a whole change so does not count.
---
You're not dumb, don't put yourself down like that! We all make tiny mistakes like that from time to time, it's really easy to think of one thing when the other thing sounds so similar! :)
---
Until exactly as you said here. It doesn’t matter because the level 30 meta goes away. So you play with a few popular streamers in beta. While it is cool that’s not what made vanilla fun. Even the streamers say the same thing. And I have partook in servers that were free. It’s fairly simple to find English speaking people and there’s hundreds if not thousands on every server. And no 30 meta is not going to be a thing when classic is released unless they break out the exp killer. Which is unlikely.
---
Druid: Stealth, dots, cat form, meld to cat stealth if it gets too tough, etc.. that said it’s not going to be great soloing with either.
---
is it too late for us to request that they add transmog vendors to vanilla? None of us want to look like colorful clowns
---
Subscriber count is a metric of how much a thing is enjoyed. Is it always true? Nope, The Avengers is massively successful while being an embarrassing cringefest. But in the case of WOTLK it's true. Classes were balanced, every role was mostly viable while not having been completly butchered and identical like it is now. Ulduar and ICC are the two best raids ever released. There was a good balance of investment and reward. The downfall happened when LFG was released, so in a way WOTLK was also marking the decline of WoW, but all in all it was a brilliant game.
---
That is a blatand lie.
---
People have been nerding out lvl 19 PvP Twinks, lvl 29 PvP Twinks, lvl x9 pvp twinks ever since ... well, ever.
---
Please don't pretend that this is somehow exciting, when the only reason for doing so, is that there is literally nothing else to do, with the beta levelcap ending at the exact point where the game starts becoming really interesting.
---
Both of these guys, and between them a huge Omar statue holding their shoulders
---
As long as you're choosing one as a Horde Warrior.
---
I really like the Stormwind banners! They look awesome!
---
You don't need to min max to have fun/ be successful in wow. Just read up on the classes/races and go with what sounds fun for you.

What the actual fuck. I did report it. Also sharing it on here for those interested in how this is developing. Why do you just jump in with assumptions and toxicity?
---
Rivendare's horse, undead horses, and all the PVP mounts included.
---
you're on a computer and you took a pic with your phone... what the fuck
---
Butthole move has definitely usurped the acronym
---
Ok do you have a source on it ? ...
---
What you gonna tell me that all those people on the stress test will be not playing?
---
:\^)
---
Dps is literally a fraction. Math doesn't change because you feel it should.
---
I'm going to make no assumptions here. First off, any number divided by 1 is itself. EG: 12/1 is 12 16/1 is 16 1239081230/1 is 1239081230. Dps is damage per second. Or in plainer terms, damage divided by seconds. Now to make things simpler let's say a fight lasts literally one second. 
---
Pop quiz. In this one second fight a rogue 25 damage, a warrior does 30 and a ret paladin does 50. How much damage per second does each person do?
---
Ok second pop quiz. A fight lasts 600 seconds. As discussed earlier damage per second is a fraction with damage being the numerator and seconds being the denominator. In this case the denominator is 600. 
---
If the rogue warrior and ret paladin do the same damage in the previous question, which one does the most dps? Which one does the least? Does the ordering of lowest to highest dps differ in this scenario compared to the first question asked?
---
These are no jokes, I am not being facetious and I actually want you to answer these questions because I don't think you actually understand how damage relates to dps.
---
If your entire point is that it can be RNG dependent then that's what the concept of an average is for and I don't know why you're trying to split hairs with damage vs dps. From everything I've seen, average ret paladin dps (over many raids) is lower than most other dps classes; it is no where near top 5. This goes for their total damage as well.
---
If your point is that someone died early in a fight I don't know what to tell you because that's just a weird what if scenario and literally who cares?
---
Probably druid. Pally is a better lowbie/aoe  dungeon farmer if you specifically build for it but that kinda gimps you in everything else. A normal resto/feral druid can solo things pretty well it just takes forever.
---
Mmm I'm not sure this is a fair way to describe what arena was/became. There was still plenty of rock/paper/scissors matchups in arena during TBC and WOTLK. There was not a ton of effort on Blizz's part to effectively balance around 2v2 (in fact, in later expansions they explicitly started balancing around 3v3, and even that wasn't given a ton of attention until late WOTLK). 
---
I don't think it's accurate to place the increase in class homogenization at the feet of arena either (after all, it's highly unpopular when compared to casual play or raiding).  In fact I'd say it would be the other way around - arena became a crap fest of pillar humping and insta ganks as the game devolved into everyone having interrupts, silences, escapes, and doing a billion damage all the time. 
---
I would also say it was the best way to see how good you actually were at the game. A true competitive (read: e-sports) mode in WoW. There's a reason why being a good arena player more or less guaranteed that you would be at least competent in a hardcore raiding environment (yes - I am aware that this is a large generalization, and I'm sure everyone has that one friend who was decent at arena but terrible at raiding, but I would say for the most part it's accurate enough), at least in TBC and WOTLK. Whereas the reverse was/is definitely not accurate - hardcore raiders rarely translate those skills into being competent arena players right off the bat.  Some say it is a different skill set all together and aren't comparable, which I'd partially agree with, but from personal experience, nothing WoW has to offer is as skill-intensive as earning a legitimate Gladiator title in a competitive region. You just couldn't replicate the kind of skill/knowledge you needed in arena in BGs (even rated ones) or raids, and for that reason I think it was quite an integral part of the game for the community at large. I'm not sure what 'instant gratification' had to do with it..there was nothing instant or easy about it.
---
I said the same thing the other day and was downvoted more than any other post Id ever made on Reddit.
---
A lot of people will flock to classic out of curiosity, but only about half of those that flock will remain.
---
Don’t let it discourage you from doing them though because they are really really fun.
---
I appreciate that thanks. Not gonna comment on reddit while falling asleep in future
---
Level as holy is actully not that bad.. Takes time just honestly not that bad. 
---
Go priest to heal, Then get 5 points in wand spec. Just Dot and want them down. you wont have any down time consistent just a bit slow. :)

Honestly, I think the perfect way to "fix" modern WoW would be:
---
1. Scale everything in the game so that even starting zone mobs wouldn't die to one hit from a max level character. Not saying they need to be challenging, but dieing instantly is too easy.
---
2. Introduce a system that utilizes materials from each expansion. Easy idea: player housing and a carpentry profession. Does this certain piece of furniture go perfect with your decor? It costs 200-linin, 50 bronze bars and 30 pieces of medium leather to make. Go get it, or go buy it.
---
3. Add events to each zone. Maybe it can tie into the above system. Want a jungle statue? Go complete this Troll Invasion event in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
4. (optional) Remove flying. Adding it was the worst decision Blizzard ever made.
---
Garrisons had some good ideas IMO, but they got lost because Blizz abandoned WoD a third of the way through. Remember how old bosses starting dropping music scrolls for the Garrison Jukebox? Imagine if say, suddenly the blueprints for some special item started dropping from ANY Naga mob? Or ones in a certain area?
---
The problem IMO is they lacked any REAL sort of customization and everyone's was so similar it didn't feel personal enough. "Which generic building would you like to plop down on a plot of land?
---
Does that work? I thought that came later. I'll have to look into it. Thanks!
---
There’s several of them in the works. The only question is how successful they’ll be and if it’s sustainable. The worst part of EQ was how group-centric it was and how long it could take to actually put a group together. You could easily spend half an hour just putting together a group to go questing. The Vah Shir has this crazy set of tunnels you had to go through just to get to the rest of Norrath and getting a group together for it was Not Optional.

I’ll give it to you that it’s unique because of the 30 cap. Fine that’s a reason to be upset you aren’t apart of what everyone who’s got a viewership is doing. 
---
I just don’t see the point of crying about it. It’s an unfinished game. The same thing has always bothered me about early released games or early access or whatever it’s called. People are paying to play an unfinished product.
---
haha :D
---
I can't see why they couldn't, all they'd have to do is scale down each of the zones to be level 60 content and then re-do just the numbers for each raid, hopefully turning them all in 40 man raids except kara which could be a 20 man raid. The problem remaining with that though, is that it's still completely separated from the rest of Azeroth, and there still wouldn't be a reason for a level 60 to leave outland other than going to a capital city. 
---
I'm perfectly happy with the level increase from 60-70 for TBC, what I really want from them is to remove flying mounts, remove welfare epics, and one or two other things that started moving the game in the wrong direction.

Dark age of Camelot had 3-way pvp and it was awesome.

I'm vanilla there were a zillion rogues, starting a group you'd get 10 asking for an invite. A rogue having a key gave them top priority!
---
Agreed. If anything BFA is an improvement over Legion but you can only improve so much on previously poor ideas. The only reason I am still playing is that I really enjoy the zones and story this expansion. I hated the space shit. I loved Warcraft because of the fantasy elements, not the interplanetary travel crap.
---
Sometimes beasts will have the looting icon/effect but when looted will have nothing and the option to loot will vanish. Is it a bug or feature? :)
---
No, I mean actual retail Vanilla. You could proc actual crits (as opposed to double damage "technically not crits") by getting hit while sitting up until about halfway through Vanilla, and then after they "fixed" that, you could still make the game recognize your double damage hit as an actual crit by standing precisely when you were being hit. [The game would recognize your character as standing, yet it would still force double damage onto you, and because you were standing it would read that as a crit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPEzEoexLI) This unintended functionality wasn't fixed until much later in the game's development.
---
It's a moot point anyway, because Classic isn't allowing this mechanic even with the sit/stand spam technique.
---
A lot of that subscriber count was just pre-release hype
---
It did grow during WotlK, but mostly it was from the solid base the previous two expansions had created + the insane amount of marketing and hype
---
Wrath was good and it was the best at some things but world feels very small and the pre Ulduar content is so boring and so easy
---
It was normalized in Vanilla even without streamers. All hardcore PvPers did this all the time. If the EFC was a tryhard walljumper you just sent your own walljumpers in to get him.
---
M Squad represent, this is the true Vanilla experience.
---
Buff crafted leveling gear and you make low level professions worth it in the same go!
---
Thank god
---
So /camp doesn’t work to teleport you out of the instance?
---
I applaud you for the effort. But in the end it's still "Add, Add, Add" and it doesn't tackle the potential problems it could bring.  Maybe if some day they want to make WoW 2, ill post that thread myself in the suggestions. But it's Classic Vanilla i want, and that isn't part of it, neither i want it to become.
---
It was a good read.
---
Thanks for the in depth reply
---
There is a Graveyard right in the middle of the zone. It's a smaller zone, and the GY is in the perfect spot.
---
always level as a dps spec do not listen to any1 else. you can heal leveling dungeons just fine as long as u have int gear
---
Incredible tank healers. Plus, Salv alone made them worth taking to a raid.
---
I'm in the same situation and decided on playing in EU (from eastern Canada). I tested some servers and pinged around 120ms which is fine since I mostly do PvE content.  The downside to this is my main retail account will not be activated when I sub, but I barely play it anyways.
---
Don’t do it. Those servers really suck. straight RP or straight Normal. 
---
On an RP-PVP, there’s no RP. If there is, it’s in goldshire if you catch my meaning, and if that’s your thing, the selection of potential partners is super low. 
---
On an RP-PVP server, progression is severely gimped. Most hardcore raiders won’t pick this server type, so you’re left with Thelma and Louise (played by Bob and Tom) who’ve spent more time in goldshire than trying to get their preraid bis. 
---
On an RP-PVP server, the PVP sucks. The TL;DR is that it’ll be low pop, bg que’s will be ass, and regardless of your faction standing, your contribution points will be much lower due to less faction wide contributions. 
---
That’ll leave you the lone PVP’er killing Thelma and Loiuse while you’re in blues and greens, and the game will laugh at you, and you’ll likely quit the game out of boredom. 
---
I can not stress this enough, play on a real server. You’ll be leagues happier.
---
pretty sure when the game was hard we had about 7 million subs, now you're lucky if you have 3.
---
the more the game got easier the less people played. Wow has had more players unsub than they have retained.
---
People dont like playing a game for 2 weeks and be done with it till next patch. the only thing to entertain you is transmog farming.
---
The argument of people have grown up and dont have time to commit is invalid. they can play as much as they can and progress slowly, always having something to do vs not having anything to do.
---
If you want to play the game you'll have time for it, I had  over 50 friends on my list from back in the day today none play. they werent kids either. They all quit cause the game was boring, watered down being to easy and not the opposite.
---
Stop it now. A man can only get so erect.
---
&gt;Yea the multiple spec balance really made raiding a pleasure.
---
Heroic SH gives me ptsd
---
This happened back in Vanilla - sometimes beasts could drop nothing, but they still had a "drop". I believe this caused a few issues with earlier databases (Thottbot and co.) when calculating drop rate, since they didn't handle empty drops properly.
---
Iirc this would happen when skinning back in the day
---
Hybrid specs
---
Not a bug, this happened in vanilla.
---
I'm the bottom left human of the "M" squad. It was a pleasure doing graffiti with you all.
---
It does, but an ele shaman wants less reach, not more.
---
That was the worst.
---
if you are grouping or have been grouping and the tiger has a quest item for another party member or former party member, it will show up for you like that.
---
but if that wasn't the case then I don't know
---
My guild was elated when we finished getting keyed for UBRS.  So much fun.
---
I never said it would be a thing on the live servers. My point is both pservers and beta are useless once Live Classic comes out. So there's probably a good number of people that would rather level and play on the Beta with the streamers and 99.9 percent of people who speak their language and on a REAL Blizzard server. It's not hard to understand why people would want to play a Classic Blizzard Server after 13 years.
---
Hey hey hey... that Dwarf M is putting his foot right in the testicle region... or shins for the taller ones. Great way to stop a spell cast.
---
" a mount that your specific character dedicated time and effort to get "
---
And then takes up a significant portion of your limited bag space, thus punishing you for every getting more then 1 mount. I earned my AV Wolf, I never bought it. Why? Bag space, I loved my Orange Riding raptor I got at lvl 46 cause I could FINNALLY afford it.  But the moment my green armored epic came into play. that orange one got tossed aside like a pet dog that got hit by a car.  I was sad to do it, but happy as heck to have the bag slot back.
---
Giant murlocs! With a saddle!
---
So an expansion was good because your class felt good to play?
---
Interesting logic. Each to their own.
---
Agreed, I'd love hybrid of the two featuring classic design philosophy and retail graphics and races with some balance.
---
... 1 sec let me just strap myself in for the downvote onslaught.
---
That would be amazing :o
---
The more obvious and likely explanation is that MMOs naturally attract INTJ and INTP types.
---
Any source for saying that a lot of the subscribers (that persisted through WOTLK and even GREW) was pre-release hype? Logically the subscriber count would have wnt to shit after release then. It didn't happen. Why?
---
ISTP, plan on playing Shadow Priest &amp; rogue (horde), pvping majority of the time.
---
It was fixed in vanilla. You could still get it to work in vanilla after the fix via the same method used in classic beta. The real question is if they’ll leave it or not as the fix was definitely meant to prevent forcing procs.
---
And this is what I’ll be doing with my Druid. Thank you lol
---
TFW you salve the tank on pull because it was your first raid ever and you mixed your key binds
---
I'd drop the feral points. It does nothing for you in PvE and only really any use in duelling in pvp. With 21 pts in resto you'll be a half decent healer in all PvE situations and more durable in PvP. Really your aim in pvp will be to stay 25-35 yards away from everyone all the time, keeping up IS/MF/Rejuv and coming in for wrath/starfire casts when you know you won't be attacked. Bear form just means you do 0 damage, are in melee range of people and use a ton of mana.  
---
As always the main problem with the spec is there isn't gear to support it outside of AQ40. So yeah have fun with that for phase 1-4.
---
But why?
---
that's an old problem - relogging will save your settings. Make your changes relog and then your setting are safe from random disconnects.
---
I did that as I played and decided it wasn't something I wanted to spend further time on.
---
cata launch was great though?? the difficulty of dungeons was increased and 3 raids on launch and reforging was ok i guess..  it was only after the most vocal part of the community, the casuals, complained that dungeons got shit on and soon after LFR was introduced. That's when i quit :/ tried to get back into it in MoP but just couldnt. Blizzard betrayed me and i will not soon forget that... omg classic?!?!?! zomg i need it gimme gimme gimme
---
As a rogue I always feel bad that I can't return the favor to them! :'(
---
I jump one time to show my thanks! :D
---
Is "Classic" before of after the shadowmeld change where starting a cast broke it? Aimed Shot + Shadowmeld was BS but also fun lol.
---
This is one of the videos that got me into playing WoW, back when I was a RuneScape addict
---
Also helps for crafting.
---
As a priest, I crapped myself the first time on this.  So much aggro.
---
Dw tanking will definitely not be viable in classic raids.
---
M for Masterpiece
---
If you kill two mobs and they both drop a quest item, but quest item from first one already finishes the quest, second mob will stay showing as lootable even if it doesnt show anything since you already finished the quest. This is feature. :P
---
Lit I'm the rogue with blue hair and red pants in the bottom left of the O
---
&gt; Pants and boots just don't make sense.
---
Like tauren/troll shoes and pretty much everything but helmets on Forsaken.
---
I miss Slabs.
---
pissed subscriber
---
have a friend who is a tank, or be in a guild. I levelled as prot war in vanilla with a healer other half. Later I switched to holy priest and yes, levelling was never solo.
---
O member here! Took us a while but we got there in the end
---
Pretty sure Protection is the true meme spec of Paladin in Vanilla.
---
I understand how DPS works, and why most people refer to it as the proper way of measuring damage, but your 600 seconds question is a question I'd rather ask on Retail, where most of the damage you deal is fixed (but even there it's not how it goes). Yes, if we go by what you proposed, the ret paladin Will deal the most damage, then the warrior, then the rogue. But, how the game actually Works is: rogues and warriors have consistent damage that they deal with adittional burst Windows (Recklessness + Death Wish, Adrenaline Rush+Thistle Tea), which is why they Will pretty much always have more DPS than a retribution paladin, especially warriors.
---
Retri is an RNG intensive DPS - there is a chance that every attack Will proc Ashbringer, your trinkets, SoC, all of that, and they Will all crit, at which point you are going to be THE best out there, but there is a chance that you'll only do non crit white hits. In reality, Ret DPS comes down to RNG. If there is a window where you have good rng, and then there is a window where you dont, and then put this on repeat, your DPS Will still come out quite low, and adding on top of that, you deal a lot of little damage, which also add to your DPS being quite low, BUT your damage dealt in the meantime is still quite up there, competing with the others. In reality, unless you are literally cursed, you are still very good damage dealt wise.
---
So in this case, yes, math is wrong. As I said, there are mechanics where you miss out on damage dealt, so at that point I understand why DPS comes into play rather than damage dealt.
---
I disagree with no level cap change though
---
Exactly, anything that can be used as a football by tauren is not a warrior.
---
I think that’s actually a thing in retail now, not too sure but I remember reading something about it. Sounds strange
---
Edit: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=114018/shroud-of-concealment
---
I used to solo the mini bosses on my shaman in Silithus.  The ones that you summoned with the clothes.
---
Druid is probably the best though.
---
Fyi the game became larger and more popular the easier they made things, peaking at wotlk. Just because the over vocal minority likes things hard doesn't mean the general populace does.
---
To be fair MoP had a lot of issues with too much cc, but had a lot of class fantasy and was fun. WoD solved some of the issues in pvp but ashran was shit and the top end of pvp was very, very unbalanced faction and composition wise
---
It adds to the nostalgia.
---
I mean, it still has it's uses for 5man tanking and aoe grinding :d
---
6'4" checking in. I don't really feel tall anymore post highschool lol.
---
Arena was a pillar hump fest from the start. I only really arenaed during tbc and that's why I quit pvp.  I would have loved to keep going with bgs but I couldn't get the best gear in those...
---
And everyone having a silence was 100% added in for arenas.  While class homogenization was not solely arenas (10 man raids were the other main culpret) it was a large part of it.
---
They'll certainly try it out. As for how long they stick around I said this:
---
&gt;It just means we can't know yet.
---
It may become wildly popular. Everyone who tries it absolutely loves it and draws their friends in. Retail dies and classic becomes so popular that it gets new content.
---
Or it will be majorly the private server crowd and a handful (couple thousand) newcomers that enjoy it, but it will be a niche product. In that case it will either die out a couple years down the road cause no new content or people will find a way to keep enjoying it for much longer despite no new content.
---
We don't know. They get to log in to a highly anticipated re-release and check it out when most people don't get to (no beta/stress test club). Can't expect every single one of those to like and stick with it.
---
Hell I played BfA Beta and dropped out a month after release (even though I bought a 3 month sub when it came out) because I didn't like it. By the logic you suggest (jokingly or seriously. I honestly cannot tell. I'm kinda tired and let's not kid ourselves, there are certainly people for both sides of the argument on reddit) my beta participation would have meant that I am a surefire long term BfA player.
---
Yeah, me curious.
---
Yeah I really wish they would have gone with the First/Second? War factions which would be humans, high elves, dwarves, and gnomes along with orcs, trolls, ogres, and goblins.
---
I don’t believe you.

The source of the information is a bonafide dev of a Pserver. I don't keep a file with every article or video I've ever seen. This isn't a grad paper. You'll have go find something yourself that supports your assumptions. I personally avoid those assumptions and stick with solid info.

Wirth's law says that software is getting slower at a higher rate than computers getting faster.

That is to say that the increases in computer speed have been largely offset by computer software being written less efficiently.

I love it when a warlock cast 10-min Unending Breath on me after I Fort them. You can practically feel them wishing they had a more useful buff to cast but they are trying and I appreciate that.

Should be nothing wrong with using bugs in a beta. It's up to blizzard to fix this or not. It's not up to the players nor is it their fault if it gets normalized.

This makes 0 sense. They for sure want a smaller hitbox, everyone does, but there is no reason to not want a longer reach.

I play retail since legion (don't shoot). It's actually pretty dope, and super OP in some situations. You stealth your raid members within 30 yards for 15 sec. 6 minute cd called 'Shroud of Concealment' . I like to use it in AB. Roll up to LM/BS with 10 people stealthed lol

I fall into that same category as the persons friends. I was in a hardcore raiding guild in classic and had server first bwl. I have essentially no desire to play classic. Some of the quality of life things wow has brought over the years i wouldnt want to lose. Classic to me will be nothing more than a "8.2 isnt out for another few weeks ill hop on classic wow while i wait" sort of thing. 
---
It seems like everyone assumes that the people who played vanilla all want classic wow and that just isnt the case. Does that mean i am against classic wow? No. Of thats what some people want and it makes them happy so be it.
---
Both healers and Tanks shouldn't have an issue running 5 man's before 60 as DPS spec.
---
I tanked as Arms while leveling in Vanilla and I healed as a Ret Pally while leveling as well.
---
They didn't use a 3rd party program, they modified a file in the game's folder, so nothing 3rd party was turned on for the Warden to pick up on. So by your logic, this ban was unfair.

Just a disclaimer that I love Transmog, but the reason why we have transmog now is because of how WoW has changed as a game from Vanilla. 
---
When WoW first launched we didn't have barbers to change how we looked, we didn't have old content we could just face roll for old gear and didn't have paid services which we could just change everything about our character in a whim.      
---
Your gear defined who your character was and I think that's one of the charms Classic has.    
---
I'm totally fine with Transmog in Retail and no Transmog in Classic.  There isn't much good looking gear in Vanilla part from Teir sets anyway.
---
Is that paid time off? Lol
---
No transmog or heirloom? The dream!

WTF is that character creation screen? LOL! Been playing since Retail release in 2004 and never seen a character creation screen like that! :D
---
I love Mara and hate BRD, go figure lol. I think it is mostly the setting and how you are forced to run it multiple times. That and a lot of the mechanics were buggy as shit. I literally never had a single run where the entire tavern room didn't aggro on us no matter what we did.
---
I think a big part of that is nostalgia, though. Nobody I knew liked BRD in retail vanilla or on p servers. The only place I've  ever seen it considered some great dungeon is this subreddit
---
R for Representin R squad!
---
Fair enough, after a point it can be really difficult to find bugs especially when you’ve completed a lot of the content in the beta.
---
Early alpha
---
No way. Pillsbury used to have those tiny circle pizzas that were way better than pizza pops. Now I can’t find them anywhere 😠
---
I was never "good" at leveling so I always did Teldrassil &gt;&gt; Elywnn Forest &gt;&gt; Westfall &gt;&gt; Darkshore &gt;&gt; Ashenvale &gt;&gt; and past that I do not recall. I really didn't want to miss story for the Night Elves so I always tried to do their zones but I also wanted a palamino for my night elf even though I never got it because I took too long :(
---
It's just a consequence of 10 being the max level - the game is supposed to convert any EXP you would get from a quest to gold when you hit max level, and I *believe* it does it proportionally to the required EXP to hit max level (may be wrong here, but it'd make sense so they could have it automatically update whenever a new level cap is added) - because the distance is so short from most quest's EXP reward and 10, the gold reward is very generous.
---
a part of me wants to believe that the devs know that classic will be a roaring success and hope to use the cultural shift to make changes to the retail game with a larger supporting audience.
---
Interesting. Do you think the game would work with more incremental changes to the level cap? Part of the issue I see with the normal expansion model is that to a level 70 everything at level 60 is useless. With small steps, at intervals, it might be more of a slow change.
---
Hey idk why people are shitting in you. I myself am playing a paladin for pvp I will be playing a mix of holy ret or ret holy idk yet. Can you elaborate on how to do burst end game?

I thought this dungeon was incredible and couldn't get enough of it, to the point where a big chunk of my 40-50 levelling on 2 characters was done here.
---
Perhaps I will tone it down a bit this time round, not sure :)
---
Damn I wanna know what quests he’s been doing
---
&gt; Also another point worth mentioning is that scripting will actually function correctly on classic, there's been plenty of issues with private servers where bosses aren't behaving correctly and using abilities as they should, which could really either be a buff or nerf depending on how it manifests.
---
Agree here. It can go both ways.
---
Yes.  A lot of them won't be playing.
---
The stress test is free.  Anyone could just jump in.  And when a streamer with nearly 100K people watching says, "Hey guys, make a character and come here," a lot of people will make a free character and go there, and be involved in a Twitch stream "event."  That doesn't even remotely mean they'll be there when it's live.  They certainly won't all congregate in the same place.
---
And thank Metzen a lot of these people won't be involved live!  Asmondgold and Esfand tried to level new characters after giving up because this mass broke the servers, and there was a mess of people following them, tagging mobs before they could, spamming Asmon, doing all kinds of stuff to troll and be disruptive.  It was impossible for them to do anything.  And you want to tell me that's going to be the live experience, that there's going to be a mess of people logging in for the sole purpose of just trolling a streamer?  They're going to pay $15 a month just to be useless morons?
---
Seriously, guys, no one's saying the game is going to fail.  But it's really pathetic and daft (at best) to act like these screenshots of a popular streamer collecting everyone possible in one place at the same time on a free test is somehow indicative of what the game's population will be like at launch.
---
I got there with a group as well but during the fight 2 people died and the servers crashed a lot 1 hour before serverdown. I could at least loot his heart.
---
Tank and hunter died really quickly but me (WL), a mage and a druid kited him to death.
---
"You think you do, but you don't."

So, retarded. Start telling the truth for a change, or at least don't lie. Be useful.

This is why i dont normally post to this subreddit. The people who frequent here are said vocal minority and disagree with you

Oh definitely! I'm drawn to meme specs anyways. I plan on leveling a Prot Paladin first so I can get a cheap mount to AoE farm on.
---
Then I'll roll my Warrior main and he'll have all the items and consumables he needs while leveling lol
---
Nah you just wanna roll on mine.

Classic wow is often about having 15 core players and 25 warm bodies. Yeah, gear helps a lot, but it hurts more when people are using your guild to get their ashkandi then dip.

Experienced raid leaders understand that a fight is less about having everyone geared and more about positioning and strategy. Clearly there are exceptions to this rule such as Huhuran, but NR gear is something that the individual has to spend their time to find.

---
Amplify that by a million when people see you reaping with your arcanite reaper and 0.5 dungeon set. Even just having Valor and arcanite reaper told people you were serious business.
---
Not gonna lie... This was about my peak ability.
---
Or we could pin this and let people discuss on it to prevent spam.
---
Swap TBC and vanilla and you're pretty much on the money.
---
TBC did the following:  
---
* Introduced flying mounts  
---
* Introduced "loot hallway" dungeons as the main dungeon design paradigm.  
---
* Introduced daily ~~chores~~ quests  
---
* Removed attunements (TBC _had_ attunements, but by 2.4, they'd all either been nerfed or removed completely.  Sunwell was the first major raid to not have an attunement and attunements never really came back after that, so TBC gets the dubious credit for killing them)  
---
* Reduced faction identity by giving Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans  
---
* Introduced resilience into PvP  
---
* Shrank the _de facto_ game world by consolidating virtually all of the end gameplay in the new, shiny zones.
---
It did a few things right (like Kara, which was actually slated to be released during vanilla, but I digress).  More than the other expansions.  Unfortunately, it introduced some _really_ shitty design decisions that have stuck with the game to this day.  Some of which are _particularly_ damning.  For that reason, it will always remain a distant 2nd place to vanilla in my mind.
---

We're talking about hitbox, which has nothing to do with spell casting range. You don't cast from the edge of your hitbox, you cast from the position of your character. The bigger hitbox just makes you an easier target for melee.
---
Does that make sense now?
---
All I'm saying is that people won't play if they're excluded from the lootpool. What's the point of raiding with these people then?
---
Hell, you can even heal brd, ubrs and even into raids as dps spec. It’ll just be a bit more sketch (especially late brd) than as heal spec.
---
I never really looked at it that way and I guess it makes sense when someone explains it to me. I always thought why would I want several characters devoted just for guild banking when I could have a guild Bank.
---
Agreed. Do the same for enchanting and just keep adding that way nothing feels stale at any point. 
---
I think it would be cool to try and keep everything on azeroth and just build the zones and quests up. New expacs, could feature revamped old zones with new areas that built up or built up main areas or destroyed areas based on the quests and you could design new ones around that. Add more dungeons and raids like they did with new expacs and just build while keeping level 60. Maybe the quest chains for new expacs could feature upgrades for tier 3 to build on it so it doesn't lose relevance until you get start the new dungeons and raids. If you don't have tier 3, maybe feature new armor sets, crafting recipes for armor sets and professions, as well as new stand alone gear. Giving you reason to do the new quests.
---
On the beta I find most everyone pleasant. On the stress test not so much
---
Either you guys have amazing memories, or I never experienced most of Vanilla WoW like I thought I did.
---
Druid, mark of the wild is the strongest buff and useful to every class.
---
Hah, I was just there. Awesome :)
---
ACKShually he ish the party
---
Situational, really. If you need the heal then definitely prioritize healing touch once you have them rooted. It can be useful to have a downrank or two of heal on your bar so you can minimize overhealing while doing this.
---
Also, rank 1 moonfire for totem stomping! I forgot to mention that above.
---
Wrath usage is questionable. If you're packing a lot of int on your gear, doing fine in the mana fight, and are generally in the lead pressure wise, it might not be bad. But if you went for a str/agi build it's not going to be worth the mana. And if you're wrathing, you might be able to starfire instead. Just make sure you kited out of shock range, and don't do it while they have grounding available.
---
In general you want to minimize the opportunities they're going to have to WF you while you're in cat, so make sure you're full energy when you engage so you can spam out some CP builders so you can let the rake/rip/moonfire damage do its work.
---
The argument works the same for level 10 20 30 etc content. It’s useless after you’re higher. 
---
I’d like new servers for new content. Leave Classic Vanilla where it ends so it’s permanently there. Eventually people will maybe move on to the newer servers, but there will always be at least one.
---
Had no idea what I was doing in when I started as a Warrior (first character too). Started playing early BC, so talent trees were the same in terms of leveling as classic. Went Arms because it sounded cool, and I yanked ALL dungeons. 
---
This is what makes Classic awesome; freedom. I’m going to create a Shaman and try my hand at healing and tanking. Hard to tank? Maybe. Part of the intent and design of the class to match Paladins? Yup. 
---
Can’t wait to explore it.
---
What about them? In the article, it specifically states "Saronite Bombs".
---
Engineering bombs did "siege" damage in Wrath of the Lich King, it was a new mechanic for building damage in battlegrounds like Wintergrasp and Isle of Conquest.
---
For whatever reason, Blizzard designed the platform with that new technology but did not make sure it was unaffected by siege damage. The guild exploited it to ignore the Val'kyr carry-off mechanic.
---
its been 5 minutes and servers arent down yet whats going on?
---
Well the people who don't like simplification or removing features would also be against removing the added features.
---
My layer tried, but we only managed to get an OMAB instead. Close enough
---
Really? It's been the complete opposite for me. What zones were you in? I leveled a Tauren this time around and we legitimately had amazing convos in General Chat. Everyone was either being friendly or funny. It made for an amazing discussion.
---
I got him on my Orc Hunt and obviously plan to get him again, but on a NE this time. I managed to get the white Horde quest spawn lion on an Alliance toon, so Human should be a breeze!!
---
Wand quest from BFD for my priest. :P Every dungeon tends to have some pretty great quest rewards for someone. Some probably still aren't worth doing cause there's almost as good stuff you get get elsewhere but you can't really sleep on any dungeon except like wailing caverns just because fuck that place imo haha.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/0Kw7jIH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0Kw7jIH.jpg)
---
Again, I'm not talking about mages at all. During TBC, or at least early on (I quit in the middle of it), playing anything other than affliction as a warlock was pointless. He stated that people weren't forced to play only 1 spec, but Warlocks were, just like Paladins and Shaman were forced to go  Holy/Resto in Vanilla. That's all I'm saying. I don't believe class or spec balance was appreciably better in TBC, only different.
---
Because somehow Blizzard, a AAA multi million dollar organization, convinced this "hurr durr no changes" subreddit that alternative phasing was necessary.
---
The crowd saying its a better alternative to server mergers is hilarious. There's now over 10 extremely questionable examples of how much of a disaster layering can be.
---
I'll never understand how the community quickly through away the most fundamental aspect of classic in a heart beat. Have fun phasing in between layers, having guildies in unknown zones, players exploiting resources, and not actually playing with all the people on the server.
---
This subreddit should be studied.
---
&gt; (and it was a shitty comment)
---
No, it wasn't.  A "shitty comment" would be one with any kind of malice or anything like that.  The guy just gave a response (which people boiled down to just one line) that he felt was accurate.  And there's a good chance it is.  Because even if WoW Classic gets 2M people playing it, that'll still be less than WoW Standard, suggesting that people don't want to deal with lack of things that were added or changed over the years.
---
Heck, just look at all of the "it's not a bug" stuff they've had to post, because people think the game's broken when it's working perfectly fine.  If Blizzard changes things or adds new content, then it still goes back to people not wanting the game exactly as it was.
---
Are you touched in the head? That statement was about finding bugs. 
---
Prime example was quin69 reporting starting zone items for having no stats. Exactly why people like that arent needed.
---
Reminding you to post, I am curious to see it
---
This bug only happened to me if the group spoke to the human before letting the goblin blow the door. I use to tell all groups don't do anything until the goblin blow the door.
---
Is this possible on horde? All these cool routes I've seen have been on Alliance so far.
---
I got it right at 40 or whenever you can wield it and it was better dps than my 2 hander. So I'd just rock sword and board with that wep til like 46 or something. It had a 1 hr duration but if you used it and logged out you'd have a fresh CD when you logged back in, giving you 2 hours of weapon time.
---
Druid for sure. Paladin's primarily a team player through and through. They're very slow on their own. 
---
Druid on the other hand is very quick, only somewhat behind Hunter and Warlock for general leveling speed once you get past level 20. Get cat speed in the feral tree and you're set. You could tank, DPS or heal dungeons just fine with that same spec too (I'd recommend 0/30/21 Heart of the Wild/Nature's Swiftness for starters). 
---
WPvP wise you can pick and choose your fights, there's no class better at escaping death than a Druid, and stealth obviously gives you a lot of mileage there.
---
And look at the background... the entire wall has the colors of the Barrens.
---
No one cares

The "exchange of buffs" paradigm sometimes backfires humorously. Was playing a warlock in either Badlands or Searing Gorge (forget the exact zone. Just remember it was a nice dry one). A priest came running by, tossed me a PW:Fortitude, and then just stood there. I was a bit confused, then eventually the priest said "Buff me". I shrugged and then gave the priest "Unending Breath". The priest still stood there and said "No, the other one." I was rather confused and asked "What one? I'm a warlock." Whereupon the priest said "Oops, thought you were a mage." and went on his way.
---
It's mostly people who either played Vanilla last time around when it was on Retail, or people who just read up all the guides and heard that ret pallies are shit, meanwhile all it was lacking is proper theorycrafting. I dont know. That is what I assume.  
---
I mean there is no such thing as a "burst" really in PvE, it's RNG intensive, however, if you can get a priest to put Power Infusion on you (I explained how to do it in the doc), you can do burst-like damage. For PvP however, you can certainly do good bursts: put SoC on, basicattack the enemy, stun, use judgment, refresh your SoC, use consecration, wait for another basic attack, time an engineering grenade to the end of the stun, basicattack again and judgment. Again, it's a bit RNG, but it's there.  
---
For PvE, to maximize your damage: only use Judgment of the Crusader on long fights, and use your mana efficiently - ideally, you try to empty your mana pool as soon as the boss / tough mob dies. It comes with practice - I went onto this a bit in the doc.  
---
The classes that counter us are: warlocks, priests and druids that stay at 30 yards, dot and run away. However, engineering can help a lot against these. The classes that you absolutely counter are: rogues and mages. Against the rest, you are decent, but you can lose to them.
---
If you got more questions, I have linked my private Discord server in the doc, so you can ask there. Otherwise, just comment here and I'll try to reply asap :)
---
Those things are not the same at all. The cap is 30. No one in normal release stops at 30 and tries to min max to clear SM Catherdral. There's a reason the streams are  popular, and that's because it's interesting and unique. A large majority not being able to play certainly contributes to the viewership, but still. 
---
Why do you care if people want to get in the beta? I didn't get in, and it doesn't matter to me. Yet you don't see me trying to argue that people who want to play it are somehow wrong. The 30 meta where everyone is 30 will not exist once Classic comes out. That by itself makes it intriguing.
---
You don't need to put a single point in healing talents to heal dungeons. Just put on healing gear.
---
Yep in vanilla pretty much whole world is relevant. Everything in it is a part of the whole experience.
---
Yea horde does lines around the org AH, I'm so glad there won't be mammoths in classic, I'll be able to find mailboxes again.
---
How bad was it? All these comments and no ones mentioning how smooth it was. How was the whole thing with that much people?
---
Fastest leveling for a warrior is fury until lvl 40 then switching to MS cookie cutter build  as it is the highest damage- After getting your BiS gear from 60 dungeons you can go a hybrid tanking build for most the raids unless you are the MT. thunderclap was never in my rotation in classic- was a OT in my guild through MC-BWL-AQ and into the first few bosses of naxx- didnt go full prot until naxx

I wish, at my job this year we have set vacation rotations with 4 weeks in 2 groups of 2. My 4 weeks end the week before classic comes... :/

Here's a clip of this happening in the open world: [https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpAbnegateHyenaDoritosChip](https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpAbnegateHyenaDoritosChip)
---
Definitely a bug.
---
What if Blizzard would just watch and study what players do in classic and which parts were success. Then recreate and follow the game philosophies in a new actually good game and leave classic how it is.
---
Bones of transformation.
---
There was an item that morphed you into a naga for a few seconds, that was probably that.
---
Invite to party, cast battle shout, leave. Open trade, give them Mana pot, /bow.
---
Dynamic respawn have nothing to do with layering.. And we're in Vanilla.. Hello? Also... This circle jerk about "starting zone chaos" justifying an alternative version of phasing is hilarious. Let's fuck the most crucial phase of vanilla community development so Blizzard can spend less money.
---
If I ended up on a dead server and was given a free transfer I'd say thank you and forget about it 5 seconds later, instead I'm going to be given the most anti community garbage I've ever seen aside from phasing. #nochanges
---
Yes they persisted through wrath and did indeed grow some 2 million but it's not that impressive considering Vanilla started at like 200,000 and ended at 6 million. If growth is how you measure success vanilla did that best.
---
Not sure why I would need to provide a source that tells you all the subscribers at the very start of wrath are either pre-existing ones from the previous games or new players who say the marketing, that is just common sense.
---
But all of this stuff is covered in countless articles and youtube videos, it's not an obscure medical journal, you can look it up yourself if you care that much.
---
Well I did it anyway for you, here you [go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/)
---
As you can see growth basically stopped during wrath and was explosive during the previous two expansions. Make from that what you will.
---
This whole trend of asking people "do you have a source" for something that takes 10 seconds to google is very annoying.
---
Hey, I found myself!
---
Can't do anything in Org since the world keeps going down every 2 minutes
---
Oh lord lol
---
"Well loved" is such a strong term...  I'd say "less hated" would be more accurate.
---
Absolutely true. We need more horde warriors, and shamans!
---
probably getting a lot of good data from all the disconnects
---
The priest trick of Mind Control followed by PW:Fort could only happen on a PvP server. And don't get pedantic about those weird individuals who flag themselves for PvP on PvE servers. They are a definitely strange edge case.
---
And yes, when I played a priest, I too would mind fuck 'em by using Mind Control followed by PW:Fort. But more than a few would simply see their health bar get smaller and immediately think that they have been attacked instead of buffed.
---
13min passed and it's still up
---
Pretty much.  People were jumping, but eventually the game's lag hit so bad that it didn't show people moving until they were moving larger distances, at which point it looked like they were teleporting.
---
Then this mass tried to leave the gates to head for Stranglethorn... and the server promptly died a hideous death (again).
---
Sounds stupid
---
Please learn English
---
I think you can check out guides for whatever class you choose, but don’t choose your class based of it fitting some meta. Just play what you want to play, then once you’re leveled up you can start to focus on precise gear and more if that’s the route you want to take. If you like being competitive, you’ll undoubtedly learn ways to be competitive as you make your way to 60 and carry those ideas into end game. Stoked for ya dude, limited knowledge means everything being new and fresh. It’ll be a great time, see ya out there.
---
I don't expect it to be very popular week one haha.
---
the DPS just have a higher threat ceiling and tank healing isn't an issue, so you do it because it's a large boost to raid DPS.
---
Steps to reproduce:
---
1) Start casting a heal 
---
2) spam drink before the cast completes
---
3) You will begin drinking before you're placed into combat from the heal. 
---
Note that this isn't a bug report, the mechanic is an intended side effect of spell batching and has been commonly referred to as "drink bug" since tbc arena where it was heavily utilized by healers since they could frequently drop combat throughout the match.
---
Open lockboxes
---
Everyone was exploiting all the time like this, wsg was like this from the start.
---
I do think these extreme exploits should be removed but keep the normal ones
---
Project gorgon
---
The first thing that came to my mind was how did you get level 36 on the beta before I realized you mean your age. I should playing this game until release maybe.
---
Yes, relogging to save progress from rollbacks is 100% the way to go!
---
hahah :D yeah I'll be honest I only use prot for grinding too. I've no affinity or love for tanking so I never theorycrafted if it actually could be viable in raiding. However, if you want a good farming alt, there is a list of items that I talked about in the doc.
---
*"There are two ways to farm gold effectively: log in during downtime hours to farm Arcane Crystals, or the other way is AoE grinding by speccing Protection. Leech T1 gear from Molten Core for the 8 set bonus for maximum efficiency, and just build Thorns damage (Essence of Pure Flame, Shield Spike, Improved Retribution Aura, Blessing of Sanctuary, Drillborer Disk). Paladin is an expensive class, so be prepared. Even if you don’t want to switch talents, AoE grinding is still possible. But, if you do want to change talents, this should be your talents:* [*https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AswQBD8DrEADPJMP*](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AswQBD8DrEADPJMP)  *You can also use this spec to tank 5 mans."*
---
The point is that slithering around in a serpentine fashion is a very efficient method of locomotion as demonstrated by the many snakes that can outrun you.
---
Being aquatic is irrelevant. Snakes are just as good at swimming as they are on land.
---
Ever play EQ2?  I thought it was cool that you could betray your faction and be in limbo until you finished a huge quest to join the other faction.  And it was permanent!
---
More bullshittery from you jesus. I didn't make any assumptions that is what you did. You assume that because private servers are inaccurate that it has to be easier.
---
Engineering Grenades sometimes do nothing. [https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpAbnegateHyenaDoritosChip](https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpAbnegateHyenaDoritosChip) Almost looks like it falls through the ground.
---
People liken vanilla, TBC, and WotLK to each of the original Star Wars films, respectively.
---
RotJ is usually viewed as the weakest of the three, but still much better than anything that came after.

Back when vanilla was original this is where I thought blizzard would go with wow before they announced tbc

&gt; And you want to tell me that's going to be the live experience, that there's going to be a mess of people logging in for the sole purpose of just trolling a streamer?  They're going to pay $15 a month just to be useless morons?
---
You underestimate how much people like to be assholes online. People in beta already have subs. They're already paying and they'll happily continue to pay.
---
To be fair so did Venruki. I thought both players played very well.
---
Ogres apparently got the furthest in Vanilla's development. They were able to use some of that work for the Gordok Ogre suit in Diremaul.
---
I would do the opposite. Had a macro that examined the level of the target and cast the highest rank of PW:Fort that the target could receive. Before I wrote the macro was simply key binding my highest rank of PW:Fort and kept getting annoyed at getting an error message whenever I tried to buff a lowbie.
---
Night Elfs are Trolls...
---
If your value on an expansion is based on a raid then you are not qualified to express your useless opinion.
---
Just experience with betas these days.  Issues like these often remain unfixed. Im fairly sure it will suck for as long as the system is in game.

Hey thanks for the fast response. Ok I figured as much. Considering most of the pop will be rogues and mages I’m confident with ret pally lol. Do warrs smash our faces in 1v1? I think you missed this one and hunters also errr nm I see it lol. Thanks for the info I didn’t see a doc but I was just clicking in the picture that was linked. It looked like part of a doc. I appreciate this though! Tyvm warrior of light! See you in Azeroth.
---
I will agree with you that humans are severely flawed when it comes to favoring other humans, and that this can definitely cause problems, however, if a person understands WoW and wants to make a difference for a guild, they will see loot council as a means to an end, that end being better raid progression in the long run.  
---
This system tends to only work for the top 1% of guilds because of exactly what you described, but statistically speaking it is the best system for guilds that are stable enough to pull it off.
---
Well played sir
---
Beta is to find and report bugs, not find them and use them over and over to your advantage.
---
True.. I could possibly take mining and engi, and go herbalism/alch on my alt. Just not sure how far behind my alt is going to be
---
And omar is here  
---

---
It worked, he showed up!
---
Ahhh i see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I think I said something like "it's all Alien VS predator with this bitch."
---
Why did all the existing players and new players who bought in just by habit and nothing else, keep paying the subscription? Because they were lazy obv and didn't really like the game, they just didn't have the time to quit. Fair enough.
---
Why did they quit in cataclysm then?
---
Yeah but you could see a Tauren wearing pants and shoes. Like that makes sense, they have feet and legs.
---
How the fuck does that function for a Naga?
---
Also forsaken can and do use everything, it just gets some invisibility applied to the textures on Forsaken for flavour.
---
It's quite possible I am remembering this incorrectly as it was over a decade ago.
---
However I have a strong feeling it was considered to be 8.6 or 9% in Vanilla and then in TBC there was a big discussion on EJ as people started noticing they weren't missing at all with 8% hit as physical DPS. This went on for at least a few weeks with people saying you need millions of parses to prove this true or not, till eventually it was just accepted as correct.
---
The main reason it stands out in my mind is because I thought it was amusing that almost out of nowhere people kinda went "this thing we have accepted as true, just isn't" but I think it was unclear if it was ever changed or just incorrectly calculated by the community in the first place.
---
&gt; And when a streamer with nearly 100K people watching says, "Hey guys, make a character and come here," a lot of people will make a free character and go there
---
The stress test is invite-only, you can't just join it at will.
---
Think before posting.
---
Go to goldshire, type /yell “who thinks they can beat me in a duel.”
---
Then it’ll start.
---
Seriously though, I have no idea.
---
The majority of vanilla players never raided though, so using raids as an example isn't really helping your arguement.  A larger percentage of players today raid in comparison to vanilla.
---
Event for Alliance again?
---
Wewlad
---
I love how people repeat it and show how out of touch they are with reality.
---
First, it's a partial quote, and the whole context is still accurate for the majority of players.  A small minority doesn't make the quote wrong.
---
Second, you're trying to act like an image from a stress test that cost nothing where a popular streamer asked people to log in, make characters, go to a specific spot, and engage in an "event" (best word I can think of for it, I think it fits), is somehow indicative of how many of those people will actually play the live game.
---
If this is indicative of the live game, then the people later being trolling asshats is also indicative that WoW Classic will have a lot of trolling asshats who do their best to disrupt other people's gameplay.  Do you believe that's accurate?  If not, then how can you make any other claim about the live launch related to this stress test?
---
I mean, FFS, these people aren't even playing the game.  They aren't trying to level, they aren't exploring the world, they're there to follow one man.  That's it.  So the WoW Classic experience that everyone wanted was actually to just log in and follow some guy as he leads them somewhere and not actually play the bloody game?  Okay, so you're saying Blizzard was still right.
---
Context for an image is important.  When you decide to ignore context, you're "out of touch" with the reality of the situation.  People are ignoring what's happening to create a false narrative to push their own views.
---
More than weapon skills, more than having to manually group and go to dungeons, more than anything else, that ridiculous attitude is what's going to hurt WoW Classic.  People who are so stuck in their own sense of superiority and view of reality that they'll pretend something is what it isn't and then argue against and downvote anyone who presents the actual reality.
---
Just freaking enjoy the game and stop trying to bash Blizzard.  It's not clever anymore, it's just tiring.  If you really did want WoW Classic, then there's no reason to keep acting like Blizzard's evil and all, since they're giving it to people.  If Blizzard doing that was wrong, then, again, the quote was right.
---
A significant portion of the playerbase. And layering is almost certainly going to be used for more than a week. No idea where this 1 week meme is from. They've mentionned it could be until phase 2, so potentially months which would've terrible consequences.
---
thanks lol
---
I disagree, upvote for being polite about it tho.
---
OK, I'll try. No promises though
---
Bullcrap I use feint when the tank sucks
---
let retail be retail and classic be classic

and let the players choose what to play

&gt; working with a Chinese developer is likely one of the only ways to do so legally.

It helps get around a lot of issues with trying to break into that market.
---
I get the feeling that the amount of people telling people to calm down is larger than the amount of people currently not in a state of calm.
---
They summoned OMAR!
---
For me it was a couple things.  First I want to say that I loved the basic nature of the content in the story, etc.  However, I feel that they added systems that, ultimately, ended up being detrimental to the game.
---

---
LFG finally destroyed any of the last vestiges of community that existed in WoW.  Server transfers went a long way to doing this, but that had a monetary cost as opposed to time investment of rerolling on a server so it was an easy out for people who saw the time investment of leveling to be more costly, though costly.  LFG doubled down on that and made everyone anonymous.  When you can be a dick to others and have no repercussions, asshats will be asshats.
---
The multiple tiers of difficulty for raids meant that you saw the same raid over and over and over and over again.  Don't get me wrong, I loved ICC.  What I didn't love was doing on mains twice, then on alts and then again on secondary alts to gear up and plug holes in the raid comp when we couldn't find people.  All that meant seeing the same content way to much.  The length between content updates also really seemed to be really long.  I'm not sure if that was because I was just done with it, but I recall that either the wait for ICC was insanely long or ICC was there for way to long and they needed another raid.
---
Gearscore.  Fuck GS.  Granted, IIRC, this one isn't on Blizzard, but it occurred during WotLK.  It took the toxicity of WoW amped up by the shit sandwich of LFG and added a side of vomit soup.
---
Acheivments basically turned everything in to a dick measuring contest.  Couple this with the aforementioned community asshatery and the level of toxicity was just out of control
---
So yes, while I do love the base level content of WotLK, there was a lot of things that happened during the expansion that were both the fault of Blizzard and the community that soured the entire expansion for me.  Looking back on it now, I really equate WotLK to the game being in it's teenage years.  The innocence of the game was gone.  I started playing vanilla when I was 24 so it wasn't even that I remember it fondly from my youth.  For me, TBC was the height of the game regardless of sub numbers.
---
It’s a rave, concert or a festival!
---
All I wanted as a kid was a game the I could grind away in to kill boredom. I didn't know about Runescape and had a copy of Final Fantasy X on PS2. Looked cool, but I just wasn't a fan of that series and knew it had an eventual ending.
---
Wish I knew about WoW when it came out. Although I don't think I would have had the money to play it.
---
Ah yes.. And get the Outfitter addon to manage that trinket. Ya mount up and the least useful combat trinket gets swapped out for the carrot. And when you dismount, the carrot gets swapped out for the combat trinket. Best of both worlds.
---
how so?
---
Against warriors it's RNG, but you have consistent tools that help you against warriors, especially if you have consumables and engineering. Hunters, it's all about if you can get aggro on the pet with a Quick Righteous fury boosted judgment. If you cant do that, you still have a decent chance because of your kit. And no problem mate, I'm glad I could help :)

Anyone else think the concept art looks like Zoolander? Even has the same pose LOL

---
&gt; Why did they quit in cataclysm then?
---
I think you know the answer to this, lol
---
IDK, ask the healers.
---
When you notice afterwards that someone buffed you and you look around and they're already gone "NOOOOO"
---
Slippery Fish.
---
Also their other racials should be, Tips the Scales (a single target armour debuff), Salmon Slam (aoe stun like Tauren), and Sardine Slap (a chance on hit to do a minor stun).
---
Herb/alch or mining/engi. Mining/engi is super nice for pvp and jumper cables. Herb/alch is great for potions and buffs but also allows you to collect your own Swiftthistle and fadeleaf, both reagents rogues need.
---
Of course skin/lw is ok as well, definitely in the backseat compared to the other two though.
---
Trolls don't need shoes, they're literally too perfect for shoes
---
The thing I was arguing against was that you'd change your playstyle because your opponent might have a 5+/8 set bonus, that's just not feasible.
---
I completely agree that identifying gear can be crucial when it comes to stats (aka how geared they are) and unique items like edward the odd. But the guy I was responding to was solely bringing up set bonuses that all requires 5+ and you can't really verify that just by looking at gear.
---
&gt;Besides all that, making your gear more than a bit of data gets you attached to it. It's not some look you choose from a fashion magazine, it's your look, and when it improves your happiness spikes considerably.
---
That's where I stand too, but as I said, it's not what I was responding to.
---
Just a heads up, [I made more emojis for dungeons.](https://imgur.com/a/od4Ov88)
---
Sorry man. I want to believe you as I play dry paladin myself. But dps is the same as total damage just divided. You could change the denominator and make it per minute, per hour, etc. and it will always tell you that total damage is no different.
---
Dude the problem with shaman tanks is no taunt or threat control.
---
Por la Gorda
---
That's one thing I don't like about playing as a Shaman. You got no buffs, so you can't buff people, and it's also rarer that you get buffs yourself because you have nothing to trade.
---
Sadly no, the addons loaded but ran without collecting any data at all. I havent had any time to try and figure out what I have done wrong :(
---
*pushes up glasses*
---
**Actually**, night elves average 7ft in height.
---
It is sort of like paying it forward except the newly buffed individuals do not feel contractually obligated to do it to others, they seek out their next buff recipient like a quest
---
So most of what you said I agree with. From a tech and pace standpoint vanilla is a different beast from a different age. Either they will love it or hate it. But one thing vanilla has that is vastly better then retail is a community and social structure. If retail could figure a way to do both that would be the best I’m interested to see where it will go. I also do not agree it will be a few months of popularity then gone. People played for over a year before tbc and most did not quit numbers only rose. The retention was kept by this social chatter box called a community. Where things get interesting is after 1+ years of classic where does blizz go with it. That’s the true question. Lessons learned runescape didn’t abandon new and it pretty evenly populated with each side preferring different play styles
---
Or reading a random gray-loot tablet that drops in ZF and realize that it points you to an actual place and an actual item. So you travel to the other side of the planet and get the mallet and then come back and then you kill a fucking hydra thingy that lives in a relatively shallow pool.
---
Cheers, thought skin/lw was the obvious choice, but seen so many streamers roll with mining/engi. Just how hard is engi to max?
---
Yes, getting keys was a very importation thing. Although the number of people who didn't bother was also annoying. It was appalling how many players never bothered to get the Shadowforge Key. But then again, how many people noticed the ghost you needed to talk to in order to start the quest chain for that key? And because of the way the quest chain was structured, the quest was unsharable.
---
I tried. It was certainly more solo-friendly than the original, but I couldn’t get over the movement animations. And it was still hella grindy in a world that had moved past that playstyle.
---
Too bad about EQ Next. It could have been interesting.

Yes, because they enjoyed WOTLK and didn't just subscribe because of pre-release hype like you claimed. They were subscribed because it was the peak of Wow. They didn't enjoy Cata (because it was shit) and then unsubbed. It's not rocket science. You're the one claiming otherwise.
---
Oh no, a developer guy made a comment that wasn't a PR-approved soundbite!  Let's act like the whole company's got their heads up their asses!

Seriously, the guy's not a PR guy.  At the moment, he's probably thinking people are acting like they can't play this game, and that makes it crap and all, and he just blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.
---
I don't feel like playing Diablo Immortal, I'd like a Diablo IV, but I'm still in touch with reality and know that Immortal doesn't mean IV won't happen (or even that it's not being planned/worked on at the same time), it's a Blizzard game so the right place to announce it is at BLIZZCon (not PCCon or PERSONALCOMPUTERCon), and ultimately if I'm not interested I can just ignore it and I'm not harmed for it at all.
---
But people want to be victims so bad they'll find some excuse to be offended and outraged so they can play a victim.  It's just so tiring.

I was tanking in a group with a hunter that refused to turn off Aspect of the Pack on a private server. People kept telling him to turn it off, but he refused to listen. Result was that I was constantly dazed. Luckily I had Feral Charge, which let me move quickly when others gt the aggro. But it was really annoying.

Hi, /u/Baimu91
---
How do you walk in lieu of running? How did I make it thru vanilla and two expansions and not know how to do this?
---
Maybe its a lot of people like Asmongold Roleplaying having hair.
---
Hi, /u/Ko0zi
---
it seems like its not scripted very well at the moment and doesn't discriminate whether or not players are in combat.
---
I think one of the issues is its trying to move players to a different layer and them moving as a group is a Valid option, regardless of combat, etc.
---
Ultimately they should put players in Layers and keep them there.
---
Players coming out of instances or whatever can be shuffled into lower population layers, and players that logged into that layer should stay in that layer, if you invite a player into your party they should be-able to join you in your layer.  
---
I don't see why they don't just make it more transparent, don't give a drop down menu like Guild wars 1/F2P Korean MMO's to switch layers, but just give players the control to not be moved between layers without their consent.
---
!thesaurizethis
---
While you are right. Just wanted to note that even if it procced per every mob hit it would not mean you have 100% when hitting 10 mobs.  It means ever mob have 10% chance to clear cast which does not equall to every mob adding 10% to clearcast happening .  Dont know the math , but im sure it would give very different result.

This is really a Gordian communicate. Is it because this specialised hairstyle plainly looking ats the hot and modes the game/lore? Or is it because all the other hairstyles are impartial bad and don't make for? I intend it's a variety of some, but the second is the outsized intellect general.

Small indefinite quantity is existent nasty to do in wagers, it is one of the well-nigh arbitrarily behaving somatic disapproves on our embodies which has a particular 'action' work out to it.

I've played all expansions except panda and bfa and BC, imo, was the best one overall.  It's classic enough still that most things that are great about classic are still part of the game - but a lot of classes get much needed love and gear.
---
The one downside of BC over classic on it's own is that the endgame is all flying mounts so world pvp is reduced.  
---
My person perfect server would be a BC server but with an outland with flying disabled even at 70, and flying accessible only areas modified to allow access via land mounts.  Also no disabling of attunements for raids.

Hi, /u/FishingTauren, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
there is another layer with tons more people on yet goes to the streamer layer 
---
:(
---
&gt; Mage invisibility wasn't vanilla.  
---
I'm not talking about release.  
---
&gt;  Did they have it in the beta, lose it, and gain it again? o\_O 
---
Seems to be what happened.
---
[update, shit fell apart, then it got even crazier..](https://gfycat.com/FavoriteWanBudgie)
---
The nice thing for Blizzard is they have a year or two of content mostly made already. 
---
They have a lot of time to figure out what they want to do.
---
you see though I don't want her back and I wasn't exactly "cool" for playing wow in the 2000s.
---
i'm pretty sure the nochanges crowd is actually the normal here bud. The proof is in the pudding... i mean upvotes
---
You should have let the hyena aggro on him while you dueled him, killed him, tea bagged his corpse, and told him he wasn't worthy.
---
And just store all mats as I progress?
---
Classic Wow might be one of the cheapest hobbies ever created. $.50 per day for unlimited fun things to do. What am I going to take a girl to the movies? $25 for two hours??? I wouldn't even get loot!

I just /ty as a Warlock. Probably give out Unending Breath once I get it.
---
Yeah i could see BOK competing.
---
Every time it comes up I recommend putting one together yourself. You leave a bit just trying.
---
It’s what I plan on doing yeah. This way you can just keep leveling and not worry about profession either
---
Wouldn't you rather deal with that for a few days than to have what may well end up being permanent sharding and immersion-breaking bugs?
---
Well I forgot how I did it but I definitely buffed people using mind control
---
Still never understood why things like mailboxes didn't and still don't have a little invisible indoors marker round them that dismounted the player if you stood by them.
---
I could deal with being dismounted myself, even if it was sometimes accidental if it was to eliminate this issue of players either being inconsiderate or just outright trying to grief people doing it.
---
Not a bad idea, cba to spend too much time doing professions while lvl’ing my self
---
- or /
---
That is a lot of streamers.
---
I have plans for three of one, and one of the other.
---
Paladin and it's not even close
---
Except I have shown evidence and you haven't. When you have factual evidence it isn't an assumption... the evidence you have for your guess so far is??? Right stop trolling.
---
Yeah I’m fiening for a level 60 tbh ahah
---
Paladin and it's not even remotely close
---
I posted a comment on the link but ill post it here aswell. As i knew of an item the article had missed.
---
*I'd like to add the item* [*Green Whelp Armor*](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7375/green-whelp-armor) *to useful anti gank items.*
---
*The pattern has a low droprate from the Yeti's in Hillsbrad Foothills, one of the materials for it,* [*Green Whelp Scale*](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7392/green-whelp-scale) *can be skinned from level 34-36 mobs in the south west corner of Swamp of Sorrows. The drop chance is around 30-40%.*
---
*Available at level 30, quite hard to get at level 30 if you play alone but defenetly invaluable for all that can use leather. I used this item on my Druid on Nostalrius between level 32 and all the way up to 44. Saved me more times than i can remember.*
---
yeah we are very special.
---
wait...what?
---
It was possible, if a whole team reported it the person usually got a 24-48 hour ban.  Happened with a irl friend of mine when he decided to do it for like 30 mins in a pug with me.
---
yeah I had to run my cow legs over to zombie land to get stable servers
---
Actually, we started the summoning ritual before Esfand got here :)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buzmmk/summoning\_omar\_at\_stormwind\_gate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buzmmk/summoning_omar_at_stormwind_gate/)
---
Its quite doom and gloom down in Org right now.
---
John Locke Gang 😎
---
default key for it is forward slash on the numpad to toggle RP walking
---
&gt; Why do you care if people want to get in the beta? I didn't get in, and it doesn't matter to me.
---
I don't. I am not the one who made this post, nor do I care whether or not people want to be in the beta or not.
---
The only purpose of my answer was to point out why your assumption that the current situation on the beta is somehow "never seen before exciting new stuff" is nonsense.
---
I loved this dungeon. 
---
Is it still around in retail?
---
Wish I could go back to playing Wrath with my buddy that committed suicide.
---
the thing about it is that it feels like an ACTUAL gesture. getting +300 health from a friendly priest can completely change the next 30 minutes of your play. getting health on retail is inconsequential when you can pull 15 mobs and grind them all down solo and end the fight at 100% hp
---
Another very important change: I’ve heard that on beta a 14% parry chance, not the 6% chance from private servers. This means that if dual wielding, you will more quickly parry-haste the boss and things could get rocky. I think bear tank is looking better and better, we’ll see what happens.
---
Taunt is not required for tanking normal dungeons as long as the group plays with brains, and Earth shock does a lot of threat.
---
Shamans can tank a lot of the lower level dungeons.
---
And you know, the horde players but lmao who cares about them xD
---
The updated shadow engine makes the game look so fresh and vibrant. I love it.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buzmmk/summoning\_omar\_at\_stormwind\_gate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buzmmk/summoning_omar_at_stormwind_gate/) 
---
Here is where it started :)
---
Haven’t even tried being 60 lol, was 7 back when I played vanilla didn’t understand a word of English
---
That’s what he meant. When you right click, you character turns so that it’s back is facing the camera.
---
Nah it's just this thing where there is a meta, it is a 14 year old meta, people have theorycrafted every little corner of this game. Someone comes along with le skeptic galaxy brain take on a 14 year old game. People explain the commonly known reasons why it isn't feasible and has been asked before. Skeptic begins to shift goal post with comments like frostshock. Well crap, priests can get a net trinket, does that make them good at kiting? Warriors can use a FAP once every 5 minutes, does that mean warriors are unkitable even when they don't have the FAPS that we used to justify the first assertion?
---
If they are a paladin/priest/warlock with fel/druid - your shock gets removed. If they are a mage you don't ever melee a good mage who is going to cone/nova/sheep/blink/r1fb/blizzard you. If they are a hunter, lulz. Rogues have longer cooldowns they may be hesitant to use on shamans so you might catch this one some times. Warriors will destroy an enhancement shaman so unless you have extra cooldowns the warrior doesn't you will not kite hamstring with earth bind or shock.
---
In a battleground there aren't perfect matchups it is sometimes a pit, if the pit has bad players in it, enhancement can do fine. If the fighting in the middle involves a skilled mage or hunter, enhancement gets far less viable whereas a warrior would retain his reliable charges and higher armor, resistances to fear/incapacitate, more reliable burst which more than likely has better crit chance and overall more flexible with sweeping strikes and the healing debuff. Warriors are better at being warriors than enhancement shamans are, basically.  It's just another one of those "for fun, but not the tip top optimal"
---
just imagine if he had said 'thx' and run off and jumped in a lake after the unending breath buff.
---
What did they nerf?
---
Because the game was several years old at the time and 12 million subscribers was still extremely impressive and more people than a lot of entire countries. Why didn't BC hit 20 million if it was better than wrath? Why won't Classic get 100 million subscribers if it's better than both?
---
Also, explain again how the expansion that most people played and paid for isn't the best one. Especially when it had the objectively best content. Which is why it's best. Which is what I'm trying to tell you, and what you and your sources is also telling you.
---
Or actually don't because this comment chain is boring me now and I won't reply. But do go on liking "proof" that proves my point and disproves yours.
---
I played from vanilla and then stopped when the max was 80 I think. Maybe 90. I miss it very much. Specially vanilla and even BC
---
NO
---
Elwynn Forest for a second time around. 
---
I had no issues when I leveled Forsaken but boy is this place just full of toxic players who do nothing but belittle other players for having an opinion, this tug-o-war between "I was there so I know more than you" players or complaining about *everything* especially those darned streamers!
---
Chat has been an awful experience but the players I run in to are great.
---
I do! I was like 14 playing a rogue with my mom as healer (druid), my dad as tank (warrior), and my sister as DPS (shaman). We had a lot of fun! Zul'Farrak is one of my favorites.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot. It'll be on Twitch.
---
He might have been creepy but what he said is very true. Most gankers just want to evoke some reaction.
---
Atleast in personal experience, talking to players who has the mindset of "Red = Dead" and the "play like a bot". Sure, you might get ganked once or twice. After that they don't usually get any enjoyment from killing someone who acts like the ganker doesnt exist.
---
Did your layer have a conga line and a giant OMAR written with players?
---
Someones making a few bucks off cheap flags
---
Except even the brand new players have no problem steamrolling content in quest greens and dungeon blues, so it shouldn't matter you don't have a hat until 35 or whatever.
---
Shit like this is great even if it’s streamers doing stuff it’s still hundreds of other players getting an unforgettable experience. That’s classic for ya
---
even half is generous tbh, i expect server size to be 30% in 3 months of what it was at launch
---
I made so many Hunters in Vanilla/BC. SO MANY HUNTERS. I kept moving servers to be with friends, or when the RP-PvP servers finally came out. This time around? If I honestly have nothing to level, maybe I'll have a second BG Twink Hunter for funsies.
---
Did you have to kite him? grats!
---
It's a bit like [this](https://kathleenodowd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/famcircus0004.jpg).
---
Same exact thing, will u be playing EU or NA servers?
---
Totally agree with you here. It was arrogant af. It will be a meme for a long time to come one way or another, proven right or wrong it was one of the gaming industries giants being blatantly disrespectful in public to its consumers. You are taught in business and pr 101 the customer publicly is always right, even when they are wrong and you know it. What you do privately is one thing but when you speak for a company or industry you never show contempt or disrespect, it’s a sure way to get work and go broke
---
my man, its not a good option unless you are 3-4 levels above par for the dungeon youre doing, I tried it a few months back with 2 friends and they are not intended as tanks.
---
NA horde
---
No. They are tuned to be harder. It was proven by nost devs and blizzard devs
---
Real nice, thanks!
---
its intended. hes always been kitable
---
Since I'm long winded and going here, I'll just reply to myself about why TBC is my favorite.
---
First off, while yes it is obviously an expansion, TBC felt like an extension of Vanilla rather than the closing of one book and the opening of another.  All of the systems were largely the same.  They fixed a lot of what was wrong with class design and balance to what was, for me, a perfect place for each class.  Sorry if you played something other than Paladin/Priest/Shaman and didn't feel that way.  I was personally okay with the Horde getting Paladins and the Alliance Shamans.  
---
From the start, shit was hard.  Shit was real hard.  Then TBC heroics, *AKA FUCK YOU*, happened.  The player base was smarter than before, but it still felt like were that idiot doing VC or SM for the first time.  The novelty of the neutral city was also new and interesting there.
---
Overall, it was some of the best expansion raid content ever.  Hard as shit, attunements sucked, I still love Gruul (fuck anyone who doesn't), it took a long time to do a raid.  Anything else since then, except Ulduar, has felt really weak and not all that weighty or deep.
---
Other oddities:
---
1.  The sets were cool
---
2.  Arena was introduced and, while people knew how to PvP, it was an entirely different level.
---
3.  Flying, while controversial was new and interested.
---
4.  It was the last time I felt professions had real weight
---
5.  While transfers existed, they had a monetary cost and didn't seem to be all that frequent.
---
6.  You still knew *(almost)* everyone on your server.
---
7.  Dailies seemed to be, for me at least, rewarding and intelligently done.  They didn't feel like a chore.
---
This looks like some ookin alliance propaganda, big ook wont grook dook!
---
Our Druid killed it. Warstomps, downranked healing, bandages, we had to use literally everything we had to kill him 😄
---
Ay as well just mush em all into one class. No point really bothering with pretending anymore.
---
Yep then we all started climbing the storm wind statue, I've logged now
---
The ease of the game did not peak at wotlk. So no, the game did not become larger and more popular the easier they made things. Wotlk just represents the perfect balance of ease / difficulty that resulted in their largest player base.  Fyi.
---
Nah it's /exit to exit the dungeon.
---
Fair play, not many EU players out here
---
&gt; If you try to pvp as balance Druid in vanilla in moonkin form you will lose.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
even though this was in classic, this should be fixed.
---
Kinda the reason the article is written. The article doesn't say people shouldn't or won't get ganked. Just how you maybe could get ganked less.
---
Been a long time since I did engi. I did however think it was easier than lw or BS. Lots of stuff needed that isn’t just ore/metal and stone.
---
Great update, this will be useful. Except Dire Maul: South, there is no southern wing.
---
Engineering is pretty much a requirement if you plan on PvP’ing at all seriously.
---
This is one of the reasons I really hope that they will continue WoW Classic on to TBC.  Not get rid of Classic, but add TBC servers with character copies.  Obviously, I know they'll charge for the *new* expansion and a full set of account character copies, but I would be all in for TBC.
---
I can't tell if this is /s or not, but Tuaren weren't rogues in vanilla.
---
I agree with you on the community aspect, it's one of the reasons I can only play retail for a few months at a time before I take another break. The world, even with world quests, world bosses, invasions, etc, doesn't feel alive, because there is no community giving it life. It's just a place to check off boxes on your daily/weekly checklist.
---
Also I didn't mean that Classic would die, I just think the population is going to be severely inflated for a few months by people who aren't going to play it long term. There's probably around 3 mil active subscribers right now, I'd say at least half will try classic out, probably more. How many of those people will last beyond a few months though? And how many people actually make up the current classic community? 500k maybe at the high end?
---
I could obviously be wrong, and there's always a chance Classic will turn into some kind of phenomenon that pulls in a bunch of outside players. I'd be pretty surprised though if by the time Phase 2 starts, there's more than a few hundred thousand people playing it. Which would still plenty of people, and would still be a success.
---
on stress test since 10 is lvl cap, people fully enchant, pot, and gear up for RFC so its possible. im sure no where else would people bother - it would be easier to grab a lvl 13 tank and heals and go. But Stress test meta is wild baby.  
---
i also killed this guy with 5 10s. took a long time and we wiped twice, but it happened. priest healer / druid off heals / warr tank / mage / lock
---
&gt; the best bit about classic being a roaring success is
---
It's not even out yet, you can't say it's a "roaring success."  You can predict that it might be (and hey, you can use real evidence, not this screenshot, to back that), but you can't say that a game that won't be released for three months and has no preorder numbers to check is already a success.  (Besides which, that's like saying Battlefront II was a success, or Battlefield V, or CoD:BlOps 4, because they all sold a lot and had hype leading up to their release.)
---
&gt; They mocked and ridiculed us for wanting it
---
They absolutely did not, but if you need to feel like a victim, hey, pretend to be a victim.
---
&gt; so we went away and built our own. 
---
Please don't say "we" unless you were involved in hosting a server.  If you were, cool.  But you also have it backward.  The private servers existed before a bunch of people pretended to be victimized.
---
&gt; They tried to shut them down, we built more.
---
Yeah, it's totally a win to take someone else's IP and set up a fake server running it.  Oh, and "tried?"  Yeah, maybe explain to Nostalrius how Blizzard only "tried."
---
&gt; the retail slaves
---
Yeah, this is the kind of language that makes people assholes.
---
&gt; pile shit on us for wanting it 
---
No, they pile shit on you for being an asshole.  You're attacking Blizzard, you're calling people who enjoy the current game "slaves," you're being an all-around abhorrent person, and you think it's just because you want Classic on the side?  No.  I want Classic, but I still dislike your comments because you're being an asshole about it.
---
Yeeeaaaahhh...  No, it won't.
---
Hey, I hope it succeeds, because I plan to sink time into it.  But it won't beat the current game, much less become the "norm."  The current game might adopt some stuff from Classic, but people love a lot of the changes made to the game.  A lot of people like the convenience of grouping up easier (and you still have to manually group for some content), shared tags so you don't have bottleneck quests where you have to kill 12 of something but can't unless other people are willing to group so everyone shares anyone's kills (that's an issue in the Forsaken starting area, best idea is to grind and ignore it), AOE looting, transmog (so they can choose which gear they've earned to show off), shared mounts, and other stuff.  I'd love to think that maybe daily/world quests might die off, but they were introduced in BC, which so many people swear was the best ever (and they're not terrible for the most part, just some of them are eh).
---
People also won't want to play a game that can't get new content, because people demanded "proper vanilla WoW."  Even if they tacked on BC eventually, you're just basically going to run out of content, catch up to the current game, or have to change the game in some way, which ultimately breaks the Classic experiment.  (I'm all for a "patch 1.13" and treating it like an AU, but hey, people said they want pure vanilla, so we can't have that.)
---
&gt; And it will be because we said "fuck you" to Activision and their out of touch execs.
---
Well... no, it won't.  Because if it succeeds and grows, it's because they made a decision, and you're paying them money every month.  Let's say there's 2M people playing Classic.  That's $30M/month, $240M/year (almost a quarter of a billion dollars!), going into Activision-Blizzard's coffers, boosting their revenue streams, making their shareholders happy, and earning bonuses for their execs.  Man, I'd love for someone to give me a hefty $10M+ "fuck you" check.
---
I am guessing that was a joke. That never happened in real vanilla, so I am &gt;99% certain it won't happen in Classic.
---
Back when I played a spriest in TBC I was amazed at the number of people who thought Fade was exactly like like Invisibility, Vanish or Feign Death. It's nothing like them. It briefly removes a small amount of threat, then the threat comes back and the end of the duration. That's all it does. It's nice to have when you just barely pull aggro off the tank with heals, but it's close to useless for a DPS toon.
---
Will be playing both.
---
*dwarves
---
I like to think I give random facts to people I pass by when I cast arcane Intellect. And power word fortitude is just a nice compliment to pwrk folks up!
---
What makes engi so necessary for pvp’ing, bombs n stuff like that?
---
this has been mentioned several times already, and everytime it's because they're level capped and doing quests
---
You could learn whatever your class allowed, except polearms and dual-wield were always level 20, with dual-wield being 10 for rogues.
---
They wouldn't be bis, but you can go raiding with them.
---
I said it in another post, but I feel that TBC was exactly that.  It felt more like a move towards perfection of Vanilla rather than a change towards a new system.  Admittedly, I've played spotily since MoP, but everything since hasn't felt like the same game.
---
It's shut down now.
---
Hmm
---
Paladin &gt;Druid for solo tough/elite quests. You basically have 3 life bars as a Paladin.
---
Do note, even after hitting 300 alc you'll be burning thru a ton of herbs. It will be a tall order to farm them all in advance, so you'll definitely be spending a lot at the auction house until you can level an herbalist alt.
---
It would have expired long before he hit a body of water deep enough to dive into. As I said, it was a very dry zone I was in. Nothing nearby with a body of swimable water.
---
All the people in beta are the ones telling us to calm down.
---
Yes, bombs, nets, death rays, etc.
---
SMH. It's built on the modern framework. WoW Classic is NOT the same game as vanilla.
---
&gt; Also, explain again how the expansion that most people played and paid for isn't the best one
---
Why should I? You already made a counter argument for this exact logic in one of your earlier threads
---
This isn't a real discussion anymore
---
Nope! Just got in!
---
Maybe don’t play the lesser faction then.
---
just to add onto what the others said, you can just do a reloadui or whatever the command instead of relogging and it functions the same way
---
Change my mind
---
WotLK content wise was great.  Everything else that went with it was shit.
---
we just wanna be included :(
---
I’d really like that, or some way to rescale expansions for 1-60, rather than adding 10 new levels. So after maybe level 10 I head over to Northrend and can grind up to 60, and all the tiersets kind of match with Tier 1-3.
---
I remember Kungen talking in some of his videos how in TBC flying mounts removed a lot of interaction between people. It's just great that you actually meet a lot of people when travelling, often some same guys you've met in different levelling areas before.
---
This is actually pretty sad :\[
---
Hi, /u/Redycha
---
Lmao good job
---
Enjoy the wait?

---
It was a sad party at Horde' side..
---
how do you get up there?
---
Back in-what is going on lol
---
For the most part no, but there are some gotchas--
---
1) Race doesnt matter unless you want Fear Ward as a priest (then you have to be Alliance, and a Dwarf, because no one else has it)  
---
2) for tanking, warriors are the best, druids are a little worse though still fine, but paladins will have a hard time (no taunts, plus mana depletion issues)
---
3) druids are at a slight disadvantage in raid healing because only one HoT (heal over time) buff is allowed per target, meaning two druids trying to place rejuvenation on the same target will have problems (and druids have a greater focus on HoTs than other healers)  
---
4) some warlock specs, fire mages, etc that do DoTs will have problems in raids because of a similar thing
---
If you're super new to MMOs, min maxing shouldn't be your focus. Learning things like "threat", "rotations", "hit cap", "resource management", and "how not to stand in the fire"  are several orders of magnitude more important.
---
Something something streamer priviledge or something.
---
Undead never quite fit into the horde.
---
The BETA is invite-only.  The stress test isn't.
---
Maybe you should engage in some thinking yourself.
---
Are things like that gonna be available in arena and Bg’s?
---
Since you never actually got to max lvl in wrath, and only stayed in vanilla content, I think you'll find them quite familiar. The seal-judgement playstyle was still present until wrath's end.

WC3 also made the Naga feel more important, though. they were the only playable race outside the main 4. I thought for sure that we'd be getting them in WoW at some point because of that, technical challenges aside
---
Arena doesn’t exist in vanilla. But they are available in BG’s, yes.
---
Yep! I was basically there as a hamstring bot because getting aggro and being hit meant I died lol
---
But all the WSG wins ;)

Yeah, I could imagine. Thanks for the heads up

I see far more dudes that want to be INTJ than those that are actually INTJs. 
---
I'm an ISTP (woman, no less), but I've seen plenty of dudes across several forums try to justify why they didn't get INTJ, and further posts about INTJ is "superior". Among certain people, for whatever reason, INTJ is seen as a status symbol of being special.
---
That's a great tip. I'll make sure to let people know. Thanks everyone!
---
You just level.
---
You can either heal as a non heal specced char which is generally possible as long as you have heal gear.
---
Alternatively, you just find a way to level as heal specced, which is often not that bad.  Many heal specs get stuff that makes them slightly more efficient, like 25% totem cost reduction and 3% hit/spell hit for shamans, or spirit tap/wand spec for priests, or just using cat form for druids.
---
I can totally see stuff like two people buying the same item from the AH within seconds and both of them winning the buyout but only one of them receiving the item -- resulting in one of the players just losing all his gold for nothing.
---
Back to the game after stopping prior to Pandaria. My naked Lvl 85 Tauren Warrior on Laughing Skull is my highest character. My new Lvl 73 Worgen Warrior on another server is my current toon.
---
That's a great tip. I'll let everyone know. Thanks guys!
---
I have really been enjoying Esfand's streams since the beta started. I never was big on Twitch and I'll probably stop visiting once Classic drops, but this whole experience has reminded me a lot of how going to see the movie 'The Room' works. Except the crowd is the chat instead of the theatre goers.. and everyone yells RIGGED during his retbull raffle instead of people throwing spoons.

&lt;Vangar&gt; Is aiming to be a guild that will clear all of the raids while raiding a reasonable amount of hours each week. Vangar is a gaming community founded in late 2014 by a group of friends who have been together for many years. Our community welcomes all and plays a variety of different video games as well as other hobbies like art, music, and other forms of entertainment. Many of our members on vangar have raided together in retail world of warcraft since 2011 and are now looking to form a guild for the release of classic wow. If you are looking for a guild full of people who are determined to clear content, know what they are doing, and have a fun raiding atmosphere, please considering joining us!
---
Goals -
---
\*to clear all of the content efficiently and quickly

---
\*to play at the absolute best of our abilities
---
\*to aim for top 5 server

Loot Rules - We will be using Loot Council that will include input from the raid leader, 3 officers, and each of the class leaders. This system work a lot better than dkp, epgp, or rolling in our opinion. We will be fair and transparent with the loot that drops in our raids. Our decisions on loot will be influenced by: Performance in raid, attendance, contribution to the team as a whole in general, relevance of an item upgrade (tank tier). We think its important for our raiders to understand the following: If you stick with this guild, you will absolutely get fully geared, you need to understand, however, that during progression certain specs and classes need gear over other people. Loot is not a primary focus of raiding within out guild, although it certainly is important.
---
Expectations-
---
We don’t expect much from our raiders. You don’t need to be the best player in the world, all that we are asking is that you are able and willing to put effort into your performance. What does this mean? We want you to be able to take criticism, furthermore, we want you to contribute towards criticism in a polite way. If you are willing to help out, willing to push yourself, and find enjoyment in raiding at the best of YOUR ability and nothing less, then you will fit in perfectly here at Vangar.
---
Our discord server has a lot of information for our members to use and help contribute too. This includes lists of every spec, macros, addons, tips for each class, raid strategies with images of boss rooms, as well as a link to the master classic wow list google sheet spread. We have class leads for each class that will be actively trying to discuss certain aspects of raiding with the class members

Congrats on your great accomplishment.

In the normal beta streams I've seen, I haven't seen that kind of issue.  Yeah, I see people come along trying to murder or grief each other through world PVP, but that's the world PVP experience.  You see someone of the opposite side trying to fight a mob and struggling, you use it as a chance to jump in and wreck them.  It's not particularly being a jerk then, it's just how world PVP is.  People who don't want to deal with it should play on the PVE server.  (I'm not a "PVP snob" either... I stick to PVE servers to avoid that stuff, and won't use "War Mode" in BFA because I know it makes me open season for someone to wreck at any moment, especially when I'm leveling.)
---
Its a good change. Whether it was ij og or not isnt relevant
---
Horde... Not my choice.
---
Man, that was nuts. Rave party at SW gates on multiple layers, easily several thousands of people, and then Omar showed up and joined in with fireworks. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/wKfEF0v
---
Bear in mind the last shot with Omar I was stuck mid-phase so 90% the people arent showing, check the end of Esfand's stream for an accurate look. There were more people on my original layer too.
---
I love this fucking game.
---
Keep in mind that you will need to go to Scholomance to craft flasks.
---
turned into? just cause a popular streamer discovered a less efficient method of a 15 year old trick? you kiddin me?
---
yeah i dont mind streamers doing this stuff at all. seems like a cool thing to see, and they aren't getting some advantage due their followers
---
Does this mean war stomp has a gigantic radius, or does the radius spawn from your center and is unaffected?
---
You can heal anything with a dps spec it just depends on how good your gear is and/or how many other healers are with you.
---
A shadow priest in T2 could probably solo heal UBRS, but a shadow priest in leveling greens will likely struggle solo in Scholo.
---
This looks like a renaissance
---
omg yes, that was my first ever epic and i was so hyped i switched everything to ret to use it as much as possible lmao
---
I never understood why the Undead playable race are called Undead instead of Forsaken.
---
We need more spam of this.
---
I was there as a horde player. It was nuts
---
No...
---
/criesincorner
---
Druids can kite similar to hunters, just worse. Paladins are good at facetanking elites but won't be soloing DM or anything.
---
It seems small but it’s a critical part of the community fabric in vanilla.
---
As a resto druid I loved giving out MotW and thorns. And a quick rejuve for a warrior fighting two mobs? 
---
“I know... you’re welcome.”
---
You then need to realize the troll is like 8 feet tall and is kicking a solid 3 feet over a humans head.
---
A gnome you are really just stunning by your kick height that they choke in evny.
---
This guy pvps
---
Hopefully layering is limited and part time
---
Dont troll warriors start with throw skill?
---
Not vanilla since I wasn’t playing until BC. But yes, I do remember my first time on those stairs. I also remember my first shadowfang keep taking me better than an hour to get through.

Salvation pve. Freedom, bop, and loh for wsgs (no good holy pals being showcased on beta). 1.12 favors alli in AV
---
Our racials are BiS for many classes, gnome pvp, human pve. Stoneform if you hate rogues, NE if you love to gank / defend.
---
No one said it's a good option.
---
But it's possible.
---
And it beats the hell outta not running at all, because of no available tank.

---
No that's definitely correct - even mobs with no loot show the loot tooltip until you've opened the loot table.
---
Not a bug.
---
I miss mammoth lines in Wrath
---
Gosh this needs to be sussed out. Rip gold farming from instance efficiently
---
Yeah, I'm an INFP and I have no clue what I want to play. Lol.
---
Doesn´t concern dungeons and raids
---
true, it always touches me heart to be buffed by someone
---
You just linked a PvP spec, there is no guild who would let you dps with that in raids. Getting in a guild as balance is hard to begin with but if you really want to do it you will need moonkin form. The spec is 38/0/13. You basically get reflection in the resto tree and put the rest in balance. I would never recommend anyone to raid as balance though.
---
Snutz has like 300g before he lost it gambling lol
---
Craft enchanting trinket the swap to BS/Engi.
---
Mind Control Helmet ?
---
Yeah for sure, I liked how he kites the mobs into the pally :) super cool
---
Ive been trying to kill patrol in thousand needles and then players tags it and doesnt party me or reply my whisper.
---
Majority of people are antisocial fucks.
---
&gt; As shocking as it may seem, there are actually millions of people who enjoy retail WoW. 
---
Less than 2 million actually.  Thanks to the October 2018 leaks from Blizzard's develop.battle.net API, active subs were revealed to have dropped to 1.7 million.  Since that time, it's very doubtful that this number has headed back up.
---
Without the group aspect though it'd just be a sandbox openworld game like witchery or skyrim. Or fable, hadn't thought about that game in awhile
---
yes it does, especially dungeons. If your tank pulls while you're at half mana or so you can top him off and immediately begin drinking, significantly decreasing downtime overall
---
Surprisingly balanced.  Vote was 84-84 exactly when I checked.
---
It is so wholesome that he gets credit for his work. Good guy Ion winged it.
---
&gt; Idk I feel like it's a waste of everyone's effort not to have guild banks. The only reason they aren't in is because "muh nochanges"
---
I feel the same about debuff limit. The only thing debuff limit is good for is making certain specs unplayable. Fight me.
---
Fuck gnomer lol
---
If you have a fellow priest with you one can MC and the other buff
---
go look up pantheon rise of the fallen, its literally the mmo im waiting for and playing classic wow while waiting for it
---
Those items helped a lot of people level up alts and stick with the game.  You quit the game 13 years ago so it’s not like blizz cares what you think about what current players want or wanted as the game developed.
---
I main hunter and if someone gives me a buff you better believe whatever mob I see them fighting is getting a serpent sting or raptor strike
---
I’m not in the beta and think people that act like beta is the end all be all need to calm down. Some people are really way to obsessed about betas.
---
Those bodies filling the space were still far more competent than what you'd find in guilds that couldn't even break into BWL.  The simple stats of how many raiders completed Naxx, let alone killed any bosses in it, clearly reinforces that getting gear in vanilla was hardly a matter of putting enough time into it as the person I was replying to was implying.
---
In fact the top guilds on my server back in vanilla actually raided *fewer* hours than many guilds who never got farther than the first few bosses in BWL.  To think someone in full BWL, some AQ40, and any tier 3 gear got that through "time spent... mindless grinding" is just a false statement.
---
Hi, /u/RedFactoryDev
---
From the outside, to the right side of the castle gate's wall. You can jump between the terrain and the wall itself to get up.
---
It is never before seen and exciting. Can you name a time where every single person on the server stops at level 30 to try and min/max what they can do? It is a unique situation and I see why people would be bummed they didn't get in.
---
True!  restart now
---
One of two lead devs for classic.
---
Was the restart just for beta realms? Weird for them to say servers would be back when the test was over an hour ago.
---
Just restarted the server and it will "maybe" come back
---
Like the sharding they are doing?
---
That's what layering is supposed to be going to do.
---
I've always gotten INFP so I chose that with Warlock. After taking it again I got ENFP so I guess I should have done that before hand I would have been the special snowflake.
---
inb4 we get layering *and* sharding
---
I agree, they said they're stopping a couple weeks ideally, by phase 2 for sure. I think the servers would be ded way sooner without it though, today.
---
We got nothing :(
---
Are you playing on the PvP server?
---
Is it hard to avoid dying when running through all the zones? Thanks for posting this btw.
---
They actually did nothing for Horde. That was pretty lame. :\
---
3 Factions would have been way better for bgs. even if your server was 50/25/25 then the over pop faction could still get pops at a decent rate. 2 factions should just have had bgs where you can vs your own faction. The first group of 10 for wsg or 15 for arathi vs' the 2nd group of 10/15. So you could go Alliance vs Horde, Alliance vs Alliance or Horde vs Horde.
---
But for most players the question would be, why do the new content? It can work but its certainly ly the least popular choice. Content for the sake of content just doesnt seam to make wow players happy. Power fantasy seems most important.
---
Man I really miss the ventrilo "bemp - bump" ptt sound
---
Alliance bias
